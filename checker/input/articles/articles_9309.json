    "text": "Best Of 2023: Musicians who made their mark As we approach the end of the year, we’ve been reflecting on our favorite conversations throughout 2023. This hour, host Catherine Shen chooses her most memorable moments all about music. First, we discuss the power of nostalgia and the memories music can carry with John Ondrasik, frontman for Five for Fighting. The soft-rock band topped the charts in the early 2000s with songs like \"Superman\" and \"100 Years.\" Eric George Lopez, or ericdoa, has been described as the \"face of hyperpop,\" a newer music genre born out of 2000s electronic music. But in many ways, the \"genre-bending\" up-and-coming artist defies categorization. He discusses his upbringing in Connecticut, how he developed his sound and what makes Gen Z uniquely powerful in the arts. Plus, Ashley Hamel discovered her love of music while growing up in Connecticut. The singer-songwriter eventually left New England behind to build her music career in Indonesia. She joined us from Jakarta to talk about her new single, \"New England Baby.\" Full episodes: [A conversation with Five for Fighting frontman John Ondrasik](https://www.ctpublic.org/show/where-we-live/2023-06-20/a-conversation-with-five-for-fighting-frontman-john-ondrasik) [CT-based Gen Z trailblazers: Musician ericdoa, K-pop dance crew SEOULAR, and designer MINIPNG](https://www.ctpublic.org/show/where-we-live/2023-11-02/ct-based-gen-z-trailblazers-musician-ericdoa-k-pop-dance-crew-seoular-and-designer-minipng) [Ashley Hamel takes her music to new heights abroad, plus a look at the ticketing industry](https://www.ctpublic.org/show/where-we-live/2023-09-28/ashley-hamel-takes-her-music-to-new-heights-abroad-plus-a-look-at-the-ticketing-industry) Where We Live is available as a podcast on [Apple Podcasts,](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/where-we-live/id706066099) [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0j08SgnZIU5BmjDyHbgjgP), [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvYWMwYmU5NjktZDdkZi00NjBjLWE2NmMtYTZmOTAwZTFlYmQxL2VhY2I0ZTJmLTFiM2ItNGEyZC1hM2Y3LWE5ZmIwMDYxODYyMC8xNTgwZWM0Yi1kZTM1LTQ4ZmUtOTViNi1hOWZiMDA2MTg2MjAvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M), [Amazon Music](https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/43f3a507-ebfa-4876-b34a-030759a8924c/where-we-live), [TuneIn](https://tunein.com/podcasts/Government/Where-We-Live-p1207905/), [Listen Notes,](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/where-we-live-connecticut-public-radio-lz9NAwSEexh/) or wherever you get your podcasts.

    "text": "Wuyuan's natural beauty mesmerizes\nNANCHANG — Since mid-March, Wuyuan county in Jiangxi province has entered its most enchanting season.\nAcross the undulating hills, a stunning expanse of 6,700 hectares of rapeseed flowers has burst into bloom, painting the landscape in vibrant hues of gold.\nAs the flowers reach their peak, waves of visitors from across the country witness this natural spectacle, turning Wuyuan into a bustling haven of beauty.\nScattered with historical sites and ancient buildings of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, Wuyuan boasts 30 traditional villages. In 2012, the county government adopted measures to protect and develop the ancient buildings.\nThe idyllic lifestyle has not only encouraged locals to return but also attracted many outsiders to settle down. Among them is Edward Gawne, the first British national to open a homestay in Wuyuan.\n\"There are trees, bridges, flowing water and beautiful Huizhou-style houses. It is how I imagined traditional Chinese culture would look like,\" Gawne said.\nWith China's ever-expanding high-speed rail network making the once-remote countryside easily accessible, Wuyuan has even attracted the interest of overseas travelers.\n\"Our B&B has served as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the West. About 90 percent of our guests are foreigners, and they can enjoy the beauty of Chinese traditional villages and learn about the culture and folk customs of Wuyuan and Jiangxi,\" Gawne said.\nThe story of Wuyuan is a shining example of how China's poverty alleviation and rural vitalization efforts have transformed the lives of countryside residents.\nOnce economically stagnant, the county of more than 300,000 people has undergone a remarkable transformation through land reform, poverty alleviation and infrastructure upgrades.\nSince the 2000s, Wuyuan has adopted an agriculture-tourism integration development model, combining traditional farming with tourism to develop distinctive industries such as rapeseed flower and chrysanthemum cultivation.\nThe initiative has spurred the growth of rural homestays, lifting the annual average per-capita income to more than 26,000 yuan ($3,600) in 2023 from less than 3,000 yuan in 2002.\nIn 2023, Wuyuan welcomed over 28 million visitors, cementing its status as a top-tier tourist destination in rural China.\nAs China's rural vitalization gains momentum, Wuyuan is further transforming its local resources into a thriving, diverse tourism industry. A nature education hub operated by young graduates has become an in-demand destination with eager participants booking spots three months in advance.\nFrom wetland explorations and building bird nests to observing bacteria under microscopes, the education hub's hands-on activities captivate children and parents alike.\n\"We're using Wuyuan's natural beauty and our expertise to make science fun and accessible,\" said Liu Zhilong, who runs the nature education hub, adding that over 60,000 children and 10,000 parents have joined their nature lessons.\nThese achievements stem from Wuyuan's groundbreaking \"mini nature reserve\" system, launched in the early 1990s. Today, the county boasts 193 such reserves, spanning 43,600 hectares and safeguarding rare species such as the critically endangered blue-crowned laughing-thrush.\nThis dedication to conservation has fueled economic growth, with bird-watching tourism alone generating over 100 million yuan in 2023.\nParty chief Xu Shubin stated that Wuyuan has successfully turned its ecological strengths into economic benefits.\nVillagers, now reaping the rewards of this green development, have become even more dedicated to protecting their beautiful homeland.\n\"This commitment has fostered a win-win cycle. Protecting the environment drives the green economy, and the resulting success inspires villagers to care even more for their natural surroundings, promoting true harmony between people and nature,\" Xu said.\nXinhua",

This marks a strong start to the year for the company, driven by significant growth in global box office earnings and an increase in system sales and installations.\nAccording to CEO Rich Gelfond, IMAX is poised for sustained growth, bolstered by an impressive lineup of global releases planned for the coming years and heightened demand from movie exhibitors. This growth trajectory is reflected in the company's performance across several strategic areas, including local language productions and alternative content, which have shown considerable gains.\nIMAX witnessed a notable performance in the Chinese market, with a record-setting Chinese New Year season contributing to the company's success. Despite a slower performance from the Hollywood sector initially, IMAX's diverse content offerings have more than compensated, positioning the company to capitalize on promising future trends in global content delivery.\nWall Street Analysts Forecast\nBased on the one-year price targets offered by 10 analysts, the average target price for Imax Corp (IMAX, Financial) is $30.40 with a high estimate of $36.00 and a low estimate of $16.00.

More detailed data can be found on the Imax Corp (IMAX) Summary page.\nKey Business Developments\nRelease Date: February 19, 2025\n- Adjusted EBITDA (Q4 2024): $37 million, up 48% year-over-year.\n- Adjusted EPS (Q4 2024): $0.27, up 59% year-over-year.\n- Full Year Revenue (2024): $352 million.\n- Adjusted EBITDA Margin (2024): 39%.\n- Operating Cash Flow (2024): $71 million, a 21% improvement year-over-year.\n- System Installations (2024): 146 systems, with 57% under joint revenue sharing arrangements.\n- Q4 Revenue (2024): $93 million, up 8% year-over-year.\n- Content Solutions Revenue (Q4 2024): $26 million, up 34% year-over-year.\n- Technology Products and Services Revenue (Q4 2024): $64 million, up 2% year-over-year.\n- Q4 Gross Margin (2024): 52%.\n- SG&A (Q4 2024): $27 million, a $2 million improvement year-over-year.\n- Cash Position (End of 2024): $101 million.\n- Debt (End of 2024): $269 million.\n- Capital Expenditure (2024): $41 million.\n- Share Repurchases (2024): $18 million.\n- 2025 Box Office Guidance: Over $1.2 billion.\n- System Installation Guidance (2025): 145 to 160 systems.\n- Adjusted EBITDA Margin Guidance (2025): Minimum 40%.\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\nPositive Points\n- Imax Corp (\nIMAX,Financial) reported a record-breaking Chinese New Year slate, with more than $120 million in box office revenue, indicating strong demand in China. - The company expanded its global network, securing partnerships with major exhibitors like Wanda and AMC, and entered agreements with new partners across North America.\n- Imax Corp (IMAX) achieved solid financial results for the fourth quarter, with adjusted EBITDA up 48% to $37 million and adjusted EPS up 59% to $0.27 per share.\n- The company has a promising film slate for 2025, including major titles like Avatar 3, Mission Impossible, and Marvel's Thunderbolts, which are expected to drive box office growth.\n- Imax Corp (IMAX) successfully negotiated a first-of-its-kind partnership with Netflix for exclusive IMAX releases, showcasing its leverage and unique standing in the market.\nNegative Points\n- The company faced a significant headwind in 2024 due to softness in the China box office, impacting overall financial performance.\n- Despite strong results, the fourth-quarter box office fell short of expectations due to underperformance in China and a softer-than-expected Christmas holiday period.\n- Imax Corp (IMAX) dealt with headwinds from an uneven strike-impacted slate and weak foreign currency as the U.S. dollar strengthened.\n- The company has a convertible senior note due in April 2026, which may require strategic financial planning for maturity.\n- There is uncertainty regarding the impact of the 'Ne Zha effect' on future business in China, as the extent of its influence on screen signings and market share is still unknown.",
