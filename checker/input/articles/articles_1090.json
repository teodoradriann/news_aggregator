    "text": "On 7 March, the European Peace Facility delivered new buses to further strengthen the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). This delivery is part of the assistance measure worth €31 million adopted on 15 December 2021 by the EU under the European Peace Facility (EPF). Earlier, as part of this measure, the EPF delivered 12 buses in February. Other deliveries under the military medical component of the assistance measure have included six surgery tables, six portable digital X-ray machines, 50 ambulances, 27,325 first aid kits, and other medical devices. The assistance measure has also provided demining equipment such as mine detectors, trailers with a container for transporting collected mines and explosives from collection to disposal sites, other demining toolkits and ground mobility and logistics facilities, namely off-road trucks and minibuses. Since the beginning of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU has agreed on providing military equipment to help the AFU defend Ukraine’s territorial integrity and population for €5.6 billion through the EPF.

    "text": "A yellow weather warning for rain and snow has been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. The warning is in place from 8am until 3pm on Saturday and up to 25mm of rain is expected in lower levels of Scotland, according to the Met Office. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain on Saturday, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. This week, Storm Gerrit caused travel disruption across the UK. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Travellers faced disruption across the rail network with operators urging passengers to check their journeys before setting off. Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: “Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. “Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Every enemy type will pose unique challenges – every weapon you create will meet those challenges!\"\nKey Features:\nTHE DIVINE METAL: You are Aran de Lira, firstborn of the King’s Ward. The newly crowned Queen Nerea has cast a spell that turns steel into stone. Only her army of abominations wield the divine metal against which other blades shatter.\nTHE FORGE: Find Forge Scrolls, develop your forging skills and craft your weapon to suit your fighting style. The chosen weapon family and the materials you create it from will affect characteristics such as weight, length, durability, penetration and edge quality.\nCHOOSE YOUR WEAPON: Choose between seven different weapon families and over 30 unique Forge Scrolls, which allow almost infinite weapon combinations. Your choice of weapon will be crucial when facing your enemy!\nTACTICAL COMBAT: A unique and challenging combat system which allows you to attack specific body parts of the enemy.

It was a great action game with an amazing story. Our review then highlighted the game's bosses and cinematics as part of the appeal.\nUnfortunately, its sequel, Lords of Shadow 2, was not only marred by technical issues, but even the gameplay didn't live up to its potential, which our review noted as well, giving it a 5.5/10 score. Rounding out the trilogy was Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, which didn't even get a home console release, and was relegated to the Nintendo DS.\nWill MercurySteam be able to bring back its past glory with Blade of Fire? It seems to be on the right track. Luckily, we won't have to wait long, as the game will be available on May 22 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC (via Epic Games Store) for $59.99.\nRelated\n 10 Best Vampire Manga, Ranked\nDive into some of the best vampire manga series like Hellsing, Seraph of the End, and Blood+ for a thrilling read.\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow\n- Franchise\nCastlevania- Released\n- October 5, 2010\n- Developer(s)\n- Multiplayer\n- Local Multiplayer",

    "title": "'It is historic': US poised to see record drop in yearly homicides despite public concern over crime",
    "text": "The year is expected to end with over 2,000 fewer murders than in 2022.\nWith 2023 ticking down, the nation is poised to finish the year with its biggest annual drop in homicides on record, according to preliminary data from law enforcement agencies both large and small.\nThe homicide rate in the United States is expected to plummet nearly 13% compared to 2022, meaning more than 2,000 fewer people were the victims of homicide this year, Jeff Asher, a national crime analyst, told ABC News.\nThe drop in homicides comes as more than three-quarters of Americans say there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans say the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll released last month. Adding to that perception is the annual National Crime Victimization Survey published this month by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics that found the number of violent crime victims nationwide climbed from 16.5 per 1,000 people in 2021 to 23.5 per 1,000 in 2022.\nCities say the 2023 drop in homicides and other violent crimes can be attributed to expanded efforts to prevent crime, including working with community volunteers, targeting gun possession in high-crime areas and placing officers on foot and bike patrols.\n\"It is historic. It's the largest one-year decline,\" said Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former crime analyst for the CIA and the New Orleans Police Department. \"It's cities of every size, it's the suburbs, it's rural counties, tiny cities, it's large cities. It's really a national decline.\"\nAsher said his analysis is based on available preliminary crime data provided by 180 law enforcement agencies.\nHe said before this year, the largest year-over-year drop in homicides occurred in 1996 when murders fell by 9%.\nAn ABC News review of preliminary crime data from the 10 largest U.S. cities shows that heading into the last week of the year, seven of the municipalities have seen double-digit year-over-year declines in 2023 homicides -- including an 11% drop in New York City, a 16% decrease in Los Angeles, and a 13% reduction in Chicago.\nHouston, the country's fourth largest city, saw its homicide numbers fall by 11% and homicides in Philadelphia, the nation's sixth biggest city, have fallen by 21%, according to the preliminary data.\nThe challenge faced by local law enforcement to bring down the country's homicide numbers for the second consecutive year following a record jump in 2020 and a sizable increase in 2021, was achieved this year with a major assist from the U.S. Justice Department and bipartisan gun-control legislation passed by Congress, officials said.\n\"We're seeing double-digit declines in homicide across nearly 70 of America's largest cities,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in an exclusive interview with ABC News chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas, citing information from the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\nMonaco said the federal government has played the role of \"force multiplier\" in helping local law enforcement drive down the nation's murder rate by identifying and removing the most prolific shooters and violent offenders from the streets.\n\"Something that we are doing is using new authorities from the most significant gun safety law that has passed in 30 years ... the bipartisan Safer Communities Act that passed last year. And with that tool, we've charged more than 300 defendants with new gun trafficking and illegal trafficking,\" Monaco told ABC News. \"We're using tools like crime-gun intelligence, the ability to trace the gun and the spent shell casing from a crime scene to identify who's that shooter, how many violent crimes have they been involved with.\"\nSmaller cities are also seeing dramatic decreases in homicides. New Orleans, which had the highest murder rate in the nation in 2022, has seen a 25% drop in homicides in 2023. Baltimore's homicide numbers have fallen by 25%, Atlanta's by 18%, and Miami's by 15%.\nBut not all cities have seen homicides fall. As of Dec. 26, Washington, D.C., has seen its homicides jump 36% and Dallas has seen a 14% increase. In Memphis, Tennessee, homicides rose 31% through the first six months of the year, the most recent data available.\n\"But those cities are especially notable because they are outliers this year, not the norm,\" Asher said.\nOne of the largest drops in homicides occurred in Detroit, which as of Dec. 26 has seen murders fall by 18% since last year, according to the police department's preliminary data.\n\"We're looking at some numbers that we haven't seen in close to 60 years in the city of Detroit,\" Detroit Police Chief James White told ABC News. \"But we're stopping short of celebrating because certainly we still have a lot of work to do.\"\nFollowing a rash of shootings in downtown Detroit in April, White immediately instituted a 12-point crimefighting program normally reserved for the hot summer months, he said.\n\"That involved just really having officers on foot patrol, bike patrol, engaging our community in a very positive way,\" said White.\nHe said the city, led by Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Wayne County prosecutor, has helped pave the way for an overall reduction in crime by boosting the number of police officers from 2,331 in 2022 to 2,486 in 2023 and giving cops a substantial pay raise. White said his department has been approved to hire another 200 officers in the coming year.\nLike other chiefs interviewed by ABC News, White attributed a large part of Detroit's crime turnaround to winning back the public's trust following widespread protests and calls for defunding police departments in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020. White said the city forged relationships with \"community violence interrupters,\" civilians who work in the streets to help the police department pinpoint problem areas and solve crimes.\n\"They're sick and tired of the senseless, violent crime and they're cooperating. They're telling us where the problems are, and it's our responsibility to address them quickly and keep working to keep those relationships strong in the community,\" White said about community violence interrupters.\nThe result, he said, has been 55 fewer homicides in the city compared to this time last year.\n\"That's 55 lives, 55 people, 55 mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters that don't have to bury a loved one,\" White said.\nWhite also noted that there have been 135 fewer non-fatal shootings in Detroit compared to last year.\n\"So if half of those had resulted in homicide, you can clearly see what the numbers would be, and the victimization that would have occurred, the families that would be impacted. But the fact that 135 people weren't shot this year is absolutely incredible,\" White said.\nBesides the tumbling homicide numbers nationwide, Asher said preliminary data shows significant decreases in nearly every type of violent and property crime, except for auto theft which has risen 10%. Through the first three quarters of the year, he said aggravated assaults were down 7%, robbery declined 9% and the number of rapes fell 15%.\n\"It's something that I think ideally deserves more attention. We certainly pay attention when things go up,\" Asher said. \"I think that we should be talking about it and writing about it, and discussing it when it goes down as well because there are important things to learn there, and we should be acknowledging what's happening.\"\nDespite the reductions in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide, recent polls indicate the majority of Americans believe overall crime is out of control.\n\"Seventy-something percent of Americans believe crime is rising this year. And seventy-something percent of Americans in this case just happen to be wrong,\" Asher said, citing the Gallup poll last month.\nAsher's analysis appears to correspond with a report released last week by the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank comprised of policy leaders in the criminal justice field. The CCJ analyzed preliminary crime data from 30 large U.S. cities and found that homicides in the first half of the year fell 9.4%.\n\"If this trend continues through the end of 2023, the nation will have experienced one of the largest single-year homicide reductions in the era of modern record-keeping,\" the CCJ said in a statement.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings across the nation, also reports a significant 9% drop in gun homicides this year. As of Dec. 26, 18,513 people had been victims of homicide, about 1,700 fewer than in 2022, according to the website.\nThe sizable fall in homicides comes after a record high in murders was set in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when courts were mostly closed and jail populations were being drastically reduced in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"Certainly, after it hit, we saw backlogs of cases and delayed trials and things like that,\" White said. \"There was no real accountability for bad acts.\"\nAccording to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which analyzed data from 15,897 law enforcement agencies, the largest single-year jump in murders in more than a century occurred between 2019 and 2020 as murders and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses nationwide rose nearly 30%.\nHomicides across the country continued to increase in 2021 by 4.3% before falling by 6% in 2022, according to the FBI report.\nSan Antonio, Texas, the nation's seventh biggest city, has experienced a nearly 12% decline in homicides this year, after seeing murders rise by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021.\nSan Antonio Police Chief William McManus told ABC News that the 231 homicides that occurred in his city in 2022, included the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of an abandoned tractor-trailer as part of a human smuggling operation.\n\"If you're looking at including those numbers, we're looking at about a 32% decrease. But if you extract those numbers, we're looking at a 12% decrease year-to-date,\" McManus said. \"But we're not complaining about 12% though.\"\nOne of the multiple crimefighting strategies McManus attributed to his city's falling homicide numbers was first suggested by a team of criminologists at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\"Actually, it was a very simple strategy that, quite frankly, I was somewhat skeptical of at first,\" McManus said.\nHe said by examining calls to the city's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD), the police department identified 28 areas of the city with the highest numbers of violent crime calls and even pinpointed certain days and times when the volume of calls is the highest.\n\"We will sit there at that location with our emergency lights on for 10 to 15 minutes. That's about as proactive as it gets,\" McManus said. \"We're not getting out stopping people or knocking on doors or anything like that. It's simply a high visibility, hot-spot policing effort.\"\nMcManus said that in the coming year, he plans to try other crimefighting strategies involving the city's public works department and animal control services.\n\"Specifically, to mention Animal Care Services, if you have a bunch of dogs running around, it brings the quality of life in that neighborhood down,\" McManus said. \"If you have a bunch of abandoned properties that are not being tended to, it brings the quality of life of that neighborhood down. Those properties could be used for drug sales, drug use, prostitution, all those things that make a neighborhood feel unsafe.\"\nAnother strategy is to \"address specific actors that are involved in violent crime,\" he said.\n\"We pull them in, most of them are under supervision, and we offer them services, we offer them possible employment. If you choose to accept that type of help, whatever it may be, then good for you,\" McManus said. \"But if you don't, then the next time you're arrested, we're going to throw the book at you.\"\nIn Phoenix, the nation's fifth largest city, interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan credited a 15% decline in homicides this year to a crimefighting strategy focused on clearing the streets of violent criminals in possession of guns.\n\"We know that if we focus on those areas, we're going to see reductions, and we did this year,\" Sullivan told ABC News.\nSullivan said his department launched \"Operation Summer Shield\" this year, which involved the help of federal and other local law enforcement agencies to round up people with warrants for their arrests. He said the operation resulted in the arrests of 580 people, with 70% wanted for felonies.\n\"I think we seized 40 guns from those prohibited possessors,\" Sullivan said.\nSullivan said he has also used the strategy of putting detectives on the streets during the summer months to help increase patrols, saying, such a move has \"been very important in helping us control the homicide number this year.\"\nLike in Detroit, Sullivan said non-fatal shootings, which he described as \"truly failed homicides,\" are down 18% this year and attributes that to the launch of a \"Non-Fatal Shooting Investigation Squad\" that responds whenever a bullet pierces the skin to assist or assume the investigation.\nBut like other police chiefs in cities with falling homicide numbers, Sullivan said community engagement has been the most beneficial in the post-pandemic era.\n\"Community engagement is much easier when you're not doing it on a Zoom call, when you're having face-to-face meetings with the community and being able to build that trust,\" Sullivan said. \"When I talk about community engagement, you put a lot of deposits in the bank before people trust enough to be able to give us the information to close crimes.\"\nSullivan said his agency has also focused on recruiting the best officers for the job.\n\"What we would expect from our police departments is to have a good strategy. But then you have to have women and men who can go out and execute that strategy,\" Sullivan said. \"That's what we have here at the Phoenix Police Department, and I believe that's a recipe for success.\"",

    "title": "Medio Oriente, Israele aspetta l’attacco. L’Iran: sarà una sorpresa. Al Cairo al via le ultime trattative",
    "text": "Sempre più in bilico la pace in Medio Oriente. Tutti trattano, da Israele a Hamas, dagli americani agli egiziani, dagli iraniani al Qatar passando per Giordania, Siria, Turchia e Europa. Ma né Yahya Sinwar, il capo di Hamas barricato nella “metropolitana” di Gaza, né il premier israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu, che insiste per la vittoria totale, intendono cedere realmente. Il nodo del corridoio Filadelfia, che segna il confine fra la Striscia e l’Egitto, diventa un affaire diplomatico in cui a non arretrare sono in primo luogo gli egiziani, che ieri in extremis hanno presentato come «apertura» la disponibilità di Hamas ad accettare una forza internazionale a presidio. Appellandosi al Trattato di pace con Israele, i mediatori di Al-Sisi non ammettono che si installino in modo permanente militari con la Stella di David su quella frontiera. Netanyahu, da parte sua, ha talmente a cuore il Corridoio Filadelfia che ha ordinato ai suoi portavoce di uscire con una dichiarazione in cui ribadisce, smentendo le ipotesi di apertura riportate dai media americani, che Israele «insisterà sul raggiungimento di tutti i suoi obiettivi di guerra, così come sono stati definiti dal gabinetto di sicurezza, compreso il fatto che Gaza non costituisca più una minaccia per la sicurezza di Israele e ciò richiede la messa in sicurezza del confine sud». Niente disimpegno, niente mappa con riduzioni di militari dislocati lungo il corridoio, come suggerito dai media vicini alla Casa Bianca. GLI SFORZI USA Joe Biden ha detto che nella telefonata dell’altra sera con Netanyahu gli ha esposto «gli sforzi degli Stati Uniti per la difesa di Israele contro le minacce che provengono dall’Iran e dai suoi gruppi terroristici», ma gli ha pure chiarito che bisogna «portare a termine l’accordo su cessate il fuoco e liberazione degli ostaggi», infine ha discusso i colloqui del Cairo di oggi e domani per «rimuovere eventuali ostacoli rimanenti». Il Wall Street Journal assicura che Biden ha usato il pacchetto da 20 miliardi di aiuti militari per Israele come leva negoziale su Netanyahu, senza successo. Le speranze di intesa sono al lumicino e i segnali vanno tutti nella direzione del fallimento, che aprirebbe le porte alla rappresaglia iraniana contro le uccisioni israeliane del leader di Hamas e del capo militare di Hezbollah a Teheran e Beirut. «I tempi della risposta, che servirà da deterrente, saranno meticolosamente orchestrati perché avvenga in un momento di massima sorpresa», fa sapere la missione permanente dell’Iran presso l’Onu. «L’aggressore va punito per il suo atto di terrorismo e le violazioni alla nostra sovranità nazionale». Tra i segnali dell’escalation, l’invito della Cina ai propri concittadini a lasciare al più presto il Libano per via della «grave e complessa situazione della sicurezza» o, se devono restare, almeno siano «vigili, rafforzino le precauzioni ed evitino di andare nelle aree a rischio». Altro segnale l’arrivo dal Pacifico della portaerei USS Abraham Lincoln, che si affianca col suo gruppo di battaglia alla Roosevelt e al sommergibile lanciamissili Georgia. Tensione alle stelle nel Mar Rosso, dove i ribelli filo-iraniani Houthi hanno ripetutamente attaccato la petroliera greca Sounion e un cacciatorpediniere francese della missione europea Aspides ha messo in salvo 29 marinai, per lo più russi e filippini, mentre a bordo scoppiava un incendio. LE VITTIME E prosegue la guerra di Gaza, con l’esercito israeliano che ha ucciso 17 persone, ben 11 distruggendo una sola casa nel campo di Al-Maghazi, e ordinato di evacuare zone di Deir al-Balah, centro della Striscia, e Khan Younis, nel Sud, per smantellare strutture militari, razzi e eliminare miliziani. I media israeliani scrivono del 19enne che avrebbe tradito il numero 2 di Hamas a Gaza, Deif, ucciso in un raid, e adesso si troverebbe già in Usa dove ha chiesto asilo politico. Quattro invece i terroristi israeliani arrestati in Israele per raid assassini e incendiari nei villaggi della Cisgiordania. Un fenomeno, dice il capo dello Shin Bet Ronen Bar a Netanyahu, che «ci porta sull’orlo del disastro». Tragica la situazione degli ostaggi. L’esercito ha confermato che sui corpi degli ultimi sei cadaveri recuperati, per lo più anziani presi nei Kibbutz, ci sono colpi d’arma da fuoco. Sette sarebbero in mano alla Jihad islamica. Una sessantina in tutto. Tra loro 12 donne, 7 civili e 5 soldatesse 20enni, le vedette disarmate sulla barriera con Gaza, riprese sanguinanti in un video. Tra le civili Eden Yerushalmi, 24 anni, nascosta tra i cespugli di lavanda nel deserto del Nova Music Festival a inviare sms alla polizia e alla madre («Mi stanno sparando, sono morta»), prima di venire trascinata via. «Perdo sangue, tutti qui perdiamo sangue», l’ultimo messaggio. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

About SPN-820 SPN-820 is a first-in-class, orally active small molecule that increases the brain mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) mediated synaptic function intracellularly. SPN-820 is being developed to provide a rapid-onset antidepressant response via oral administration for adult patients with depression. The compound has a novel mechanism of action that enhances synaptic activity and cellular metabolism in the brain and has demonstrated a rapid onset of action (signal at two hours) in early clinical studies. SPN-820 is expected to provide rapid antidepressant efficacy without potential dissociative side effects. A Phase 2b clinical study of SPN-820 in approximately 227 adult patients with treatment-resistant depression is ongoing. About the SPN-820 Phase 2a Clinical Study The study is a Phase 2a open-label study in 40 subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary objective of the study is to assess efficacy in MDD, as well as onset of efficacy and safety. About Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
