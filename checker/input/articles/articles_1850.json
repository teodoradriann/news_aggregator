    "text": "HEADLINES: -Winter Weather Advisory -1\\\" to 3\\\" of snow for many -Snow begins Monday morning. LET IT SNOW!! LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOW Howdy everyone! We have snow moving our Monday into early Tuesday. But it's NOT a typical snow for us. Long read, with hopefully good info: Normally, you’ll hear us discussing a Low-pressure swirl. Maybe a coastal storm, something big coming up from the south-- not this time. This snow is simply occurring from favorable upper level wind, and it’s cold! Instead of precip twirling around a Low, we’ll see random stripes and blobs of snow showing up on the radar. This includes Central Virginia and parts of Southside. No warm air upstairs at 5,000 ft (as there’s no Low to pull it in.) Light to occasional light snow. Light snow begins Monday morning and will occasionally fall much of the day into Monday night and Tuesday morning. Sometimes a little heavier, but nothing resembling a major snowstorm. The mystery: how much sticks? Confidence is high that nearly everyone in the ABC13 area will see snow falling (because no warm air is pulled in overhead), but how much accumulates? We can observe snow sticking at 33 to 35 when it’s falling faster than it can melt. But this is light snow. So are these totals too high? Do we have hours of snow falling, yet nothing sticks? No, I don't know how much snow sticks to roads. Bridges will be more slippery than regular roads. Temperatures will hover between 28 to 34. Less slow sticking east toward Richmond and south toward Danville. LET IT SNOW!! And this one is a bit of mystery how much snow measures up in our yards - George \",\"forecast\":",

    "text": "Intense rain: Delhi records another extreme weather event This monsoon, Delhi has received 554.6mm of rainfall between June 1 and August 1, with two individual spells of 228.1mm on June 28 and 107.6mm on August 1 accounting for over 60.5% of the total New Delhi The Capital received 107.6mm of rainfall between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, marking yet another extreme weather event this monsoon as it eclipsed the total rainfall recorded in the entirety of August in 2023, as well as 2022, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data for the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered representative of Delhi weather. This monsoon, Delhi has received 554.6mm of rainfall between June 1 and August 1, with two individual spells of 228.1mm on June 28 and 107.6mm on August 1 accounting for over 60.5% of the total. Further, 107.6mm was the single highest-day rainfall recorded by the Safdarjung observatory since 2021, when 138.8mm of rainfall was recorded on August 21, 2021. The overall rainfall in August 2022 was 41.6mm and in August 2023 was 91.8mm. To be sure, the rainfall recorded on the last day of a month is added to the total of the next month, i.e., the rainfall recorded since 6.30pm on July 31 will be counted under the total rainfall for August. Between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, at least seven stations across Delhi-NCR received over 100mm of rainfall, according to IMD data. The Mayur Vihar weather station in east Delhi clocked 147.5mm, Delhi University station in north Delhi logged 104.5mm, Safdarjung and Lodhi Road stations in New Delhi areas clocked 107.6mm and 107.5mm, respectively, Najafgarh station in southwest Delhi logged 113mm, and Pusa station in west Delhi logged 86mm. Neighbouring Gurugram clocked 119.5mm, and on the other side, Noida clocked 145mm of rainfall, indicating widespread and equally intense rainfall across the national capital region. The other IMD stations to receive “heavy” rainfall — over 64.4mm in a 24-hour period — were Ayanagar (71.4mm) and Palam (68mm). “Such rain occurred due to the monsoon trough coming over Delhi-NCR. Till Tuesday, it was south of its normal position, but made a transition on Wednesday. At the same time, moisture was being fed from both Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, converging over Delhi from two different directions to create a charged area,” an IMD official said. The IMD forecast a reduction in rain intensity, but said light to moderate showers are likely on Friday. Mahesh Palawat, vice president at Skymet, a private weather forecaster, said the monsoon trough was moving away again, but there was still a possibility of light to moderate rain till Friday night. “The intensity will not be like we saw on Wednesday. It will mostly be light rain with some isolated parts recording moderate showers,” he said.

    "text": "[Heatwave warnings](https://7news.com.au/weather) have been issued for four Australian states, with millions of people set to swelter on [Australia Day](https://7news.com.au/news/australia-day). Large parts of central and eastern Australia are in for another day of heat after widespread temperatures above 40C on Thursday, with some inland areas nudging 50C. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Aussies in four states set to swelter on Australia day as heatwave warnings issued Watch the latest news and stream for free on [7plus >>](https://7plus.com.au/news?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link&utm_campaign=news-articles) Some areas in Sydney are set to climb to 40C by lunchtime while further north, the NSW coast is set to get a little warmer still with Newcastle and Taree both forecast for 41C while Grafton and Gosford will hit 40C. Temperatures in towns across the Hunter including Cessnock, Scone and Singleton will also rise by 1-2C on Thursday’s temperatures with Singleton expecting a peak of 43C and Scone 41C. The lower and upper west of the state will again bear the brunt of the heat with Bourke to hit 44C and Moree 42C. Residents across parts of the state could see a thunderstorm roll through in the afternoon and evening. NSW Health has warned residents to drink plenty of water and stay as cool as possible. “Avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and if you have to go outside, stay hydrated and wear sun protection,” it said. Inland areas of southern Australia’s north and southwest Queensland are also set to be warm, but markedly less so than Thursday, when temperatures sat in the mid to high 40s. South Australia will be noticeably cooler, with temperatures dropping about 10C and Adelaide forecasting a 24C maximum. A severe heatwave warning, however, still remains in Flinders, North West Pastoral and North East Pastoral Districts. Heatwave conditions for parts of Queensland’s west and interior are set to continue, though most regions will experience a welcome drop in temperature. Brisbane is forecast to peak at 33C and the Gold Coast 35C. A severe heat warning has been issued for the Simpson District in the NT, while Alice Springs, Borroloola and Tennant Creek are expected to reach maximum temperatures in the high 30s. Darwin is forecast to reach a maximum of 29C on Australia Day, with a 100 per cent chance of rain. Parts of the state are also on flood watch due to ex-cyclone Kirrily which is expected to make its approach over the weekend. In good news, cooler air spreading across the southern and eastern states will lead to temperatures noticeably dropping by Friday late afternoon. The forecast change will bring cooler weather for almost all areas on the weekend. - With AAP Stream Free on",

    "text": "Ayodhya’s modern ‘tent cities’ outshine luxury hotels; devotees to taste traditional dishes\nIn anticipation of the rising influx of global tourists ahead of the consecration programme of Lord Ram’s idol at the grand Ram Temple on January 22, the Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA) is actively working on setting up modern ‘tent cities’, aligning with the vision of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.\nThese tent cities of ADA offer luxury and semi-luxury suites designed for double occupancy, providing devotees with an opportunity to immerse themselves in the harmonious blend of mythological as well as modern Ayodhya amidst the serenity of nature.\nTent cities are becoming a medium to stay in ‘new grand Ayodhya’ for thousands of devotees.\nThe time for the consecration ceremony of Lord Ram’s idol at the grand Ram Temple is gradually approaching. It is expected that lakhs of devotees from all over the country and the world will flock to Ayodhya for the consecration ceremony.\nIn view of this and as per the wish of Chief Minister Adityanath, tent cities have been developed at various places by Shri Ram Mandir Teerth Kshetra Trust and Ayodhya Development Authority , officials said here on Thursday.\nA tent city is being established on 20-acre land at Majha Guptar Ghat to accommodate thousands of devotees. Another is being set up near Brahma Kund with 35 tents. Additionally, a tent city with 30 tents is being set up at Ram Katha Park.\nFurthermore, a 25-acre tent city is being established at Bag Bijaisi by the Tirth Kshetra Trust, providing accommodation for thousands of people. In addition to these, tent cities are also being set up in Karsewakpuram and Sri Maniram Das Chavni for the convenience of devotees.\nIn these tent cities that give the feel of ‘Heritage Cottage Stay’, devotees will get to taste all the flavours of the country, but the most distinctive ones will be the Awadhi and Banarasi flavours. The ADA has developed the tent city in Brahma Kund and Ram Katha Park through private partnership.\nThe tent city at Brahma Kund has been operational since December 1. Devotees staying here will be served millet dishes, ‘makki ki roti, sarson ka saag’ and seasonal vegetables.\nAdditionally, a variety of local dishes, including ‘Bajra Roti’ and other recipes,’Matar Ka Nimona’, ‘Bati-Chokha’ and ‘Moong Khichdi’ will also be served. Health-conscious people will also get the facility of detox water.\nPeople staying in the wooden deck-based tents will have all the facilities, including comfortable chairs, sofas, dining lounges, personal vaults, room heaters, air conditioning, high-speed internet, and luxurious interiors. Here, people will also have the convenience of a bonfire, an open-air theatre for cultural events, and a souvenir shop. These tents are durability-based and can be used for upto 10 years after installation.",
