    "text": "2023 in review: The best of Avi Yemini\nFrom book launches to international tours, from confronting world leaders to reporting from the front lines of war, a recap of Rebel reporter Avi Yemini's standout moments this year.\nWhat a remarkable year 2023 has been! Among its many highlights was the launch of my book,\nA Rebel From The Start, in New Zealand. Despite the government's initial attempts to bar my entry, the overturned unlawful ban allowed me to enter the country and officially launch the book.\nIt was the perfect place to launch, with PM Jacinda Ardern so wildly unpopular due to her incredible COVID tyranny, she had to step down. That was a shame for her because I had reserved a special signed copy for her, too!\nThe journey didn't stop there. An international book tour saw us traverse Melbourne, Israel, and London, where I had the pleasure of meeting so many of you!\nSpeaking of Melbourne, my hometown witnessed the departure of another lockdown bully, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews. The spectacle of Melbourne's jubilant streets on his final day was something to behold.\nCan you imagine being such an awful leader that on your last day in the office, the streets erupt into a giant street party to celebrate your departure?\nGood Weekend magazine ran a feature on me, which triggered all of the right people, and so did my\nincredibly popular interview with veteran broadcaster Neil Mitchell.\nStanding with me through many pivotal moments was my mate Rukshan Fernando, who I had met at Melbourne's anti-lockdown protests. Together, we started\nThe Opposition Podcast, challenging mainstream narratives. This venture welcomed guests like Kamahl, Sam Newman, several politicians, and even my dad!\nThroughout the year, Benji, my cameraman, was by my side, and was fearless during our\nreporting stint in Israel from the front lines the conflict between the IDF and Hamas terrorists after the shocking events on October 7.\nThe tide started to turn on\nAustralia's Voice to Parliament referendum proposal not long after we decided to do what no other media outlet wanted to show you and reported on what was going on in Alice Springs, at the heart of the real isues faced by the nation's indigenous people.\nOn the global stage, I joined my fellow Rebels at the\nWorld Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Direct confrontations with elite figures went viral online and at London's ARC conference my exclusive interviews, including those with former Australian PM Scott Morrison and former NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet, resonated widely back home.\nThe year presented its share of highs, lows, and intense moments. Yet, through it all, my dedication to our shared mission never wavered, bolstered by the unwavering support from all of you.\nIn closing, whether you celebrated a joyous Christmas, Hanukkah, or both like me, I extend my heartfelt gratitude.\nHere's to an even bigger 2024!\n[]https://rebelstore.com.au/\nREBEL STORE AUSTRALIA\nGet Rebel News Australia merchandise!

    "text": "Mango lovers are in for some disappointment. The king of fruits is likely to make a late entry this year. Additionally, the production is predicted to be lower because of the flowering pattern this year. According to experts, despite there being full flowering on the trees, the fruiting will be much less.\nExplaining the reason for lower crop production, Vijaysinh Barot, horticulture officer, Centre of Excellence for Agriculture, Talala, says, “During the flowering period between December 15 and January 15, temperature should be around 25 degrees Celsius during the day and 15+ degrees at night.\nHowever, this year the temperature in regions where Kesar mangoes grow was lower than required. As a result, the ratio between the male and the female flowers on the trees has been disturbed and there has been more male flowering.” Since it is the female flowers that bear fruit, the final production will be quite less, he explains.\n10-15% rise in prices\nDue to lower production, mangoes are expected to be costlier when they hit the market. Ramesh Siroya, secretary of Talala Marketing Yard, says, “This will be the second consecutive bad season for Kesar mangoes. Last year, we received 5.5 lakh boxes (of 10 kg each) of mangoes at the marketing yard for selling. This year doesn’t look any better. In 2023, we had sold 11 lakh boxes. The bad crop of mangoes is thanks to the weather.” He expects 10-15% price rise due to higher demand, pointing out that the main mango season will be in May.\nAhmedabad-based entrepreneur Dhara Kapadia who sells high-quality mangoes to premium clientele, says, “This year, season will be delayed by two to three weeks. It is expected to start from the first or second week of April. There might be a minor rise in prices, but retailers like us may try to absorb the hike partially at their end.”\nGirish Bhimani, who has over 100 trees of Kesar mangoes in his farm in Junagadh’s Vanthali, predicts prices to start at Rs 1,500 for a 10-kg box initially and then lower down to Rs 1,000–1,200 for a while before stabilising at Rs 700–800 later during the peak season.\nWeather not the only factor\nThe impact of external factors is visible on the fruit. “Apart from the weather, polluted groundwater in our region is also spoiling the crop. The Uben river that passes through Jetpur receives a lot of chemical waste. Due to this, groundwater is polluted up to 5 km on both sides of the passing river,” says Bhimani.\nHowever, Not all are unhappy with the crop this year. Bhuj-based Haresh Thakkar who has done mango farming over 80 acres of land, is optimistic about the availability of mangoes. “Areas like Bhachau and Mandvi have had good mango flowering,” he says, adding, “However, the full picture will be clear by March 20. Retail prices of mangoes are expected to start at Rs 300–400 per kg and slowly come down to around Rs 70–80.” Traditionally, mangoes from Bhuj arrive later than others in the market.\n Areas like Bhachau, Mandvi have had good mango flowering... However, the full picture will be clear by March 20. Retail prices of mangoes are expected to start at Rs 300–400 per kg and slowly come down toaround Rs 70–80 –Haresh Thakkar",

    "text": "With 39 points (20 in the first quarter alone),\nLuka Doncic put on another show on Wednesday, but it wasn’t enough as the Dallas Mavericks lost 113-110 at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, and Evan Mobley were all out of the Cavaliers’ lineup, and Kyrie Irving was still not in the Mavs’. Shannon Sharpe and Gill Arena showed their frustration at the Dallas Mavericks’ defeat.\nAdditionally, the Mavs led by as many as 20 points in the second quarter before getting halftime leads of 15 points and fourth-quarter leads of up to 10 points. The Dallas Mavericks let a 20-point lead slip away at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were without injured players like Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, and Darius Garland. Former NFL player and current sports analyst\nShannon Sharpe expressed his disappointment.\nShannon Sharpe said via NightCap,\nCavs were without three starters, You Can't lose that game on your home court especially up by 20 points. A 20-point lead in today's game is not the same as 20 20-point lead twenty years ago\"\nJarett Allen and Caris LeVert came up and performed well despite the Cavaliers’ injuries, helping the team pull off a victory.\nSharpe’s response to the game was not unusual. The Mavericks’ collapse surprised and disappointed a lot of fans and analysts. The loss especially disappointed fans of the Mavericks because their team had been playing well lately and had high expectations for the upcoming campaign.\nLuka Doncic’s burning response to being booed by the ‘hostile’ Phoenix crowd goes viral: “Best feeling in the world”\nLuka Doncic is having a wonderful season for the Dallas Mavericks\nDoncic came into Wednesday having played twelve straight games with an average of 37.6 points, 11.4 assists, and 9.2 rebounds, which included\n a fifty-point performance against the Phoenix Suns on Christmas Day. He kept up that furious pace and appears headed for his fifth consecutive selection to the All-NBA First Team. Even after the Dallas Mavericks’ defeat by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Luka Doncic is still the league’s best player in December and the entire campaign. https://www.nba.com/player/1629029/luka-doncic is among the front-runners for the NBA MVP award this season thanks to his outstanding performances. The Slovenian International is currently averaging 33 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists per game. The Mavericks have moved up two spots in the NBA power rankings thanks to Doncic’s dominance. His ability to create plays and score has been essential to the Mavericks’ success this year. With an 18-13 record, the Mavericks are ready to cause a stir in the Western Conference.\nThis season, the Mavericks hope to make the playoffs, and Doncic’s continuous dominance will be essential to that goal. The player has demonstrated his capacity to take control of games and improve his teammates. If the Mavericks want to go far in the playoffs this year, Doncic’s outstanding play must continue.\nIn case you missed it:\nPaul Pierce claims the Lakers hung up the ‘in-season championship banner’ just to ‘spite’ the Celtics “This sht is a*!” – Zion Williamson gets BRUTALLY trolled for seemingly uncentered chest tattoo flexing a ‘lion in a cross’\n- Do follow us on:\n- Follow FirstSportz on\nWhatsApp Channel",

    "text": "Israel Defies Global Calls for Ceasefire Amid Heightened Regional Tensions Israel has rejected global calls for a ceasefire with Hezbollah, continuing strikes in Lebanon and raising fears of regional conflict. The U.S. and France pursue a 21-day truce proposal. Israeli attacks have intensified, resulting in significant casualties. Lebanese civilians and Hezbollah targets have been heavily affected. Israel has dismissed international appeals for a ceasefire with Hezbollah, opting instead to continue its airstrikes in Lebanon, which have resulted in hundreds of casualties. This move defies its chief ally, the United States, and has escalated fears of a broader regional conflict. While Israel remains adamant, the U.S. and France are pushing for a 21-day truce, with ongoing negotiations happening alongside the United Nations meeting in New York. Recent Israeli strikes have targeted the outskirts of Beirut, killing several and injuring many, including high-profile Hezbollah leaders. On the ground, the Israeli army is preparing for a potential invasion, a significant uptick in an already brutal campaign. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue military action until all objectives are met, despite international pressure for a ceasefire.

    "text": "AUBURN — With temperatures warming up over the next few days, Cal Fire is urging people to stay out of the rivers.\nThe warning comes as search efforts continue for a missing kayaker who flipped into the American River in Auburn. Cal Fire said it's situations like this that they want to avoid this spring.\nHeading into Mother's Day Weekend, the American River is running fast and cold. Those conditions will continue for the next few months.\nThat's something Patrick Krivens understands. Visiting from the Bay Area, he was in Auburn hoping for a quiet day of fly fishing.\n\"The water is really high, so it can be pretty unsafe,\" Krivens said. \"So I'm going to mostly be on the rocks. On the side, might go in just a little bit.\"\nJust yards from where Krivens planned to set up, search efforts continued Wednesday for that missing kayaker. Last Friday, two people flipped over in their kayak just north of the No Hands Bridge. Only one made it to shore.\nChief Nick Salas leads one of Cal Fire's Technical Rescue teams. With temperatures forecast in the mid-80s Friday and Saturday, he knows some people will be tempted to cool off in the water.\n\"We can't keep people from getting in the river,\" he said. \"The only thing we can do is try and educate them and try to make it very clear that if you get in, you're taking a huge risk.\"\nSalas says the two kayakers had life jackets but weren't wearing them.\nNow, what started as a rescue is now a recovery mission. But with the river flowing too strongly, divers can't go in safely.\nSalas says it's this kind of tragedy that he hopes serves as a wake-up call for how dangerous it can be.\n\"It's extremely cold, and even if you consider yourself a good swimmer, if you swallow any amount of water or if you get into any of these helical flows behind us, it will take you out,\" he said.\nIn:",

    "text": "„Das tut weh“: Beliebter Club in NRW schließt nach 30 Jahren\nEin weiterer Club in NRW schließt nach 30 Jahren endgültig. Eigentlich hatten die Betreiber Erweiterungspläne. Nun sprechen sie über die Gründe.\nWuppertal - In vielen Städten in Nordrhein-Westfalen kämpfen Clubs und Kneipen um ihre Existenzen. Oftmals spielen Nachwirkungen der Corona-Pandemie hier eine Rolle. Aber auch das Ausgehverhalten der Menschen hat sich über die Jahre verändert. Nun trifft es auch einen etablierten Club in Wuppertal, der besonders für seine Reggae-Konzerte bekannt ist.\n„Musik, Community & Clubkultur verlieren ihr Zuhause. Nach über 30 Jahren Clubkultur in Wuppertal haben wir die schwerste Entscheidung unserer Geschichte getroffen“, heißt es auf der Website des U-Clubs in Wuppertal. Der beliebte Club an der Friedrich-Ebert-Straße 191 wird zum Ende des Jahres schließen. Bereits 30 Jahre gab es die Diskothek in der Stadt im Bergischen Land.\n„Schwerste Entscheidung unserer Geschichte“: Club schließt nach 30 Jahren\nÜber die Jahre haben die Betreiber immer wieder frische Konzepte und Ideen eingebracht, um den U-Club zu halten. Zuletzt sei in den Club noch ordentlich investiert worden, unter anderem in neue, moderne Licht und Tontechnik. Doch der Wandel der Zeit lasse sich nicht aufhalten, heißt es.\nDie Betreiber seien an harte, unüberwindbare Grenzen gestoßen. Es sei im Sinne der Club-Betreiber gewesen, einen bewirtschafteten Außenbereich zu schaffen und unter anderem diesen zum Wupperufer zugänglich zu machen. Darüber hinaus hatten die Betreiber den Wunsch, den Club in zwei unabhängige Bereiche aufzuteilen. Damit hätte man kleinere Veranstaltungen parallel laufen lassen können, heißt es zu den Plänen. „Doch diese Ideen sind an diesem Standort nicht umsetzbar“, teilen die Betreiber mit.\nClub-Betreiber haben noch einige Pläne vor endgültiger Schließung\n„Der U-Club ist nicht mehr zeitgemäß betreibbar – und wirtschaftlich nicht tragbar. Das tut weh. Richtig weh“, heißt es weiter in der Schließungsankündigung auf der Club-Website. Doch bevor es so weit ist und die Türen der Diskothek am 31. Dezember zum letzten Mal öffnen, haben die Betreiber noch einige Pläne. Ab dem 1. August möchte der Club das Abschiedsprogramm veröffentlichen und im September die beliebten Veranstaltungsreihen zurückholen.\n„Wir sagen Danke. Für all die Nächte, die ihr mit Leben gefüllt habt. Für jede Erinnerung, die hier entstanden ist“, schreiben die Betreiber. In dem Video zur Schließung, das auf dem Instagram-Account des U-Clubs gepostet wurde, verkünden viele Menschen ihre Trauer über die Schließung.\nSo schreibt Rapperin Nura: „Danke für die geilsten Jahre meiner Jugend. U Club bleibt Legende“. „Es ist so bitter! Seit 18 Jahren mein Lieblingsclub.. so viele Leute kennengelernt, geile Konzerte besucht, unzählige Partys gefeiert, so viel gelacht und noch viel mehr getanzt“, kommentiert eine weitere Nutzerin.\nEin Club in Bochum verabschiedet sich derweil wohl doch nicht endgültig. Neue Termine wecken Hoffnung. Indessen bleibt die Zukunft vage.",
