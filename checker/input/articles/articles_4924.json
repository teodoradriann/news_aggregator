    "text": "[U.S. News](../) Boeing West Coast factory workers going on strike after 96% vote for walkout Boeing’s US West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96% voted on Thursday in favor of a strike, halting production of the planemaker’s strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt. The workers’ first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time on Friday. This comes just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel [blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air](//nypost.com/2024/09/12/us-news/alaska-airlines-pilot-emily-wiprud-had-no-clue-boein-737-max-9-door-plug-blew-off/) in January. Roughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing’s 737 MAX, and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas were voting on their first full contract in 16 years. Under complicated rules set by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), at least two-thirds of the unionized workers had to vote in favor of a strike for a stoppage to begin and the contract to be rejected. Boeing workers voted 96% in favor of striking and 94.6% to reject the agreement. The deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing’s next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program is launched within the four years of the contract. Although IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus. On Wednesday, Ortberg sent a letter to workers, urging them to approve the deal. Some workers were already preparing for picket lines that day, with one union member leaving a Wednesday meeting carrying a placard under her arm that read: “On Strike Against Boeing.” [World News](/)|| [Latest News](/news)|| [U.S. News](../../us-news) [Source link](//nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/boeing-workers-going-on-strike-after-96-vote-for-walkout/)",

    "text": "The Islamabad District and Sessions Court judge went to his chambers without ruling on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founders Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi ‘s appeals against their convictions in the Iddat marriage case. The reserved judgment on the appeals against the sentence in the Iddat Nikah case is expected to be delivered today.\nIt should be noted that on May 23, 2024, the court had reserved its decision on the appeals of PTI founder and Bushra Bibi in the Iddat marriage case after arguments by lawyers on both sides.\nAt the start of the hearing, Khawar Manika ‘s lawyer Rizwan Abbasi was again absent. On Justice Shahrukh Arjamand’s request, the assistant lawyer said he was in the Supreme Court. The judge granted time to Rizwan Abbasi to appear in court.\nSessions Judge Shahrukh Arjamand heard the appeals of PTI founder and Bushra Bibi, during which Bushra Bibi’s lawyer Usman Gul and complainant Khawar’s lawyer Manika Rizwan Abbasi appeared as legal assistant.\nThe complainant’s legal assistant had told the court that Rizwan Abbasi had to give his arguments, the record was not with him.\nIt may be recalled that on February 3, 2024, Senior Civil Judge Qudratullah issued a short verdict in the IDT matrimonial case and sentenced PTI founders and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in prison. The court also imposed a fine of five lakh rupees on PTI founder and Bushra Bibi.\nIt should be noted that Bushra Bibi’s ex-husband Khawar Manika appeared before the court of Civil Judge Qudrat in Islamabad on November 25 and filed a case against Imran Khan and his wife for Idda marriage and illicit relations, petition section 494. / 34 , filed under B-496 and other provisions.\nIn the petition it was stated that I belong to Manika family of Pakpattan, I was married to Bushra Bibi in 1989 which was good and smooth until Imran Khan moved to Islamabad through Bushra Bibi’s sister in law did not intervene during the sit-in wedding, the applicant, who resides in the United Arab Emirates and believes he has strong ties to the Jewish lobby.\nKhawar Manika had stated that the PTI president had entered the house of the complainant in the guise of Pari Muridi and started visiting the house frequently even in his absence\nThe petition further stated that as time passed, Imran Khan had started meddling in their marital life, despite being warned and even kicked out of the house inappropriately.\nKhawar Manika had told in the application that one day when she suddenly went to her house, she saw that Zulfi Bukhari was alone in her bedroom, she also often came with Imran Khan.\nIn the application he had stated that Bushra Bibi had started going to Bani Gala without my permission, even though I had tried to stop him by force, and there were also harsh sentences.\nIt was further written that Bushra Bibi was in possession of various mobile phones and SIM cards, which were given to him by Farah Gogi on the instructions of the PTI Chairman.\nKhawar Manika has stated in the petition that before the so-called marriage both of them had illicit relations with each other, a fact which employee Latif told me.\nThe petition further stated that efforts had been made to improve the situation for the good of the family but all had failed and the complainant had filed for divorce on November 14, 2017.\nAccording to Khawar Manika’s request, Bushra Bibi got married to Imran Khan on 1 January 2018 during Eid-ul-Fitr, this marriage is illegal and against Islamic teachings.\nIt was further written that after the fact of marriage during Iddat came to light, both of them got remarried in February 2018 through Mufti Saeed, so it is a serious crime under section 496/496B of Pakistan Penal Code, both of them were eloped before marriage.\nThe petition demanded that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi be summoned and punished severely according to the constitution and law.\nOn December 11, the Islamabad local court declared the illegal marriage case filed by Khawar Manika against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi admissible.\n#judge #left #ruling #appeals #sentences",

    "text": "HALIFAX, NS , Feb. 15, 2024 /CNW/ - EverWind Fuels (\"EverWind\"), a pioneering developer of an Atlantic Canadian green fuels hub based across Nova Scotia & Newfoundland & Labrador, today announced the release of EverWind's Economic Impact Assessment on its Nova Scotia based green hydrogen and ammonia project (\"Nova Scotia Project\").\nThe Economic Impact Assessment, which was supported by Deloitte Canada , found significant economic and environmental benefits from EverWind's Nova Scotia Project, including the full green energy production cycle from renewable power generation (wind & solar) to green hydrogen-to-ammonia production.\nEconomic contribution that will arise during the construction period for Phase 1 of EverWind's Nova Scotia Project were estimated to be:\nOver $2.3 billion in Canadian GDP, with approximately half accruing to Nova Scotia Over 11,000 FTEs in Canada , with approximately half accruing to Nova Scotia Approximately $568 million in Government revenue, with approximately half accruing to Nova Scotia Economic contribution during operations (post-construction) for Phase 1 of EverWind's Nova Scotia Project were estimated to be:\nOver $340 million /year contribution in Canadian GDP, with the vast majority accruing to Nova Scotia Approximately 900 FTEs1, in Canada , with the vast majority accruing to Nova Scotia Approximately $37 million /year in Government revenue, with the vast majority accruing to Nova Scotia The EIA highlighted the following structural benefits:\nCommunity and First Nations Benefits – EverWind's Mi'kmaq equity partnerships will enable sustainable business growth, employment, and training opportunities for local First Nations. The Nova Scotia Project will reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 1.91 to 2.33 million tonnes each year (the approximate equivalent of taking 3 out of every 4 cars in Nova Scotia off the road). Energy Supply and Balancing for the Grid – The Nova Scotia Project is poised to deliver annual benefits of over $30 million to Nova Scotia's grid through load following, and ancillary grid services, and tariff payments. International Trade for Green Hydrogen – Point Tupper is considered to be an ideal location for green hydrogen and green ammonia exports to the largest global demand markets Capacity Development and Innovation – The Nova Scotia Project will enhance Canada's green energy innovation, while supporting Nova Scotia's labour market. The study finds that the first phase of production may break the chicken-and-egg problem of hydrogen supply and demand and establishes further phases of growth and sustainability of project operations. Future phases of the project, which include additional onshore and offshore wind development, are set up to generate further economic benefits to Canada and Nova Scotia .\nAdditional Resources: Deloitte Economic Impact Assessment Infographic Deloitte Economic Impact Assessment Full Report\nRecognition of the Mi'kmaw & their Ancestral Territory EverWind acknowledges the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq people, and we acknowledge them as the past, present, and future caretakers of this land, Mi'kma'ki.

    "title": "Hamas sends delegation to Gaza peace talks in sign of progress",
    "text": "Hamas said that it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further ceasefire talks, in a new sign of progress in attempts by international mediators to hammer out an agreement between Israel and the militant group to end the\nwar in Gaza.\nAfter months of stop-and-start negotiations, the cease-fire efforts appear to have reached a critical stage, with Egyptian and American mediators reporting signs of compromise in recent days. But chances for the deal remain entangled with the key question of whether Israel will accept an end to the war without reaching its stated goal of destroying Hamas.\nThe stakes in the cease-fire negotiations were made clear in a new UN report that said if the Israel-Hamas war stops today, it will still take until 2040 to rebuild all the homes that have been destroyed by nearly seven months of Israeli bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza.\nIt warned that the impact of the damage to the economy will set back development for generations and will only get worse with every month fighting continues.\nThe proposal that US and Egyptian mediators have put to Hamas -– apparently with Israel's acceptance — sets out a three-stage process that would bring an immediate six-week cease-fire and partial release of Israeli hostages, but also negotiations over a \"permanent calm\" that includes some sort of Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, according to an Egyptian official. Hamas is seeking guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal and complete end to the war.\nHamas officials have sent mixed signals about the proposal in recent days. But on Thursday, its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said in a statement that he had spoken to Egypt's intelligence chief and \"stressed the positive spirit of the movement in studying the cease-fire proposal.\"\nThe statement said that Hamas negotiators would travel to Cairo \"to complete the ongoing discussions with the aim of working forward for an agreement.\" Haniyeh said he had also spoken to the prime minister of Qatar, another key mediator in the process.\nThe brokers are hopeful that the deal will bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, caused widespread destruction and plunged the territory into a humanitarian crisis.\nThey also hope a deal will avert an Israeli attack on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people have sought shelter after fleeing battle zones elsewhere in the territory.\nIf Israel does agree to end the war in return for a full hostage release, it would be a major turnaround. Since Hamas' October 7 attack stunned Israel, its leaders have vowed not to stop their bombardment and ground offensives until the militant group is destroyed. They also say Israel must keep a military presence in Gaza and security control after the war to ensure Hamas doesn't rebuild.\nPolice move into camp as US anti-war protests continue\nIn other news, Turkey is ratcheting up its condemnation of Israel's war on Gaza, reportedly upgrading trade restrictions it had previously set to a full embargo on imports and exports, reports Bloomberg/\nThe move comes shortly after a tweet from Israel's foreign minister accusing Turkey of breaking trade agreements, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as a dictator.",
