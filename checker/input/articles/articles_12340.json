    "title": "After pizza, TapBlaze launches Good Coffee, Great Coffee on mobile | VentureBeat",
    "text": "TapBlaze , the maker of Good Pizza, Great Pizza , has branched out with the launch of Good Coffee, Great Coffee on mobile devices. It launches today on iOS and Android.\nThe game is a free-to-play title where players can buy cosmetics with real money. You may eventually be able to customize your shop and equipment.\nAfter all a whole decade refining the pizza game, it’s about time for TapBlaze to try something new. But the company was patient. For the past five years, CEO Anthony Lai and a small team have been working on the coffee game in the same artistic universe as Good Pizza, Great Pizza.\nGood Coffee, Great Coffee is in the same universe as Good Pizza, Great Pizza. It sounds like an awesome game in the tradition of Good Pizza, Great Pizza, which has been downloaded more than 300 million times across the globe and it is played daily by over a million players.\nLos Angeles-based TapBlaze has been cooking up its latest story-rich cooking business simulator with the coffee expertise of Lai, who gets a lot of joy out of making coffee and latte art. In the game, you experience the art and hustle of running your own coffee shop.\n“Pizza is something I grew up with. And then my other obsession in terms of food has been coffee for the last decade at least,” he said. “I used to go to all the coffee shops in LA, you know, and I will observe and how people shop. And I even have my own set up at home. I practiced latte art for like five, six years.”\nLai thinks of making cool latte foam images the same way he thinks about putting ingredients on top of a pizza.\n“It’s like an art,” he said.\nYou can do your own latte art in Good Coffee, Great Coffee. The game hand-drawn 2D art with soft pastel colors, capturing the warm, inviting feel of a local mom-and-pop café. Mary Le created a narrative to go with the game.\nYuni Cho, marketing manager, “The idea of personalization is very big in the game, where you can decorate, make your drinks and have avatars where you can decorate yourself.”\nYou brew success by mastering intricate orders, refining your equipment, and experimenting with bold new ingredients—all while competing against rival Brewists in a city fueled by caffeine. With a perfect blend of time management and puzzle-solving mechanics, this game serves up a robust narrative, a cast of quirky characters, and a satisfying shot of strategy and creativity.\n“Good pizza, Great pizza was at a pretty good stage in terms of business side,” Lai said. “The process of doing content updates and live events is still a lot of work. But it’s not like four or five years ago” where the studio was still finding its way.\nGood Coffee, Great Coffee has realistic coffee making. “We were just throwing stuff at the wall,” he said. “Now we have a kind of formula and the feedback from players is good. I thought it was a good time. I wanted an internal challenge. And as a company, we are at the stage where it’s financially possible to do this.”\nStarting in 2020, Lai worked with one other team member on the game. Then they brought in part of the larger team, but many of the employees continued to work on Good Pizza, Great Pizza. Lai was risk averse, so he didn’t really create two different teams. All told, the team has just 13 people.\nWhen the team came up with the first design for a shop, the milk steamer was a separate machine and it was on the far side of the shop from the coffee machine. Lai had to quickly have them fix that.\nAfter years of asking for a new game, players are finally getting what they want. They can craft delicious drinks, experiment with unique flavors, decorate your café, and master the art of coffee-making to become the best Brewist in town. ☕✨\nGood Pizza, Great Pizza is still a global hit with 1.3 million daily players, and top-charting success worldwide (No. 1 in China, Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Egypt, and top charts in the U.S.).\nYou can customize your ingredients in Good Coffee, Great Coffee. Players can customize their café with a wide range of adorable decorations and create aesthetic coffee drinks using 14 different toppings. Test your barista skills and impress the judges with your unique creations. It’s a cozy game with endless customization, and relaxing yet engaging gameplay.\nAs you rise to become a Master Brewist, you’ll also get to know and befriend neighborhood locals through the Side Stories feature. Complete these quests to earn rewards and strengthen your connections, all while balancing friendly competition and café growth. After a while, you can test how fast you can make coffee as the shop gets more and more crowded.\nDuring each game day, the number of customers depends on how efficiently players complete orders. Story-driven players may have fewer customers, while those focused on the restaurant sim aspect can serve more orders for higher profits.\nPlayers earn funds to upgrade equipment, buy decorations, and unlock new ingredients. By visiting the Cafe Tab daily, they can explore interactive Quests, Achievements, and the Side Stories app. Serving drinks with the perfect balance of coffee grounds and espresso shots results in cost-efficient profits, as improperly made drinks waste ingredients at a higher flat rate.\nAs far as the competition goes, Lai saw an opening for a more realistic title.\n“We didn’t really see any sim games that had a very realistic coffee experience. I think they’re very simplified versions,” he said. “And I thought, ‘Oh, this is something we can take advantage of and really show them like this new mechanic.'”\nGood Coffee, Great Coffee was made by TapBlaze with a small team in LA. The fan community offered the idea in the first place and it has been expecting the title for a while. The fans went crazy when the company released its first trailer. The game has been in open beta for six or so months, starting in the Philippines and other places in Asia.\nAs for marketing, the company will be conservative about spending and will shoot for organic growth, Cho said. There are a lot of VTubers who have played the game recently and South Koreans in particular lvoe their coffee, Cho said. There’s also some hope that Apple will feature the game.\n“Paid user acquisition is never a main focus, but it’s starting to become part of our business strategy in terms of marketing,” Lai said.",

    "title": "Expert Warns of Increased Blood Clot Risk in Cold Weather: How to Minimize the Danger",
    "text": "Blood clotting is a way to prevent bleeding in cases of wounds, and although this response is beneficial for our\nhealth, in some cases clots can be life-threatening.\nWhen jelly-like lumps appear in veins and arteries without cause, they can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. What is worrying is that outside temperature could play a role in this process, according to one expert.\nSudden changes in temperature, such as when people enter a warm building after being outside in the cold, can cause heat stress to the body. This can make your body work harder to maintain a constant temperature. The viscosity of the blood can also be affected, making it more viscous and more likely to clot, according to Professor Mark Whitley, consultant vein surgeon and founder of the Whitley Clinic.\nProfessor Whiteley explained that the risk of heart attacks can increase in cold\nweather, saying: “This may be due to increased clotting in the coronary arteries, but it could also be due to increased resistance to pumping blood around the body in cold weather when all the arteries narrow to reduce heat loss.” From the skin, which makes the heart work harder. Therefore, it has not been proven that this is definitely due to blood clotting. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a significant difference between people with coronary heart disease who exercise in normal weather or cold weather, which indicates “Moderate exercise in cold weather is not at all dangerous and may be beneficial.”\nThe expert added that cold\nweather is also linked to an increased risk of a different type of blood clot, which is pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to an artery in the lung and stops it. However, Professor Whitley added that deep vein thrombosis, which is blood clots in the deep veins, is more likely to occur as temperatures drop.\nResearch published in the journal\nInternational Angiology also warns that low temperatures appear to be “significantly associated” with deep vein thrombosis. The study looked at patients who were hospitalized with deep vein thrombosis in Shenyang, China, over a ten-year period.\nThe results showed that lower ambient temperatures were associated with symptoms of DVT, with the effects of the cold sometimes delayed by up to one week.\nFortunately, Professor Whitley explained how to keep the risk of clotting in the colder months to a minimum, saying: “It is clearly sensible to stay warm if possible. Smoking should be avoided because nicotine causes arterial spasm and increases proteins which can increase the risk of blood clotting. “In the long run, smoking also damages blood vessel walls by causing inflammation. Exercise is always beneficial because good blood flow through the blood vessels keeps the blood vessel wall healthy and reduces the risk of any blood clots inside the vessel.”\n2023-12-28 05:29:52\n#factor #increases #risk #blood #clots",

    "title": "‘Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel’: Palestinian president",
    "text": "LONDON: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday urged the international community to stop sending weapons to Israel in order to end the war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank.\n“Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel,” he told the UN General Assembly.\n“This madness can’t continue. The entire world is responsible for what’s happening to our people in Gaza and the West Bank.”\nAbbas’s comments come after the Health Ministry in Gaza on Thursday said at least 41,534 people have been killed in the war, now in its 12th month.\nHe said the Israeli government took advantage of the Hamas attack last October to launch an all-out genocide against Gaza.\n“It committed and continues to commit war crimes, as acknowledged by the international community,” Abbas added.\nHe said Israel is now launching “a new aggression on the Lebanese people,” who are being “subjected to a war of genocide.”\nHe added: “Israel must stop the war in Lebanon and in Palestine. We condemn this aggression, and we demand that it stops immediately.\n“Israel has reoccupied the Gaza Strip in its entirety … Seventy-five percent of everything in Gaza has been fully destroyed.”\nMore than 600 people have been killed since Monday in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, which follow nearly a year of cross-border fire with Hezbollah in parallel with the Gaza war.\nAbbas called on the international community to impose sanctions on Israel, and said the country does not deserve to be a UN member.\n“The international community must immediately impose sanctions on Israel. The massacres, the crimes, the genocide that Israel has been perpetrating against our people since its inception in 1948 to this very day won’t go unpunished,” he said.\n“Israel, which refuses to implement UN resolutions, doesn’t deserve to be a member in this international organization.”\nAbbas called for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, an end to attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Gaza, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory.\n“We refuse the establishment of buffer zones or taking any part from Gaza,” he said. “We won’t allow a single centimeter of Gaza to be taken.\n“The State of Palestine must shoulder its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip and impose its full mandate on it and jurisdiction on it, including the border checkpoints, especially the Rafah international border.”\nHe said the Palestinian Authority should have control over all Palestinian territories, and it would hold elections once the war is over. Hamas has governed Gaza since 2007.\nAbbas concluded by saying: “Palestine will be free. It will be free, despite anyone who objects to that. Our people will live on the land of their fathers and grandfathers, as they’ve done for more than 6,000 years. They’ll continue their legitimate struggle for independence. The occupation will end.”",
