    "text": "With temps dropping across the Ozarks many choosing not to utilize warming centers SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Many people who could utilize homeless shelters choose to brave the elements independently. They have their reasons, but one thing remains the same: it’s dangerous in the cold. “It came down to a point where I actually had to drink to stay warm,” said Travis Seek, a homeless man living at the Victory Mission. Travis Seek has been in and out of poverty for decades. In August of 2022, he found himself homeless in Springfield. Despite his issues, he wouldn’t go to a shelter. “I would never would go into homeless shelters or anything of that nature,” said Seek. “Always was couch surfing and partying.” In December of 2022, that all changed. Cold weather came for the Ozarks with a vengeance, with wind-chills nearing -40 degrees. Seek says he saw many friends lose fingers and toes to the cold. “Frozen toes, frozen feet, frozen ear lobes,” said Seek. “Yeah, black just turned black. I’ve seen your lobes turn black. Lips turn black, blue, and black. Toes are missing. I have a friend who actually got four of his toes missing from the cold weather. (He’s) trying to stay in an abandoned house, trying to stay warm.” He says that stuck with him. So when he exited jail in December 2022, the cab they called brought him to Victory Mission. He’s been there ever since. He says pride was the main reason he didn’t want to utilize shelters or warming centers. “Pride and ego,” said Seek. “I always thought I was better than most people that come to a homeless shelter. I wasn’t able, you know, they got rules. And you know, kind of lived in a rebellious lifestyle where I didn’t accept rules. So I can you can’t drink here, you can’t do drugs. You can’t. You can’t bring women. Everything’s separated. You got rules to follow.” It’s an issue that many face. Mindy McDonald with Victory Mission says it’s a multi-faceted issue. Some don’t want to give up independence, and some don’t want to share living space. The main issues, though, are safety and drug use. I think the drug and alcohol policy is a huge element,” said McDonald. “And honestly, it really helps with the safety factor. But that can be a barrier for somebody who, you know, substance use and mental health often it’s a lot more nuanced than just being sober not being sober.” [CLICK HERE ](https://www.ky3.com/2023/12/18/see-list-cold-weather-shelters-ozarks/)for a list of cold weather shelters in Springfield and across Missouri.
