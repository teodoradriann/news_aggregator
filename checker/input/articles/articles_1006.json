    "text": "Here’s Jon Stewart’s Stunned Reaction to Trump’s Most Obvious Lie on ‘The Daily Show’\nFormer President\nDonald Trump's bold denial that he ever called for Hillary Clinton to be jailed left the host of The Daily Show Jon Stewart stunned. Trump's allegation over the weekend was so obviously untrue that following the playback of the video on his show, Stewart stood silent for a full fifteen seconds. Stewart's response when he eventually found his voice was simply priceless, per Uproxx.\n“What the f**k?” Stewart yelled, clearly frustrated, per\nDeadline. “I think I remember you saying it ― to her face, at a debate.” This sharp reference was to Trump's notorious 2016 presidential debate comment to Clinton when he said she would “you’d be in jail” if he won. Stewart then went on to critique Trump's insolence with his customary sharp wit.\nJon Stewart looks at the fallout from Trump's conviction and makes a plea to the media. Full piece here:— The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow)\n [pic.twitter.com/0bQERVqcmt] [June 4, 2024]\n“To be fair, I apologize, you did not say the words, ‘Lock her up,’” Stewart sarcastically corrected himself. “You only used a phrase synonymous with locking her up.” Stewart, though, wasn't done. “He literally said ‘lock her up’ all the fucking time,” Stewart continued, cutting to a montage of footage that had Trump repeating the same phrase—which he now claims he has never said—repeatedly.\nAfter watching the video, which served as a sharp reminder of Trump's constant demands to put his political rival in jail, Stewart's disbelief gave way to obvious annoyance. Stewart slammed his desk with his hands, and he froze for 15 seconds! As soon as Stewart snapped out, he blasted the Fox News anchors who had interviewed Trump for not standing up to his flagrant lies.\n🔥 JON STEWART: “This is why the ‘law & order’ right hates court procedures when applied to them… it is the last place you have to prove what you say. The media must stop letting them act like there are 2 realities and challenge them to their faces.”— The Tennessee Holler (@TheTNHoller)\n(cc: Tennessee media)\n[pic.twitter.com/81VeZIIPCV] [June 4, 2024]\n“And he said it a million times!” Stewart cried out, criticizing the hosts for not calling him out. Stewart took use of the occasion to draw attention to a crucial aspect of the American legal system. “And that, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, is why we need courts,” he explained. “Whatever flaws the American justice system has — and they are legion, especially for non-billionaire former presidents — it does appear to be the last place in America where you can’t just say whatever the f*** you want, regardless of reality.”\nStewart expressed his disdain for the conservative media without holding back, charging them with creating a climate in which such flagrant lies could proliferate unchecked. “To admit their own political gamesmanship, their own attempts at weaponizing justice, their own relentless pursuit of opponents, their own dehumanizing rhetoric towards the left would be to allow a molecule of reality into the airtight distortion field that has been created to protect Magadonians from the harsh glare of actuality,” he fumed.\nStewart ended by drawing a comparison between the media circus and the courtroom. “The difference between in court and out of court is that, in court, someone can say ‘prove it,’” Stewart said. “And the problem is that most of the time in this country, our political leaders are not in court. They are here on TV, where the news media has decided that there’s really no such thing as reality.”",

    "text": "The fiery colors were there, on the night of Thursday October 10 to Friday October 11, in the Alpes-Maritimes and the [Var](/tag/Var). Spectacular northern lights could indeed be observed in the sky of our two departments, as scientists had announced a few days earlier. Many readers of [Nice](/tag/Nice)-Matin and Var-Matin sent us beautiful photos during the night, after admiring this rare and unique spectacle. From Nice Here, a photo sent by Cassandra from Fabron Hill, in Nice. You can even see a shooting star, the highlight of the show! Whether from Vence, Carros, [Grasse](/tag/Grasse), Gréolières or Lorgues, the Côte d’Azur Weather Facebook page – Livealso shared photos, each more spectacular than the last. But individuals were also able to have fun. Taken from Nice, this photo, sent by Ivar, is adorned with magnificent pink hues. Here a photo taken by Laurine from [Le Cannet](/tag/Le+Cannet). In the Var Same thing in the Var this fabulous night, where the sky was adorned with pink glow on the northern horizon, thanks to a solar storm which offered us its most beautiful hues. Here in Castellet, this photo, sent by Vincent, looks like a painting. The weather conditions were perfect for optimal observation. Thus, in places where light pollution was minimal, the lucky ones were able to see a sky tinted with purple and pink. At Luc, still in the Var, Dorian witnessed an incredible show, which he shared with us. Solar storms can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, a flow of plasma made up of charged particles, which takes up to a few days to reach Earth. For a crazy show. Their interaction with the Earth’s magnetic field produces the Northern Lights, similar to gigantic, undulating, colorful curtains of light.",

    "text": "Director General Daniel Alvarez, left, and John Kutsch. (Photo: TEA)\nRepresentatives of El Salvador’s government and the Thorium Energy Alliance have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote El Salvador’s plan for renewable energy through thorium.\nThe document was signed on March 14 by Daniel Alvarez, director general of energy, hydrocarbons, and mines, and John Kutsch, executive director of the Thorium Energy Alliance, at the El Salvador embassy in Washington, D.C. The signing was witnessed by Milena Mayorga, El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States.\nThe purpose of the agreement is to formally establish the framework for cooperation between the Thorium Energy Alliance and El Salvador to develop a strategic plan to deploy thorium-powered reactors and thermal energy storage systems. Thorium is a naturally occurring element that can be used as fuel to generate electricity in advanced nuclear reactors.\nThey said it: “I am pleased to announce the launch of this innovative project that will revolutionize the energy landscape of El Salvador,” said Alvarez.\nKutsch added, “The leadership of El Salvador is rising and taking the bold steps necessary to ensure access to abundant and reliable energy, with the goal of ensuring a future of prosperity or all.\"\nMayorga noted, “Through this effort, we are fulfilling President Nayib Bukele's mandate to consolidate the diversification strategy of our energy matrix to improve the economy and well-being of our citizens.\"\nEl Salvador’s energy: Currently, the bulk of the country’s electric power comes from fossil fuels, but gains are being made by hydropower, biomass, solar, and geothermal energy.\nEl Salvador uses about 6 million MWh of electric energy per year, according to WorldDate.info .\nAbout the Alliance: The Thorium Energy Alliance is an education-focused organization composed of scientists and engineers who are committed to reducing the cost of energy, increasing the availability of critical materials, and protecting the environment.",

    "title": "Review: Dragon Takers (Nintendo Switch)",
    "text": "Rarely do I see an RPG stubble and fall in such rapid succession, but Dragon Takers does just that. Despite some initial promise, it quickly makes one blunder after another. Sadly, this release is one of the most boring RPGs I’ve ever played.\nThe main gimmick in this game is the protagonist’s newfound ability as a “Skill Taker.” He’s able to take moves from monsters during combat and pick and choose which to equip, limited only by what level you’ve reached. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this idea. In fact, the variety of monsters (viewed in a first-person perspective) had me somewhat intrigued. But with the focus on combat, you’d hope this area excelled. Unfortunately, it’s not even close.\nRather than break into a long-winded rant, I’ll limit my complaints to two key areas. The first (arguably foremost) is the curious decision to omit any means to escape a battle. Buried in the press release, it states, “escape is not an option.” A bold choice, perhaps, but certainly not a smart one. It simply doesn’t fit this style of turn-based RPG. If the enemies were visible on the map, maybe I could be swayed, but it’s entirely random. And the combat is nowhere near enjoyable enough to justify the lack of such a fundamental option.\nTo further weaken combat, enemy resistances and weaknesses are listed on the side of the screen. I didn’t even notice this until I was a few hours in, as playing in handheld mode, the text was small. But it’s always present, even when playing in “Normal” difficulty. Add in the fact that the game autosaves nonstop, and it eliminates any challenge the lack of escape could’ve leant. All you’re left with is the mundane tedium of combat that never really goes anywhere to reach its potential. Swing and a miss.\nAt least the game presents a solid audio/visual package. The music is very listenable, giving a blend of creepiness and relaxation that works better than you might expect, and I kind of like it. Characters bob their heads, move their arms, their hair flaps… little things like that make them seem livelier. Of course, their expressions never change regardless of what is happening in the story, good or bad.\nSpeaking of story, there’s a reason I haven’t talked about that until six paragraphs into my review, and it’s not because of spoilers. It’s not done well. Dragon Takers is filled with long stretches of cliched dialogue. Sometimes, you’ll have several minutes of generic conversation, take a step or two, and more will follow. I actually don’t mind this so much in the towns, as the NPCs feel more real. And talking to them is all you’ll do in towns as items get acquired not at shops, but during combat or found in dungeons. But outside of this, the lead and his female allies chatting about another fantasy trope just made me want to take control and get on the move. Not that there is much to move to. Dragon Takers is an especially linear game, with tiny distances between towns and short maze dungeons. No allowance is there to go off the story path and explore.\nDragon Takers feels haphazardly slapped together, and the longer I played it, the more boring its stale gameplay became. I don’t know much about the developer (Vanguard), but if KEMCO is going to keep working with them, I hope they can steer them in smarter directions. Dragon Takers is a poor game that I can’t recommend.\nReview: Dragon Takers (Nintendo Switch)\nPoor\nDragon Takers feels haphazardly slapped together, and the longer I played it, the more boring its stale gameplay became.
