    "text": "“Let’s hope it’s not always like this”: with these words Paolo Sottocorona greeted Omnibus viewers and released the latest weather forecast. What was he referring to? To the “few clouds” and the possibility of new rains that fade away day after day because the heat is getting the better of it. Things are, however, a little better. “Yesterday’s forecast predicted a total absence of precipitation in the Alpine areas. Today, something changes”, he anticipated. In the Alpine area, in fact, “there is the possibility of isolated but significant phenomena in the afternoon hours”, he explained. “Then, there is a small spot in the area of ​​Lake Garda”, he specified.\nInstability will also be present tomorrow, “although reduced”. In the Alps “there are many phenomena. Once again, something from Trentino descends towards the plain”. What is happening in the Centre and South? “Needless to say”: the expert was telegraphic. On Thursday, however, “there is a beginning of change”, he warned. In the North-West areas, there are some isolated phenomena. “Strong instability in Trentino Alto Adige, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna”, continued the meteorologist. Precipitation could be “very abundant”. Finally, minimum temperatures are always “high”.\n#Weather #Sottocorona #speaks #heavy #precipitation #Tempo\n2024-08-01 23:33:57",

Un gros conflit autour du stade Artemio-Franchi oppose le club de la Fiorentina et la commune de Florence. Les travaux de l’enceinte ont démarré, mais le club avait demandé à la municipalité locale de les suspendre, notamment à cause de la réduction temporaire de la capacité du stade qui va porter préjudice à la Viola pendant les travaux (le club demandait d’ailleurs également des dommages et intérêts). Le tribunal a rejeté la demande ce mercredi, et indique que les travaux du stade vont se poursuivre. L’équipe jouera donc dans un stade de 24 000 places (au lieu de 41 000) cette saison. La tribune Fiesole, où sont réunis les plus fervents supporters de la Fio, sera fermée pendant le chantier. Les aménagements sont prévus jusqu’en 2026. Bref, c’est un peu la zuppa à la grimace.

    "title": "Gianforte vetoes Styrofoam food containers phase-out bill",
    "text": "Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed a bill this week that sought to phase out the use of polystyrene, single-use food containers in the state over the next 4 ½ years.\nHouse Bill 477 would have prohibited restaurants and other food services from using the containers made of polystyrene – better known under its popular brand name Styrofoam – by the start of 2030. Gianforte said the bill amounted to government overreach.\n“Montanans don’t take kindly to federal overreach, and I’m proud we’ve consistently stood up against it. As state government, we should be consistent, actively avoiding such overreach here in Montana,” the governor wrote in his letter vetoing the measure. “Our state should remain a sanctuary for freedom and free enterprise, and let high taxes, high spending, and hyper-regulation remain a feature of deep blue, progressive states.”\nThe polystyrene phase-out under the bill would have started on the first day of 2028, when restaurants would be barred from serving food or drinks in polystyrene containers if they were going to be consumed on site. It would not apply to raw, uncooked meat, eggs or poultry.\nBy the next Jan. 1, restaurants, food establishments, resorts and hotels would not be to serve food or drinks in such containers or provide them as to-go containers. And by Jan. 1, 2030, no food packager in the state could use polystyrene packaging for any type of prepared food or baked goods.\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Marliyn Marler, a Missoula Democrat, provided exemptions that would allow the use of such containers if a restaurant could prove there was no alternative packaging that could be used or if doing away with Styrofoam would cause them “undue hardship.” Other exemptions include if the foam was to be used for transportation, construction, health or safety.\nExplaining the bill to her colleagues throughout its legislative process, Marler said polystyrene has already been proven by researchers and the federal government to be bad for human and environmental health, and that it is bad for Montana’s economy because it is not produced here and can’t be recycled or repurposed.\nMany companies, including some in Montana, have already started producing alternative food containers, she said, also offering that Styrofoam could go the way of the seat belt or pull-off beer tabs.\n“Did we wait for that to just solve itself or did we pass some laws across the country?” Marler told her House colleagues in March. “Well, guess what? It works.”\nMany Republicans who opposed the bill said they already believe polystyrene is being phased out naturally by the free market after years of information showing it is bad for health and the environment. Why put a government-imposed timeline on the phase out, they asked.\nAfter a Senate committee pushed the dates of the phase-out back, the Senate as a whole changed the bill back to its form as it came out of the House, albeit on a narrow 26-24 vote.\nUltimately, despite receiving enough bipartisan support to narrowly pass both chambers, Gianforte had little regard for it. Both in his veto letter and in a video announcing his veto he didn’t want to spend more money for the Department of Environmental Quality to review exception requests or place any more costs on Montana businesses and consumers.\n“The state banning Styrofoam is costly government overreach, and like many Montanans, I enjoy a hot coffee in a Styrofoam cup because it keeps it hot,” the governor said as he sipped coffee out of a cup with a veto stamp on it. “And this bill is a hot mess.”",

    "text": "Rédoine Faïd demande un allègement de ses conditions de détention à Vendin-le-Vieil De retour à l'établissement pénitentiaire de Vendin-le-Vieil dans le Pas de Calais, le \"roi de la belle\" doit rester incarcéré jusqu'en 2060. Devant le tribunal administratif de Lille, il a demandé que son accès au parloir soit assoupli. Il doit se rendre dans un parloir avec une vitre intégrale. Le \"roi de la belle\" est de retour dans le Pas-de-Calais. Rédoine Faïd est à nouveau incarcéré dans la prison de Vendin-le-Vieil, depuis fin novembre et après son procès qui lui a valu [une condamnation à 14 ans de prison fin octobre pour l'évasion en hélicoptère de la prison de Réau (Seine-et-Marne)](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/faits-divers-justice/redoine-faid-condamne-a-14-ans-de-prison-pour-son-evasion-en-helicoptere-de-la-prison-de-reau-en-2018-6565481). Avec ses autres condamnations notamment pour un braquage à Roclincourt, dans le Pas-de-Calais en 2011 et pour l'évasion de la prison de Loos-Sequedin en 2013, le braqueur de 51 ans ne pourrait pas sortir de prison avant 2060. Devant le tribunal administratif de Lille, jeudi 28 décembre, il a donc demandé un allègement de ses conditions d'accès au parloir. Lui qui vit à l'isolement depuis dix ans. Aucun contact physique depuis des années Il peut se rendre au parloir deux fois par semaine pour voir ses proches, mais dans un parloir hygiaphone où une vitre les sépare entièrement et ils doivent se parler à travers un téléphone. \"Rédoine Faïd veut démarrer une nouvelle phase de sa détention\", a déclaré son avocate à l'audience. Elle ajoute qu'il n'a \"pas serré sa famille dans ses bras depuis des années\". \"On ne voit pas comment un projet de détention peut-être envisagé dans ces circonstances\", ajoute Me Emmanuelle Choppin qui assiste Me Benoit David. Mais le ministère de la Justice n'est pas de cet avis. Il en prend pour preuve les deux évasions du roi de la belle : à l'explosif à Loos-Sequedin en 2013 et en hélicoptère à Réau en 2018. A chaque fois, Rédoine Faïd est passé par le parloir. Selon le directeur de la prison de Vendin-le-Vieil, il n'a en plus pas \"montré de repentance par rapport aux faits commis\", c'est pourquoi \"sa dangerosité reste actuelle\". Une dangerosité qui \"reste actuelle\" Il rappelle que, comme les autres détenus, Rédoine Faïd a droit à une après-midi et une journée entière au parloir par semaine. Il a aussi un téléphone dans sa cellule et il passe un nombre \"extrêmement conséquent d'appels\", ajoute la représentante du ministère. La présidente constate que les avis médicaux récents ne pointent pas de dégradation de sa santé mentale, à cause du parloir. Mais son avocate, avant la fin des débats, glisse que les médecins se prononcent rarement contre l'isolement d'un détenu. La décision sera rendue ce vendredi. Ma France : quelle école pour demain ? Pédagogie positive, innovations, inclusion, mais aussi drames du harcèlement, sureffectifs ou encore salaire des enseignants… ces sujets qui concernent l’école en France sont au cœur de l’actualité et de l’attention d’une immense majorité de citoyens.",

Sachdeva accused Kejriwal and AAP of lacking moral character and expressed concerns over the court's serious observations regarding Kejriwal's arrest and the excise policy scam. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 12:46 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 12:46 IST - Country: - India In a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal following his bail approval by the Supreme Court, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva called for Kejriwal's immediate resignation, citing a lack of moral character. 'If he has any morality left, he should resign immediately. Arvind Kejriwal and AAP have no moral character and are far removed from the true essence of 'Satyameva Jayate,'' said Sachdeva. He added that despite the Supreme Court declaring Kejriwal's arrest legal, AAP continues to misinterpret the term 'Satyameva Jayate.' Sachdeva further stated, 'Bail does not equate to acquittal. Arvind Kejriwal has just joined the 'jamanati club'. The court has serious observations about his arrest in the excise policy scam. The legal process is ongoing, and if convicted, Kejriwal and his aides will face punishment.' The Supreme Court granted Kejriwal bail in a corruption case related to the alleged excise policy scam on Friday, asserting that prolonged incarceration would be an unjust deprivation of liberty. The Court had previously reserved its verdict on September 5 after the hearings. Kejriwal, arrested by the ED on March 21, 2024, and later by CBI on June 26, 2024, is under investigation for money laundering linked to irregularities in the now-cancelled Delhi excise policy of 2021-22.
