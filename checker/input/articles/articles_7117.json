    "title": "\"Grown Men\" Fight Over Getting Splashed With Water on Disney World Ride",
    "text": "Multiple “grown men” recently fought over getting splashed with water on Magic Kingdom Park ’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride. According to a video of the incident, the fight began because a Walt Disney World Resort guest used his water bottle to splash other guests on board the Adventureland attraction.\nOn July 12, a Walt Disney World Resort guest named Jennalynn (@jennalynnmj) shared footage of the fight on TikTok. “POV: You get off pirates at MK and two grown men start arguing over water.”\n@jennalynnmj On a 100° day somebody could splash me with water all they want #wdw #magickingdom #disneyworld #disney #piratesofthecaribbean #fight #waltdisneyworld\n♬ original sound – Jennalynn\nThe video begins with three men arguing in the gift shop at the Pirates of the Caribbean exit. The man accused of splashing riders with his water bottle admonishes the other two guests for not acting like “adults.”\n“This is Disney World, not your world!” one of the men yells back.\nCredit: Disney\nThen, the men split up. A woman can be heard screaming, “HELP!”, and the man with the water bottle approaches a Disney cast member to point out the party involved. After he walks away, one of the men from the beginning of the video and a woman (possibly the same one who yelled for help) tell the confused cast member that the man took his full water bottle and spun it around, splashing everyone on the ride.\nWhen the couple realizes Jennalynn is recording, they’re not happy.\n“Oh good, you’re recording, good job, guys,” the man says, sarcastically giving a thumbs up.\nCredit: Ed Aguila, Inside the Magic\n“This is my cheap entertainment,” Jennalynn responds.\nAs more Disney cast members approach, Jennalynn interjects to tell them that the man beside her “started the argument.” “Neither party handled it well,” someone nearby added.\n“Don’t worry,” the Disney cast member replies. “Relax.”\nCredit: Inside the Magic\nJennalynn didn’t understand the problem: “On a 100° day somebody could splash me with water all they want.”\nDisney Parks fans were divided in the comments. Some agreed with Jennalynn.\n“They’re going after that cast member complaining like petulant children.. that CM who has to wear THAT COSTUME (iykyk) in an open air/barely any ceiling store in 100 degree weather.. those socks alone are insufferable any time a year, especially summer,” @squeezibean commented.\nCredit: Disney Dining\n“They know they get wet ON that ride, right?” @magicalbumblebri asked.\nOthers said they would’ve responded similarly if someone had splashed them.\n“I don’t want some random person throwing water or whatever he wants on me,” @d379pr argued.\nCredit: Disney\n“Okay but I’d be s mad if someone sprayed their water bottle on me they had every right to call him out,” @hannah_backwards9 agreed. “Who does that? Especially with the price of those smart waters.”\nStill, some Walt Disney World Resort fans felt that everyone involved in the fight could have handled the situation better.\n“Too many people and a bunch of foolery,” @nicosabuco wrote.\nCredit: Disney\n“Please ban all of them,” @mrcoache replied.\nThis is just one of many controversies surrounding Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Public debate began in the late 2010s, when Walt Disney Imagineers replaced animatronic brides-for-auction with independent female pirates. Some Disney Parks fans agreed with the inclusive change; others felt it was sanitizing the realities of piracy. Still, another contingent of Disney Park guests said Imagineering didn’t go far enough.\nIn 2023, a TikToker user amassed widespread attention online after posting a video expressing her discomfort with the male pirate animatronics.\nCredit: Disney\n“I just think this is kind of a weird ride,” the Disney Park guest said. “I don’t know… It’s just a little bit rapey.”\nUnsurprisingly, the video garnered a lot of backlash. Still, some other women agreed with the TikToker’s take.\n“It feels like we’re the entertainment for them and I do not like it,” one user commented.\nCredit: Steve Wise, Flickr\n“I always felt violated on this ride,” said another.\nDespite the continued public debate, Walt Disney Imagineering has not announced plans for further Pirates of the Caribbean updates. However, a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed, family-friendly lounge called The Beak and Barrel is scheduled to debut in Adventureland at Magic Kingdom Park later this year.\nWhat’s the wildest thing you’ve seen another guest do at Magic Kingdom Park, EPCOT, Disney’s Hollywood Studios, or Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park? Let Disney Dining know in the comments!",

    "text": "Jackie ‘or’ Henderson revealed that she thought her ex -husband had died and was about to break the crying after a colleague said ‘she was no longer with us’ live in the air.\nThe Kiis FM star said that I initially feared the worst when her ‘Pete’ deleter de Peter interrupted the 50th birthday celebration of the breakfast program star on Friday to tell him that they had ‘lost’ their first husband, ‘ugly ‘Phil O’Neil.\nJust when Henderson was about to cry, Doppler clarified that O’Neil was simply leaving the parent company of the network, RNA, where he organized a successful morning program at the sister station WSFM Gold during the last four years.\n“What a hole, I liked it honestly exploding in crying,” he told his listeners.\n‘That was brutal, it was. Honestly, at that time my heart was like … honestly it was like for a second, I thought I had died.\n“I was about to … I could feel the tears that came, and then he said, you know, he leaves Arn.”\nNine has expelled Henderson’s ex a few months after he became the first person to overthrow the Talkback Radio Titan Ray Hadley of the network in the classifications for the first time in more than two decades.\nThe veteran station has renounced her successful morning program at WSFM Gold101.7 and is deserting the Sydney Sydney Station 2GB station, where a recently rebuilt night program will face.\nJackie ‘or’ Henderson was celebrating his 50th birthday live in the air when he was told that his first ‘ugo’ phil o’neil ‘husband was no longer with us’ and thought he had died\nO’Neil briefly married his radio star Jackie ‘or’ Henderson in the 90s (above, together)\nThe Disc Jockey, which has provided its trade in some of the largest radio networks in the country throughout its four decades, including Nova, Triple M, 96fm and Star 104.5, will debut on nine radio on March 4.\nO’Neil said that his new night program, which is executed from Tuesday to Fridays and will also be heard at the 4BC Sister Station with 2GB Brisbane headquarters, would fulfill his long ambition to make the transition to Talkback.\n“All the roads that I have traveled have taken to this moment,” he said.\n‘There are no finer radio stations to follow my conversation radius aspirations than in 2GB and 4BC.\n“This is really the most exciting and fundamental moment of my career.”\nThe measure occurs only a few months after O’Neil spectacularly the 2GB 2GB host of 2GB, Ray Hadley, in his second classifications survey last November before hanging his microphone for the last time last month.\nThe surprise victory was the culmination of four years of work in WSFM of O’Neil, who joined the west attire of Sydney in 2020 and gradually built his audience of the morning program while claiming the acra prize of the industry for the best host of the Music last year.\nHe said he was sad to leave his ‘second home’, but waiting for the new challenge of winning another new audience.\nO’Neil has renounced its successful WSGM Gold morning program and has defected Talkback Station 2GB\n“WSFM Gold101.7 has been more than just my radio station during the last four years, it has been my second home,” O’Neil said.\n‘I will definitely miss the laughs with my fantastic co -workers and also with the listeners who have become such great friends. Devils … I could even miss playing Roxette!\nThe content director of the Gold Network, Sue Carter, said they had agreed to free O’Neil from her early contract to be able to follow her Talkback dream and left the media company in good terms.\n“Phil is unique in his class, I have known him for decades and during that time I have seen that his radio passion only becomes stronger,” he said.\n‘When he told us that he had the opportunity to organize a program overnight in 2GB, we do not hesitate to free him from any contractual obligation.\n‘While we will miss him in the air, we are excited by him as he embarks on this next adventure.\n“We send it with our best wishes and a great thanks for everything that has brought to the station.”\nRadio Radio Content Manager Greg Byrnes said that signing O’Neil was a coup d’etat for both the network and his listeners.\nO’Neil has been working in the same building as his ex -wife and his radio star Jackie ‘or’ Henderson and his breakfast Kyle Sandiland during the last four years\nO’Neil briefly became the new radio host of Sydney’s morning radio in its time interval last November\n“Phil will bring fresh energy at night and is an exciting addition to our new alignments in Sydney and Brisbane,” he said.\n‘It is attractive, entertaining and has loyal followers. Phil loves the Talk Radio and our morning listeners will love to meet him ‘.\nWhen the WSFM radio presenter dethroned Hadley in Sydney’s morning hours played in November, it was the first time that the 2GB radio king had lost a survey of qualifications in two decades.\nO’Neil, who organizes his 9 am to 1 pm program, took the pole position after attracting 12.7 percent of the available audience, raising 0.5 percentage points.\nHadley had enjoyed an undefeated survey of 160 qualifications, when his show fell 1.3 percentage points, obtaining a 11.1 percent participation, third place after Smoothfm 95.3 with 11.2 percent of the audience.\nHowever, he recovered first place the following month in his latest radio grades survey before retiring.\nPhil began his radio career in the 1990s as the host of the Hot30 countdown before landing in Nova 969 and Triple M.\nIn 2004, he returned to the United Kingdom and worked on the radio before traveling back to Australia.\nO’Neil knocked Ray Hadley 2GB in the second Talkback Titan classifications before his retirement, just for the outgoing host to recover first place the next month\nJackie ‘or’ Henderson met\nThe move to WSFM saw him working in the same building as his ex-wife Jackie ‘or’ Henderson, who co-anfila the popular FM breakfast program at the Kiis 106.5 RNA, which is transmitted from 6 am to 10 am to 10 am\nHenderson and his Kyle Sandiland Coanfrerion have once again claimed the upper position for their breakfast time interval despite a drop to 13.1 percent of the audience.\nThe couple met while working together on the coast of Gold in the 1990 Just a year later.\nHis separation in 1999 led to his final radio program and Phil to return to the United Kingdom.\nHenderson married Lee Henderson, with whom he shares his daughter, 12 -year -old Kitty, before they broke in 2018 after 15 years of marriage.\nJackie and Phil separated in 1999.

    "text": "IBM Aktie: Knappe Luft?\nIBM setzt alles auf eine Karte: Während die Aktie des Tech-Konzerns seit Wochen unter Druck steht, treibt das Unternehmen seine Expansion in Zukunftstechnologien wie Quantencomputing und künstliche Intelligenz in Asien voran. Der jüngste Coup: eine strategische Partnerschaft mit der indischen Regierung. Doch können diese langfristigen Investitionen die enttäuschten Anleger überzeugen?\nQuanten-Allianz mit Indien\nIBM hat in Mumbai ein neues Kundencenter eröffnet, das sich gezielt auf die Bereiche KI, Hybrid-Cloud und Quantencomputing konzentriert. Noch bedeutsamer ist die Unterzeichnung einer Absichtserklärung mit der Regierung von Maharashtra. Die Partnerschaft soll die Quanteninitiativen des Bundesstaates unterstützen und IBM als Schlüsselpartner für Indiens nationale Quantenstrategie positionieren.\n\"Damit baut IBM seine Vorreiterrolle im Quantencomputing aus und sichert sich frühzeitig Zugang zu einem der wichtigsten Zukunftsmärkte\", kommentiert ein Branchenkenner. Das Unternehmen setzt darauf, mit lokalen Partnern ein Ökosystem für Quantentechnologie in Indien aufzubauen – inklusive der Ausbildung dringend benötigter Fachkräfte.\nMarkt bleibt skeptisch\nTrotz der strategischen Initiativen kämpft die IBM-Aktie mit anhaltender Skepsis. Nach den letzten Quartalszahlen rutschte der Titel weiter ab, getrieben von enttäuschenden Ergebnissen im Software-Segment. Seit dem Jahreshoch im Februar hat die Aktie bereits fast 20 Prozent an Wert verloren.\nAnalysten sind gespalten: Während einige die langfristige Strategie des Unternehmens mit seinem Fokus auf Hybrid-Cloud und KI-betzer Software loben, zweifeln andere an der Wachstumsdynamik im Vergleich zu reinen Cloud-Konzernen. \"IBM ist kein reines Tech-Wachstumsunternehmen, sondern ein stabiler Player mit starken Margen im Unternehmenskundengeschäft\", relativiert ein Marktbeobachter.\nDie entscheidende Frage bleibt: Wann spiegeln sich die milliardenschweren Investitionen in Zukunftstechnologien endlich in den Zahlen wider? Bis dahin dürfte die Volatilität hoch bleiben.\nIBM-Aktie: Kaufen oder verkaufen?! Neue IBM-Analyse vom 14. August liefert die Antwort:\nDie neusten IBM-Zahlen sprechen eine klare Sprache: Dringender Handlungsbedarf für IBM-Aktionäre. Lohnt sich ein Einstieg oder sollten Sie lieber verkaufen? In der aktuellen Gratis-Analyse vom 14. August erfahren Sie was jetzt zu tun ist.\nIBM: Kaufen oder verkaufen? Hier weiterlesen...",

    "text": "By Hella Winston, Susan Edelman ,\n2 hours ago\nA former city prosecutor turned religious school teacher has been charged with raping a 13 year-old girl, The Post has learned.\nDaniel Haines, 39, an ex-Bronx and Brooklyn assistant district attorney who taught at Mt. Carmel-Holy Rosary in East Harlem, is also accused of taking cell phone videos of their sexual contact, and exchanging “multiple photos and videos of a sexual nature” via email with her, according to a criminal complaint filed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\nThe alleged abuse took place “on multiple occasions” between April 18, 2022 and April 7, 2023, when the victim was in 7th and 8th grade, the complaint states.\nHe was arrested on May 17.\nHaines worked at Mount Carmel-Holy Rosary School. Google A partially redacted address cited in the complaint indicates the abuse occurred at Mt. Carmel, where Haines was a teacher at the time.\n‘The Simpsons’ showrunner slams fake image that ‘predicted’ Diddy’s downfall: ‘Digital misinformation’\nThe complaint alleges one act of forcible rape occurred against a desk.\nMt. Carmel principal Trista Rivera sent an email to parents saying they can call the Manhattan DA’s child abuse bureau at 212-335-4300 if their children “had any type of contact” with Haines.\n“The school has been and will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation into this allegation,” Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, told The Post.\nRivera and Zwilling did not explain why Haines left Mt. Carmel, or confirm that the 13-year-old victim was a student at the school, causing some confusion and worry among parents.\nDear Abby: My friend is in an abusive relationship, I’m worried for her safety\nHaines worked in the Bronx DA’s office from 2009 to 2019, a spokesman said.\nHe prosecuted major gang and drug cases in the rackets bureau.\nHe then briefly worked at the Brooklyn DA’s office. Spokesman Oren Yaniv refused to say why he left. His last city salary was $105,000.\nAfter that, Haines took a job at Mt. Carmel, where the average teacher’s salary is $54,768 .\nHe stayed until the end of the 2022-23 school year.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER\nOne Mt. Carmel parent told The Post that she complained about Haines, her child’s 6th and 7th grade English teacher.\n“I thought he was terrible but the principal either ignored me or told me he cares about the kids,” she said. “Then he left the school, but he would always pop up. It’s just weird.”\nStarting in September of 2023, Haines joined the Heschel School, a Jewish day academy on the Upper West Side, where he taught middle grades, and coached basketball and mock trial.\nIn a recent letter to parents, head of school Ariela Dubler and board president Ben Archibald said, “All of the alleged misconduct occurred prior to Daniel’s arrival at Heschel. We have no knowledge of any allegations of criminal or inappropriate conduct within the Heschel community.”\nHaines was hired after reference and criminal background checks, the letter says. When the school learned of his arrest, “We placed him on leave and terminated his access to our systems and buildings.”\nHaines pleaded not guilty and was released on $350,000 cash bail, records show.\nHis Legal Aid attorney did return a call for comment.\nFor the latest metro stories, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/metro/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Resilient NY bull rider returns to compete at MSG a year after tearing his groin off at ‘Unleash the Beast’ event",
    "text": "Life can’t buck him off. A year after tearing his groin clean off at Madison Square Garden, world champion bull rider Daylon Swearingen returned to the World’s Most Famous Arena over the weekend seeking another 24 thrilling seconds atop a ferocious beast. “Last year here I actually tore my groin off my pelvis,” the Piffard, New York, cowboy told The Post Friday. “Groins are like a pretty big injury — not a lot of people tear them all the way off.” Swearingen, 24, suffered the gruesome injury in round two of the Professional Bull Riders league’s crown jewel event of its Unleash the Beast series. Riders must hang onto a bucking bull for a full eight seconds to gain points towards millions of dollars in prize money. “I had a partial tear and then, all of a sudden, it tore completely,” he recalled. “That put me out for about six months.” Now all healed, the 5-foot-6, 150-pound star was unfazed about returning to the big stage at the Garden, saying it was all about “keeping your mental game at the top.” “Anything can be frustrating if you let it,” Swearingen said with a slight southern lilt from his Midtown hotel. “The way I look at it is, that’s part of bull riding.\n“My body already knows how to ride the bull and as long as my mind knows that I can ride that bull too, you know, and I think that’s the biggest thing,” he said. “Making sure you hit the refresh button and go do it, do what you need to do.” Swearingen is no stranger to second chances — in fact, they run in his family. He was just a child when his mother Carrie Swearingen was shot in the head by her estranged husband. She miraculously survived and moved Daylon and his younger brother Colton from South Carolina to her hometown of Piffard. “You couldn’t tell by looking at my mom, but if you pull the back of her hair up, you can see it. She’s still got like 22 pieces of shrapnel in there,” Daylon said. “I think that’s where a lot of my toughness comes from — it’s probably from my mom. There’s always a chance when something bad traumatizes you, you can pick a path. And she definitely picked a path — went back to school to be a nurse.” Carrie, now a registered nurse, played a key role in her son’s burgeoning bull-riding ambitions, taking him from horsing around at home to mutton-busting as a youngster. “I’ve always been involved in rodeo, me and my brother were always,” Daylon recalled. “It sounds bad but we used to ride my mom. Pretend she was a bull. When we were little kids, we’d put a little rope on her and try to ride her like she was the bull.” Daylon has put his affection for his mom on full display to his 72,000 Instagram followers, posting about her winning top honors in her own profession — a DAISY Award. “Beyond proud of my mom,” he wrote in June with a photo of them grinning together. It’s been a short ride to the top for Daylon, who turned pro in 2018 and has $2.5 million in lifetime earnings. He currently sits in 24th place in the Unleash the Beast series with 62 points and closed out his championship 2022 season with 1,567.50 points. At MSG, Daylon squared off against 40 of the world’s best bull riders seeking the golden buckle championship in the multi-city competition. The finals are in Texas in May. “I’m excited to be back,” the young bovine boss said. “Any time you come to Madison Square Garden, you know it’s a different atmosphere inside there and you can’t really describe it.” On opening night Friday, Daylon bucked off “in a super second,” quicker than he could anticipate. “I kinda just sat down and he pulled me to the outside and bucked me off,” he said “As soon as I thought about the change I had to make, I was laying on the ground.” He made up for it on Saturday, scoring 85.5 points after vowing that he was “gonna stay on that son of a bitch for eight seconds.” “This is a really humbling sport, you know. You can be on the tippy top one week,” Daylon said. “I mean, even in 2022 when I won it. One week [I was] carried out on a stretcher, the next week I won two events, so it’s a super humbling sport. Just in and out throughout the whole season.”",
