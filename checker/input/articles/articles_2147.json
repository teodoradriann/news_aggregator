    "text": "Love over hatred, life after death and the joys of holidays: Bishops wish their communities a happy Easter The region's bishops have spoken of life after death, togetherness through division and the importance of holidays in their Easter messages. Watch more of our videos on Shots! and live on Freeview channel 276 Ahead of the annual weekend which marks the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Bishops of Worcester and Dudley and the acting Bishop of Wolverhampton have delivered their messages to worshippers across the Dioceses of Worcester and Lichfield. The Bishop of Worcester, Right Reverend Dr John Inge used his message to talk about the idea of resurrection and life after death and offered a different interpretation of the resurrection of Christ involving two twins in the womb. He said: \"At Easter, we celebrate the glorious resurrection of Jesus from the dead. \"Maybe you find the idea of resurrection difficult? Maybe the whole idea of life after death is unbelievable for you? Well I’d like to offer you a parable, to encourage further reflection. \"Imagine twins talking to each other in their mother’s womb. \"One says the other: 'Do you believe in life after delivery?' The other replies: 'Why, of course. There has to be something – maybe we are here to prepare ourselves for what we will be later.' \"'How ridiculous' says the first. 'There can’t possibly be life after delivery. What kind of life would that be?' \"The second says: 'I don’t know, I’m just guessing, but maybe there will be more light than here. Maybe we will walk with our legs and eat using our mouths. Maybe we will have other senses that we can’t understand now.' \"The first replied: 'That’s absurd. Walking is impossible. And eating with our mouths? Ridiculous! The umbilical cord supplies nutrition and everything we need. But the umbilical cord is so short. Logically, life after delivery cannot exist.' \"The second insisted: 'Well, I’m convinced there is something and maybe it’s different from it is here. Maybe we won’t need this physical cord anymore.' \"The first replied: 'That’s fantasy! And what’s more, if there is life after delivery, then why has no one has ever come back to us from there? It’s obvious that delivery is the end of life, and in the after-delivery there is nothing but darkness and silence and oblivion.' \"'Well, I don’t know' said the second, 'but I believe we shall meet Mother and that she will take care of us.' \"The first replied 'Mother? You actually believe in Mother? That’s laughable. If Mother exists then where is She now?' \"The second said: 'She is all around us. We are surrounded by her. We are of Her. It is in Her that we have life. Without Her this world would not and could not exist.' \"The first retorted: 'Well I can’t see Her, so logically, She can’t exist.' \"To which the second replied: 'Sometimes, when you’re in silence and you focus and you really listen, you can perceive Her presence, and you can hear Her loving voice, calling down from above.'\" The Bishop of Dudley, Right Reverend Martin Gorick, took a more convention route with his Easter message, talking about hate and vision and how God's love can help people to have the last laugh and the last word over evil and hatred. He said: \"We live in a time of division. We are passionate about what we believe in, but all too easily despise those we don’t agree with. \"Instead of asking ‘I wonder’, we can find that our mind is made up by whatever we see on social media, on TV or in our newspaper. \"Social media thrives on ‘Them and Us’ sending us anything that will grab and keep our attention and sending us more and more of the things that make us angry, or sad or make us laugh. \"This can be fine, or it can drive us into some dark places filled with hate and division. \"Good Friday and Easter show us another way. \"Jesus taught us to call God ‘Abba’, which means Father. As in the Lord’s Prayer which begins ‘Our Father’. \"If God is our father, then that means we are all sisters and brothers. Everyone, every human being. Not just our family, friends, tribe or nation. Not just those who are like me or who I agree with. But everyone. ‘With God as our Father, one family all are we.’ \"How different would our world be if we could really believe and live out that truth. \"We live in a hard world, and Jesus was put to death on a cross. As he died he looked at his oppressors and said, ‘Father forgive them, they know not what they do.’ Evil and hatred will never have the last word. \"Forgiveness and divine love are stronger still. Jesus was crucified and died as human evil did its worst. And Jesus stands with those who suffer today. \"But on Easter Sunday, Jesus rose from the dead. Alleluia! Love is come again, never to be defeated.\" The acting Bishop of Wolverhampton, Right Reverend Jonathan Clark, used his Easter message to talk about holidays and celebrations and the story of Easter. as well as wishing for those enjoying a break over Easter a restful and holy time. He said: \"Easter is early this year as it doesn’t often fall in March. So most schools are keeping on going right up till Good Friday, and schools will have an extra long summer term. \"Christians are coming to the end of Lent, our season of abstinence, while Muslims are about half way through the Ramadan fast. \"The Hindu community have just celebrated Holi, and Sikhs are about to celebrate Vaisakhi. \"I could go on, and quite apart from community holidays, there are our own celebrations of birthdays and anniversaries. All of us have our own calendar of holidays. \"‘Holiday’ was originally ‘holy day’. Days which were part of the religious calendar were also days off work, and often the only ones; it was only in 1938 that a long campaign by trades unions led to a legal entitlement to paid holiday for everyone. \"And still a holiday should be a time for rest and recreation, for enjoying all the good things in life. \"For me as a Christian, the very best thing is knowing that I am created and loved by God, who showed his love in the death and resurrection of Jesus. \"This Easter weekend I will be again walking with Jesus through his betrayal and trial, his death on the cross and his rising to new life on Easter Day. \"For me those are the holiest of holy days, ‘holidays’ from normal life in which I think about what is most important. \"Whatever you are doing in the next few weeks, may you be refreshed and renewed, and make a little time for the holy on your holiday.\"",

    "text": "WildSpark high-visibility reflective running shirts provide front and back all-over reflectivity to make runners more visible from any direction in low-light roadside situations. MARIETTA, GA â Reflective Apparel, which is known for making people visible with ANSI safety workwear, has launched WildSpark activewear, designed to keep runners, joggers and walkers visible in low-light urban settings from dusk to dawn. More than 7,000 pedestrians in the United States were killed in incidents involving a motor vehicle in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That equates to one death every 75 minutes. Reflective Apparel hopes to help reduce this number to zero by making people more visible with reflective performance activewear. âWildSpark really raises the safety standards for pedestrians. The same hi-vis safety-first thinking weâve used to keep workers safe for more than 30 years is now helping to keep pedestrians safe with our reflective running shirts,â said Scott A. Corrao, president of Reflective Apparel. âWe all know friends or family who have experienced a near miss, or even an injury, as a pedestrian. Danger knows no boundaries, so neither can safety. We believe that everyone should be visible and safe at all times.â Reflective Running Shirts WildSpark is introducing a new standard in pedestrian safety. After redefining the high visibility clothing market in B2B, the team at Reflective Apparel is taking on a new challenge of B2C reflective clothing and running gear with WildSpark. Whether someone is walking, jogging, cycling, skateboarding, running or participating in any other outdoor urban adventure, reflective safety gear is a must to be seen. The reflective patterns on WildSpark apparel appear brightly to drivers when a lightsource, such as headlights, hit the garment, turning the wearer into a shining beacon. Reflectivity is built into the fabric of the entire garment, maximizing visibility and making it easier for drivers to identify the wearer as human. Front and back all-over reflectivity makes runners more visible from any direction. âUntil you shine light on a WildSpark garment, you would assume it was just fashionable, performance apparel,â said Becky Keith, vice president of design and strategic accounts for Reflective Apparel. âOnce a headlight hits the garment, the retro-reflective properties are immediately apparent, making the wearer highly visible even in extremely low-light situations.â WildSpark reflective running shirts eliminate the need for clunky reflective vests and uncomfortable safety armbands, so runners can streamline their workout clothes. Unlike traditional activewear, which may include only small reflective details, WildSpark provides all-over reflectivity printed on the entire surface of the fabric. In addition to reflectivity, WildSpark shirts also feature: WildSpark hi-vis performance reflective running shirts are comfortable enough to wear all day so wearers can transition from day to night and stay visible in the dark. âOur philosophy is, as long as you are going to wear performance apparel, it should be wildly reflective as well,â said Corrao. âReflective gear doesnât have to call attention to you when it isnât wanted. We now have a solution to be comfortable, stylish and visible, all at the same time.â Reflective Apparel manufactures a complete line of ANSI 107-2020 reflective clothing and CSA compliant garments. Originally founded in 1989 to support the public safety marketâs need for nighttime reflectivity, Reflective Apparel was at the forefront of the ANSI standard for High Visibility. Reflective Apparel also brings safety-first thinking to performance comfort apparel with WildSpark high visibility reflective running shirts.

    "text": "昨晚你有睡得好吗？有没有一个香甜的美梦？（图片来源：Adobe Stock）\n熬夜工作到深夜，明明很困却睡不着；绵羊一只接一只，数着数着天就亮了。是什么原因导致的呢？除了自身因素，卧室里这7个摆设禁忌也可能会是吞噬你\n睡眠元凶！\n1、镜子\n镜子有反射光，这是一种不良的射线，会造成神经衰弱、睡眠质量差等不良反应。\n另外，关于镜子对床的一些传言，也让很多人对晚上的镜子有恐惧感，带着这种感觉入睡，怎能睡得好呢。\n2、闹钟\n看见闹钟，本身就有一种压力感，因为它到点就“爆发”。所以，床头最好不要放那种物理闹钟，那种滴答声，声声都是噪音。\n熟睡时，突然被大声的闹钟叫醒，会引起身体保护性的条件反射，体内肾上腺素水平迅速提高，心跳加快，血管收缩压升高。\n可以换个轻音乐的铃声，会缓解内心的紧张感。\n3、绿色植物\n很多人喜欢与自然共生，会在\n卧室床头摆放绿色植物，例如吊兰、绿萝、风信子等等。但是，绿植在晚上，无法进行光合作用，会吸入空气中的氧气，释放二氧化碳。但是这会导致人处于缺氧，不易进入深度睡眠，造成持续性疲劳。\n今晚你想睡得好吗？那就避开上述禁忌试试。（图片来源：Adobe Stock）\n4、电子设备\n想提高睡眠质量。一定要将带屏幕的电子设备，如手机、平板电脑、电视等物品带出卧室、远离床头。这些物品都会刺激你的大脑，让你精神处于兴奋状态，入睡困难，心绪不宁。\n想睡个好觉，先远离手机，让大脑彻底“关机休息”，尽快进入深度睡眠。\n5、床和门相对\n卧室是让我们卸下所有装备，放松身心的空间，如果床正对着门，会让人毫无私密性和安全感，觉得自己被一览无遗了。\n睡觉的时候，门对着床，感受也不好。\n建议把床靠墙，最好不要90°正对着门。\n6、床头有隔板、异物\n隔板不建议在床头用。因为床头背景这个位置取放东西很不方便，如果放置体积过大的物品，万一掉下来，打到脸上或头部的滋味都不好受。\n还有那种内凹型，摆放画作的，也会不小心掉了、砸到头，给酝酿睡眠的你当头一击，懊恼到失眠到天亮。\n床头最好干干净净，啥也没有，简单，舒心。\n7、床头摆浓烈的香水\n床头摆香水实在不适宜。因为香水、香氛中含有800多种人工化合物，存在一定程度的刺激性，有鼻炎的还会过敏，连环喷嚏连连。\n空间安静也包括气味的温润、舒服。\n如果想要好气味，可以在扩香石里滴1～2滴薰衣草精油，这样味道既不会太冲，还能有助于睡眠。\n看完这篇文章觉得\n- 新增评论成功\n- 新增评论失败\n评论\n排序\n- 先发表\n- 后发表\n- 最多顶\n- 最多讨论\n- 每页5个\n- 每页10个\n- 每页15个\n- 看全部",

    "text": "Collagen is well-known as an important component of skin, but its impact is much greater, as it is the most abundant protein in the body, providing structure and support to nearly all tissues and organs. Using their novel Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) 3D bioprinting technique, which allows for the printing of soft living cells and tissues, Carnegie Mellon’s Feinberg lab has built a first-of-its-kind microphysiologic system , or tissue model, entirely out of collagen. This advancement expands the capabilities of how researchers can study disease and build tissues for therapy, such as Type 1 diabetes.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250423547605/en/\nTraditionally, tiny models of human tissue that mimic human physiology, known as microfluidics, organ-on-chip, or microphysiologic systems, have been made using synthetic materials such as silicone rubber or plastics, because that was the only way researchers could build these devices. Because these materials aren’t native to the body, they cannot fully recreate the normal biology, limiting their use and application.\n“Now, we can build microfluidic systems in the Petri dish entirely out of collagen, cells, and other proteins, with unprecedented structural resolution and fidelity,” explained Adam Feinberg, a professor of biomedical engineering and materials science & engineering at Carnegie Mellon. “Most importantly, these models are fully biologic, which means cells function better.”\nIn new research published in Science Advances , the group demonstrates use of this FRESH bioprinting advancement, building more complex vascularized tissues out of fully biologic materials, to create a pancreatic-like tissue that could potentially be used in the future to treat Type 1 diabetes. This advancement builds on the team's earlier work published in Science , by improving the resolution and quality to create fluidic channels that are like blood vessels down to about 100-micron diameter.\n“It is paramount for everyone to understand the importance of team-based science in developing these technologies and the value varied expertise brings both to the project, and our impact on society,” elaborated Feinberg.\nThis technology is currently being commercialized by FluidForm Bio , a Carnegie Mellon spinout company.\nFeinberg and his collaborators are committed to releasing open-source designs and other technologies that allow for broad adoption within the research community. “We’re hoping that very quickly, other labs in the world will adopt and expand this capability to other disease and tissue areas,” Feinberg added. “We see this as a base platform for building more complex and vascularized tissue systems.”\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250423547605/en/\nUsing their novel (FRESH 3D bioprinting technique, which allows for the printing of soft living cells and tissues, Carnegie Mellon's Feinberg lab has built a first-of-its-kind microphysiologic system, or tissue model, entirely out of collagen.\nContacts Sara Pecchia\nsvaccar@andrew.cmu.edu\n412-268-1422\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms Of Service .",
