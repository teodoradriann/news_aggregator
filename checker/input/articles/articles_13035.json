    "text": "Quintessentially British and symbolic of a nation steeped in maritime tradition, the 100th anniversary of the first broadcast of the Shipping Forecast should be celebrated as a key moment when safety became a priority at sea.\nIt was exactly one hundred years ago, on 1 January 1924, that the very first clipped, British tones were heard delivering a weather bulletin called Weather Shipping.\nIn the UK, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) is responsible for the provision of maritime safety information ( MSI ) to ships at sea, which includes the broadcast of warnings and forecasts. The iconic Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast produced by the Met Office on behalf of the MCA . Although the Shipping Forecast officially came into existence in 1924, it was in October 1925 when it was first broadcast via the BBC.\nWe spoke to the Met Office’s archivist Catherine Ross about the significance in 2024 of the Shipping Forecast.\nIt’s a national institution,” Catherine, who has spent the past 11 years trawling the rich archives of the Met Office said.\nThat has so much more meaning behind it than just a forecast. It’s iconic.\nIt’s a history of the last 100 years of what’s happened around our shores, from a weather perspective of course but also maritime safety; the two are heavily linked and it is a big part of why the Met Office even exists.\nThe history of the forecast goes back to 1861, when Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy developed a telegraphic messaging system to issue weather warnings to ships, following the loss of the steam clipper Royal Charter. The vessel founded (sank) in a violent storm off the coast of Anglesey, with the loss of more than 450 lives, prompting FitzRoy’s desire to prevent it happening again.\nHe was the main influence in the early development of the Met Office, which was then primarily intended to improve safety at sea.\nIt has saved thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands of lives,” Catherine added.\nIt is impossible to accurately predict how many, but it really has been lifechanging for seafarers.\nIts relevance has probably changed from when its sole purpose was to provide information to UK mariners, because of all the technology and internet it can now be heard from anywhere in the world.\nIt has 100 years of trust behind it now and it has taken on a cultural aspect far beyond the maritime world, which all adds to its iconic status.\nTechnology will continue to move on, but that distinctive sound it has will remain for as long as people want it.\nIt’s almost poetic, almost beautiful, in the way that fixed-pattern forecast is read out. I really like the sound of it and know a lot of people do, it is familiar and it’s a voice from home.\nIn fact, it’s the voice of home.\nPress office\nEmail public.relations@mcga.gov.uk\nPress enquiries 020381 72222 (Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm)\nOutside these hours or on bank holidays and weekends, for media enquiries ONLY, please send an email outlining your query and putting #Urgent in the subject title.",

    "text": "It was a busy week in the biotech sector, with many regulatory and pipeline updates. Neumora Therapeutics [NMRA](/market-activity/stocks/nmra) plummeted on the announcement of a study failure, while Hoth Therapeutics [HOTH](/market-activity/stocks/hoth) gained on study data.\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:\nNMRA Stock Crashes on Study Failure\nNeumora Therapeutics announced the failure of its lead pipeline candidate, navacaprant, in a late-stage study for major depressive disorder (MDD). Shares of the company plummeted on the same.\nThe phase III KOASTAL-1 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of navacaprant against placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD over a six-week treatment period. The study failed to achieve its primary endpoint. Treatment with the drug failed to demonstrate a significant improvement over placebo in alleviating depression symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.\nThe study also failed to show statistically significant improvement in the reduction of anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure), as assessed by the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale.\nThe KOASTAL-1 study is one of the three late-stage studies in the KOASTAL program evaluating navacaprant in the MDD indication. Management continues to analyze the study results further, as it claimed that the drug showed an efficacy signal in female patients.\nHOTH Stock Soars on Study Data\nHoth Therapeutics announced positive interim safety and efficacy results from a mid-stage study of its lead candidate, HT-001, which is being developed to address skin toxicities linked to cancer patients undergoing treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Shares of HOTH surged on the data announcement.\nPer the data readout from the ongoing phase IIa study, all patients treated with the candidate achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of an ARIGA score ≤1, showing significant skin toxicity improvement by the six-week mark.\nAdditionally, 66% of patients treated with HT-001 reported reduced pain and itching scores, which significantly improved their quality of life. Importantly, all patients retained their full EGFR inhibitor dosage, ensuring the cancer treatment's complete therapeutic efficacy. This is a significant improvement over previous reports that highlighted frequent dose reductions or treatment interruptions caused by skin-related side effects.\nHOTH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nCPRX Stock Gains on Patent Litigation With Teva\nCatalyst Pharmaceuticals [CPRX](/market-activity/stocks/cprx) and its licensor, SERB, announced entering into a settlement agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals [TEVA](/market-activity/stocks/teva). The agreement resolves the patent litigation brought by Catalyst and SERB on Teva for submitting an abbreviated new drug application to the FDA seeking marketing approval for a generic version of Firdapse 10 mg tablets before applicable patents expire.\nPer the terms, Teva has agreed not to market its generic version of Firdapse in the United States, subject to approval, before Feb. 25, 2035, unless specific exceptions outlined in the agreement arise. Additionally, Catalyst/SERB and Teva will end all ongoing patent litigation over Firdapse patents in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.\nHowever, litigation against the remaining defendants continues. While Hetero faces claims for all Orange Book-listed patents for the drug, Lupin does the same for the Catalyst Firdapse patent expiring in 2037.\nVIR Stock Gains on Study Data\nVir Biotechnology [VIR](/market-activity/stocks/vir) presented encouraging safety and efficacy data in ongoing dose escalation studies for two of its dual-masked T-cell engagers (TCEs) — VIR-5818, targeting a variety of HER2-expressing solid tumors, and VIR-5500, targeting PSMA in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\nVIR-5818 is being evaluated in a phase I study for safety and pharmacokinetics alone, and in combination with pembrolizumab, in participants with a variety of HER2-expressing cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer. Early efficacy data indicate that 50% (10/20) of participants receiving VIR-5818 doses ≥400 µg/kg experienced dose-dependent tumor shrinkage across multiple HER2-positive tumor types.\nA phase I study is assessing the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of VIR-5500 in mCRPC patients. Early efficacy data show encouraging signs of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses. PSA reductions were observed in 100% of participants after an initial dose ≥120 µg/kg.\nData show encouraging preliminary safety and efficacy profiles with no dose-limiting cytokine release syndrome. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached as dose escalation continues, and early clinical response signals are observed in heavily pretreated participants.\nPerformance\nThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 0.85% in the past four trading sessions and Regeneron’s shares have gained 2.57%. In the past six months, shares of MRNA have lost 62.93%.

    "text": "Winter storms to bring heavy snow and flash flooding to the Midwest and Northeast\nTwo winter storms are expected to bring heavy snow, strong winds, severe thunderstorms and flash flooding to many parts of the northern U.S. starting Friday into next week.\nWinter alerts are up for 32 million people Friday and Saturday from the northern Rocky Mountains and Upper Midwest through the central Great Lakes region and into New England.\nThe first storm will move quickly and bring snow to eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan Friday, and the interior Northeast and New England Saturday. Light to moderate snow is expected in an area stretching from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes, where 2 to 7 inches of snow will fall overnight.\nSnow amounts Saturday and into the night in northern New England will be as high as 12 to 18 inches.\nThe second storm will kick off Sunday and could bring higher accumulations of snow and stronger winds to the Upper Midwest than the first storm. Unlike the first storm, however, it will not bring accumulating snow to New England.\nSunday’s snow and wind will impact North and South Dakota, Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. On Monday the storm will slow down and strengthen over the Upper Midwest, bringing continuous snow and strong wind gusts to the Dakotas and Minnesota. The snow will continue until at least midday Tuesday.\nSnow accumulations during the storm could be as high as 12 to 18 inches in parts of Minnesota, including the Minneapolis metro area and Duluth.\nThe area spanning from the Dakotas into western Minnesota is known as “blizzard alley,” and this region may live up to its name early next week. Winds are forecasted to be as high as 35 to 40 mph, which could bring blizzard conditions, especially on Monday and Tuesday.\nIn south Florida and southern New England, 53 million people are under flood watches. Cities in the risk zone include Miami, Washington, D.C., New York City and Boston.\nOn Friday, the flood risk is highest for south Florida, where 6 to 7 inches of rain could fall. Severe thunderstorms capable of high winds and isolated tornadoes will also be possible, especially for the Florida Keys.\nThe flood risk will shift to southern New England Saturday, where a widespread 2 to 4 inches is expected, including for the Interstate 95 corridor. Isolated areas of more than 4 inches cannot be ruled out, especially for coastal areas.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",
