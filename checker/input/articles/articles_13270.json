    "title": "Sir Nicholas Winton – The 'British Schindler': How on the eve of the Second World War, a quiet Home Counties stockbroker rescued hundreds of young lives from Nazi persecution | Express Digest",
    "text": "James Hawes, director of a new film about Nicky Winton, salutes the man who who saved the lives of thousands of children. Nicky Winton was a 29-year-old London stockbroker in 1938. He was the child of Jewish refugees, from a family that had left Germany for England in the 1870s. As war once again loomed over Europe, a friend alerted him to the refugee crisis in Prague, triggered by Britain’s signing of the Munich Agreement (that permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and Nazi Germany’s subsequent occupation of it). Winton volunteered to spend a week or two helping refugees, but when he saw first-hand how desperate and dangerous their situation was, he decided he had to try to change things. The kindertransport trains were bringing Jewish children out of Germany and Austria, but no refugees were being accepted from Czechoslovakia, mainly because the British government did not judge people there to be in any danger. The kindertransport programme saved the lives of nearly 10,000 young Winton in 1939, with a child rescued from Czechoslovakia. Winton found thousands of refugees, many of them children, living in open fields and ruined buildings around Prague, facing a brutal winter and the threat of Nazi invasion. Most were Jewish. Some were children of those who had opposed Hitler and were now in hiding. Winton was adamant that he wanted to save children ‘of all faiths and none’, that every life was equal. He set about raising funds and negotiating with the Home Office to allow the children into temporary refuge in Britain. And to those who told him it was impossible, he answered simply that he was determined to try. This film project first landed in my inbox with a script and a link to a YouTube clip from the BBC’s That’s Life! programme in 1988, when Winton was interviewed by Esther Rantzen. In it, she asks the assembled audience if anyone who owes their life to him is present. One by one, every adult in the room stands. It’s a piece of TV history that goes viral several times a year. The raw, understated emotion of the moment where Winton realises the impact of all that he achieved decades before, at the outbreak of war, is deeply moving. I’ve watched it a hundred times and it still gives me goosebumps – if you haven’t seen it, you need to. I dare you not to cry. Winton in 1998, at Prague’s main railway station That YouTube clip is both a gift and a challenge for a director. How do you re-create such an iconic screen moment? How do you add to it – if you even can? Well, casting Sir Anthony Hopkins is a good place to start. As he and I discussed how we would approach the film, he talked of the extraordinary humility that Winton emanates, the emotions all so controlled. No dramas. You do the thing because it is decent and right. My crew set out to make it as authentic as possible, from the costumes to the detail of every passport stamp and, where we could, shooting scenes in the locations where the real events took place. Early in our preparations, we were on reconnaissance in Prague, at the central station where most of the children boarded their trains towards England. At the end of the platform stands a bronze statue of Winton with two of the children he saved. We stopped to take photos when suddenly there were shouts, radios squawking, children crying. Police were escorting a crowd across the platforms. And then we realised these were refugees; dozens of women and children, newly arrived from Ukraine, dragging a few precious belongings with them. We all stood very quietly to take it in. Winton saw first hand just how desperate and dangerous the child refugees situation was Here we were, preparing to tell a story of another war and other refugees from more than 80 years ago, and history was repeating itself in front of us. It was a chilling moment. What would Winton have thought? For the scenes where the children say a last goodbye as they boarded the trains, the original archive tended to show lots of happy faces, excited by the newsreel camera, smiling awkwardly. I decided to reference more contemporary sources, so looked at photojournalism from Ukraine and re-created images of parents waving goodbye to their children in 2022: an adult hand over a child’s hand through the window, faces pressed to the glass. It’s only a detail but it makes the film speak subtly more to ‘now’. A new film featuring Winton’s heroic efforts and starring Sir Anthony Hopkins will be released in cinemas on New Year’s Day Today, with world news so full of conflict, it is all too easy to feel overwhelmed, to have every excuse to think it’s more than any one individual can hope to influence, that nothing you could do would make a dent in the crisis. But Winton, who died in 2015 at the age of 106, thought differently. His story is all about possibility and hope. Johnny Flynn as the young Winton in One Life Does the film work? You, the audience, will be the judge of that. But the now Dame Esther Rantzen has seen it and given us her approval – and that matters personally. You see, this director’s second ever job in the industry was as a trainee researcher on That’s Life!, so Esther was my boss. Now, decades later, I got to direct ‘her’. Perhaps more significantly, the film has been seen by both Winton’s family and some of the surviving children who first arrived at Liverpool Street Station over 84 years ago. One, Lord Dubs, wrote that he watched the film with tears streaming, because this was his life story we were telling, dramatising the moment he left his parents at Prague station. He added that when he saw Anthony Hopkins on the screen as Winton, he had to pinch himself to remember that it wasn’t the real hero he was watching. Humbly, we’ll take that. One Life will be in cinemas from 1 January *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-12881929/One-Life-film-Nicholas-Winton-Anthony-Hopkins.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "text": "> SHAH ALAM, Dec 29 — The Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah has reminded the people, especially the non-Muslims, to respect and not to interfere in matters related to Islam in the country.\nSultan Sharafuddin, who is the chairman of the National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs (MKI) made the statement in response to the call made by Beruas Member of Parliament Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham for the government to include non-Muslim experts in the Special Committee to Study the Competence of the State Legislative Assembly in Enacting Islamic Laws.\nIn a post on the Selangor Royal Office Facebook, the Sultan said MKI is entrusted with the responsibility to oversee all matters related to the Muslim community, adding that the council comprises of experts knowledgeable in various fields, particularly those involving Islamic law and religion.\nAdvertisement Therefore, he hopes that politicians, especially those who are non-Muslims, refrain from interfering in matters related to Islam.\nHe also urged followers of other religions to emulate Muslims who do not interfere in affairs of other faiths in Malaysia, quoting Surah al-Kafirun (verse 6), where Allah SWT says: “For you is your religion, and for me is my religion”.\nThe Ruler also took note of the statement issued by DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke Siew Fook.\nAdvertisement Earlier, Loke asserted that Ngeh’s proposal was a mistake and misunderstanding about the committee’s source of power, adding that DAP is committed to upholding the principle of mutual respect and harmony among religions and ethnicities. — Bernama",

    "text": "KARACHI: The demand for high speed diesel (HSD) fell 11 percent in December from the previous month, as foggy weather disrupted the transport of heavy vehicles across the country, data from the oil sector showed on Thursday.\nThe HSD consumption also declined after the sowing season for Rabi crops, which require more diesel for irrigation, ended in December.\nAccording to the oil consumption statistics of the oil sector provided to The News here on Thursday, the demand for HSD dropped by eleven percent in the country in the month of December compared to November this year.\nThe HSD consumption stood below 400,000 tonnes in the month compared to November when it was around 450,000 tonnes.\nHowever, the demand for HSD was on the higher side in the current month compared to the same month of last year. The oil sector attributed the increase in the consumption of HSD to the cut in its price in the last two successive reviews of prices, which encouraged the consumption of Pakistani diesel compared to Iranian smuggled diesel.\nOn the other hand, the consumption of petrol increased in the current month compared to the month of November this year. The petrol consumption increased by ten percent as the country consumed 425,000 tonnes of petrol in the month compared to 385,000 tonnes in the month of November this year.\nIndustry officials said the consumption of petrol rose because of the substantial reduction in the price of petrol in the last two successive reviews of petrol prices.\n\"The petrol price, which moved up to Rs331 per litre a few months back, has dropped to Rs268 per litre in the last review of the price,\" an offcial said. \"The decreasing price of petrol has increased its consumption in the country.\"\nThe sale of furnace oil has dropped massively by 33 percent in the month of December this fiscal year compared to the previous month, as power plants are not consuming it for power generation after the country witnessed low demand for electricity due to the winter season in the country.\nThe country has presently 453,000 tonnes of petrol stock, which is sufficient for 22 days, whereas there are 509,000 tonnes of HSD in the country, which are sufficient for 27 days. The country has a huge stock of 429,000 tonnes of fuel oil, which according to the oil sector is sufficient for 240 days. .\nBig investors have spent much of 2023 trying to belatedly jump on a stock market rally that few saw coming, or nursing...\nLAHORE: The country faces a deadlock on key national issues such as water management and fiscal federalism, as...\nLondon/Frankfurt/Washington: Central bankers are rethinking their approach to economic forecasting after their...\nKARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has introduced a new scheme to facilitate exports by allowing the import of input...\nKARACHI: The Pakistan Business Council , an advocacy forum of leading private sector businesses, called for lower...\nISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority has issued separate supplier licences to seven state-run...",
