    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) 'Walk alongside them': Outreach van helping Vancouver homeless cope with bitter cold The Union Gospel Mission (UGM) is working hard to make sure those experiencing homelessness have what they need during Vancouver's cold snap. UGM's mobile mission van travels throughout the Lower Mainland during the week, delivering supplies such as food, warm clothing and what Liam Beasley calls \"important conversations.\" \"I kind of describe it as 'troubleshooting' whatever comes through the door, but we go out to where people are further away from resources,” said Beasley, a community outreach worker who drives the van. “The downtown core can be a little chaotic for people, and that can be hard on people.” Beasley’s first stop of the day is in South Vancouver along the Fraser River to visit Wayne. Wayne has been experiencing homelessness for nearly 14 years. Two years ago, he says, he was living in a trailer that was towed, after being permanently set up in a parking lot. He couldn’t afford to buy it back. Beasley brings him a cup of hot chocolate and a bag of food, along with a warm pair of mittens – all items Wayne excitedly accepts. \"The food is the main thing. It's hard to get food around here because it's so expensive,” Wayne said. His shelter is reinforced by a wooden frame and tarps, and inside is a makeshift bed with a sleeping bag. \"I stay up during the night when it's the coldest but I sleep during the day when it's warmer.\" While the food and warm clothing is important, Beasley says keeping a connection with people is just as crucial. \"(We try) to build that trust, walk alongside them, no matter what they're going through, the highs the lows,” said Beasley. In December, the van served nearly 600 people throughout the Fraser Valley. \"(They're) living in these places on their own and you can understand they're fighting for survival on their own,\" said Sarah Chew, a spokesperson for UGM. \"So having someone step out and say, 'Hey, you matter and I would love to help you in any way you need,' means the world.\" UGM’s shelter is on the Downtown Eastside and has 92 beds available. So far, it’s had to turn away 59 people in January alone, due to being at capacity. Chew says the UGM is currently in desperate need of winter coats and men’s pants. Donations can be brought to their location at 601 E. Hastings St. in Vancouver.

    "text": "While the condition can impact quality of life and mental health, seeking treatment and support can make a powerful difference, says a dermatologist.\nAtopic dermatitis can lead to a challenging cycle of physical discomfort and mental stress. Photos: Sanofi, Shutterstock\nNew: You can now listen to articles.\nThis audio is generated by an AI tool.\nBrand Studio\nBrand Studio 08 Nov 2024 08:23AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Brought to you by At a time when many of her peers were enjoying social gatherings and going on dates, one young woman found herself withdrawing from the idea of romance.\n“My patient often feared that her eczema flare-ups would put off potential partners,” shared Dr Roland Chu, a consultant dermatologist at Loke Skin Clinic. “For people living with atopic dermatitis, intimacy can be challenging due to anxiety about their skin’s appearance and the fear of rejection.”\nAN ITCH THAT TAKES A TOLL\nAtopic dermatitis, or atopic eczema, is primarily caused by an unbalanced immune system that leads to inflamed, dry and itchy skin. Scratching to relieve the itch can damage the skin barrier, allowing germs and allergens to enter, which worsens the rash, itching and inflammation, creating a vicious cycle.\nThis often leads to visible skin lesions on the body, including the face and scalp, affecting social and emotional well-being and causing self-consciousness. “People dealing with this condition may also experience a decline in their ability to concentrate and perform, particularly since moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis frequently disrupts sleep,” said Dr Chu.\nAs atopic dermatitis can be triggered by factors such as heat and sweat , many patients avoid outdoor activities like picnics or beach outings with friends. Some choose to stay home rather than wear clothing like swimsuits, which reveals their skin lesions.\nHigh-stress situations can lead to heightened itching and inflammation. Stress further aggravates atopic dermatitis, activating an immune response that intensifies itching and inflammation. During high-stress periods such as preparing for examinations or meeting work deadlines, patients are more likely to experience flare-ups.\nDr Chu explained that common misconceptions about atopic dermatitis can add to one’s challenges. For example, the mistaken belief that it is contagious or brought about by poor hygiene can lead to feelings of shame and self-isolation. Similarly, seeing it as simply a sign of sensitive skin rather than a chronic inflammatory condition can undermine the lived experience, he noted.\n“Neglecting atopic dermatitis may result in a self-perpetuating itch-scratch cycle that worsens the rash and complicates treatment,” warned Dr Chu. “These misconceptions not only increase mental stress but also hinder individuals from receiving the support and treatment required for effective management.”\nIn Singapore, atopic dermatitis patients often report taking frequent medical leave , wearing long sleeves even in hot weather and waking up to bedsheets stained with blood and dead skin from scratching .\nThese challenges can take a heavy toll on mental health. A local study revealed that individuals with more severe cases of atopic dermatitis experienced higher rates of anxiety and depression . Across Asia, researchers observed that the condition negatively impacts quality of life and psychological well-being , with patients citing social embarrassment and sleep disruptions as key factors.\nINNOVATIVE THERAPIES BRING RELIEF\nAccording to Dr Chu, the most holistic approach to improving quality of life for those grappling with atopic dermatitis is a combination of medical treatment, stress management, a consistent skincare routine and lifestyle adjustments.\n“Atopic dermatitis involves complex immune responses that cannot be effectively controlled with over-the-counter creams or home remedies. Professional treatment targets the chemical signals responsible for inflammation, offering long-term symptom management,” he explained.\nConsulting with a medical professional can help individuals with atopic dermatitis explore a range of treatment options tailored to their needs. Dr Chu added that with a broad range of treatment options, including topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (a type of immunosuppressant), systemic medications and phototherapy, medical professionals can personalise treatment plans, monitor for complications and most importantly, provide patients with a renewed sense of hope.\nHe highlighted biologic therapies, which specifically target the immune pathways responsible for atopic dermatitis inflammation, as a notable breakthrough: “These therapies can result in significant improvement for patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms, offering a favourable safety and efficacy profile for long-term control of the condition.”\nWhile the chronic and unpredictable nature of atopic dermatitis can leave patients feeling frustrated and helpless, Dr Chu stressed the importance of not letting their diagnosis define them.\n“You may have to live with atopic dermatitis, but you don’t have to struggle with it,” he said. “With the right support and treatment, it’s possible to manage the condition and not let it stand in the way of achieving your goals.”\nFind out more about managing atopic dermatitis .\nRelated Topics atopic dermatitis Eczema health and wellness mental health Dermatology Advertisement RECOMMENDED Content is loading...

    "text": "The Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) is celebrating 30 years of service by paying tribute to the women and underserved minority Veterans who have served our great nation. To honor their service, we’ll be recognizing the minority Veteran recipients of the Congressional Gold Medal. Throughout the year, CMV will highlight each month with a Congressional Gold Medal awardee.\nThe Navajo Code Talkers\nVA News (previously “VAntage Point”)\nhas been writing about the Navajo Code Talkers for several years. Readers are probably aware of their influential role in World War II’s Pacific theater from 1942 to 1945, as they took part in every Marine assault (Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu, and Iwo Jima), successfully transmitting radio and telephone code messages in their native language.\nThe idea of using the Navajo’s language for radio communications was developed by Philip Johnston, son of a missionary to the Najavos and one of the few who spoke the language fluently. He was a World War I Veteran raised on a Navajo reservation with knowledge of the military’s need for a non-decipherable code. It is estimated that less than 30 non-Navajos, none of them of Japanese descent, could understand the language when the War broke out.\nIt was in early 1942 when Johnston met with Major General Clayton Vogel, commanding general of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, to discuss the value of the Navajo Code Talkers. Based on the successful testing and transmitting of messages, Vogel recommended the recruitment of 200 Navajos to the Marine Corps Commandant. The first group of Navajo recruits attended boot camp at Camp Pendleton in California, where they created the Navajo code, dictionary, and words for military terms, which they memorized during training.\nLong unrecognized because of the continued value of their language as a security classified code, the Navajo code talkers of World War II were honored for their contributions to defense on Sept. 17, 1992, at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.\nThe Congressional Gold Medal\nThe Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award given by the United States Congress, awarded to persons who have made a major and long-standing impact on American history and culture. Congress can decide to award the medal through legislative action.\nSince the American Revolution, Congress has commissioned gold medals as its highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions by individuals or institutions.\nOn July 26, 2001, the original 29 Navajo Code Talkers received the Congressional Gold Medal in ceremony at the Nation’s Capitol.\nAbout the Center for Minority Veterans\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs’ Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) was established in 1994. Under\nPublic Law 103-446, Title 38, United States Code (USC), Section 317 reflects the current the Center’s responsibilities. CMV serves as an advocate for minority Veterans and to all Veterans by conducting outreach activities to promote the awareness and use of VA benefits and services.\nA portion of this story was generated by AI. None of the data we reported included personal or sensitive information, and it was fact-checked and edited by a human copy editor prior to publishing.\nTopics in this story\nMore Stories\nVA’s Center for Minority Veterans recently hosted a fireside chat for Transgender Day of Remembrance, showcasing its commitment to inclusivity and diversity, and as a platform to discuss the challenges and triumphs of transgender Veterans.\nA personal reflection on generational service from VA Deputy Assistant Secretary Aaron Scheinberg.\nAs I reflect on Hispanic Heritage Month, I have begun to look back on the advances made by my community over the last several decades and my own experiences. My community still faces challenges.",
