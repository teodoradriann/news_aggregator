    "text": "Kamala Harris stands with the corporate democrats who are committed to austerity and imperialism. No one needs to wonder what she will do should she become president. What did Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden do? President Harris would follow in their ignoble footsteps. “People have said if you look at for example the whole, remember the whole, the heat that ended up around the bend the knee and Colin Kaepernick. Many smart people have said it actually was not a thing. The Russian bots started taking that on.” — Kamala Harris on the Breakfast Club, July 12, 2019\nVoters in the United States who feel compelled to choose between political duopoly presidential candidates are once again faced with two terrible choices. Donald Trump is the known quantity, a former president and a man of very limited intelligence. So much so that he recently confused Willie Brown with Jerry Brown . He is unsuited for anything other than what he did most of his life, promote himself as a business success when his companies filed for bankruptcy on six occasions . In 2016 he rallied white peoples’ feelings of grievance, pretended to be a champion of working people and won an electoral college vote due to his opponent’s arrogance and incompetence. When he lost the election for a second term in 2020, Trump insisted that he hadn’t and encouraged a mob to enter the Capitol and stop the electoral college election certification.\nKamala Harris is the current Vice President who stepped into the role of presidential candidate and Democratic Party nominee when Joe Biden’s physical and mental frailty became so obvious that the rich donors who put him in office decided to take him out of the race. Her campaign consists of little more than repetition of typical party talking points and a lot of good press from corporate media. In this case “good” means no journalists to speak of. The New York Times coverage consists of stories about vibes, joy, and the wonders of Kamala’s once derided laughter.\nAs a presidential candidate in 2020 she won no delegates and dropped out of the race before she could be embarrassed by a bad primary loss in her home state of California. Yet she became Biden’s running mate and ultimately vice president, a job for which she was spectacularly unsuited.\nHarris became known for having a stunning inability to speak intelligently unless she was in front of a teleprompter. When unscripted she would often blurt out that young people are very stupid or gibberish about not falling out of a coconut tree. “Everything is in context. My mother used to… she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’ You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”\nThe coconut tree line was rightly dismissed as nonsense coming from a woman who has enough self-awareness to know when she sounds silly who then laughs to cover up her discomfort. Yet the embarrassing flub has now been turned into a campaign slogan. If nothing else Harris demonstrates how the state and its partners in corporate media can work together and turn a vice president who is perceived as a joke into a credible candidate for the top job if that is what the oligarchy wants to happen.\nThe kindest thing that one can say about Harris is that she wouldn’t be the first mediocrity to become president of the United States. After all, Joe Biden was never thought of as being smart during his years in the senate and yet he became vice president and then president. He still sits in the Oval Office, and is not even in his right mind. Harris word salads and laughter at odd moments will join Reagan stammering, Bush 43 malaprops, and Trump fantasies about event crowd size as proof that anyone with the right political connections and money can in fact assume the highest office in the land.\nIt is striking that at the moment U.S. proxy Ukraine sends troops into Russia and Israel is again instigating a U.S. attack on Iran, that KamalaHarris.com says nothing about foreign policy or domestic policy either for that matter. One can donate, volunteer, and buy merchandise, but what you can’t do is find out where Harris stands on the issues.\nEventually her site will show a neo-liberal and imperialist wishlist that adds fake concern about women’s rights or voting rights or something else democrats claim to care about but don’t fight to achieve. Policy information is not shown because Harris stands for nothing but a continuation of the status quo. She is a careerist who was helped along the path of becoming a district attorney, attorney general of California, a United States Senator and then presidential candidate by rich white people. Her climb up the ladder came without ideology or serious thought on any issue.\nHow could anyone claim that the reaction to Colin Kaepernick’s very principled stance against police killings was the result of Russian bot activity? A cynical and unserious person would make such a statement. A person so shallow that she would think those words would be acceptable cannot be taken seriously as a change agent or a harm reducing “lesser evil.” If Kamala Harris becomes president it will because she avoids talking about anything that voters need or want. The whole point of buying politicians is to make sure they do not represent the people. Sometimes we end up with an intelligent person like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, and sometimes we get a lesser light intellectually. The end result is the same, immiseration at home, and death around the world.\nOne of the issues that brought Biden’s campaign to an end was public protest over the ongoing U.S./Israeli genocide in Gaza. If it continues, Harris’ shot at the white house is also in jeopardy. While in Selma, Alabama where she and other politicians go to pimp off of memories of the liberation struggle, Harris stated that she supported a six-week pause in the Gaza killing spree. “And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. This will get the hostages out and give a significant amount of aid in.”\nShe merely restated Biden administration policy. The U.S. can stop the war crimes any time it wants, instead the government pretends that a six-week pause in the fighting that it controls is a reality and not a fake effort meant to quiet discontent.\nWhen Harris was interrupted by Palestine solidarity protesters in Detroit she acted like a frustrated teacher trying to tame an unruly class. “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” The routine didn’t go over well and three days later a change in tone appeared. “I have been clear: now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done.”\nCampaign wordsmithing notwithstanding, she may as well have stuck with the first statement because she makes clear that she will not change U.S. policy towards Israel. On the same day she claimed to want a ceasefire, the Biden and Harris administration announced another tranche of aid for Israel totaling $3.5 billion with an additional $20 billion allocated the following week. In case there was any doubt where she stands, her National Security Adviser made it clear. “She does not support an arms embargo on Israel.”\nKamala Harris is an opportunist in over her head but who has decided she wants to be president. She has a history of actions and statements that speak for her. She is an establishment democratic who is beholden to the party’s donor class. Of course that is a description of every president. All one needs to do is pay attention to what they say.",

El miÃ©rcoles, el medio britÃ¡nico habÃa hecho un anuncio similar. El jueves 14 de noviembre, el diario espaÃ±ol La Vanguardia, con sede en Barcelona, comunicÃ³ que ya no publicarÃ¡ mÃ¡s contenidos en X, la plataforma de Elon Musk, a la que describe como una â€œred de desinformaciÃ³nâ€�. â€œLa antigua Twitter hace virales mensajes que atentan contra los derechos humanosâ€�, sostiene el periÃ³dico en su editorial, donde aclara que, a pesar de la decisiÃ³n, mantendrÃ¡ el seguimiento de cuentas de personalidades para â€œpoder informar puntualmente a sus lectores sobre mensajes y debates que puedan producirse en ellaâ€�. El diario agrega que desde hace tiempo sus responsables estaban preocupados por la proliferaciÃ³n en X de teorÃas conspirativas y de mensajes que desprecian los Derechos Humanos y que la cobertura de las elecciones presidenciales en Estados Unidos fue el detonante de su decisiÃ³n. Tras la elecciÃ³n de Donald Trump el 5 de noviembre, el expresidente anunciÃ³ su intenciÃ³n de nombrar a Elon Musk, director de X, al frente de una comisiÃ³n para reducir los gastos pÃºblicos, en colaboraciÃ³n con el empresario republicano Vivek Ramaswamy. â€œDesde la llegada de Elon Musk, X se ha llenado de contenido tÃ³xico y desorientador de forma cada vez mÃ¡s abrumadoraâ€�, expresÃ³ La Vanguardia en su editorial. â€œEsta red social se ha convertido en una plataforma que amplifica las teorÃas de la conspiraciÃ³n y la desinformaciÃ³nâ€�. En un artÃculo breve publicado el miÃ©rcoles, The Guardian, diario britÃ¡nico con 10,8 millones de seguidores en X, anunciÃ³ la misma decisiÃ³n. â€œCreemos que los beneficios de estar en X ahora se ven superados por los aspectos negativos y que nuestros recursos pueden usarse mejor para promover nuestro periodismo en otros lugaresâ€�, explicÃ³ el medio, aÃ±adiendo que considera a X como â€œuna plataforma tÃ³xicaâ€� y que su propietario, Elon Musk, â€œha utilizado su influencia para moldear el discurso polÃticoâ€�. Aunque The Guardian dejarÃ¡ de publicar en X, por el momento no ha decidido cerrar definitivamente su cuenta. Tampoco se ha pronunciado sobre la posibilidad de que sus periodistas sigan utilizando la red social a tÃtulo personal. No obstante, el artÃculo aclara: â€œNuestros reporteros tambiÃ©n podrÃ¡n seguir usando el sitio para recopilar noticias, de la misma forma en que utilizan otras redes sociales en las que no participamos oficialmenteâ€�. Leer tambiÃ©nTrump nombra a Elon Musk y Vivek Ramaswamy para liderar el nuevo â€˜Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamentalâ€™ Una red en constante pÃ©rdida de relevancia Estos dos periÃ³dicos no son los primeros en tomar esta decisiÃ³n. Antes, otros medios como Sveriges Radio, la radio pÃºblica sueca y los medios estadounidenses NPR y PBS decidieron distanciarse de la plataforma y dejar de publicar. Desde el 12 de abril de 2023, la cuenta oficial de NPR muestra un mensaje informando a los lectores cÃ³mo seguir su trabajo fuera de la plataforma de Elon Musk. En ese momento, cuando Musk aÃºn no habÃa mostrado abiertamente sus simpatÃas hacia Trump, el distanciamiento de los medios respondÃa a las nuevas polÃticas de etiquetado en las cuentas de medios en la red social. El propietario de Tesla, SpaceX y X nunca ha ocultado su antipatÃa hacia el mundo mediÃ¡tico. Ya en 2018, descontento con la cobertura que los medios dieron a su empresa de automÃ³viles elÃ©ctricos tras la publicaciÃ³n de una investigaciÃ³n, Musk llegÃ³ a sugerir la creaciÃ³n de un servicio de evaluaciÃ³n de medios y periodistas. Expertos entrevistados por la agencia de prensa EFE consideran que estar ahora en la red es â€œirrelevanteâ€�. De acuerdo con investigaciones del medio Le Monde, desde que Musk se convirtiÃ³ en el director de la red social, esta desconfianza se ha intensificado, tomando medidas como ralentizar el acceso a determinados sitios, cambiar el formato de los enlaces a medios de comunicaciÃ³n, responder automÃ¡ticamente a los medios con un emoji despectivo, y publicar constantemente mensajes en los que afirma que los medios tradicionales â€œmientenâ€� al pÃºblico. El miÃ©rcoles, en respuesta a un mensaje que celebraba la caÃda de audiencia de algunas cadenas de televisiÃ³n estadounidenses tras la elecciÃ³n de Donald Trump, Elon Musk respondiÃ³: â€œAhora ustedes son los mediosâ€�.",

    "text": "The great British winter weather: freezing fog, sleet and overcast grey mornings are at their most dismal during February’s 28 (or 29) days, and often seem to have no end in sight. Fortunately, while it can feel like the longest, the shortest month of the year is broken up with ideal excuses to escape for a final burst of winter sun before the welcome transition into a much milder UK spring . With a week-long half-term and – love it or hate it – Valentine’s Day , February is primed for family holidays for some far-flung fun in the sun and romantic long weekends for overseas one-on-one time. From balmy St Lucia’s white sands to sundrenched Gran Canaria and the Algarve in southern Europe , here’s our guide to finding some failsafe sunshine in February. Post- pancake day vitamin D, a tan top up close to home and the thrilling rides of Florida’s theme parks await. Read more on winter sun holidays : For mild temperatures, hiking trails and 147 miles of volcanic coastline punctuated with traditional tapas haunts, the third-largest Canary Island is a dream for vitamin D this winter. Sun-drenched Gran Canaria , known as the “miniature continent” for its versatile landscapes, offers not only parasol-peppered beaches but multiday hiking routes weaving a blanket of fertile forest and peaks of 1,950m best tackled in February’s low 20C heat. Better still, the black sands and Pico de las Nieves mountains are less than a four-and-a-half-hour flight away. Read more: Best cheap travel deals for 2024 Go to Goa this February to experience India’s capital of coastal cool with 10 hours of sunshine a day and no sign of monsoon season. The ideal antidote for the winter blues, Goa’s pocket-friendly nature extends from the opulent shoreside hotels to its deliciously diverse coconut-laced cuisine, with miles of golden beaches to stroll. Inland, the birth country of yoga welcomes Westerners to study the discipline, or tour Unesco-listed churches and the colourful chaos of Panaji if a parasailing adventure isn’t on the agenda. If you’re looking to escape to the Caribbean this winter, up to seven hours of daily sunshine and average temperature highs of 29.2C make St Lucia a hotspot for a February getaway. In fact, the island's tropical climate is at its most bearable come winter, with balmy breezes and beaming rays. The lush natural landscape is a playground for explorers looking to hike the Piton Mountains, zip wire across Pigeon Island National Park, and snorkel while topping up their tans on Sugar Beach. It’s high summer in New Zealand during the second month of the year and a dry time to experience the harbour city of Auckland’s fine wine, Lord of the Rings backdrops and the All Blacks rugby team. Bathing on Takapuna Beach meets a host of festivals, including Auckland Pride, Pasifika Festival of culture – a celebration of the Pacific Islands – and a lantern festival to ring in the Lunar New Year during February’s 28 days. Plus there are plenty of world-renowned vineyards to wine and dine in on the day of love. A family break in Orlando is one way of escaping the February gloom. With temperatures just shy of 25C and much lower humidity than the state’s sweltering summers, the Floridian city’s famed half-term havens – Disneyland and Universal – promise fun for everyone. Once you’ve had your fill of the theme parks, check out the golf courses, bargain outlet shopping and a foodie scene of Cuban sandwiches and key lime pie that’s bound to satisfy even the heartiest of appetites. Firmly in the dry season, Phuket shines in February with nine hours of daily sunshine illuminating the largest Thai isle – a great time to kick back at a whole hoard of beachside boutiques, ultra-luxurious hideaways and spa and fitness retreats that line the shores of the mountainous island. A firm favourite with holidaymakers, Phuket is a lively hub for scuba diving, Muay Thai boxing, island hopping secluded coves and, of course, sampling a taste of some culinary delights by the masters of Pad Thai. Portugal’s southern fringe maintains its mild temperatures year-round. The Algarve is primed for t-shirt weather while visitors explore the coastal town of Lagos, along with Albufeira and Portimão, while their free from crowds. Think miles of golden sand and beaches blessed with seafood spots offering sizzling sardines and cataplana fish stew or rounds of golf on one of the regions 40 manicured greens.
