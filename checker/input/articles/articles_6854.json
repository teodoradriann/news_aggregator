    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Austin leaders want to make the city more green, and on Feb. 15, they moved forward with a possible action to do so.\nA\nresolution, sponsored by Council Member Ryan Alter, was approved during the Feb. 15 council meeting to examine where leaders could find funding in order to reach the city's climate goals.\nAccording to Alter, those options could include federal funding like the Inflation Reduction Act, or it could come from a bond election that would be held in November.\nIn 2021, the council adopted the\nAustin Climate Equity plan, which included a number of strategies that would help the city achieve net-zero community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.\nAlter stressed that the resolution is a call to action to keep that promise because, \"climate change is not waiting for us to act.\"\n\"Our summers are getting hotter. Winters are becoming more severe, and we need to do more,\" said Alter. \"We are going to weigh the costs and the benefits, understanding that there is a high cost of inaction.\"\nThe funding could tackle a range of issues such as finding ways to reuse water, strengthening the power grid and helping Austinites become more sustainable in their everyday lives.\n\"If we can make a faster transition to battery electric vehicles, then we can reduce our climate impact,\" said Alter. \"Our buildings, which are one of the biggest sources, not only of our carbon emissions, but of our energy usage, are a huge opportunity for us to make an investment, for them to be more efficient and strengthen our city and our grid.\"\nNot everyone is for the plan.\nCouncil member Mackenzie Kelly pointed to the potential financial burden this could have on taxpayers.\n\"It's my job and our job as elected officials to not increase the financial burden on those who live in our city,\" said Kelly.\n\"Many questions still loom. What is the city's current bonding capacity? Can a taxpayer handle another increase? And what are the opinions of our constituencies regarding another city bond? I hope these questions are answered honestly and transparently over the coming months and that a lot of our constituencies are currently struggling financially,” Kelly reiterated.\nExecutive Dir. of Environment Texas, Luke Metzger, said he testified before the council in favor of the plan.\n\"If we don't take those steps the alternative is much bleaker,\" said Metzger. \"That federal funding is a huge opportunity, but we have to make sure that we make it as easy as possible for people to take advantage of it.\"\nMetzger, however, noted that it would ultimately be up to Austinites to make the transition in order to get the climate where it needs to be.\n\"We have to act now to reduce that pollution and move towards a clean energy economy,\" said Metzger.\nAlter said he hopes city staff will have a better idea of where they are able to invest in the coming months. Community input is expected to take place in May.",

    "text": "In recent years, several Black-American athletes have made the deeply personal decision to convert to Islam. Among them is boxing sensation Gervonta Davis, who recently announced his conversion to Islam. Gervonta Davis joins a list of notable American athletes who have converted to Islam over the years.\nIslam is one of the world’s largest faith traditions with more than 1.8 billion followers worldwide, making it the second-largest religion on the planet,\nReligion Unplugged reported.\nHere are five athletes who switched their faith.\nMuhammad Ali is perhaps the most famous athlete conversion to Islam, Ali embraced the faith in the 1960s. He changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali and used his platform to advocate for civil rights and social justice,\nReligion Unplugged reported.\nThe\nformer heavyweight champion converted to Islam in 1992 while serving time in prison. Tyson’s spiritual journey provided him with a sense of purpose during a challenging period in his life.\nThe NBA legend converted in 1968 at the age of 20. Influenced by the civil rights movement and figures like Malcolm X, Abdul-Jabbar found solace and purpose in Islam.\n“Much of my early awakening came from reading ‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X’ as a freshman. I was riveted by Malcolm’s story of how he came to realize that he was the victim of institutional racism that had imprisoned him long before he landed in an actual prison. That’s exactly how I felt: imprisoned by an image of who I was supposed to be,” Jabbar wrote in an article for\nAl-Jazeera about his faith.

Irving emphasized his commitment to Islam’s values of respect and understanding,\nAndscape reported.\nKyrie Irving converted to Islam in 2021 following an announcement that was first shared on social media by Muslim activist Dawud Walid.\n“All praise is due to God, Allah, for this,”\n he said at the time. “For me, in terms of my faith and what I believe in, being part of the Muslim community, being committed to Islam and also just being committed to all races and cultures, religions, just having an understanding and respect. I just want to put that as a foundation.”\nWorld-renowned boxer Davis, hailing from Baltimore, recently made headlines by converting to Islam in a ceremony at a Maryland mosque. Imam Hassan Abdi, who presided over the ceremony at Masjid Al-Hidaayah in Woodlawn, shared that Davis performed the shahada, the Islamic testimony of faith, and adopted the Muslim name Abdul Wahid, meaning “the servant of the one.”\nAbdi described Davis as a down-to-earth person who engaged in a meaningful conversation about striving to be the best version of oneself as a human being. Their dialogue centered on faith and personal growth, ultimately leading Davis to take the next steps in embracing Islam,\nThe Baltimore Banner reported.\nGervonta Davis, photo via Instagram, @gervontaa",
