    "text": "Readers' Favorite announces the review of the Fiction - Science Fiction book \"Virtual War\" by Ryan LeKodak, currently available at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CS2V8TLC .\nReaders' Favorite is one of the largest book review and award contest sites on the Internet. They have earned the respect of renowned publishers like Random House, Simon & Schuster, and Harper Collins, and have received the \"Best Websites for Authors\" and \"Honoring Excellence\" awards from the Association of Independent Authors. They are also fully accredited by the BBB (A+ rating), which is a rarity among Book Review and Book Award Contest companies.\n\"Reviewed By Asher Syed for Readers' Favorite\nVirtual War by Ryan LeKodak operates in both the real and virtual worlds as the crew of survivors works to confront and shut down the autonomous AI opponent, Helene, once and for all. In the virtual world, Manar adapts to the digital landscape with new capabilities. CJ also enters this realm, encountering avatars and intricate code structures to confront Helene. At Sparta Headquarters in the real world, DJ traces back Ndidi's steps to before she was taken captive by Helene. Ndidi and Bethany strategize an escape under the crush of Helene's mind influence as DJ, Hermione, and Christy start planning a rescue operation despite the belief of potential betrayal. There is confusion over who is under Helene's control and what side individuals are now on as Manar and CJ, in the virtual realm, battle bots, outdated software, shifting abilities, orbs, security constructs, the dark web, and even a bomb. Liz, Karla, Chloe, and others vacillate between multiple undertakings, all while the stakes mount and the fight takes place on these separate but intrinsically linked fronts.\nI know that sounds like a lot, but it's not even a fraction of the action and black-hat thrills that Ryan LeKodak wraps into Virtual War. I have read books one and two, which are necessary to follow exactly what is going on. It's unlikely a new reader would get far starting with book three, and they'd be robbing themselves of the build-up in the first two installments of this acclaimed series. Ndidi has been and remains the most intriguing character to me. There's a moment in the storyline where her dedication to autism research is met with a radical cure, but the ethical dilemma—to which she's no stranger—makes for an otherwise impossible internal conflict. LeKodak incorporates genre-bending non-human capabilities in the human characters operating in the virtual realm, and there are even nods toward the metaphysical, which is a fascinating construct and one that requires the courage of a skilled writer. LeKodak delivers an ending that is satisfying in how he ties up all the loose ends but also lets us know that there could, and should, be more to come. Exceptional.\"\nYou can learn more about Ryan LeKodak and \"Virtual War\" at https://readersfavorite.com/book-review/virtual-war where you can read reviews and the author’s biography, as well as connect with the author directly or through their website and social media pages.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Readers' Favorite LLC\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 800-RF-REVIEW\nCity: Louisville\nState: KY 40202\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://readersfavorite.com\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "UPDATE (6/21/24 : 3:11 p.m.) — The City of Mannford said all of the tests came back with no bacteria so the boil order was lifted at 8 p.m. on Thursday. MANNFORD, Okla. — The City of Mannford has been under a boil order since this past weekend. The City issued that order after a waterline break affected Salt Creek and a few homes on Lakeview. As of now, the City is currently testing the waters. They should know by Thursday if the boil order can be lifted. \"There were six of us that ended up making the repair Monday evening and got it done. It wasn't easy, it was hard, but we got it done,” said Jeremy Brown, the City’s gas superintendent. Last Friday, a section of a pipe under the Keystone Lake came loose, which caused a water leak. The water main crossing that’s under Keystone Lake supplies the Pelican Point Addition. \"Friday evening, there was a little water pressure in my house. I called the water guys in and said, 'hey, I think we've got a water break’,” Brown said. Brown and his crew went searching all around town looking for the water leak. Zane Timmons, gas tech with the City of Mannford, located the leak 30 feet off the shore line of the lake. Brown reached out to Salt Creek Marina for help with underwater repairs. \"He had no hesitation. He was wondering why we didn't come to him at first. He was busy, he had other things going, but he just stepped up and said yea let's go do it,\" Brown said. Brown said they were able to finish the repairs late Monday evening, but he's not sure how the waterline break happened. \"There's really nothing that we can do to predict it happening. At the end of the day, we didn't want the waterline to break and we didn't want to be out there that evening repairing it. It's in the ground, things get old and they break, unfortunately,\" Brown said. The City said those who were affected by the Pelican Point Water Outage need to boil their water until Mannford receives confirmation test results. FOX23 will continue to check on the boil water order and let you know when it's lifted.",

    "text": "First Alert 6 Weather day: Freezing drizzle spreads Friday evening, slick roads expected\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Today is a FIRST ALERT 6 WEATHER DAY due to the threat of freezing drizzle that is developing as of 3PM... it becomes more widespread as the night goes on.\nTemperatures have warmed despite the cold start and are around freezing for the metro as of 3PM and above freezing for many to the S of I-80. Despite the warm up, temperatures are expected to drop this evening as the freezing drizzle chances increase leading to ice accumulation and slick roads.\nFreezing drizzle chance will keep going up tonight with a light glaze coating things more and more after sunset.\nWidespread areas of 0.1″ of ice is what many of us can expect by the end of this event but a few spots north of I-80 could see higher amounts. Plan for only a light coating for most S of I-80 where the warmer air takes over earlier in the evening.\nWe should be able to warm just above 32 in the Metro by 1-2AM changing us over to a cold drizzle.\nThere could even be some lingering freezing rain north of I-80 to start Saturday further adding to the icing totals. We’ll warm to 36 by the afternoon and that should melt the ice.\nHighs by Sunday will be much warmer up into the 40s with hopefully a little sun breaking through.\nCopyright 2024 WOWT.

    "text": "Noite para Sir Marcus Edwards dar brilho na boa entrada do leão em 2024; Novidade? Sim... este Sporting consegue golear sem golos de Gyokeres (que fez... hat-trick de assistências); Noite perfeita do leão, que entra no novo ano cheio de saúde\nMelhor em campo - Marcus Edwards (8) Endiabrado. Um jogo para inglês (e o leão…) ver e apreciar. Vários momentos de inspiração que foram determinantes para desbloquear um adversário organizado e que chegava a Alvalade com a lição bem estudada. A cruzar, a rematar e a… marcar. Dois golos, ambos à ‘matador’ trocando os papéis com Gyokeres, que desta vez, esteve em primeiro plano a assistir. Um jogo (e exibição…) de mão cheia (e ainda uma bola no ferro) a mostrar uma das suas melhores versões do inglês esta época. Brilhante.\nAdán (6)\nTraído. Por um dos (raríssimos) lances de perigo do Estoril . Falamos, claro está, no golo de Cassiano que, mais uma vez, tem origem num pontapé de canto. O espanhol fica, porém, isento de culpas, e até então vinha a ser um espetador atento ao recital ofensivo dos leões, salvo duas ou três ameaças, as quais se opôs com tranquilidade.\nEduardo Quaresma (6)\nAplaudido. Ganhou a confiança de Rúben Amorim e das bancadas de Alvalade. Um dos mais acarinhados pelos adeptos, pela simplicidade e eficácia de processos. Provou que pode ser opção válida numa noite segura em que até tirou uma bola em cima da linha de golo (54’).\nGonçalo Inácio (7)\nImperial. Um ‘novo’ patrão na ausência de Coates . Não deu um palmo de terreno a Marqués (que corte aos 38’!), ganhou quase todos os duelos e esteve muito perto de marcar, em duas ocasiões, de cabeça (2’ e 42’). Noite perfeita do central leonino.\nMatheus Reis (6)\nImportante. Joga de olhos fechados com Nuno Santos no corredor esquerdo, entendimento que foi proporcionando vários desequilíbrios. Muito regular numa noite nivelada por cima.\nGeny Catamo (6)\nEficiente. Menos entusiasta do que outras ocasiões, é certo, mas com ações positivas nas tarefas defensivas. A fechar o corredor, atento às movimentações de Guitane (foi anulando quase sempre o franco-argelino) com competência.\nDaniel Bragança (7)\nMaduro. Rúben Amorim tem razão. A inteligência (e criatividade…) tática nunca se perderam, mas está mais consistente, a entender melhor as movimentações da equipa, sem receio do duelo. E se com bola já todos sabem da sua qualidade, sem ela está a crescer. E, dessa forma, a ganhar pontos numa posição que estará órfã de Morita nas próximas semanas.\nHjulmand (7)\nCompleto. Capaz de pautar os ritmos do jogo, de encurtar espaços, de pressionar adversários, de tornar o leão mais competente em todas as vertentes do jogo. Está um senhor jogador, bem mais criterioso no passe, como mostrou no lance do primeiro golo de Edwards , que iniciou com um lançamento perfeito do dinamarquês para a desmarcação de Gyokeres .\nNuno Santos (8)\nEletrizante. Muito ativo, sempre de dentes cerrados, a fugir da marcação de Rodrigo Gomes . Não desliga e desgasta os adversários com constantes mudanças de velocidade. Excelente assistência para Geny (26’), um chapéu que ficou curto a Carné (34’), um livre (41’) e um remate para defesa apertada (41’). E terminou estando ligado ao terceiro golo, num remate que acabou por ser desviado por Pedro Álvaro para a própria baliza (51’).\nGyokeres (8)\nSimpático. Sim… não é habitual ter este adjetivo. Mas a noite de ontem provou que o Sporting pode golear com o goleador sueco a ficar em branco. Com idêntico brilhantismo, mas a assistir. Um hat-trick de assistências! Duas para Edwards e outra, imagine-se, a ter origem num lançamento lateral que originou o autogolo de Pedro Álvaro. Terminou ainda com um primeiro passe para Trincão brilhar em mais um golo. Ficou a ‘dever’ um golo aos leões depois de se isolar (87’) mas a atirar ao lado. Poço de força, um coração inesgotável, disponibilidade tremenda.\nPedro Gonçalves (7)\nValente. A forma como se entregou ao jogo, sempre a procurar a baliza adversária, dinâmico nas movimentações. Mas a sorte (para o golo…) parece não estar com ele. Marcou, sim, mas até quando passou para o meio-campo numa arrancada perfeita até à baliza de Carné. E ainda atirou uma bola ao ferro (90+1’). Um Pedro Gonçalves diferente, menos protagonista, mas com influência enorme neste renovado Sporting .\nSuplentes Trincão (7)\nMagistral. Aquele remate, colocado com mestria, que deu o quinto golo dos leões. Uma entrada positiva, confiante deste esquerdino, que ainda assistiu Pedro Gonçalves num remate que termina no ferro (90+1’).\nLuís Neto (5)\nSeguro. Ordem para segurar e serenar a linha defensiva. Missão cumprida com sucesso.\nEssugo (5)\nCalmo. Entrou numa fase em que o jogo se encontrava mais partido, com menos critério, mas nunca perdeu o rumo e foi gerindo bem a posse, disciplinado taticamente.\nEsgaio (5)\nForte. Em algumas incursões no corredor, ambicioso, arrancando aplausos da bancada.\nPaulinho (6)\nPreparado. Poucos minutos, é certo, mas os suficientes (para um remate com perigo) a provar que pode sempre ser um acrescento à equipa.",

    "text": "Facebook Email Whatsapp Twitter La Rédaction avec AFP 25/05/2024 à 14:46 L’ancien prêtre d’Orléans a été reconnu coupable de centaines de viols et agressions sexuelles aggravées sur quatre garçons et condamné à 17 ans de réclusion criminelle, samedi par la cour d’assises du Loiret.\nL’accusé, Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, 64 ans, a été reconnu « coupable de l’ensemble des faits de viols et agressions sexuelles aggravées », a déclaré la cour. Elle a annoncé une période de sûreté de 10 ans qui va au-delà des réquisitions de l’avocat général.\nPublicité La veille, devant une salle interdite et suspendue à ses paroles, l’ancien prêtre - renvoyé à l’état laïc à sa demande - a « reconnu tout sans réserve ».\nLa suite après cette publicité « Je reconnais, puisqu’il faut utiliser les mots, les attouchements, les caresses, les fellations, les pénétrations digitales et péniennes, l’ensemble des faits », a-t-il déclaré.\nLa suite après cette publicité Suivant les réquisitions, la cour a également condamné l’accusé à un « suivi sociojudiciaire », « une injonction de soins », « l’interdiction d’exercer toute activité professionnelle ou bénévole impliquant un contact avec des mineurs », entre autres.\n« Ce qui est frappant c’est que les actes, les noms (des victimes) font masse », avait déploré l’avocat général.\nLa suite après cette publicité La suite après cette publicité Dans un rare exercice de confessions vendredi, l’accusé a également avoué, pour la première fois, des viols et agressions sexuelles sur deux autres victimes dès 1982 - des faits qui n’ont pu être jugés en raison de la prescription.\nSamedi matin, son conseil, Me Damien Brossier, a appelé la cour à la mansuétude soulignant que son client « n’est plus un danger », et qu'« on en peut pas être condamné à 64 ans comme à 37 ans, l’âge est passé, l’usure est passée et du temps s’est écoulé sans infraction » depuis les faits condamnés.\n« La gangrène » Les faits jugés remontent aux années 1990 et 2000 lorsque Olivier de Scitivaux de Greische, ordonné prêtre en 1989, se lie aux parents de ses victimes, une fratrie de trois, s’invitant régulièrement à leur table, restant dormir dans la chambre de l’aîné, qui sera agressé et violé dès ses 9 ans.\n« La gangrène, c’est Olivier de Scitivaux parce qu’il s’est introduit partout dans la famille », a dénoncé l’avocate d’une des victimes, Me Clémence Lemarchand.\nÀ leur domicile, pendant que les parents dorment au rez-de-chaussée, dans les demeures somptueuses de la famille Scitivaux, l’hiver au chalet à Abondance (Haute-Savoie) ou l’été en colonie de vacances à Perros-Guirec (Côtes-d’Armor), celui qui avait à l’époque 22 à 25 ans de plus que les victimes (âgées de 7 à 9 ans) va leur infliger des violences.\nDevant une salle d’audience comble, dans laquelle de nombreux responsables de l’Église catholique et paroissiens ont pris place depuis mardi, les trois frères et un ami ont raconté à tour de rôle, avec minutie et pudeur, les sévices qu’ils recevaient chacun leur tour, sans savoir que les autres étaient également victimes.\n« Quand il n’y en avait pas un de disponible, il y avait le deuxième ou le troisième », a confirmé l’ancien prêtre, désignant ainsi les trois frères, des quadragénaires aujourd’hui unis sur le banc des victimes.\n« Regardez bien ses mains », a invectivé le cadet de la fratrie, « ce sont dans ses mains que j’ai éjaculé la première fois, ce sont ses mains qui donnent l’eucharistie ».\nLe benjamin a lui raconté, devant une cour interdite, ces quelques mois où il « y pass (ait) toutes les semaines, tous les jours, tous les soirs », « le moment où il a utilisé des outils sur mon corps » ou lorsqu'« il m’a rasé ».\nLes faits se sont produits jusqu’au début des années 2000. Pourtant, les premières alertes sont émises par des animateurs et familles auprès du diocèse dès les années 80, des familles ou des animatrices de l’aumônerie en 1998. En vain.\nL’Église catholique est depuis des années secouée par des scandales de pédocriminalité dans le monde entier, et régulièrement accusée de fermer les yeux sur eux et d’ignorer les victimes. En France, un rapport rendu en octobre 2021 estime qu’en 70 ans, environ 330.000 personnes ont été agressées au sein de l’Eglise lorsqu’elles étaient mineures.\nPublicité Contenus sponsorisés Sur le même sujet Société Viols et agressions sexuelles : l’ancien prêtre d’Orléans condamné à 17 ans de réclusion\nSociété Nouvelle-Calédonie : de premiers Français évacués, un septième mort\nSociété Saint-Pierre-des-Chartreux : À chœur vaillant\nSociété Cauet mis en examen pour viols et agression sexuelle : ce que l’on sait des plaignantes\nSociété Carlo Acutis, un ado de 15 ans, va devenir le premier Saint mort au 21e siècle\nSociété Pèlerinage de Chartres : au printemps de la foi\nSociété Nouvelle-Calédonie : une histoire marquée par la violence\nPublicité Publicité",

    "title": "API (In)security: The Hidden Risk of Black Friday",
    "text": "Black Friday may be the pinnacle of the holiday shopping season, a day when online retailers experience unprecedented traffic and revenue opportunities as consumers kick off the Christmas season. For many retailers, it’s a make-or-break event. Yet, with increased traffic comes increased risk, particularly as it relates to cybersecurity and keeping shoppers safe from fraud stemming from a cyberattack on their favorite digital store. An area often overlooked in the frenzy to prepare for this critical shopping day is API security.\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as the facilitator of modern e-commerce operations, connecting mobile apps, websites, and backend systems to enable seamless shopping experiences. Retailers are particularly vulnerable as they rely heavily on APIs to handle user authentication, manage inventories, facilitate payment processing, and integrate third-party services like logistics or marketing tools. A compromised API can lead to significant losses, from leaked customer data to financial fraud and disrupted operations.\nWhile APIs offer unparalleled convenience and scalability, they also present a lucrative attack vector for cybercriminals. There’s no doubt that neglecting API security during Black Friday preparations could have possibly disastrous consequences for retailers.\nSecurity vs. Speed The harsh reality is that, for many organizations, application security posture takes a back seat to the need to develop and deploy quickly. As Black Friday approaches, the pressure to deliver new features, scale infrastructure, and ensure uptime often leads to shortcuts in security practices.\nWhile speed-to-market is essential, failing to prioritize security can lead to devastating breaches. Cybercriminals are well aware of the vulnerabilities created by this rush and often exploit them during high-traffic events. For example, APIs without proper authentication or rate-limiting mechanisms can be targeted for account takeovers, data theft, or denial-of-service attacks. All of which can be detrimental if you’re an online retailer during the busiest shopping day of the year.\nAnd the stakes are high. The consequences of an API breach during Black Friday can be severe. A successful attack can lead to revenue loss, customer trust erosion and operational disruption which can be difficult to recover from.\nCommon API Security Pitfalls Retailers must recognize and address the security deficiencies that can arise at every stage of API development and deployment, including:\nDevelopment Errors: Insecure coding practices, such as hardcoding sensitive credentials or failing to sanitize inputs, can leave APIs vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Inadequate Architecture Designs: Poorly designed APIs may expose unnecessary endpoints or fail to implement the principle of least privilege, increasing the attack surface. Misconfigurations: Misconfigured access controls, encryption settings, or logging mechanisms can inadvertently open the door to unauthorized users or make it difficult to detect malicious activity. Lack of Runtime Protections: APIs deployed in production without adequate defense mechanisms, such as firewalls or anomaly detection systems, are sitting ducks for opportunistic attackers. Posture Governance: The Missing Piece A well-thought-out API posture governance program is critical to ensuring security without sacrificing agility. Such a program aligns developers, architects, and DevSecOps teams with regulatory compliance, best practices, and corporate standards throughout the application lifecycle. Unfortunately, many organizations still lack this maturity in their security strategies.\nRecent security incidents, such as Peleton and T-Mobile , have revealed significant gaps in posture governance. Many retailers have embraced modernization and microservices architectures without embedding proper security controls into their development lifecycles. In some cases, they haven’t even documented corporate security posture standards. This lack of foresight leaves organizations scrambling to backtrack and address vulnerabilities, often with limited time before critical events like Black Friday.\nEmbedding Security Without Compromising Innovation The challenge for retailers is to embed security posture controls into their application lifecycles without stifling innovation. This requires a proactive approach that includes:\nAutomated Security Testing: Integrating tools for API vulnerability scanning and penetration testing into CI/CD pipelines ensures that security issues are identified and addressed early. Continuous Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of API traffic can help detect and mitigate threats before they escalate. Education and Collaboration: Ensuring that all stakeholders, from developers to executives, understand the importance of API security fosters a culture of shared responsibility. For online retailers, Black Friday represents both a lucrative opportunity and a significant cybersecurity challenge. APIs, while critical for enabling scalable and efficient e-commerce operations, also present a prime target for attackers if not properly secured. By prioritizing API security and adopting robust posture governance practices, retailers can safeguard their systems, protect customer trust, and ensure a successful shopping season. After all, the cost of prevention is always less than the price of recovery.\nTo find out how Salt can help you prioritize your riskiest APIs, get in touch to schedule a demo .\n‍\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Salt Security blog authored by Eric Schwake .
