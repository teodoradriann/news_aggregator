    "text": "Secciones Servicios Destacamos Costa Teguise Viernes, 5 de julio 2024, 13:44 Necesitas ser registrado para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Opciones para compartir Una presentación atípica en el nuevo Centro Cívico de Costa Teguise sirvió este viernes para dejar constancia de que desde el lunes de 1 de julio está en vigor el nuevo contrato de servicio de limpieza y recogida de residuos en el municipio de Teguise. La iniciativa se ha cedido por tres años a PreZero España, por un importe próximo a 9,6 millones de euros, confirmándose lo avanzado meses atrás por CANARIAS7. Al concurso público optaron cuatro empresas. Con el nuevo contrato se espera dar un salto de calidad, dio a entender la alcaldesa, Olivia Duque, en la presentación en sociedad. Para tal consecuencia se confía en que se amplía el personal en servicio, pues de 32 profesionales se pasa a 42; y con mayor cantidad de horas de trabajo. En cuanto a medios materiales, se ha definido una estrategia para ir ampliando la flota de vehículos, así como el mobiliario destinado a facilitar que los ciudadanos depositen los restos. Con parte del nuevo parque móvil en la isla; como se detalló a este diario por Sergio Cabellos, representante de PreZero España; y Matuli Rodríguez Borges, la funcionaria encargada de supervisar la parte técnica del contrato, se trabajará de modo cotidiano con cinco barredoras, un par de camiones para enseres, cuatro vehículos para personal, un lavacontenedores, varios furgones limpiadores y media docena de camiones para la recogida. Y con la particularidad de que se ha previsto la necesidad de emplear camiones de recogida trasera, para optimizar recursos en los 24 pagos del municipio. En cuanto a recipientes, durante los próximos meses irá teniendo lugar un proceso de renovación y ampliación del parque de contenedores. La adjudicataria se ha comprometido a emplear 1.260 contenedores de estreno, con el escudo municipal. E igualmente se dará trato preferente al reparto de contenedores marrones, los que servirán para el depósito de residuos orgánicos, siendo Teguise territorio de referencia en Lanzarote. Se colocarán 85 recipientes de este quinto contenedor de gran capacidad y medio millar de contenedores de volumen menor. En la presentación estuvieron Domingo Cejas, consejero insular de Residuos; y Ángel Pablo Montañés, del Ejecutivo canario.

    "text": "3 hours ago User-posted content NJDOL Assesses New Brunswick Landscaping Company $38K in Back Wages to Five Workers. Photo by Morristown Minute VLD Landscaping L.L.C. was cited for multiple labor law violations, including failure to pay overtime and improper employee classification. NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. - The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL) has ordered VLD Landscaping L.L.C. of New Brunswick to pay $38,055.83 in back wages, penalties, and fees after an investigation by the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance uncovered several labor law violations affecting five employees.\nThe violations included failing to pay overtime, improper record keeping, unpaid or late payment of wages, violations related to Earned Sick Leave records, and misclassification of employees. The total assessment includes $28,927.50 in unpaid overtime, a 5% misclassification penalty of $9,128.33, and $22,555.58 in penalties and administrative fees.\n“ These violations serve as a stark reminder of why New Jersey’s labor laws exist, and this department will not tolerate any dishonest actions that undermine them ,” said Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo . “ Our state continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to ensuring the fair treatment of workers, and NJDOL will hold violators accountable to the fullest extent of the law .” The investigation was initiated following a complaint filed by the advocacy group New Labor on behalf of the five affected workers. During the investigation, it was revealed that VLD Landscaping paid its workers in cash without proper deductions, and employees worked only two to three days a week. The company's owner, Israel Ramirez Lopez, was unable to provide the necessary documentation when subpoenaed to appear at NJDOL headquarters in Trenton.\nThe NJDOL’s findings underscore the importance of compliance with state labor laws, which are designed to protect workers' rights and ensure fair compensation. The owner of VLD Landscaping was provided with New Jersey’s Employer’s Guide to Wage and Hour Laws to help prevent future violations.\nThe work conducted by VLD Landscaping involved routine lawn maintenance on commercial and residential properties. The NJDOL’s action serves as a reminder that all employers must adhere to labor laws, including proper wage payment and classification practices.\nFor more information on worker benefits and protections, visit myworkrights.nj.gov .\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!

The last thing I want to express is my love for the black and brown community, I grew up with all my black and brown folks… I got nothing but love for them, I ain’t never faking,’ he said.\nYang said he was always positive about black people to his Chinese friends and the song had nothing to do with ‘creating division’ between the two communities.\nHe didn’t entirely back down as he added a poll asking if politicians should be ‘held accountable for the decay and failing of the city’.\nYang recently suffered a heart attack and said as a result he wasn’t up to dealing with the escalating fallout from his video.\nYang was earlier singing a different tune, staying defiant despite backlash from the mayor’s supporters and a rally planned by former mayor Willie Brown and local NAACP president Reverend Amos Brown.\n‘I’m fed up with crime and incompetent city officials, so if they don’t care about us, it is up to us to take a stand and exercise our constitutional rights,’ he said in one video.\nHe showed a handwritten sign on the door of his restaurant Kung Food that told would-be burglars that there was no cash to steal.\n‘We ain’t got no more money in the cash register. Those tablets ain’t worth much! Who’s got money under Joe’s economy, come on, partner!’ it read.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by ChinoYang(杨晓川） (@chinoyang415)\nYang was earlier singing a different tune, staying defiant despite backlash from the mayor’s supporters with follow up videos doubling down on his criticism\nYang showed a handwritten sign on the door of his restaurant Kung Food that told would-be burglars that there was no cash to steal\nYang wrote next to the video: ‘Make San Francisco Great Again!
