    "text": "(DP) Outlaw rocker Jesse Dayton is having an action-packed fall with a host of exciting projects, including an exclusive interview with Steve Earle airing on SiriusXM Outlaw Country this Saturday, September 28th at 9PM EST, his ongoing Road to Redemption tour, and a much-anticipated role as the opening act for Tab Benoit on his I Hear Thunder tour this December. Benoit's new album, which just hit #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart this week, is fueling excitement for their upcoming tour. Dayton's high-octane performances, combined with these recent milestones, have made him one of the most talked-about artists in outlaw country and blues right now. Jesse Dayton's Insightful Interview with Steve Earle Airs This Saturday - Jesse Dayton and Steve Earle sat down for a rare, in-depth interview that will air on SiriusXM Outlaw Country this Saturday, September 21st at 9 PM ET. The two artists, who share deep Texas roots, reflected on their careers and the musical traditions that shaped their work. For Jesse, this interview was a full-circle moment, recalling how he first saw Steve's rockabilly band perform at Antone's in Texas as a teenager and later became one of only three artists-alongside Earle and Lucinda Williams-to perform on all nine Outlaw Country Cruises. \"The interview we did on Steve's show is probably one of the more insightful conversations I've ever had,\" Dayton says. \"Steve knows the part of Texas I grew up in like the back of his hand. We talked about everything from oil rig workers blasting blues and honky tonk music, to our time around Townes Van Zandt, to the TV and film projects we've both been involved with over the years.\" The interview also hinted at possible future collaborations between Dayton and Earle. For fans of both artists, this conversation is a can't-miss event, offering a rare glimpse into the rich history of the outlaw country scene.

The tour continues through October, with Dayton teasing new collaborations and special Road Kings holiday shows set to be announced soon.to the Stage Opening for Tab Benoit on the \"I Hear Thunder\" Tour This December, Jesse Dayton will join blues legend Tab Benoit on his I Hear Thunder tour. Fresh off the release of his first new album in 13 years, Benoit's record has just reached #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart, solidifying him as one of the most respected figures in contemporary blues. Dayton, who will serve as the opening act for the tour, is excited to bring his own brand of outlaw blues to the stage alongside Benoit. \"Tab's new album is absolutely incredible, and it's an honor to be a part of this tour,\" Dayton says. \"We're going to bring it every night, and I can't wait to see how these shows unfold.\" The I Hear Thunder tour is expected to be a major highlight for blues and guitar fans, featuring Dayton's gritty energy and Benoit's signature soulful performances.

    "title": "Vinyl Records Had One Of Its Best Sales Weeks In December—Largely Boosted By Taylor Swift",
    "text": "Topline More than 2 million vinyl records were sold in the United States in the week ending Dec. 21, the third-largest week for vinyls since 1991, Billboard reported , largely propelled by Taylor Swift, who has led the revitalization of vinyl sales in recent years.\nKey Facts There were 2.054 million vinyl albums sold during the week leading up to Christmas ranking only behind the weeks before Christmas in 2022 and 2021, which logged 2.232 million and 2.115 million vinyls sold each.\nTaylor Swift’s “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” was the best-selling album of the week with 57,000 copies sold, and according to Billboard’s vinyl sales chart , Swift had the top four vinyls of the week and six of the top seven albums.\nSwift alone made up nearly 10% of the vinyl sales for the week ending Dec. 21, Billboard reported .\nThe only non-Taylor Swift artist in the top seven of Billboard’s vinyl sales chart is Olivia Rodrigo, whose album “GUTS” ranks fifth.\nSwift also led U.K. vinyl sales to its biggest-ever year in 2023, with “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” ranking as the year’s best-selling vinyl album and “Midnights” and “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” also ranking in the top 10.\nSwift has sold 2.484 million vinyls in the United States as of Nov. 2, nearly five times as many as Lana Del Rey, the second best-selling vinyl artist of 2023, and meaning about one in every 15 vinyl purchases was a Swift album, Billboard reported .\nKey Background Vinyl sales have been on the rise in recent years and Swift has led the charge, setting plenty of records for vinyl sales. In 2022, her “Midnights” was the year’s best-selling vinyl album with nearly 1 million copies sold, almost double the amount of Harry Styles’ “Harry’s House,” the second-most-popular vinyl album that year. With “Midnights,” Swift broke the record for the biggest sales week for a vinyl album with 575,000 copies sold—a record she broke again this year when “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” sold 580,000 vinyl records in its debut week. Swift has often encouraged her fans to buy vinyl records: In 2022, she served as the ambassador for Record Store Day, observed by independent record stores to celebrate sales of CDs and vinyls. In a statement for Record Store Day, Swift said it has been a “true joy for me to watch vinyl sales grow in the past few years.” For “Midnights,” Swift sold four vinyl editions of the album that form a clock when mounted together on a wall, and for “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” she sold vinyls in four different colors.\nTangent Billy Field, vice president of sales and a vinyl strategist at Warner Music Group, told CNBC vinyl sales are rising because they’re “eternally cool” and are an example of “labels’ and artists’ continued focus on the fan connection via collectible, bespoke offerings.” CNBC reported retailers like Walmart and Target began stocking vinyls in the 2010s, which helped boost sales, and many consumers began to reconnect with vinyl records during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nCrucial Quote “When Taylor releases a new record, there may be eight, nine, 10, different variants of that same record — different colors, different combinations, maybe there’s some unique tracks that weren’t included on the digital release, or the CD, but you get it on the vinyl,” Mark Michaels, CEO and chairman of United Record Pressing, told CNBC. “There’s a lot of fans that say, ‘There are eight different variants. I want one of each, please.’ They’re very supportive.”\nSurprising Fact About half of consumers who purchased a vinyl record within the past year don’t own a record player, according to a study conducted earlier this year by Luminate, a company that tracks music sales.\nBig Number 17. That’s how many consecutive years vinyl sales have risen in the United States, with the format finally overtaking CD sales in 2022 for the first time since 1987.\nFurther Reading Taylor Swift Has Sold Nearly One Out of Every 15 Vinyl Albums in the U.S. This Year (Billboard)\nU.S. Vinyl Album Sales Rise for 17th Straight Year — But Growth Is Slowing (Billboard)\nTaylor Swift’s ‘1989 (Taylor’s Version)’ Breaks Modern-Era Single-Week Vinyl Sales Record (Billboard)\nConor Murray",

    "title": "\"Tell the manager I was a little ticked off that they didn't give me a look\" - Sprewell told Ewing how badly he wanted to join the Knicks",
    "text": "By John Jefferson Tan ,\n1 hour ago\nLatrell Sprewell was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 1992, but he had long admired the New York Knicks. Like most players at the time, Spree also yearned to be a part of the storied franchise, and he thought the Knicks would be interested in him during his first free agency in 1996.\nAt the time, Sprewell was emerging as one of the NBA's most explosive scorers. As he hit free agency, Latrell had a vision of playing alongside Patrick Ewing , but the Knicks never recruited him and opted to sign Allan Houston instead. To this day, Spree still vividly recalls how he approached Ewing about it.\n\"I actually told Patrick, when I was with the Warriors, and I was a free agent, and now the Knicks didn't pick me up, and Allan [Houston] was a free agent too, so, it was Allan and myself. I'm thinking I want to go to the Knicks,\" Sprewell told MSG AM in 2020.\n\"I hope they give me a look, and they didn't,\" he continued. \"So, I saw Patrick the next game I played, and I went up to him, and I said, 'Hey, man, you tell the manager that I was a little ticked off that they didn't give me a look.' I really want to be a Knick at that point.\"\nThe Knicks eventually signed Spree Sprewell moved on and spent two more seasons with the Warriors. However, an infamous physical altercation with his coach saw him being dealt out of the team.\nThough Spree did not wish to leave Golden State that way, it was a stroke of luck that he was traded to the Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills, and Terry Cummings. Looking back, Sprewell believes Ewing played a role in it.\n\"Patrick looked out for me… I think that's one of the reasons why they went out there and [recruited me] when I was suspended… I think that's one of the reasons they did that and made that move,\" the four-time All-Star reflected.\nSpree enjoyed his time with Big Pat and the Knicks Unsurprisingly, a 6'5\" guard's tenure with the Knicks remains a significant chapter in his NBA career. In retrospect, Spree acknowledged how Ewing provided stability and guidance as a leader, which was crucial for the Knicks at the time.\nFor Latrell, \"Big Pat\" was not only a dominant force on the court but also a mentor who led by example and inspired his younger teammates.\n\"I loved it, every minute of it. Patrick is, he's a leader for our team. He was always one of the guys that put in extra work after practice, like myself, and you just got to appreciate everything he went through at Georgetown and just all the stuff he did with the Knicks. So, it was a lot of fun, man, I appreciate it,\" Sprewell said.\nFrom underdogs to title contenders The environment in New York empowered Sprewell to elevate his game even more and assume a larger role within the team's framework. The mutual respect between him and Ewing was palpable, as they recognized each other's strengths and understood the importance of teamwork.\nIt didn't take Sprewell long to get accustomed to the Knicks' playing style. His presence was quickly felt in his debut season with the team, helping New York secure the eighth seed in the 1999 playoffs.\nIn the postseason, it became apparent that Spree's addition to the Knicks was pivotal to their championship aspirations. Along with Ewing, Sprewell and the Knicks beat the odds, upsetting the first-seeded Miami Heat and advancing all the way to the Finals.\nRelated: \"If it was that negative, it's just disappointing\" - Joel Embiid reacts to Gilbert Arenas' xenophobic rant\nThe Knicks fought without Ewing in the Finals Unfortunately, there was some collateral damage along the way. \"Big Pat\" got hurt in the middle of the Eastern Conference Finals, forcing Ewing to sit the remainder of the series, including the entire Finals.\nWithout Ewing, the Knicks struggled to match the San Antonio Spurs' \"Twin Towers,\" Tim Duncan and David Robinson. Sprewell did his best and stepped up in the legendary big man's absence, but his efforts weren't enough to dismantle the Spurs.\n\"Going against David Robinson and Tim Duncan, we needed Patrick,\" Sprewell once confided. \"We were at a disadvantage; that's the one thing that sticks out for me, which is wondering what those finals would've been like if we had Patrick. I still think about it.\"\nIndeed, Sprewell's arrival in New York brought a unique blend of talent, tenacity, and charisma to a team that was on the cusp of accomplishing something big. It’s safe to say it was also fitting that his style and attitude complemented Ewing's approach to the game. Spree may not have won an NBA championship with the Knicks, but his synergy with Ewing made his stint memorable.\nRelated: \"Iron sharpens iron\" - Reggie Miller pays tribute to his rivalry and friendship with Patrick Ewing\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

DeGroote Updated Jul 25, 2024 at 9:41pm Getty Images The Cleveland Browns are already dealing with injuries to key players, including Greg Newsome and Dalvin Tomlinson.\nThe Cleveland Browns will be without cornerback Greg Newsome for a chunk of training camp and potentially the start of the season as he recovers from hamstring surgery.\nNewsome injured his hamstring during a workout away from the facility. The Browns put Newsome on the non-football injury list before camp and provided some more details on Thursday, July 25.\n“Hopefully have (Newsome) back for Week 1 but I’ll have more of an update as we get closer,” Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said .\nThe Browns started training camp this week at The Greenbrier in West Virginia. Cleveland star cornerback Denzel Ward said that Newsome’s presence has been missed.\n“Yeah, man, it hurt,” Ward said . “Greg’s a big energy guy for the team, a leader for this team and a great player out there on the field, so we’re just looking forward to getting him back as soon as possible, but just wishing him the best. But yeah, it definitely, definitely hurt though, him being out.”",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power in wake of Storm Gerrit The Met Office confirmed the worst of the conditions passed. Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren - SaskToday.ca",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.
