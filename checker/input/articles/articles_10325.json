    "text": "La Fiscalía de Durazno imputó por intento de homicidio y porte de armas de fuego al hombre de 27 años que baleó a\nValentina, una joven de 20 años, en la entrada de un baile de la localidad en la madrugada de Navidad.\nEl hombre fue detenido este miércoles y estará en prisión preventiva durante 180 días.\nPor su parte, los otros tres detenidos no fueron imputados por este hecho pero continúan en detención por otro caso en el que son sospechosos de haber herido de bala a dos personas el 23 de diciembre.\nEl hecho, que terminó en la bala perdida, ocurrió a la salida de un local bailable ubicado en el paraje La Curva de la Ruta 14, al sur de la ciudad de Durazno, según informó Telemundo. Sobre las 2:00 de la madrugada del lunes 25 de diciembre se sintieron varios disparos, que desde las autoridades creen se debieron a un enfrentamiento entre dos grupos de hombres, y una de las balas impactó en Valentina, que era ajena a a los hechos.\nUna amiga de la joven comunicó por Instagram que estaba haciendo la fila junto a ella cuando comenzaron a sentir disparos y gritos en los que le pedían a las personas que se tiraran \"al piso\". En ese momento vieron que Valentina estaba tirada en el piso con un balazo en la cabeza. Posteriormente la trasladaron a un hospital de Montevideo, donde permanece en CTI.\nEste jueves al mediodía se realizó una multitudinaria marcha \"por la seguridad\" en Durazno. Los participantes se movilizaron desde la Plaza Sarandí hasta el Juzgado de la capital departamental para manifestar su \"compromiso con la seguridad de Durazno\", como indicaron los organizadores en una carta pública.\n\"Durazno fue nuestro refugio, un lugar donde la tranquilidad era una constante en nuestras vidas. Sin embargo, hoy nos encontramos ante una realidad desafiante: el miedo ha invadido nuestras calles\", lamentaron en la carta publicada días atrás.\nEl jefe de Policía de Durazno, Germán Suárez, aseguró a los manifestantes de la multitudinaria marcha que los problemas de inseguridad en la zona vienen de \"hace 20 años\", y lamentó lo que le sucedió a Valentina.\n\"Esta enfermedad hace 20 años que empezó acá. A toda esta mierda que hay en la sociedad la estamos combatiendo. Precisamos de la colaboración de todos. Lamentablemente termina pagando una persona inocente como Valentina\", expresó Suárez, en una conversación con algunos de los manifestantes que fue grabada por Radio Yi (960 Am).",

    "text": "Arsenal have announced their star-studded squad for the new league phase of the 2024/25\nChampions League, aiming to go deep in this season’s competition.\nAfter a memorable last-16 penalty shootout win over Porto and an agonising 3-2 aggregate loss to German giants\nBayern Munchen, the Gunners will be hoping to rewrite history and announce themselves as one of the main contenders for this year's title.\n-\nWho has made the squad?\nSurprise inclusions for\nMikel Arteta’s side include Kieran Tierney as part of the defensive unit. The Scottish international has only just returned to the training pitch after suffering a hamstring injury at the Euro 2024 this summer. England youth international, Tommy Setford, is also part of List A alongside new signing Neto.\nOther summer signings that will be hoping to make their Arsenal\nChampions League debuts are Italy’s Euro 2024 breakout star, Riccardo Calafiori, Euro 2024 winner, Mikel Merino, and the on-loan Raheem Sterling from Chelsea.\nTwo separate lists can be submitted to make up the squad for the\nChampions League - A and B.\nList A consists of 25 players, two must be goalkeepers and eight must be ‘locally trained players’.\nA locally trained player is someone who has been club-trained on Arsenal’s books for three whole seasons or 26 months between the ages of 15 and 21.\nOr, association-trained players who were on another club's books in the same association for three whole seasons of 36 months between the ages of 15 and 21.\n-\nList A in full:\nGoalkeepers:\nDavid Raya, Neto and https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/07/15/arsenal/1188439-arsenal-confirm-tommy-setford-signing-from-ajax.html\nDefenders:\nBen White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Jurrien Timber, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Jakub Kiwior, Riccardo Calafiori, Takehiro Tomiyasu and https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/06/24/arsenal/1186247-how-arsenals-players-fared-in-matchday-three-at-euro-2024.html\nMidfielders:\nThomas Partey, Martin Odegaard, Jorginho, https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/13/arsenal/1192455-what-arsenal-need-in-the-final-weeks-of-the-transfer-window.html and Declan Rice\nForwards:\nBukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Kai Havertz and https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2023/05/02/arsenal/1145635-arsenal-vs-chelsea-premier-league-preview-gameweek-34-2023.html\nList A can be altered if Arsenal make the round of 16 in February 2025 and they will be able to register a further three players who may be new signings or players returning from injury. However, the rule of a maximum of 25 players with at least eight locally trained players remains.\n-\nWhere are the\nHale Endyouth stars?\nThere is no place for standout youth players such as\nEthan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in List A because UEFA allows under-21 players to be chosen on List B no later than 00:00 CET on the night before each match of the competition.\nA player can be included in List B if they are born on, or after, January 1st 2003 and have been eligible to play for two years since their 15th birthday.\nArteta can choose an unlimited number of under-21 players for his\nChampions League squads depending on their availability, meaning that we are likely to see the likes of Nwaneri, Lewis-Skelly, Ayden Heaven and Josh Nichols as part of the squad at some point in the season.\n-\nWho will Arsenal face in the new league phase?\nAs there is now one whole league for the\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/07/arsenal/1191638-time-to-turn-success-into-silverware-arsenal-season-preview-202425.html instead of separate groups, each team will play eight games to see if they can make it to the last 16.\nArsenal will play four home games and four away games and if they finish in the top eight then they will reach the knockout rounds automatically.\nWho Arsenal will face\nWith Arsenal being drawn out of pot 2 they will face some of Europe’s finest in the early stages of the competition. This includes a home tie against\nLuis Enrique’s Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and an away tie at Inter, where the Gunners famously won 1-5 over 20 years ago.\nThere are also some tricky away opponents in\nAtalanta and Girona where Arteta’s side will have to deal with some thunderous atmospheres to take away all three points.\nArsenal’s opponent list in full:\nAtalanta (A) - Thursday 19 September 2024, 20:00 BST\nPSG (H) - Tuesday 1 October 2024, 20:00 BST\nShakhtar Donetsk (H) - Tuesday 22 October 2024, 20:00 BST https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2021/07/21/arsenal/1078854-why-arsenal-pulled-out-of-the-florida-cup.html (A) - Wednesday 6 November 2024, 20:00 GMT Sporting (A) - Tuesday 26 November 2024, 20:00 GMT Monaco (H) - Wednesday 11 December 2024, 20:00 GMT\nDinamo Zagreb (H) - Wedesnday 22 January 2025, 20:00 GMT\nGirona (A) - Wednesday 29 January 2025, 20:00 GMT",

    "title": "Will northern lights be visible again tonight in Arizona?",
    "text": "Will northern lights be visible again tonight in Arizona? The northern lights were visible across Arizona on Thursday night, with people capturing photos of the rare phenomenon from Flagstaff to southern Tucson. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center reported that a coronal mass ejection occurred on October 8, when solar material and magnetic fields erupted. This triggered a geomagnetic storm, which reached Earth on Thursday, making the aurora borealis visible in parts of the country. Although NOAA predicted the aurora would be visible as far south as northern Utah on Thursday night, [some Arizonans](https://www.azcentral.com/picture-gallery/news/local/arizona/2024/10/11/northern-lights-visible-in-arizona/75627200007/) in areas with low light pollution were able to catch a glimpse. Many residents shared the rare sight of pink and purple beams over the desert skies on social media. \"What a magical night!,\" one user posted with a timelapse video of the lights as seen just outside of Tucson. Here's the science behind this charming sky phenomenon, and when Arizona residents may be able to see it again. What is a geomagnetic storm? Why were northern lights visible so far south? A geomagnetic storm is a disturbance in Earth's protective magnetic field caused by solar flares unleashing coronal mass ejections toward Earth. When large enough, these plasma eruptions from the sun's corona can cause the aurora borealis to be visible further south. Thursday's storm was a category four out of five, considered severe and uncommon, according to Dahl. However, there have been five category 4 or higher storms in the past few years. Dahl said these storms are becoming stronger and more frequent because the solar cycle reached a period called solar maximum last year. \"Activity like this tends to happen more than it does at any other point in the 11-year cycle of the sun,\" he said. Thursday's space weather event follows a [historic occurrence in May](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2024/05/20/northern-lights-in-arizona-2024/73767877007/), when a geomagnetic storm, featuring the [strongest solar flare in seven years](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/15/sun-solar-flare-nasa-geometric-storm/73697831007/), reached the top category 5. That storm also treated Arizonans to a natural spectacle similar to Thursday's. When will northern lights be visible again in Arizona? The storm was likely to persist through this evening, but lights were unlikely to be seen again from Arizona because solar winds were slowing down, ostensibly weakening the storm into a category 2 by Friday evening, Dahl said. Still, if solar activity picks up, people can have a chance to catch the lights once again. \"The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right,\" according to NOAA statement. Dahl said Arizonans will also have several opportunities to enjoy similar space weather shows in the next few years as the solar cycle reaches its peak. Peak solar activity is expected either later this year or early next year, Dahl explained. However, \"it doesn't just shut off ... it's a slow comedown,\" he said. \"So the rest of this year, all of next year, and even until the year 2026, we’re still going to have a possibility of more storms like that.\" (This story was updated to add a photo.)",

    "title": "Website, app launched to digitise Urdu in Nastaleeq font",
    "text": "The development of website www.dastaan.io and its corresponding mobile phone Android app, which can convert images of printed Urdu text in the Nastaleeq script into an editable text for computers and also read them out, was termed on Thursday a landmark event in the digitisation of the Urdu language in the modern era. The website and app have been developed by the Neurocomputation Lab at the NED University of Engineering and Technology in collaboration with the Anjuman Taraqqi-e-Urdu Pakistan. They were launched by NED University Vice Chancellor Dr Sarosh Hashmat Lodi at the varsity’s auditorium on Thursday. Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Aneeq Ahmed, Anjuman President Wajid Jawad and Treasurer Syed Abid Rizvi were also present on the occasion. Explaining how the project was conceived, Jawad said he was once talking to then Jang Group President the late Imran Aslam, who told him that the media group was thinking about publishing the London edition of Daily Jang in the Roman script and had hired a consultant for the job. The Anjuman president said he thought that if Urdu could be converted into the Roman script through digital means, digital means could also be used to convert something into the Nastaleeq script. As he discussed this idea with Aslam, the latter facilitated his correspondence with the consultant, with whose help the Anjuman contacted Lahore University of Management Sciences to provide expertise for the task. Jawad said that when the VC of the NED varsity, which is situated at a stone’s throw from the Anjuman headquarters Urdu Bagh, came to know that the Anjuman was trying to hire LUMS experts to develop some digital platform for Urdu, he complained and said the NED University was a better option for the Anjuman due its close proximity. In this way, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the NED and Anjuman on January 28, 2022. Later, Dr Lodi quipped that neither he nor Jawad had any clear picture of what they were venturing into, but the team of the Neurocomputation Lab under its principal investigator Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi and project head Majida Kazmi actualised their vision. They developed an artificial intelligence-based programme, fed it with a large corpus of Urdu text provided by the Anjuman and enabled it to collect more corpora in Urdu from digital means. The event was told that currently, the website and app could convert any uploaded image of printed Urdu text into editable text form and read it. However, the project was still not finished as they were planning to add more features to it, including converting Urdu text into Braille for people with vision impairment and development of an IOS app. The project head, Dr Majida, said Urdu is one of the most difficult languages to be digitised because of its script in which alphabets keep on changing their form based on their position in the word. She explained that the development of any optical character recognition (OCR) system — an artificial intelligence system that can recognise a written language through its characters — for English or other European languages that are written in the Roman alphabets was way easier because their alphabets were written discretely, and not joined into the following alphabets. She said the Nastaleeq script was also not linear and words came on the line in a diagonal manner. Similarly, she said, some alphabets of Urdu were written above the line while others would go below the line, due to which it is difficult to programme an OCR system for Urdu. The project head said a total of around 300 individuals, including 200 interns, participated in the project and approximately 90,000 man hours were spent on it in around two years. She explained that three master’s thesis and 20 final-year projects were done on the project while a candidate was also pursuing PhD in it. She said any language that was not being digitised was an endangered language in this digital world and therefore the project was very significant for the survival of Urdu. Earlier, the religious affairs minister lamented that although we as a nation often declared our love for Urdu, such professed love did not transform into action. He asked why the examinations for CSS had not been taken into Urdu. He, however, said Urdu was still the national language of Pakistan understood everywhere in the country.
