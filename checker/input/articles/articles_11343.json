Several sugarhouses are choosing to push back their open house dates to accommodate for visitors near and far. Several sugarhouses are choosing to push back their open house dates to accommodate for visitors near and far. While Saturday's snowstorm is going to be a big boost for ski resorts in our region, it comes at a cost for another industry. Both New York and Vermont are having their maple open house weekend, but the storm has thrown a wrench in the plans for many participating sugarhouses. Browns River Maple in Essex Junction is just one of several sugar makers that have made the call to close on Saturday, on a day they’re used to seeing the most foot traffic of the season. \"I think about the last five or six seasons, where we had this open house on a weekend, Saturday is always the biggest day. Literally hundreds of people coming through Sunday, much less,\" said John Bourbon, a foreman at Browns River Maple. More than one hundred producers are signed up to participate this year, but now, all are challenged by what could bring the highest snow totals of the year. It’s a blow to sales, but an even bigger blow to sugar makers getting to connect with the community. \"We give people a tour, an explanation of all that, how the sugarhouse works, how the rig works, accumulation of sap, etc. And we all can look forward to that. You know, we like sharing that,\" Bourbon said. Another major concern for open house weekend is making sure word gets out quickly. \"The change in weather on Saturday is pushing a lot of those people to Sunday, and also just missing some of the in-person time. So that's, that's disappointing,\" said the executive director for Vermont Sugar Makers' Association, Allison Hope. But as they’ve had to do all throughout this sugaring season, participating producers are doing everything they can to adapt to the weather, which, in recent sugaring seasons, started with the first tap. Hope said, \"I know that people are tapping and boiling earlier than they ever have.\" \"First, we had an early start and it caught us by surprise, and our normal tapping time started probably two weeks later than it should have, and then we had back-to-back windstorms about four or five days apart,\" Bourbon said. After overcoming obstacle after obstacle so far this season, sugar makers, like Browns River Maple, are more than ready for visitors. \"By all means, come on up. We’ll teach you a little something about sugaring, give you the 10 cent tour,\" Bourbon said. Vermont Sugar Makers' Association encourages people to check their website to stay up to date on which sugar houses will be open on Saturday or on the last Saturday of March. They have a map that will show you the closest participating sugar houses near you.",

    "title": "Joe Chapman's West Brom player ratings as Leeds United are sent packing",
    "text": "West Bromwich Albion moved to within three points of play-off rivals Leeds United with another excellent Hawthorns victory and performance on Friday night. Grady Diangana's goal in the first half was enough to separate the two sides and give Albion breathing space to the chasing back beneath them. [Albion ](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc)were slow out of the traps, against a side who - on paper, at least - look like they've been created on a Fantasy Championship app. Cedric Kipre and Darnell Furlong both had to perform crucial bits of defending at different moments, as did Semi Ajayi when he recovered to deny Georginio Rutter in the penalty area. Leeds thought they were ahead when Sam Byram plundered at the back post, but he was rightly flagged for offside. That rather woke Albion up, and slowly the pendulum of momentum began to swing towards them. Jayson Molumby might've opened the scoring when he connected with Jed Wallace's centre, only to be denied with a block. Karl Darlow, standing in for Leeds' number one Ilan Meslier, who is suspended, failed to claim a corner and Kipre's eventual prod towards goal was cleared off the line by Djed Spence, before Okay Yokuslu somehow spooned the rebound over the bar, but Albion made the all important breakthrough when the Turkish midfielder delivered an incisive pass for Wallace and he teed up Diangana who did the rest at the second attempt. Albion began the second half the better, picking up where they'd left off, but they couldn't force an early second goal which would've really pushed Leeds against the buffers. On the hour mark, Daniel Farke threw on Patrick Bamford, Dan James and Jaidon Anthony in an attempt to force the issue. That sparked a period of pressure. Naturally, when you're chasing the game and your manager throws caution to the wind with his system and selection of personnel, Leeds were going to come on strong with their embarrassment of attacking riches. By comparison, Albion began to feel the effects. Wallace, brilliant again here, ran himself into the ground until he could give no more and was forced off. Slowly, Albion became more more conservative and with their changes, too; Diangana, Thomas-Asante and Molumby came off, while the likes of Nathaniel Chalobah and Kyle Bartley were introduced. There were hairy moments, as Kipre headed over his bar with Bamford awaiting to stoop home a cross just behind him. The final few moments were what you might've expected; bodies on the line, but a sheer will to win to a man, to not concede and dent another promotion rival's hopes in the process. West Brom player ratings Palmer 8 Had to beat away a bending Summerville shot, Leeds' only on target in the first half. Did come for a corner in the second half and missed. Other than that, though, Palmer was decisive when coming for the ball and communicative with his defenders. Furlong 8 Had some work to do in the opening stages and in one situation dealt expertly with the threat of Summerville on the edge of the box. Won a couple of huge headers at the death to help get Albion over the line. Ajayi 9 A big night for Ajayi, who was brought into the side in place of Bartley to help combat the pace and trickery of Leeds' attack. An aerial presence in both boxes and some immense skill which pleased the East Stand when he went on an adventure. An outstanding presence. Kipre 9 Made one significant block in the early moments when Leeds progressed into the Albion box. Might've opened the scoring but his effort was cleared off the line. Colossal at the back in the closing stages, winning everything. Townsend 8 It's not been an easy few weeks for the left-back, who struggled particularly at Middlesbrough, but this was Townsend back at the levels we expect from him. An outlet on the left throughout and had the unenviable task of half an hour of Dan James, but he blunted that blade. Yokuslu 9* Magnificent through ball sliced Leeds open at the back and, from it, came the opening goal. Should've scored himself, when he prodded over an open goal from yards out. Constantly pushing himself and others, disclosing his frustrations when things don't come off, something which is visible. A mammoth showing, Yokuslu at his best. Mowatt 7 The sort of night Mowatt would relish, against his former club. Not his usual game, in the sense that he didn't see as much of the ball, or was allowed to be as influential in running the game, as he was on Boxing Day. Lot of hard work and plenty of effort. Molumby 7 Brought into the side to help manage Swift but also to inject more energy and pressing intensity higher up the pitch, and he went about his business in his custom style, too. When an attempt to return a corner started a Leeds break, Molumby recovered appropriately. Diangana 8 Drifted inside a couple of times to switch the play. Right place at the right time to bag the opening goal. Some momentary brilliance as he gave a couple of pink shirts the slip down the left hand side to the delight of the fans, but ran into some cul-de-sacs too. A nice parting gift before he leaves for AFCON. Wallace 8 A menace for Sam Byram down the right hand side and he helped to create the opening goal for Diangana. Always the outlet with his pace and willingness to make runs and was often found by Yokuslu. Ran himself into the ground, which ultimately forced him off. Thomas-Asante 8 No goal here, but Thomas-Asante was excellent. Pretty punishing and unrewarding task as the first line of defence in the second half here, against a side who dominated the ball and were in search of a goal, but Albion's forward ran himself into the ground, dropped short, linked play and relieved pressure. Substitutes Swift (for Diangana 69) 7 An important cameo. Teed up Reach with brilliant vision and execution of a pass over the top. Glided around when in possession but important shift defensively. Bartley (for Molumby 69) 7 Like Swift, Bartley's match fitness and nous at the back, as well as his aerial prowess, was a werlcome introduction and he slotted in seamlessly. Reach (for Wallace 70) 7 First game back since April, sent on to do a defensive job. Might've secured it with an ambitious lob which Darlow held. Chalobah (for Mowatt 76) Sarmiento (for Thomas-Asante 86) Substitutes not used: Griffiths, Pieters, Pipa, Fellows Leeds United: Darlow, Spence (Anthony 60), Rodon, Cooper, Byram (James 60); Ampadu (Joseph 90), Gruev; Gnonto (Bamford 60), Piroe, Summerville (Firpo 90); Rutter Substitutes not used: Klaesson, Cresswell, Kamara, Gray GOALS Albion - Diangana 37; Leeds - The ref: Graham Scott Up next: Swansea City (A) - Monday, 1 January, 3pm kick off",

    "title": "Device Fingerprinting: A Powerful Defense for Detecting Fraud",
    "text": "Learn how advanced device fingerprinting techniques can protect your business from fraud\nIn today’s hyper-connected environment, fraudsters can use a single device to orchestrate sophisticated attacks under the radar. As bad actors become increasingly skilled at masking their browser configuration and user agents or resort to device spoofing, traditional security measures—like relying on IP addresses alone—struggle to keep up. That’s why device fingerprinting and browser fingerprinting are powerful tools against malicious activities. These methods generate device fingerprints that help distinguish legitimate users from those engaging in fraudulent activity.\nEvery individual device, whether a desktop, laptop, or among the billions of mobile devices in circulation, can provide insight into device attributes (such as OS version, screen resolution, and plugins) that form a unique digital fingerprint. By analyzing these data points, businesses can spot anomalies linked to fraudulent activity, which helps safeguard user trust and reduce potential losses.\nThis post examines how device fingerprinting identifies browser spoofing and why it plays a crucial role in preventing fraud.\nWhat Is Device Fingerprinting?\nDevice fingerprinting is a method that gathers various device characteristics—including browser type, browser versions, OS, installed plugins, time zone, and more—to generate a machine fingerprint or digital fingerprint. This fingerprint generally remains consistent across sessions, even if a user changes IP addresses or clears cookies.\n• Data Collection: Each connected device visiting your website or app—be it a real browser or one running on virtual machines—transmits specific information such as browser type, installed plugins, and browser versions.\n• Fingerprint Generation: These attributes form a browser fingerprint. You can instantly identify suspicious patterns by comparing a new fingerprint to a stored database of device fingerprints.\n• Comparison & Scoring: If a fingerprint is tied to malicious activities or a history of fraudulent activity, you can trigger extra steps like multi-factor authentication.\nWhy It Is a Must-Have Component of Your Fraud Defense\n1. Goes Beyond IP Addresses\nFraudsters can quickly mask or rotate IP addresses by using proxies or VPNs. Device fingerprinting digs deeper into browser configuration and device attributes, making it more difficult for attackers to hide.\n2. Persistent Identification\nCookies can be removed or blocked, but a machine fingerprint remains stable across sessions—even if certain settings change.\n3. Scalable & Real-Time\nWhether you’re dealing with one single device or millions of connected devices, it’s possible to flag suspicious behavior instantly and prevent further harm to legitimate users.\nKey Benefits for Modern Businesses\n1. Enhanced Fraud Detection & Bot Detection\nBy employing device fingerprinting, organizations can track repeated malicious activities tied to specific browser fingerprints—including those from device spoofing or virtual machines. This is especially helpful for e-commerce and banking platforms that face online fraud risks.\n2. Streamlined User Experience\nFewer verification steps are needed when a user’s digital fingerprint consistently appears legitimate. Conversely, unusual browser versions or configurations can trigger extra checks only for high-risk traffic, reducing friction for legitimate users.\n3. Cost Savings & Operational Effectiveness\nEvery chargeback or account takeover drains resources. Browser fingerprinting serves as a powerful tool to stop these attacks early so your security teams can address other priorities.\n4. Immediate, Actionable Insights\nKnowing a device’s risk level at the moment it connects is key to stopping fraudulent activity. With this data, your systems can automatically block, challenge, or monitor questionable users.\nBest Practices for Adoption\n• Comprehensive Data Collection\nCollect extensive device attributes—from browser type to installed plugins, OS details, screen size, and browser versions.\n• Privacy & Compliance\nMaintain transparent data handling practices and follow relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n• Integration & Automation\nWeave browser fingerprinting into existing workflows. Automation is key—particularly for mobile devices—to prevent manual workload overload.\n• Ongoing Monitoring & Refinement\nThreat actors keep adjusting their methods, including device spoofing. Update your security settings and thresholds to stay current.\nReal-World Use Cases\n1. E-commerce Payment Fraud\n• Challenge: Fraudsters use stolen payment details with unfamiliar browser versions or browser configurations to evade detection.\n• Solution: Device fingerprinting matches known fraudulent activity, blocking transactions before completion while preserving the shopping experience for legitimate users.\n2. Fintech Account Takeover\n• Challenge: Attackers log in from headless browsers or virtual machines.\n• Solution: A strong machine fingerprint flags suspicious setups, prompting extra authentication to hinder bad actors.\n3. SaaS Multi-Accounting\n• Challenge: A user repeatedly signs up from a single device to exploit free trials.\n• Solution: Browser fingerprinting identifies repeated device attributes, stopping further abuse.\nIntroducing the IPQS Device Fingerprinting API\nA direct way to adopt device fingerprinting is through the IPQS Device Fingerprinting API. It can handle connected devices at scale, providing accurate bot detection and fraud checks:\n• Easy Integration\nIPQS offers clear, organized endpoints for custom solutions or standard systems.\n• Advanced Analysis\nIPQS goes beyond basic device characteristics, examining over 300 device characteristics including browser configuration and browser versions to identify malicious activities.\n• Adaptive Learning\nAs attackers change tactics—like device spoofing—IPQS refines its risk scoring.\n• Wide Coverage\nWhether you see traffic from mobile devices or desktops worldwide, IPQS assesses requests in real time.\n• Global Honeypot Network\nOur network of honeypots attract and analyze malicious activity at scale, fingerprinting malicious devices to protect customers.\n• Dark Web Monitoring\nWe understand the tools fraudsters use to circumvent more basic device fingerprinting.\nConclusion\nDevice fingerprinting is a powerful tool that holds a crucial role in modern cybersecurity. By highlighting device attributes such as browser versions and generating a machine fingerprint (or multiple device fingerprints), businesses can guard against fraudulent activity while maintaining a positive experience for legitimate users.\nIf you’re prepared to strengthen your security, the IPQS Device Fingerprinting API can detect malicious activities, provide bot detection, and deliver quick, accurate insights—helping you stay ahead of bad actors.\nReady to Learn More? Schedule a demo with IPQS today and discover how our solutions can transform your approach to fraud prevention.\nAdding browser fingerprinting to your security processes helps protect customers and revenue, even in a changing threat environment.",

    "title": "Urinary Paranitrophenol Linked to Cancer Risk",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking study published in the prestigious journal BMC Cancer, researchers have unveiled surprising and potentially paradigm-shifting findings regarding the role of urinary paranitrophenol in cancer mortality. Paranitrophenol, a metabolic by-product commonly linked to exposure to organophosphate insecticides, has traditionally been associated with detrimental health consequences. However, new evidence drawn from an extensive analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) suggests a paradoxical relationship: elevated levels of this compound in urine are correlated with a reduced risk of death from cancer.\nFor decades, organophosphate insecticides and their metabolites like paranitrophenol have been subjects of intense scrutiny due to their prevalent use in agriculture and domestic pest control, alongside their suspected toxicity. Prior epidemiological studies flagged exposure to these chemicals as a public health concern, implicating them in neurological and developmental disorders. Yet, data evaluating their influence on longer-term outcomes such as cancer mortality has been scarce and at times contradictory. The present study represents one of the most comprehensive attempts to unravel this complex association using robust biochemical and statistical methodologies.\nUtilizing data from 3,362 adult participants, including 1,680 males, enrolled in NHANES, researchers measured urinary paranitrophenol levels through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This advanced analytical technique ensured precise quantification of the metabolite, minimizing potential confounding from cross-reactivity or measurement error. Participants were followed over an accumulated 22,750 person-years during which mortality outcomes were ascertained via linkage to the National Death Index, meticulously identifying deaths attributable to all causes and specifically to cancer.\nA pivotal component of the analysis involved the application of Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the risk of mortality across quartiles of urinary paranitrophenol concentration. The cohort was stratified accordingly, allowing for the investigation of dose-response relationships with both univariate and multivariate adjustments. Adjustments meticulously accounted for demographic variables, lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and prevalent comorbidities, ensuring that the observed associations were not spurious or confounded.\nThe results challenged conventional wisdom. While no statistically significant association emerged between urinary paranitrophenol levels and overall mortality, a striking inverse correlation was found with cancer mortality. Participants in the highest quartile of urinary paranitrophenol exhibited a hazard ratio of approximately 0.40 for cancer death relative to those in the lowest quartile, indicating a 60% reduction in risk. This association persisted robustly across unadjusted, partly-adjusted, and fully-adjusted models, underscoring its independence from common confounders.\nThis counterintuitive finding raises compelling questions about the biological mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenon. One hypothesis posits that paranitrophenol, or related metabolic by-products, might elicit anti-carcinogenic effects at certain exposure levels, potentially through modulation of cellular detoxification pathways or immune responses. Alternatively, the metabolite’s presence could be a biomarker indicative of other protective environmental or lifestyle factors not fully captured in the data. Further mechanistic and translational research is urgently needed to elucidate these pathways and validate these associations.\nCritically, the study’s strengths lie in its large-scale, nationally representative sample and the objective biochemical measurement of exposure. The use of NHANES data, which integrates comprehensive health and nutrition assessments with reliable mortality follow-up, lends considerable credibility to the findings. Moreover, the ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS technique represents a state-of-the-art approach to exposure assessment, far surpassing prior studies reliant on less sensitive measures.\nNevertheless, limitations must be acknowledged. The observational nature of the study precludes definitive causal inference. Residual confounding from unmeasured variables remains possible, as does reverse causation wherein declining health influences metabolite levels. The reliance on a single baseline measurement of urinary paranitrophenol may not fully reflect longitudinal exposure patterns. Finally, generalizability to populations outside the US or with differing exposure profiles warrants careful consideration.\nFrom an epidemiological perspective, these findings underscore the complexity of environmental chemical exposures and their multifaceted relationships with disease endpoints. They highlight the necessity of moving beyond simplistic toxicological assumptions towards a nuanced understanding of dose, timing, and context in risk assessment. Regulatory agencies and public health professionals should take note, but also await corroboration from independent cohorts and experimental models.\nThe implications for cancer prevention and mortality are profound. Should further studies confirm that higher urinary paranitrophenol levels are protective or indicative of protective processes, this could spur the development of novel biomarkers for cancer prognosis or even inspire new chemopreventive strategies. Conversely, it challenges existing narrative that all organophosphate exposures unequivocally increase cancer risk, prompting reexamination of risk communication and mitigation policies.\nThis work opens avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration, blending analytical chemistry, molecular biology, environmental epidemiology, and oncology. Robust laboratory investigations are needed to interrogate potential anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of paranitrophenol or its metabolic derivatives. Concurrently, longitudinal population-based studies incorporating repeated exposure measurements can clarify temporal dynamics and causality.\nThe authors conclude by emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation given the novelty and unexpected direction of their findings. Nonetheless, their research contributes a pivotal piece to the puzzle of environmental determinants of cancer mortality, challenging prevailing dogma and inspiring a reevaluation of organophosphate metabolites in public health discourse.\nAs research into xenobiotic metabolism and carcinogenesis evolves, this study underscores the power of large-scale biobanked population studies combined with precision analytical methods to uncover hidden protective factors amidst complex exposure matrices. It serves as a potent reminder that environmental chemistry can harbor surprises with profound implications for human health.\nIn summary, the observed inverse association between urinary paranitrophenol levels and cancer mortality presents an intriguing paradox that defies established toxicological expectations. This evidence invites a deeper inquiry into the physiological and molecular interplay between environmental metabolites and cancer biology, potentially illuminating novel pathways for prevention and intervention in oncology.",
