    "title": "PM Modi helped prevent ‘potential nuclear attack’ in Ukraine: Report | Latest News India - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi played a pivotal role in preventing a potential Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine, a CNN report has claimed.According to the report, citing two senior officials, the United States had been preparing rigorously for a potential nuclear strike by Russia on Ukraine.The report claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's outreach to Vladimir Putin, along with the intervention of other countries, played an important role in averting a nuclear disaster.The officials told the US-based network that the Joe Biden administration was concerned that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons to provide a deadly blow to Ukraine's war efforts.Amid the threat, the US urged India to intervene to discourage Russia from any misadventures.US officials say that outreach and public statements from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a crisis, CNN reported.Also read: PM Modi speaks to Putin, Ukraine war, Russia's BRICS presidency feature in talks\\\"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, and encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\\\" the senior administration official told CNN.\\\"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be. I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\\\" the officer said.India hasn't directly criticised Russia. However, PM Modi told Putin that this is not the era of war.CNN reported that Russian units were in danger of being surrounded, precipitating the danger of nuclear attack.It said Russia was also circulating a false flag story about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which could have been used as a ruse for a nuclear strike.\\\"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\\\" a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of the types of steps that we would've expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons,” he added.With inputs from ANI",

    "title": "The negative impact of social media on election outcomes - The Queen's Journal",
    "text": "[Natalie Viebrock](/author/natalie_viebrock) Social media is now shaping election outcomes as the first generation raised with it reaches voting age. Considering social media’s impact on election outcomes is only beginning to be studied, its increasing polarization has serious negative consequences for underrepresented minorities in the United States and around the world. It’s no secret social media’s greatly affecting the democratic process in countries worldwide. With vast amounts of information at our fingertips, and exposure to diverse views, social media has a strong liberating potential for democracy. However, this potential comes with significant risks. While social media can amplify marginalized voices and foster civic engagement, it also creates echo chambers, where algorithms prioritize content that reinforces existing beliefs. This not only deepens ideological divides but also fuels misinformation and polarizing rhetoric, challenging the very foundations of democratic discourse. Alongside the rise of social media, another trend has emerged since 2016: growing support for the United States President-elect Donald Trump. Since Trump’s 2016 election, his brand of populism has surged, reshaping political allegiances in ways few could’ve predicted. Fast forward to 2024, after losing in 2020, Trump has staged a comeback, winning against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. What’s most shocking about this outcome isn’t that Trump won, but the shifting demographics of his supporters. Despite Harris’s strong campaign for abortion rights and female representation, post-polling data indicates that female support for Trump has risen from [41 percent in 2016](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls) to [45 percent in 2024](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0). Republican votes from the Black population also rose from [eight](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls) to [13 per cent](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0) since 2016, [28](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls) to [46](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0) per cent among Latino voters, and [27](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls) to [39](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0) per cent for Asian voters. The 18 percentage point increase amongst Latino voters is especially surprising, considering comedian Tony Hinchcliffe compared Puerto Rico to a “floating [island of garbage”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/comedian-trump-rally-makes-racist-jokes-latinos-puerto-rico-rcna177514) at a Trump rally just days before the election. The Trump campaign has long been bolstered by anti-immigrant and xenophobic sentiment. During the 2024 presidential debate, Trump propagated the false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield Ohio were eating [domesticated cats and dogs](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-fringe-online-claim-immigrants-eating-pets-debate-trump-rcna170759). The growing presence of social media in political campaigns is undeniable. Trump has tweeted [50,022 times](https://www.thetrumparchive.com/insights/frequency) since the 2016 election. Both Trump and Harris heavily catered to online audiences during their campaigns by appearing with social media content creators such as Joe Rogan, and podcast host Alex Cooper. Politicians are increasingly careering to the younger generation, Trump allegedly [consulted his 18 year old son](https://www.thecut.com/article/barron-trump-donald-campaign-podcast-appearances.html) Barron Trump before appearing with popular live streamer Adin Ross. [READ MORE: Kamala Harris strategically targets Gen Z with a bold ‘Call Her Daddy’ appearance](https://www.queensjournal.ca/kamala-harris-strategically-targets-gen-z-with-a-bold-call-her-daddy-appearance/) Sixty-seven percent of respondents to the Reuters Institute Digital [News Report survey](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/democratic-creative-destruction-the-effect-of-a-changing-media-landscape-on-democracy/8C6548E16FA63289FC4C731AC512B075) between the ages of 18 and 24 say the Internet is their main source of news, including social media. The fear is that if social media breeds polarization, its growing presence in the political sphere will only further xenophobic attitudes in the US, ones that Trump harnessed throughout his campaign to secure victory in this year’s election. Concerns surrounding the of politics’ prevalence in this interactive public sphere centre on the formation of an “us vs. them” ideology towards immigrants and racial minorities. These ideologies perpetuate hate speech, harassment, and a terrifying uptake in violent hate crimes towards historically underrepresented groups. The use of anti-immigrant, racist, and xenophobic rhetoric is not isolated to political campaigns, it extends across the population, encouraging attitudes and mobilizing extremists. In 2015 and 2016, violent hate crimes increased by around [13 per cent](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0) , while the national crime rate fell by two percent. Between the second and third quarter of 2016, the US experienced a noticeable [spike in hate crimes](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0) toward underrepresented groups, raising concern. This directly coincides with Trump’s campaign and presidency. These statistics on hate crimes don’t even consider verbal harassment and indirect discrimination experienced by underrepresented groups in the US, and around the world. The overall fear with social media in politics is that it increases extremists’ abilities to connect and base their ideologies on the exclusionary rhetoric of populist leaders.

    "text": "5 Underrated Places to Visit in Bali Translator Editor 5 January 2024 18:35 WIB TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTCC) lists Bali as one of the tourist destinations that experienced overtourism from January to November 2023, along with Amsterdam, Athens, Paris, Phuket, and Barcelona. Despite the issue, Bali still boasts a lot of appealing but less explored places. Here is the list of five lesser-known areas of Bali that are worth visiting to avoid the crowds on the heavenly island: 1. Jatiluwih Jatiluwih Village, located in Tabanan Regency, is home to vast terraced rice fields with a unique irrigation system known locally as Subak. The Jatiluwih Rice Terrace is recognized by UNESCO as the world's cultural heritage. Tourists can enjoy stunning views of Mount Batukaru and the expansive rice fields, all in a relatively tranquil atmosphere. 2. Golden Marigold Fields The Marigold fields are located in a high mountainous area of Belok Village, Petang District, Badung Regency. Tourists must traverse hilly roads amid misty mountains to arrive at Gemitir Flower Garden. The beds of orange marigold flowers will undoubtedly spoil visitors. Hindu communities in Bali frequently use the flower in their ceremonies and rituals. 3. Asah Hill Bukit Asah or Asah Hill is a beautiful plateau scenery located in Bugbug Village, Karangasem Regency, flanked by the steep Panggian Hill and White Bias beach known as Virgin Beach Bali. The hill provides a perfect serene escape from the crowds. 4. Bias Tugel Beach Bias Tugel Beach or White Sand Beach situated in Padangbai Village, Karangasem area features a rocky shoreline that encircles the headlands at both ends. The beach is called the whitest sand in Bali with clear seawater and a quiet ambiance. It also has a small lagoon where tourists can swim or soak in it. 5. Nyang-Nyang Beach Nyang-Nyang Beach is located in Pecatu Village, South Kuta of Badung, close to Uluwatu. The beach offers clean white sand and ocean waves that are perfect for professional surfers. Its slightly secluded location provides complete privacy and tranquility for tourists. These hidden gems in Bali offer a unique and tranquil experience for tourists seeking an escape from the crowds while still enjoying the island's natural beauty and cultural richness.

    "text": "What in the name of Tim Horton’s is going on in Canada these days? In a truly amazing story, the head coach of the Canada women’s national team, Bev Priestman, was unceremoniously sacked due to her usage of drones to spy on Canada’s opponents (per [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40642277/olympics-2024-canada-women-soccer-coach-removed-drone-scandal)): Canada’s women’s national team head coach Bev Priestman has been removed from the country’s Olympic team over a scandal involving the use of drones to spy on opponents’ practice, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) announced Thursday. The COC said it made the decision after Canada Soccer decided to suspend Priestman for the remainder of the tournament. The episode began earlier this week when Canada’s opening opponent New Zealand complained to the International Olympic Committee’s integrity unit after it said drones were flown over closed practice sessions. But wait....there’s MORE — and it (loosely...okay VERY loosely) involves [Bayern Munich](https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com) star Alphonso Davies. The Canadian espionage is not just limited to the women, though. The men’s squad was — allegedly (we don’t need Marty McSorley hunting us down!) — also complicit: The announcement followed a report from TSN that both Canada’s women’s and men’s soccer teams have used drones to record opponent’s closed-door training sessions for several years, including during the women’s team’s gold-medal winning Tokyo Olympic tournament in 2021. As for Davies, we’ll just assume he didn’t need drone footage to do his business...okay? Anyway, what a mess, eh? Here’s to hoping that the coaching staff at least uttered the words of the immortal Doug McKenzie from Strange Brew after finishing up those now-infamous film sessions: “We hope you enjoyed the beer, oh, like I mean the movie, eh.” Looking for some thoughts on Bayern Munich’s rumored handling of the roster during this season — and why the club might be trying to force some players leave? What about the latest transfer news on Matthijs de Ligt, Xavi Simons, and Désiré Doué, plus a strong take on why it would be great to see Niklas Süle get his footballing life together? Awesome!

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) [#19](c19#c-19) \"En la Torá se afirma claramente que el hombre fue creado con un propósito concreto: emular la justicia Divina sobre la Tierra. En un principio, toda la humanidad fue elegida para esta tarea. Sin embargo, los primeros hombres no dieron cumplimiento a esta, misión y permitieron que la- corrupción y la violencia predominaran sobre la justicia y la bondad. Por ese motivo, Dios determinó que se produjera el Gran Diluvio (Mabul) a fin de eliminar a los malvados. En lo sucesivo el castigo por incumplimiento se llevaría a cabo a nivel nacional y no universal. Por esa razón Dios eligió a una nación en particular para que cumpliera esta misión. El Pueblo Elegido seria una nación modelo de Dios sobre la Tierra y demostraría al resto de la humanidad cómo comportarse. Esta nación era la judía.\"\nhttps://www.tora.org.ar/pueblo-elegido-y-su-mision/\nSi eso no es considerar a un pueblo por encima del resto, da lugar a suficientes malas interpretaciones como para llamarles supemacistas.\nNo hay religión buena, no hay fanático respetable.\n[#51](c51#c-51) Qué curioso que un diós omni-de-todo ande con fallos de producción (los prototipos) y culpe de ello a sus creaciones.\nDiós: te voy a hacer libre... y te voy a colocar aquí el fruto del pecado. No lo toques, eh?\nEl Diablo, también creado por Diós, pero SIN que Diós se percate, dice: no seais pipas, esto mola.\nDiós: Malos! Me habeis desobedecido. Hala.... a la mierda. Pero es vuestra culpa, eh? Que quede claro. Y si os poneis cabezotas, mando a Abogados Cristianos a que se querellen.\n[#58](c58#c-58) El dios abrahámico es un incompetente, no ha hecho más que demostrarlo. Ni omnipotente, ni omnisciente, ni omnipresente, ni bueno, ni hostias, como mucho un tipo que se aburre demasiado.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",

    "text": "Why Barenboim is tone-deaf on Gaza\nNews\nIn scenes reminiscent of Holocaust and ISIS atrocities, 1,500 Hamas invaders left more than a thousand Israeli civilians dead, almost all of them unarmed. The victims included babies, some of whom were slaughtered in unspeakable ways. Many young women were raped and murdered, their bodies defiled. At least 150 hostages were taken, including orphans, babies and an elderly holocaust survivor.\nThese are the verified facts of the past four days.\nDaniel Barenboim, in his\n response last night, called these actions ‘an outrageous crime’.\nHowever, he went on to condemn Israel’s subsequent siege of Gaza in even stronger terms: ‘a policy of collective punishment, which is a violation of human rights.’ In doing so he creates a false equivalence and a dangerously distorted view of a horrendous situation.\nWhat created this imbalance in Barenboim’s mind? He cites his formative relationship with an Egyptian-Palestinian academic: ‘Edward Said and I always believed that the only path to peace between Israel and Palestine is a path based on humanism, justice, equality and an end to the occupation.’\nThat is not entirely so. Said, when the best chance for peace presented itself at Oslo in 1991, militated against it and resigned from the Palestine National Council. Barenboim remains hostage to Said’s world-view. The Middle East tragedy has moved on, and Barenboim has failed to listen.",

    "text": "By Mark W. Sanchez ,\n3 hours ago\nBOSTON — In 2022, the Yankees began the season 61-23 and held a 15 ¹/₂-game lead in the AL East on July 8.\nWhat followed was a 38-40 struggle that climaxed with an Aaron Boone slam of the table , insisting that “it’s right in front of us,” en route to a meek sweep at the Astros’ hands in the ALCS.\nIn 2023, the Yankees were 36-25 on June 4, in the hunt for the division and in comfortable playoff position.\nAaron Judge reacts during the Yankees’ loss to the Mets on July 25, 2024. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post What followed was a 26-43 flatline that began with an Aaron Judge slam of his foot into the base of the wall at Dodger Stadium, a collapse that tanked the Yankees out of relevance .\nIn 2024, the Yankees were 50-22 on June 14, the only annoyance a relentless Orioles club that stayed within reach of first.\nWhat has followed has been a 10-22 run that has revealed far too many holes for a team with World Series hopes during a stretch that might have culminated with yet another Boone table-slam , albeit softer, and another “it’s right in front of us” after getting swept out of the Subway Series on Wednesday.\nIs it happening again?\nFirst-rounder Ben Hess bringing his ‘own style’ to Yankees’ organization\nA season that began with not just aspirations but expectations, after going all-in with the Juan Soto trade, again has been sidetracked by a midseason swoon that is threatening to ruin the year .\nBaltimore’s downturn has kept the O’s within an arm’s reach in the division, but the Yankees hold just a 3 ½-game lead on the final wild card.\nAaron Boone has repeatedly claimed that’s “it’s right in front of us” despite the Yankees’ struggles. Robert Sabo for NY Post They could be another poor series or two — beginning Friday at Fenway Park against a Red Sox club on the rise — from falling out of playoff position altogether.\n“We got the guys in this room that can flip the switch and get us back to where we need to be,” Judge said Wednesday, after a series in which he reached base five times (four walks and a hit by pitch) in nine plate appearances, the Mets seeing little reason to pitch to a superstar with no lineup protection.\nLuis Severino’s good-natured jab was not off-base.\nPerhaps with the exception of Gleyber Torres, who has begun to hit, the Yankees have had two dependable (and overwhelming) hitters and virtually no other threat in their batting order for nearly six weeks.\nSince this nosedive began June 15, hitters Nos. 1 and 4-9 — so, everyone outside of Soto’s and Judge’s 2 and 3 holes — have compiled a .207 average (that entered play Thursday worse than every team’s except the Mariners in the span) and .625 OPS (worse than everyone’s except the White Sox in the stretch).\nMets, Yankees have New York in baseball Bizarro World\n“We’re pissed off in there,” Boone said during a tense postgame news conference Wednesday. “We got a lot of pride in there. We got a lot of expectation in there.”\nGerrit Cole reacts during the Yankees’ loss to the Mets on July 24, 2024. JASON SZENES FOR THE NEW YORK POST No one has questioned the team’s desire or work ethic.\nJudge, notably, has begun questioning the team’s confidence.\nAlex Verdugo is in a 5-for-48 rut over his past 13 games .\nBen Rice has not come up with a multi-hit game since his three-homer day on July 6, 4-for-46 in the stretch.\nDJ LeMahieu, a two-time batting champion, has watched his average fall all the way to .179 .\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\nThere is reason for Yankees hitters to get discouraged, but doing so does not help.\n“You can read body language sometimes, and there’s some certain times where we’re hanging our head a little,” Judge said. “And you just need a little kick in the butt to get it going again.”\nThe Yankees’ downfall this season has been eerily similar to the past two years. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post Maybe Boone’s emotion, cursing on a couple of occasions and insisting that the club has the ability, was meant as a little kick.\nThe Yankees not long ago were the best team in baseball and did not yet even have their best pitcher.\n“I think we have a lot of talent in the room,” said Gerrit Cole, who owns a 5.40 ERA in seven starts since returning .\n“Just got to see what we did at the beginning of the season,” Soto added. “We have everything that we need to go out there and dominate.”\nTuesday’s trade deadline looms particularly large for a team that would not settle for anything less than a World Series and has holes in the infield, bullpen and perhaps outfield.\nPublicly at least, though, the team is insisting it has the means to fix the issues without Brian Cashman’s immediate help.\n“We hold the pen,” Boone said. “We’re in control of the story.”\nHe hopes it is a story Yankees fans haven’t already read the past two years.\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
