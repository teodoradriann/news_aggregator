    "title": "Rejection of new retirement age the right call",
    "text": "THE recent rejection by the National Council on Establishment of the proposed 65-year retirement age for workers is the right call. It is a welcome recognition of the imprudence of changing the status quo in a society with an explosively high population of unemployed youths and shrinking job opportunities. The NCE rightly noted that the proposed upward review of the retirement age negates the principles of renewal, youth empowerment and innovation. The PUNCH agrees. In its response to calls by the Nigeria Labour Congress for an upward review of the retirement age from 60 to 65, the organisation said, “Council rejected outright, the request for (the) upward review of retirement age for public servants to 40 years of service or 65 years of age; as it is contrary to national aspiration of renewal, youth empowerment, and innovation, and also not in tandem with the reality of our population dynamics.” The proponents of 65 years as the new retirement age or 40 years in service, whichever comes first, argue that the country is losing many experienced workers, who are still active and agile and can contribute meaningfully to the country’s development. In line with this, the Federal Government had at different times adjusted the retirement age for some categories of public servants, including judges and judicial officers, lecturers and non-academic staff in tertiary education institutions, and primary and secondary school teachers. President Bola Tinubu had also in June assented to a constitution amendment bill harmonising the retirement age of judges and judicial officers to 70 to bring to uniformity their retirement age and pension rights. Hitherto, the state, and federal high courts, National Industrial Court, Sharia and customary courts of appeal judges retire at 65, while Supreme Court justices retire at 70. The misplaced policy started with Tinubu’s immediate predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, who in 2022 signed a law increasing the retirement age for teachers to 65. No fewer than 15 states have started implementing the law, according to the Nigeria Union of Teachers. Extending the retirement age however is counterproductive, ill-considered and a reflection of the lack of strategic thinking by Nigeria’s governing elite. Nigeria has an unemployment rate of 33.3 per cent. It also has the world’s second highest number of jobless youths with 53 per cent in that segment after South Africa’s 61 per cent, according to the Spectator Index 2023. Millions remain jobless years after graduation. The World Bank reported that 19 million Nigerian youths entered the labour market in the five years to 2021 –about 300,000 each month –while only 3.5 million jobs were created within the period, thereby leaving about 80 per cent adrift. It said 30 million new jobs would have to be created by 2030 “just to keep the current employment rate constant.” With this reality, the federal and state governments ought to be adopting policies to reduce the retirement age and encouraging long-serving workers to retire early to reduce the large army of qualified but jobless youths. Rather than extending the retirement age or the length of service, the government should employ younger people. Tinubu and the state governors should provide incentives encouraging incumbent civil servants with 30 years and above in service to take early retirement without losing their benefits. They should introduce policies reducing the retirement age and maximum length of service. This should be accompanied by cost-cutting and massive private sector-led job-creating and investment policies. Privatisation and liberalisation of key economic sectors are crucial in this effort to achieve net gains economy-wide in jobs. The service elongation moves should be dropped.",

    "text": "India’s dream of winning a Test series in South Africa for the first time was ended inside three days as they crashed to an innings and 32 runs defeat at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday. With the series consisting of only two matches they can at best earn a share of the honours if they win the second Test starting in Cape Town on Wednesday. “We’ll regroup and come back,” said Indian captain Rohit Sharma after the game. “It’s important to regroup as quickly as we can, tough from a loss like these but as sportsmen you go through these times. Got to pick ourselves up.” India had no answer to South Africa’s pace attack as they crashed to 131 all out in their second innings, after conceding a 163-run first innings lead. A day which started with the match evenly poised turned into a rout for the tourists. Dean Elgar (185) and Marco Jansen (84 not out) transformed a slender 11-run lead for South Africa at the start of play into a strong position. They shared a 111-run sixth wicket partnership as South Africa took an overnight 256 for five to 408 all out despite the absent of injured captain Temba Bavuma. Virat Kohli hit an aggressive 76 for India before he was last man out but the rest of the batting collapsed against South Africa’s fast bowlers on a lively pitch. The second innings lasted just 34.1 overs. Kohli hit 12 fours and a six in an 82-ball innings. Shubman Gill made 26 but no other batsman scored more than six. “Having been sent in we got decent runs on the board,” said Sharma. “But we failed to exploit the conditions with the ball and our batting was poor in the second innings.” Kagiso Rabada set the tone for South Africa, bowling Sharma for a duck with a superb delivery which deviated off the pitch to hit the off stump. Rabada, who took five for 59 in the first innings, took two for 32 and finished the match with an outstanding diving catch at long-on to dismiss Kohli off Jansen, who took three for 36. Bavuma out Left-arm fast bowler Nandre Burger completed an impressive debut Test by taking four for 33, giving him match figures of seven for 83. Three catches went down in the slip cordon but none proved expensive. Elgar was named man of the match in his final Test on his home ground. He has announced he will retire from international cricket after the second Test. “It was pretty special for me,” he said. “It (the pitch) was pretty juicy. You’ve got to keep it nice and simple batting in Tests. Focus on the ball, play straight and play late.” It was a policy which India were unable to follow, although Sharma paid tribute to KL Rahul for his “brilliant” century in the first innings. South Africa captain Bavuma took no further part in the match after injuring his left hamstring on the first morning. Coach Shukri Conrad confirmed later that Bavuma would not play in the second Test. Former captain Elgar, who led the team on the field after Bavuma’s injury, will captain the team in Cape Town.",

    "text": "The rising temperatures are linked to a low-pressure system dominating Thailand’s atmosphere, combined with moist air currents from the Gulf of Thailand, which will increase humidity and intensify the heat. PATTAYA, Thailand – Experts have warned Thailand could experience extreme heat in April, with temperatures expected to reach 44 degrees Celsius (°C) in some regions. Forecasts from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Thai Meteorological Department indicate that April 2025 will be the hottest month of the year. Bangkok may see daytime temperatures averaging 35 °C, while northern provinces such as Mae Hong Son, Tak, Chiang Mai, Lampang, Uttaradit, Loei, and Sukhothai could endure maximum temperatures of 42–44 °C, especially in basin-like areas that trap heat.\nThe rising temperatures are linked to a low-pressure system dominating Thailand’s atmosphere, combined with moist air currents from the Gulf of Thailand, which will increase humidity and intensify the heat. Climate data suggests that 2025 could be Thailand’s third-hottest year in seven decades, following record-breaking temperatures in 2024 and 2023. In April 2024, Lampang recorded 44.6 °C, while several provinces exceeded 44 °C during the summer.\nLong-term climate trends indicate that extreme heat events will become more frequent due to global warming. Rising greenhouse gas emissions have already pushed global temperatures 1.5 °C higher than pre-industrial levels. Countries in tropical and equatorial regions, including Thailand, are expected to face summer temperatures exceeding 44 °C annually, with heatwaves growing more intense over time.\nHealth officials have warned of increased risks of heat-related illnesses, including heatstroke, which occurs when body temperatures rise above 40 °C. Symptoms can include severe fatigue, dizziness, muscle cramps, seizures, and, in extreme cases, organ failure.\nWith extreme heat becoming a recurring challenge, authorities stress the importance of public awareness and adaptive measures to protect public health. Precautionary steps such as wearing breathable clothing, drinking sufficient water, and limiting outdoor exposure will be crucial in mitigating the effects of rising temperatures. (NNT)",

    "text": "Most rural Oklahoma hospitals lack maternity care, others that do risk losing it Oklahoma is among 10 states in the U.S. where more than two-thirds of rural hospitals lack labor and delivery services, according to a [report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform](https://chqpr.org/downloads/Rural_Maternity_Care_Crisis.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosvitals&stream=top#_ga=2.6831476.739271016.1706044935-1775964563.1705281232). The state is home to 78 rural hospitals, and 68% operate without obstetrics services. Nationally, the average travel time to receive these services in urban areas is under 20 minutes, according to the report. In rural Oklahoma, it’s 39 minutes. This means more babies are being born outside the hospital, which [can impact maternal and infant outcomes](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105515#:~:text=The%20loss%20of%20hospital%2Dbased,poor%20maternal%20and%20infant%20outcomes.). Oklahoma’s maternal mortality rate is on the rise, according to a recent [report from the Oklahoma Maternal Health Task Force](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/11/20/maternity-health-oklahoma-among-highest-infant-mortality-maternal-death-rate/71608757007/). It went from 25.2 mothers per 100,000 live births during the 2018-2020 reporting period to 31 per 100,000 in the 2019-2021 period. A portion of the remaining rural hospitals with these services could also be in jeopardy of losing them. Hospitals require 24/7 access to physicians and nurses to provide high-quality maternity care, but it can be challenging to fund adequate staff when rural hospitals are experiencing losses in other patient services. Out of the remaining 25 hospitals with obstetrics services, 48% are losing money on other services. [Oklahoma has lost 10 rural hospitals](https://chqpr.org/downloads/Rural_Hospitals_at_Risk_of_Closing.pdf) since 2005, and it could be on its way to losing more. Of its 78 rural hospitals, 33 are at risk of closing, and 22 are at an immediate risk. Officials from the Center for Health Care Quality and Payment Reform say this can be based on numerous factors, including losses of patient services and low financial reserves. The answer to this issue is multi-faceted, and the report offers a few recommendations. The first is to address [existing staff shortages](https://www.kosu.org/health/2023-07-24/training-to-stay-oklahomas-homegrown-educational-approach-to-the-rural-physician-shortage) by recruiting and training medical students to deliver care in rural areas. Oklahoma State University, for example, provides a [rural medical track](https://medicine.okstate.edu/com/admissions/rural-medical-track.html), which allows students to prepare for a rural primary care residency. The report also recommends employers require health insurance and Medicaid plans to pay amounts that adequately cover maternity care services. The cost to insurance companies for having staff available 24/7 can be the same between rural and urban hospitals, and this method would ensure better access to services. “Every day that steps are not taken to implement the changes in workforce recruitment and payments described above increases the likelihood that more women and babies will die unnecessarily,” the report reads. - [KGOU](https://www.kgou.org/) is a community-supported news organization and relies on contributions from readers and listeners to fulfill its mission of public service to Oklahoma and beyond.

    "text": "После заявления канцлера Германии Фридриха Мерца о том, что Германия, Великобритания, Франция и США снимают все ограничения для Украины на удары по целям на территории России, внимание переключилось на реальную дальность западных вооружений.У одной из европейских стран, отменивших ограничения на использование предоставленных Украине дальнобойных ракет против российских целей, имеется крылатая ракета, радиус действия которой превышает не только у немецкой Taurus, но и у британско-французской Storm Shadow/SCALP.Прежде всего важно понимать, что эффективность крылатых ракет против российских объектов определяется не только их максимальной дальностью, но и доступом к очень детализированным цифровым картам, необходимым для навигации и наведения. Кроме того, такие ракеты не летят по прямой – они следуют сложным, заранее запрограммированным маршрутам, чтобы обойти вражескую систему ПВО.",
