    "title": "Emil Avdaliani：The Dawn of New Order in the Middle East - 20240202 - 觀點 - 每日明報 - 明報新聞網",
    "text": "【明報文章】The Middle East is in chaos. It is still a managed chaos, but the geopolitical tensions could spiral out of control. The region, which just over a year ago was considered as a geographic area no longer seen as pivotal, where geopolitical troubles seemed to subside and the US – traditional great power – looked elsewhere, now has come back to the forefront of global geopolitics.\nMuch of what is happening in the Middle East is exaggerated. Neither the entire region is pivotal economically nor are there powers able to openly challenge the greater powers. The region remains sandwiched between Russia, China, India and the US from a far, which makes the Middle East vulnerable and highly unstable.\nYet with the war in Gaza, unfolding crisis in the Red Sea, Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iranian military officers in Syria as well as Iran's active support for various Shia and Sunni actors across the Middle East makes the latter a focus of global geopolitical changes. To this should be added recent tensions between Iran and Pakistan which led to the bombing of each other's territory.\nThe Middle East is therefore back on agenda of major powers. To be more precise, Russia, China or even India have never stopped regarding the region as a critical area. The change was taking place in the US thinking which over the past several years seemed to shift its attention away to the war in Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific region for more intense competition with China.\nThe recent events in the Middle East indicated that Washington cannot afford the decrease in its influence in the region. In fact, the US now strongly believes in the need to strengthen its position. For the American leadership the alternative would signal a collapse of the existing balance of power in the Middle East and the rise of a completely new order beneficial to other actors.\nIt is still however unclear how the US will be able to maintain its posture. The fulcrum of its prestige lies in its stated ability to bring Israel and major Arab states to the table, and the power to keep sealines safe. Both of these missions are now endangered especially the Saudi-Israeli reconciliation because for Saudi Arabia any major rapprochement with the Jewish state amid the brutal war in Gaza will only cause negative reactions from across the Arab world.\nThis means that Saudi Arabia will prefer a strategy of wait and see and will likely try to extract from the US as many concessions as possible. Among them the most prominent are easy access to the US military industrial sector, potential transfer of some kind of nuclear technologies for civilian pusposes and thirdly an expanded version of military and security cooperation which could involve Washington's security guarantees. At least this is what the statements from the leadership of the two countries aluded to.\nSeen from a global perspective, disturbances in the Middle East are not separated events but are intervowen into the shifting world order. More chaotic, brutal and based less on multilateralism, the emerging system will be fraught with many challenges and outrights threats. Coupled with the climate change, insecurity in supply chains and potential new pandemics, these shifts are indeed all-encompassing and turn more threatening with each new instability.\nThe changing order in the Middle East however does benefit some actors and those are not so much bigger powers such as the US, China, Russia or the EU, but more the so-called middle powers. Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey use intensifing rivalry among greater powers and aptly choose not to side with any single power. In an increasingly multi-aligned world overdependence is now seen as dangerous to national interests.\nIn the Middle East it is not longer a competition between the US and global territorism, not the US against dicatotorship. The Middle East has now turned into a geopolitically overcrowded space and it is hard to draw parallels with any other period from the past centuries when such a multiplicity of actors was vying for influence in the area stretching from the Meditarranean to Pakistan and Central Asia.\nEmil Avdaliani is a professor of international relations at European University in Tbilisi, Georgia.\n[Emil Avdaliani]",

    "text": "FOXBORO, Mass. — The New York Jets’ victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday wasn’t your typical\nWeek 18 matchup between two teams at the bottom of the league standings.\nThere was something extra for both sides.\nIf you haven’t heard by now, Bill Belichick’s\nfuture is up in the air. It’s believed that Sunday marked his final game with the Patriots, with the entire region being made well aware through various reports. That wasn’t lost on the Jets, who were well aware of the uncertainty in New England, making their eventual victory something special.\n“It feels good,” Jets head coach Robert Saleh said postgame. “I’ve played him a lot throughout my career. He’s been around for a very long time. I’ll give him credit. If you ain’t got no haters, you ain’t poppin. He’s been poppin for a very, very long time, so when you get one over him it’s special.”\nStory continues below advertisement\nIf that isn’t enough to convince you New York felt the uncertainty added something, Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner all but confirmed as much.\nMore Patriots\n“I’d be lying if I said we haven’t talked about that in the locker room,” Gardner said. “It’s something to talk about down the line.”\n[Leave a comment.](javascript:void(0))\nThe Jets, who broke a 15-game losing streak against the Patriots with their win, had nothing but respectful things to say when asked about Belichick. In fact, Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley used the opportunity to talk about the 71-year-old as a way to\nreturn the favor.\n“I appreciate the opportunity to play against him,” Mosley said. “… I have so much respect for him. (I appreciate) all the times he was asked about me and all the things he said, I never take that for granted.”\nStory continues below advertisement\nThere hasn’t been a final decision made just yet, as Belichick and Patriots owner Robert Kraft are\nexpected to meet during the week. It’s following the conclusion of that meeting that we’ll get an answer regarding the former’s future.\nIn the meantime, the Jets can enjoy a victory in what they believe was Belichick’s finale game with the Patriots.\nFeatured image via Brian Fluharty/USA TODAY Sports Images",

    "text": "A woman who works in the sex trade was violently, sexually assaulted by a man who picked her up in his car on the Downtown Eastside earlier this week, according to authorities, who say the suspect is still at-large. Just after midnight on June 10, a man picked the woman up near the intersection of East Hastings Street and Campbell Avenue, the Vancouver Police Department said in a news release Thursday. \"The suspect assaulted the woman with a weapon, then pushed her out of the car near Oppenheimer Park. Two passersby came to the woman’s aid and called police,\" the statement says. \"The woman is now recovering from her physical injuries.\" The man's identity is not known but he is described as white, between 40 and 50 years old, and weighing 300 pounds. Police also say he has a \"receding hairline\" and was wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants at the time of the alleged assault. The VPD is appealing for information in the case, while also telling those engaged in sex work to \"be extra vigilant.\" Anyone who thinks they can assist the investigation is urged to call 604-717-0601.

    "title": "A rare flower is on display at the US Botanic Garden for visitors to see…and smell",
    "text": "WASHINGTON - Two rare stink flowers are on display at the United States Botanic Garden and may begin blooming this weekend. Native to the rainforests of Sumatra, the \"corpse flower\" is known for its size, often growing up to 12 feet tall in the wild, its ephemeral bloom cycle, and its unique scent. LONDON, ENGLAND - APRIL 22: Kew Garden's Titan Arum, also know as The Big Stink due to its repulsive odour is in rare full bloom at Kew Gardens on April 22, 2016 in London, England. The flower can weigh up to 70kg and is housed in the Prince of Wales \"If you’ve ever walked by a really stinky trashcan in the middle of a summer day, where it’s kind of heated up and just foul smelling, that’s a pretty good representation of what it smells like,\" said Devin Dotson, a spokesperson for the gardens. But the corpse flower serves a much bigger role in DC than just stinking up the city for a couple of days. The flowers reflect a conservation effort from botanic gardens nationwide to preserve plants in danger of extinction. The International Union for Conservation of Nature predicts that the corpse flower has declined by more than 50 percent over the last 150 years and that there are only about 1,000 left in the wild. US Botanic Garden does not anticipate moving the collection of over 30 mature corpse flower plants into the wild anytime soon, but scientists are working to develop genetic diversity in A. titanium collections and keep them healthy in case the wild population does go extinct. The garden has curated a nearly perfect environment for the flower to bloom often, a process that is rare in the wild. The bloom, and stench, lasts around four days. If you’re looking to catch the most potent scent, aim to get there soon after the flowers begin to open. Conservatory hours have been shifted to 11 am- 6 pm from July 8th to August 30th to allow visitors to see these stink flowers. \"They’re huge, and they’re beautiful, and they’re stinky, and they’re short-lived, and they have all these fascinating elements to them,\" said Dotson.",

    "text": "Unease in Tamil Nadu BJP as high command set to unveil new office-bearers' list\nSources indicated that KT Raghavan, a former state general secretary who was sidelined during Annamalai's tenure, is likely to be reinstated in a significant capacity\nCHENNAI: A sense of unease is simmering within the Tamil Nadu unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the party's high command moves closer to unveiling a fresh list of state office-bearers.\nAccording to well-placed sources, several leaders perceived to be close confidants of former state president K Annamalai are likely to be sidelined, signalling a recalibration of internal equations.\nThe impending reshuffle, expected to be announced in the coming days, is seen as more than a routine organisational rejig.\nParty insiders suggested that it marks an intentional course correction following the Lok Sabha elections, with the leadership keen to broaden its appeal and consolidate its cadre strength ahead of the crucial 2026 Assembly polls.\n\"This is not just another list—it reflects a deeper shift in strategy, \" a senior BJP functionary told DT Next, requesting anonymity.\n\"The high command appears to be moving away from the confrontational style that came to define the Tamil Nadu unit under Annamalai. Leaders who were closely associated with that approach may now find themselves pushed to the sidelines, \" the leader said.\nAmong those reportedly facing marginalisation are several of Annamalai's core strategists—key players in his high-octane 'En Mann, En Makkal' yatra and architects of his aggressive social media outreach.\nThese leaders, once considered his inner circle, have allegedly been excluded from recent strategic discussions, an apparent indication of their diminishing influence.\nSimultaneously, the reshuffle is expected to bring back into prominence leaders with longstanding ties to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and those who have maintained strong working relationships with the party's national leadership.\nSources indicated that KT Raghavan, a former state general secretary who was sidelined during Annamalai's tenure, is likely to be reinstated in a significant capacity.\n\"KT Raghavan's return symbolises the high command's attempt to reassert traditional organisational values, \" a senior leader said.\nAlongside him, former Congress MLA-turned-BJP leader S Vijayadharani is also likely to be given a prominent position.\nVinoj P Selvam, who was brought into the state secretary role by Annamalai, is expected to be elevated further, signalling the leadership's continued trust in his organisational skills.\nHowever, state vice-president Karu Nagarajan, another figure associated with Annamalai's leadership, may face a reduction in responsibilities.\nOnce the Chennai zonal in-charge and general secretary during L Murugan's presidency, Nagarajan is reportedly not in the reckoning for key roles this time.\n\"The high command feels there was a lack of coordination and poor grassroots engagement under his watch,\" a senior party source says.\n\"The Chennai zone is likely to come directly under state president Nainar Nagenthran, \" sources adds.\nOthers who may lose out in the new setup include Youth Wing president Ramesh Siva, Amar Prasad Reddy, and Jayaprakash — all perceived as loyalists of Annamalai.\nReacting to the speculation, Karu Nagarajan downplayed the reports.\n\"We do not work for individuals — we work for the party. Whether it is Tamilisai, L Murugan, Annamalai or Nainar Nagenthran, we follow the party's direction. Rumours are spread by those who are not true to the party. I will continue to serve the BJP in whatever capacity I'm assigned, \" he told this newspaper.\nWhen asked about this, a senior BJP leader closely involved in the restructuring process said, \"Reshuffles are not about individuals — they're about the organisation's long-term vision. The BJP is focused on building a disciplined, grassroots-driven force in Tamil Nadu. Roles may change, but commitment to the party must remain constant.\"",

    "text": "La influencer y exesposa de Marcelo “Chino” Ríos, Paula Pavic , se encuentra en pleno proceso de divorcio con el extenista. Por ello, se ha mantenido activa en redes sociales y ha acudido a diferentes programas de televisión relatando su experiencia. Fue de esta manera que participó en el programa “La Divina Comida” , espacio donde conoció al jugador de fútbol americano Sammis Reyes .\nFue en el programa de Chilevisión donde le confesó que era una gran admiradora. Sin embargo, en conversación con LUN , Pavic indicó que más allá “de la altura o la cosa física, a mí me encantó su forma de pensar”.\nAsimismo, la creadora digital confesó que han hablado “harto esos días. Me alucinaba darme cuenta de que hay gente joven tan conectada con otro nivel de conciencia. Hay gente tan despierta y uno empieza a vibrar en un nivel de frecuencia que atrae a personas que están en la misma que la tuya” .\nAl continuar con los halagos, Pavic detalló que le insinuó que “era perfecto” y, según el citado medio, lo que más la impresionó fue “su mentalidad, su físico y todo. Todavía estoy buscando cuál será su imperfección”.\n“Nunca lo dije en onda de que me gustara o para tener algo con él. El punto es ¿por qué no podría piropear a un hombre con esa cabeza (mentalidad)? ¿Qué tiene de malo que lo haga?” , indicó.\nPara finalizar los elogios contra el primer chileno en jugar fútbol americano en Estados Unidos, comentó que comenzó a seguirlo en Instagram y que nada de esto era un secret o, ya que en una actitud “sincera” se lo había comentado con Reyes.",
