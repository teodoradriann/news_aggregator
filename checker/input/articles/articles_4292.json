    "text": "India Online Visa is pleased to announce the extension of its online visa program to people of Luxembourg, Chile, Albania, Mexico, and Bolivia in an endeavor to enhance travel and cultural exchange. With this project, we hope to strengthen our international ties and highlight the enriching experiences that travelers from around the world can have in India. Citizens of these nations can now access the Indian online visa system, which simplifies the application process for a variety of visa categories. Those looking to see the varied landscapes, rich cultural legacy, and historical riches of India will have an easier time getting their visas. INDIAN VISA FOR LUXEMBOURG CITIZENS Since 2014, the availability of the Indian Visa in electronic mode has been extended to Luxembourg nationals. The India e-Visa, a government-issued document, facilitates entry and travel to India for residents and citizens of Luxembourg. Online applications are accepted from Luxembourg, simplifying the overall process. Currently, more than 169 countries are eligible to apply for an Indian e-Visa. Introduced in 2017, the visa aims to streamline the process, saving time and money for tourists. Foreigners visiting India for pleasure, tourism, or short-term medical treatment have the option to apply for an eVisa. A Tourist visa, valid for a single entrance, allows a 30-day stay. For those desiring an extended stay in India for leisure purposes, Long-Term Tourist eVisas for 1 year and 5 years are available. These visas permit multiple entries during their validity period, with each stay limited to 90 days. An e-business visa, offering multiple entries, allows a 365-day stay, with a maximum continuous stay of 180 days per visit. Medical e-visas and Physician Assistant e-visas enable three entries into India for medical treatment or accompanying family members, allowing a total stay of 60 days from the first arrival date. The application process for the online Indian e-Visa is quick, taking only a few minutes to complete. Indian Visa Requirements for citizens of Luxembourg - A valid Passport that is valid for 6 months - A valid Email address to receive the e-visa in their Inbox. - They can use a Credit/Debit Card or PayPal Account to pay for the e-visa fees. INDIAN VISA FOR CHILE CITIZENS In 2015, alterations to the visa procedure by the Indian government resulted in the extension of online travel authorization to 169 nations, including Chile. This modification allowed citizens of Chile to efficiently apply for electronic visas. Before entering India, individuals are required to present a valid passport and a visa as proof of identity. Since 2014, an online application form for Indian visas has been made accessible to Chileans. Chilean citizens now have a quicker and more convenient process for applying for a travel permit to India. There are three types of e-Visas available to Chileans: the e-Tourist Visa, the e-Business Visa, and the e-Medical Visa. The Tourist visa is suitable for those intending to visit India for tourism purposes, allowing a vacation, family reunion, sightseeing, or retreat for up to 90 days. The E-Business Visa caters to individuals with business-related visits, offering a stay of up to 180 days for attending meetings, initiating business ventures, hiring staff, or delivering lectures. The e-Medical Visa is designed for travelers seeking medical treatment in India, providing a maximum stay of 60 days and allowing a total of three visits. Before completing the visa application, applicants should verify the specific Indian visa requirements applicable to Chilean citizens. The convenience of online applications eliminates the need for Chilean citizens to schedule an appointment with the Indian Embassy for a Tourist Visa. The entire application process, including fee payment and document submission, can be efficiently completed online, ensuring a faster and more convenient experience. Indian Visa Requirements for Citizens of Chile - A valid passport and a complete scan of the information page. - A digital passport photo. - A valid email address to receive the eVisa in their Inbox. - They can use a credit/debit card or PayPal account to pay for their visa fees. INDIAN VISA FOR ALBANIA CITIZENS Albanians, in addition to undertaking pilgrimages, plan vacations to India, benefiting from the friendly relations maintained between Albania and India. The Indian authorities mandate obtaining a visa before visiting the country. However, obtaining an Indian visa has become more accessible for Albanians since 2014. The Indian government introduced an online application form for Indian visas specifically designed for Albanian citizens, streamlining the process. The online document, akin to a paper visa, grants entry into the country. Notably, unlike a traditional paper visa, this online process eliminates the need to visit the embassy in person. In 2015, the Indian government revamped its visa process, extending online travel authorization to 169 countries, including Albania, thereby facilitating e-visa applications for Albanian citizens. Albanian citizens now have the option to apply for three distinct types of India e-Visas: the e-Tourist Visa, the e-Business Visa, or the e-Medical Visa. The Tourist e-Visa, valid for 30 days with a double entry, cannot be extended or converted. For longer stays, Albanian citizens may opt for a 1-year or 5-year Tourist e-visa, allowing multiple entries with a maximum stay of 1 year or 5 years, provided each stay does not exceed 90 days. The E-Business Visa, valid for 365 days from the date of Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) issuance, permits a stay of 365 days, with multiple entry options available. The Electronic Medical Visa is issued to Albanian citizens requiring medical treatment in India, allowing three entries and a maximum stay of 60 days from the date of arrival. Previously requiring a visit to the Indian Embassy, the entire application process for these e-Visas can now be completed conveniently from home using a computer or smartphone, connected to a WiFi connection, enabling Albanians to apply for their Indian e-Visa online within minutes. Indian Visa Requirements for citizens of Albania - Citizens need a valid passport that is valid for 6 months - A recent photograph - A valid email address to receive the eVisa in their Inbox. - They can use PayPal or a debit/credit card so they can pay for the visa fees. INDIAN VISA FOR MEXICO CITIZENS India stands as one of South Asia's premier tourist destinations, and for those traveling from Mexico, the journey has become notably simpler. Mexico is among the 169 nations whose citizens qualify for the India e-Visa, making the process of obtaining a visa for Mexico straightforward. Prospective visitors can apply for a visa online and secure approval before departing from Mexico, offering a convenient approach. While Mexico isn't part of India's visa waiver nations, the application for an India e-Visa is accessible for Mexican citizens. Since 2014, the Indian government has made the Indian Visa application form available online specifically for Mexican citizens. Various types of India e-Visas cater to different activities such as tourism, business travel, family visits, and short-term medical treatment. For instance, the India Single Entry tourist Visa allows a stay of up to 90 days and covers activities like tourism, family visits, or stays at wellness retreats. Travelers have a one-year window after visa approval to enter India. The Double Entry eBusiness Visa is designed for those on business trips, permitting a total stay of up to 180 days. Similar to the tourist visa, business visa holders have one year to enter India upon visa approval, with the flexibility to engage in activities like attending business meetings, guided tours, or participating in business fairs or exhibitions. Mexican citizens can also opt for an eMedical Visa to India, allowing three entries for short-term medical treatment, with a maximum stay of 60 days. The online application process for the India e-Visa is user-friendly, eliminating the need to personally visit an Indian Embassy or Consulate. The entire application and approval process can be completed efficiently in as little as two business days, thanks to the streamlined online system.

To facilitate a quick and easy entry into the country, individuals from Bolivia will need an e-Visa for India, an accessible digital document online.

    "title": "New study permits approved expected to drop 50% from 2024",
    "text": "The number of new study permits approved in 2025 is expected to drop by 50 per cent from last year as a growing number of the permits are going to international students changing schools or programs, or extending their studies in Canada, according to new projections.\nFewer new international students — the result of a decline in new study permit applications and approval rates — could spell trouble for the postsecondary education sector, which will continue to see enrolment drop for at least the next three years, warns an analysis by ApplyBoard based on the latest government data.\n“Onshore students and students extending their studies may help Canada reach its cap targets in 2025, but this trend is unlikely to hold in future years,” said the forecast released Wednesday.\n“Search engine data has shown that interest in studying in Canada has fallen at a greater rate than for Australia, the U.K. or the U.S. And with issued study permit extensions now outpacing new study permits, the flow of new international students toward Canadian institutions is weakening.”\nCanada should be alarmed by the low new student count, said Meti Basiri, CEO and co-founder of the online marketplace for learning institutions and international students.\n“We have effectively closed the tap,” he told the Star. “When your graduation exceeds significantly your entry into the process ... two years from now you will have no students because you graduated everyone.”\nLast year,\nOttawa capped the number of new study permits issued in order to reduce international student admission by 35 per cent, as Canada’s temporary resident population was soaring. The cap did not apply to students for master’s and doctoral programs or in elementary and secondary schools.\nThis year,\nthe study permit caps were reduced by another 10 per cent and include those pursuing post-graduate studies in the country.\nLeveraging early 2025 study permit data, ApplyBoard projects the total number of study permits issued may reach 420,000, just short of the overall cap (437,000). However, Basiri said that’s deceiving because only 163,000 of these permits are going to new international students, half of the volume admitted in 2024 and nearly 70 per cent fewer than 2023.\n“The total number of students still seems high, but give it 18 months or 24 months from now, you all of a sudden have a significant shortage of the students,” he said. “Why? Because the top of the funnel wasn’t filling up.”\nLisa Brunner, a research fellow at the UBC Centre for Migration Studies, believes the softened demand has to do more with the\npost-graduation work permit changes than the cap. Many international students study abroad to ultimately obtain permanent residence but the changing policies have made it difficult to plan toward that goal.\nOn Wednesday, the Immigration Department added 119 and removed 178 fields of study in key sectors from\nthe work permit eligibility list for international graduates.\n“Many international students in Canada today feel betrayed by the lack of permanent residency options that were promised to them,” said Brunner, who studies migration and education.\n“If Canada does not make viable, predictable permanent residency pathways clear for international students, a portion of new students will turn to other so-called competitor countries.”\nApplyBoard’s projection takes into account two significant shifts that have occurred in the past 18 months: falling study permit approval rates and a significant increase in study permit extensions.\nStudy permit extensions will account for over 60 per cent or 260,000 of the 420,000 total study permits issued in 2025, it noted, up from 44 per cent in 2024 and 29 per cent in 2023.\nBetween January and April of this year, there was a 30 per cent drop in new study permit applications compared to the same months in 2024 and 70 per cent compared to 2023. The new study permit approval rates also declined to 33 per cent over the first four months of 2025, resulting in less than 31,000 new approvals.\nBasiri said Ottawa’s study permit caps were established in part on the 60 per cent approval rate in 2023, almost double the current rate. It means a bigger pool of applicants is required to meet the targets.\nWhile colleges faced the most direct impacts of the caps in 2024 and continue to experience substantially lower demand in 2025, universities are now seeing a broader weakening of student demand, said ApplyBoard.\nAccording to the 2025 data, it said study permit applications for university bachelor programs dropped 39 per cent year-over-year, with applications for university graduate programs declining by 32 per cent.\nMany educational institutions have already laid of staff and cancelled programs.\n“Fewer study permit applications are not necessarily bad,” said Brunner. “The question is how institutions, provinces and the federal government manage the economic consequences rippling across the higher education sector.”",

    "text": "If you believe everything you've seen in romantic comedies, you'll think that falling in love will lead to your perfect, fairytale life. If you believe everything you've seen on sitcoms, then you'll believe all marriages end with unhappy husbands and nagging wives. Well, neither portrayal of love is completely accurate. Here are a few things that nobody will tell you about falling in love: Snapshot Survey Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Please subscribe for your personalized newsletter: It Doesnâ€™t Happen Overnight You might develop feelings for someone overnight, but you won't be able to form a successful relationship overnight. That requires a lot of effort. In order to love your partner fully, you have to learn about their passions, hear about their interests, and see their flaws. If you do all of that, and can still say that you love them, then you know that your feelings are legitimate. Youâ€™re Going to Fight about Dumb Things Even after you fall in love with someone, you're still going to have arguments with them. It's impossible to date someone, live with someone, and see them every single day without getting annoyed by some things. Of course, frequent fighting doesn't mean that you should break up. If you two are meant to be, then you'll be able to compromise and move past your fights. Itâ€™s Terrifying Love is a little less terrifying after you meet the right person. However, the scariness doesn't disappear completely. After all, it's a big deal to open your heart up to someone. You risk letting them cheat on you, disrespect you, and break up with you. Love isn't all highs. There are some lows, too. You Can Give Each Other Bad Habits You've probably heard that the right person for you will make you a better person. While that's true, it's also possible for you to pick up some of their bad habits. If you always see them drinking, then you might start drinking more yourself. You Need More than Love to Make a Relationship Work Love is beautiful, but it's not all you need to make a relationship work. If your man wants to have children, but you don't, then you can't stay together. If you don't have the same goals for the future, then one of you will end up unhappy in the end, even though you love each other madly. You Can Love Someone and Dislike Them at the Same Time If you've ever witnessed a divorce, you've probably seen proof that a couple can love each other, even though they don't like each other anymore. Sometimes, the little things will get to you and your relationship will end. Of course, that doesn't mean the love has faded away. It just means it's no longer strong enough to maintain a healthy relationship. Most People Will Assume Your Relationship Will Fail When you're young and claim that you're in love, adults will make fun of you. When you're older, that doesn't actually change. Since the divorce rate is so high, most of your friends and family members will assume that your relationship is going to fail, even though they probably won't admit it aloud. However, you can't let their doubts get you down. You May Lose Other Relationships When you fall in love, you tend to make that person your number one. You'll do anything to see them and, if possible, you'll spend all of your time together. When that happens, you don't spend as much time talking to and seeing your best friends and family members. This could cause major tension for your existing friendships and relationships. You Have to Compromise More than Ever If you grew up with siblings, you'll know that it's all about sharing and give and take. But when you're in a relationship, you will have to do even more things that you don't particularly enjoy - and that is how you show your partner that you love him. Trending [All stories](https://allwomenstalk.com/stories) You Can Still Have a Crush on Someone else You may be head over heels for one special guy, but that doesn't mean you won't do a double-take on a good looking chap you see in the streets. Your hotness radar won't just disappear, you'll still feel the blood pumping for other guys! Love is a funny thing. What other things have you learned about love that most people probably don't know?

    "text": "An 18-year-old man died on Wednesday allegedly after a joyride reportedly collapsed at Nicco Park, a popular amusement park in the city, triggering panic among visitors.\nThe deceased, identified as Rahul, a resident of Muraripukur in the Ultadanga area, had arrived at the park with a group of friends around 11 a.m, police said. Witnesses reported that Rahul was on a ride when the structure malfunctioned, causing him to fall from a height along with a swing-like seat. He sustained severe head injuries and was rushed to a private hospital in Salt Lake, where doctors declared him dead.\nAccording to sources, Rahul died before reaching the hospital. The Bidhannagar South police have launched an investigation into the incident and are questioning his friends to ascertain the sequence of events. Authorities have yet to confirm the exact cause of the mechanical failure. The incident caused widespread panic at the amusement park, which was crowded with visitors at the time.\nThis is not the first time Nicco Park has faced scrutiny over ride safety. In 2012, a similar accident injured 17 people after a ride collapsed, prompting concerns over park operations.",
