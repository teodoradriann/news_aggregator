    "title": "Problems with the Vatican’s new norms for vetting supernatural phenomena",
    "text": "One of the most compelling attractions of Catholicism is the immersion in the supernatural. The Church birthed with the miracle of the resurrection. It was launched with the miracle of Pentecost. The old pagan gods of the Roman Empire gave way before the supernatural potency of the sub-Apostolic Church. Despite the best efforts of schismatics down the ages, God has renewed and refreshed his Church with infusions of the mystery of the miraculous. Protestantism has increasingly succumbed to either dull rationality or hyper-hysteria. In the Catholic world the apparitions of Our Lady remain one of the most powerful tools of renewal of piety, repentance and faith. But the supernatural is double edged. It presents us with authentic interventions, but equally with distorted and even diabolic phenomena. It is a truism that evil has the capacity to present itself as good. It is equally true that the supernatural can be mimicked. The Catholic Church has taken the task of discernment with the utmost seriousness. A good deal hangs on being able to tell good from evil and the authentic from the illusory. The last procedure for assessing the authenticity of supernatural phenomena took place in 1978. There are a number of cogent reasons for giving fresh thought to the process, as the Vatican did this month when it published new norms for vetting private revelations , of which the most persuasive is the development of social media. The new norms rightly point out that social media works to catapult ideas, experiences and news into the public space with unparalleled speed; and one of the consequences of this is the loss of space to think, pray, test and evaluate. If we evaluate the new norms from a practical perspective, they offer some sensible reasons for reviewing the norms now. But there are other perspectives which raise more complex issues and threaten to cause the faithful some anxiety. The first is that in a careful analysis of the supernatural the document begins by rightly pointing out that even authentic episodes can become tainted by abuse. It then continues sensibly: “When considering such events, one should not overlook, for example, the possibility of doctrinal errors, an oversimplification of the Gospel message, or the spread of a sectarian mentality. Finally, there is the possibility of believers being misled by an event that is attributed to a divine initiative but is merely the product of someone’s imagination, desire for novelty, tendency to fabricate falsehoods (mythomania), or inclination toward lying.” It fails to mention the additional danger of diabolic impersonation. And it is this absence of the full perspective of the supernatural that leaves the reader with the unsettling feeling that if the Vatican feels too uncomfortable even mentioning the possibility of diabolic interference, it may not be staffed with people sufficiently well-qualified theologically to tell the difference between the authentic, the anthropologically mimetic and the satanic. At one level, changing the categorisations available so that the possibility of authenticating a private revelation or an apparition no longer exists may be arguable on a pragmatic basis. “Heaven” intervenes seldom, most phenomena carry a level of ambiguity with them, and it may well be that “Nihil obstat” is an appropriately circumspect response from the centre. In fact, given the intractable problem that Medjugorje poses, one can have some sympathy for the authorities. They are faced on the one hand with a highly politicised ultra-nationalistic context, a problematically long time scale, and a library of “messages” that vary greatly in content and form; and on the other hand with enormous numbers of passionate pilgrims who want to publicise their joy and experiences that range from profound conversion to intense spiritual renewal. If these new categories are intended to side-step a problem to which there is no obvious solution, one can only be sympathetic. However, hard cases make bad law; and the whole strategy of changing the rules for one apparition would not be sensible if that was the main cause. But perhaps there are other causes? When Heaven does intervene authentically, it is usually because something is wrong and needs putting right. Many of the Marian apparitions, ranging from those like Fatima which have been fully authenticated, to Akita in Japan, or Quito in Ecuador, have at their centre a powerful rebuke for the clergy and senior prelates for having compromised, distorted or repudiated the faith. You don’t have to be cynical to think that it might be a little too convenient for those who might be or are the target of the Marian call to repentance to slip into a comfortable place of metaphysical agnosticism when it comes assessing the validity of the intervention. It is odd too for a pope who unremittingly lets it be known he wants a climate of mutual accompaniment and interdependent, reciprocal synodality, to remove the apostolic responsibility from the local bishop and restrict the power of recognition to himself. Of course the local bishop and his advisors are more likely to know the full context in which the phenomena are taking place and the consequences for good or ill that flow from it. Why would the Vatican want to remove the responsibility and authority, and restrict it to the centre in that way? Within the document the new norms allow the Vatican to retrospectively change the recognition and affirmation of an event. To do so, however, would be disastrous for the confidence of the laity. If there is a universal complaint about the present pontificate, it is the justifiable lament that it has brought with it unnecessary un-Catholic ambiguity, and flowing from that in various areas of Catholic life, something approaching chaos. Chaos and ambiguity are not recognised as fruit of the Holy Spirit. So in circumstances where the present senior hierarchy appear under-equipped to practice discernment adequately on their own ministry, these new norms will not easily deepen lay confidence in the relationship between the hierarchy of the Church and the baptised laity looking for guidance and sustenance in their prayers, and judgements seeking the renewal of the Church in a time of crisis.

    "title": "Destrozos por la DANA: qué cubren los seguros de coche y hogar por las lluvias torrenciales",
    "text": "Las lluvias torrenciales provocadas por la DANA (Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos) ha provocado estragos en toda la región y también en Mallorca, Andalucía y Tarragona. La gota fría ha afectado tanto a infraestructuras ferroviarias, con un descarrilamiento de un AVE con pasajeros con destino a Málaga y el corte de la línea Madrid-Valencia, como a ciudades completas. A cierre de este artículo, las autoridades han contabilizado a más de 155 muertos en la Comunidad Valenciana. El paso de la DANA por estas regiones se ha convertido ya en el tercer peor desastre natural de la historia de España. En casos como este, muchos hogares y automóviles se han visto impactados por el ascenso del agua. En este artículo te contamos qué cubren los seguros de ambos bienes por inundaciones extraordinarias. La cobertura del seguro dependerá de la póliza que se haya contratado, aunque hay ciertos aspectos que suelen ser comunes a todos los seguros: Daños a la estructura y bienes personales: cualquier daño que se localice en paredes, techos o cimientos suelen estar cubiertos por el seguro, así como muebles, electrodomésticos y otras pertenencias, si bien es necesario revisar los límites y las exclusiones\\n Gastos de reubicación: si debido a los daños causados por el temporal no es posible habitar en el hogar, algunas pólizas cubren los gastos de alojamiento temporal La presidenta de la Asociación de Usuarios Financieros (Asufin), Patricia Suárez, recalcó esta mañana en La 1 la importancia de verificar si existen exclusiones para comprobar los daños por este tipo de inundaciones. Si desde el seguro exigen un certificado para demostrar que se han superado los umbrales de la aseguradora, debes saber que la AEMET te lo tendrán que facilitar. Los seguros deben cubrir las reparaciones de los daños que sufran los coches cubiertos: \\\"Este tipo de reparaciones tienen unas horas por contrato y si no, te tienen que ofrecer un vehículo de sustitución\\\", explicó Suárez. Una vez más, dependerá de las condiciones del seguro. Si tienes tu seguro a todo riesgo, generalmente la póliza cubre los daños al vehículo causados por fenómenos naturales, donde se incluyen las inundaciones o deslizamientos de tierra. Ten en cuenta que puede haber una franquicia a pagar y podrá haber excepciones.",

Shakhsari is an associate professor in the Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies department. [[RELATED: Students at elite universities call for ‘intifada revolution’]]https://www.campusreform.org/article/students-at-elite-universities-call-for-intifada-revolution-/24349\n“Of course, any person who has been raped, I am a rape crisis counselor, I believe the survivors,” Shakhsari said to the panel, according to\nJewish Insider. “I am yet to see Israeli rape survivors of Hamas come and speak.”\nAccording to investigators, Hamas committed “widespread”\nsexual crimes during its recent massacre of Israelis.\nA video recording of Shakhsari’s remarks before the panel has since been\nremoved from the university’s website.\nIn an email to Campus Reform, Andria Waclawski, director of public relations at Minnesota, said that\nAmelious Whyte has received the position; He will take over the role starting on Jan. 11.\nIn the interview process, Shakhsari also suggested that the accusations that Hamas committed rape are similar to lynchings of black men in the United States because they were accused of raping white women. “We know the history of lynching, of black man, lynching, of indigenous man lynching Latinos in this country… because of accusations and they’re kind of violating the innocence of white women, right?,” she said.\n“And I think that is also this force that is repeated in the context of Israel and Palestine, because Arab men have been demonized and have been marked as monstrous people who are rapists and for violence,” she continued.\n[[RELATED: Harvard students call to ‘globalize the intifada’ during anti-Israel ‘week of action’]]https://www.campusreform.org/article/harvard-students-call-to-globalize-the-intifada-during-anti-israel-week-of-action/24431\nAccording to the Jewish Insider’s reporting, Shakhsari has been seen at rallies on campus chanting “Globalize the Intifada.” The Arabic word “intifada” means “uprising,” often used in reference to a violent uprising against Israel.\nDuring the panel meeting, Shakhsari used the word “genocide” to describe Israel’s actions. “I cannot be silenced in the face of this genocide, and I’m not gonna argue whether it’s a genocide or not,” she said.\nIn an automatic email response to Campus Reform’s request for comment, Shakhsari wrote that she stands “with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom and justice” and condemns “the Israeli state’s settler colonial violence and genocide in Gaza.”\nCampus Reform also contacted the university for comment.

    "text": "Este jueves, la Justicia condenó a 10 años de prisión a una monja por el delito de “ [abuso sexual](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/chubut-condenaron-a-14-anos-de-prision-a-un-hombre-por-abusar-sexualmente-de-su-hija/) gravemente ultrajante agravado” contra cinco adolescentes con quienes convivió en el Hogar de las Hermanas Trinitarias de Boulogne, en el partido bonaerense de San Isidro. La sentencia a cargo del Tribunal Oral en lo Criminal 1 de San Isidro, integrado por los jueces Sebastián Urquijo, Alberto Ortolani y Gonzalo Aquino recayó sobre María Tellez Fajardo (Sor Marina), de nacionalidad colombiana, quien se encontraba con prisión preventiva. De acuerdo al fallo, al que accedió Télam, Tellez Fajardo fue encontrada culpable por ser “autora penalmente responsable del delito de [abuso sexual](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/gromming-y-abuso-sexual-infantil-condenaron-a-un-hombre-a-11-anos-de-prision/) gravemente ultrajante agravado por tratarse de una persona encargada de la guarda y contra menores de 18 años y aprovechando la situación de convivencia preexistente, su relación de autoridad y que las víctimas no haya podido consentir libremente el accionar”. Los abusos se produjeron contra cinco adolescentes de entre 12 a 17 años durante 2017 y 2021 en el Hogar ubicado en la calle Carlos Tejedor número 348. En noviembre, la querella había solicitado una condena de 15 años de prisión y la fiscalía, otra de 10. El juez Aquino consideró en la sentencia que “lo que ha quedado probado aquí es que la imputada no protagonizó un acto aislado, fugaz, discontinuo o sorpresivo en perjuicio de sus víctimas”. “Inexorablemente tal circunstancia configura una mayor ofensa a la dignidad e integridad sexual, moral y personal de las damnificadas, que sufrieron un grado de degradación o vejación superior al del abuso sexual simple”, remarcó el magistrado al referirse al período de entre “2 y 5 años”. Es que, para el juez, “es evidente que María Tellez Farjado actuó desde una posición de aprovechamiento de convivencia preexistente con las menores desde que eran nada menos que niñas institucionalizadas en un Hogar de la Congregación de la cual la misma era parte, y que los abusos se consumaban en la propia casa - Hogar donde la imputada junto” a las víctimas “compartían la vida en común”. Esta situación “permitió la comisión de los hechos ventilados en el presente legajo y de la cual se valió la primera para lograr sus objetivos -que no eran otros más que satisfacer sus propios deseos sexuales- en ocasión que se encontraba a solas con las criaturas”. Una de las víctimas, que cuando sucedían los hechos tenía 14 años, declaró en el juicio que los “cinco o seis” hechos de abuso ocurrieron en la cocina donde ella trabajaba. La abogada de una de las víctimas relató que la adolescente le había comentado lo ocurrido a la directora del hogar -Sor Silvia Challu- y que ella “le respondió que iban a esperar una señal divina que le indiquen que era lo que tenían que hacer, una señal de Dios”. De acuerdo a los declarado en el debate por la licenciada en Psicología del Centro de Atención a la Víctima de la Fiscalía General de San Isidro, Sonia Oettel, otra de las víctimas “describió que la actitud del hogar era de tapar todo, que ella había recurrido a Sor Silvia para contarle lo de Marina pero que descreyó de ella y la trató de mentirosa”. Otra de las víctimas señaló, según el testimonio de Oettel, que todas las jóvenes le hablaron “de la misma persona denunciada” y que los abusos se daban en la cocina del Hogar y en una dependencia que el lugar tenía por fuera dentro del mismo predio. En uno de los casos, la adolescente, luego de sufrir dos episodios de abusos, dijo haberse sentido muy triste tras de lo ocurrido y comenzó a “autoagredirse a través de cortes en sus brazos”, por lo que tuvo que ser hospitalizada. Sor Marina llegó a esa residencia en mayo de 2017 y en abril de 2021 se concretó la primera denuncia y fue detenida el 10 de junio de 2022. Con información de Agencia Télam",

    "text": "Pakistanis protested against the Supreme Court's top judge after he issued a ruling related to blasphemy / © AFP\nThousands of Pakistanis protested against the Supreme Court's top judge on Friday, after he issued a ruling related to blasphemy that sparked online backlash and thinly veiled death threats.\nA campaign targeting Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa began after he ordered the release of a man from the Ahmadi religious sect, considered heretical by hardline Muslim scholars.\nThe man had been accused of disseminating a forbidden Ahmadi text, which firebrand clerics consider tantamount to blasphemy –- an incendiary issue in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where even unproven allegations of offending Islam have sparked violence.\nAround 3,000 people gathered at rallies across the northwestern city of Peshawar after Friday prayers.\nCrowds blocked roads and chanted \"Death to Qadianis\" -- a slur referring to Ahmadis -- as well as \"Long live Islam\".\nThe Supreme Court issued a statement on Thursday evening defending his ruling, denying that it went against the Islamic constitution of Pakistan.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa ordered the release of a man from the Ahmadi religious sect, considered heretical by hardline Muslims / © AFP\n\"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" it said. \"The organised campaign against judiciary and judges is unfortunate.\"\nA spokesman for Pakistan's Ahmadi community, Amir Mahmood, told AFP that \"one-sided negative propaganda is being spread against this judgement\" which protected a man from \"being persecuted for his religious belief\".\nIsa's ruling first went unnoticed two weeks ago, before it was highlighted by social media accounts linked to the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party behind violent anti-blasphemy protests.\nPosts calling for him to resign have been shared thousands of times on social media.\nThe Pakistani chapter of the Taliban militant group -- known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- called Isa \"an enemy of Islam\" and \"a damned man\".\n- Damned for their faith -\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said Isa's ruling \"protects the constitutional right of all religious minorities to freedom of religion or belief\".\nThe Pakistan Human Rights Commission said Isa's ruling \"protects the constitutional right of all religious minorities to freedom of religion or belief\" / © AFP\n\"Those political leaders and sections of the media that are responsible for this campaign must be restrained,\" the organisation said on social media platform X.\nAhmadis have been discriminated against and persecuted for decades in Pakistan, because of their belief in a 19th century prophet after Muhammad.\nThe second amendment of Pakistan's constitution, made in 1974, declares Ahmadis non-Muslims.\nThe law also prohibits them from professing to be Muslims or spreading their faith, and allows the death penalty for those found guilty of insulting Islam.\nIn his judgement, Isa ruled that according to the constitution, \"every citizen shall have the right to profess, practice and propagate his religion\".\n\"Freedom of faith is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam. But sadly, in matters of religion, tempers flare up and the Qur'anic mandate is forsaken,\" he added.\nHe also said the book allegedly disseminated by the accused had not been outlawed at the time of the alleged crime in 2019.\nCleric Fazlur Rehman, the influential leader of the conservative religious party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, said Isa's reasoning was \"false and based on bad intentions\".\nIn 2011, the governor of eastern Punjab province was killed by his bodyguard after calling for reforms to the stringent blasphemy laws that Ahmadis frequently fall foul of.\nnz-la-cyb-jts/ecl/dhw",
