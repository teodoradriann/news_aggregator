    "text": "New Delhi: \"Be proud that you are the wife of a soldier, the highest honour anybody can get in this country,\" Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murty on Thursday told members of Army Wives Welfare Association here.\nThe engineer-turned-philanthropist in an interaction with the women at Manekshaw Centre in Delhi Cantonment also said the honour that their husbands get through their contribution to protecting the nation is 'divided by two', saying one half belongs to him (husband) and the other to you (wife).\nMurty, 73, the former chairperson of Infosys Foundation and the author of several books, mostly for children, on Thursday took oath as Rajya Sabha MP in the presence of her husband N R Narayana Murthy.\n\"Be proud about your husband, they are protecting the nation. And all that honour is divided by two, half to them and half to you. Be proud that you are the wife of a soldier, the highest honour anybody can get in this country,\" she told the gathering.\nDuring the interaction, she said she gets thousands of invitations to attend events but her work schedule doesn't allow her to attend most of them, 'but I tell my secretary that if it is (an invitation) from the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, then, never say no. Because, I have a duty towards them'.\nSudha Murty takes oath as Rajya Sabha MP Murty also gave some parenting lessons to the women in the audience and asked them to use 'HR skills' they use in their lives to raise their children.\n'...Like unique stripes of a zebra, every child is unique. You have two children, they are different. So, you have to use your HR skills on children. And, women have best HR skills,' she said.\nIn her address, she told the gathering of AWWA members that women in different stages of their lives, from a daughter to a mother, and sister to a mother-in-law 'have handled many HR relations but you are aware they are not HR relations. And, that technique you should use to bring up your children'.\n'You should not give them (children) money, as much as possible; children are not experienced. You should not pamper them too much, because life is hard...,' she added.\nMurty, who was the first woman engineer to have worked with TELCO, is famously known to have provided the seed capital of Rs 10,000 from her emergency funds to her husband to start Infosys, which now has a market cap of over $80 billion.\nShe is also renowned for her contribution to Kannada and English literature and is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Bal Sahitya Puraskar, the Padma Shri (2006) and the Padma Bhushan (2023).\nOn a question on which issues she would raise in Parliament, Murty said, \"Let me understand... the very first day I am going to school, how will I answer other questions. Let me understand, let me study, when the times comes, you will get to know.\" Asked how she felt about this achievement, the engineer-turned-philanthropist quipped, \"I am always neutral, I am happy. Let it come, let it (session) start. I don't speculate so much. As it comes, I will take it.\"",

    "title": "Breakfast With The Beatles Celebrates 40th Anniversary - 2023 In Review",
    "text": "Breakfast With The Beatles Celebrates 40th Anniversary was a top 23 story of Aug 2023: (mfh) On December 17 of this year, Breakfast With The Beatles will broadcast its 2080th weekly episode during its 40th consecutive year on the air in Los Angeles. This extraordinary milestone is concurrent with the 60th anniversary of the birth of Beatlemania in the US, when \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" started receiving regular airplay a few months in advance of the band's first stateside tour. Breakfast With The Beatles, now on KLOS and hosted by Chris Carter, is the longest continually running Beatles-themed radio program in the world. Original host Deirdre O'Donoghue created Breakfast with the Beatles (BWTB) in mid-December 1983 on KMET in Los Angeles, eventually moving to KLSX. After O'Donoghue's untimely passing in 2001, the show was hosted \"audition-style\" by several guest hosts including Chris Carter who was then overwhelmingly voted-in by show listeners. In 2006, BWTB moved to its current home at KLOS-FM and is heard every Sunday from 9:00 AM to Noon. Shortly after the move, Carter made his SiriusXM radio debut in 2008, bringing BWTB first to Little Steven's Underground Garage channel and then, in 2017, being chosen by The Beatles Channel to host the show weekday mornings at 8:00 AM ET. This is not simply a re-broadcast of the KLOS show, but a completely separate entity with unique playlists. Add to that Carter's British Invasion show on SiriusXM (Saturdays at Noon ET, rebroadcast Sundays at 4:00 PM ET on Little Steven's Underground Garage channel) and he is playing The Beatles almost literally eight days a week. Chris Carter conservatively estimates he has played The Beatles and Beatles-related songs more than a quarter million times on terrestrial and satellite radio combined, making him an unofficial record holder of sorts. \"It has been an honor to serve as steward of Breakfast With The Beatles all these years,\" said Carter, who also co-founded New Jersey-based alternative rock band Dramarama and served as the band's bassist for thirteen years starting in 1981. \"The music of The Beatles is eternal, and thus, it enables the radio show to endure and thrive. John, Paul, George and Ringo, in a sense, gave me the best job in the world. I have no doubt BWTB will last at least another 40 years, and most likely much longer.\" Over the last four decades, Breakfast With The Beatles has had on its fair share of guests who are integral to The Beatles story and legacy, including Ringo Starr, Sir George Martin, Julian Lennon, Pete Best, Billy Preston, Olivia Harrison, Dhani Harrison, Pattie Boyd, Brian Wilson, Peter Asher, May Pang, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voormann, Eric Idle and Sir Paul McCartney, who described Breakfast With The Beatles as \"the Rolls Royce of radio shows.\" \"40 years.. crazy! I want to thank you for putting all that work in for us,\" commented Ringo Starr before jokingly quipping, \"Time you moved on. Just having fun at your expense. Thanks a lot, Chris, and have a great 40-year party on the show. Peace and love.\" Check out the show's official page [here](https://www.955klos.com/breakfast-with-the-beatles/).

    "title": "State Fair of Texas to ban guns, tighten security one year after a shooting that injured 3 people | KERA News",
    "text": "The State Fair of Texas will ban all firearms from fairgrounds and tighten security at fair entrances during the upcoming event, officials announced Thursday — about a year after an alleged gunman opened fire on the fairgrounds and injured three people. The annual security update, in which fair officials were joined by the Dallas Police Department, DART police and Dallas ISD police, came earlier than usual. It’s been almost a year since one man shot at another in the food court at the Tower Building around 7:45 p.m. Oct. 14, Dallas police said. Victims had non-life-threatening injuries. Karissa Condoianis, senior vice president of public relations for the State Fair, said because the investigation did not determine how the alleged gunman got the weapon into the fair, “we may never know” how it happened. “We are putting measures in place to ensure that we are doing everything in our power to make it not happen again,” she said. Police arrested 22-year-old Cameron Turner in connection with the shooting. He’s charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and one count of unlawfully carrying a weapon in a prohibited place. Days after the shooting, State Fair officials said there were no planned security policy changes, but the fair would put increased security at the gates and throughout the park. Now, all firearms are banned from fairgrounds, including concealed carry. While the alleged shooter did not have a license to carry a gun, Condoianis said officials felt this was the right move based on feedback and procedures at other Texas fairs and rodeos. “We accept people’s rights, and we are in support of those,” she said. “This is just a measure to create a further family-friendly atmosphere.” Andrea Araujo, a victim who was working as part of the fair’s cleaning crew when she was shot last year, is suing the alleged gunman, GXC Inc. and Andy Frain Services . Her attorney told KERA News in June Araujo still has bullet fragments in her body. According to the suit, the security screening checkpoint run by Andy Frain Services failed to prevent Turner from entering fairgrounds with the pistol he allegedly used in the shooting. Screening devices from GXC Inc. also failed to detect the weapon and alert personnel, the suit alleged. GXC Inc., a security company, will once again supply the fair with CEIA Opengate weapon detectors at entrances. Visitors will now see signage informing them their bags will be searched, as well as a list of prohibited items and the guest code of conduct. The company's CEO, Genaro Cavazos, said it hasn’t been determined the gun was taken through a metal detector at the fair, and that he still trusts CEIA’s technology. \"My life is protection,\" Cavazos said. \"I chose a technology that I know I could trust with my own family. If somebody walks a weapon through it, I have the utmost confidence that it’s going to detect it.\" Andy Frain Services will also return to provide security officers at fair entrances and to check bags. Officials would not disclose exactly how many security officers will be at this year’s fair. When asked, officials said they weren’t aware of any visitors walking around metal detectors but said fairgoers should let law enforcement know if they see that happening. Other changes at this year's state fair: - The fair will have cameras at entrances to record the security process. - Bags and soft-shell coolers must now be 9 inches by 10 inches by 12 inches or smaller. Medical or parenting bags don’t have to meet those limits. - The fair will no longer provide lockers or bag checks. Fairgoers who bring a too-large bag or another prohibited item will have to return it to their vehicle or dispose of it. Staff won’t hold prohibited items. Clear bags encouraged, but not required. A rule that will remain the same: all children aged 17 or under must come to the fair with an adult aged 21 or older after 5 p.m. Adults cannot accompany more than six children and must present their ID when entering the fair. The State Fair of Texas hadn't seen a shooting like last year's since 1988 , when one person was killed and three others were shot. Last year’s incident was traumatizing and devastating for staff, who are at the fair every day it’s open, Condoianis said. \"Just know that the team here is so passionate about the state fair and about creating this environment so that this is a place where you can continue to come to get away from the rest of the noise in the world,\" she said. The State Fair of Texas opens Sept. 27. Got a tip? Email Toluwani Osibamowo at [tosibamowo@kera.org](mailto:tosibamowo@kera.org). You can follow Toluwani on X @tosibamowo .

    "title": "Cow Print Fashion Trend for Fall 2024: 8 Styles to Get the Look",
    "text": "Every season, without fail, an animal print rises to the top of the fashion food chain. Last winter, for example, was all about mob wife -inspired leopard print . But this fall, fashionistas are trading it in for an even cooler, if not a bit unexpected, pattern that totally embraces a Western aesthetic. Yes, I'm talking about Cowboy Core cow print, and mark my words, it's about to take over fall fashion . So, grab your cowboy boots and get ready to channel Aly and AJ in Cow Belles in the most literal sense, because cattle print is totally the moo-d. Moo-ve over, leopard print PureWow editors select every item that appears on this page, and the company may earn compensation through affiliate links within the story. All prices are accurate upon date of publish. You can learn more about the affiliate process here . Every season, without fail, an animal print rises to the top of the fashion food chain. Last winter, for example, was all about Why Is Cow Print So Popular Right Now? There are many reasons why cow print is so popular right now, starting with my guess that trendsetters are experiencing a wave of leopard-print fatigue. Of course, it was only a matter of time before cow print reigned supreme. Thanks to Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé's country album , the Western aesthetic has been at the forefront in 2024—see also: the rise in brown suede boots and handbags . And with cow print being the epitome of yee-haw style, it only makes sense that it would have a *huge* moment this year. How to Nail the Trend The cow print fashion trend is super easy to incorporate into your capsule wardrobe , given that cowhide often has an earth-toney palette that can easily be paired with fall neutrals like beige, black and brown. So when you find yourself reaching for a pop of print to go with your basics, resist the urge to go leopard and grab a cow-print option instead. In other words, skip your basic black silk skirt and make a statement with this rodeo-ready cow-print one . Or, just scoop up these Tory Burch Mellow studded mules ($328), which are guaranteed to take your fall fits to Bey-approved heights. Ready to get your cowgirl style on? I've rounded up eight styles that will help you pull off the cow print trend before anyone else. Giddy up! Want to know which buzzy products are *really* worth buying? Sign up for our shopping newsletter to uncover our favorite finds. 1. Tory Burch Mellow Studded Mules Tory Burch For those looking to soft launch the pattern in their OOTDs, look no further than these beautiful Tory Burch mules that will add a subtle, glamorous touch of it. Crafted from calf hair and leather, and featuring a gold hardware logo and studs for polished edge, it's safe to say they're as luxe as can be. But are they as comfortable as they are effortlessly cowgirl chic? All signs point to *yes,* especially since they have a flexible sole and suede-lined cork footbed, which one buyer says feels \"marvelously cozy\" on their feet. 2. Free People We The Free Calico Flannel Shirt Free People If there's ever a time not to pull out your go-to plaid flannel shirt, it's now. Instead, you should scoop up this cow-printed pick, which will give any fall fit some wild and Western flair. It has contrast seams and cuffed sleeves, as well as a collared neckline and pockets on the chest, so rest assured that Free People thought of everything when creating this layerable style—even down to the material, which is 100 percent cotton and 100 percent soft and comfy, per reviewers. Allegra K Trade in your basic denim skirt for this cow-print mini, and you're guaranteed to bring in the compliments 'til the cows come home. I love that it has elastic in the back for some stretch at the waist, while the brand says that its cotton fabrication \"ensures all-day comfort without compromising on style.\" And that's all that really matters, right? Well, besides the fact it's on sale at Target for as low as $31 RN! 4. Renee C Satin Cow-Print Skirt Renee C PureWow Editorial Assistant (and fashion guru) Courtney Mason recently gave us a lesson on slip skirts that proves we can incorporate the style into our wardrobes year-round. That's moo-sic to my ears when it comes to styling this on-trend option. Whether you want to keep it casual with sneakers and a knit top, dress it up with a classic button down or give it a demure twist with a tailored vest, the possibilities are endless. But here's why one buyer is obsessed with this satin piece: \"I really like that this is thicker satin and not paper thin like a lot of skirts on the market! This is the perfect addition to my work wardrobe. I’m 5-foot-4, and this skirt is the perfect length. Fits true to size.\" Sounds like it's petite-approved to boot! Getting all dressed up for a (cow)girls' night on the town? This slinky maxi will definitely get you noticed, and it's not just because it has a cool cow-print design that'll stand out in a sea of LBDs. The high neck, slim fit and cheeky cutout trim are sure to wrangle up a few head-turns in the best way. 6. WDIRARA Cow-Print Wide-Leg Jeans WDIRARA Just wait—all the cool girlies will be wearing cow-print pants this fall, so why not get ahead of the trend with these wide-leg jeans? They've earned nearly 400 5-star reviews thanks to their supposedly soft, non-stretch fabric, and there's a high chance they'll make you look snatched in all the right places. But of course, I still hit up the review section to see what they're really all about. \"The material is very nice and feels just like a rough denim. They are definitely high-wasted and fell exactly where they do on the model,\" writes one reviewer. \"They stopped right at the base of my ankle, and the flare is just as shown in the photo. I bought them for a concert and can't wait to wear them!\" Um, same, which is why I'm adding them to my cart before they sell out. 7. Aerosoles Pull-On Western Booties Aerosoles Nothing says Cowboy Core quite like a good pair of Western-inspired booties, and these certainly fit the bill. Not to mention, they'll probably be a lot more comfortable than your typical cowboy boots—they are designed by Aerosoles, after all. Between their diamond flex outsole and an OrthoLite Aerofly removable footbed, these boots are designed to offer optimal cushioning and support. So, yeah, you can say they're made for walkin', two-steppin' and everything in between. Cyrus Want an easy, low-commitment way to try out the trend? Just throw it over your shoulders in the form of a cardigan, like this number that boasts a cool, geometric-take on cow print. Not only is the oversized style totally budget-friendly ( Maxxinistas already know ), but I imagine it's also as soft and cozy as it looks due to its knit blend of rayon, polyester and nylon. And, yes, it has two front pockets, so you can keep small items on hand while you lounge around the house or head out for the day.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (7News) — Nearly one in three Americans wears a fitness device. These watches, which track your health and fitness, are designed to do everything from monitor your heart rate and count your steps, to analyze your sleep and remind you to move.\nIn the last decade, sales have skyrocketed with more than half a billion sold just in 2024.\nBut the very devices we rely on to help us stay healthy may pose a hazard.\n“We discovered of these 22 watch bands that we looked at, that there was PFAS in many of them,” said physicist Dr Graham Peaslee.\nRELATED | [We found toxins in school lunches. Key US Senators want to reach across aisle to fix it](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/washington-dc-toxic-chemicals-student-kids-children-school-lunches-pfas-pesticides-heavy-metals-lawmakers-senators-john-fetterman-interview-congress-action-safety-public-health-maryland-virginia-developmental-delays-liver-disease-cancer)\n[Peaslee studies contaminants in textiles at Notre Dame](https://news.nd.edu/news/researchers-detect-elevated-levels-of-pfas-in-some-fitness-tracker-and-smartwatch-bands/) and since 2018 has focused on PFAS chemicals, often found in water-resistant products from clothing to accessories.\n[A new report ](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00907#)reveals some sports watch bands contain PFAS chemicals tied to everything from cancer and infertility to autoimmune disease.\nWe sat down with Peaslee to talk about his findings.\nLisa Fletcher: “Are there any of the levels of the toxins in the watch products you tested so high that you think the manufacturer should be taking action or the product should be recalled?”\nDr Graham Peaslee: “I think the levels are so high that we shouldn't be using this material.”\nPeaslee got the idea of testing watch bands while reading the newspaper.\n“We saw an ad in the newspaper advertising a fluoroelastomer watch band. And i said, ‘Oooh, fluoroelastomer, that's a PFAS, why would they be advertising that?’” said Peaslee.\nFluoroelastomer helps makes watch bands more comfortable and resistant to water, oils and sweat, making them a popular choice among consumers.\n“It presents an exposure risk to those people who are wearing it,” said Peaslee. “It's not just a one-time user effect. Users wear these smart watches and fitness bands for 12 hours at a time or longer, even when they're sweating for example.”\nIncreasing the risk of the chemicals entering your body.\nREAD MORE | [EPA sets first-ever limits on toxic PFAS in America's drinking water](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/epa-pfas-forever-chemicals-toxic-drinking-water-standards-america-sets-limits-environmental-protection-agency-water-filters-district-of-columbia-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-virginia-maryland-dc)\n“Chemicals move more quickly in heat,” said Peaslee. “The sweat pores open more when you're in actual healthy activities. All these PFAS transfer through the skin and they go through the surface and stick in the skin or they go all the way through to the blood.”\nAlong with finding more common PFAS, Peaslee's study identified a unique, single PFAS of particular concern: PFHxA. It was found in \"very high concentrations\" in his tests. And while the European Union has effectively banned the chemical, it is unregulated in the United States.\nThis, is despite the recent EPA finding that PFHxA can affect the liver, blood cells and endocrine systems.\n“It doesn't accumulate in your blood the way other PFAS do,” said Peaslee. “It's not in blood serum. It's in whole blood. So, it sticks to the red blood cells of your blood.\" Peaslee says this is why it was originally thought that PFHxA not as concerning - because it wasn't showing up in traditional blood tests. It was not until a Swedish scientist started testing whole blood that its presence and accumulation was recognized. In fact, the team discovered PFHxA was the third-most-common PFAS found in whole blood.\nSEE MORE | [Maryland bill to eliminate dangerous PFAS chemicals found in common pesticides](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/dangerous-pfas-forever-chemicals-common-pesticides-maryland-agriculture-cancer-health-problems-safety-bill-legislation-climate-change-food-steven-lasee-texas-tech-senator-brian-feldman)\nAvoiding the chemicals means knowing what to look for.\n“How can the consumer avoid it? Well, in this case, it comes with a label,” said Peaslee. “It's called a price tag. The more expensive ones are more likely to contain this “wonderful” chemical, and the cheaper ones, the under $15 ones didn't have it at all.”\n“This is why we publish the papers because I’m trying to convince not just the consumer, but also the people who make these products that if we don't have an alternative, let's make one,” said Peaslee. “Most companies once they realize what they've done will switch away from it. But I would like these things to be gone.”",
