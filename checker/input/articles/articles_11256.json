    "text": "The US army has confirmed that the man who [murdered a Louth woman at her home in New York](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41270170.html) was a former soldier. Denise Morgan, from Tullyallen suffered a gunshot wound to the head and neck during a row with her former partner Joed A Taveras in Queens on October 21. The mother of one had ended the relationship and was preparing to move to a new apartment with her daughter when she died. When police arrived on the scene, they discovered the remains of Ms Morgan and Mr Tavaras, who had turned the gun on himself. In a statement, the US army press office told thethat Mr Tavaras held a previous position of “specialist” within the defence forces. “He held the rank of specialist at the end of service,\" it said. “Due to Privacy Act constraints, we are unable to provide the characterization of discharge for any soldier. “Army policy controls a current soldier’s access to government firearms and participation in live fire exercises but does not extend to possession of personal firearms by former soldiers.\" An online obituary for Mr Tavaras said he served four years as a tanker, deploying in 2013, before he was “dishonourably discharged”. Ms Morgan’s family previously told thethat they will “never get justice” for Denise, but that they wanted to warn others about the dangers of controlling behaviours. Lisa Morgan said: “He was trying to cut her off from people. “I was though, afraid of what he would do if he knew Denise was leaving. There were red flags and we knew he was controlling. But no one expected this. We just hope that people will be careful when they are leaving an abusive relationship because she was living with him for five years. You would never see this coming.\"",

    "text": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren\nVANCOUVER — British Columbia’s abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb’s trails are open, while Vancouver’s Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver’s three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are “definitely behind the 8-ball” because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n“All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,” Shalman said.\n“This is not something where you can make up what you’re down during Christmas break. You won’t make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.”\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n“I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,” he says. “We’re Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.”\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of “thin snow coverage” for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n“Rain’s the star of the show today,” Cypress Mountain’s update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a “blocking pattern” across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like “a wall.”\nHe said Environment Canada’s long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n“We may see potential for some snowfall,” Proctor says. “But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",
