    "text": "By Capt. Lindsey Heflin 53rd Wing Public Affairs EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AFNS) — Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin presented Maj. Stephen Keck, 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron F-15E Strike Eagle pilot, the 2022 Mackay Trophy on Jan. 11, 2024, at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. “Major Keck’s inspiring actions reflect exactly what it takes to be a stellar Airman and aviator — ingenuity, tenacity, and audacity,” Allvin said. “Moreover, any time your name is on a trophy alongside the likes of Hap Arnold, Eddie Rickenbacker and Chuck Yeager, you have done something truly special.” Keck received this honor for his actions while serving as the Defensive Counter-Air Team Lead for the 335th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron during a mission at an undisclosed location. While supporting a special operations team in contested enemy territory, Keck and weapons system officer Lt. Col. John Rabun identified a critical error during ingress that would have given away the task force’s position. In response, Keck and Rabun corrected the error by being proactive and shifting to a more aggressive posture of their forces. During the mission, Keck also identified an adversary aircraft in the contested airspace and initiated an intercept to ensure the safety of ground forces. Ultimately, the success of the operation resulted in the capture of a senior terrorist leader. “The team I worked with during the mission was outstanding,” Keck said. “When we flew that night, we had a very well developed and understood game plan that enabled our ability to operate at our best. Flying alongside other folks at the top of their game ready to use their capabilities to fight our enemies and protect our allies was an awesome feeling.” Awarded for the “most meritorious flight of the year” by an Air Force individual, group, or organization, the Mackay Trophy is one of the longest-standing aviation awards in the nation having first been given to 2nd Lt. Henry H. “Hap” Arnold in 1912. Presented by the Air Force chief of staff annually, the Mackay Trophy is remarkable in that the achievements inscribed on the base of the trophy symbolize the growth of American military aviation from its beginnings to now. The trophy is housed on permanent display at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.",

As we celebrate 20 years of inspiring and equipping the next generation, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners, sponsors, volunteers, educators, and staff whose unwavering support has been instrumental in achieving our mission and driving lasting impact across the Kingdom.”\nThe winning teams of the \"2025 Company of the Year\" awards will represent Bahrain at the regional Young Entrepreneurs competition organised by Injaz Al Arab in November 2025 that will be held in Egypt, showcasing their achievements on a broader stage. -\nTradeArabia News Service\nRelated posts\nCloud Spaces opens largest workspace at Downtown Dubai\nLondon Business School to start open education programme in Riyadh\nTamkeen invites applications for Bahraini entrepreneurship program\nMKF seals strategic partnerships for Takeoff career expo\nVatel Bahrain participates in GCC Training & Education Exhibition in Al Ain\nBahrain Airport Services honours over 160 top employees\nGeneral Assembly Bahrain, KPMG partner to empower tech workforce\nVatel Bahrain holds roadshow across Saudi Arabia\nVolvo CE expands Iron Women programme to India\nZain Bahrain signs up Lumofy to upskill its employees",

    "title": "Polémica por unha campaña sobre o consumo de drogas: \"cambia de fosa nasal de ca...",
    "text": "Unha campaña da federación Casals de Joves de Catalunya para reducir riscos á hora de tomar drogas creou polémica porque consiste nuns cartóns co título 'T-Drogues', que emulan as do transporte público e que conteñen indicacións para ter unha \"experiencia máis segura\" ao consumir. Así, o cartón 'T-Drogues' inclúe recomendacións para o consumo da cocaína como \"pica ben o que vaias tomar para unha experiencia máis segura\", \"cambia de fosa nasal de cando en vez\", \"límpate con auga morna o serum o nariz logo de cada viaxe\" ou \"os 'turulos' -para esnifar- son de uso unipersonal e intransferible\". A campaña, que se iniciou en 2021, está impulsada por Casals de Joves de Catalunya -que agrupa diferentes organizacións xuvenís- co asesoramento de Energy Control, un programa de intervención a partir da redución de risco no consumo recreativo de droga da Asociación Benestar e Desenvolvemento (ABD). Nun comunicado, ABD indicou que supervisou a campaña de Casals de Joves hai tres anos para axustar as mensaxes á súa filosofía de redución de riscos, que implica \"identificar, avaliar e xestionar os factores de risco para previr ou reducir ao mínimo os seus potenciais danos\". A campaña da federación Casals de Joves consistiu na edición destes cartóns informativos dirixidas a mozos consumidores que se repartiron en eventos e actos concretos, co obxectivo de dar información, tomar conciencia e sobre todo axudar a reducir os riscos. ABD matizou que este tipo de material informativo \"sempre vai dirixido a persoas que utilizan sustancias psicoactivas\" e repártese en espazos onde se produce o consumo. Polo tanto, \"en ningún caso pódese considerar que as mensaxes de redución de riscos induzan ao consumo, xa que se dirixen exclusivamente a persoas que xa están a consumir\", engadiu a organización. Pola súa banda, Casals de Joves sinalou noutro comunicado que é unha campaña destinada a novos adultos, de 18 a 30 anos, que consomen drogas. A organización salientou que os cartóns se entregan \"unicamente a poboación usuaria ou a persoas educadoras que traballan con esta poboación\", polo que é \"un material especializado dirixido a un público específico\". Ademais, a entrega do material acompáñase de asesoramento e formación no uso das drogas para previr condutas de risco e problemáticas, segundo Casals de Joves. Aínda que a campaña non é nova, suscitou debate nas redes sociais o día 28 e foi criticada polo presidente do Colexio Oficial de Médicos de Barcelona, Jaume Padrós, quen afirmou na rede X (antes Twitter) que está \"estupefacto\". Tamén o epidemiólogo do Hospital Clínic Antoni Trilla afirmou na mesma rede que \"campañas pouco afortunadas como esta poñen de manifesto un déficit notable de sentido común e rigor para previr problemas de saúde tan graves como os derivados do consumo de drogas\". Pola súa banda, o líder do PP no Concello de Barcelona, Daniel Sirera, pediu ao alcalde Jaume Collboni que retire o apoio do consistorio á federación Casals de Joves de Catalunya.",

    "text": "Hyundai has successfully acquired General Motors India's manufacturing plant in Talegaon, Maharashtra, marking a significant step for the automaker. The second-largest car manufacturer in India, Hyundai Motor, has confirmed the completion of the acquisition and revealed its plans to invest Rs 6,000 crore in the state of Maharashtra. This investment is part of an agreement between Hyundai and the state government, formalized in Davos. The acquisition process was finalized after meeting specific conditions and obtaining regulatory approvals from relevant government bodies and stakeholders, according to a statement from Hyundai Motor India. Emphasizing the importance of the Indian market, Hyundai Motor India's MD & CEO, Un Soo Kim, expressed the company's commitment to delivering cutting-edge products and technologies to Indian customers. Looking ahead to the next decade, Kim highlighted the need to enhance manufacturing capacity in India. The Talegaon manufacturing plant is poised to play a crucial role in achieving Hyundai Motor India Ltd's milestone of reaching an annual production capacity of 1 million units. Kim affirmed that this acquisition aligns with the company's commitment to Atmanirbhar Bharat, making India a hub for advanced smart mobility solutions. Hyundai Motor India plans to commence manufacturing operations at the Talegaon plant in 2025, with the facility currently having an annual production capacity of 1.3 lakh units. To achieve its strategic goals in the market, the company aims to expand its annual production capacity and will make phased investments to upgrade the existing infrastructure and manufacturing equipment at the plant. It's noteworthy that General Motors ceased car sales in India at the end of 2017 after over two decades of operation. The Talegaon plant, originally intended to be sold to Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors, became part of Hyundai's plans after the Chinese company withdrew from entering the Indian market last year.

    "text": "LONDON, United Kingdom — The powerful Auschwitz-set psychological horror film, \"The Zone of Interest\", which on Sunday won the Oscar for best international film, stunned critics with its penetrating study of the banality in the shadow of the death camp.\nThe victory marks the first time that a submission from Britain has won the Academy Award in this category, which is open to non-English language films made by countries other than the United States.\n\"Our film shows where dehumanisation leads at its worst. It's shaped all of our past and present,\" said British director Jonathan Glazer as he accepted the award, before issuing a strong statement about the conflict in Gaza.\n\"Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people,\" said Glazer, who is Jewish.\n\"Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel, or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanisation, how do we resist?\"\nThe German-language film, which earned a total of five Oscar nods and won three BAFTAs, focuses on the family of Rudolf Hoess, the longest-serving commandant of the Auschwitz camp, who lived a stone's throw from the gas chambers.\nWhile the screams and gunshots are audible from their beautiful garden, Hoess (Christian Friedel), his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hueller, an Oscar nominee for \"Anatomy of a Fall\") and their children carry on as though nothing is amiss.\nThey pull the curtains to mask the rising smoke from the incinerators, they use their pool -- life carries on, even when the death trains arrive to disgorge their doomed passengers.\nAt one point, Hedwig samples a lipstick she found in the pocket of a fur coat stripped from a gassed woman. She rejoices when she finds a diamond in a confiscated tube of toothpaste.\nThe horror \"is just bearing down on every pixel of every shot, in sound and how we interpret that sound... It affects everything but them,\" Glazer told AFP at last year's Cannes film festival where 'Zone' won the Grand Prix, the runner-up prize.\n\"Everything had to be very carefully calibrated to feel that it was always there -- this ever-present, monstrous machinery,\" he said.\nHedwig's mother eventually recoils at what is happening beyond the house's walls, but most of the family's friends and acquaintances are utterly indifferent.\nThe 58-year-old Glazer focused on the apparent normality of daily lives around the death camp, viewing Hoess's family not as obvious monsters but as terrifyingly ordinary.\n\"The things that drive these people are familiar -- nice house, nice garden, healthy kids,\" he said.\n\"How like them are we?\"\nThe \"zone of interest\" is what the Nazis called the 40-square-kilometre area surrounding Auschwitz. The film is based on Martin Amis' 2014 novel of the same name.\nThe film has earned near-universal acclaim, with The Hollywood Reporter calling it a \"bone-chilling Holocaust drama like no other\", and Variety hailing it as \"profound, meditative and immersive\".\nBut some criticised Glazer for not showing Auschwitz itself, the largest Nazi concentration camp where more than 1.1 million people, most of them Jewish, lost their lives, according to the site's museum.\n'I cogitate a lot' The director is known for taking his time: \"The Zone of Interest\" came a decade after his last film, the acclaimed, deeply strange sci-fi \"Under the Skin\" (2013) starring Scarlett Johansson.\nGlazer first made his name with music videos for Radiohead, Blur and Massive Attack in the 1990s before moving into films with \"Sexy Beast\" (2000) and \"Birth\" (2004).\n\"I cogitate a lot. I think a lot about what I'm going to make, good or bad,\" he said.\n\"This particular subject obviously is a vast, profound topic and deeply sensitive for many reasons and I couldn't just approach it casually.\"\nBeyond Amis' novel, Glazer spent two years reading other books and accounts on the subject before beginning to map out the film with collaborators.\nThe film bested \"Perfect Days\" from Wim Wenders, \"The Teachers' Lounge\", \"Society of the Snow\" and \"Io Capitano\" for the Oscar.",

Pero podemos anticipar que todas ellas debilitan el marco institucional de México, minando los contrapesos y dirigiendo el estado hacia un presidencialismo”, dijo la firma.\nEn el análisis “ Elecciones 2024 , resultados e implicaciones ”, la firma financiera resaltó que este anuncio de la bancada de Morena genera incertidumbre adicional en el panorama y aversión al riesgo, tal y como se vio en la paridad peso dólar , llevando a la divisa estadounidense a 18 pesos por unidad.\nLee también: López Obrador y Sheinbaum analizarán reformas\n“De aprobarse podríamos ver un incremento significativo en las primas de riesgo, y podría traducirse en que los inversionistas exijan un mayor rendimiento para las inversiones productivas del país, debilitando con ello el atractivo de nuestro país ”, resaltó.\nDe cara a la nueva administración encabezada por Claudia Sheinbaum, Intercam Casa de Bolsa resaltó que el panorama luce complejo para la virtual presidenta electa, además de que se deberá estar atento en los siguientes días a lo que se discutirá en el siguiente periodo ordinario.\n“Debemos esperar a los detalles para tener mayor claridad en el panorama y las implicaciones para la economía. Adicionalmente, no descartamos que la próxima administración reciba un país con mayores complejidades que las actuales, sobre todo por la falta de certidumbre en torno a las finanzas públicas , los altos vencimientos de Pemex en los próximos años, así como una desaceleración de la economía”, destacó.\nDólar toca los 18 pesos por temor a posible aprobación de reformas constitucionales de AMLO\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\nrtd/mg",
