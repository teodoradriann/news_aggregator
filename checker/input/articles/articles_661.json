    "title": "Deion Sanders remains admired by Jerry Jones and the Cowboys amid speculation over coaching change | Marca",
    "text": "E ven at 56 years old, to hear Deion Sanders tell it, the future is so bright that he needs to wear shades.\nThe head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes has retained undying confidence in his team as his second season at the helm began with a win -- albeit unconvincing -- over the North Dakota State Bison . Coach Prime 's swagger -- not to mention his ability to entice recruits out of the transfer portal -- has only grown since he moved to Boulder , even though the Buffs have mustered only a 5-8 record since the start of last season. The stock remains high, and at least one of Sanders ' former teams in the NFL has been paying attention.\nCould Sanders replace Mike McCarthy in 2025? In a recent interview, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones spoke about Sanders and reiterated his admiration for someone he shelled out more than $30 million to sign at the height of playing career in the 1990s.\n\"First of all, you are familiar with our ... ' love affair ' that we have. I have always admired him, both on and off the field,\" Jones told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith . \"Some of the best stories that I have to tell about my time in sports have been Deion-type stories with Deion and Michael (Irvin) and those guys .\"\nJones and Sanders have a strong relationship and a close bond that goes back decades. Monday will mark the 29-year anniversary of Sanders' decision to sign with the Cowboys on a seven-year, $35 million deal complete with a $12.999 million signing bonus . Over his five seasons in Dallas , Prime Time reasserted himself as one of the top cornerbacks of his era, winning a Super Bowl in 1995 and meriting three first-team All-Pro selections before joining the Washington Commanders in 2000.\nIt remains to be seen whether Jones' longstanding admiration for Sanders becomes something more concrete -- such as an offer to coach the Cowboys once Mike McCarthy 's contract expires following the 2024 season. Dallas is not expected to extend McCarthy's contract in 2025 , especially if he can't guide the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl win since... 1995 , Sanders' first year in Dallas' defensive backfield.\nHowever, Coach Prime has been clear that he wants to build a legacy in Colorado -- even after star players Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders depart for the NFL in 2025 . While the admiration from the pro ranks may remain, Deion is the only one who can decide where his coaching future lies after 2024.",

    "text": "The NWS hit back after the governor said the organization did not adequately predict the flooding brought by last week's winter stormThe state is continuing its recovery effort in the aftermath of last Monday's severe storm\nMaine’s Democrat Governor Janet Mills has been branded a liar by the National Weather Service after claiming its forecasters didn’t warn her about a historic storm.\nThe esteemed federal agency lashed Mills after she was slammed for failing to adequately warn locals that up to half a foot of rain would fall on December 18, causing huge floods and leaving 400,000 without power.\nMills put her foot in it last Wednesday while touring flood-battered Kennebec County, saying: ‘The National Weather Service did not predict five or six inches of rain in any community in Maine.’\nBut a NWS spokesman said the 75 year-old lawmaker was talking nonsense, insisting state and local officials had been briefed about the impending inundation on December 15.\nAnd on Sunday the 17th – the day before the storm – the weather service met with state officials to further brief them on expected flooding, winds, and impact to the state’s coast line.\nGovernor Mills deflected blame for Maine’s lack of preparedness for the recent storm to the National Weather Service. pic.twitter.com/egh14zozHl\n— The Maine Wire (@TheMaineWire) December 20, 2023\nGovernor Janet Mills is catching flack for saying the National Weather Service did not adequately predict the severe dimensions of the winter storm that hit Maine last week\nCars are flooded in a parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center alongside the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Waterville, Maine\nMills and her office have not yet responded to the NWS’s claims that she is a liar.\nImages of the storm’s aftermath show cars hanging off extremely damaged roads, intense, murky floodwaters that swept other vehicles away, collapsed construction sites, and downed trees and powerlines.\nThe storm, which Mills called ‘an extraordinary event,’ barreled into the Northeast on Monday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people, forcing flight cancellations, and killing at least four people.\nWind gusts reaches nearly 70 miles per hour, which Mills also said the National Weather Service did not predict.\n‘The National Weather Service did not predict 68-70 mile an hour winds in any area of Maine,’ she said. ‘It was an extraordinary event.’\nIn fact, the NWS does seem to have predicted possible winds of 65-70 miles per hour at the same time that they predicted four-to-six inches of rain.\nEarlier this week, Mills announced the launch of an online resource for Maine residents who were hit hard by the flood and other storm damage.\nThe Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub was launched on Tuesday. According to the governor’s office, it will aggregate ‘information, resources, and assistance’ for those impacted by the storm.\nPropane tanks set free by flood waters discharge gas as they float on the Kennebec River through Augusta, Maine, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023\nNathan Sennett and Tori Grasse retrieve furniture from a flooded patio near the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Hallowell, Maine\nA car floats in a flooded parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center alongside the Kennebec River in Waterville, Maine\nA man observes the flooded Kennebec River on December 19 in Maine\nThe announcement of the hub arrived after civil states of emergency were declared in 14 of 16 counties in Maine.\nThe severity of the storm’s damage prompted Mills to request a Major Disaster Declaration from President Joe Biden, which will allow federal resources to supplement the recovery efforts led by the state.\n‘In the wake of last week’s storm, my Administration has launched the Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub to help Maine people with questions they may have about property damage, road safety, tree removal, and more,’ Mills said in the news release about the resource hub.\n‘We will update this website as more information becomes available as part of our effort to do all we can to support the swiftest possible recovery of Maine communities.’\nThe governor also announced Tuesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved the Maine Emergency Management Agency’s request to begin an preliminary damage assessment, which is the first formal step toward request the aforementioned Major Disaster Declaration.",

    "text": "In a joint statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), United States officials have disclosed the details of a broad cyber espionage campaign by Chinese state-sponsored actors targeting U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.\nThe China-backed hackers, identified as the Salt Typhoon group, have reportedly accessed customer call data, law enforcement records, and private communications of U.S. officials and politically active individuals through prolonged breaches in multiple telecom companies.\nAccording to the FBI and CISA, Salt Typhoon infiltrated major U.S. broadband providers, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies. The breach granted these hackers access to sensitive communications and call records, focusing mainly on government officials and politically involved individuals. \"We have identified that PRC-affiliated actors have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies to enable the theft of customer call records data,\" CISA and the FBI explained in the joint release.\nThe compromised data also included information acquired by U.S. law enforcement under court orders, which the hackers potentially used to gain insight into U.S. counterintelligence targets. The agencies added that \"PRC-affiliated actors… [stole] certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders.\" These activities underscore China's ongoing efforts to access and manipulate U.S. government and private-sector communications systems.\nAccording to officials, Salt Typhoon maintained access for \"months or longer,\" allowing the group to monitor extensive network traffic and intercept private communications at scale. The espionage campaign comes amid growing concerns over Chinese cyber activities targeting critical infrastructure globally. U.S. officials believe that Salt Typhoon's main objectives are to gather intelligence on government-related communications and to track PRC surveillance efforts within the U.S.\nThe same group has also reportedly launched related attacks on Canadian federal institutions. Canadian authorities revealed that China-backed hackers conducted network scans across Canadian government departments, political parties, and critical infrastructure, illustrating the campaign's broad geopolitical scope.\nThe FBI and CISA are working with telecommunications providers to bolster cyber defenses and protect the sector from further breaches. A CISA spokesperson urged affected organizations to report suspected incidents and contact CISA or local FBI offices for assistance. Both agencies coordinate efforts under the recently established Cyber Unified Coordination Group (Cyber UCG) to share insights and strengthen U.S. defenses.\nThis recent disclosure underscores the continuing cybersecurity threat China poses to U.S. critical infrastructure. Salt Typhoon joins a series of PRC-linked groups, including Volt Typhoon and Flax Typhoon, that have targeted the U.S. with cyber campaigns. As the FBI and CISA continue their investigation, further details are expected.

    "text": "Barça - Baskonia: Victoria de coraje (89-85) - Viber - Messenger - Copiar enlace El Barça de baloncesto ha vuelto a ganar en el Palau Blaugrana, en la Euroliga, 48 horas después de llevarse el Clásico ante el Madrid. Esta vez, frente al Baskonia, en un partido emocionante e igualadísimo que no se ha decidido hasta el tramo final. Y que, además, ha necesitado de coraje, entrega y mucho trabajo, porque los culés han tenido que remontar hasta 11 puntos, todos ellos en el último cuarto. El liderazgo de Vesely, con 23 puntos, y unos buenos minutos de Parker y Parra en el tramo final han sido determinantes. Igualdad sobre el parquet del Palau Aunque el marcador se ha destapado con un triple inicial de Costello, el Barça es quien ha empezado mejor el partido. Intensos en defensa e inspirados en ataque, los azulgrana han clavado un parcial de 11-2 al Baskonia que les ha permitido tomar una ventaja de seis puntos (11-5, min 4). Pero ha sido un partido de alternativas y los vascos han reaccionado hasta el punto de que a cuatro minutos del final del primer cuarto, un nuevo triple de Costello les ha situado por delante en el marcador (14-16). El liderazgo del Baskonia ha durado poco porque en la siguiente jugada Jabari Parker ha anotado desde más allá de los 6,75 metros (17-16, minuto 6). La igualdad se ha mantenido hasta el final de los primeros diez minutos (24-23), pero ha sido en el segundo cuarto cuando el Barça se ha intentado escapar en el marcador. El equipo de Roger Grimau ha dominado el período con un Willy Hernangómez imparable en la pintura. El pívot azulgrana ha anotado la canasta que ha dado la máxima ventaja al equipo (nueve puntos de diferencia; 34-25, minuto 14) y ha llegado a sus 14 puntos a falta de tres minutos para el descanso. A pesar de estos minutos de superioridad local, sin embargo, el Baskonia no se ha ido del partido. Sedekerskis, Moneke y Howard han mantenido al conjunto de Dusko Ivanovic siempre cerca y el segundo cuarto ha terminado con una potente penetración, con mate incluido, de Miller-McIntyre que ha vuelto a comprimir el marcador (47-42, minuto 20). El Baskonia despega... Así pues, después del descanso el guión ha cambiado. Si hasta ahora había sido el Barça el que había logrado ir por delante en el electrónico, mientras que el Baskonia seguía la estela del conjunto culé, los papeles se han intercambiado. Howard ha empatado el duelo, mientras que un mate de Miller-McIntyre ha puesto al equipo de Ivanovic por delante (51-53), con un Barça que, sin embargo, no ha dejado que el rival se escapara (62- 68, min 30). Es cierto que un buen parcial visitante en el inicio del último cuarto ha hecho despegar al Baskonia, que ha podido poner el +11 (62-73, min 33), pero la respuesta del Barça ha sido contundente. ... pero la reacción del Barça es decisiva Y es que, de la mano de Jabari Parker, con dos triples y una recuperación, y de Joel Parra, con un triple y un 2+1, se han podido secar las diferencias (76-77, min 35). Sin embargo, sin duda, la clave también ha sido la aparición de Vesely, en unos minutos en los que su dominio ha sido muy difícil de parar para el Baskonia. El checo, junto con la mejora en defensa y la alta presión, ha acabado de dar la vuelta al marcador (84-82, min 38). Los últimos lanzamientos de los vascos no han entrado y dos tiros libres de Vesely han acabado siendo decisivos (86-82, min 39) a 22 segundos para el final. Porque, pese a un triple de Howard, el Barça ya no ha perdido la ventaja y ha podido llevarse el triunfo del Palau (89-85) para cerrar unos días intensos, pero en los que la moneda ha salido cara.
