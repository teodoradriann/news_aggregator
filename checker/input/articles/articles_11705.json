    "title": "New Year's Eve travel disruption: Brits warned there will be train chaos at the weekend as wind and rain hurtles towards the country after Storm Gerrit sparked days of plane, rail and road chaos | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Parts of Britain will endure 75mph wind gusts on New Year's Eve while other areas face heavy rain and snow as 2023 ends with a washout weekend, forecasters say. The Met Office issued a wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. An active cold front will move east across England and Wales tomorrow and into Sunday which will widely bring gusts of 45 to 50mph, but some reaching 60mph and the strongest near coasts in the west and south with 65 to 75mph in places. Meteorologists expect flooding, power cuts and disruption to roads, trains, planes and ferries as well as delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. Up to 50mm (2in) of rain could fall in North West Wales with 25mm (1in) quite widely elsewhere in the country, while Northern Ireland was told to brace for up to 25mm (1in) in a few hours with warnings that the downpours will fall on saturated ground. Separately, a warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight, with up to 10cm (4in) of the white stuff across higher ground and 3cm (1.2in) even on lower ground as well as 25mm (1in) of rain. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm - Storm Henk - after Storm Gerrit sparked days of travel chaos following Christmas . Rail operators told revellers to travel to parties today amid concerns over further disruption and staff shortages when severe weather strikes in the next two days - with one operator issuing a 'do not travel' alert for some routes on New Year's Eve. The Met Office has issued a yellow wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. A warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight Storm Gerrit hammering the seafront at Porthcawl on the South Wales coast this morning Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm A Knottingley Canoe Club member makes their way down the River Ouse in flooded York today People under umbrellas as they go for a punt on the River Cam in the Cambridge rain today Travel continued to be affected by the storm today, with rail disruption in Wales and Scotland - while LNER cancelled some trains this morning due to staff shortages and other services faced speed restrictions due to a signalling fault north of Newcastle. CrossCountry was operating a reduced service due to a 'shortage of train crew'. Avanti West Coast passengers also faced further cancellations today after all London Euston trains were axed yesterday afternoon amid four separate incidents including a person being hit by a train, a points failure, a tree falling on the line and flooding. Other disruption today included on London Underground 's Central and Circle lines due to train shortages and cancellations; Merseyrail due to a signalling fault; and on East Midlands Railway due to a broken down train at Grimsby. Southeastern was also delayed between Ebbsfleet and St Pancras due to a signalling issue. It comes as: Northern, which runs 2,500 services through 500 stations daily, said customers with tickets for New Year's Eve could use them today or tomorrow to avoid disruption. The UK's second largest train operator issued a 'do not travel' warning for six routes with no service on New Year's Eve - including Morecambe or Heysham to Lancaster; Preston to Colne; Manchester Victoria to Chester; Manchester Piccadilly to Chester via Altrincham; Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge; and Clitheroe to Bolton.

Avanti West Coast : Cancellations today after major disruption yesterday following four separate incidents LNER : Some cancellations across the network due to staff shortages. Other services face speed restrictions due to signalling fault north of Newcastle Merseyrail : Signalling fault between Hamilton Square and James Street CrossCountry : Reduced service due to a 'shortage of train crew' East Midlands Railway : Broken down train causing delays between Cleethorpes and Barton-on-Humber ScotRail : All lines now reopen apart from Dumfries to Kilmarnock, but other lines still face speed restrictions and cancellations with buses in place Transport for Wales : Train services remain impacted until Monday due to severe weather including the Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog and Swansea to Shrewsbury lines Southeastern : Delays between Ebbsfleet International and London St Pancras due to a signalling issue London Underground : Delays on Central and Circle lines due to train shortages and cancellations Fellow operator CrossCountry, which calls at 120 stations over its 1,500-mile network and has faced recent staff shortages, said New Year's Eve trains would be 'extremely busy', also warning of 'last-minute cancellations' and an earlier finish than usual. And Chiltern Railways told of a 'high risk of short notice cancellations and disruption' on all routes this weekend 'due to a shortage of train crew'. Engineering works at Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire on New Year's Eve will compound the misery. ScotRail warned services will 'begin to wind down' from 7pm on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile engineering works continued to affect Greater Anglia trains through Chelmsford and London Victoria station has no Southeastern services until New Year's Day. But Andy Street, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, criticised 'self-inflicted' cancellations from crew shortages and urged rail firms to provide more clarity. He told the Daily Telegraph : 'Come clean now, that's what people need. I would prefer to know well in advance what is happening so it can be communicated to passenger and they can make their plans. 'The worst possible thing is a last-minute change, particularly late trains being cancelled.' Mr Street said he understood it would be 'tricky' for operators who are replying on voluntary working, but added: 'My insistence is that we know early what is happening.' Northern chief executive Tricia Williams said: 'Unfortunately, customers travelling over the new year period should expect disruption. 'This is due to limited train crew availability in some areas and planned engineering works. We strongly advise customers to 'check before you travel' on these days.' The Environment Agency issued 128 flood alerts (in amber) and 34 warnings (in red) today ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling due to speed restrictions and some replacement buses. It confirmed this morning that the only line that had not yet reopened was Dumfries to Kilmarnock, where Network Rail engineers needed to check the area following further bad weather. Transport for Wales said the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday – including the Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog line. The Swansea to Shrewsbury line was also closed. LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway were among the other operators urging customers to check before they travel today. As for the forecast, meteorologist Alex Burkill said tomorrow is going to turn 'wet and windy' across the UK with a band of 'intense rain' pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly 'severe gales' in exposed spots. He added northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see 'significant snow', with possibly 10cm (4in) or even 20cm (8in) of snow building up on the highest grounds. 'There's a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we've seen over some recent days,' he said. Blustery and showery conditions are set to continue into New Year's Eve, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK. The mercury is also expected to drop. text text Mr Burkill said: 'As we look towards the end of the day on New Year's Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight. Here is the forecast from today until New Year's Day from Meteogroup UK: Today : Showers are expected today across the UK, but these are set to remain quite scattered and also light in nature. There is the chance of sleet too in North England and North Wales. There will be patchy clouds and sunny spells across South England. Mostly fresh westerly winds, heavier in the North. Tonight : Tonight will begin dry yet cloudy for most of the UK, except North England, where there may be occasional showers or even sleet. The winds will be light and variable, feeling slightly stronger in parts of Scotland and North England. Rain is expected from the early hours of tomorrow morning. Tomorrow : Unsettled weather is forecast for tomorrow, with heavy rain and widespread cloud across much of the UK. Strong coastal winds can be expected, particularly in North England and South England. Feeling very overcast, with little to no clear breaks. Snow is also expected across most of Scotland. Sunday (New Year's Eve): Light showers throughout the day on Sunday, with plenty of cloud and grey skies. There is a chance of these showers turning wintry in parts of North England and Scotland. Becoming mostly dry by evening. Monday (New Year's Day): Monday will start mostly dry, with some snow in Scotland. Heavy rain over South England by evening. 'So perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn't been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it's going to feel close to freezing for many places. 'So definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.' New Year's Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the 'central slice' of the UK most likely to have showery rain. 'As we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it'd be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled - some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,' Mr Burkill said. Earlier, the Met Office said an area of low pressure pushing in from the west tomorrow will be the 'most dominant feature' in the forecast leading up to the New Year. While the severe conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased, today will continue to be blustery with showers and central locations were likely to see the brightest conditions. During the early hours of tomorrow morning, a 'potentially deep area of low pressure' will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK. As this system moves eastwards, forecasters said the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. The Met Office added that it was 'possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland'. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale added: 'This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. 'Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.' Chaotic scenes at London Euston once again yesterday as passengers wait for travel updates Rail passengers queue to get inside Glasgow Central yesterday for a London-bound train Passengers wait at a barrier at London Paddington yesterday while all services are suspended Damaged houses in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, yesterday after Wednesday's tornado Residents in the Kinloss Park area of Cupar in Scotland clean up yesterday after flooding Flooded fields on the Somerset Levels yesterday after Storm Gerrit brought severe weather Looking further ahead into 2024, Met Office deputy chief forecaster Nick Silkstone said: 'Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.' It comes as electricity bosses said they 'very confident' that the remaining 750 properties in Scotland without power after Storm Gerrit will be reconnected today. Graeme Keddie, the director of corporate affairs at SSEN, said 'hard work' by its staff has reconnected more than 45,000 properties who had lost power as a result of the latest storm to hit the UK. High winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country, but Mr Keddie said that by this morning there were 750 homes remaining without electricity, describing that as a 'much improved picture'. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, he told how SSEN staff had 'made a tremendous effort in restoring power to customers affected by Storm Gerrit, battling some very tough weather conditions'. He said: 'We have now restored power to over 45,000 homes and there are now 750 homes still to be connected. 'And we're confident through the resource levels we have we can reconnect these customers throughout today.' He thanked those affected for their 'ongoing patience' as the power firm makes its 'final push' to restore electricity. Storm Gerrit resulted in a 'lot of localised faults' to the power network, Mr Geddie said, adding there were a 'lot of points of multiple damage'. This he said was 'down to the ferocity of Storm Gerrit', adding that wind speeds had been up to 10mph higher than had been forecast in some areas. He insisted SSEN had been 'well prepared' for this latest blast of wintry weather, but added that 'we saw some wind speeds five to 10 miles per hour higher than predicted'. Winds at Inverbervie, on the Aberdeenshire cost, reached 86mph during Storm Gerrit, he said - adding this was higher than the 78mph winds that hit the town during Storm Arwen in November 2021. The latest storm was 'more ferocious than forecast', Mr Geddie stated. But he stressed: 'We're very confident of getting all homes reconnected through the course of today. 'We're got enough people and resource and we are absolutely committed in this final push.' It comes after three men died after their 4x4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, yesterday, North Yorkshire Police said. A 'supercell thunderstorm' moved across the North West of England yesterday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged around 100 homes in Stalybridge in Greater Manchester on Wednesday night. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a 'localised tornado' in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, said that some of her neighbours' houses 'are an absolute disaster' with missing roofs and 'squished' cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to the storm yesterday with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.",

    "text": "Archivo - Varias personas llegando a una oficina de empleo Eduardo Parra - Europa Press - Archivo Aumentan un 92,6% los hombres con jornada parcial para cuidar dependientes, aunque las mujeres siguen siendo mayoría\nMADRID, 27 (EUROPA PRESS)\nSólo un 1,9% de asalariados fueron contratados en 2024 gracias a la intermediación de las oficinas públicas de empleo, porcentaje que se ha mantenido respecto a 2023 y que no varía mucho, décima arriba o abajo, desde hace años.\nSegún datos de la Encuesta de Población Activa (EPA) publicados este jueves por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), 354.500 asalariados obtuvieron el año pasado un puesto de trabajo gracias a la intermediación de una oficina pública de empleo.\nEste dato contrasta con el registrado por las empresas de trabajo temporal (ETT), cuya tasa de intermediación duplica la de las oficinas públicas de empleo.\nEn concreto, el número de asalariados que fue contratado a través de una ETT en 2024 alcanzó la cifra de 734.200, lo que supone una tasa de intermediación del 4%, tres décimas inferior a la de 2023.\nESPAÑA, UN PAÍS DE JEFES PERO SIN SUBORDINADOS\nDe la EPA de 2024 también se extrae que la mayor parte de los trabajadores españoles tiene jefe, pero ningún subordinado. En concreto, siete de cada diez trabajadores se encontraban en esta situación en 2024.\nDel total de ocupados contabilizados el año pasado, el 9,3% no tenía jefes ni subordinados (trabajador independiente), el 6,6% era encargado, capataz o similar; el 6,4% era mando intermedio; el 6,3% era director de una empresa pequeña, departamento o sucursal, y el 0,6% ocupaba el puesto de director de empresa grande o media.\nEl porcentaje de empleados, es decir, de trabajadores con jefe y sin subordinados, aumentó en 2024 seis décimas respecto a 2023, situándose en el 70,5%, mientras que el porcentaje de mandos intermedios se redujo medio punto; el de encargados se mantuvo sin cambios, y el de directores de pequeñas empresas o sucursales bajó tres décimas.\nPor su parte, la proporción de trabajadores independientes (sin jefes ni subordinados) escaló tres décimas en 2024, hasta el 9,3%, en tanto que los directores de empresas grandes o medianas disminuyó una décima.\nLos porcentajes de hombres superan a los de las mujeres en todos los tipos de puesto de trabajo, salvo en el caso del puesto de empleado (con jefes y sin subordinados), donde las mujeres sobrepasan a los hombres en diez puntos.\nLas mayores diferencias entre ambos sexos se dan en ocupados independientes, donde los hombres superan en 3,1 puntos la proporción de mujeres, y en directores de pequeñas empresas, con una brecha de 3,3 puntos.\nEn 2024, el número de ocupados aumentó en una media de 471.700 personas, hasta situarse en 21.653.900 personas. Los más beneficiados por este avance de la ocupación fueron los establecimientos de 250 y más trabajadores, con 237.100 personas más, y los de 10 a 49 trabajadores, con 265.000 más.\nJORNADA PARCIAL POR DEPENDIENTES: SE DISPARAN LOS HOMBRES CUIDADORES\nA lo largo de 2024, un total 417.400 ocupados trabajaron a tiempo parcial para disponer de más tiempo para cuidar a personas dependientes, un 6,7% más que en 2023.\nLa mayoría de los empleados que optaron por la jornada parcial para ejercer las tareas de cuidado fueron mujeres, 381.700, un 2,4% más que en 2023. En el caso de los hombres, un total de 35.700 se acogieron a la jornada parcial para poder ejercer también de cuidadores, un 92,6% más que en 2023.\nCASI UN TERCIO DE LOS OCUPADOS TRABAJA AL MENOS UN SÁBADO AL MES\nLos datos de esta submuestra publicada hoy por el INE también ofrecen cifras sobre el estado del teletrabajo en España.\nSegún Estadística, el porcentaje de ocupados que trabajó más de la mitad de los días desde su domicilio pasó del 7,1% en 2023 al 7,8% en 2024 y la proporción de ocupados que no trabajó ningún día desde casa bajó desde el 84,8% al 83,6%. Por su parte, el 7,6% de los empleados teletrabajó de manera ocasional en 2023, frente al 7% de 2023.\nSobre el trabajo en fines de semana, la estadística muestra que el 32,8% de los ocupados trabajó al menos un sábado al mes, seis décimas menos que en 2023, y el 21% de los ocupados tuvo que hacerlo al menos un domingo al mes, frente al 21,1% de 2023.\nAdemás, el porcentaje de ocupados con jornada nocturna disminuyó desde el 11,9% al 11,4%. Para el 6,6% de los trabajadores este tipo de jornada fue ocasional, mientras que un 4,8% tuvo jornada nocturna más de la mitad de los días trabajados. El porcentaje de trabajadores nocturnos hombres, con un 13,7%, superó al de mujeres (8,8%).",
