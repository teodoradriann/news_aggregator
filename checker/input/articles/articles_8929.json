    "text": "Minnesota Now: Best of 2023 For our last show of the year we want to bring you some of our favorite stories, and some of the top stories of 2023. Minnesota Now always brings you the latest headlines and thoughtful conversation with Minnesotans across the state. Each member of the Minnesota Now team picked a top headline or favorite story. Twin Cities Marathon cancellation One of the top stories of 2023 was the cancellation of the [Twin Cities Marathon]. It was Oct. 1, we had record breaking heat. It’s only the second time it’s ever been canceled in it’s four decades. The decision was a talker, whether or not you were a runner. Covering it on the show is an example of what we do on Minnesota Now, it was a story across many angles: community, fitness and global warming. Grow the Future of Public Media MPR News is supported by Members. Gifts from individuals power everything you find here. Make a gift of any amount today to become a Member! Marijuana legalization Another top headline of 2023 was undoubtably the [legalization of marijuana]. From the first day of legalization on Aug. 1, and since then, the only place able to legally sell cannabis is tribal reservations. We took a look back to the first days of legalization, where there was a rush of people at the White Earth Nation waiting to get their hands on weed. End-of-life bill An end-of-life bill that didn’t get a hearing in the 2023 legislative session will be re-introduced during the 2024 session. It’s a bill that would allow people of sound mind, with a terminal illness, to choose the time of their death with a physician-prescribed dose of lethal medication. In June, we had a conversation with an end-of-life doula. It was one of our [most read stories] online this year, and it was a thoughtful conversation about her mother’s death. Cheryl Hauser, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2019, decided to end her life, on her terms, before the worst of the disease took effect. To do that, she planned to stop eating and drinking. It’s a process known as V-SED, which stands for “voluntarily stopping eating and drinking.” Hauser died on June 2 at the age of 76 with her family and caregivers making sure she was comfortable and without pain or anxiety. Unionization in the nonprofit sector Union organizers on the national level have called summer of 2023 “Hot Labor Summer.” Hollywood writers went on strike, actors joined them in July. By fall, the United Auto Workers were on strike nationwide. New unions formed this year too, and not just at private companies. In Minnesota, newly unionized workers include doctors with Allina Health, University of Minnesota graduate students, and climate advocated with MN350 — [all are nonprofits]. ‘Reservation Dogs’ FX’s hit show “Reservation Dogs” aired its final season in 2023. And the show has some [Minnesota connections]. Actor Dallas Goldtooth, and producers and writers Migizi Pensoneau and Bobby Wilson all work on the show. They also all hail from Indigenous communities in Minnesota and happen to be best friends. We take you back to an insightful and comedic conversation on how the three of them are breaking barriers.",

    "text": ".Hamas accetta l'accordo sulla tregua. Il leader del gruppo islamista, Ismail Haniyeh, ha informato il premier del Qatar Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani e il capo dell'intelligence egiziana Abbas Kamel \"dell'approvazione da parte del movimento della loro proposta sull'accordo di cessate il fuoco\". Haniyeh ha chiamato direttamente i due leader al telefono, annuncia un comunicato di Hamas su Telegram. Poche ore prima il gruppo aveva annunciato una sospensione dei i negoziati al Cairo. \"Abbiamo deciso di sospendere i negoziati per un cessate il fuoco dopo essersi consultati con il resto delle fazioni palestinesi\": aveva detto una fonte di Hamas a Skynews Arabia. \"La decisione è di rinviare il ritorno della delegazione negoziale al Cairo in attesa di resoconti sugli sforzi dei mediatori\", riporta Skynews su X. La leadership del movimento avrebbe ricevuto una richiesta da parte egiziana \"di evitare un'escalation militare e di dare la possibilità di contenere la crisi\". E nel frattempo \"migliaia\" di abitanti di Rafah stanno lasciando la parte orientale della città che si trova nel sud della Striscia di Gaza. Lo afferma la Mezzaluna Rossa palestinese, dopo che Israele ha cominciato a bombardare i due quartieri di Rafah di cui prima aveva ordinato l'evacuazione. L'emittente statale egiziana Al Qahera ha mostrato immagini in diretta di violenti raid israeliani sulla parte orientale di Rafah palestinese e di residenti che vengono evacuati dalle truppe israeliane. Il Gabinetto di guerra israeliano ha approvato ieri sera all'unanimità l'operazione a Rafah, di cui l'esercito ha preparato i piani. Lo hanno riferito i media secondo cui, una volta evacuata la popolazione in un'azione definita dall'Idf \"limitata e temporanea\", l'operazione militare dovrebbe cominciare entro pochi giorni. \"Se Hamas accetterà un accordo\" i preparativi per l'attacco a Rafah \"potrebbero essere fermati\", ha detto però, citato da Ynet, un alto funzionario israeliano aggiungendo che tutto \"è reversibile\". Da parte sua, Hamas ha detto che l'operazione di terra a Rafah non sarà un \"picnic\" per le forze israeliane. \"La nostra coraggiosa resistenza, guidata dalle Brigate al Qassam, è pienamente preparata a difendere il nostro popolo\". Il gruppo palestinese ha inoltre \"lanciato un appello alla comunità internazionale ad agire con urgenza per fermare l'incursione di Israele, che minaccia le vite di centinaia di migliaia di civili\". E dagli Usa fonti ufficiali hanno informato che il presidente Joe Biden ha avuto oggi un colloquio telefonico con il premier Benyamin netanyahu, sulla situazione a Gaza. Secondo quanto è stato riferito dai media, la conversazione tra Biden e Netanyahu è durata circa mezzora. Nella telefonata Biden ha ribadito le preoccupazioni degli Stati Uniti circa un'invasione di Rafah e ha detto che raggiungere un cessate il fuoco con Hamas è il modo migliore per proteggere la vita degli ostaggi israeliani detenuti a Gaza. Lo riferiscono fonti del Consiglio di sicurezza nazionale Usa. Il presidente Usa ha inoltre chiesto a Netanyahu di riaprire subito il valico di Kerem Shalom, chiuso ieri dopo l'attacco di Hamas che ha ucciso 4 soldati. Lo ha fatto saper il sito Axios citando una fonte Usa. La Casa Bianca, riferendo il contenuto del colloquio. ha detto che Biden \"ha ribadito la sua chiara posizione su Rafah\", mentre Netanyahu \"ha concordato di garantire che il valico di Kerem Shalom sia aperto per l'assistenza umanitaria a chi ne ha bisogno\". ed è stato aggiornato \"sugli sforzi per garantire un accordo sugli ostaggi, anche attraverso i colloqui in corso oggi a Doha, in Qatar\". Una alta fonte egiziana ha detto che \"la sicurezza sulla linea di confine tra Egitto e Striscia di Gaza è stata rinforzata con forze sufficienti, e il valico di Rafah è sicuro e pronto ad affrontare una invasione di Rafah nelle prossime ore\", sottolineando che \"l'Egitto è pienamente preparato all'eventuale invasione\". Una fonte ufficiale nel Governatorato del Nord Sinai ha rivelato che c'è la disponibilità ad accogliere un certo numero di palestinesi in caso di sfollamento forzato verso l'Egitto e ad insediarli temporaneamente in qualsiasi area disponibile nei pressi del confine. Intanto alcuni camion di aiuti in viaggio verso la Striscia sono tornati indietro sul lato egiziano. Gallant, 'Hamas non ha lasciato altra scelta' Hamas non ha lasciato \"altra scelta che cominciare l'operazione\" a Rafah. Lo ha detto - secondo il suo ufficio, citato dai media - il ministro della Difesa israeliano Yoav Gallant al suo omologo Usa Lloyd Austin. Nella conversazione Gallant ha aggiunto che \"Israele sta facendo di tutto per arrivare ad una bozza per il rilascio degli ostaggi e un cessate il fuoco temporaneo\", ma \"in questa fase Hamas rifiuta qualsiasi proposta che lo consenta\". 'Un'operazione temporanea' Un'operazione \"temporanea\" e di \"portata limitata\". Così l'esercito israeliano ha descritto l'avvio dell'operazione di spostamento dei civili dalla parte est di Rafah nel sud della Striscia. \"Abbiamo avviato un'operazione su scala limitata per l'evacuazione temporanea delle persone che - ha detto un portavoce militare - vivono a Rafah est\". Secondo alcuni dati nell'area della città ci sono attualmente centinaia di migliaia di sfollati palestinesi. L'evacuazione da Rafah est riguarda 100.000 persone L'esercito israeliano ha annunciato che sta evacuando circa 100.000 persone dalla parte orientale di Rafah, in vista di un previsto assalto di terra nella città meridionale della Striscia di Gaza. \"La stima è di circa 100.000 persone\", ha detto ai giornalisti un portavoce militare rispondendo a chi gli chiedeva quante persone sarebbero state evacuate. Secondo l'Organizzazione mondiale della sanità, circa 1,2 milioni di persone sono attualmente rifugiate a Rafah. Riproduzione riservata © Copyright ANSA",
