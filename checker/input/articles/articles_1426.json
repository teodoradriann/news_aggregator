    "text": "Gold from Waste - What Revolutionary Discovery Scientists Made.\ntoday, 06:20\n68\nJournalist\nShostal Oleksandr\ntoday, 06:20\n68\nScientists have developed a new method for extracting gold from electronic waste that is efficient and safe. They used proteins that form amyloid fibrils when heated, which help separate gold from other metals.\nResearch and Gold Extraction Process\nProtein fibrils are converted into aerogel, which is used for gold extraction. Experiments have shown that this method can yield almost 91% pure gold with a content of nearly 22 carats.\nScientists believe that this new method could be an important step towards the ecological recycling of electronic waste and reducing the negative impact on the environment.\nThe presented text describes a new method for extracting gold from electronic waste that is more efficient and safer than previous methods. This method could contribute to more eco-friendly recycling of electronic waste and a reduction in harmful effects on the environment.Read also",

    "title": "New Pokémon Stadium-Like Mobile Game Announced at Pokémon Presents",
    "text": "A new Pokémon battle-centered game called Pokémon Champions is coming to Nintendo Switch and mobile devices. Announced during the Pokémon Presents presentation, the game will focus on player-versus-player battles. From what can be seen in the trailer, it will allow for 2v2 battles and will also feature cross-play between smartphones and consoles.\nBattles will feature all the traditional elements of the battle system from the mainline Pokémon games. That means species, abilities, moves, and more will be in play. On the other hand, it was revealed that this new game will be able to connect to Pokémon Home to use creatures from other related games.\nRelated\nFans Are Grieving For the Unreleased Pokémon N64 RPG That Never Was\nA Pokémon RPG from the '90s has been revealed.\nA New Battle-Focused Pokémon Spin-Off\nDuring the Pokémon Presents presentation, Pokémon Champions was officially revealed, a new Pokémon battle-focused spin-off for Nintendo Switch and smartphones. This game will feature all the core battle mechanics of Pokémon games, such as type advantages and automatic abilities. Another special detail, as seen in the trailer, is that special moves from different generations will be available in one place, such as Mega Evolutions from Pokémon X/Y and Terastal Forms from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.\nThe teaser shows a battle between a Dondozo and an Aegislash against a Charizard and a Hisuian Samurott. This confirms the possibility of bringing Pokémon from different games through the Pokémon Home connection, as the Aegislash is from Pokémon Sword/Shield, while the Hisuian Samurott is from Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Also emphasized was the possibility of cross-platform battles between consoles and mobile phones, a feature previously seen in the online MOBA Pokémon Unite.\nSimilar to Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Colosseum, battles will take place in a Pokémon Battle Arena. This is the first time in nearly 20 years that a new spin-off focused on Pokémon battles has been announced, the last being Pokémon Battle Revolution for Nintendo Wii in 2006. This particular game allowed the Nintendo DS to be connected to use equipment from Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.\nRelated\nWhy There Needs To Be A Modern Pokémon Stadium Now More Than Ever\nBetween balancing casual and more competitive gameplay and the wealth of features, Pokémon Stadium needs a modern comeback.\nThis announcement has been the start of many discussions, as it presents an option focused on gamers who prefer the battles of the games rather than the exploration and adventure component. Rumors are already circulating that this could signal a change in the Pokémon competitive scene, abandoning the tournaments held in the mainline games and using this new Pokémon Champions as a special main platform for official ranked matches.\nA release date has not yet been announced, and it has only been stated that Pokémon Champions is in development, but it's possible that this title may have connectivity features with games that will be released for the Nintendo Switch 2. One such game could be Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is said to be available for both the new console and the original Nintendo Switch. Several new features were also recently revealed for this game.\nSource: The Pokémon Company",

Entre os registros publicados para seus mais de 64 milhões de seguidores, um deles mostra a artista ao lado de Sergio Pina, pai de santo do terreiro, e outros membros da comunidade.\nDo Hanse se enfurece após saber de cancelamento de show no Brasil pela web\nPorém, pouco depois da postagem, Anitta revelou ter perdido cerca de 100 mil seguidores em apenas uma hora.\nA cantora não se intimidou e reagiu com ironia: “E lá se vão mais 100k seguidores. Toda vez que posto foto no terreiro é isso. Limpa, limpa, limpa.”\nEm seguida, Anitta publicou uma foto de um livro com uma mensagem reflexiva: “A vitória cria o ódio, enquanto o derrotado vive na miséria. Um homem em paz vive feliz, desprezando as ideias de vitória e de derrota.”",
