    "text": "AKRON, Ohio — There was a loud and proud celebration at Copley High School on Thursday. The girls' basketball team was sent off with a lot of fanfare after making it to the state final four for the first time in 20 years. The last time the team made it this far was in 2006 before some of these players were even born. News 5 Anchor Katie Ussin was there for the big send-off and spoke with Copley senior guard Emily Kerekes about the team’s journey this season. “We just worked hard through it all and I feel like now is when it means the most and we’re all going to do it together,” she said. The three seniors on the team, including Kerekes, have been playing together since they were little kids. “I feel like we have a really special bond on our team,\" Senior forward Kami Ayoup. \"We’re able to be on the court, work hard together, push each other, hold each other accountable, and then when we’re off the court, it’s like we’re best friends, I feel like.” Senior guard Izzy Callaway called this moment “meant to be.” It’s that friendship and the trust they’ve built that fuel this team. Coach Julie Solis said they’re all humbled by the chance to make history. “Being there before myself in other situations, I think the secret is always about the chemistry,” she said. Her message to the team is to “embrace the moment.” The team's parents are embracing the moment as well. The moms of those three seniors said they’ve also been together for years. “We’ve been on the sidelines making sandwiches and lunches and going to every game, and it’s just amazing,” Kim Kerekes said. Kami’s mom, Kris Ayoup, called this moment bittersweet. “There’s going to be tears, there’s going to be smiles, laughs, hugs. I mean, all the emotions for sure.” “I’m so proud of you girls,” said Izzy’s mom, Angie Callaway. “Let’s do this and enjoy every moment. The players, coaches, and parents all said they were blown away by the support they’ve gotten from the community. Copley-Fairlawn City schools canceled classes Friday so everyone could cheer the team on when they play at the University of Dayton. They said at least 500 Copley-Fairlawn fans bought tickets for their section in the arena. Given the team’s outstanding season and the memories they’ve made together that’ll last a lifetime, no matter the outcome in Dayton, these young women have already won.

    "title": "Rural property sales decline as the big spring farm sales loom | Farm Online | ACT",
    "text": "Rural property sales have continued to cool heading into traditional spring farm selling campaigns. After a record run with farmland prices over the past few years, landowners will be keen for the trend to continue as their properties join the spring offerings. Elders Real Estate's [latest property analysis](https://elders.com.au/for-farmers/market-insights/rural-property-update/) shows the market has continued to slow during the first part of this year consolidating the strong gains witnessed in recent years. Elders' national rural property indicator fell four per cent during the first quarter although it remains 3pc above the levels of the same time last year. The average annual rate of capital growth over the past decade has been 10pc. Elders general manager (farmland agency and water) Mark Barber said the market has been strengthened by good quality commercial and corporate sized transactions which have sold well to strong inquiry. Activity at the other end of the market has been more subdued with a greater proportion of deals subject to debt funding coming under increased scrutiny by financiers and attracting subdued buyer inquiry, Mr Barber said. The number of properties sold during the first quarter of 2024 was down 9pc compared with last quarter and 17pc below the same period a year ago. It was the lowest number of sales on record. The dry autumn in southern areas saw a fall in farmer confidence. South Australian rural property values fell by 4pc on a large lift in the volume of properties sold during the peak selling season. \"Experience from recent sales conducted by the Elders team in southern areas are that property prices are starting to strengthen as farm incomes improve and on forecasts of a normal or better spring and improved commodity prices,\" Mr Barber said. The Elders property market Indicator for Victoria/Tasmania fell 15pc during the first quarter leaving it 8pc down on the same time last year. This fall came after the boom in farm prices over three years property prices jumped 11.7pc annually. Mr Barber said part of the fall could also be attributed to a slight shift in the types of property on the market in these areas. \"It is not unusual to see some volatility in property markets from time to time,\" he said. The market was stronger in other states - holding firm in NSW with small rises in WA and Queensland. In Queensland, the positive medium-term outlook for cattle prices has aided market sentiment, he said. Mr Barber said high-quality and well-presented properties continue to be in strong demand irrespective of where they are. Elders NSW sales executive Richard Gemmell said seasonal conditions have generally been favourable towards a positive start for feed crops, winter cereals and the potential for strong pasture growth looking out as far as spring. \"Farmland transactions continue throughout the state with values holding, in particular when potential investor and willing sellers are familiar with the current market and willing to strike common ground,\" he said. \"As more acquisitions are being funded through debt, we are being advised investors should prepare early to be purchase ready whenever possible to avoid approval delays. Elders rural sales executive (South Australia) Adam Chilcott said after many years of consistent underlying land growth across all regions \"small corrections to averages\" were observed at the start of the year. \"In a noticeable trend, farm transaction sales were strong in the first three months of the year largely enabling buyers ample time to settle properties and plan winter sowing programs in advance. \"With the warmest March in South Australia ever recorded, buyer participation was cautious and more considered, than in recent times. Elders Qld/NT state real estate manager Tim Lane said: \"The northern rural property has been underpinned by a number of significant good quality commercial and corporate sized transactions which have sold well to strong inquiry. \"Activity at the other end of the market has been more subdued with deals subject to debt funding coming under increased scrutiny by financiers. \"While prices have held, activity is declining as buyer inquiry has softened with days on market increasing.\" Mr Lane said the [upcoming sale](https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/8691042/ray-scotts-107503-hectare-cattle-empire-officially-on-market/) of the Ray Scott Pastoral Group Aggregation of properties would provide a gauge of how much good seasonal conditions and the positive medium-term outlook for cattle has driven market sentiment. Property prices \"took a step backwards\" during the first part of 2024 as seasonal conditions deteriorated and farmer confidence fell. The Victorian/Tasmanian rural property indicator fell 15pc to $14,198/ha wiping out the gains made across 2023. Sales volumes remain at historically low levels with just 220 sales through the first quarter of the year, down 9pc. Elders real estate sales executive (Western Australia) Simon Cheetham said high rainfall property prices through the south-west have held strong and experienced further increases despite volatility in the livestock markets. He said forestry activity was a key driver through these zones. \"Despite a dry season in 2023 for much of the northern wheatbelt, prices have been firm for the most part, with limited supply coming onto the market,\" Mr Cheetham said. \"Exceptionally high rainfall over the past month has set up much of this zone well in 2024. \"Current seasonal conditions for the balance of the state are mixed, with some quality properties to be offered to the market in coming months.

    "title": "Zoë Kravitz Details How She Chose Her Dad Over Her Mom, and It’s a Decision That “Was Very Hurtful” | The Nerd Stash",
    "text": "[Zoë Kravitz](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/zoe-kravitz/) is the daughter of two celebrities; Lisa Bonnet and [Lenny Kravitz](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/lenny-kravitz/). She is close to both of her parents, who have a fantastic co-parenting relationship despite splitting in 1991 when she was just a toddler. Zoë initially lived with her mother in Miami, Florida, while her father became a superstar. She continued to see him, but she did not live with him. But that changed when she was a preteen. Zoë recently reflected on her decision as an 11-year-old in an interview with [Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61792787/zoe-kravitz-blink-twice-interview-2024/). She told the publication how she chose to move from Miami, where she described her life as “really quiet, really simple life,” to live with her father in New York. She described the contrast of their lifestyles, noting how her father’s lifestyle was “this whirlwind of a completely different universe.” But living with her dad was not as idyllic as she initially thought. “Just like it happens in the movies,” she said, “it’s like, ‘Oh, you think this is perfect? You think this is great? Guess what comes with this.’” Zoë Kravitz reflects on how her decision was hurtful to her mother Choosing to leave Lisa Bonnet’s home to live with her rockstar dad is a choice that Zoë Kravitz made that she felt was best for her at the time, but she seemingly has some guilt over it. “I think it was very hurtful that I moved away from her to be with my dad, and my dad wasn’t even there,” she said. That doesn’t mean she regretted moving in with her dad, but at the time, she did not fully understand what her mother was trying to achieve with her quieter lifestyle and strict rules. She continued, “I just wish I had been able to appreciate what she was doing for me. She was so focused on preserving my innocence. My creativity. Because she knew what the world is — that you don’t get that back.” As an adult, Zoë Kravitz remains close with both of her parents, and their co-parenting relationship remains a stunning example of how former couples can create a positive living environment for their children.",

    "text": "[Remove](/premium/subscription)\n\"Any methods necessary?\" Merlin asked, looking at me, waiting for confirmation.\n\"Yes.\" I nodded, looking into his eyes. I just returned from the station, where I watched the train depart with Yuri trudging through the snow in the Princess. \"Do whatever it takes so our prisoner tells us everything he knows about our enemy. I don't care what methods you use; I don't care what remains of him afterward. Learn it all.\"\n\"I will do my best.\" He nodded, saluting, leaving to start on it at once. As for what results he would have, I didn't know, but I hoped to learn something about our adversary. Something that we could use against him…\nHaaah… There was a day when I wasn't worried about Yuri. Hell, I even sent her into an enemy city. But... I couldn't help but be nervous now. I just hoped I wouldn't have to go and try and rescue her again. The quicker this war is over, the better; I can't focus on relaxing and exploring with this shit going on… I just wanted to have fun in my new life.\n…\n….\n……\nFar away from Avalon and Lothlia, in the city of Cerna, Mirian was reading the urgent message from the Frontier. Its messenger was waiting in the castle's dining room, being served because he could barely stand, rushing through the heavy snow from the Black Region, arriving at the city in only a few days.\n\"This isn't good…\" She mumbled, biting her lips.\n\"They are under attack…\" Milan whispered, reading the letter, standing beside her, knowing this assault was the handiwork of the monster ruling from within the capital's palace.\n\"And we can't send the Judgement over to help… I hope he won't take it personally.\"\n\"Not if you explain it.\" Milan whispered, rubbing her shoulders.\nThey couldn't provide any help. Since winter started, the Silver Region has been breached twice, not by an army but by the remaining two flying ships of Ishillia. Of the three they had, one was clearly sent away to assault the Frontier, and the other two continuously harassed Cerna and the region. They never truly come near the city, but they flew close enough for the Judgement to pick up on their presence. They were testing whether it was still there almost every other day, and if they ever found the city lacking, Mirian was sure they would move in and wipe it off the map. She knew that Pascal was using the winter to give up on the defense of his borders, knowing there wouldn't be an attack coming in this weather. He could draw back the ships and use them to keep her in check.\n\"The old bastard aims to keep me here while destroying my allies.\"\n\"I'm surprised he doesn't order the ships to attack us.\"\n\"He won't.\" she answered her husband, sighing while enjoying his massage. \"I left with the Spear in hand… I think he is afraid of it; that is why he will try to isolate us.\"\n\"Good thing that he doesn't know you can't use it!\" He chuckled, making Mirian twitch her mouth.\nIt was true. Since saving her, the Spear remained dormant and returned to be nothing more but a… spear. Its only actual use now was to rally the people under her. The first thing Mirian did was showcase it and announce to the world that the Spear was with her and that her claim to the throne was more legitimate than Pascal's, as the artifact of the Goddess Ariana chose her. It had a significant effect as even some of the nobles ruling the neighboring counties around the Silver Region began to side with her. However, their cooperation was cut short by the heavy snowfall.\n\"I will write an answer.\" Mirian sighed, hoping this wouldn't strain her relationship with Leon. \"I will risk flying over with the Judgment if they reach Avalon… But I won't risk it for Lothlia.\"\n…\n….\n……\nIt was just as cold of a dawn as before. Yet, no conscripts could complain because the grey morning air's chill was shattered by the resounding thud of the first trebuchet launching its payload toward Lothlia. Otto's siege engines had been appropriately prepared and positioned throughout the night for the sole reason that the morning would bring the very first assault against the city. The first stone soared into the dark sky, becoming a large shadow itself, cutting through the freezing air as it hurled toward the city's walls. The soldiers below, mercenaries and conscripts alike, watched in silence, especially the latter part of the army, because they were told to attack the side where an opening presented itself.\nOtto stood in the Imaginary of the Lawbringer, his airship hovering like a general at the edge of the battlefield. His eyes were focused on the first stones, tracing their path as they plummeted toward Lothlia. This would be the first test of the city's defenses—the moment that would reveal what kind of defenses they have. He knew that magical shields would not protect against physical attacks… Could they do anything to stop his boulders, or could he bring the walls down on the first try? He was about to find out.\nThe very first stone to be flung away was already on a downward trajectory, almost sure to strike the thick walls of Lothlia. But just as it neared its target, a bright flash erupted from somewhere within the city, painting the faraway buildings orange. In an instant, a beam of crimson firebolt streaked through the air and struck the stone mid-flight, exploding it with a loud bang. The fragments scattered in all directions, crashing to the ground, kicking up big puffs of snow, or striking the walls, but with their reduced size, they could do no real damage to it.\nOtto's jaw tightened as the same spell fired again, in rapid succession, this time vaporizing a second stone before it even reached halfway to the wall. His mercenaries and engineers, witnessing the unnatural precision of the city's weapons, shifted uneasily, unsure what to do next. For a brief moment, there was a collective silence, a tense hesitation rippling through the ranks as everyone processed what they had just seen.\nBut then the westernmost trebuchets released their stones, letting them soar high into the sky, along with seven others. Although the same thing happened now, there were not enough spells unleashed to stop all of them. Finally, they managed to hit the walls… One of the hefty stones slammed into the western part with a dull, echoing boom, sending a plume of debris into the air. Then, the second followed soon after, crashing into the same weakened section, and the walls of Lothlia shuddered under the impact, caving in.\nA breach had been made. It wasn't what Otto had expected. It was small, but enough to try attacking it.\n\"Send the conscripts!\" He ordered, his voice cold, echoing across the deck of the Lawbringer. \"I want to see what else they're capable of.\"\nBeneath him, his officers relayed the command, and within minutes, the mass of conscripts began their forced march toward the breach. Their commanders did not offer rousing speeches or words of encouragement this time. The initial facade was discarded, and now they were openly corralled toward an inescapable demise with nothing but shouts and threats of being put to death anyway if they refused.\nOtto watched as the line of conscripts from the western side, blue-lipped, shivering warriors, shuffled forward. They moved in groups of fifty, forming into loose battalions that stretched out over the snow-covered plains. In total, over a thousand men were dispatched, enough to test the city's defenses but not enough to risk the bulk of his forces. To Otto, they were expendable—pawns in a larger game. It would be worth the sacrifice if they reached the breach and forced the defenders to reveal more of their tricks.\nThe mercenaries remained at their campfires, sipping their morning ale and watching the conscripts with mild interest. They had no stake in this part of the battle; their time would come when the actual fighting began. They could, for now, afford to sit back and let the cannon fodder soften up the city's defenses. The only shouts were of those who made a bet, curious if they could double their daily pay or not.\nAs the conscripts approached the walls, the magic cannons remained eerily silent. Otto couldn't help but wonder… Was their range this short? But then… how did they shoot down the boulders? Although those spells came from within the city, not from the walls.\n\"Maybe it was one of those monster machines…\" He whispered, clenching his fingers into a fist.\nWhile trying to figure it out, his men trudged closer, their breath clouding in the freezing air, their boots crunching through the snow. Some glanced nervously toward the sky, fearing another volley of magic would rain down upon them. Others muttered prayers, clutching their spears and halberds.\nWhen they were within reach of the breach, the defenders finally made their move.\nA deafening blast echoed across the battlefield as one of the cannons roared to life like an angry dragon. But instead of targeting the conscripts, it aimed at the jagged rubble surrounding the breach. The blast shattered what remained of the fractured wall, sending chunks of stone tumbling down toward the advancing troops. Dozens of conscripts were crushed beneath the falling debris, their cries of pain quickly swallowed by the chaos, buried under stone and snow.\nThe commanders shouted loudly at the back of the conscripts, forcing them to move faster. It was an opportunity. The breach was open, and now was the time to strike. The conscripts surged ahead, desperation pushing them into a clumsy charge toward the exposed section of the wall.\nBut the warriors atop the wall had prepared for this. As the first wave of conscripts scrambled through the rubble, they were met with a hail of arrows from above. Shields were of little use—many of the conscripts lacked them altogether, and those that did found their flimsy wooden barriers, bringing them along; they were splintered by the sheer force of the arrows.\nThe front lines crumbled almost instantly. Bodies were being piled up near the breach as the conscripts faltered under the relentless assault. They stumbled over their fallen friends, their resolve already beginning to break. Some men turned to flee, but the commanders stationed behind them, part of Otto's personal army, brandished their swords and cut down anyone who stopped moving. Anyone who retreated without orders was beheaded with one strike.\nFor a brief moment, the desperate battalion regrouped and pressed forward once more, desperate to escape the deathtrap of the breach. A few managed to climb the rubble and engage the defenders directly, swinging their weapons wildly and blindly. However, they were no match for what waited for them. Avalon's elite, towering over their freezing, weak bodies, swatted their spears away as if they were simple children's toys. Then, their bone-colored weapons flashed, and bodies were split into two without any shout, killing them silently and meticulously. It was a slaughter, more chilling than the weather. Blood stained the snow, and the bodies of the fallen were trampled underfoot as more men were sent forward to meet the same fate, just to be dismembered and thrown back down.\nOtto watched from his vantage point, his expression impassive. This was not going as he had expected. The conscripts were performing their role—dying, but they failed to reveal the enemy's strength. Where were those machines? Why were the cannons he clearly saw on the walls silent? Were they… fake? To frighten him? No… That… that couldn't be, could it? He could only see that Lothlia's soldiers were well-trained, well-equipped, and dangerous. But their numbers were low, and with his army, he would drown them sooner or later in their own blood. The breach had been created, and if he could find a way to neutralize them, shooting the flying boulders down, the city would fall.\nAs he was thinking about it, the conscripts at the breach reached their breaking point. The morale of the surviving men was shattered as they realized there was no way forward. The arrows continued to rain down, and the defenders above showed no signs of weakening. Panic quickly set in, and soon, the remaining conscripts turned and fled in a desperate attempt to escape the slaughter.\nIt was chaos.\nHalf of the men sprinted back toward Otto's camp, their weapons discarded in the snow, fear etched into their faces. With hundreds of them doing it, Otto's officers could not kill them all, even as they rushed after them in fury… But that didn't mean they could escape or they wouldn't be punished. The mercenaries stationed at the rear sneered as they got up, readying their weapons. It was finally time to exercise a little and make an example out of the weaklings.\nWhile those who were running for their lives were heading to their inevitable doom, the other half of the conscripts had no chance to flee. Accepting their fate, they began dropping their weapons, waiting for the sweet release of death. Yet… it didn't come. To their surprise, those who surrendered weren't killed. Seeing that the defenders ignored them, the sound of battle was quickly replaced with weapons being thrown down, yells for mercy, and hundreds of warriors raising their hands, shouting their submission.\nThe conscripts, who remained at the wall, were all rounded up and herded like cattle into the city, where they would face an uncertain fate… but through their surrender, they still carried a small hope of survival.\nOtto had already turned away from the battlefield, his face grimacing in disgust. The first assault had not gone as he had planned. He hadn't seen what he needed to see, and the city's defenses were still filled with unknowns and mysteries.\n\"Prepare the next wave!\" he ordered his officers, his voice cold and calculating. \"I want all our trebuchets to fire at the same time!\"\n[Remove](/premium/subscription)\nSupport \"Steel and Mana\"\n[Log In](/account/login?ReturnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.royalroad.com%2Ffiction%2F95698%2Fsteel-and-mana%2Fchapter%2F1953938%2Fchapter-259-the-siege-of-lothlia-3%3Futm_source%3Dhome%26utm_medium%3Dlatest_updates)",

    "title": "LA Lakers Trade Prediction: LeBron James and Co. poised to bag $84 million duo from Utah Jazz to improve roster before trade deadline, claims NBA analyst - Times of India",
    "text": "<p>Collin Sexton (Image via Getty)<br></p> Collin Sexton and Walker Kessler might make their way in to LeBron James' home. The Los Angeles Lakers , currently on a three-game losing streak, are in desperate need of a roster shake-up as they head toward the February 6 NBA trade deadline. After a strong start to the season, the Lakers find themselves slipping in the Western Conference standings, with a recent loss to the San Antonio Spurs intensifying their struggles. To get back on track, the Lakers are reportedly eyeing a trade with the Utah Jazz to address key issues at point guard and center.\nAccording to NBA Analysis Network's Aikansh Chaudhary, the Los Angeles Lakers are looking to acquire two players who could provide immediate impact: Collin Sexton and Walker Kessler. The trade proposal would send Gabe Vincent, Max Christie, Jalen Hood-Schifino, and a 2031 first-round pick to Utah Jazz in exchange for Sexton and Kessler. This potential move addresses both of the Lakers' major needs: a reliable scorer and a true center.\n\"After going on a small winning streak and climbing the ranks in the Western Conference standings, the LA Lakers once again find themselves in a slump,\" Chaudhary wrote. The Los Angeles Lakers' recent form has exposed their weaknesses, and with LeBron James subtly hinting at roster changes, the team must act quickly to improve its chances for the rest of the season.\nWalker Kessler of Utah Jazz (Image via Getty)\nCollin Sexton, currently averaging 18.2 points per game on a career-best 42.0% shooting from beyond the arc, would bring much-needed scoring depth to the Lakers. As Utah Jazz’s second-leading scorer, he has been consistent despite the team’s poor 10-29 record. \"Sexton would fit perfectly in the starting lineup, and he could be the third or fourth scoring option on the team,\" Chaudhary noted, suggesting the 24-year-old guard could complement LeBron James and Anthony Davis well.\nMeanwhile, Walker Kessler, a 7-foot rising star, offers the Los Angeles Lakers exactly what they need in a center. He’s averaging 10.8 points, 2.5 blocks, and shooting 72% from the field. \"Kessler is a traditional center, just what the Lakers need to give Anthony Davis some breathing room,\" Chaudhary explained. As a defensive force and an efficient scorer, Kessler could take some of the pressure off Davis, allowing the Lakers' star to focus on other aspects of the game.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#6](c6#c-6) Y la deforestación en la región supera el 40% en 20 años ( https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/BRA/21)). Y si mueven la ciudad seguirán deforestando nuevas zonas. En fin, peores pronosticos de precipitaciones extremas y peores decisiones medioambientales de uso de suelo es el coctel perfecto. No sé de qué coño se sorprenden algunos.\n[#40](c40#c-40) [#38](c38#c-38) No sé qué no has entendido de que los asentamientos humanos llevan décadas o siglos en sus emplazamientos, aunque a veces sean peligrosos.\n¿Que sería mejor desplazarlos? Sí. ¿Que es fácil o posible para la población más pobre? No.\nMiles de ciudades llevan siglos construidas cerca de ríos, y no es \"culpa\" de los habitantes de ahora. No podemos culpar a los que han nacido ahí de seguir viviendo ahí.\nY si no se entiende eso, no se está entendiendo nada.\n[#43](c43#c-43) Lo que dices esta muy bien. Pero no soluciona nada. Empatizar con los habitantes esta bien pero no evitara que esa gente se muera cuando se inunde la zona donde viven. La unica solucion es cambiar de sitio o morir. Yo cambiaria de sitio no se tu.\n[#43](c43#c-43) Me parece que el que no lo entiende eres tú. Si un asentamiento lleva siglos cerca de un río es que el cauce no va por ahí. Punto.\nTe lo dice uno en cuyo pueblo hay una iglesia con más de 1000 años, a 200 o 300 m del mismo río que estaba ahí cuando se construyó. Sigue en pie y con los cimientos secos\n[#37](c37#c-37) Precisamente, si analizasen y entendiesen las cosas, sabrían que construir en zonas que el río puede reclamar es bastante peligroso\n[#26](c26#c-26) La humanidad trabaja con estimaciones de riesgo. A veces buenas, a veces malas. Yo, cada día que cojo el coche para ir a trabajar, asumo un riesgo mayor que si no fuese. Me compensa ese riesgo más alto de morir con el sueldo. El que se hace una casa junto al Vesubio, hace lo mismo.\nLa gente no es idiota. Sí podemos ser bastante malos estimando riesgos, sobre todo a largo plazo.\n[#11](c11#c-11) En Alicante, en Finestrat el ayuntamiento llevaba 15 años avisado de que el mercadillo se instalaba todas las semanas en zona peligrosa. Hace un par de años pasó lo que estaba avisado y murieron unos turistas y entonces si que se van a poner a arreglarlo. Por la mala prensa, las multas, el escándalo. Anteriormente no se movió un dedo y lo sabían todos.\nPs: puta memoria, fue hace 12 años\nhttps://alicanteplaza.es/la-cala-de-finestrat-punto-negro-en-riadas-con-tres-muertos\n¿No tienen topógrafos que estudien el terreno y aconsejen sobre si es viable construir o no? Si cada uno hace/construye lo que les sale de las narices donde le parece, luego que no lloren.\nEso me recuerda a una clase de geografía en el instituto. La profesora nos hizo marcar el curso del agua en caso de que hubiera lluvias muy fuertes. Casi toda la clase marcamos la misma trayectoria. Luego resultó ser un mapa de Biescas y la zona donde pasaba el agua era precisamente el camping que se inundó y acabó con la vida de tanta gente. Si unos críos de 17 años pudieron verlo, nos preguntamos cómo no lo vieron las autoridades que se encargaban de dar licencias.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Trabajé hace muchos años en una confederación hidrográfica. Puede que el tema haya cambiado, pero todas las confederaciones, ya entonces, tenían públicos los datos de terrenos inundables en 50 y 100 años. Pero no era un dato vinculante. La comunidad autónoma o el ayuntamiento de turno podían obviarlo olímpicamente.\nYa digo, fue hace unos 20 años y puede que el tema haya cambiado, pero lo dudo.\n[#15](c15#c-15) Las confederaciones hidrográficas están plagadas de \"técnicos\" que nunca en su vida pisaron un río\n[#10](c10#c-10) Aquí los tenemos y se sigue construyendo donde a alguno le sale de los cojones, luego que el río se te lleva la casa como sucedió hace poco en no recuerdo qué pueblo del pirineo.\nLo de las carreteras son 200 millones de dólares, no doscientos mil millones . El ministro dijo mil millones de Reales.\nEl cambio climático trae fenómenos más extremos, pero no inventó las inundaciones y los desbordamientos de los ríos.\nEn Biescas no había habido una riada como la de 1996 desde los años 20 del siglo XX, así que se hizo caso omiso del informe negativo a la instalación del camping. Hay una negligencia ahí que sigue siendo tal ya se produzcan las riadas cada 70 años, o si el cambio climático las hace más frecuentes.\nSe construye donde no se debe, ya sea por una reglamentación deficiente, por pelotazo y corruptelas, o por lo que sea, y luego cuando llegan las consecuencias es muy cómodo responsabilizar por completo a una cosa abstracta como el cambio climático donde se diluye la culpa.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Seguro que la población pobre de esos lugares son los culpables y merecen ser llamados gilipollas\n[#22](c22#c-22) Pues habría que ver si son más numerosos que la población rica y si tienen derecho al voto. Cuando vienes a ver igual nos sorprenden y resulta que la mayoría votó bolsonaro.\n[#9](c9#c-9) los que tienen el poder de decidir eso no van a sufrir las consecuencias de sus decisiones, ni sus descendientes\nEsto refuta la cacareada esferidad de la Tierra y por extensión el calentamiento global, hay inundaciones porque, aún lloviendo normal, la Tierra es plana y hace charco\n¡El Apocalipsis Climático! Millones de refugiados climáticos vagando por un Brasil arrasado, constryendo nuevas ciudades desde cero... venga ya.\nEs que con el coñazo del cambio climático se le da pábulo a cualquier cantamañanas climático que quiera salir en la tele.\nBangladesh no para de inundarse todos los años y no cambian de lugar las ciudades.\nQuizá el notas climático de la noticia no ha pensado en que se pueden construir infraestructuras para evitar las inundaciones.\n[#2](c2#c-2) \"Bangladesh no para de inundarse todos los años y no cambian de lugar las ciudades.\"\nPorque no construyeron las ciudades en donde no para de inundarse todos los años, sino donde nunca se inunda o al menos no severamente. Es lo que tiene el cambio climático que niegas, que cambia las condiciones de vida que antes eran relativamente estables.\n[#2](c2#c-2) [#3](c3#c-3) Ciudad de México se hunde cada año unos cuantos cm y el problema está siendo bastante real.\nEl tema de Bangladesh\nhttps://www.ifad.org/es/web/latest/-/aunque-los-habitantes-de-bangladesh-sean-resilientes-de-no-tomarse-medidas-urgentes-contra-el-cambio-climatico-el-futuro-de-este-fascinante-pais-sera-incierto\nYakarta habia intentado eso\nhttps://www.tiempo.com/noticias/actualidad/yakarta-se-hunde-indonesia-mudanza-capital-isla-de-borneo-nusantara-nivel-del-mar.html\n[#4](c4#c-4) estamos a punto de vivir una distopia, un colapso de estructuras afianzadas en años. Sí terminará habiendo migraciones masivas, guerras del hambre, guerras del agua, energía.\nMuchas cosas tendrían que cambiar, si las planteamos de forma ordenada podríamos reconstruir algunas cosas y evitar mucho sufrimiento. Si las ignoramos vendrán de golpe y habrá mucho más sufrimiento y dolor\n[#3](c3#c-3) Hay zonas en los ríos que aunque no se suelen inundar son zonas donde se va a acumular el agua en caso de crecidas del río.\nPor ejemplo, la marisma del bajo Guadalquivir no sufre inundaciones severas, pero se sabe que como venga un año especialmente lluvioso, toda esa zona va a acabar llena de agua porque es la zona natural de desague del bajo Guadalquivir. Aún así querian los belgas construir una urbanización en plena marisma.\nhttps://www.diariodecadiz.es/noticias-provincia-cadiz/urbanizacion-Trebujena-resurge-sequia-campana_0_1793522221.html\n[#25](c25#c-25) La gente tiende a pensar que el cauce de un río es sólo lo que se ve y además que siempre ha ido por ahí, sin tener en cuenta que los cauces cambian con los años, tanto por acción natural como por la del humano.\nSiempre que voy por un pozo donde me bañaba de guaje, me acuerdo de 3 árboles que ayudé a quitar de la linde de un prado con la yera del río. Al año siguiente este pasó de hacer una S a ir recto y adiós al pozo donde nos bañábamos\n[#2](c2#c-2) Al menos en Cataluña, para construir infraestructuras públicas es necesario que se haga un estudio de inundabilidad del solar en el que se va a construir el instituto, comisaría, ... y dependiendo de la tasa de retorno no se construye en ese emplazamiento.\nDesconozco como es en otros sitios, pero lo lógico es no construir en un sitio que pueda quedar totalmente inundado cada 20 años o menos.\nOtra cosa es que es un territorio como Singapur o Mónaco, que no queda más espacio.",

    "text": "OpenAI ha accidentalmente cancellato prove cruciali raccolte dal New York Times e altri importanti giornali nella loro causa legale riguardante i dati di addestramento dell'IA, secondo quanto riportato in un documento depositato in tribunale mercoledì.\nIl team legale dei giornali aveva impiegato oltre 150 ore per esaminare i dati di addestramento di OpenAI alla ricerca di istanze in cui i loro articoli erano stati inclusi. Tuttavia, il documento non spiega come si sia verificato questo errore o cosa contenessero esattamente i dati cancellati. OpenAI ha ammesso l'errore e ha tentato di recuperare i dati, ma ciò che è riuscita a salvare risulta incompleto e inaffidabile.\nQuesto incidente potrebbe avere importanti ripercussioni sulla causa intentata dal New York Times contro OpenAI lo scorso dicembre. Il giornale sostiene che OpenAI e Microsoft abbiano costruito i loro strumenti di IA copiando e utilizzando milioni di articoli della testata, entrando così in diretta competizione con i suoi contenuti.\nLa cancellazione dei dati complica ulteriormente una battaglia legale già costosa e complessa. Il New York Times ha già speso oltre un milione di dollari in spese legali, una cifra che pochi altri editori possono permettersi. Nel frattempo, OpenAI ha stretto accordi con importanti testate come Axel Springer, Condé Nast e Vox Media, suggerendo che molti editori preferiscano collaborare piuttosto che combattere.\nOpenAI ha rifiutato di unirsi al New York Times nel presentare l'aggiornamento al tribunale. La dichiarazione è stata depositata da Jennifer Maisel, un'avvocata che rappresenta le organizzazioni giornalistiche, per informare formalmente il tribunale sull'accaduto.\n[In una email inviata a The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302606/openai-erases-evidence-in-training-data-lawsuit), il portavoce di OpenAI Jason Deutrom ha dichiarato che l'azienda \"non è d'accordo con le caratterizzazioni fatte\" e presenterà presto una propria risposta. Il New York Times ha declinato la richiesta di commento da parte di The Verge.\nL'attuale disputa tra il New York Times e OpenAI rappresenta un nuovo capitolo in questa evoluzione legale, ponendo domande fondamentali sul valore e la proprietà dell'informazione nell'era dell'IA.\nUn aspetto curioso di questa vicenda è come la tecnologia stessa al centro della controversia possa potenzialmente rivoluzionare il sistema legale. Infatti, i sistemi di IA stanno già venendo utilizzati per analizzare documenti legali e precedenti giurisprudenziali, accelerando e potenzialmente migliorando il processo di ricerca legale.\nL'intelligenza artificiale sta sfidando non solo il nostro concetto di creatività e proprietà intellettuale, ma anche i fondamenti stessi del nostro sistema giuridico.\nDal punto di vista storico, è interessante notare come questa disputa si inserisca in un più ampio dibattito sulla regolamentazione dell'IA. L'Unione Europea, ad esempio, [sta lavorando all'AI Act](https://www.tomshw.it/altro/ai-act-svolta-storica-la-ce-approva-la-prima-legge-per-regolamentare-le-ia-2024-05-21), una legge pionieristica che mira a stabilire un quadro normativo per l'uso dell'IA, incluse disposizioni sulla trasparenza e la responsabilità nell'utilizzo dei dati.\nInsomma, la cancellazione accidentale dei dati da parte di OpenAI non è solo un incidente tecnico, ma un evento che sottolinea la complessità e l'importanza di gestire correttamente le informazioni nell'era dell'IA, aprendo nuovi scenari per il futuro del diritto d'autore e della proprietà intellettuale.",
