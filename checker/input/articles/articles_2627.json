    "title": "Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce Named Jamaican Sports Personality of the Year",
    "text": "After yet another successful year, Jamaican sprint legend Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce has earned her the title of “Jamaican Sports Personality of the Year” for the second consecutive year. This, through the Best Of Jamaica Survey conducted by Jamaicans.com. For over two decades, this survey has been a platform for Jamaicans worldwide to express their admiration for various aspects of Jamaican culture, including sports, music, and food. The annual survey invited Jamaicans and those who cherish Jamaican culture to share their opinions on the best representations of the nation’s culture in their local communities. 2023: A Year of Unmatched Achievements Fraser-Pryce’s 2023 started with a spectacular performance, setting a meeting record at the Spitzen Leichtathletik meeting in Lucerne. She sprinted in her first 100m race of the season, an impressive 10.82 seconds. Her year of successes was further highlighted when she was named the 2023 Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year. This prestigious global recognition came after her record-breaking performance at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon in 2022, where she won a record fifth 100m gold. This placed Fraser-Pryce in a position where she has more world sprint titles than any other athlete. Her ability to consistently run sub-10.7 for 100m sets her apart as one of the greatest sprinters of all time. Recognition Beyond the Track In addition to her athletic prowess, Fraser-Pryce’s contributions to sports and education have been recognized. The University of the West Indies (UWI) honored her with the Alumni Exemplar Sports Award for 2023. This award acknowledges not just her achievements on the track but also her role as an advocate for education and sports. Known affectionately as ‘Mommy Rocket’, based on her Pocket Rocket Foundation, Fraser-Pryce is a role model for aspiring athletes and students As this year also marked the 10th anniversary of the Pocket Rocket Foundation, established by Fraser-Pryce. The foundation celebrated this milestone by awarding academic scholarships and school supplies to 11 Jamaican students Demonstrating her role as a community leader, Fraser-Pryce hosted a Christmas event this year for children, providing gifts, food, and drinks. The Pocket Rocket Foundation has been instrumental in supporting high school student-athletes with scholarships covering tuition, books, lunch, and transportation since 2013. Other Best of Jamaica Award Jamaicans across the world also voted Fraser-Pryce as the “Jamaican of the Year 2023”, a title she shares with politician and former Miss World Lisa Hanna.

    "title": "With pager blasts and airstrikes, Israel unleashes its terror on Lebanon",
    "text": "Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, September 23, 2024. (David Cohen/Flash90)\nOn the afternoon of Sept. 17, my phone buzzed with dozens of messages from friends in Beirut, who described the surreal scenes they had just witnessed. One friend saw a man’s face blow up while he was on a motorbike. Another said his sister was with her 2-year-old when she heard a loud bang, followed by a rush of people running toward them in terror. A third sent a clip of security camera footage from a grocery store, where a man reaches to grab his beeping pager before it explodes in his hand.\nAlthough no one has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, everyone understood very well what had happened: Israel found a way to detonate simultaneously thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members. In our text exchanges, my friends and I began to wonder how the Israelis pulled this off — and if this meant that all electronic devices in Lebanon were now at risk.\nA similar attack occurred the following day, this time targeting Hezbollah’s walkie-talkies. In one highly publicized incident, an explosion at a funeral for Hezbollah members killed in the first attack sent mourners scrambling in fear. Across the two days, around 3,500 people were reported injured, many still in serious condition, and at least 42 people killed, including two children.\nWe later learned that the Hungarian company from which Hezbollah had acquired its communication devices was, in fact, an Israeli front. The devices were not intercepted and then bugged, but manufactured by Israel from the start — a “modern day Trojan horse,” as the New York Times called it. This was a sizable security breach for Hezbollah, which even the group’s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, somberly acknowledged in a speech two days later.\nBut it now seems that the attacks of last week were the prelude for a more traditional — and more deadly — open phase of war. At the time of writing, Israel has launched multiple airstrikes throughout south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley, and countless Lebanese civilians are currently fleeing the area following “immediate” evacuation orders from the Israeli army.\nIsraeli soldiers seen in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. September 19, 2024. (Michael Giladi/Flash90)\nSo far, at least 492 people have been reported killed, including 35 children, and 1,645 wounded, and casualties are expected to rise. This makes Sept. 23, to quote Lebanese journalist Timour Azhari, the “deadliest day in memory in [the] Lebanon-Israel conflict,” and with Hezbollah launching rockets deeper into Israel, de-escalation is increasingly out of reach.\n[ ](/spip.php?article72062#outil_sommaire)‘This cannot be the new normal’\nFor Justin Salhani, a journalist based in Beirut, the psychological impact of the pager attacks on Lebanon’s civilian population cannot be underestimated. People are “already fearful,” Salhani told +972, noting how many Lebanese have remained deeply traumatized since the devastating Beirut port explosion on Aug. 4, 2020.\nFour years later, the harrowing scenes in Lebanese hospitals were repeating themselves. At the American University of Beirut’s medical center, one of the country’s largest and most prestigious facilities, it took two days for doctors and nurses to attend to the thousands of injuries from the first pager attack, according to a communications staffer at the hospital who spoke with Salhani. This was before the second wave of injuries from the walkie-talkie attacks.\nSalhani and I were talking shortly before the Sept. 20 Israeli airstrike on the Dahiya neighborhood in southern Beirut, the third one this year, which killed Hezbollah’s operations commander Ibrahim Aqil, other senior members of the elite Radwan unit, and several civilians, including three children. Yet the device explosions stand out for their wide-ranging consequences — “not just for Hezbollah,” Salhani noted, but the future of warfare.\nAn Israeli fighter jet flies over the northern Israeli city of Haifa, September 23, 2024. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nIn the words of Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the pager attacks “represent a new development in warfare where communication tools become weapons.” He condemned the tactic as a violation of international law and a possible war crime, affirming that “this cannot be the new normal.”\nBut given Israel’s history of using warfare to test new military technology and strategy, there is no indication that Türk’s warning will have any impact — and the pager attacks may, like other lethal Israeli innovations, become quickly normalized.\nGaza has long been Israel’s preferred military laboratory, and Israeli start-ups that market “battle-tested” weapons have reaped the benefits. This has turned Gaza into a place where the most morbid world records have been broken — home, for example, to the highest percentage of child amputees, with around 10 children per day losing one or both of their legs to Israeli bombs, according to the UN.\nBut Lebanon, too, has been a key battleground for Israel to develop its military stratagem. First outlined by IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot during the 2006 war, the infamous Dahiya doctrine endorses “disproportionate” force to “the enemy’s actions and the threat it poses,” and includes specifically targeting civilian infrastructure “to an extent that will demand long and expensive reconstruction processes,” according to a 2009 report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel.\nAnyone affected by Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon instinctively understands the Dahiya doctrine. And after the nearly year-long genocide in Gaza, which has seen the relentless destruction of entire cities, and recent statements from Israeli leaders, Lebanese citizens are firm in conviction that the Israeli military will not hesitate to inflict massive civilian casualties. Last November, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared that “what we can do in Gaza, we can do in Beirut,” while last week, IDF Major General Ori Gordin proposed re-occupying south Lebanon to create a “buffer zone” with Israel.\nIsraelis watch airstrikes in southern Lebanon, near the Israeli border, September 23, 2024. (David Cohen/Flash90)\nAdd to this the explicitly genocidal rhetoric emanating from Israeli society against the Palestinian people in Gaza, with both traditional and social media consumed by open calls for genocide, as well as by Israelis soldiers themselves in Gaza. To anyone who has experienced Israeli occupation and bombardment in Lebanon, the reports, images, and videos coming out of Gaza feel eerily familiar — and now they fear they will witness the same in their own country.\n[ ](/spip.php?article72062#outil_sommaire)Hezbollah’s difficult calculus\nAt the beginning of 2022, I argued in +972 that “Hezbollah couldn’t ask for a better enemy than Israel,” given how Israeli escalatory rhetoric and actions have helped Hezbollah justify the maintenance of its military hegemony in Lebanon. This is only more true today: pointing to Israel’s actions in Gaza, and now increasingly in Lebanon, Hezbollah can tell its supporters that no compromise with the Israeli state is possible, and that without armed resistance, Lebanese civilians will suffer the crimes that begin the moment Israeli troops enter any Arab territory.\nAs some analysts have pointed out, the Israeli attacks are likely to drive Hezbollah further underground — for some members, quite literally. In August, Hezbollah released a Hebrew-subtitled video, reposted by Israel’s own Foreign Affairs Ministry on YouTube, showing a hidden tunnel in Lebanon wide enough to fit large missile launchers and a convoy of trucks. It is not known how many similar tunnels exist.\nKeeping the extent of this underground network a secret is naturally part of Hezbollah’s psychological warfare against Israel. It is a way of reminding the latter that — unlike Hamas and the densely populated Gaza Strip — Hezbollah operates in a much larger territory with no such restrictions, with much greater physical access to its allies in Iran and Syria than Hamas under Israel’s blockade.\nA woman watches the speech of Secretary-general of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah at her home in Mishmar David, September 19, 2024. (Nati Shohat/Flash90)\nMeanwhile, threats by Israeli leaders to apply its “Gaza model” to Lebanon risks pushing some Hezbollah members to employ more irregular warfare tactics, which the Israeli army has historically had difficulty confronting, such as ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and other cross-border incursions.\nThis is especially true if Israel attempts another ground invasion of south Lebanon — a territory that Hezbollah has operated from as a guerrilla group since the 1980s, with increasingly sophisticated weapons after each round of fighting, and a more battle-hardened force since their interventions in Syria.\nIn other ways, however, Hezbollah is in a precarious domestic position. There is no sizable appetite for a war with Israel in a country that is still feeling the effects of one of the world’s worst economic crises, especially since the Beirut port explosion. The group’s decision to support Hamas after October 7 has, for these same reasons, also been highly controversial. It is, as of now, also unclear to what extent Hezbollah can rely on Iran’s direct support if that would bring an all-out war to Tehran’s own doorstep.\nBut without international pressure to stop the openly exterminationist policies of the Netanyahu government, Hezbollah may be pushed to a point of no return — with unimaginable consequences for the region.\nElia Ayoub",

This walkout, involving 33,000 machinists, threatens to halt production of Boeing's top-selling jetliners and compound the company's existing financial woes and reputational damage. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Seattle | Updated: 14-09-2024 00:27 IST | Created: 14-09-2024 00:27 IST - Country: - United States Boeing's blue-collar workers in the Pacific Northwest took to picket lines on Friday, rejecting a proposed contract that aimed to increase wages by 25% over four years. The strike involves 33,000 machinists and is expected to shut down production of Boeing's best-selling jetliners, adding to the company's ongoing financial struggles. The union, representing a majority of the workers, overwhelmingly rejected the contract as inadequate. Workers cited soaring living costs in the Pacific Northwest as a key reason, arguing that the proposed wage increases fail to keep pace with inflation. The company's stock plummeted over 3% following the strike announcement. The strike poses a significant challenge to Boeing's new CEO and marks another hurdle for the aerospace giant, which has already suffered billions in losses. As negotiations are set to resume, both sides remain committed to finding a resolution to this impasse. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "text": "Since January 1, 2019, when Vincent Chaperon became Chef de Cave of Dom Pérignon, this thoughtful and passionate winemaker has sought to nurture Dom Pérignon’s Patrimoine de Création (the wine’s unrivaled creative heritage) with ever more inspiring experiences built around its vintages and his 13-year apprenticeship under his predecessor, the legendary Richard Geoffroy. As Chaperon observes, “We must intimately know our vineyards and our wines; we have to pamper them, learn to love them to create assemblages that strive for harmony.” The storied Champagne’s vision and mission to deliver new experiences and new vintages that surprise and delight is guided by harmony as a source of emotion. From now until February 18, 2024, a new face of the unique Dom Pérignon Maison is available to discerning clients of the prestigious hotel Le Bristol Paris in a spectacular collaboration with the hotel’s three-Michelin-starred Executive Chef Eric Frechon. Combining discreet luxury with savoir faire, this icon of French elegance and art de vivre is located at one of the city’s most important addresses on the famous Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré and, notably, was the first hotel in France to receive the renowned designation of “Palace,” a mark of the highest distinction. Together, Frechon and Chaperon have created Le Bristol Paris X Dom Pérignon: a combination of gastronomic excellence with four specially selected and rare Dom Pérignon vintages; a partnership designed to express the finest qualities of food and wine; a sublime adventure through meticulously crafted pairings of Dom Pérignon’s best-in-class millesimes; and the very height of French gastronomy. An exclusive private dining room for a maximum of six guests has been specially created in the center of Le Bristol Paris’ majestic courtyard garden, just yards from the exclusive Rue du Faubourg St Honoré. In this remarkable and intimate space, diners will embrace an experiential journey, while in a sensational trompe l’oeil effect, one-way mirrors will preserve the privacy of participants while creating an alluring effect from the exterior—a place to see without being seen. The evening Le Bristol Paris X Dom Pérignon begins with a selection of canapés served in the contemporary lines and glamorous finishes of the bar—truly a world first—where exceptional cuvées normally only offered by the bottle are served by the glass to accompany a tantalizing selection of hors d’oeuvres. As a stand-alone experience, the extraordinary fusion of the two minds of chef and cellar master would be memorable. However, the hors d’oeuvres are merely a curtain raiser, the overture if you will, to set in motion a dialogue between two artists whose mastery of their individual crafts is only surpassed by the extraordinary fusion of their two visions. Their shared and passionate quest for the quintessential flavor pairings together blend seamlessly to create the perfect balance of food, wine, and surroundings that make for an unforgettable evening. The pairing opens with a caviar de Sologne matched to Dom Pérignon’s exceptional Vintage 2013, moving on to the exquisitely classic Noix de Saint Jacques (scallops) served with the outstanding refinement of the Rosé Vintage 2009. This hint of the ocean introduces a spectacular pan-seared wild turbot with white truffle and the remarkable Dom Pérignon Vintage 2004 Plénitude 2 cuvée. Dishes are crafted in outstanding detail to highlight the poetry that occurs when the creations of a decorated chef meet the cultivated nuances of the world’s finest Champagnes. A particular highlight is the fourth course of Poularde de Bresse en vessie, in which a meticulously prepared Bresse chicken (widely regarded as the finest in France) is stuffed with foie gras, truffles, and other flavorings, then poached in chicken broth. Accompanying this is the somewhat more mature Dom Pérignon Plénitude 2 Vintage 2002, the greater richness of the older wine proving to be the ideal partner to a dish with its roots in early French cuisine. How does one follow a repast of such sumptuous flavors prepared with such precision and balance? The Plénitude 2 Vintage 2002 cuvée, a wine that caresses the taste buds like falling stars proved to be the perfect partner to the presentation of an exquisite black truffle crème glacée served with a hazelnut emulsion and gianduja chocolate. It’s an apt metaphor for this exceptional, limited-time-only experience, something to catch and cherish before it fades gently away. Le Bristol Paris X Dom Pérignon includes a tasting and Champagne dinner, available now through February 18, 2024, for €1,200 per person, only with reservation. Dom Pérignon Pop-up Bar in Le Bristol’s garden, upon availability with reservation, Tuesday to Saturday, from 6pm. Enjoy responsibly.",

    "text": "Winter storms and cinema closures in North America didn’t dampen the opening weekend for “ Mean Girls. ” The Paramount release, adapted from the Broadway musical and the 2004 Tina Fey movie, earned $28 million in its first three days in theaters according to studio estimates Sunday. Not accounting for inflation, that’s more than the $24.4 million the first movie made in its opening weekend.\nThe “Mean Girls” competition over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend featured several new releases, including the Jason Statham action movie “ The Beekeeper \" and the Jay-Z produced biblical satire “The Book of Clarence,\" in addition to a slew of awards contenders capitalizing on buzz from recent nominations and the Golden Globes .\nAs with “Barbie,” another enthusiastically pink movie, female audiences made up the vast majority (76%) of opening weekend ticket buyers for “Mean Girls.” According to exit polls, 70% were between the ages of 18 and 34, which, yes, means that it had appeal for audiences who hadn’t been born when Regina George was first introduced to the world.\n“The property is iconic,” said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s president of domestic distribution. “Tina Fey is legendary and her contemporary twist has resonated with audiences, particularly the female audience.”\nThis iteration of “Mean Girls” stars Angourie Rice, Auli’i Cravalho and Reneé Rap, who played Regina on stage. It was originally planned to go straight to streaming on Paramount+, but the studio pivoted after test scores were positive. Social media played a big part in getting the word out and “Mean Girls” also inspired groups of friends to go to the movies together. An estimated 40% went with two or more friends.\nFey returned to write and co-star in the new film, which was directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. and cost a reported $36 million to produce. Reviews have been more positive than not, with a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences gave it a B CinemaScore which may not bode especially well for word-of-mouth appeal. Recent musicals like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” scored in the A-range. The studio is optimistic after this weekend though. It also made $6.5 million from 16 international markets.\n“It’s no secret that the release calendar is a little light for the first couple months of the year and because of the reception to this film we stand a chance of broadening this audience,” Aronson said. “It really is a crowd-pleaser.”\nAmazon and MGM’s “The Beekeeper\" debuted in second place with an estimated $16.8 million from 3,303 theaters. Men made up approximately 62% of ticket buyers and audiences overall gave it a B+ CinemaScore. By the end of the four-day weekend, the studio expects it to have made $19.1 million. Miramax handled the international distribution for “The Beekeper,” which also grossed $20.4 million from 49 territories.\nThird place went to “Wonka,” which added $8.4 million in its fifth weekend. The Timothée Chalamet-led musical has now made over $178 million domestically and $500 million globally.\n“Musicals are on a roll,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It seems like a lot of studios run away from putting musical on their films for fear of limiting their audience pool, but I think this is a genre Hollywood should embrace and highlight.”\nThe Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy “Anyone But You,” a Sony release, is turning into a bit of a sleeper success as well, making nearly $7 million in its fourth weekend. By Monday, its domestic total should be around $56.5 million. Universal and Illumination’s “Migration” rounded out the top five with $6.2 million in its fourth weekend.\nNot everything landed this weekend, though. “ The Book of Clarence ,” a faith-based comedy/drama with a starry, ensemble cast including LaKeith Stanfield, Omar Sy, RJ Cyler, David Oyelowo, Alfre Woodard and Teyana Taylor is not off to a promising start. The Legendary Pictures release opened to an estimated $2.6 million from just over 2,000 locations.\nWritten and directed by the British singer-songwriter Jeymes Samuel (stage name The Bullitts), it was self-consciously styled after Golden Age biblical epics like “The Ten Commandments.” It has also gotten mixed reviews, with 68% on Rotten Tomatoes and a B CinemaScore.\nThe Walt Disney Co. sent its 2020 Pixar film “Soul” to movie theaters this weekend as well, where it made $429,000 from 1350 locations in North America. It's the first of several Pixar movies, including “Luca\" and “Turning Red,” that Disney is bringing to theaters this winter after all had streaming-only releases on Disney+ during the pandemic.\nHollywood's awards season is also in full swing, and though many top contenders are already available to watch at home, some are still rolling out in theaters and hoping to capitalize on new nominations and awards shows like last weekend's Golden Globes. “Poor Things,” which was a big winner, added $1.8 million from only 580 theaters. “All of Us Strangers” took in $474,000 from 120 screens. “American Fiction” expanded nationwide and made $1.9 million from 625 screens. “The Zone of Interest,” playing on 25 screens, also crossed $1 million.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday.\n1. “Mean Girls,” $28 million.\n2. “The Beekeeper,” $16.8 million.\n3. “Wonka,” $8.4 million.\n4. “Anyone But You,” $6.9 million.\n5. “Migration,” $6.2 million.\n6. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” $5.3 million.\n7. “Night Swim,” $4.7 million.\n8. “The Boys in the Boat,” $3.5 million.\n9. “The Book of Clarence,”$2.6 million.\n10. “The Iron Claw,” $2.4 million.\n ",

    "text": "La violencia experimentó un aumento del 8% en Haití entre octubre y diciembre de 2023 respecto al trimestre anterior, para alcanzar un total de más de 8,400 víctimas desde enero de ese año, informó este jueves el Departamento de Derechos Humanos de la Oficina Integrada de Naciones Unidas en Haití (Binuh).\nLa expansión de la violencia por parte de grupos criminales se produjo particularmente en el departamento de Artibonite y en la periferia sur de la capital, con un aumento de la violencia sexual en varios municipios, según el último informe trimestral de la organización.\nLa representante especial del secretario general de la ONU y jefa de la Binuh, María Isabel Salvador, enfatizó que esta violencia conduce a una inseguridad crónica, amenazando la estabilidad y el bienestar de los ciudadanos.\nEl documento también revela el impacto en los niños, con al menos 53 menores víctimas de violencia o involucrados en actividades criminales, y destaca los obstáculos existentes para entregar ayuda humanitaria o para desplazarse en vehículos debido al control de las carreteras por parte de las pandillas armadas.\nPor otra parte, el texto señala que el sistema judicial, afectado por la violencia y problemas estructurales, muestra algunos signos de mejora con medidas para reducir la prisión preventiva durante este período, en el que se procesaron 400 casos que resultaron en la liberación de al menos 258 personas.\nSin embargo, las operaciones policiales han visto un aumento de víctimas, lo que pone de relieve la persistente inseguridad, de acuerdo con un comunicado de la ONU.\nAnte esta situación, el informe llama a la comunidad internacional a mantener a Haití en la agenda y respalda la importancia de desplegar una misión multinacional de apoyo a la seguridad, que estaría liderada por Kenia y en la que participarían fuerzas de Bahamas, Antigua, Barbuda y Jamaica, aunque su entrada en acción se mantiene en suspenso.\nLa nota resalta el compromiso y la determinación de los Estados miembros de Naciones Unidas para enviar una fuerza internacional a Haití, tal y como solicitara el primer ministro haitiano, Ariel Henry, en octubre de 2022, sin que se haya establecido una fecha y un plan concreto de actuación para pacificar el país caribeño.",
