Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods The NBA has been a business since it started in 1946. Throughout the years, commissioners have done their best to make it the best league in the world, and they've reached that feat for quite a while now. But change is inevitable, and even the association isn't immune to it.\nPatrick Bet-David, a podcaster, broke down an interesting take on the revenue that the league has been getting. There's no denying that there's been a decline in viewership for the past few seasons, which has affected their earnings. Despite having major sponsors, they're still on a gradual decline.\nBet-David pointed out that the league has lost half of the U.S. On Christmas, they had five games but only generated $14.2 million. The NFL, on the other hand, only had three games but earned $85.6 million.\n•\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Expand Tweet He brought up the topic of the views the league had in 2022 compared to the views that the NFL had. The association had 4.3 million views per game while the football league had 21.9 million views per game.\nIn the past, commissioner Adam Silver mentioned that the decline of cable TV has affected the league's revenue. However, Bet-David believes that it should have affected the NFL since they both rely on views to generate revenue.\nIn 2022, the league ranked third in revenues among all the major leagues in America. The NFL had $17 billion, which puts them at the top. The second place belongs to the MLB, which had $10.5 billion. The NBA takes the third spot with $9.6 billion. The NHL and MLS take the fourth and fifth spots with $4.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\nYou might also be interested in reading this: Where & how to watch LA Lakers vs Charlotte Hornets: TV channel List, online live stream details, & start time\nWhat are some of the reasons for the NBA's decline in viewership? There are a good number of reasons the NBA can bring up when addressing its decline in viewership. Bet-David lists a few of them that have affected the fans losing interest in the league.\nExpand Tweet They don't cater to fans According to Bet-David, successful leagues listen to their fans. Unfortunately, that hasn't been what the association has done for the past few years, and has listened and catered mostly to what the players want.\nThis has caused most stars in the league to be entitled, often getting what they want.",

La Dirección Xeral de Emerxencias ha activado la alerta naranja para mañana, sábado, por temporal costero en el litoral de la provincia de A Coruña.\nSegún la Aemet, el fenómeno meteorológico adverso empezará a media tarde del sábado, sobre las 18:00 horas, en la costa coruñesa y se extenderá el domingo a todo el litoral gallego. Las peores horas en la costa coruñesa serán durante la tarde del sábado, desde las 18:00 horas hasta la medianoche.\nHabrá mar combinada del oeste con olas de hasta siete metros y vientos del suroeste de fuerza siete.\nLa borrasca va a dejar también rachas de vientos de nivel de alaerta amarilla en las franjas costeras de A Coruña y de Lugo.\nAnte esta situación, desde la Xunta recuerdan la importancia de mantenerse alejado de la línea de costa, como diques o paseos marítimos. También se piden que se extremen las medidas de seguridad a la hora de realizar cualquier actividad en el mar y que se revisen los cabos y amarres de las embarcaciones.\nLa borrasca Gerrit llegó a Galicia, dejando en las últimas horas lluvias por prácticmente toda la geografía gallega. Hoy las lluvias se reptirán en muchos puntos de la ciudad, mientras que en otros habrá un pequeña tregua hasta el domingo, Nochevieja, cuando se prevé una jornada en la que las lluvias sean las protagonistas.",

    "title": "Graphic simulation shows exactly what a nuclear explosion would do to a human body",
    "text": "Disturbing video describes the precise injuries that would be inflicted on the human body in the various blast zones of a nuclear explosion. While it's obvious that being right at the centre of the blast would result in instant death, if you're located further away things are not so quick. Advert The simulation places someone at various distances from the explosion and describes the [injuries](https://www.unilad.com/health) you might expect to sustain, and if you would survive. And a fair warning, this is going to get very grim. In the video the example given is the Trinity Test - an explosion equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT which in nuclear terms is tiny. It begins with zone 1, around 1.27km from the centre, where the worst injuries you could expect would be 'light blast damage'. Advert This might sound like getting off scot free, but in reality it means being permanently blinded if you happen to be looking at the blast from burnt out retinas. Prior to the shockwaves, nuclear blasts give off a huge amount of intense light and heat. You can see the results of this in photos of [Hiroshima](https://www.unilad.com/history) where shadows of people caught in the blast were scorched onto the buildings behind them. Advert At this distance, you could also have second degree burns and hearing loss. In zone 2, you have a pulse of [thermal radiation](https://www.unilad.com/science) causing third degree burns and ear drum rupture. Third degree are the burns which completely destroy your nerves, so at least you wouldn't feel the pain! Or anything else, for that matter. This brings us to zone 3, which has 'heavy blast damage' and where death is more or less guaranteed. Advert It includes fourth degree burns, which are the most severe, as well as internal haemorrhaging and traumatic brain injury. In zone 4, close to the fireball, you are incinerated alive and dismembered by the shockwave. At least it would be quick. Finally, we have the fireball itself where what's left of you will be carried off when the wind blows and infect [crops and fields](https://www.unilad.com/nature) with radioactivity. Advert Of course, as shown in graphic detail in the 1984 British [Australian](https://www.unilad.com/australia) film Threads, those people who are vaporised in the initial stages of a nuclear war are the lucky ones. The [movie](https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv) goes into horrifying detail about the collapse of society in the [UK](https://www.unilad.com/uk-news) after an international nuclear exchange. This sees Britain wracked by [food](https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink) riots, military authoritarianism, and even the destruction of language and communication itself, as [education](https://www.unilad.com/education) breaks down and the country is forced back to subsistence farming. The final shot of a woman living in this grim post-apocalyptic world screaming in horror at the sight of her stillborn child really hammers home that instant disintegration is probably the best option in nuclear armageddon.

    "title": "2-0: Dinamarca sentencia en la recta final ante una Suiza con nueve",
    "text": "Dos goles de Dorgu y Højbjerg en los últimos minutos le dieron el triunfo a Dinamarca (2-0) en su estreno en la Liga de Naciones frente a una Suiza que acabó con nueve jugadores, en un partido disputado, equilibrado y con una segunda parte accidentada. Dinamarca llegaba con varias bajas de peso -Christensen, Højlund- y con entrenador interino, Lars Knudsen, por la baja por estrés de Morten Wieghorst, que había asumido el puesto de forma temporal tras la salida de Kasper Hjulmand al acabar la Eurocopa. Knudsen mantuvo el 3-4-3 habitual de la etapa de Hjulmand, pero a los daneses les costó meterse en el partido frente a una Suiza que tenía más la pelota pero tampoco llegaba demasiado, en medio de las imprecisiones de ambos equipos. Avisaron los suizos primeros con una buena internada de Rodríguez, cuyo pase cabeceó centrado Widmer, que poco después puso un gran centro al que no llegó por poco Vargas. Dinamarca despertó en los últimos minutos con varias ocasiones: la más clara, una combinación entre el debutante Grønbæk, muy activo, y Eriksen, que dejó solo a Dolberg frente a Kobel, que salvó lo que parecía el primer gol. En el mejor momento de los daneses, Vargas, dentro del área, mandó un gran pase a Aebischer, cuyo remate desde el centro evitó en el último momento Højbjerg, que estrenaba capitanía tras la retirada de la selección de Simon Kjær. El partido dio un vuelco al poco de empezar la segunda parte. Elvedi se durmió, Dolberg le robó la cartera y el central suizo lo derribó al borde del área cuando se iba solo. Contra un rival en inferioridad y mucho tiempo, Dinamarca dio un paso adelante. Suiza cerró líneas, reforzó el medio y dejó únicamente arriba a Embolo, un dolor de muelas para la zaga danesa toda la noche. Dinamarca movía y movía la pelota, pero los huecos no aparecían y las ideas tampoco sobraban. Sólo en algún tiro lejano se veía exigido Kobel. El partido parecía encaminado al 0-0. Knudsen movió de nuevo el banco, sacó a un defensa y refrescó las bandas. Ni un minuto había pasado cuando otro debutante recién salido al campo, Dorgu, enganchó una pelota en el área pequeña y adelantó a Dinamarca. El gol no le sentó nada bien a Suiza, ni a Xhaqa, que perdió la cabeza cuatro minutos después de haber visto una amarilla y dejó a su equipo con nueve. Højbjerg, en el descuento, cerró el partido con un remate colocado a centro de Skov Olsen y dio a Dinamarca su primera victoria y el liderato provisional. En tres días, los daneses recibirán a Serbia. Suiza, a España. - Ficha técnica: 2 - Dinamarca: Schmeichel; Nelsson (Dorgy, m.81), Vestergaard, Andersen; Kristiansen, Hjulmand (Nørgaard, m.90), Højbjerg, Bah; Eriksen (Damsgaard, m.62), Dolberg (Wind, m.62), Grønbæk (Skov Olsen, m.81). 0 - Suiza: Kobel; Rodríguez, Akanji, Elvedi; Aebischer (Amdouni, m.90), Xhaka, Freuler, Widmer (Omeragic, m.65); Vargas (Wüthrich, m.53), Embolo (Duah, m.90), Rieder (Zakaria, m.65).

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.
