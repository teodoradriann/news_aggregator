    "title": "Close China-Pakistan ties ‘choice of history’: Xi Jinping greets new Pakistan President - The Hindu",
    "text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping on March 10 congratulated Asif Ali Zardari on his election as the Pakistan President , saying that the “iron-clad friendship” between the two countries is a “choice of history” and the “strategic significance” of the ties has become more “prominent” in the light of current changes in the world. Mr. Zardari, the husband of late Pakistan Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto was overwhelmingly elected as the 14th President of Pakistan on Saturday, becoming the only civilian president of the coup-prone country for a second time. Mr. Zardari, the co-chairperson of the Pakistan Peoples Party, was the joint candidate of the ruling alliance of the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). In his message to Mr. Zardari on Sunday, Mr. Xi said \"China and Pakistan are good neighbours, good friends, good partners and good brothers, adding that the two countries' iron-clad friendship is a choice of history and a precious treasure of the two peoples.\" Mr. Xi said that \"the two countries have in recent years maintained close high-level exchanges, supported each other on issues concerning their respective core interests and major concerns, achieved fruitful results in the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and maintained a high level of development of bilateral relations,\" state-run Xinhua news agency reported. India has objected to China over the $60 billion CPEC connecting China’s Xinjiang with Gwadar port in Balochistan as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Mr. Xi in his message said, that as the world is confronted with accelerated changes unseen in a century, the strategic significance of China-Pakistan relations has become more prominent. Mr. Xi said he highly regards the development of China-Pakistan relations, and is ready to work with President Zardari to carry forward the traditional friendship between China and Pakistan, advance practical cooperation in various fields, push for greater development of China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, accelerate the building of an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, so as to better benefit the two peoples. Earlier, Mr. Xi greeted Shehbaz Sharif on being elected as Pakistan’s Prime Minister . The return of Mr. Shehbaz and his brother Nawaz Sharif as well as Mr. Zardari at the helm of Pakistan’s politics and government in the midst of chaos and severe economic crisis in Pakistan is viewed with a sense of relief here as all three of them over their years in power in the past few decades maintained close ties with Chinese leaders and furthered the strategic ties with Beijing viewed widely as a strategic alliance against India. China had an uneasy relationship with former prime minister Imran Khan's government which was blamed for the slow pace of $60 billion CPEC. China has been providing forex loans and rollover of its debt periodically to bail out Pakistan which is facing a severe economic crisis. Recent reports from Islamabad said China has agreed to roll over a $2 billion loan due to be paid in March.",

    "text": "Enhancing Early Treatment Strategies in Hidradenitis Suppurativa [Kelly Martin](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79570)Updated: 11-07-2024 05:18 PM Understanding Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and often painful skin condition affecting many individuals globally. It is characterized by inflamed lumps, abscesses, and lesions primarily in skin folds. Approximately 1% of the population in various regions experiences this condition, which is frequently misunderstood or misdiagnosed. The misdiagnosis can lead to significant delays in proper treatment and, as a result, worse health outcomes for patients. Importance of Timely Diagnosis and Treatment In recent studies, it has become clear that early diagnosis and intervention is crucial in managing HS effectively. When patients receive the correct diagnosis sooner, it opens doors to more proactive treatment options, including advanced therapies that can substantially alter the disease's progression. Early treatment is particularly vital for those experiencing moderate cases, as it can prevent the condition from worsening over time. Addressing Diagnosis Challenges One of the central challenges highlighted in discussions regarding HS management is the frequency of misdiagnosis, with conditions like acne being incorrectly identified instead. This misalignment of diagnosis highlights an urgent need for greater awareness among healthcare providers. Improving diagnostic accuracy is paramount to ensuring patients receive appropriate and timely treatment. Advancements in Treatment Options Recently, advancements in biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment landscape for HS. Treatments like adalimumab and secukinumab offer new hope for patients suffering from moderate to severe cases. These therapies have shown promising efficacy when used early in the treatment process and stand to reshape prescribing practices significantly by emphasizing their use in moderate cases. Market Growth Trends in HS Treatment As awareness and diagnosis of HS improve, coupled with the introduction of innovative treatment options, the market outlook for HS management appears bright. Recent estimates suggest that the number of diagnosed and treated patients could more than double in the coming years. This anticipated growth demonstrates the ongoing need for innovative therapies and support systems for patients suffering from HS. The Role of Biologics in Transformative Care With the continual evolution of treatment methodologies, biologics have emerged as cornerstone therapies for HS management. Physicians are increasingly recognizing the necessity and potential benefits of early biologic intervention, which can enhance treatment response and adherence among patients. These shifts could lead to better health outcomes and an overall improved quality of life for individuals affected by HS. Future Directions for HS Care Looking forward, the focus should remain on enhancing patient support and access to these innovative therapies. Developing targeted strategies—such as promoting multidisciplinary care and improving education among healthcare providers—will significantly advance HS management and outcomes. By fostering greater collaboration among specialists, healthcare systems can work towards better supporting individuals living with Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Alice B. Gottlieb, MD, PhD, who is a notable expert in the field, emphasizes the importance of these advancements. Her advocacy for early intervention and biologic therapies showcases a commitment to addressing the unmet needs of HS patients effectively. By harnessing the potential of innovative healthcare solutions, significant improvements in patient outcomes are within reach. Frequently Asked Questions What is Hidradenitis Suppurativa? Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin condition characterized by painful lumps and scarring, primarily occurring in skin folds. Why is early diagnosis important for HS? Early diagnosis enables timely and appropriate treatment, which can significantly enhance patient outcomes and prevent disease progression. What role do biologics play in HS treatment? Biologics have revolutionized HS treatment, showing effective results when administered early in the course of the disease. How is the HS market projected to grow? The HS market is expected to grow rapidly, with estimates indicating the number of diagnosed patients could more than double by the years ahead. What strategies can improve HS care in the future? Strategies include enhancing awareness among providers, improving access to advanced therapies, and fostering collaboration among healthcare specialists.

    "text": "PARIS, France — White or reflective paint is more effective at cooling cities than covering roofs in solar panels or greenery, scientists say, and could offer some relief on extremely hot summer days.\nTwo separate studies looked at the effect of 'cool roofing' and found using white or reflective coatings could reduce outdoor city temperatures by up to 2 degrees Celsius.\nScientists at University College London (UCL) used a model of Greater London to test various cooling methods against its hottest days of 2018, when the city endured a record-breaking summer.\nThe results, published on Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that if adopted widely, cool roofs could reduce the surrounding temperature between 1.2C to 2C.\nOther approaches, like planting vegetation at street level or installing solar panels, provided a much smaller cooling effect at about 0.3C on average across London, the study found.\nCovering roofs in greenery had a \"negligible\" impact on temperatures, it found, though could offer other benefits like better water draining and habitats for wildlife.\n\"We comprehensively tested multiple methods that cities like London could use to adapt to and mitigate warming temperatures, and found that cool roofs were the best way to keep temperatures down during extremely hot summer days,\" said the study's lead author, Oscar Brousse from UCL.\n\"Other methods had various important side benefits, but none were able to reduce outdoor urban heat to nearly the same level.\"\nScientists also found that air conditioning, which transfers heat from inside buildings to the outside, could warm the environment by as much as 1C in dense central London.\n\"By reflecting rather than absorbing heat, cool roofs have the dual benefit of not only cooling the outside urban environment but the inside of buildings as well,\" the report said\n'Minimally intrusive' A separate study published in March looked at real-world results from painting not just roofs, but also roads and outside walls white in an industrial district of Singapore.\nResearchers demonstrated that overall temperatures were reduced up to 2C in the afternoon, helping pedestrians feel 1.5C cooler in tropical climes.\nLighter surfaces reflect heat rather than absorbing it, an effect known as albedo.\nSurfaces with high albedo include snow and ice, or light-coloured urban materials. By contrast, asphalt has low albedo, absorbing more energy and therefore heat, as do oceans and forests.\nRoofing made of white plastic materials have been found in other studies to reflect 80 percent of sunlight that reaches it.\nAmong other locations, cool roofing has already been rolled out in Greece, which is vulnerable to scorching summer highs, and parts of India where heatwaves can be extreme.\nSome experiments painting roads and footpaths white have proven less popular, with some complaints about glare and dirty surfaces in cities that tested this approach in the United States and France.\nCities are 'heat islands' that experience higher temperatures than their surroundings, with energy from the sun absorbed in buildings and roads.\nAs the world's population continues to migrate to cities, and heatwaves become longer and stronger because of climate change, finding ways to adapt will become a priority for urban planners.\nWhite roofing was \"a minimally intrusive solution for urban cooling that has an immediate effect compared to other options\" that require more intervention, said E V S Kiran Kumar Donthu, the lead author of the Singapore study.",

    "title": "Nissan to Launch First Plug-In Hybrid Rogue SUV in 2025, Expanding Hybrid Lineup",
    "text": "Nissan is set to enter the U.S. hybrid market with its first-ever plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), the Rogue compact SUV. The Japanese automaker confirmed that the Rogue PHEV will hit dealerships in 2025, marking a significant step toward expanding Nissan’s eco-friendly offerings. This introduction comes as part of the company’s broader strategy to electrify its lineup in the U.S., a market where Nissan has already been successful with electric vehicles like the Leaf.\nThe new Rogue PHEV will share its platform and components with the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, thanks to the automaker’s partnership with Mitsubishi and Renault through the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Mitsubishi’s Outlander PHEV has already been well-received, giving Nissan a solid foundation for its plug-in hybrid debut. The Outlander PHEV pairs a 2.4-liter gasoline engine with two electric motors, delivering a combined 248 horsepower—likely making the Rogue PHEV significantly more powerful than its current gasoline-only counterpart.\nA More Powerful Rogue The current gasoline-only Nissan Rogue features a 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. The new plug-in hybrid variant, with its increased power output of 248 horsepower, will offer enhanced performance while still prioritizing fuel efficiency. The dual electric motors will not only boost overall horsepower but will also enable a certain amount of electric-only driving.\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, which the Rogue PHEV is expected to closely resemble, offers 28 miles of electric driving range according to EPA ratings. In real-world highway testing, it achieved around 24 miles of all-electric range, which could serve as a benchmark for the upcoming Rogue PHEV. Nissan enthusiasts can anticipate similar capabilities in the new model, though official figures for the Rogue PHEV’s electric range are yet to be confirmed.\nNissan’s Broader Electrification Plan In addition to the 2025 Rogue PHEV, Nissan is also planning to introduce its innovative e-Power hybrid technology in the U.S. by 2026. The e-Power system, which is already available in several of Nissan’s global models, offers a different approach to hybrid driving. Unlike traditional hybrids, the e-Power setup uses a gasoline engine solely to generate electricity to charge the battery, while electric motors are responsible for driving the wheels. This setup can provide a more efficient driving experience, as it avoids relying on the gas engine for propulsion.\nAlthough Nissan has not yet confirmed which models will receive the e-Power technology, industry insiders speculate that the 2025 Murano, as well as the smaller Kicks and Rogue SUVs, could be early adopters. The e-Power system could provide a perfect solution for buyers seeking the benefits of electric driving without the need to plug in the vehicle, which would appeal to those still hesitant about fully electric vehicles.\nMoving Toward an Electric Future With Nissan now focusing on both plug-in hybrids and its e-Power hybrid system, the company is positioning itself as a stronger player in the growing hybrid and EV market. The Rogue PHEV will be the first of these efforts to arrive in 2025, followed by more models adopting hybrid technology in the following years. As competition intensifies in the hybrid SUV market, Nissan’s expanded lineup will provide more choices for eco-conscious drivers in the U.S.",

    "title": "Crescita esplosiva dell’agricoltura biologica in Europa: Italia in prima linea",
    "text": "L’agricoltura biologica in Europa ha raggiunto livelli di crescita senza precedenti, evidenziando una tendenza verso pratiche agricole più sostenibili e rispettose dell’ambiente. Nel 2022, la superficie agricola destinata al biologico ha raggiunto i 16,9 milioni di ettari, segnando un notevole incremento del 79% rispetto al 2012, secondo dati Eurostat. Questo aumento significativo riflette un cambiamento sostanziale nelle preferenze dei consumatori, una risposta alle preoccupazioni ambientali globali e un impegno crescente degli agricoltori verso metodi di produzione più naturali. L’Italia è uno dei protagonisti di questa crescita, con un aumento del 101% della sua superficie biologica nello stesso periodo.\nCrescita esplosiva in Europa\nNegli ultimi dieci anni, l’agricoltura biologica in Europa ha registrato una crescita spettacolare, testimoniata da numeri impressionanti. Paesi come la Croazia hanno visto una crescita esponenziale, con le loro superfici biologiche che si sono addirittura quadruplicate. Questo fenomeno è stato accompagnato da un aumento significativo anche in altri paesi chiave dell’Unione Europea: il Portogallo ha segnato un impressionante incremento del 278%, la Bulgaria del 182% e la Francia del 179%.\nL’Italia si è distinta come uno dei protagonisti di questo boom, con una superficie biologica che ha raggiunto i 2,3 milioni di ettari nel 2022. Insieme a Francia, Spagna e Germania, l’Italia rappresenta la maggioranza (56%) delle terre agricole biologiche in Europa. Questi paesi non solo hanno investito in\npolitiche agricole favorevoli e incentivi per la conversione al biologico, ma anche goduto di una crescente domanda da parte dei consumatori per prodotti alimentari sostenibili e di alta qualità: un fenomeno che non è solo una risposta alle pressioni ambientali e alle preoccupazioni per la salute, ma anche un’opportunità economica per gli agricoltori e per l’intera filiera alimentare europea.\nLa crescita dell’agricoltura biologica non è stata omogenea in tutti i paesi dell’UE, ma ha dimostrato un impegno comune verso pratiche agricole più sostenibili e rispettose dell’ambiente, riflettendo un cambiamento culturale e strutturale nel settore agricolo continentale.\nItalia, un esempio di successo\nIn Italia, l’agricoltura biologica ha preso piede grazie a politiche agricole favorevoli e una crescente domanda di prodotti sani e sostenibili. Regioni come Sicilia, Puglia, Calabria e Toscana guidano questa rivoluzione verde, beneficiando di condizioni climatiche ideali e di una\ntradizione agricola profonda che predilige le pratiche biologiche.\nLe regioni italiane hanno sfruttato al meglio le loro risorse naturali e culturali per promuovere l’agricoltura biologica. La\nSicilia, ad esempio, con il suo clima mediterraneo e terreni fertili, è diventata un hub per l’agricoltura biologica, producendo olio d’oliva biologico rinomato in tutto il mondo. La Puglia, con il suo vasto territorio dedicato alla produzione biologica di grano, pomodori e olio, ha visto una crescita significativa delle aziende agricole che abbracciano il biologico per rispondere alla domanda di mercato sempre più esigente.\nLa Calabria, con il suo clima mediterraneo e la varietà di frutta e verdura, ha visto un aumento delle colture biologiche di agrumi e ortaggi. La Toscana, celebre per i suoi vigneti e oliveti, ha abbracciato il biologico come una scelta di qualità e rispetto per la tradizione.\nL’Italia emerge come uno dei paesi leader di questa espansione, registrando un aumento del 101% della superficie agricola biologica tra il 2012 e il 2022. Questa tendenza positiva è il risultato di diversi fattori combinati. Innanzitutto, le politiche agricole nazionali hanno incentivato gli agricoltori a convertire le loro colture verso il biologico attraverso finanziamenti agevolati, supporto tecnico e promozione della certificazione biologica. Queste misure hanno reso più accessibile il passaggio al biologico, riducendo i rischi finanziari e logistici per gli agricoltori.\nInoltre, la crescente domanda di consumatori consapevoli ha giocato un ruolo cruciale. Gli italiani, sempre più attenti alla salute e all’ambiente, preferiscono prodotti biologici per i loro benefici nutrizionali e l’assenza di residui chimici. Questa tendenza è stata amplificata anche dal turismo enogastronomico, con i visitatori che cercano prodotti biologici locali per sperimentare autenticità e sostenibilità.\nObiettivi ambiziosi\nL’UE ha fissato un obiettivo ambizioso di destinare almeno il 25% della sua superficie agricola al biologico entro il 2030, un passo significativo verso una\nagricoltura più sostenibile e rispettosa dell’ambiente. Attualmente, solo il 10,5% della superficie agricola utilizzata è dedicata al biologico, evidenziando la necessità di un aumento sostanziale per raggiungere questo traguardo.\nIl rapido aumento della superficie agricola biologica negli ultimi anni riflette un crescente interesse da parte degli agricoltori e dei consumatori per\npratiche agricole più ecologiche e per prodotti alimentari di alta qualità. Politiche agricole mirate e incentivi governativi hanno giocato un ruolo chiave nel sostenere questa transizione, facilitando la conversione delle terre agricole verso il biologico e promuovendo la sostenibilità ambientale.\nGli agricoltori che considerano la conversione biologica affrontano diversi ostacoli, tra cui la necessità di adattare le loro pratiche agricole, il tempo necessario per la conversione delle terre e la gestione dei costi. In parallelo, educare i consumatori sull’importanza e sui benefici del biologico è fondamentale per stimolare una domanda continua di prodotti biologici. La trasparenza e la tracciabilità nella catena di approvvigionamento, insieme a standard rigorosi di certificazione biologica, sono essenziali per garantire la fiducia dei consumatori e il successo del mercato biologico.\nL’espansione dell’agricoltura biologica non solo può contribuire a migliorare la qualità dei prodotti alimentari, ma anche a ridurre l’impatto ambientale dell’agricoltura convenzionale, promuovendo la conservazione del suolo, la biodiversità e la gestione sostenibile delle risorse idriche.",
