    "title": "Why President Biden's polls aren't good and the three goals he must achieve in the debate to win",
    "text": "In this diary I am going to explain what I believe is the main reason President Biden is struggling in the polls and the three things that he needs to do in the debate for it to be a successful debate that will put him on a trajectory to win the 2024 presidential election. I have said the same thing as Mark Sumner previously, namely that Republicans have been quicker to back Donald Trump than Democrats and independents have been to embrace President Biden, but got pushback from a nontrivial number of active users here. This is the asymmetry that I am talking about. I don't believe that it's the Israel Hamas conflict, not is it the economy or inflation or even price levels. President Biden is where the majority of Americans are. He supports Israel over Hamas and Iran, but he has been concerned about the estate of Palestinian civilians from the beginning and he is opposed to the way that Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has been prosecuting this conflict. Most people here are upset to some degree that President Biden didn't cut off offensive weapons before although Israel remains surrounded by enemies and the risk that a wider war could emerge is not trivial. Therefore, I'm not sure that expecting the president to abandon Israel relatively quickly after a major terrorist attack and after seven decades of close friendship when they remain surrounded by enemies was realistic. In any event, supporting the nation of Israel while opposing how they are engaging in this conflict is undeniably where most Americans are. It's not the economy or inflation. The goal of the Federal Reserve Board for the rate of inflation is two percent. It is now 3.3%, a little over a third of what it was at its peak. Inflation has been lower here than in other similarly situated nations in the G7. Our economy after the pandemic is \"the envy of the world\". The unemployment rate is historically low. More than 15 million jobs have been created since President Biden took office. The unemployment rate has been below four percent for 29 consecutive months. Price levels are significantly higher than they were before the pandemic. However, consumer spending remains strong and more and more Americans recognize that the economy is improving and/or good. I am using good to summarize the economy as a whole while taking higher prices and inflation into account. Outside of higher prices and higher than normal inflation, one would say compared to recent history the economy is outstanding. The reality is that this is a good economy even though the increase in price levels has been hard for many people. When this is reality, then it's difficult to believe that the American people are angry at President Biden over the economy. There is no precedent for seething anger at an American president because of the economy when the economy is actually good. I can't come up with a single example of an incumbent president losing reelection when the unemployment rate is below four percent in more than one hundred years if ever. If you disagree, then give me a counterexample when the unemployment rate was below four percent and the incumbent American president sought reelection and lost. I don't believe that you can give me a single example in the 235 year history of this country. After the state of the Union speech, a number of Democratic Party politicians showed that they were relieved that our president is mentally sharp and healthy. I am an active user here and I didn't believe that President Biden was in significant cognitive decline, but I was relieved that he showed that he was mentally fit. If that's true for me and for Democratic Party politicians, then it's even more true for normal Americans not following politics closely. President Biden has done a very good job as president. However, communication is a serious weakness for him. He was not visible enough and did not sell his accomplishments frequently enough or well enough to reassure voters that he was mentally healthy. Then we add in the uneven coverage of President Biden's gaffes and age and this campaign against him that he is in cognitive decline and his chronological age and inflation and the American people largely began to embrace the view that he is in cognitive decline. He is now much more visible, but the right wing Trumpers have deceptively altered videos of President Biden to reinforce this false narrative because they have absolutely zero morals or ethics. Once people have embraced a view reinforced by media coverage, then it's very very difficult to get them to change that view. That's why President Biden had to get a debate with Donald Trump. I said a while back that what was going to determine if President Biden wins reelection is if he is sufficiently visible and in the public eye enough to reassure those who don't follow politics to show the voters that he is mentally healthy, significantly more so than Donald Trump who actually is in cognitive decline. He had to be out of the public eye to prepare for the debate because of how tricky it is to debate such a prolific liar with no conscience or moral compass. In this debate there should be three goals: (1) President Biden must show that he is mentally healthy (2) While acknowledging that prices are higher and inflation is slightly higher than normal, the economy is good (3) Donald Trump is disqualified as a candidate for president. If President Biden can accomplish this or begin to move the needle on these three truths, then he will go a long way to winning re-election.",

    "text": "La OTAN se sumó hoy a Corea del Sur y Estados Unidos a la hora de denunciar la llegada de soldados norcoreanos a territorio ruso, donde estarían ya entrenando para entrar en combate ante las tropas ucranianas.\nEl presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, defendió hoy el tratado de asistencia militar mutua en caso de agresión suscrito con Corea del Norte , pero no confirmó el despliegue de tropas norcoreanas para su envío a Ucrania, como denuncian Seúl y Estados Unidos.\n“Las imágenes (de satélite) son cosa seria. Si existen esas imágenes, es que algo hay “, afirmó enigmático Putin en la rueda de prensa final de la cumbre del grupo BRICS en la ciudad rusa de Kazán.\nLa OTAN se sumó hoy a Corea del Sur y Estados Unidos a la hora de denunciar la llegada de soldados norcoreanos a territorio ruso , donde estarían ya entrenando para entrar en combate.\nRusia ratifica tratado de asistencia en caso de agresión Sin mencionar en ningún momento la posible presencia de efectivos norcoreanos, Putin destacó que el jueves la Duma o cámara de diputados ratificó el tratado firmado en junio pasado por Moscú y Pionyang . “Nunca hemos dudado ni un ápice de la seriedad con la que los dirigentes norcoreanos se toman nuestros acuerdos”, dijo.\nRusia insistió en que el tratado no incluía artículos secretos y, de hecho, la Duma publicó íntegramente su contenido , incluido el artículo 4 sobre asistencia militar mutua.\n“En caso de que una de las partes sea objeto de una agresión militar por parte de cualquier otro Estado o varios Estados y se encuentre de esa forma en estado de guerra, la otra parte le ofrecerá inmediatamente ayuda militar o de otro tipo por todos los medios a su alcance, en virtud del artículo 51 de la Carta de la ONU y en consonancia con la legislación de la Federación Rusa y la República Popular Democrática de Corea”, señala ese punto.\nEl tratado fue suscrito durante la histórica visita en junio pasado de Putin al régimen ermitaño , la primera que realizaba el jefe del Kremlin en casi un cuarto de siglo.\nEl tratado de “naturaleza defensiva, no está dirigido contra la seguridad de terceros países y tiene como objetivo mantener la estabilidad en la región del Noreste Asiático”, aseguró en la Duma el viceministro de Exteriores Andréi Rudenko, quien añadió que “los tiempos de los tratados secretos quedaron en el pasado”.\nAl gato y al ratón con las tropas norcoreanas Putin no entró en ningún momento al detalle ante las preguntas de un reportero occidental sobre el emplazamiento de tropas norcoreanas . “Qué y cómo lo haremos en el marco de ese artículo es asunto nuestro”, señaló desafiante, tras lo que añadió: “Con nuestros problemas nos las arreglaremos por nosotros mismos”.\nA su vez, admitió que antes de aplicar el artículo 4 será necesario celebrar las correspondientes negociaciones con Pionyan g, que, según Seúl y las cancillerías occidentales, envió en los últimos dos años miles de contenedores con armamento y munición a Rusia para su empleo en Ucrania.\n“Estamos en contacto con nuestros amigos norcoreanos. Veremos cómo se desarrollará esta situación”, aseveró.\nAlgunos analistas y blogueros militares rusos consideran que la incursión ucraniana de agosto pasado en la región fronteriza de Kursk cumpliría con las condiciones expuestas en el tratado ruso-norcoreano.\nDe hecho, según informó hoy la inteligencia militar ucraniana en Telegram, los primeros militares norcoreanos ya habrían llegado al frente en Kursk, aunque Putin insistió hoy en que Moscú está rodeando a las ultimas unidades enemigas en esa región.\nSeúl amenaza con suministrar armas letales a Kiev Mientras, la OTAN confirmó el jueves a EFE el despliegue norcoreano y su portavoz, Farah Dakhlallah, advirtió que su participación en los combates en Ucrania “supondría una escalada significativa en el apoyo de Corea del Norte a la guerra ilegal de Rusia”.\nSeguidamente, el presidente surcoreano, Yoon Suk-yeol, aseguró que Seúl podría plantearse e l envío de más armamento a Ucrania , dependiendo del grado de cooperación militar entre Rusia y Corea del Norte .\nAdemás, prometió que su país no se quedará “de brazos cruzados” , en alusión que hasta ahora se había mantenido fiel al compromiso de no suministrar armamento letal a Kiev.\n“Si Corea del Norte envía fuerzas especiales a la guerra de Ucrania, brindaremos apoyo a Ucrania paso a paso y consideraremos tomar las medidas necesarias para la seguridad de la península de Corea”, afirmó.\nEl Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia (NIS) surcoreano estima que Pionyang ha enviado ya unos 3.000 soldados a territorio ruso .\nLa información llega después de que la semana pasada el propio NIS indicara que preveía el envío de unos 12.000 efectivos en total -una cifra que se aproxima a lo dicho también por Kiev- y que unos 1.500 efectivos ya se encontraban en bases del Lejano Oriente ruso, donde estarían recibiendo instrucción, además de armas, uniformes y cédulas de identidad rusas.",
