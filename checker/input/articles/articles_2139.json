    "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has apologised for the incorrect translation of a 'shloka' from the Bhagavad Gita which had created a row. Mr Sarma's post on X had landed him in the crosshairs of the Opposition with several leaders accusing him of promoting caste divisions. In his apology, Mr Sarma said that the verse had been posted on his X account by his team to keep up his tradition of sharing one Gita 'shloka' daily with his followers. \"As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation,\" Mr Sarma said on Thursday. The BJP leader said he deleted the tweet as soon as he noticed the mistake. \"As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,\" he said. As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas.\nRecently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation.\nAs soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly… The post which sparked a political row had incorrectly said that according to the Gita, it is the duty of the Shudras to serve the other three castes - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi had launched a sharp attack on Mr Sarma saying that he was not fulfilling his oath of treating every Indian citizen equally. \"In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras.” Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It's reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam's Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,\" Mr Owaisi said on X (formerly Twitter). In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras.”\nHolding a constitutional position, your oath… Himanta Sarma in his apology post also said that Assam was the picture of a casteless society and the incorrect translation was a mistake.",

Former quarterback Caleb Williams’ No. 13 also joined the ranks of the retired numbers.\n👀🏟️✌️\n[@ReggieBush] [@CALEBcsw] [pic.twitter.com/coU94a7eUg]\n— USC Football ✌️ (@uscfb)\n[September 5, 2024]\nBoth Bush and Williams won Heisman Trophies with USC, so the decisions were a no-brainer. Bush’s, however, is long overdue. He won his Heisman in 2005, but a lengthy investigation found that he had accepted improper benefits while playing for the school. That led to the program being stripped of 14 victories and Bush’s Heisman being vacated, and a forced dissociation between Bush and USC. Bush\nfinally had his Heisman returned to him in April, partly in recognition of how much NIL rights have changed the college football landscape.\nBush remains one of the most iconic players in USC history, regardless of the penalties that had been levied against him. USC probably wishes it could have honored him this way even sooner than they did.",

    "title": "Lipromo retoma el proyecto para construir cien viviendas en su segunda finca de A Maestranza - La Opinión de A Coruña",
    "text": "El proyecto inmobiliario puesto en marcha en dos de las antiguas parcelas del Ministerio de Defensa en la zona de A Maestranza da un paso adelante más con la presentación, por la empresa vasca Lipromo, del estudio de detalle para la finca que carecía hasta ahora de este documento, en el que se fijan los volúmenes que se podrán construir. La edificabilidad autorizada en esa parcela permite edificar en torno a un centenar de viviendas, aunque será el estudio ahora en tramitación el que defina su número exacto, así como la altura del edificio. Ese terreno es uno de los tres de A Maestranza que pertenecían a Defensa y que tras perder su uso militar fueron utilizados como aparcamiento por los vecinos de la Ciudad Vieja. En 2016 el ministerio valló las tres fincas y anunció su subasta, aunque el hallazgo de restos arqueológicos en ellas hizo que no se presentasen ofertas y que finalmente tuviese que recurrir a una venta directa. La alta probabilidad de que en la finca número 3, adosada a la Sociedad Deportiva Hípica, halla vestigios con valor histórico, hizo que Defensa finalmente no la vendiese y que Lipromo adquiriese las otras dos por 11,9 millones en diciembre de 2019. Tras la compra, la inmobiliaria presentó un estudio de detalle conjunto para las dos parcelas, pero la advertencia de la Xunta de que podría haber restos arqueológicos la animó a retirarlo y a efectuar nuevas prospecciones en el terreno. Aunque no se ha hecho público el resultado de esos trabajos, la decisión de la compañía de volver a presentar un estudio de detalle apunta a que finalmente recibió autorización de la Dirección Xeral de Patrimonio para continuar la tramitación de este proyecto. La denominada parcela 1 se encuentra emplazada entre la avenida del Metrosidero y la calle Maestranza, con uno de sus extremos próximos al edificio del rectorado. La número 2 ya cuenta con su estudio de detalle aprobado por el pleno el pasado diciembre, aunque fue recurrido por la Comisión Aberta en Defensa do Común en el Tribunal Superior de Xustiza de Galicia, que admitió a trámite el recurso el pasado mes de abril. Defensa do Común, que reclama el mantenimiento del carácter público de esta y otras propiedades de las administraciones, argumentó que los terrenos adquiridos por Lipromo son “espacios públicos” y que su venta “encierra una operación meramente especulativa y mercantilista”. El estudio de detalle de la parcela 2, situada entre la avenida del Metrosidero y la residencia militar de Atocha, prevé la construcción de un edificio con bajo y cinco alturas en el que se distribuyan 56 viviendas, todas ellas de precio libre, por lo que su ubicación hace prever que su valor en el mercado sea muy elevado. A pesar de la luz verde que recibió de Patrimonio para edificar en esta finca, la empresa deberá realizar todos los movimientos de tierras con control arqueológico y si aparecen restos “podrán modificarse las condiciones de la autorización de las obras”, según le advirtió el organismo autonómico. El edificio ocupará la mayor parte de la parcela y se unirá en uno de sus extremos a otro en forma de U cuya fachada principal mira al cuartel de Atocha. En esa misma zona se retranqueará cuatro metros con respecto a la Residencia Militar de la calle Maestranza para atender una reclamación de Defensa. La tercera de las parcelas de A Maestranza, que aún permanece en manos del Ministerio de Defensa, fue una de las que son propiedad de ese organismo y que el Gobierno central incluyó en el lote de las que serían cedidas a los ayuntamientos para la construcción de viviendas destinadas al alquiler asequible tras su compra por la Entidad Pública de Suelos (Sepes). Aunque dos semanas antes de la celebración de las elecciones municipales de mayo de 2023, el Gobierno local anunció que el Estado construiría 88 viviendas sociales entre esta parcela de A Maestranza y la que Defensa también posee en la calle Adelaida Muro, el ministerio informó el pasado diciembre a este periódico que la venta de esos terrenos a la Sepes “no tiene calendario previsto”, sin que desde entonces se haya hecho ninguna comunicación sobre esa iniciativa. La información que se proporcionó a mediados del año pasado detallaba que la finca de la Ciudad Vieja albergaría un edificio con 77 viviendas, mientras que en la de Adelaida Muro se levantaría un inmueble con 11 viviendas.",
