    "title": "Jack Nicklaus still earning roars ahead of Hoag Classic in Newport Beach",
    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH – Jack Nicklaus, arguably the greatest golfer of all time, knows how to make a ballroom full of avid golfers — weekend hackers and country club members alike — feel better about their game.\nAs the featured speaker at the annual Hoag Classic community breakfast on Tuesday at Balboa Bay Club, Nicklaus casually mentioned the state of his golf game these days. The winner of a record 18 major championships and 120 tournaments around the world said he has played one round this year. Keep in mind that he turned 85 in January.\n“I played in the father-son (event) at The Bear’s Club, because my grandkids wanted to play,” Nicklaus said, referring to his family’s exclusive private club that he designed in Jupiter, Fla., not far from his longtime home in West Palm Beach. “So, they gave me a 14 handicap, and I shot 91. That’s about what I shoot.”\nThere you go. Feel better now?\nThere’s more. At a charity fundraiser called “The Jake” that was named after a 17-month-old grandson he lost in a drowning accident years ago, Nicklaus “came out of retirement” last winter to auction off a round of golf with him “at a golf course of my choice.”\nTo make a long story short, the bidding started at $500,000, and Nicklaus eventually agreed to play with three groups at $700,000 apiece.\n“The course of my choice ended up being Augusta (National),” Nicklaus revealed, “so I took these three groups to Augusta, three days in a row in April last year (after The Masters). I shot 88, 90 and 91 – that’s my game now. And you know what? I never hit an iron to (reach) a par-3, par-4 or par-5; that’s how far I hit it now.\n“Anyway, I had a great time, and we raised a lot of money for our foundation – about $4.8 million for one event. Pretty good. I’m proud of that.”\nThat elicited one of many thunderous ovations from the audience of 500 who shelled out $5,000 for a table to hear “The Golden Bear” tell stories, this time benefiting the Hoag Orthopedic Institute. And Nicklaus clearly loves hospital charities, because he and his wife Barbara have raised more than $200 million for the Nicklaus Children’s Health Care Foundation over the past 20 years.\nNicklaus seems to enjoy reciting those numbers even more than the numbers that have made him one of the most famous athletes in sports history and earned him Sports Illustrated’s distinction as the “Individual Male Athlete of the 20th Century” and one of the “10 Greatest Athletes of the Century” by ESPN.\nPerhaps that helps explain why he also received a standing ovation Tuesday when he announced, midway through his Q&A: “I’m embarrassed, but I need to use the little boys room. Give me two minutes, and I’ll be right back.” (This also led to a ballroom stampede by dozens who felt a similar urge, or merely wanted to emulate Nicklaus.)\nUpon his return, Nicklaus did tell a few golf stories to entertain the audience, and suffice to say he has a zero handicap when remembering the details of tournaments he played in 60 years ago. He remembered his first check as a professional, the season-opening 1962 LA Open at Rancho Park. “Hauled in a big check of $333.33 for tying for 50th place,” he quipped, adding that he made $440 at Torrey Pines, $330 at Pebble Beach, $256 at Palm Springs and $3,200 for second place in Phoenix.\nThe 1962 Phoenix Open also was memorable to him, because he played in the last group with Arnold Palmer, then the world’s most popular and successful pro golfer and 10 years older than Jack. “We walked off the 17th green, and Arnie says, ‘If you birdie the last hole, you can finish second, if you play it smart. That was a really nice gesture. So, I birdied the last hole and finished second – and he won by 12 shots!”\nLater that year, in his 17th pro tournament, Nicklaus won his first of 73 PGA Tour titles, beating Palmer in an 18-hole playoff to win the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania, essentially in Arnie’s backyard, where everyone was loudly cheering for Palmer and against Nicklaus.\n“I didn’t mind it; I was a young kid with blinders on,” Nicklaus recalled. “I didn’t hear anything.” That, however, was not the case in the gallery, where fiery Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes was walking with Jack’s father. “My dad had to restrain Woody,” Nicklaus added, smirking.\nNaturally, the conversation eventually turned to Nicklaus’ victory for the ages — or was it for the aged? — at the 1986 Masters, where he won the last of his 18 majors at age 46. All the details are still fresh in his mind, hole by hole, shot by shot. He shot 74 in the first round, 71 in the second round, 69 in the third round.\n“Sunday morning, I looked at the leaderboard, and I was four shots behind with eight guys ahead of me,” he recalled. When his son, Steve, called that day, he asked, “Pops, what do you think it will take today?” Jack answered: “I think 66 will tie; 65 will win.”\nBut Nicklaus, in his own words, said, “I screwed up the front nine,” missing two short putts and treading water at even par through eight holes.\nAs he lined up a birdie putt on No. 9, a roar from behind him, at the eighth green, startled him. Then came another roar. Turned out, Seve Ballesteros and Tom Kite had both holed third-shot pitch shots for eagle.\n“I knew what had happened,” Nicklaus recalled Tuesday. “I turned to the gallery and said, ‘They made some noise; let’s see if we can make some noise here. I made the birdie putt, and the crowd loved it.”\nBut Nicklaus didn’t think he had a chance at that point. “It made me 1-under – 9,000 shots behind,” he said.\nBut that was before he played the back nine in 6-under: birdie at No. 10, birdie at No.11, bogey at No. 12, birdie at No. 13, eagle at No. 15, birdie at No. 16, birdie at 17 en route to a record-tying back-nine 30 and 7-under 65, to finish at 9-under for the tournament. He recited his shots and distances on every hole.\nThen he went to Butler Cabin, plopped down on the couch and watched as Kite missed a birdie putt on No. 18 and and Greg Norman bogied No. 18 after making five birdies in a row. Nicklaus was a Masters champion again – after the greatest comeback of his career.\n“I gave my son a hug,” he said, referring to his caddie Jackie. “That’s what I remember most.”\nAnother ovation in the ballroom. Jack Nicklaus is still a closer, at age 85, even if he doesn’t shoot his age.\nRelated Articles\nGolf | Rory McIlroy tops J.J. Spaun in playoff to win The Players Championship Golf | San Dimas’ J.J.

    "title": "New Idaho law protects adoption, foster care agencies against religious discrimination by state - LifeSite",
    "text": "BOISE, Idaho ( LifeSiteNews ) – Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a new law Monday forbidding state agencies from discriminating against adoption and foster agencies on the basis of religion in a move hailed by supporters as ensuring the needs of children take precedence over left-wing ideology. HB 578 declares that the Idaho Legislature believes children who need new homes “benefit from having as many adoption and foster parent agencies as possible because the more agencies that take part in these services, the greater the likelihood that a child will find a permanent placement,” and that faith-based organizations “have a lengthy and distinguished history of providing adoption and foster care services in this state.” Accordingly, the law forbids state and local governmental entities from any kind of “discriminatory action,” including but not limited to benefit denial, tax penalties, and hiring or promotion decisions, “wholly or partially on the basis” of providing or declining services “based on or in a manner consistent with a sincerely held religious belief.” It takes effect on July 1. “Every child deserves a loving home that can provide them stability and opportunities to grow,” Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Greg Chafuen responded . “Faith-based adoption and foster care providers have served children looking for loving homes for centuries while living out their sincerely held religious beliefs. Yet, in states like Oregon, children have been denied safety and care because government officials have chosen to put politics over people. The sad reality is that when the government can discriminate against people of faith, vulnerable children suffer.” “We applaud Idaho for prioritizing the well-being of kids by prohibiting state and local government officials from discriminating against adoption and foster care providers and parents simply because of their religious beliefs and moral convictions,” Chafuen continued. “This law helps children benefit from as many adoption and foster care agencies as possible, faith- and non-faith-based alike.” A substantial amount of social science literature supports the conviction that children are best served by homes with both a mother and a father, as each sex tends to bring unique strengths and emphases to parenting, which complement one another; and gives children a positive role model of their own sex as well as helping them understand and relate to the opposite sex. By contrast, a homosexual male couple would by definition lack a mother, and a lesbian couple would be unable to provide a father. Similarly, a significant body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them. Studies find that more than 80% of children experiencing gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence , whereas reinforcing dysphoria often fails to resolve and may even exacerbate mental strife by perpetuating delusion and neglecting the actual root causes. Yet in other states such as Washington and Arizona , officials have enacted rules that threaten to put religious agencies out of business if they do not fully embrace pro-LGBT dogma despite not only the potential harm to children but shortages in available foster homes. Nationally, the Biden administration has proposed requiring adoption and foster agencies to ensure that children who “identify” as LGBT are placed in homes that “facilitate the child’s access to age-appropriate resources, services, and activities that support” LGBT activists’ conception of “health and well-being.”",

    "text": "Aunque Apple Intelligence es la absoluta protagonista de iOS 18.1 , la nueva versión del sistema operativo para el iPhone incluye otras funciones dignas de mención por su utilidad. Algunas de estas, incluso, ni siquiera la compañía las menciona. Es el ejemplo de esta medida de seguridad que llegó a los modelos compatibles tras la actualización en septiembre, y que ha sido descubierta gracias a investigadores de seguridad.\nSegún informa TechCrunch , estos han comprobado que, con iOS 18.1, el iPhone es capaz de reiniciarse automáticamente cuando detecta 72 horas de inactividad . Esto hace que cualquier persona que intente acceder a ese iPhone, lo tenga más complicado por un motivo en particular.\nCuando el iPhone con iOS 18.1 se reinicia, es más complicado acceder o desbloquear el iPhone por terceros , ya sean las fuerzas de seguridad o hackers. Esto se debe a que el dispositivo tiene diferentes fases de desbloqueo; y la más frágil es cuando el iPhone ya se ha encendido y el usuario ya ha introducido el código previamente.\nCon el reinicio, el iPhone entra en un estado de “Antes del primer desbloqueo”, donde todos los datos que se almacenan e stán completamente encriptados . Por lo que es mucho más complicado acceder a la información personal del usuario, incluso utilizando herramientas externas.\nQué tiene que pasar para que el iPhone se reinicie solo en iOS 18.1 En cualquier caso, para que el iPhone se reinicie, es necesario que se cumplan una serie de condiciones. En primer lugar, el iPhone tiene que estar bloqueado; es decir, haber superado los intentos de Face ID y Touch ID. Además, solo se reinicia transcurridos los tres días desde el bloqueo. Para evitar que se reinicie , simplemente debes desbloquear o usar el dispositivo con normalidad cada tres días.\nCuriosamente, en iOS 18, esta medida de seguridad estaba programado para un periodo de inactividad de siete días. Apple, sin embargo, la redujo a tres días en iOS 18.1 . La compañía por el momento no ha ofrecido más detalles al respecto, y no parece haber una opción para desactivar esta característica en los ajustes del sistema.\nEso sí, las fuerzas de seguridad todavía pueden hacer uso de herramientas externas para intentar acceder a la información de los dispositivos bloqueados. No obstante, la nueva función de iOS 18.1, hacen que acceder a estos datos sea algo más complicado.",

He knew each and every one of his passengers on a first-name basis, always greeting them with a smile, and became the \"mainstay in his community.\" “Anyone who's driven a bus can tell you it is hard work. Mr. Dumas does it with a smile and a sense of pride that makes his customers and all who cross his path feel uplifted and inspired,\" MARTA General Manager and CEO Collie Greenwood previously said. Dumas first joined MARTA in 1972 as a bus driver running the routes of west Atlanta over the year before most recently driving for the West Lake Station on the BlueLine. The Adamsville native has carried approximately 2.8 million passengers since he began operating buses. He also boasts a spotless driving record, having driven over two million miles without an accident, the transit center said. MARTA said he will continue to train new drivers as a consultant after his retirement in November. He will officially start his consultant position in January. After mentoring countless drivers over the decades, the new role is only fitting. He will also continue to lead the mentorship program out of the Perry bus facility before his retirement. “Mr. Dumas is a consummate professional and one of the most loyal and generous people you’ll ever meet,” Greenwood said. “I thank him for his incredible dedication and service and celebrate all he’s done for MARTA and for the countless customers he’s moved through metro Atlanta over the past 51 years. I am delighted he will continue as a mentor for the next generation of operators.” After celebrating 50 years of Dumas' service, MARTA surprised him with a bus- with his picture on it and a special minibus to go along with it. They also honored him with digital billboards celebrating his service all around metro Atlanta. Atlanta City Council members at a November meeting decided to dedicate and celebrate Dumas' retirement by proclaiming Nov. 15, 2023, to be the Coy Dumas Jr. Appreciation Day in Fulton County.

Some areas could see more than 3 inches.\nThe weather service has issued a flood watch for 8 a.m. Saturday through 8 a.m. Sunday, saying, \"Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\"\nMore: First day of spring brings warm temps, but don't put away that parka\nWhich rivers are likely to flood? River flooding is \"more than likely,\" with an 80% chance of minor flooding and a 40% chance of moderate flooding at the Pawtuxet River at Cranston, the weather service says.\nThe Wood River at Hope is \"another area to watch,\" with an 85% chance of minor flooding and a 50% chance of moderate flooding, the weather service says.\nAlso expect gusty winds Saturday night into Sunday morning, the weather service says.\nThe rain should end quickly on Sunday morning, possibly before dawn, and the day will be partly sunny and breezy with a high near 42 in Providence, the weather service says.",

    "title": "Urlaub auf Mallorca: Extra-Kosten wegen strengeren Kontrollen am Flughafen - DerWesten.de",
    "text": "Ryanair-Flüge von und nach Mallorca stehen derzeit besonders im Fokus. Immer wieder gibt es Berichte über Probleme am Gate, vor allem bei der Kontrolle des Handgepäcks. Dass Billigflieger strenge Regeln haben, ist bekannt. Doch die Willkür, mit der diese durch das Personal durchgesetzt werden, stößt auf Empörung und massiven Ärger. Immer wieder berichten Deutsche, dass sie besonders von Mallorca kommend unter der Durchsetzung der strengen Regeln leiden würden. Nicht nur die Zeit der Mallorca-Urlauber, sondern vor allem auch das Portemonnaie betrifft das, doch meist ist das vermeidbar.\nEinem deutschen Paar passierte zum Beispiel Folgendes: Es wollte mit seinem Sohn von Palma de Mallorca nach Mailand-Malpensa fliegen, wo ein weiteres Familienmitglied auf sie wartete. Doch die Reise endete abrupt am Gate. Beim Boarding sollten die Handgepäckstücke in die vorgesehenen Rahmen gestellt werden. Das Ergebnis: Die Maße wurden minimal überschritten. „Im Endeffekt waren es zehn Millimeter, die zu viel waren.“ Und das, obwohl sie mit denselben Koffern schon häufiger mit Ryanair geflogen waren.\nDie Familie durfte ihren Flug nicht antreten\nDie Crew verlangte daraufhin von den drei Reisenden 90 Euro pro Gepäckstück. Ein Gespräch mit einem Vorgesetzten wurde abgelehnt. Die Situation eskalierte, andere Fluggäste mischten sich ein. Trotzdem blieb die Crew bei ihrer Entscheidung. Als der Familienvater schließlich bereit war, die Gebühr zu zahlen, kam die endgültige Absage: „Ich habe entschieden, dass Sie heute nicht mehr fliegen werden“, zitiert MZ den Gate-Agent. Die Familie wurde zurückgelassen.\n+++ Ich war auf der größten Kirmes Mallorcas – und wurde bitter enttäuscht +++\nRyanair bestätigt den Mallorca-Vorfall. Die Gebührenforderung sei „richtigerweise“ erfolgt. Außerdem wirft Ryanair den Passagieren aggressives Verhalten vor und rechtfertigt damit die Verweigerung des Fluges, berichtet MZ. Der Fall sorgt auch online für Diskussionen. „Wer mit Ryanair fliegt, ist selber schuld“, findet ein Facebook-Nutzer. Auch das grundsätzliche Geschäftsmodell der Airline wird infrage gestellt: „90 Euro für 10 Millimeter ist einfach nur Schikane und unverschämt“. Ein Nutzer glaubt eine Lösung zu haben: „Hartschalen-Trolleys sind Mist. Da ist alles endgültig.“\nAndere verstehen die Aufregung nicht: „Die strengen Gepäckregeln von Ryanair sollten doch nun eigentlich mittlerweile bekannt sein“. Ryanair-Sprecher der DACH-Region, Marcel Pouchain Meyer gibt gegenüber MZ dieser Meinung recht, die Maße seien nun einmal vorgegeben, meint er. Und: „Wenn das Gepäckstück dann ein oder zwei Zentimeter übersteht, kann ich nur empfehlen, die Jacke aus dem Rucksack zu holen und sicherzustellen, dass das Gepäckstück irgendwie hineinpasst“. Die Strenge der Umsetzung liege jedoch jeweils in der Hand des Gate-Agents vor Ort.\nMallorca: Unverschuldet gestrandet mit Ryanair\nEinem anderen deutschen Paar passierte es, dass es trotz pünktlichen Erscheinens einfach nicht mit auf den Flug von Palma de Mallorca nach Nürnberg gelassen wurde. Bei ihm gab es laut MZ nicht einmal die Begründung aufgrund Nicht-Einhaltung etwaiger Regeln der Fluggesellschaft. Der Flug sei einfach voll gewesen. Vor ihnen habe es massive Diskussionen mit Passagieren, die zu große Gepäckstücke dabei hatten, gegeben. Als diese vorbei waren und die Deutschen ihre Boardkarten vorzeigen und einsteigen wollten, seien sie ignoriert worden und man habe ihnen mitgeteilt, dass der Flug geschlossen sei.\nMehr News:\nEgal mit welcher Fluggesellschaft, wer mit Handgepäck in den Mallorca-Urlaub fliegt, sollte sich mit den Handgepäcksbestimmungen rechtzeitig auseinandersetzen. Wenn man mit mehreren Airlines seine Reise bestreitet, dann besser mit allen von ihnen. Aufgrund der Erfahrungen des Paares, das einfach stehen gelassen wurde, kann man sich jedoch selbst dann leider nicht immer sicher sein.",

    "text": "Police officer in Ohio on administrative leave after punching Miami University football player during arrest\nBy Jamiel Lynch, CNN\n(CNN) — An Oxford, Ohio, police officer seen punching a Miami University football player during a November arrest outside a local bar has been placed on administrative leave during an investigation, police say.\nThe student, identified by family as Devin Johnson, entered Brick Street bar through an exit-only gate, pushing past a female employee on November 18, according to a Facebook\npost by Oxford police.\nWhen the manager of the bar confronted Johnson, he was assaulted, according to police. Johnson then refused to leave the bar and an altercation occurred outside the establishment, the post said.\n“When the officer arrived at the scene, he observed the individual resisting and he was unable to complete the arrest until additional officers were able to assist in getting him into handcuffs,” the post added.\nCNN has reached out to police for the incident report and additional comment.\nJohnson, a 20-year-old defensive back for the Miami RedHawks, was arrested and charged with resisting arrest, assault, criminal trespass and underage intoxication. Johnson has pleaded not guilty to the charges, his attorney told CNN. His case has been set for trial in February, according to court records.\nIn surveillance video circulating on social media, Johnson can be seen outside the bar with several other people. Johnson and one of the men are seen struggling and Johnson is pinned on the ground by at least three people before police arrive.\nAn officer arrives on scene as the people have Johnson on the ground. The officer can be seen attempting to hold Johnson on the ground and appears to punch him three times. They continue to hold Johnson down as another officer arrives on scene. Both officers can be seen forcibly holding Johnson’s head, one of them pulling him by the hair at one point, before placing handcuffs on him.\nJohnson’s attorney, Ryan Agee, called the video “deeply disturbing” in a statement to the\nMiami Student earlier this week.\nIn a Thursday statement to CNN, Agee said, “To date, there has been a concerning lack of communication from the Oxford City Police Department and those conducting the use of force investigation. Given the department’s public statements post-incident and their seeming oversight of critical details, we firmly believe that an independent, external investigation is not only justified but essential to uphold the trust and confidence of the community and the Johnson family in the investigative process.”\nAddressing the video in a\nFacebook post on Monday, Oxford police said their initial investigation “did not include this video angle.”\nThe officer involved in the incident, Matthew Blauvelt, is on paid administrative leave during the investigation, according to Oxford Police Chief John Jones. CNN was unable to reach Blauvelt for comment.\nA statement from\nMiami University said it was aware of the “disturbing video” and had reached out to the student. The university has also “contacted the City of Oxford to learn more about this incident and to express our deep concerns about what occurred,” it said.\nMayor William Snavely said in a statement to CNN, “This is a very unusual and unfortunate event for Oxford. Clearly, the City does not condone excessive use of force. The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave and a full investigation is underway. We intend for that investigation to be fair, transparent, and concluded as soon as possible.”\nWhen reached for comment on the incident, a representative from Brick Street said they did not have a comment at this time.\nIn a Tuesday\nInstagram post, the establishment said, in part, “The video is disturbing, especially for Devin and family members. We are grateful that Devin and our crowd manager did not require any medical attention and that Devin was released at the police station shortly after the incident. Regardless, it does not change the fact that this portion of the video is disturbing and has evoked emotions.”\n“We look forward to an opportunity to meet with Devin after the break. These situations can happen in seconds when emotions are high and quickly spiral. Good people can get caught in the middle of unfortunately (sic) circumstances,” it added.\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "EV sales up 20% across Europe in February",
    "text": "Electric vehicle (EV) sales have increased by 20% across Europe so far this year, according to new data from Rho Motion.\nThe EV research house looked at wider global trends for EV sales, which saw markets like China increase EV sales by 35%, while markets like the US and Canada saw a similar 20% increase to Europe.\nBattery Eeectric vehicles (BEVs) have taken the lion’s share of this growth at 29% year-to-date, with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) modestly growing at 2%.\nMost European markets are up YTD, with the exception of France which remains down due to the introduction of a weight tax on PHEVs which began in January 2025 which has led to a decrease in PHEVs by 48% YTD.\nHowever, BEV sales in France are now up by 1% YTD.\nThe German and UK BEV market continues strong sales with both over 40% YTD.\nThe EU Commission has proposed flexibility for car and van manufacturers meeting CO2 standards.\nThe flexibility would allow these manufacturers to meet these targets by averaging performance over three years, helping prevent large fines that several car manufacturers were expected to face.\nCharles Lester, Rho Motion data manager, said: “It’s been a solid start to the year for EV sales globally with a 50% bump in February compared to the previous year.\n“Much of the growth continues to come from China which is seeing a pure electric renaissance this year compared to the hybrid love affair of 2024.\n“France’s weight tax on plug-in hybrids has had a big impact on those vehicle sales which are down almost 50% so far this year.\n“Manufacturers might be relieved that the EU has introduced flexibility into the emissions standards, but they will still need to put their foot to the pedal to avoid large fines.\n“As for North America, the region is seeing steady growth of 20% so far this year.\n\"American drivers bought 30% more electric vehicles than they had by this time last year, making use of the final months of IRA tax breaks before the incentives are expected to be pulled later this year.”",
