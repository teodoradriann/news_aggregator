    "text": "Inglaterra. – La modelo de Playboy y novia del futbolista italiano Mario Balotelli, Tabby Brown, murió pocos días después de llegar a su casa en Inglaterra desde República Dominicana, donde se sometió a una liposucción y levantamiento de glúteos (BBL), según reveló Daily Mail.\nBrown, quien también posó para las revistas Cosmopolitan y Elle, fue declarada muerta el 13 de octubre de 2023, pero fue esta semana cuando se publicó la causa oficial de su deceso: embolia grasa.\nEl Tribunal Forense del Sur de Londres explicó que los informes toxicológicos dieron negativo en pruebas de alcohol y drogas, pero sus pulmones tenían “numerosos glóbulos pequeños de grasa”.\nDe acuerdo con medios internacionales, una operación estética en Reino Unido puede costar entre 3,000 y 8,500 libras esterlinas, mientras que en República Dominicana la competencia que existe entre clínicas y cirujanos hace que los precios estén a la mitad de lo que son en Gran Bretaña.\nTabby nació en la religión musulmana. Su funeral tuvo lugar en la Mezquita Central de Londres en Regent’s Park y sus restos fueron sepultados en un cementerio musulmán en Ilford.\nRecibe las últimas noticias en tu casilla de email",

    "title": "Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Madison hit by fire",
    "text": "Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Downtown Madison was damaged by fire Friday morning after its steeple was apparently struck by lightning.\nThe first call about a fire at the historic church, at 120 W. Johnson St., came in at 11:17 a.m., about 10 minutes after witnesses reported hearing an extraordinarily loud boom in the area, likely from a lightning strike, Madison Fire Department spokesperson Cynthia Schuster said.\nMadison firefighters battle a blaze Friday in the steeple of Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Madison. The fire, which was confined to the steeple, was likely ignited by a lightning strike, according to witnesses who reported a large boom about 10 minutes before flames appeared.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL When firefighters arrived four minutes later, Schuster said, flames could be seeing coming from around the clock in the front of the steeple.\nFirefighters attacked the fire from inside the church and from ladder trucks outside. By 11:30, witnesses could see smoke still spilling from the steeple but no flames as firefighters cut a hole in the base of the steeple and then hit it with a high-pressure hose, peeling back many of the copper shingles. The fire was fully extinguished at 12:29, Schuster said.\n “The steeple has intricate construction within it, which made it a challenge for firefighters to fully get to the source,” she said.\nBystanders watch as firefighters try to save the steeple of Holy Redeemer Catholic Church.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL Two people, including a cleaner, were inside the church at the time but were unaware of the fire, she said. No injuries were reported.\nThe Rev. Drew Olson, the parish priest, said he was at St. James Catholic School on the Near West Side when he heard the news.\nA volunteer at the school had shown him a picture of a steeple on fire. At first, he said, he thought he was looking at an old picture of St. Raphael Cathedral, the former seat of the Madison Catholic Diocese that was destroyed in an arson fire 19 years ago .\n“At first I was like, ‘Why are you showing me this?’” he said. “I thought it was St. Raphael’s at first, just because what other church in downtown Madison has smoke around the top of it?”\nBut quickly realizing it was Holy Redeemer after a flood of phone calls and messages from parishioners, Olson said he rushed to the church with one main mission: to save the Blessed Sacrament.\nBy the time he arrived, firefighters were already inside the building, and the Blessed Sacrament had already been removed.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\nThe Rev. Drew Olson, priest at Holy Redeemer Catholic Church, said damage appeared isolated to the steeple, \"so that's a huge relief.\"\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL “It was all isolated to the tower, so that’s a huge relief,” Olson said of the blaze.\nLater Friday, the Diocese of Madison said the fire never managed to spread beyond the upper portion of the steeple, but minor smoke damage occurred throughout the building. Additionally, the large amount of water used to extinguish the fire caused damage to the “back third of the church,” which will require significant cleanup.\nCopper shingles are peeled back after firefighters hit the steeple with a high-pressure hose.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL “Hearing of a church fire in downtown Madison brings back difficult memories for many of us,” Bishop Donald Hying said Friday. “I am grateful that no one was injured and extend my deepest appreciation to the Madison Fire Department.”\nHoly Redeemer is the oldest active Catholic church in the city after St. Raphael Cathedral burned in 2005. It was designated a historic landmark by the city in 1983.\nThe church was founded in 1857 to serve Madison’s German-speaking Catholic population, according to the parish website , which describes Holy Redeemer as the “the most traditionally decorated church in the city.” Most of the city’s German-speaking Catholic residents lived near the West Johnson Street site when the original church was built.\nThe sandstone church, built in 1865, is the oldest Catholic parish in Madison.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL That building was replaced by the existing church in the late 1860s, according to a Landmarks Commission historical marker . The first steeple was “greatly damaged by a heavy storm” in 1873, according to a timeline published by The Capital Times nearly a century ago.\nThe steeple was rebuilt in 1880, and the four-faced clock — a gift from a member of the congregation — was added in 1881. At least one of the clock faces appeared to be damaged by Friday’s blaze.\nPrayers and Sunday services will be suspended until the building can be repaired, Olson said. Masses, liturgies and other activities that would normally be at Holy Redeemer will be moved to other diocesan churches until a safety assessment can be made.\nState Journal reporter Nicole Pollack contributed to this report.\nWith its narrow passages, locked doors, bells and other infrastructure, the steeple presented a challenge for Madison firefighters, spokesperson Cynthia Schuster said.\nJOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL The transformation of St. Bernard into Madison's cathedral is well underway\n9 more dugout canoes found in Lake Mendota; 1 may be 4,500 years old\nPine Street Oak, one of Madison's oldest trees, falls to storms\nThe church was founded in 1857 to serve Madison’s German-speaking Catholic population, according to the parish website .",

    "text": " Scientists continue to conduct regular tests of the waters off Lahaina and say last week’s storm dumped more than 4 inches of rain.\n“It wasn’t a humungous storm, but it was certainly the biggest storm since the fire,” said Chris Shuler, UH-Manoa hydrologist at the Water Resources Research Center.\nSpecial Section: Maui Wildfires Disaster “The fact that it’s falling on a highly impacted burned area really drives concerns that there’s not only ash and contaminants mobilizing, but there is definitely mobilizing sediment,” he added.\nConfirmed test results aren’t available yet, but environmentalists say there are some encouraging signs. “There’s no doubt that toxicity has flowed into the ocean, but I think all the work that has been done has really reduced the amount that could have washed right in,” said Liz Yannell, program manager at Hui O Ka Wai Ola. “Soiltac must have kept the ash in place,” she added.\nExperts even saw a monk seal that came to rest on shore.\n“We’ve seen a lot of life more recently which warms your heart when you are out there,” said Yannell.\nAlso encouragingly, that burned chemical stench is gone and the landscape is being prepared for another change as the historic Pioneer Mill Smoke Stack remains standing above it all.\nBut residents say some things will never return.\nCounty: Lahaina wildfire debris to be wrapped in plastic before transfer to landfill\nSanford Hill, who lost his home at a senior living complex in Lahaina, recently returned to the community for the first time.\n“All the memories that I have going back 50 years of that place are gone,” said Hill.\nHe remembers Halloween parties during 70s and the home of Fleetwood’s on Front Street, but now the businesses and cottages by the sea just remnant memories.\n“No matter how they rebuild it, they are not going to capture what I remember ... because it’s just gone,” said Hill. “I don’t think they are ever be able to capture the character of Lahaina again.”\nCopyright 2024 ",

    "title": "Barcelona: Ronald Araújo renueva su contrato hasta 2031 - ESPN",
    "text": "Relacionado con la Juventus o la Premier League, Araújo acordó su continuidad con el Barcelona al extender el contrato que acababa en 2026 hasta 2031\nBARCELONA -- Ronald Araújo seguirá en el Barcelona hasta 2031, después de acordar sus representantes con el club la renovación de su contrato que acababa el 30 de junio de 2026 por cinco años más, anunció el club azulgrana.\nAraújo, que cumplirá 26 años en marzo, se planteó durante los últimos meses una salida, sospechando que perdía trascendencia en el Barcelona (a pesar de ser capitán) tanto por el impacto de Pau Cubarsí como por el excelente papel de Iñigo Martínez a su lado en el centro de la zaga y el papel de Jules Koundé en el lateral.\nFinalmente Deco recondujo la situación y lo convenció para renovar, también atendiendo a que la Juventus, su principal pretendiente, no estaba en condiciones de hacer frente a un gran traspaso.\nJunto a Araújo el Barça también renovó el contrato del lateral Gerard Martín, que finalizaba al acabar esta temporada y se prolongó hasta 2028.\nEl catalán, que cumplirá 23 años en febrero, fichó procedente del Cornellà en julio de 2023, incorporándose al filial hasta que Hansi Flick determinó su ascenso al primer equipo tras la gira por Estados Unidos del pasado verano.\nPor su parte Araújo mantendrá su cláusula de rescisión en los mil millones de euros que se fijó cuando firmó por última vez, en abril de 2022, con la intención de permanecer en el club, tal como entonces y rechazando otras propuestas.\nSi durante el verano de 2024, antes de sufrir su grave lesión durante la disputa de la Copa América, existieron rumores acerca de su intención de abandonar el club y forzar un traspaso, al comenzar el año, ya recuperado, estas especulaciones, con la Juventus en el primer plano, aumentaron.\nNo fue hasta que Hansi Flick en primera persona apostó por su continuidad que la marcha de Araújo fue poco a poco enfriándose, más aún cuando tras la conquista de la Supercopa de España sus compañeros se lo pidieron directamente.\nFinalmente una conversación con Deco, director deportivo del Barcelona, aceleró el acuerdo, que se concretó este jueves en las oficinas del club, en las que se personó el futbolista junto a sus agentes y familiares, en un encuentro con Joan Laporta, el vicepresidente deportivo Rafa Yuste y Deco.\nFichado en agosto de 2018 por 5.2 millones de euros (contando el fijo inicial más los variables que se fueron abonando después), Araújo debutó a las órdenes de Ernesto Valverde con el primer equipo en octubre de 2019 durante un partido frente al Sevilla en el que, curiosamente, fue expulsado.\nPasó a ser futbolista del primer equipo en octubre de 2020 y hasta el partido de Champions en Lisboa frente al Benfica suma 155 partidos oficiales con el Barça, a los que se agregan los 44 que disputó entre 2018 y 2020 con el filial.\nApartado del escenario por su lesión y, también, por el excelente rendimiento ofrecido por Iñigo Martínez, la renovación de Araújo también se complicó por las propias dudas del defensor uruguayo respecto a su protagonismo en el equipo, no descartándose la posibilidad futura de que, si él lo considerara, pudiera ser traspasado siempre que el Barcelona recibiera una oferta millonaria.",
