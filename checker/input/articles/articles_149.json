    "text": "After temporarily scaling back in India, Worldcoin has launched its services in Singapore. According to the latest announcement, individuals in Singapore will be able to verify their “unique humanness” at an Orb. The move follows the release of World ID 2.0 and the open-sourcing of the Worldcoin iris recognition pipeline in mid-December. Worldcoin’s Worldwide Expansion Apart from World ID verifications, Worldcoin revealed that Tools for Humanity (TFH), a contributor to the project, has joined two prominent startup and technology associations in Singapore: ACCESS and the Singapore Fintech Association (SFA). These project launches and association affiliations follow a recent tour across multiple cities in Asia conducted by members of the TFH product development team. Co-created by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Worldcoin is centered around identity verification and utilizes its Orb devices to scan individuals’ irises to confirm their humanity. The project rewards participants with WLD tokens when they sign up for the protocol. In addition to Singapore, the availability of World ID verifications has been steadily growing across various countries in the past month. The Worldcoin website indicated that verification locations were accessible in 11 nations. In Spain, Sevilla and Bilbao recently joined the expanding list of cities offering World ID verifications, which includes locations from Malaga to Mallorca to Madrid. Additionally, new launches in Cologne and Leipzig have increased the number of Orb locations in Germany to four, including Berlin and Nuremberg, as per Worldcoin’s official [ blog post](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/singapore-launch-user-growth-expansions-landmark-year-worldcoin). In South America, Chile has extended access to World ID verifications in Concepcion, Curico, Viña del Mar, and Santiago. Meanwhile, Argentina achieved a new national record with over 10,000 verifications daily. Across the Pacific in Japan, the city of Fukuoka on Kyushu Island has been added to the list of locations, along with new options in Tokyo, for conducting proof of personhood verification through World ID. As per TFH, more than five million accounts have been created so far, positioning it as the fifth most widely used hot wallet globally in 2023, alongside the Bitcoin.com wallet. On the other hand, the monthly active users of the World App have reached 1.7 million, and the total number of transactions conducted on the application has surpassed 30 million. Services Scaled Back in India, Brazil, and France Despite a series of expansions and partnerships, Worldcoin quietly [halted](https://cryptopotato.com/worldcoin-quietly-halted-orb-verification-in-india-months-ago-report/) operations in India and discontinued registration services in Brazil and France. The project later clarified that its activities in Brazil and France were intended as limited previews, with plans for a more substantial rollout in 2024. Simultaneously, Orb verification services in India were temporarily paused as the company works on implementing a customized, secure, and organized registration process in response to the high demand.

    "text": "(Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\nWith the Dallas Cowboys still dealing with the aftermath of an ugly playoff loss to the upstart Green Bay Packers in the first round last season, America’s Team has been dealing with nothing but distractions during this NFL offseason, with Dak Prescott’s contract situation being at the top of the list.\nAfter losing to the Packers the way they did, many anticipated the Cowboys making some drastic moves this offseason, but that didn’t happen, as longtime team owner Jerry Jones has taken an unexpected direction.\nThat direction is being intent on sticking by head coach Mike McCarthy and signing Prescott to a lucrative long-term deal, which could be big enough to reset the quarterback market in the NFL, and that might not be sitting well with the diehard fans of the storied franchise.\nHowever, a deal between Prescott and the Cowboys has yet to get done, leading some to think he could be playing elsewhere after next season, which the veteran quarterback seems to be coming to terms with via Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team.\n“I’m gonna say it. I want to be here, but when you look up—all the great QBs I watched played for other teams. That’s not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision,” Prescott said.\n#Cowboys QB Dak Prescott: \"I'm gonna say it. I want to be here, but when you look up—all the great QBs I watched played for other teams. That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\" 👀\n(🎥 @JetthroTV ) pic.twitter.com/03NH7kaxHl\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) July 25, 2024\nWith the Cowboys having one of the most talented teams on both sides of the football, it would be a shame to see it all fall apart, but that could happen, with CeeDee Lamb also wanting a new deal and Micah Parsons likely being the next in line after that.\nDallas will be expected to have a solid 2024 campaign, but things are definitely not trending in the right direction right now as the team is dealing with constant distractions rather than a focus on the field as training camp gets underway.",

    "title": "Oil prices roughly flat as unclear demand scenario weighed",
    "text": "Oil prices meandered on Friday as investors pondered slowing demand forecast by an influential group and weak U.S. retail sales data that sparked optimism about U.S. interest rate cuts. Brent crude futures dropped 11 cents, or 0.1%, to $82.75 a barrel at 0131 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1 cent to $78.04 a barrel. Both contracts climbed over 1% on Thursday as a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. retail sales prompted hopes the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting interest rates in coming months, which could be positive for oil demand. The U.S. Commerce Department report showed retail sales dropped 0.8% in January, the biggest fall since February 2023. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales dipping 0.1%. \"Hopes for U.S. rate cuts provided support on Thursday, but investors are now adjusting their positions ahead of a long weekend in the U.S.,\" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities, noting Feb. 19 is a U.S. holiday. \"While keeping a close eye on interest rate trends, investors will continue to assess whether geopolitical risks in the Middle East will spill over into crude supply chains,\" he said, predicting WTI to trade in the $70-$80 range for a while. Weighing on market sentiment, Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the industrialised world's energy watchdog, said on Thursday global oil demand growth is losing momentum and trimmed its 2024 growth forecast, in sharp contrast to the view held by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The IEA's monthly report said it expects global oil demand to grow by 1.22 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, slightly down from last month's estimate. OPEC on Tuesday stuck to its much steeper growth forecast at 2.25 million bpd. In the Middle East, Hezbollah said on Thursday it fired dozens of rockets at a northern Israeli town in a \"preliminary response\" to the killing of 10 civilians in southern Lebanon, the deadliest day for Lebanese civilians in four months of cross-border hostilities. Meanwhile, Israeli forces said on Thursday they had raided the biggest functioning hospital in Gaza as footage showed chaos, shouting and gunfire in dark corridors filled with dust and smoke.

    "text": "Jan. 5 (UPI) — The goal of humans returning to the moon after more than 50 years will inch closer with the launch of the Peregrine Mission One planned for launch early Monday morning from at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Liftoff aboard a United Launch Alliance Vulcan Centaur rocket — its first flight — is planned for 2:18 a.m. EST, capping a long wait because of delays that date to mid-2022. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic’s Peregrine Mission One will mark the first U.S. lunar landing since the Apollo program’s final 1972 flight. The payload’s scheduled moon landing in February will be adjacent to the largest dark spot on the near side of the moon at a site described as a “geologic enigma.” For registered virtual watchers of the launch, access will be granted to resources like schedule changes and mission-specific information, as well as a commemorative stamp for a virtual guest passport. The Vulcan rocket is to make its first flight, carrying the Peregrine commercial lunar lander for Astrobotic. The Peregrine robotic lander, which will carry experiments, scientific instruments and other payloads, also will carry two prototype satellites for Amazon’s Kuiper broadband constellation. Part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services Initiative, Peregrine Mission One is described as a “commercial robotic lunar delivery service” that will bring needed components to help humans sustain life in space. Observers consider this a a crucial step in the Artemis moon program, in which the 10-day Artemis II mission planned for late this year will bring humans the farthest from Earth any astronaut has been. NASA is looking to land astronauts on the moon in the Artemis III mission, which the space agency predicts will happen before the end of 2025. But that depends on a lot of contractors, including SpaceX, and space observers have said that date might be too optimistic. One of 14 NASA providers under contract able to bid on task orders, so far only nine task orders have been granted to five providers — Astrobotic included — set to deliver over 40 loads to the moon’s surface until 2025. The chosen delivery providers are responsible for their own launch, lander design and landing operations. Nine U.S.-based companies were selected in 2018 to be eligible vendors to bid on contracts, with five more added the next year. “Robotic science investigations delivered to the moon … will lay the foundation for a new era of solar system science to better understand planetary processes and evolution, to search for evidence of water and other resources, and support long-term, sustainable human exploration,” NASA said. Through November, commercial contracts through NASA have a combined value of $2.6 billion. ULA’s Vulcan rocket production spanned five states — Washington, Utah, Colorado, Alabama and Florida.",
