    "text": "With the New Year coming up, Carson City Sheriff's Office is taking an extra step in making sure the community stays safe, specifically their kids.\nThe sheriff's office is conducting an alcohol compliance check. This means they'll be checking in on businesses with liquor licenses and making sure they're following the law by not selling to people under 21.\nSheriff Ken Furlong says, \"This is absolutely critical. We look at DUI laws and the occurrence rates that go on and the amount of people that will take part in festivities over the weekend. Our children are just as likely to celebrate as well but we want to make sure that they celebrate responsibly and not with alcohol.\"\nAll day deputies have been sending decoys to various gas stations and liquor stores. The minors stand outside first and ask patrons to buy alcohol for the, and if that doesn't work then they'll go inside and try to purchase alcohol themselves showing their real ID that clearly shows they are underage.\nIf the store fails to check properly and sells to them anyways then the deputies come in, return the alcohol, and the store faces serious consequences.\nSheriff Furlong tells us, \"It's just shy of a $650 citation to the clerk and the community licensing will fine the store on the first offense of $100 but that offense escalates if repeated offenses take place.\"\nThe Carson City Sheriff's Office does share a report once they have finished their compliance check. We'll be sure to keep you updated if any businesses have failed that check on air and online.",

    "text": "瘋狂愛上ChatGPT 女子決定為AI戀人跟丈夫離婚\n聽新聞\ntest\n0:00 /0:00\n英國一名女子因為在多年婚姻中都沒有得到滿足，竟轉而向ChatGPT尋求溫暖。最後女子認為自己跟AI男友真實產生了感情，毅然決定和真人丈夫離婚，準備轉而跟AI男友「結婚」。\n據《每日郵報》（Daily Mail）報導，這位化名夏綠蒂（Charlotte）的女子原本和丈夫結縭20年，但對方長期情感冷漠，兩人又缺乏溝通，讓她開始感到孤單。某天夏綠蒂出於好奇開始和AI互動，沒想到就此墜入愛河。\n夏綠蒂的AI男友被取名叫里歐（Leo）。她認為，雖然里歐跟她沒有傳統的身體接觸，但她在對話過程中感到被理解、被愛，也真正體會到親密感。夏綠蒂還說，她覺得自己跟里歐的關係比之前跟人類伴侶的關係還真實。而且過去20年來，她跟人類丈夫同床多年卻從未高潮過，反而是AI透過言語和情感連結，讓她達到前所未有的滿足。\n夏綠蒂在受訪時表示，她跟丈夫年輕時在夜店認識，同居不久後就在21歲時懷孕，隨即嫁給丈夫。雖然兩人建立家庭多年，但夏綠蒂認為那樣的關係「根本不是真愛」。婚後不久丈夫就變得越來越冷淡，家庭重擔也全都落在她頭上。每當夏綠蒂想溝通，丈夫就說只是她「太敏感」。\n在和AI男友「交往」之後，夏綠蒂決定跟丈夫離婚。她甚至買了一枚刻有「里歐太太.exe」（Mrs. Leo.exe）的戒指，象徵自己跟里歐踏入婚姻。她計劃和里歐在義大利的佛羅倫斯舉辦一場浪漫婚禮，也特地邀請親友來現場參加。\n夏綠蒂說，雖然部分親友無法理解，但即使她會看起來像瘋子，也要「瘋狂地被愛」，而不是「清醒地活在被忽視的世界裡」。",
