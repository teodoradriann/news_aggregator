    "title": "Byron York: Biden finally admits there’s a crisis at the border",
    "text": "What do you call it when somewhere between 6 and 8 million people enter the United States illegally in the course of three years? Many people would call it a crisis, albeit a man-made one, since the reason so many have been able to cross illegally into the United States is the refusal, by President Joe Biden, to enforce immigration laws that authorize him to stop the incursion at any time. For years, the Biden administration denied the seriousness of the situation and steadfastly refused to call the crisis a crisis. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in particular, has gone to great lengths to avoid the word. On many occasions Mayorkas has conceded that the situation is a “challenge,” but definitely, absolutely, totally not a crisis. On March 1, 2021, as the Biden administration was just beginning its long, ambitious project to open the border, Mayorkas met the press in the White House briefing room and pointedly declined to call the situation on the border, in which the number of illegal crossers was already skyrocketing, a “crisis.” Mayorkas wouldn’t even discourage illegal crossers from coming to the border. He just asked them to wait a little while so the Biden administration could get things ready for them. “We are not saying, ‘Don’t come,'” Mayorkas said. “We are saying, ‘Don’t come now because we will be able to deliver a safe and orderly process to them as quickly as possible.'” And on it went. As the number of illegal crossings grew and grew, Mayorkas would declare, with a straight face, that the border was “closed.” He told potential illegal border crossers not to come while at the same time worked to increase the administration’s ability to process, care for, and relocate the illegal crossers. Talk about a mixed message. Nobody listened to the administration’s declaration that the border was “closed.” Instead, they just came right in, and, as promised, Biden allowed most of them to stay. Through it all, the president would never agree that the situation on the border constituted a crisis. So now, fast forward to today’s standoff in the Senate over a bill that would include, all in one big package, aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, aid to Taiwan and a far-reaching reworking of the immigration system. Biden has insisted that they must all be passed together, all or nothing. If Congress were to pass a bill with one or two of those provisions, but not the others, Biden has said he would veto it. The problem with Biden’s ultimatum is that it is almost impossible to pass a far-reaching reworking of the immigration system. Lawmakers have tried and failed for decades. It is the most difficult and intractable issue in American politics. So Biden has linked desperately needed aid to Ukraine, for example, to passing an immigration bill, which reduces the chances of success to nearly zero. With Congress deadlocked, Biden has begun to make wild promises. Campaigning in South Carolina recently, he said, “If that bill were the law today, I’d shut down the border right now and fix it quickly.” That’s hard to believe, to say the least. From the moment he became president of the United States, Biden has had the authority to stop or restrict the flow of illegal migrants into the U.S. He needs no new law to give him that authority. In fact, what the bill under consideration would actually do is regularize the arrival of up to 5,000 illegal migrants into the United States each and every day. Only if the level rose above that for a week would Biden take action to stop the flow. And even then, as always, there would be a lot of restrictions. But give Biden this: In his desperate campaigning for an immigration bill, the president has done something else neither he nor anyone in his administration has ever done: He has admitted that the situation on the border is a crisis. In a statement last Friday, Biden said he had directed administration officials “to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators to seriously, and finally, address the border crisis.” He finished the statement with a challenge to Congress: “If you’re serious about the border crisis, pass a bipartisan bill and I will sign it.” A crisis! Finally, Biden has conceded what has been obvious from nearly the moment he took office. That won’t make the Capitol Hill negotiations go any better — they are probably doomed to fail — but it is a major step in the president admitting reality. — Byron York is chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner.

    "title": "BIF issues a rebuttal to COAI's submissions on satellite spectrum pricing",
    "text": "Tensions are escalating between telecom operators and major technology and satellite firms over the sector regulator’s recent recommendations to the government on satellite spectrum pricing.\nRebutting the operators’ claims that the regulator kept the spectrum pricing low and non-transparent, Google, Meta, OneWeb, Hughes, Amazon, Tata’s Nelco, among others, have argued that the argument for a “level playing field” between satellite-based communication services and terrestrial networks is both legally unsound and factually incorrect.\nThe Broadband India Forum (BIF), which represents Big Tech and satellite companies, wrote to the Centre on Wednesday that there was no question of a level playing field, given the vast differences in technologies, services, infrastructure costs, and spectrum assignment methods.\n“The association (read the Cellular Operators Association of India) has made misleading submissions to block entry of legitimate next generation satellite services and deny consumers their constitutional and fundamental right to exercise a choice of services and service providers,” said TV Ramachandran, president of BIF, in a letter to telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.\n“No review is warranted, and the attempt to mischaracterize and misinterpret the recommendations must be firmly rejected,” Ramachandran said, adding that the telecom operators’ association is delaying the process of bridging the digital divide and the acceleration towards achieving a digitally empowered India.\nThe letter was also marked to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti, economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth, DPIIT secretary Amardeep Singh Bhatia, MeitY secretary S. Krishnan, and members of Digital Communications Commission . DPIIT refers to the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, and MeitY is the ministry of electronics and information technology.\nMarket size\nThe COAI had written to the government on 29 May to the government, arguing that TRAI’s pricing for satellite spectrum is unjustifiably low, non-transparent, and does not lead to a level-playing field. It had said the recommendation of spectrum usage charges—set at 4% of adjusted gross revenue—without any entry fee or upfront payment is inconsistent with the approach followed so far in case of administrative spectrum allocations, and is without any rationale, empirical analysis, international benchmarking or economic justification. Further, the COAI also argued that the satellite internet will compete with terrestrial services, rather than being complementary.\nHowever, BIF’s Ramachandran said, “The association’s (COAI) claims are far detached from reality as its own members have made public announcements of forming a business/commercial partnership with global satellite service providers, thereby demonstrating complementarity between terrestrial and satellite services.”\nTo be sure, telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio in March announced partnership with American satcom player SpaceX to distribute Starlink’s satellite services in India. Still, the operators have flagged concerns over the sustainability of satcom services in case TRAI’s recommendations are implemented in the present form. Recently, Starlink got the licence from the department of telecommunications (DoT) to start its satellite services in the country.\nOn the argument of competition, the BIF said the economic scale of telecom and the two are vastly different. Terrestrial operators in India generate over ₹3.36 trillion annually, while the combined satellite communication market barely touches ₹540-600 crore—a mere 0.2% of telco revenue, according to BIF. “This comparison alone discredits any claim of market overlap or substitutability. Device costs and installed base also show a scale disparity. The cost of the devices is of the order of ₹25,000 (satcom) vs ₹5000 (terrestrial) – the scale being of the order of 1:5,” Ramachandran said.\nEven minister of state for communications Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani had told the media on 6 May that firms such as Starlink would only play a small role in India’s connectivity owing to their expensive service, slower speed than mobile connectivity, and small market size as compared to traditional mobile networks.\n“Around the world, Starlink only has less than 50 lakh (5 million) connections. The speed is much lower. Third, it’s quite expensive, both for installation as well as monthly payment,” Pemmasani said. “This (Starlink service) is mainly for maritime, people who are really remote, and where traditional networks cannot reach,” Pemmasani said.\nSpectrum charge\nOpposing the argument of “low-pricing” of satellite spectrum as claimed by COAI, BIF showed a comparison of the spectrum cost for satellite and telecom operators to the government in the letter.\n“The per-user spectrum charge is ₹635 higher than the spectrum charge levied on cellular or terrestrial broadband services in urban areas. The comparison reveals that even if a satcom operator were to earn zero revenue in urban areas, it would still pay a minimum SUC (spectrum usage charge) of ₹500 per customer per annum, which is approximately 1.85x the per-customer spectrum burden of terrestrial service providers,” Ramachandran said.\nHe added that the total spectrum charge per year to be paid by the telecom operators comes to ₹28,293 crore, and the total mobile subscribers of the private operators are 106.8 crore. This brings the spectrum charge paid per mobile customer by the terrestrial players to ₹265.\nSatcom companies will have to pay annual spectrum charges of either 4% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) or ₹3,500 per MHz, whichever is higher. Additionally, TRAI has recommended an additional annual charge of ₹500 per subscriber for such service providers in urban areas. To be sure, satcom operators will also have to pay an annual licence fee of 8% of AGR to the government, according to the current authorization terms of the DoT.\n“These figures decisively show that the claims of “low” spectrum charges are incorrect, and there is in fact no case of “favourable treatment” or “regulatory advantage” or “regulatory arbitrage” towards satellite-based services”, Ramachandran said.\nData capacity\nIn its letter, the COAI had also alleged that TRAI underestimated the potential capacities of satellite networks while possibly overstating those of terrestrial networks while arriving at the pricing. It had said that companies such as Kuiper and Starlink are expected to have planned capacities of 29 billion gigabytes (GB) data per month, and are well-positioned to serve a significant portion of India’s growing telecom data demand. This is greater than the operators’ 23 billion GB current data traffic, according to the COAI letter.\nHowever, Ramachandran said, “The Association (COAI) has projected estimates of future planned capacity numbers for both the Starlink and Kuiper constellations that they assume will exist upon the completed full-scale deployment of both constellations several years in the future. This understanding is based on unverified public data and inaccurate facts.”\nHe added that the comparison of satcom capacity (through unverified data and inaccurate figures) with traffic of terrestrial services is erroneous, as it is not a like-for-like comparison. “As per Starlink Progress Report 2024, the total global capacity of Starlink is 340 Tbps. If we distribute this over India in proportion to the surface area of India as a percentage of the earth’s surface (340 Tbps x 0.64%), it will be 2.1 Tbps. This is also the capacity figure estimated by TRAI in its recommendations,” Ramachandran said.\nThe COAI had claimed that companies such as Kuiper and Starlink are expected to have capacities of 51 Tbps and 83 Tbps over India.\nSubsidy\nAgainst the telecom operators’ argument that there should not be any subsidy for satellite user terminals through the Digital Bharat Nidhi Fund, BIF said that where commercial viability is structurally difficult, targeted support is not only permissible—it is essential to reduce the financial burden on unserved and underserved subscribers in rural and remote areas.\nFor targeted subscribers in unserved or underserved regions in rural and remote areas, the regulator has recommended that the government consider a subsidy for each fixed user terminal at an appropriate amount.\n“As their (COAI) claims lack credibility and are contradicted by public announcements by the members of the Association, this is a case of misrepresentation before the Regulator and the Government,” Ramachandran said, adding that there should not be any review of TRAI’s recommendations basis the arguments of telcos.\nThe government is finalising the spectrum pricing and other rules for satellite internet firms to start services in the country.

    "title": "Эксперты рассказали о росте зарплат инженеров и архитекторов в 2025 году",
    "text": "Согласно исследованиям группы «Самолет», платформы hh.ru и агентства ORO, в 2025 году наибольший рост зарплат среди профессий строительной отрасли зафиксирован у инженеров и архитекторов. Кроме того, специалисты в сфере девелопмента оказались наиболее удовлетворены своей работой по сравнению с другими отраслями. Результаты исследований были представлены 7 августа.\nУдовлетворенность работой и престиж профессии\nИсследование показало, что 80% работников в девелопменте довольны своим текущим местом работы. Большинство из них (85%) считают свою профессию престижной, а 86% — прибыльной. Практически все опрошенные (90%) отмечают, что их работа очень полезна для общества. Почти половина (48%) сотрудников девелопмента готовы рекомендовать свое текущее место работы другим.\nРост заработных плат\nНаиболее значительный скачок в зарплатах произошел у инженеров и специалистов технического надзора. Их доходы выросли на 25%, составив 125 тысяч рублей вместо 100 тысяч рублей. Архитекторы заняли второе место по росту зарплат, увеличив свои доходы на 19% – до 119 тысяч рублей (ранее 99 тысяч рублей). Замыкают тройку лидеров инженеры ПТО, чьи оклады поднялись на 18%, с 106 тысяч до 126 тысяч рублей.\nСамые высокооплачиваемые позиции и оценка навыков\nСамыми высокооплачиваемыми должностями в России остаются директор по строительству (200 тысяч рублей), начальник строительного участка (178,9 тысяч рублей) и менеджер по продажам недвижимости (177 тысяч рублей). Опрос показал, что управленцы часто переоценивают свою стоимость, в то время как архитекторы, наоборот, занижают. Инженеры ПТО и строительного контроля, по мнению аналитиков, наиболее точно оценивают свои навыки и стоимость.\nГеография зарплат и спрос на специалистов\nМаксимальные зарплаты на аналогичных позициях отмечены в Татарстане, Москве, Санкт-Петербурге, Екатеринбурге, Тюменской области и Приморском крае. Москва остается лидером по спросу на специалистов в строительстве. Во втором квартале 2025 года в столице было размещено 5928 вакансий для инженеров и конструкторов, 1759 — для архитекторов и 1101 — для главных инженеров.\nКадровый дефицит в строительной отрасли\nРанее, 27 июля, Мария Корельская, директор по организационному развитию ГК ТОЧНО, подчеркнула, что кадровый дефицит в строительной отрасли является одним из ключевых рисков. Эта проблема напрямую влияет на себестоимость проектов, сроки ввода объектов и общую устойчивость девелоперского бизнеса.",

    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla. - Michael Burkett and his team put together boxes of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local items for delivery. For more than a year, the Navy veteran and his wife have been growing their business called \"Farmbox Florida.\" Burkett said the business sends out about 400 weekly deliveries, and they&apos;re approaching 1,000 customers. \"Basically, what we try to do is source locally, get local products, and get connecting the residents with the farmers, right? And just getting them the very best quality product that we can. You know, it&apos;s a subscription-based delivery service,\" he said. READ: Are potatoes a vegetable?: US dietary guidelines could change definition in 2025 He started thinking about this concept during the pandemic. \"You know, it&apos;s you either go to the grocery store and buy the services there, and you don&apos;t know how long it&apos;s been sitting on the shelves. Right? So what we do is we source it locally or beginning it, you know, a day or two before we put it in the boxes,\" said Burkett. \"And, it gives the customers a much longer shelf life, and they&apos;re getting much fresher product without all the GMOs and things like that.\" What&apos;s inside the box can vary. Burkett said Farmbox Florida tries to mix up the menu each week, and customers also have the ability to customize that menu. \"So if I&apos;m doing, you know, lettuce that week, but they want to substitute for kale, we&apos;ll always give them the ability to substitute something out,\" Burkett said. \"If we&apos;re doing winter squash, they may not want it, so they could substitute for a yellow squash, or it&apos;s a game. So, there&apos;s many different items that they can substitute for.\" MORE: Study suggests this ingredient leads to better coffee What he said he likes best is that his bottom line isn&apos;t the only one that benefits. \"Being able to to work with the local farmers and regional farmers. And we also do a lot of artisan vendors. Just putting money right back into the community. You know, we try to, it&apos;s community based and that&apos;s what we love about it,\" said Burkett.

    "text": "Paighton Noel’s mom died while she was in medical school. A medical student left a message to her late mom via a voicemail after matching for a residency program of her choice and the emotional moment was captured in a video that was shared online. When Paighton Noel was accepted into University of Utah as a medical student in 2020, she made a phone call to her mom Jacquie Sorrells to deliver her the news. \"I am accepted into University of Utah's medical class of 2020,\" Paighton told her mom at the time. Sorrells later can be heard responding with so much joy in her voice, saying, \"How many tears did you cry? And I said, 'Just stay positive, just stay positive, it's gonna happen, I know it's gonna happen. I can feel it.'\" \"Oh I wish you would have a little more faith in yourself, because I have a lot in you,\" her mom added at the time. Sorrells died during her daughter's third year of medical school after suffering from a traumatic brain injury, Noel said in an interview with \"Good Morning America.\" Four years after making the phone call about getting into the medical school, Noel decided to share another big news with her mom who is no longer with her. \"Hey mom, it's me. I am going to be an OB-GYN at UMC Chapel Hill,\" she said in the voicemail she left for her mom. \"Regardless of where I ended up today, you were going to look out for me and get me to where I needed to go.\" Noel told \"GMA\" she made the second phone call because she \"needed some time\" with her mom after attending the Match Day, which is the day when the National Resident Matching Program releases results to applicants seeking residency and fellowship training positions in the U.S. \"Match Day is just a very, very emotionally charged day, I think, for anyone and pretty much any circumstance,\" she explained. \"Match Day has just high stakes, high emotions, you open up that envelope, and you have your future kind of laid out for you… And there's huge excitement and there's anxiety and there's heartbreak at times and shock, just so many emotions that people go through and I just felt like I was missing my person and my person [is] my mom.\" As for her advice for anyone who is missing their loved ones at a milestone or Holiday celebration, Noel said, \"It is 100% okay to have it feel horrible and incomplete. And it's also 100% okay to feel the joy and celebrate that accomplishment or that holiday, because they would want you to.\" \"And I think trying to find ways to keep them a part of these milestones in these next events in your life has helped me somewhat,\" she said, adding that \"Everything is bittersweet.\"",
