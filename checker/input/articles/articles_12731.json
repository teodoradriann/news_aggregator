    "text": "By Tom Harle ,\n2 hours ago Great Britain shook off their knockout round voodoo at the Paralympics by defeating Australia in the quarter-finals and Germany in the semis. Getty Images Bench strength has been the key to Great Britain ’s wheelchair basketballers ending 28 years of hurt at the Paralympics . Six times in a row Terry Bywater and company fell in the final four at the Games, a miserable run stretching back to Sydney 2000.\n“They all hurt,” said Bywater. “The quarter and the semi-final are the worst games you can play in. It’s heartbreaking.”\nHolding a slender four-point advantage at the halfway stage of their semi-final against Germany at Paris 2024 , nerves were creeping in and maybe even deja vu.\n“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t thinking about (semi-finals) and it was in the back of my mind,” said Pratt, who is one of over 1,000 elite athletes on UK Sport’s National Lottery-funded World Class Programme, allowing them to train full time, have access to the world’s best coaches and benefit from pioneering medical support – which has been vital on their pathway to the Paris 2024 Games.\n“My first one was at Rio in 2016, we lost against Spain in the semi-final and we should have won that game. I was like, man, I don’t want that to happen again.”\nGB’s Canadian coaches Billy and Joey Johnson brought Peter Cusack, a debutant unburdened by the yoke of history, into the game two minutes into the third quarter.\nThe 25-year-old brought a new level of physicality and intensity to the contest, particularly at the defensive end, and his introduction basically broke the back of the German challenge.\nGB went on an 18-3 run to take total control and they eased over the line 71-43 to make the gold medal game for the first time since Atlanta 1996.\n“Pete came into the game at a crucial moment, when we couldn’t get going,” said skipper Phil Pratt, “I don’t know if that would have happened in the past. The culture of this team has changed a lot.\n“The faith we’ve got in our younger guys, the bench, the depth, we’ve got Terry Bywater who is one of the best scorers ever to play the game on our bench.\n“Abdi Jama, if we need those guys to come in, they’ll do a job.”\nBywater, finally tasting semi-final victory at the seventh attempt, was only needed for four and a half minutes when the game was sewn up.\n“We’re hard as nails and never give up, we showed that at half-time when it could easily have gone the other way,” said Bywater. “We stick together and with the bench we have, lads can score points quickly.\n“That’s the kind of squad we have and it doesn’t reflect in the minutes played. If the coaches need me for 20 minutes, I’m ready.”\nDespite being perennial bridesmaids at the Paralympics, the team have won a medal at every European Championships since 2002. GB have stepped up a gear since losing to the USA in the 2022 World Championship final by a single point.\nGreater strength in depth has helped Britain break their semi-final hoodoo but they are built around three pillars of production.\nLee Manning has been a vital defensive player throughout the Paralympics and will have a big role to play in the final. (Getty Images) Pratt is one of the best playmakers in the game and he dictates from the point, while 6ft4in Lee Manning is among the world’s biggest players and has a massive reach, enabling him to block a high volume of shots and dominate the defensive boards.\nChicago Bulls famously built their legend on the principle of ‘give the ball to Michael (Jordan) and get out of the way’ and the same can be said for ParalympicsGB and Gregg Warburton, who put up 35 points and took exactly half of all of his team’s shots.\nThey might not be able to be so reliant on Warburton for scoring in the final - likely against USA - but the Mancunian is one of the hottest hands in the tournament.\n“First and foremost is I’m brave and I want the ball whenever the moment,” said Warburton. “It’s tough when you miss two or three in a row and their bench is shouting, the crowd’s going wild. It’s difficult, especially if you know you can make it and you’ve worked so hard.\n“But the boys are right behind me, screaming, ‘keep taking them shots’ and that just spurs you on so much. That’s the way we want to keep playing.”\nNational Lottery players raise more than £30m a week for Good Causes including vital funding into sport – from grassroots to elite.

    "text": "Easthampton mayor takes part in call featuring President Biden, details support for president amid post-debate fallout With President Biden’s re-election campaign in question, a mayor from Western Massachusetts was one of a couple hundred who were joined by the president on a conference call this week. Easthampton Mayor Nicole LaChapelle tells WAMC she is standing with Joe Biden as the president faces a growing number of calls to step aside ahead of November’s election. The mayor of Easthampton since being elected in 2017 says she and around 200 other mayors ended up on a call with the president Tuesday after the Biden campaign reached out to the Democratic Mayors Association. Initially, the meeting was going to focus on platforms and mayoral feedback. A short time before it started, she says, the mayors were informed Biden would be making an appearance. “- President Biden is before us on the screen, took a break from NATO, and he, in the first-person, talked about what he was proud of and was able to do directly for cities in the last – three-and-a-half years, and what the plan was going forward,” LaChapelle said. According to LaChapelle, the president spoke in detail about funding for cities, various projects and a host of what she calls “Main Street” issues such as consumer prices. The call came a week-and-a-half after the president’s shaky debate with former President Donald Trump that has led to a number of Democrats calling for Biden to halt his campaign. LaChapelle, who has previously signed on with the Biden-Harris campaign and is a delegate heading to her party’s convention in Chicago next month, says the debate is the latest in a “turbulent” time in the nation’s history. “What I make of the situation is - it's a continuation of a very turbulent, unknown time, and a whole bunch of avenues of, really, global life, and in America, specifically, our political expectations and political processes are not aligned,” she said. “The events from the debate, going forward, are very dramatic, but we're a democracy in very strong standing because we have processes, and while it's easy to say the DNC and the RNC are political entities, they're - very connected to legal apparatus to access the ballot and make sure our ballots and who's on the ballot have integrity, and I think that can get lost out of fear and put us into a different place.” She also shared her thoughts on the debate itself. “Candidly? It was a heck of a bad, bad night. I appreciate the President – it was like the first and third and fourth thing he said was, ‘it was a horrible night,’ and he was very candid about - where he is, as far as getting a lot of things done, and his age and not feeling well, and he owned it and I can say, the process and the integrity of our democracy and elections and voting are still in place and can be in place,” LaChapelle continued. “And I have confidence that President Biden can do it. Sure - is this a different set of circumstances because of age in this race, on both sides? Absolutely. But we've dealt with candidates and had candidates become presidents with a lot of different - adverse conditions or connections. So, what I make of it is - I respect everybody's opinion and concerns and, you know, bless George Clooney, but those people have all been here for the last three-and-a-half years, and what happened on that debate, and having a bad night - like, come on, give me a break. Where have you been?” Calls for the president to step aside have come from Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton of the 6th district, Vermont Senator Peter Welch and New York Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado. A common thread – concerns over Biden’s ability to wage a successful campaign against Trump. Both those in favor and against the president stepping aside have said there is much at stake for the party and country if the incumbent were to lose. For LaChapelle, those stakes include abortion and reproductive rights. “I wish that, maybe the last four presidential elections, I hadn't said, along with many of my colleagues, ‘This is the most important election of our lives,’ because this time around, this is really the most important election of our generation, and - it falls a little flatter,” the mayor said. “But, you talk about reproductive rights and Roe v. Wade - this is something my mother fought for. This is something my grandmother, who's a public health nurse was really concerned about, and they thought that was kind of packed away like, check the box. And so now I'm fighting for it, my daughter's fighting for it ,and I have an 11-month-old granddaughter, and we cannot look her in the eye and say, ‘Hey, you are going to have full right and control over your own body - in a month when you turn one or in 20 years when you turn 21.’ And that's what's on the line. I also think - every vote counts, and I think that the makeup of the Supreme Court shows that, and that's on the line, and that is a lifetime appointment, and the decisions we've seen just in the last session are heartbreaking.” LaChapelle says she is ultimately looking forward to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which starts August 19. Currently the president of the Massachusetts Mayors Association, LaChapelle is serving her last term as mayor, after announcing last year that she would not seek re-election in 2025.",
