    "text": "CBSE’s two-board exam policy will lead to ‘waste of time’, ‘unnecessary stress on students’, say parents. Schools ask for better planning, workload management.\nDownload this eBook to discover the best courses to pursue after 10th standard.\nVagisha Kaushik | June 26, 2025 | 10:12 AM IST\nWill CBSE’s decision to hold Class 10 board exams twice a year from 2026 be a relief or pressure on students? Parents, school principals, and the general public have mixed opinions. While some called the move a ‘waste of time’ and ‘burden’ on both students and parents, others termed it one of the greatest initiatives taken by the central board.\nThe Central Board of Secondary Education on June 25 gave a green signal to bi-annual exams for high school students, after considering the feedback on draft policy released in February.\nMore than 60% of students are okay with writing CBSE board exams 2026 two times, the board claimed, and went ahead with the popular opinion despite reluctance from the teachers who might end up doing double the work. Acknowledging the board’s intention to provide chances to students, schools have pointed out areas requiring better planning.\nWith the introduction of two-board exam scheme, which have been on and off the cards for long, CBSE aims to provide greater flexibility to the candidates and a chance to improve their scores. Phase 2 is completely optional with the second set of exams being especially for improvement, controller Sanyam Bhardwaj clarified.\nIn a positive response, Deepti Vohra, principal of Delhi Public School in RK Puram, said the initiative could help shift focus from rote learning to a more application-based and continuous learning process. \"This is a progressive step and has the potential to reduce exam-related anxiety. It aligns well with the NEP's vision of a flexible and student-centric assessment framework,\" she said. Detailed adjustments in academic planning and infrastructure readiness will help in successful implementation of the scheme, she added.\nOn the other hand, some schools expressed concerns regarding the academic calendar and workload management. Sudha Acharya, principal of ITL Public School in Dwarka, said, \"While the flexibility is welcome, conducting exams over an extended period from February to June may require a revisit at how schools plan teaching and assessments during that time.\" She hinted towards additional support to maintain the balance between examinations and classroom learning.\nAlso read CBSE adopts new re-evaluation process, split Class 10 science question papers; will test on-screen marking\nSharing a similar view, Mallika Premanand, principal of Tagore International School in Vasant Kunj said, \"The idea offers students a second chance to perform better, which is encouraging. However, schools would benefit from further clarity on how this will align with admissions to Class 11 and the overall academic schedule,\" she said.\nAccording to many, the CBSE second attempt will only lead to an unnecessary stress on the students and it has been suggested that the central board can introduce a semester system instead to nullify the load. “Even if students do well in the first exam, parents will push them to retake just for better marks, leading to unnecessary stress,” thinks a techie.\nAnother person raised concerns about holding board exams twice for the whole CBSE syllabus 2026 in a period when the temperature of the country soars, as the board has proposed conducting the second phase in May. “What an inhumane decision by CBSE. Taking the full syllabus exam twice that too at that time where avg temp is 43 degrees. This change does not reflect any positive impact but will prove to be stressful. How is stress distributed here?,” they asked while sharing the feedback on draft norms.\nAlso read CBSE syllabus 2025-26 for Class 10, 12 out; new ‘best of 2’ exam format, must-know changes\nA Jansatta journalist has also questioned the very term ‘second board examinations’, arguing that the second set of exams only appear to be an extension of the improvement provisions and not a real opportunity for students as the ones failing the first board exams will not be allowed to write them.\n“If the second examination is solely improvement in nature, allowing students to appear for a maximum of three subjects, why is it being called a ‘second board examination’ instead of an ‘improvement exam’ or ‘supplementary exam’?,” Sushil Raghav questioned in a series of posts on X.\nThe number of subjects students can take in CBSE improvement exams has been increased to three, he noted, and asked why this minor change is being promoted as a grand initiative.\nTaking a jibe at the people opposing the decision, a media professional said, “Those annoyed with this radical step by CBSE have forgotten that they were also kids one time. So, please get lost. In any case, how many people genuinely care about kids (especially of others’) in the insensitive India we live in? Enjoy, Kiddos!”\nWith inputs from PTI\nFollow us for the latest education news on colleges and universities, admission, courses, exams, research, education policies, study abroad and more..\nTo get in touch, write to us at news@careers360.com.",

    "text": "RomeLe pape, dans un état critique, «a passé une nuit tranquille»\nLe pape François, dans un état critique avec une pneumonie des deux poumons, a passé une nuit «tranquille et s'est reposé», a assuré dimanche matin le Vatican.\nLe pontife argentin de 88 ans, pour lequel le diagnostic des médecins était «réservé» samedi soir, «a passé une nuit tranquille et s'est reposé» à l'hôpital Gemelli de Rome, a annoncé le Saint-Siège sur sa chaîne Telegram. Le chef de l'Église catholique est hospitalisé depuis le 14 février pour une pneumonie des deux poumons et son état s'est dégradé samedi avec «une crise asthmatique prolongée qui a nécessité l'application d'oxygène à haut débit», selon le dernier bulletin de santé.\n«Les analyses de sang effectuées aujourd'hui ont également révélé une thrombopénie (baisse du nombre de plaquettes sanguines, ndlr), associée à une anémie, qui a nécessité l'administration d'une transfusion sanguine. Le Saint-Père reste alerte et a passé la journée dans un fauteuil, bien qu'il souffre davantage qu'hier. Le pronostic est actuellement réservé», a précisé le Vatican dans ce communiqué au ton d'une rare gravité.\nProchains jours «déterminants»\n«La situation est devenue plus préoccupante», a déclaré le virologue Fabrizio Pregliasco, cité dimanche par le quotidien La Stampa. «L'âge du Saint Père, ainsi que les antécédents de santé, comme par exemple la bronchite asthmatique, pourraient avoir compliqué les choses et pas qu'un peu», détaille-t-il.\n«Il faut espérer que la thérapie antibiotique fonctionne pour éviter le risque d'une septicémie, une infection systémique, qui peut avoir une issue fatale. Le pape est certainement en de bonnes mains, mais les prochaines heures et les prochains jours seront déterminants», estime l'expert.\nPrières\nIl sera hospitalisé au moins toute la semaine prochaine et il ne dirigera pas dimanche, pour la deuxième fois d'affilée, la prière de l'Angélus. En début de matinée, une messe se tiendra au Vatican lors de laquelle le pro-préfet du dicastère pour l'Évangélisation lira l'homélie préparée par le pape.\nPlusieurs responsables religieux et politiques ont dit prier pour le pape, dont le président américain Donald Trump qui «est informé» de la situation, a fait savoir la Maison-Blanche. Depuis samedi soir, sur les réseaux sociaux, les internautes ont aussi posté des centaines de messages disant prier pour François, beaucoup postant une photo de l'évêque de Rome seul sur la place Saint-Pierre lors de la pandémie de Covid-19.\nAucune disposition en cas de problème grave\nFrançois a été hospitalisé initialement pour une bronchite, mais le Saint-Siège a révélé mardi qu'il avait développé une pneumonie dans les deux poumons, une infection du tissu pulmonaire potentiellement mortelle. Cette hospitalisation, la quatrième depuis 2021, suscite de vives inquiétudes alors que le pape a déjà été affaibli par une série de problèmes ces dernières années, allant d'opérations du côlon et de l'abdomen à des difficultés à marcher.\nL'hospitalisation du pape, à la fois chef spirituel des 1,4 milliard de catholiques dans le monde et chef de l'État de la Cité du Vatican, a relancé les interrogations autour de sa capacité à assurer sa charge, alors que le droit canonique ne prévoit aucune disposition en cas de problème grave qui altèrerait sa lucidité.",

    "text": "Henderson, Tennessee — (Sept. 19, 2024) — Freed-Hardeman University’s Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) program recently completed a transformative medical missions trip to Honduras from July 27 to August 3, 2024. Collaborating with Misión Para Cristo, an organization dedicated to sharing Jesus and serving people in Nicaragua, Haiti and Honduras since 1997, the group of six PTA students and three licensed physical therapists provided essential care to underserved communities.\nThe team worked at The Good Samaritan School, known as “Kingdom Kids,” under the direction of Benny Baker. The school, which serves impoverished children by providing education, food, medicine and care, almost faced closure in 2016 but has continued to thrive through support and dedication. The mission also included service at Predisan Hospital, where students delivered much-needed physical therapy to patients who otherwise lack access to healthcare.\nImpactful Experiences\n“Our goal is to make this trip an annual event,” said Brian Vaughn PT, M.Ed. director of clinical education at the Freed-Hardeman University PTA program. “Through our partnership with Harding’s PT department, we ensure that patients are seen at least twice a year. Our mission is to serve the physical needs of the community first, demonstrating Christ through our actions and service.”\nThe students’ experiences were deeply impactful and eye-opening. Senior Noah Johnson described how witnessing the living conditions in Honduras reshaped his perspective, stating, “It was eye-opening to see the living conditions in Honduras compared to America. Treating the patients and seeing their reactions made me realize this is the career I want to pursue – possibly even on an international level.”\nJoshua Puente echoed this sentiment, highlighting the power of resourcefulness: “We accomplished so much with limited equipment, proving that physical therapy doesn’t always require advanced tools. It reinforced how impactful our work can be even with the basics.”\nGrace Bennett reflected on the patients’ appreciation, saying, “This trip shifted my perspective. The patients’ appreciation, despite having so little, was humbling. It made me want to give even more, though we had to adapt to the limited time and resources.”\nBrylie Johnson added, “This mission felt different because we directly impacted hundreds of individuals. Even small improvements in patients were incredibly rewarding.”\nAnna Kate Norton, participating in her first mission trip, found the experience enlightening, sharing that it made her more conscious of the disparities in healthcare access. “It was very eye-opening and really touched my heart. Being able to do just a little was big to them, and it made me grateful for what we have here.”\nChase Daniel also shared a memorable encounter with a patient who had been told she needed surgery but was able to avoid it with proper therapy, emphasizing the tangible impact of their work: “Being able to tell her that you don’t necessarily need surgery just lit her face up. She had been saving for surgery that would have cost far more than she could afford, and it was rewarding to know we could help her avoid that.”\nA Broader Vision of Service\nThe PTA students conducted screenings for over 400 children, assessing balance, strength and other physical health indicators, and worked in clinics to provide care for adult patients. This service was critical in a country where 18 percent of the population lacks access to healthcare, and 90 percent of people have no insurance coverage.\nThis trip serves as an additional opportunity for students to put their clinical skills and knowledge into practice while being immersed in a diverse cultural environment,” Vaughn added. “Next year, we plan to expand our efforts by including pre-med students and construction teams, aiming to make an even greater impact.”\nAbout Misión Para Cristo\nMisión Para Cristo operates in Nicaragua, Haiti and Honduras, striving to promote physical, spiritual, social and economic health according to God’s plan. The organization’s mission is to bring wholeness to communities by meeting physical needs first, creating opportunities for spiritual outreach.\nThis partnership between Freed-Hardeman University, Harding University and Misión Para Cristo exemplifies how service-based healthcare can bring, not just physical healing, but also hope and encouragement to those in need.\nFor more information on supporting or joining future missions, visit misionparacristo.com\nThe mission of Freed-Hardeman University is to help students develop their God-given talents for His glory by empowering them with an education that integrates Christian faith, scholarship and service. With locations in Henderson and Memphis, FHU offers associate, bachelor’s, master’s, specialist and doctoral degrees.",
