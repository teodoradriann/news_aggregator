    "text": "La Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos condenó la “desaparición forzada” desde hace nueve días en Nicaragua del obispo Isidoro Mora y una “nueva ola de detenciones de religiosos” por parte del gobierno de Daniel Ortega. Medios de prensa nicaragüenses que trabajan desde el exilio y la abogada Martha Molina, investigadora de temas de la Iglesia de Nicaragua, denunciaron este jueves que la policía detuvo al vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, Carlos Avilés, que se suma a los arrestos en las últimas semanas de otros dos sacerdotes y del obispo Mora. La agencia de la ONU “condena la desaparición forzada del obispo Isidoro Mora en #Nicaragua desde hace 8 días y la nueva ola de detenciones de religiosos”, dijo en la red social X la oficina para América Central y el Caribe, con sede en Panamá. “Además de atentar contra su libertad personal, violarían el derecho a la libertad religiosa, pilar de cualquier Estado democrático”, agregó. La policía nicaragüense aún no se ha referido a la situación de ninguno de los religiosos. Además de Mora, de 53 años y obispo de Siuna, en la región del Caribe nicaragüense, está detenido el obispo Rolando Álvarez, de 57 años, condenado el 10 de febrero a 26 años por traición a la patria, propagación de noticias falsas y desacato, un día después de que rechazara salir a Estados Unidos junto a 222 opositores presos expulsados. La relación entre la Iglesia y el gobierno de Nicaragua se deterioró en medio de las protestas del 2018, luego de que Ortega acusó a religiosos de apoyar a los opositores en lo que consideró un intento de golpe de Estado. Tres meses de bloqueos de calles y choques entre opositores y oficialistas dejaron más de 300 muertos, según la ONU. Álvarez ha preferido la cárcel al exilio y no figuró entre los 12 sacerdotes liberados en octubre y enviados a Roma tras un acuerdo del gobierno con el Vaticano. Con Mora, suman ahora dos los obispos detenidos. Una investigación de Molina, en el exilio en Estados Unidos, sostiene que desde 2018 hubo 740 ataques contra la Iglesia y que 176 sacerdotes y religiosas fueron expulsados, desterrados o se les prohibió ingresar al país.",

    "title": "More than an hour of exercise a week can help with ‘baby blues’, says research",
    "text": "Doing more than an hour of moderate-intensity exercise a week can reduce the severity of the ‘baby blues’ and almost halve the risk of new mothers developing major clinical depression, the largest analysis of evidence suggests.\nHowever, the researchers behind the study recognized that finding time amid so many new responsibilities and challenges would not be easy, and that postpartum recovery must be a priority.\nNew mothers could resume exercise with “gentle” walks, which they could do with their babies, and then increase to “moderate” activity when they were ready, she added.\nThis moderate physical activity can include brisk walking, water aerobics, stationary cycling or resistance training, according to the team of academics in Canada.\nDepression and anxiety in mothers are relatively common after childbirth and are associated with reduced self-care and reduced care and bonding with the child, which in turn could affect the child’s cognitive, emotional and social development, the researchers said.\nConventional treatments for depression and anxiety in the first weeks and months after childbirth usually involve medications and counseling, which are often associated with side effects and poor compliance, and lack of timely access and cost, respectively.\nResearch has previously shown that physical activity is an effective treatment for depression and anxiety in general. But until now it wasn’t known whether it could reduce the severity of the baby blues in the first few weeks after giving birth or lower the risk of severe postpartum depression several months later.\nIn the analysis published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine the researchers looked at 35 studies involving more than 4,000 women from 14 different countries. The team collected data from available evidence on the impact of exercise after childbirth.\nThe risk of developing severe postpartum depression was reduced by 45% among those who exercised, compared to those who did not. And exercise was associated with less severe symptoms of depression and anxiety after giving birth.\nStarting exercise before 12 weeks after birth was associated with a greater reduction in depressive symptoms than starting later. And the greater the training volume, the greater the reduction in symptom severity, the study found.\nTo reap the benefits of exercise, women should do at least 80 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week, the academics said. Ideally, they should try to be active on at least four days of the week, she added.\nThe lead author, Prof. Margie Davenport, from the University of Alberta, said light exercise in the first weeks after birth, such as gentle walking, can really help.\n“Once (the mother) has recovered from childbirth, taking short leisurely walks is encouraged. Walking is a great way to get exercise, and it’s something you can do with your baby,” she said.\n“As she is ready to start more vigorous exercise, we recommend a gradual but progressive approach.\n“It is important that attention is paid to symptoms such as poor recovery after exercise, which causes exercise to progress too quickly. Those who experience urinary incontinence are recommended to speak to a pelvic floor physiotherapist for assessment and treatment.\n“Everyone’s ideal start time will be different, balancing the need to recover and heal after giving birth with the willingness to become physically active to reap both physical and mental health benefits.”",

    "text": "The Oregon Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division needs to do a better job translating its online web portal for people who don’t speak English and making sure customer data is secure, a mostly positive audit found.\nThe report released Wednesday by the Audits Division of the Secretary of State’s Office doesn’t address the DMV’s latest high-profile data issue: revelations that it wrongly sent information for 1,561 people who didn’t prove citizenship to election officials to automatically register them to vote. At least 10 of the incorrectly registered voters went on to vote, though election officials have since determined five of those 10 were citizens when they voted.\nGov. Tina Kotek ordered a pause to the automatic voter registration program until an independent external audit is completed. That report is expected by the end of the year.\nThe audit also didn’t address a May 2023 hack that put at risk personal information, including birthdates, addresses and driver’s license numbers, for approximately 3.5 million Oregonians. The hack of the file transfer service MOVEit affected more than 2,700 other agencies and organizations and more than 95 million individuals throughout the world.\nTwo Oregonians, Caery Evangelist and Brian Els, filed a class-action lawsuit in Marion County Circuit Court in April over the 2023 hack. The state is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, and a judge has scheduled a call in November to set a date for a hearing on that motion.\nInstead, the state audit looked at how the DMV — which has nearly 900 employees and a two-year budget of $311 million — assesses and collects fees and how well its recently expanded online services are working. Auditors found that the DMV and its computer systems are accurately assessing fees for the roughly 200,000 new drivers’ licenses and more than 350,000 renewals it processes each year, as well as for vehicle registrations, titles and license plates.\nFees for registrations and titles vary depending on the plate design, county where a driver lives, vehicle age and fuel efficiency. Auditors looked at all driver and vehicle transactions during the 2023 fiscal year — more than 20 million rows of data — and found that 99.6% of those transactions were complete, accurate and valid.\nBut they also found that Oregonians who don’t speak English or have limited English proficiency struggle to use the state’s online portal for renewing licenses, vehicle registrations and updating addresses. That portal, DMV2U, relies on Google Translate to translate directions to other languages, and auditors found that it didn’t work well on mobile devices and often failed to translate the site’s content.\nThe audit also found that the DMV wasn’t doing enough to make sure employees could access only data they needed and closing accounts when employees quit.\n“Without robust access controls, unauthorized individuals can clandestinely access sensitive data, copy it and potentially make undetected alterations or deletions for malicious intent or personal gain,” the report said.\nDMV Administrator Amy Joyce wrote in a letter attached to the audit that she agreed with each of the auditor’s recommendations, which included having a more diverse group of people test its online services and periodically reviewing access to DMV data.\nOregon Capital Chronicle is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

    "text": "WASHINGTON — Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC); Ilhan Omar (MN-05), Deputy Chair of the CPC; Greg Casar (TX-35), CPC Whip ; and Barbara Lee (CA-12), CPC Chair Emeritus and Peace and Security Task Force Chair issued the following statement on recent developments in the Middle East:\n“Since October, we have seen a steady escalation between varied armed actors and U.S. forces throughout the Middle East. These rising tensions culminated in this past weekend’s tragedy, where three U.S. service members were killed and dozens wounded in an Iraq-based militia strike on a U.S. base in Jordan.\n“We mourn the loss of these soldiers, as well as the Navy SEALs who were lost earlier this month in a separate Red Sea operation. Since October, 165 attacks have injured more than 120 U.S. service members across the region, and repeated U.S. retaliatory strikes in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq have not deterred these armed groups.\n“We are facing the most serious threat of regional war since Donald Trump’s reckless and unauthorized strike against Iranian General Qassem Soleimani four years ago — so it comes as no surprise that congressional Republicans are now irresponsibly pushing direct military confrontation with Iran. For years, these extreme voices have been fixated on closing the door to diplomacy and drawing the United States into direct conflict with Iran.\n“The American people have no interest in such a conflict, which would erode our nation’s global standing and irreparably damage our national security. As the people’s representatives in Congress, we take seriously our constitutional responsibility over war, peace, and security and we remind the White House that Congress must be involved in and approve of the offensive use of military force.\n“Now is the time to take concrete actions to decrease tensions that threaten our service members. At this dangerous and unpredictable moment, we call for a renewed focus on de-escalation, diplomacy, and on addressing the root causes that have inflamed the region and provoked attacks on U.S. personnel in recent months.”",

    "title": "Company develops window wall technology that can produce solar energy: 'An innovation breakthrough'",
    "text": "Company develops window wall technology that can produce solar energy: &#039;An innovation breakthrough&#039; When you consider that the addition of more solar panels to the grid can both increase renewable energy potential and reduce electricity costs, it seems like a no-brainer to find new places to incorporate them. As reported by Altenergymag, NEXT Energy Technologies in Santa Barbara, California, has already made progress toward transforming modern buildings into solar-energy-generating structures with its NEXT OPV tech. The company has successfully delivered large format glass &quot;wall&quot; panels with transparent organic photovoltaic (OPV) coatings to Gensler headquarters in Los Angeles. Andy Cohen, co-chairmen of Gensler, told Altenergymag, &quot;NEXT Energy Technologies&#039; transparent OPV is an innovation breakthrough for architects that will transform the game plan for sustainable buildings in the near future and for net zero construction for decades to come by turning a building&#039;s glass facade into a source of clean, renewable energy.&quot; So far, OPV panels typically only reach about 11% efficiency in converting light to energy, compared to an average of 15-20% energy efficiency in most commercially available photovoltaic panels, as reported by MarketWatch. There are still plenty of benefits to OPVs, however. These organic versions use carbon-based semiconductors that require far more abundant materials than those typically used in solar panels — and they are much less toxic. They can also harvest light in the invisible infrared and ultraviolet spectrum while still letting visual light pass through them. Watch now: These futuristic gas stations could completely change what it&#039;s like to own an EV The Gensler delivery involved 27- by 35-inch &quot;Lite&quot; panels, which are currently in a pilot run as they try to scale up to the full-scale goal of 60- x 120-inch versions. The OPV coating is a neutral gray and has achieved an efficiency of 3.5%, while its less transparent spandrel glass versions offer up to 12%. NEXT Energy claims that buildings using its OPV-coated glass could handle up to 25% of a commercial building&#039;s energy load while seamlessly blending into the design and not blocking the view, as the Altenergymag report detailed. Researchers have been working with OPVs in a variety of applications, even developing flexible waterproof versions that could end up on clothing. Others have been exploring new organic materials, which may increase the transparency potential of window-based solar generation, according to Phys.org. HeliaTek in Germany has been working on its own organic solar films, which are &quot;ultra-light, flexible, ultra-thin, and truly green.&quot; These can be installed on building facades and other exterior surfaces where traditional photovoltaic panels wouldn&#039;t work. The folks at NEXT Energy are looking toward the future with its enterprise. Its tech is set to last for 30 years or more, can increase points towards LEED certification, and can reward residents with lower carbon pollution and a more sustainable living environment. Homeowners can also make energy-conscious upgrades to their own homes. The addition of rooftop solar panel arrays, geothermal heat pumps, and other green tech can help, with money back available from the government thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act&#039;s tax credit incentives.

    "title": "Afghanistan fast bowler Shapoor Zadran retires from international cricket - ESPN",
    "text": "Afghanistan fast bowler Shapoor Zadran has announced his retirement from international cricket. The tall left-arm quick played 44 ODIs and 36 T20Is since his debut in 2009, and went on to take 80 wickets across both formats. His last international appearance came in 2020, before calling time on his career on Thursday at the age of 37.\nAggressive, and, at times, devastating, he possessed a typical fast bowler's mentality, and cited Shoaib Akthar as his idol.\nCited as a key figure in Afghanistan's rise to prominence on the global scene, he earned wider cult hero status during the 2015 ODI World Cup. His ten dismissals - accompanied by exuberant celebrations - at an average of 26.50 included Steven Smith, David Warner, Kane Williamson, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mahmudullah.\nBut his crowning glory came in Dunedin against Scotland, when he was pivotal to the country's first win at a major tournament.\nAfter taking 4 for 38 from his ten overs to restrict Scotland to 210, Shapoor was on hand down at No. 11 to contribute to an unbeaten final-wicket stand of 19. He even struck the winning boundary which took Afghanistan to a famous one-wicket win with three balls to spare. Shapoor finished on 12 not out, his second-highest ODI score.\nIn a statement released on his Facebook page, Shapoor said the decision to retire was \"one of the toughest decisions\" of his life.\n\"My journey began in the most challenging times of Afghan cricket,\" he said. \"I faced difficulties, played under limited resources, and overcame many obstacles, but I never lost faith. The support of cricket fans, my teammates, coaches, and especially my family kept me going through every hardship. I sincerely thank everyone who stood by my side throughout this long journey.\n\"The love, prayers, and unwavering support of my family, friends, fans, and the people of Afghanistan have been my greatest strength. I will always be grateful for it.\"",

    "text": "EL NUEVO DIARIO, CIUDAD DEL VATICANO.- El papa Francisco se reunió este viernes con el ultraconservador cardenal estadounidense Raymond Burke, uno de los más críticos con su pontificado como ha demostrado públicamente en varias ocasiones, y a quien recientemente decidió quitarle el apartamento en el que vive y rebajar el sueldo.\nDe la reunión no se han conocido detalles y el cardenal, preguntado por el diario «Il Messaggero», prefirió no hacer comentarios, pero seguramente se abordó la decisión de Francisco, que en la reunión del pasado 20 de noviembre con los jefes de los dicasterios (ministerios vaticanos) informó de que eliminaría el alquiler privilegiado del que disfruta el cardenal y reduciría su sueldo.\nSegún algunos medios, el papa habría explicado que el motivo de su gesto era la desunión que crea el purpurado y que está usando ese apartamento y ese sueldo que le pasa el Vaticano precisamente contra la Iglesia.\nEl purpurado estadounidense cumplió 75 años el pasado junio, edad de jubilación de los prelados, fue prefecto del Tribunal Supremo de la Signatura Apostólica y también ex patrono emérito de la Orden de Malta, por lo que no tiene cargo alguno en la Curia vaticana.\nAún así cuenta con un apartamento a pocos metros de la plaza de San Pedro de más de 400 metros cuadrados y ha seguido cobrando un salario vaticano de entre 5.000 y 6.000 euros al mes.\nEl cardenal, uno de los más críticos con Francisco, participó en una conferencia titulada «La Babel sinodal», el día antes de que comenzase el Sínodo, en la que se criticó duramente la asamblea promovida por el papa, en la que por primera vez pudieron votar laicos, y entre ellos mujeres.\nAdemás, con anterioridad Burke y otros cardenales ya retirados, como el alemán Walter Brandmueller, el mexicano Juan Sandoval y el guineano Robert Sarah, así como el arzobispo retirado de Hong Kong Joseph Zen, publicaron una carta con cinco ‘dubia’ (dudas) presentadas a Francisco sobre el Sínodo.\nEn ella expresaban su preocupación porque «la bendición de parejas homosexuales pueda crear confusión, no solo haciendo que parezcan análogas al matrimonio, sino porque los actos homosexuales serían presentados como un bien» y otras cuestiones.\nBurke ya había participado hace años en otra carta con dudas enviada al papa tras la publicación de la exhortación apostólica «Amoris Laetitia».",
