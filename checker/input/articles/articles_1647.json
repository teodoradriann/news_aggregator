    "text": "李松林\n　　这两天，各地高考分数线陆续发布，炒作高分考生的戏码也多了起来。诸如“某地高考首次出现高分屏蔽考生”“一个班3个屏蔽生，老师们沸腾了”“历史类高考屏蔽考生揭秘”等话题不断刷屏。\n　　所谓屏蔽生，是指那些高考成绩在本省（自治区、直辖市）排名较高，因此被屏蔽具体分数的考生。屏蔽的初衷，是为了防止炒作“高考状元”，避免无底线的高分宣传，在保护考生隐私的同时，引导社会理性看待高考分数，减轻家长的教育焦虑。禁止炒作高分生，并非新规，多年来教育部门反复重申。今年2月，教育部发布《关于做好2025年普通高校招生工作的通知》，再次明确提出，不得以任何形式宣传炒作“高考状元”“升学率”“录取率”“高分考生”等。\n　　白纸黑字的禁令在前，学校等已不敢再明晃晃地炒作状元，但暗地里炒作高分生的现象依旧存在。比如有的学校以水果做暗语，以水果个数和克数暗示高分考生人数和分数；有的中学发布高校“抢人”视频；有的家长直播查分、现场晒分数，自媒体跟着大肆宣传。这些做法表面上规避了规定，实则都是变相的宣传。\n　　屏蔽生取得高考佳绩，固然值得祝贺。家长和老师高兴，在朋友圈晒一下也无可厚非。值得警惕的，是部分学校借机宣扬“高考升学率”、教育培训机构借机抬高身价、个别高校违规提前“抢人”，让“唯分数论”“唯升学论”的不良导向再次抬头。\n　　不炒作屏蔽生，应成社会共识。有关部门应有所作为，把类似炒作屏蔽掉。",
