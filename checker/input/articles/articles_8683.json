Starfield, Bethesda’s space adventure game, lets players create their own ships and explore over a thousand planets. Criticized for numerous bugs, notably in certain impossible-to-complete quests, and a feeling of unfinished business, the game unfortunately received many negative opinions. However, this did not prevent Bethesda’s game from becoming one of the most profitable of the year 2023, which is no small thing. The upcoming arrival of the first Shattered Space DLC may allow Starfield to restore its image. Article continues after ad Article continues after ad Whether as part of the main story, side quests or simply when you go looking for loot, you need to be equipped with weapons to protect yourself from the enemies and dangers of the Starfield universe. There are many weapons available in Starfield, and it can be difficult to get your hands on the best ones. And in fact, a player came across an exceptional and overpowering weapon during his space explorations. Bethesda Game Studios Starfield player gets his hands on a powerful weapon Reddit user [u/Jazzlike-Fee-3493](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jazzlike-Fee-3493/) quickly shared his discovery with the Starfield community. Titled ” This gun I found is a monster », the post was accompanied by the image of the famous weapon, with its impressive characteristics. Article continues after ad Article continues after ad This is a Legendary Va’ruun Inflictor. With the Laser and Particle Beam skills, the weapon is simply overpowered. The poster has in fact added mods to his weapon to allow it to achieve formidable efficiency. Subscribe to our newsletter to receive the latest esports news, gaming and more. In the discussion, the praise was quick to arrive. Some were “ jealous » of such a find. Others were quick to comment on the weapon’s exceptional capabilities and impressive ammo count. An admiring player asked: “ 90,000 rounds of Heavy Particle Fuse? That’s all you buy when you sell your loot? ». Article continues after ad Article continues after ad However, many were skeptical about using the Legendary One Inch Punch mod. One player explained: “ Nice but what’s the point of One Inch Punch? I never liked the loss of ranged shooting and the recoil it brings “. Others quickly explained its usefulness: “ This turns the weapon into a shotgun. Damage is not divided between each cartridge. Each inflicts total damage, so in effect it’s a damage multiplier ». Also, the big question many were asking was where the player made such a discovery. His answer ? “ The Vulture’s Perch on Jaffa 4 “. Located in the Jaffa system, above Porrima, Vulture Roost is a relatively secretive and incredibly lucrative area. Indeed, this bar-motel where many enemies find themselves is full of loot and contraband. Article continues after ad Article continues after ad However, be aware that you’ll need plenty of Digipicks to unlock the many contraband chests, doors, and safes in this unmissable location.

    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Fla. (WFTV) - Communion at a Florida church took an unexpected turn when police say an argument ended with a priest biting a woman attending Mass.\nThe incident happened Sunday at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in St. Cloud. Police have recommended that the priest involved, identified on body camera video as Father Fidel, be charged with battery. The church’s website lists a Fidel Rodriguez among its staff as a parochial vicar, but it is not clear if this is the same man.\nThe unidentified woman involved in the incident told police the scuffle started when she tried to receive communion but was denied.\n“He wouldn’t give me the cookie. I don’t know if it was the way I was dressed or what it is that I like,” the woman can be heard saying in the bodycam video.\nA witness told police the woman was singled out because of her sexuality and attire.\n“He tried to forcefully shove it in her mouth. She backed up and said, ‘No, don’t do that.’ She tried to get it, and that’s when he went crazy,” the witness said to police.\nHowever, the priest told police a different story. He says the woman first came to the 10 o’clock Mass but didn’t seem to know the process of receiving communion, so he denied her the bread wafer. He says she came back to another service and tried again.\nThe priest says the confrontation happened when the woman tried to grab the wafer out of his hand, telling police he was protecting the wafer because it is considered the body of Christ.\nHe also appears to admit to biting the woman on bodycam video.\n“I am not judging you. I am asking you, ‘Did you confess after Mass?’ If you did not confess, I can’t give you communion. I bit her. I am not denying that. I was defending myself and the sacrament,” he said to police.",

We know our mistakes but now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast.\n‘If we’re not playing like the last 15 minutes in every game we will struggle, and this has to be a big wake-up call. The first half was not our game and not us. We have to take a big, big lesson.’\nSon admitted it was a ‘very disappointing’ performance from Spurs against Brighton\nTottenham suffered a miserable night on a night where their makeshift defence was exposed\nJack Hinshelwood scored the opening goal for Brighton with a fierce drive beating Vicario\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nManager Ange Postecoglou blamed fatigue brought on by the raft of Spurs absentees as the reason for his side’s limp start.\n‘It’s because we’ve got 10 players injured,’ he said. ‘You can only go to the well so many times, the way we play.\nPervis Estupinan scored a magnificent goal as Brighton earned a 4-2 win over Tottenham\nBrighton doubled their lead from the spot after Dejan Kulusevski pulled back Danny Welbeck\n‘The players have given everything.

    "text": "NATION 20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist Mary Walrath-Holdridge USA TODAY A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
