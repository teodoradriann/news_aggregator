    "text": "Harris County Triumphs: Uplift Harris Guaranteed Income Program Prevails in Court\nBy Francis Page, Jr.\nClick here for updates on this story\nApril 18, 2024 (\nHouston Style Magazine) — Harris County, Texas – In a pivotal court decision, Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis applauds the triumph of the community initiative Uplift Harris over the legal challenge presented by the Texas Attorney General’s Office. The significant ruling has paved the way for the deployment of a landmark guaranteed income program, setting a precedent for community support mechanisms in Texas.\nUplift Harris, a vision actualized by Commissioner Ellis, is a response to the escalating needs of struggling households. The program promises a financial uplift of $500 monthly to 1,900 families across selected Harris County ZIP codes for 18 months. The funds, devoid of spending restrictions, aim to relieve financial strains by allowing families the freedom to allocate resources for essentials — be it housing, healthcare, or sustenance.\nAs the judicial blockade crumbles, Commissioner Ellis celebrates the victory for those ensnared in financial hardship. “Today’s ruling is a beacon of hope for the many seniors, workers, and families ensnared by poverty’s relentless grip,” he asserts. His statement is a resounding endorsement of the communal spirit, a rebuke against the state’s efforts to halt the program on constitutional grounds, and a commitment to the continued fight for economic justice in Harris County.\nThis resolute stand against the opposition signals a broader mission: to fortify and champion equitable growth and support systems that cater to the unmet needs of the community. With an eye on the long game and prepared to advance the case to the Texas Supreme Court, if necessary, Commissioner Ellis and his team stand as sentinels for the rights and welfare of Harris County’s most vulnerable, ensuring that Uplift Harris serves as more than just a program — it’s a promise of a brighter, more secure future for many.\nFor more info, visit\nhcp1.net/CommissionerEllis.

    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously disclosed, on May 25, 2023, Embark Technology, Inc. (\"Embark\") and Applied Intuition, Inc. (\"Applied\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which, among other matters, Azara Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Embark, with Embark continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Applied (the \"Merger\").\nOn June 26, 2023, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (\"Court\") by Marceil A. Hanshew, a stockholder of Embark (\"Plaintiff\"), against Embark and the then-members of Embark's Board of Directors (collectively, \"Defendants\"), captioned Marceil A. Hanshew v. Embark Technology, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 2023-0654-NAC (the \"Action\"). The complaint alleged that the disclosures made in the preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on June 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger, contained false and misleading statements. The complaint sought, among other forms of relief, a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Merger.\nOn June 26, 2023, Embark filed a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC (\"Proxy\"), and on June 29, 2023, Plaintiff and Plaintiff's spouse, David L. Hanshew (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), filed an amended complaint captioned David L. Hanshew in His Capacity as Attorney-in-Fact for Marceil A. Hanshew and Marceil A. Hanshew v. Embark Technology, Inc. et al., C.A. No. 2023-0654-NAC.\nTo resolve the Action, Plaintiffs and Defendants ultimately agreed that Embark would make certain additional disclosures, which Embark made in Amendment No. 1 to the Proxy filed with the SEC on July 10, 2023 (the \"July 10 Amendment\").\nOn August 1, 2023, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the Action as moot, and later that day, the Court entered a stipulated order dismissing the Action with prejudice as to the Plaintiffs and without prejudice as to any actual or potential claims of any other member(s) of the putative class. The Court retained jurisdiction solely for the purpose of adjudicating Plaintiffs' counsel's anticipated application for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses in connection with the disclosures in the July 10 Amendment.\nIn order to avoid the time and expense of continued litigation, Applied, as successor in interest of Embark, subsequently agreed to pay $114,000 to Plaintiffs' counsel for attorneys' fees and expenses in full satisfaction of their claim for attorneys' fees and expenses in the Action. On December 21, 2023, the Court entered an order closing the case, subject to Applied filing an affidavit with the Court confirming that this notice has been issued. In entering the order, the Court was not asked to review, and did not pass judgment on, the payment of the attorneys' fees and expenses or their reasonableness.\nView original content:\nSOURCE Applied Intuition, Inc.",

Please,\" the chat bot wrote.\n[Character.AI announces new safety measures after teen's tragic suicide](https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/characterai-announces-new-safety-measures-766821)[Florida teen dies by suicide after falling in love with 'Game of Thrones' AI chatbot](https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/florida-teen-dies-suicide-after-765635)\nThe 29-year-old grad student was using the AI chat-bot for help with his homework when it sent the threatening message. He was sitting next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, at the time and told CBS News that they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"\n\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" Reddy told the outlet. \"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment.\"\nGoogle told CBS News that the company filters responses from Gemini to prevent any disrespectful, sexual, or violent messages as well as dangerous discussions or encouraging harmful acts.\n\"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring,\" the tech company said in a statement to the outlet.\nGoogle described the message as \"non-sensical,\" but Reddy contends that this could have been a lot worse if somebody in a already compromised mental state was sent that message encouraging the to harm themselves.\n\"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.\nGoogle has previously come under scrutiny for their Gemini AI chat bot sending potentially harmful responses. Earlier this year in July reporters found that Gemini had given incorrect information in response to medical questions. Gemini is not the only AI chat bot that has sent returned concerning repossess, as a woman in Florida is suing Character.AI, as well as Google, for allegedly driving her 14-year-old son to suicide.\nIf in the United States, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or go to 988 Lifeline\nFor emotional support you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email [jo@samaritans.org](mailto:jo@samaritans.org), visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: [Sign up here](https://www.themirror.com/newsletter-preference-centre/?view=Solus&mailingListId=ab05ec34-5eed-44b8-861e-5fa7078535c3&utm_source=solusarticle) to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.",

    "text": "4月15日，在赴吉隆坡对马来西亚进行国事访问之际，国家主席习近平在马来西亚《星洲日报》《星报》《阳光日报》发表题为《让中马友谊之船驶向更加美好的未来》的署名文章。\n　　马来西亚各界人士在接受新华社记者采访时表示，习近平主席在署名文章中围绕战略引领、务实合作、人文交流、多边协作等方面展开论述，深刻指出中马是安危与共、荣辱与共、患难与共的命运共同体。他们深刻认同习近平主席的重要主张，愿与中方一道推动两国友谊之船行稳致远，共同开辟发展、壮大、繁荣的美好前景。\n　　友好情谊“切水不断”\n　　“刊登习近平主席署名文章，对我们来说是莫大殊荣。”《星洲日报》总编辑陈汉光说，习近平主席回顾马中世代情谊，指出两国务实合作成果丰硕，期许双方团结合作共应挑战，“全文大气磅礴，内涵深刻，让人读后有所思、有所悟”。\n　　中国唐代义净法师首次用文字记载下古吉打王国历史、明代航海家郑和5次到访马六甲、马来西亚南侨机工帮助打通滇缅公路生命线……习近平主席在署名文章中强调，中马“‘切水不断’的世代情谊随着历史演进愈益深厚”。“习近平主席用马来西亚谚语‘切水不断’形容两国世代情谊，非常贴切。”马来西亚前交通部长廖中莱说，中国始终秉持亲诚惠容周边外交理念，与马来西亚平等交往，这是马中关系能够长足发展、成为地区内国家关系典范的重要原因。\n　　“有福同享、有难同当”，习近平主席这样阐述中马命运共同体的真谛。马来西亚国会议员、区域策略研究所主席李健聪对此深有感触：“面对金融危机、地震、疫情等挑战，马中两国始终同舟共济，在相互驰援中不断增进理解和信任。面对当前变乱交织的世界，两国应继续巩固深化双边关系，共同应对新变化新挑战。”\n　　马来西亚种植及原产业部副部长陈泓缣说，近年来，马中两国高层互访不断，马来西亚最高元首易卜拉欣2024年对中国进行国事访问，总理安瓦尔就任以来三次访华。“相信习近平主席此访将推动两国关系达到新的高度。”陈泓缣指出，习近平主席提出的构建人类命运共同体理念和安瓦尔总理提出的“昌明大马”执政理念，都强调多元包容和共同发展，期待两国在各领域加强共同探索。\n　　认真研读习近平主席署名文章后，马来西亚汉文化中心主席吴恒灿心情激动，久久不能平静。“中国一直致力于与周边国家和平共处，在相互尊重的基础上开展互利合作，实现文明互鉴。马中共建命运共同体得到马来西亚人民大力支持。我们对马中关系的未来充满信心，一定会一天比一天更好。”\n　　务实合作硕果累累\n　　推进高质量共建“一带一路”，加强产业链供应链合作，重点推动数字经济、绿色经济、蓝色经济、旅游经济合作……习近平主席在署名文章中强调，要厚载务实合作的压舱石。马方人士认为，习近平主席为进一步深化两国互利合作指明方向，必将给两国人民带来更多福祉。\n　　“马来西亚十分珍视同中国的合作。”马来西亚经济部长拉菲齐·拉姆利说：“我认为目前两国经贸关系处于历史最好时期。这些年，中国在马来西亚开展的合作项目越来越多，给马来西亚带来宝贵、广阔的发展机遇。”\n　　习近平主席在署名文章中提及马中关丹产业园区这一合作项目。产业园运营方北部湾控股（马来西亚）有限公司投资发展总监陈卓理认为，这对他们既是荣誉也是责任。马中互利共赢合作体现在人才培养等很多具体层面。“许多马来西亚本地员工进入项目工作后，接触到高标准的管理体系，还有机会和专业团队深度合作，眼界和能力都得到快速提升。”\n　　《阳光日报》总编辑扎姆里·兰布利说，中国企业在马来西亚大力投资，带来了马中关丹产业园、东海岸铁路等合作项目，马来西亚将中国视为重要贸易伙伴。同时，“比亚迪、奇瑞、小鹏等中国电动汽车品牌正在赢得马来西亚民众的信任，越来越多出现在马来西亚的公路上”。\n　　“习近平主席在署名文章中说：‘马来西亚鲜食榴莲一天之内就可以从果园运送到中国超市，深受中国老百姓喜爱。’我们从业者对此十分兴奋，对两国行业跨国合作充满信心。”马来西亚国际榴莲产业发展联合会秘书长张健豪说：“马来西亚榴莲成熟后会自然落果，两到三天内香气更浓郁，口感最佳。我希望，今年马来西亚鲜食榴莲将出现在更多中国消费者的餐桌上。”\n　　马来西亚双威大学经济学教授姚金龙注意到，习近平主席在署名文章中提出加强产业链供应链合作。姚金龙认为，“这正是两国合作的新趋势”，将助力马方现代化进程。他说，近年来中方对马投资增长显著，已扩展至高新技术与现代服务业领域，包括电动汽车、电商、物流和金融服务等。“我们十分欢迎中国企业来马投资兴业，中企为马来西亚产业升级作出卓越贡献。”\n　　习近平主席在署名文章中强调人文交流的重要性，指出“要划好人文交流的船桨”“增进彼此特别是青年一代相知相亲”。马来西亚高等教育部长赞比里·阿卜杜勒·卡迪尔对此深有同感：“越早培养青年一代相互了解和信任，两国未来的合作基础就越牢固。”他说，当前双方正共同推进文明对话等项目，鼓励青年群体交流互访。期待习近平主席此访进一步推动两国在高等教育、技术培训和科研创新等方面的合作，开启马中教育合作新篇章。\n　　“习近平主席在署名文章中提及‘马来西亚，亚洲魅力所在’这句广告语，相信将吸引更多中国朋友来马旅游。作为旅游从业者，我感到非常兴奋！”马中民俗文旅总商会会长廖利女说：“马中互免签证政策让‘说走就走’的旅行成为可能。可以说，人文交流不断升温为马中关系注入更多活力，为两国未来合作打下坚实基础。”\n　　多边协作面向未来\n　　“我们要扬起多边协作的风帆”“要维护多边贸易体制，维护全球产业链供应链稳定，维护开放合作的国际环境”……习近平主席在署名文章中的这些论述，引发马方人士共鸣。\n　　“维护多边贸易体制正是我们一直以来坚持的。当前，全球经济呈现关税壁垒增多、保护主义上升的态势，但我们不能随波逐流。”马来西亚努桑塔拉战略研究院高级研究员阿兹米·哈桑说，马中两国都是经济全球化和多边主义的受益者、贡献者和坚定维护者，“我们始终呼吁区域合作，希望从开放、自由的全球经贸体系中获益”。\n　　习近平主席在署名文章中指出，中国全力支持马来西亚履职2025年东盟轮值主席国，期待马来西亚作为中国东盟关系协调国更好发挥桥梁作用，并强调推动高水平战略性中马命运共同体破浪前行，携手打造更为紧密的中国－东盟命运共同体。\n　　马来西亚科技与创新部长郑立慷对此表示，期待习近平主席此访进一步强化东盟与中国的关系。马来西亚致力于推动建设更具前瞻性的东盟－中国关系，以有效应对全球性挑战。马来西亚支持区域一体化，希望在贸易、投资、科技、可持续发展等关键领域加强对华合作。\n　　“从习近平主席的署名文章中，我感受到中国同国际社会团结协作的开放姿态和强烈意愿。”老挝资深外交官西昆·本伟莱说，随着区域经济合作进一步深化，东盟国家与中国将迎来更广阔合作空间与发展机遇，携手向可持续和包容性发展阔步前进。\n　　印度尼西亚大学经济商业学院院长特古·达尔坦托说，正如习近平主席所指出的，中国东盟合作在区域合作中最务实、最富有成果。双方在各领域合作不断深化，丰硕成果惠及广大民众。未来双方可持续拓展人文等领域合作空间，加深彼此理解，促进民心相通。“我们正在携手成长，向着一个更加包容、繁荣的未来奋斗迈进。”\n　　习近平主席在署名文章中强调，中国“将继续推动高质量发展，扩大高水平对外开放，同各国分享发展机遇”。马来西亚中国公共关系协会副会长颜天禄就此表示，中国式现代化对广大发展中国家具有重要借鉴意义。习近平主席提出全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，与世界分享机遇、共同发展，得到广大发展中国家积极响应，“为充满不确定性的世界注入稳定力量”。新华社",
