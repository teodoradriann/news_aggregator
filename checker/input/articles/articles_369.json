In comparison, following administration of the same chemotherapy (but without SCB-219M) in the same cancer patients prior to enrolling into the trial, all evaluable patients had observed platelet counts drop to 9 /L between one and three weeks. The durable preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile observed for SCB-219M are potentially supportive of dosing intervals â‰¥2-weeks. If further confirmed, this profile could enable convenient dosing of SCB-219M synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen, typically 2-3 weeks per cycle. A favorable safety and tolerability profile for SCB-219M has also been observed to-date, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified.\nDr. Yongsheng Wang , Associate Director of West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University and Principal Investigator for the SCB-219M Phase â… Trial commented: \"We are encouraged by the Phase â… results to-date for SCB-219M, and we look forward to the continued evaluation of SCB-219M, as we believe the management of CIT remains a pressing unmet medical need for patients undergoing cancer treatment.\"\n\"We are pleased to announce positive Phase â… results for SCB-219M demonstrating rapid and durable efficacy along with a favorable safety profile,\" said Dr. Peng Liang , Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer of Clover and inventor of SCB-219M. \"The preliminary results suggest that SCB-219M has a potentially differentiated profile compared to the current standard of care treatments for CIT and CTIT. In contrast to current biologic treatment options for CIT in China requiring daily injections [1] and globally requiring weekly injections [2] , the durable efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCB-219M observed to-date could enable convenient dosing synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen.\"\nThe Phase â… trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study, that is exploring the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SCB-219M administered subcutaneously in cancer patients with CIT. In addition to West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University, other participating sites in this clinical trial include Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and Chengdu No. 6 People's Hospital. A Phase â… b trial evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M in CIT and CTIT patients is planned to initiate in 2024.\nCIT is a serious, chemotherapy-associated complication observed in a wide range of cancer patients. Incidence of CIT can occur in greater than 50% [3] of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy regiments, and can have detrimental impacts on treatment outcome, resulting in chemotherapy dose delay or dose reduction, and potentially fatal bleeding events.\n1.

    "text": "Report from January 2, 2023\nYesterday morning we got out early-ish and started digging up a long flat trail into a zone I’d never been to in the Wasatch Mountains, UT.\nThe stats are kinda fun:\n- 4,700-vertical-feet\n- 5 hours & 20 minutes to the top\n- 7 hours & 40 minutes round trip\n- 9.8 miles round trip\nIt’s real simple how I got here:\n- Saw a line while hiking up Superior – detoured and skied it\n- Saw a line from the top of that line then went and skied it\n- Saw this line from the top of that line and skied it\n- Now, I’ve seen some more lines I’d like to ski…\nI feel like I’m finally seeing the Wasatch for the first time and I’m impressed.\nGranted, you likely couldn’t ski many of these zones I’ve been in in anything but LOW avalanche danger…\nThere isn’t much snow in the Wasatch right now, but if you are willing to scratch n’ sniff, there’s a world of opportunity out there.\nHiking by 8am.\nFinally in the ‘alpine’ after 3 hours of hiking.\nSwitched to booting up in ascent plates after 4.5 hours.\nTight chute to wide open fields of glory to tight chute to ridgeline.\nFinally on top of the ridge after 5 hours & 20 minutes of hiking.\nYou gotta really want it to get it right now…\nOn the hike up the recrystallized snow felt terrific.\n2-6″ deep delicious Alaskan Velvet.\nIt also felt like it was gonna sluff like a freight train.\nI envisioned every grain of recrystallized pow I touched training together and making huge, life-threatening sluffs chomping at my heels as I screamed down the mountain.\nAfter taking in the view and imbibing some dihydrogen monoxide, I dropped in.\nI’d decided I was gonna ski like an a**hole and try to beat my sluff down the chute.\nFull throttle.\nI held confidence in the snow quality and I knew if I got going too fast in the upper chute, I could likely point it and dump my speed in the fields of glory before committing to the 2nd chute.\nThe snow in the upper chute was good.\nI was just able to keep my speed under control in the upper chute.\nI blasted out into the fields of glory where the snow was exquisite and was easily able to speed check and get ready for chute #2.\nChute #2 held funkier snow with the worst snow being in the tightest choke, of course…\nI kept the speed up as high as I could as I chopped turns into the crusty snow culminating in a short straightline to get through the 2′ wide choke at the bottom of the chute.\nA big line like this ending in a tight chute with a 2′ wide choke?\nYeah, you’re only gonna have the confidence to ski a line like this on a very LOW avalanche danger day – which yesterday was, thankfully.\nI pointed it through the 2′ wide choke, battled the firm crust below it, and dumped my speed down and to the right where the snow turned back into near surface facet goodness.\nFrom there it was another 90-seconds of skiing down to the flats.\nI spun to a stop, gasping for breath, and said “That was sick!”\nThen, “So tired…”\n1,500-vertical-feel of Hell-Yeah!\nI watched as Martin & Dr. Joe shredded down an alternate chute on the top then down through the same 2nd chute as me.\nThey were pumped.\nWe celebrated with hugs and pole taps and “That was epic!s”.\nWe did some fun meadow skipping, rock dodging, and river gorge traversing before committing to the bushwhack that would be our reality for the next 30-minutes.\nIt was a touch mellower than the bushwhack ski on Twin Peaks 2 days prior so it didn’t hurt my feelings too much.\nI was happy to see our shoes.\nShoes on, down the trail, conversation high.\n7 hours & 41 minutes after leaving the cars, we were back safe and sound.\nWe exchanged hugs and gratitude and scattered in 3 directions.\nI headed home and ate:\n- Protein, creatine, l-glutamine, banana, peanut butter, blueberry, raspberry, almond milk smoothie\n- Full apres tea dinner\n- Split burger, truffle fries, and tomato brisk with Miss Erica\n- Margarita\n- Chocolate cookie dough ice cream\n- Brownie\nI writing this from a plane headed to British Columbia for our annual BC hut trip there.\nAs I gaze out the window I realize that I’ve never seen the Northern Rockies of the USA look so dry this time of year.\nFingers crossed for good snow and great times with some old friends trapped in a hut in the middle of nowhere for a week in some of the best ski terrain in the world.\nThanks, Utah!",

    "text": "Cynthia Erivo accused of ‘blasphemy’ after being cast as Jesus Christ in musical production\nErivo's casting as the Messiah angered many, with one furious commenter posting: \"Jesus is a MAN not a woman!!!\"\nBy\nGary Grimes\nWicked star Cynthia Erivo has received criticism from Christians after news of her casting as Jesus Christ himself has come to light.\nThe actress and singer, who is currently nominated for Best Actress at the upcoming Oscars for her performance in the blockbuster musical adaptation, took to her Instagram story to reveal her casting in an upcoming production of Jesus Christ Superstar, writing: “Just a little busy this summer. Can’t wait!”\nThe star had previously performed as Mary Magdalene as part of an all-female cast recording of the musical for the album She Is Risen, but this time she will be playing the titular lord and saviour. The production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical will run for just three nights at the Hollywood Bowl from 1 – 3 August 2025.\nErivo, who identifies as bisexual, is already facing backlash for her role in the show from religious zealots who object to a queer woman playing the role of Jesus Christ.\n“Jesus is a MAN not a woman!!!” wrote one worked up Instagram user in the comments beneath the Hollywood Bowl’s post announcing Erivo’s casting as Christ.\n“Absolute blasphemy,” another user wrote. “May god be merciful to those who taunt him, and disobey his word. for you are lost, and i will pray for you to be found. We still love you but this is unacceptable as a Christian.”\nEchoing their sentiments, another user agreed, writing: “I am absolutely disgusted at just how demonic it’s become and how willing people like yourself are willing to blaspheme, degrade, insult and shit on billions of Christian’s – if you really want to push the envelope why don’t you portray Mohammed and let’s see how that’s received.”\nThe actress recently spoke out about how she believes her Wicked character Elphaba’s green skin makes her “the ultimate other,” and how she related to this as a Black queer woman.\n“The green skin is like the umbrella under which the ‘other’ lives,” she told Another magazine. “So yes, it’s a conversation about racism, but it’s also a conversation about anyone who’s been othered. It’s a conversation about queerness.\n“The green sets Elphaba apart from everybody else. She is the ultimate other. And I think there’s this added responsibility because I’m a Black woman underneath that green, so we can also really have the conversation about what it’s like to be a Black woman when nobody wants you there. I mean, you’re gonna have a frank conversation.”",

    "title": "Heavy snow recorded in many areas of southern Alberta | CTV News",
    "text": "After enjoying spring-like temperatures for more than a week, Calgary and southern Alberta are in the midst of another bout of winter with lots of snow. Environment and Climate Change Canada says as of Friday morning, 23 centimetres of snow was recorded at the Calgary International Airport, the most at any of its weather stations in Alberta. In its preliminary weather report , the agency said periods of heavy snow fell in many regions of Alberta beginning on Tuesday night through to Thursday evening. Some other significant accumulations were recorded at weather stations in Sundre (18 centimetres), Brooks (15 centimetres), Medicine Hat (15 centimetres) and Lethbridge (14 centimetres). The agency says more snow could be coming over the weekend, but it's only expected to be for brief periods. CTV Calgary weather specialist Jodi Hughes says its unclear how much more snow the city could see over the next couple of days. \"The synoptic setup with an upsloping flow will continue – pushing moisture back into the foothills due to the counter-clockwise circulation of a low pressure system positioned over southern Alberta and B.C.. More snow will impact southern Alberta Friday and Saturday - the area of disagreement comes in how far north the snow will land,\" she said. Some of the models are forecasting minimal amounts, she says, while others see another heavy band of snow hitting Calgary. \"These are very difficult scenarios to forecast for due to our location near the Rocky Mountains. \"I have forecast three to five centimetres for Calgary today and another five to eight centimetres Saturday – with the reasoning that it is better to be prepared for snow and pleasantly surprised if we over-estimate, compared to forecasting no snow and being unprepared.\" More weather information and forecasts can be found on our weather page .

    "text": "Genf. Gewalttätige Konflikte und Bürgerkriege treiben weiterhin weltweit Hunderttausende in die Flucht, aber das UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk (UNHCR) kann erstmals seit Jahren einen positiven Trend vermelden. Mehr Vertriebene sind 2024 in ihre Heimat zurückgekehrt als in früheren Jahren, wie es im Weltflüchtlingsbericht heißt.\nUnter den Rückkehrern waren 1,6 Millionen Menschen, die ins Ausland geflüchtet waren. Dies sei in dieser Kategorie die höchste Zahl seit mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten gewesen, so das UNHCR. Die anderen Rückkehrer waren im eigenen Land vertrieben gewesen. In dieser Kategorie war es die zweithöchste Zahl seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen.\nWelches Land die meisten Rückkehrer hat\nDie positive Entwicklung ging auch in den ersten Monaten dieses Jahres weiter. Vor allem Syrer traten nach dem Sturz des Assad-Regimes in Damaskus im Dezember 2024 die Reise in die Heimat an, wie UNHCR-Chef Filippo Grandi mitteilte. Insgesamt seien bereits fast zwei Millionen Syrer in das einstige Bürgerkriegsland zurückgekehrt.\nSo ist die Gesamtzahl der Flüchtlinge weltweit mit Stichtag Ende April im Jahresvergleich kaum gestiegen. Es waren 122 Millionen Menschen, fast genau so viele wie ein Jahr zuvor (120 Millionen). Die Zahlen umfassen sowohl Vertriebene im eigenen Land als auch die, die in andere Länder geflohen sind. Rund 60 Prozent sind jeweils Binnenvertriebene. Von den anderen leben rund Zweidrittel nach UNHCR-Angaben in Nachbarländern ihrer Heimat.\nBezogen auf das Gesamtjahr 2024 stieg die Zahl der Vertriebenen allerdings im Vergleich zum Vorjahr um 7 Millionen auf 123,2 Millionen.\nWelches Land die meisten Vertriebenen hat\nSchon Ende 2024 waren nicht mehr Syrer die größte Gruppe von Vertriebenen, sondern Menschen aus dem Sudan. Insgesamt 14,3 Millionen Menschen hatten dort wegen des Machtkampfs zwischen der Regierung und Rebellen fliehen müssen. Syrier waren die zweitgrößte Gruppe mit 13,5 Millionen, gefolgt von Afghanen (10,3 Millionen) und Ukrainern (8,8 Millionen).\n«Die Suche nach Frieden muss im Mittelpunkt aller Bemühungen stehen, langfristige dauerhafte Lösungen für Flüchtlinge und andere Menschen zu finden, die gezwungen sind, aus ihrer Heimat zu fliehen», meinte Grandi.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250612-930-658477/1\nURL dieses Artikels:\nhttps://www.fnweb.de/startseite_artikel,-politik-unhcr-syrien-rueckkehrer-lichtblick-in-fluechtlingsstatistik-_arid,2309943.html",

    "title": "Preity Zinta Rejected Doing A Film With Irrfan Khan Backed By Vishal Bhardwaj?",
    "text": "Preity Zinta Rejected Doing A Film With Irrfan Khan Backed By Vishal Bhardwaj?\nPreity Zinta Once Turned Down a Film With Irrfan Khan, Reveals Vishal Bhardwaj\nBollywood’s casting decisions often remain a mystery, with many iconic roles initially meant for different actors. In a surprising revelation, filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj disclosed that Preity Zinta was the original choice for Ishqiya (2010), but she walked away from the project. The reason? She reportedly wasn’t convinced about Irrfan Khan’s commercial appeal as a lead actor.\nDirected by Abhishek Chaubey, Ishqiya became a cult classic, with Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, and Naseeruddin Shah delivering stellar performances. However, the film’s casting went through a major overhaul before it hit the screens.\nAccording to a Koimoi report, Pankaj Tripathi was initially set to play Khalujan (eventually portrayed by Naseeruddin Shah), and Irrfan Khan was supposed to take on the role of Babban (later played by Arshad Warsi). The female lead, Krishna Verma, was first offered to Preity Zinta, who reportedly loved the script. However, she had concerns about Irrfan’s ability to pull in audiences commercially, leading to her exit.\nInterestingly, Irrfan Khan himself did not end up doing Ishqiya, but for a completely different reason. In an interview with News18, director Abhishek Chaubey recalled a meeting with Irrfan at a hotel in New York, where the actor realized that the revised version of the script didn’t favour his character as much as he had initially believed.\n“Irrfan heard the new version of the film and sensed that this version isn’t in favour of his character. That was the first time I realized he might not do my film,” Chaubey revealed.\nThis led to a fallout between Irrfan Khan and Vishal Bhardwaj, who had been close collaborators. Reportedly, Bhardwaj was so upset that he did not speak to Irrfan for nearly three years.\nIn an interview with Lallantop, Vishal Bhardwaj indirectly addressed the situation, seemingly confirming that a major actress had refused the film because she didn’t believe in Irrfan’s commercial viability. Without naming Preity Zinta, he stated:\n“We had said no to a big actress for Ishqiya because she refused to work with Irrfan, as he wasn’t a commercial actor. I got very angry with him and didn’t speak to him for 2-3 years. I didn’t pick up his calls.”\nThis aligns with reports suggesting that Bhardwaj ultimately chose Irrfan over Preity, leading to a complete casting reshuffle.\nWith Preity Zinta out of the picture, the role eventually went to Vidya Balan, who delivered one of her most career-defining performances. Her bold and layered portrayal of Krishna Verma was widely praised, proving that the right casting can elevate a film. Ishqiya not only became a box-office success but also helped establish Vidya as a force to be reckoned with in Bollywood.\nStay informed on all the latest news, real-time breaking news updates, and follow all the important headlines in india news and world News on Zee News.\nLive Tv",

    "text": "Steel unions call on government to secure future of Scunthorpe Steel\nThe Chinese owners of British Steel are launching a consultation on closing the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe\nLast updated 53 minutes ago\nUnions are calling on the government to secure the future of steelmaking in Northern Lincolnshire, following the news that British Steel's owner is launching a fresh consultation on closing Scunthorpe's blast furnaces.\nJingye, who operate British Steel, will launch their consultation in June, or at a later date, should an agreement with the UK government be reached.\nScunthorpe steelworks is the UK's last remaining primary steelmaking facility, and employs thousands of people directly and through extensive supply chains throughout the UK.\nA statement on behalf of Jingye says since 2020, they have invested more than £1.2 bn to maintain operations at British Steel, amid ongoing production instability and significant financial losses of around £700k a day.\nInvestments to date include over £300m in strategic capital projects such as a state-of-the-art mast service centre in Skinningrove, a rail stocking facility and a new billet caster.\nDespite this, the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations are no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\nSteel unions Community, GMB and Unite are coming together to call on the government for support.\nCommunity General Secretary Roy Rickhuss CBE said:\n\"This is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country. We urge Jingye and the UK Government to get back around the table to resume negotiations before it is too late.\"\n\"Cruciallly, Jingye have not ruled out retaining the blast furnaces during a transition to low carbon steelmaking if they can secure the backing of the Government.\"\n\"If the government chooses to let Scunthorpe die it would make a mockery of their grand ambitions to deliver growth through massive infrastructure investment, because British Steel is our only steelmaker than can produce the construction steels the country needs for our roads, railways, schools and hospitals.\"\nLinda McCulloch, National Officer for Unite the Union, said:\n\"This is devastating news and there is now a duty on the Government to do everything it can to prevent a catastrophic outcome. As the last primary steelmaking facility in the UK, Scunthorpe is a vital strategic asset which we cannot afford to lose.\"\nCharlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB National Officer, said:\n“This is devastating news for the people of Scunthorpe and the whole of UK steelmaking.\n“But it’s not too late: we urge Jingye and the government to do everything in their power to save this vital domestic industry.”\nHear the latest news on Clyde 1 on FM, DAB, smart speaker or the Rayo app.",

    "title": "Congress sounds poll bugle at Nagpur rally",
    "text": "Kharge warns democracy will be finished if BJP, RSS not stopped Mumbai: Sounding the bugle for the 2024 general election, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said that the coming polls will be a “battle of two ideologies” as “slavery” works in the BJP. He also promised a nationwide caste census if the Congress was voted to power at the Centre. Addressing a “Hai Taiyyar Hum” rally in Nagpur that kickstarted the Congress’ campaign for next year’s Lok Sabha polls, Mr Gandhi lashed out at the ruling BJP, saying the saffron party is run on an authoritarian ideology like that of erstwhile kings. “There is a fight of ideologies going on in the country. Their (BJP) ideology is the ideology of kings. They don’t listen to anyone, orders just come from above. Whereas in the Congress, the voices come from below, our small workers can point out the big leaders. I listen to our workers and also respect their voice (concerns),” Mr Gandhi said. The freedom struggle was not fought by the kings or rulers of that time, it was fought by the people of the country. Kings and rulers had a partnership with the British. The Congress fought against that partnership for the people of the country, he added. “Vice-chancellors are appointed not on the basis of merit but because they belong to a particular organisation. Unemployment is highest now in the last 40 years,” Mr Gandhi stated. The Congress leader also announced that his party will undertake a caste census if voted to power at the Centre. “We will undertake a caste census after coming to power at Centre, he said. After the Congress made a demand for a caste census, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s language changed and he started saying poverty was the only caste in the country. The Congress will carry out the caste census and give employment to youths, who are deprived of jobs, Mr Gandhi added. The Congress leader also said the BJP wants to take the country back to slavery, alleging that “ghulami” (slavery) works in the saffron party. “A few days ago, I secretly met a BJP MP in the Lok Sabha, who was previously in the Congress. He spoke out of fear, and tension was visible on his face. He said: “BJP mein ghulami chalti hai” (slavery works in the BJP), said the Congress leader. “The BJP leader said that whatever directions are received from the authorities above have to be followed without thinking twice. No one listens to us, orders come from above. It is just like how kings used to give orders earlier and everyone had to follow it. There is no choice whether you like it or not,” Mr Gandhi said. Addressing the rally, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the RSS and BJP have ruined the country in the last 10 years and if they are not stopped now, then democracy will be finished. The BJP made a mockery of democracy by suspending 146 Opposition MPs for asking questions and passing the bills in Parliament. The people should teach a lesson to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP for not respecting democracy, he added. While Congress’ former president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did not attend the rally, Telangana CM Revanth Reddy, Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhvinder Sukhu, Karnataka deputy CM D.K. Shivakumar, and former Maharashtra CMs Prithviraj Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde and Ashok Chavan were present on the occasion.",
