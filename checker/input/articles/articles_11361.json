    "title": "Beaches in the Monterey County score high grades in summer, says Heal the Bay’s 2024 report – Monterey Herald",
    "text": "Beaches in Monterey County scored high in water quality during the summer, according to this year’s edition of Heal the Bay’s 34th annual “ Beach Report Card ,” which was released on Wednesday. Heal the Bay , a Santa Monica-based environment nonprofit, releases the annual report that examines the amount of pollution at beaches along the West Coast to help keep people safe when visiting the beach. The “Beach Report Card” utilizes an A-to-F grading system to communicate water quality to the public. While A or B grades indicate good water quality for recreational use, C to F grades mean increased health risks, according to the report. The grades are split into three seasonal categories, including summer dry, wet weather and winter dry. “I’m excited to announce that once again, during the summer when most people are in the water, 90% of our West Coast beaches were safe to swim in 2023,” said Heal the Bay President and CEO Tracy Quinn at a press conference on Wednesday. This year’s report graded more than 500 beaches in California. Monterey County’s beaches received all A’s for Summer Dry grades, which is better than average according to the report. Wet Weather Grades were also above average with county beaches getting A and B grades. Heal the Bay’s scores saw a drop during the winter dry and wet weather periods coastal counties, because California received 31% more rainfall than the 10-year average during the winter. The report said Monterey County does not monitor its beaches in winter months so no Winter Dry Grades were generated. “L.A. County received 23 inches of rain, and while we celebrate rain here in Southern California, our highly developed landscape turned rain into polluted urban runoff,” said Annelisa Moe, associate director of science and policy and water quality at Heal the Bay. “This unfortunately led to particularly poor grades this year during our winter season.” Sewage spills and inadequate infrastructure is also an issue for water quality at beaches, Moe said. Monterey County’s 36 spills sent 2,986 gallons of sewage into waterways across the county. Los Angeles County saw 185 sewage spills totaling approximately 9 million gallons, a stark increase from the 330,396 gallons reported the previous year, according to the report. In February, about 8 million gallons of raw waste entered the Dominguez Channel, subsequently affecting Cabrillo Beach and necessitating beach closures . The report is available at healthebay.org . The Monterey Herald contributed to this report.",

    "title": "L'FBI mette in guardia contro l'uso degli SMS nell'autenticazione a due fattori",
    "text": "Negli ultimi anni, l’autenticazione a due fattori o 2FA è diventata uno strumento essenziale per proteggere i propri account online, aggiungendo un livello di sicurezza aggiuntivo rispetto alla semplice combinazione di username e password. Tuttavia, non tutti i metodi di 2FA sono ugualmente sicuri, e l’[FBI](https://www.geopop.it/fbi-e-cia-cosa-fanno-e-in-cosa-differiscono-le-2-maggiori-agenzie-di-intelligence-degli-usa/) (Federal Bureau of Investigation) ha recentemente emesso un avvertimento significativo: smettere di utilizzare gli [SMS](https://www.geopop.it/il-primo-sms-della-storia-diceva-merry-christmas-e-fu-inviato-nel-1992-da-un-computer/) come mezzo di verifica, in quanto giudicati poco sicuri. Questa raccomandazione arriva dopo una delle più gravi violazioni di sicurezza nella storia degli Stati Uniti, attribuita al gruppo Salt Typhoon, presunto “braccio operativo” del governo cinese, che ha dimostrato quanto siano vulnerabili le reti di telecomunicazione e ha sollevato preoccupazioni globali sulla sicurezza dei dati. Anche la CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), sconsiglia l'uso degli SMS come strumento di verifica, giudicandolo come «non resistente al phishing». Molto meglio optare per soluzioni più sicure, come app di autenticazione, chiavi di sicurezza FIDO o sistemi di passkey, pensati per resistere anche agli attacchi più sofisticati.\nIl problema degli SMS secondo l'FBI e la minaccia degli attacchi phishing\nL’autenticazione a due fattori tramite SMS prevede l’invio di un codice temporaneo via messaggio di testo al numero di telefono dell’utente. Questo metodo, pur essendo indubbiamente molto pratico, presenta vulnerabilità significative. I messaggi di testo non sono crittografati, il che significa che possono essere intercettati da attori malintenzionati con accesso alle reti di telecomunicazione.\nSecondo Yashin Manraj, esperto di sicurezza informatica, il rischio principale non risiede solo nell’intercettazione dei codici, ma anche nella facilità con cui gli utenti cadono vittime di attacchi di [phishing](https://www.geopop.it/la-truffa-delle-email-cose-il-phishing-e-come-evitarlo/). Al sito NewsNation ha infatti [dichiarato](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/fbi-warns-against-using-two-factor-text-authentication/):\nIn termini di SMS, la preoccupazione più grande non è l'autenticazione a due fattori, ma il fatto che le persone cliccano su molti link. Credo che il 60-70% degli hack attivi e riusciti sia dovuto al fatto che le persone sono state in grado di inviare link di phishing che fondamentalmente sono in grado di dirottare le informazioni dell'utente, le informazioni bancarie o l'accesso a infrastrutture più critiche.\nAlternative più sicure alla 2FA via SMS\nPer migliorare la sicurezza, il CISA consiglia di adottare alternative più robuste alla 2FA via SMS. Le app di autenticazione, come Google Authenticator o Microsoft Authenticator, generano codici temporanei direttamente sul dispositivo dell’utente, rendendoli inaccessibili a chiunque non abbia accesso fisico al dispositivo. Un’altra opzione affidabile è rappresentata dall’autenticazione basata su FIDO (Fast IDentity Online), che utilizza chiavi di sicurezza fisiche o tecnologie biometriche per verificare l’identità dell’utente.\nUn altro sistema sicuro è rappresentato dalle sempre più diffuse passkey, che eliminano del tutto la necessità di password “tradizionali”, che basano il loro funzionamento su standard di crittografia avanzati e l'uso dei dati biometrici salvati sul dispositivo, rendendo praticamente impossibile l’accesso non autorizzato agli account, anche in caso di phishing.\nBuone pratiche per proteggere i vostri account\nOltre a scegliere metodi di autenticazione sicuri, il CISA suggerisce alcune fondamentali buone pratiche per proteggere dispositivi e dati personali.\n- Mantenete aggiornati i vostri smartphone e computer con gli ultimi aggiornamenti di sicurezza disponibili.\n- Abilitate la protezione tramite PIN per le SIM e utilizzate password complesse.\n- Usate un gestore di password per creare e memorizzare credenziali uniche e complesse per ogni account, evitando l’uso di combinazioni prevedibili o riutilizzate.\n[non perderti questo articolo ](https://www.geopop.it/e-vero-che-cambiare-spesso-le-password-aumenta-la-sicurezza-informatica-no-secondo-gli-esperti/)",

    "text": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission [ issued several warnings](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/magnetic-ball-recall-warning/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo) for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death. Walmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy. Earlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s [small parts cylinder](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Small-Parts-for-Toys-and-Childrens-Products) (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.” The agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States. The recall affects about 4,240 units. [The CPSC said](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/High-Powered-Magnetic-Balls-Recalled-Due-to-Ingestion-Hazard-Sold-Exclusively-on-Walmart-com-through-Joybuy) customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.

    "text": "Former NFL quarterback and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich is joining the coaching staff under Deion Sanders at Colorado, Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The reports come a day after Leftwich was spotted at practice holding a clipboard and wearing Colorado football gear. Sanders said on Monday Colorado would make \"a couple more huge moves\" this week but has not confirmed Leftwich's hiring. It's unclear what Leftwich's role will be on Sanders' staff. Leftwich interviewed with the New England Patriots for their head coaching post in January. Leftwich, 45, most recently worked as the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2019-22, a stint that included a Super Bowl win in the 2020 season. Leftwich was fired by Bucs head coach Todd Bowles after the 2022 season, which saw Tampa Bay slip from the top 3 in scoring the previous three seasons to No. 15 in yards and No. 25 in points in 2022. A quarterback and first-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2003 NFL Draft, Leftwich had a 24-26 record with 10,532 passing yards and 58 touchdowns in 60 games with the Jaguars (2003-06), Atlanta Falcons (2007), Bucs (2009) and Steelers (2008, 2010, 2012). He also worked in various roles including the interim offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals from 2016-2018. --Field Level Media\nWire\nReport: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\nNews and Info from our Community Partners\nInformation from the News and our advertisers (Want to add your business to this to this feed?)\nSign Up For Newsletters\nSuccess!

    "title": "Binge drinking rewires the brain, increases Alzheimer’s risk even if you quit",
    "text": "HERSHEY, Pa. — Studies have shown that drinking alcohol can have an immediate impact on the human brain. Now, a new report finds that this damage can have lasting consequences, even if you quit drinking for years.\nResearchers from Penn State have discovered that even a modest amount of binge drinking when you’re a young adult can rewire the brain, making it more vulnerable to cognitive decline during old age. Simply put, too much heavy drinking during your college years can have a lasting and devastating impact on the neurons in your brain, even if you stop drinking after this period of your life.\nConducted on mice, the study found that moderate binge drinking in younger years can leave lasting impacts on brain function, affecting how neurons communicate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) — the brain area responsible for high-level processes such as decision-making, memory, and self-control. This new insight, published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, could inform our understanding of how early-life drinking patterns affect brain health in later years.\nIn the study, mice were exposed to voluntary binge drinking over a period of weeks and then abstained from alcohol for about six months — equivalent to several years in human terms. When the researchers examined the mice’s brains after this long abstinence, they observed persistent changes in the PFC neurons.\nSpecifically, neurons in this region became more excitable and had higher levels of excitatory signaling, meaning they fired more often and with less input than usual. In healthy brains, a careful balance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling keeps the system stable, but binge drinking seems to disrupt this balance in a way that lingers, potentially creating an environment similar to early-stage Alzheimer’s.\nOne particularly striking finding was the change in non-pyramidal neurons, a type of cell that typically inhibits overactivity in the brain. After the binge-drinking period, these neurons received a significant increase in excitatory input, almost doubling the amount of stimulatory signals they received. This increase could lead to “hyperexcitability,” where the brain becomes overly active — a hallmark of several neurodegenerative conditions.\nWhile the research was conducted on mice, the implications for human health are worth considering. If similar effects occur in people, it would suggest that even moderate binge drinking in earlier life could create lasting vulnerabilities in the brain’s wiring, potentially increasing the risk of cognitive decline as we age. Importantly, these results underscore the need for further studies in humans to explore how different levels of alcohol consumption interact with brain health and aging.\nPaper Summary\nMethodology\nThe researchers used the Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) model to simulate binge drinking. In this model, mice were given access to 20% alcohol for a few hours over several days, which reliably produced blood alcohol levels similar to binge drinking in humans. Following this four-week drinking period, the mice then abstained from alcohol for about six months. At the end of this abstinence period, the researchers examined the prefrontal cortex, focusing on neuron excitability and signaling. They measured how easily neurons fired signals, looking for shifts in baseline activity and communication patterns within the brain.\nKey Results\nThe study found that after the abstinence period, PFC neurons in previously binge-drinking mice were still hyper-excitable, requiring less stimulus to fire signals. Furthermore, non-pyramidal neurons—cells that typically play a calming role in the brain—were receiving more excitatory input than normal, suggesting a disruption in the brain’s balance between excitement and inhibition. In simple terms, the PFC neurons in these mice had become “trigger-happy,” and non-pyramidal neurons had lost some of their usual calming influence.\nStudy Limitations\nThe research was conducted on mice, and while mouse brains share similarities with human brains, they aren’t identical. Moreover, the DID model forces the mice to drink as their only available reward, unlike humans who have other choices and social factors involved. Finally, single housing for the mice, while necessary for the study, may introduce social stress, which could amplify the effects of alcohol on the brain.\nDiscussion & Takeaways\nThe findings suggest that binge drinking could have long-lasting impacts on brain health, even after years of abstinence. The study reveals how binge drinking could alter brain wiring in ways that resemble early Alzheimer’s, potentially increasing cognitive decline risk in later life. While further research is needed to verify these effects in humans, the study highlights alcohol as a risk factor to consider in brain health, particularly as we age.\nFunding & Disclosures\nThe study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, including grants specifically focused on alcohol research and neurodegeneration. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare, ensuring that the study’s findings are presented without bias.",
