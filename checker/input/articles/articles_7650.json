    "text": "(AUSTRALIA)\nCrux [Denver CO]\nFebruary 23, 2024\nBy Charles Collins\nAustralian Bishop Christopher Saunders has been charged with rape and sex offences, including some with children.\nThe 74-year-old was arrested in Broome on Wednesday, and he has said he will plead not guilty.\nThe bishop is charged with two counts of rape, 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault, and three counts of indecently dealing with a child as a person in authority. The allegations take place between 2008 and 2014. Saunders became bishop in 1996.\nHe’s been released on bail and will appear in court in June. He has been ordered to reside at his home in Broome.\n“Allegations against the former Bishop of Broome, Christopher Saunders are very serious and deeply distressing, especially for those making those allegations,” said Perth Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, the head of the bishops’ conference.\n“It is right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated. The Church will continue to cooperate fully with the police and take every necessary step to avoid any actions which may compromise the integrity and autonomy of the police investigation,” he said in a statement on Thursday.\nSaunders was known for his advocacy work in the diocese, and even had a beer named after him. He was also known for taking young people on camping and fishing trips.\nAllegations were first made against him in 2020, but no charges were made after a police investigation, although Saunders voluntarily resigned from office, becoming bishop emeritus. However, the Vatican launched an investigation in 2022 about child abuse allegations, and a 200-page report was later leaked, and Western Australia police relaunched their investigation.\nIn September, Australia’s 7News\ninterviewed two of the people who accused Saunders of abuse.\nOne man said Saunders offered the use of his shower after he did some gardening for the bishop. The man alleges he was in the shower when the bishop came in with him.\n“He started washing me with soap and shampoo, rubbing me all over my body – in my private part, my front part,” the man told 7News. “I was scared. He was a big fella and I was just a teenager at the time.”\nThe man told the television news service Saunders started giving him cash and presents, and once flew him to Melbourne to see his first game of the AFL and stayed in the same hotel room.\nThe second man told 7News the bishop would get young men drunk and demand they remove their shorts and shirts.\n“I seen him kiss and hug … and touch them in the private parts you know,” he said. “I was really shocked,” adding Saunders’s was “pretty disgusting.”\nOne of the alleged victims told 7News the bishop “should be behind bars or given the sack from the Catholic Church.”",

    "text": "Joseph Madzimure Senior Reporter INTERNATIONAL confidence in Zimbabwe is growing as evidenced by the ongoing United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Conference, as well as the International Renewable Energy Conference which are both taking place in Victoria Falls, President Mnangagwa has said. This comes as Zimbabwe will in August this year host the SADC Summit and assume the chairmanship of the regional body. Addressing the 374th session of the Politburo at the Zanu PF headquarters in Harare yesterday, President Mnangagwa, who is also the party’s First Secretary, said the hosting and overwhelming attendance of such meetings serve as a vote of confidence in Zimbabwe. “Already underway is the UNECA Conference for Ministers of Finance and Economic Development, as well as the International Renewable Energy Conference, at our resort City of Victoria Falls. The hosting and overwhelming attendance of such meetings serve as a vote of confidence in our country,” he said. Ahead of the SADC Summit, President Mnangagwa said preparations for a successful event have begun in earnest. “In this regard, I call upon all party structures to support related events, projects and activities,” he said. The President said his recent participation at various Global Summits highlights the success of the Engagement and Re-Engagement Policy. “The developing trade convergences on both the African continent and the global South present broadened opportunities which our country must exploit at the government to government, business to business and people to people levels,” he said. The party, President Mnangagwa said, should guide discussions around these trends and provide the requisite thought leadership. “Our members, especially the youth, must be appropriately equipped to be active participants in the unfolding continental and global realities. Unity, peace and stability remain critical ingredients in our ongoing national development agenda. I call upon communities to remain focused on our ongoing quest to build a brighter and more prosperous future in all sectors, and the attainment of Vision 2030. “All forms of production and productivity, no matter the size, are important and contribute to our economic growth trajectory. Let us continue the culture of hard honest work in our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe,” he said. President Mnangagwa challenged the Zanu PF leadership to preach unity, hope and love among Zimbabweans. “Zanu PF keeps marching forward, modernising and industrialising our beloved motherland, Zimbabwe. We are scaling up the development of our local capacities and capabilities. Guided by our international relations philosophy, ‘friend to all and enemy of none’, all sectors of the economy are well on course in the exploitation of the immense opportunities in the international markets and global value chains. “Indeed, our citizens in both rural and urban areas, growth points and urbanised settlements must be organised, mobilised and facilitated to participate in our party’s programmes and projects. We must, as a party and country, never be distracted or pre-occupied by the sideshows of neo-imperialist political puppets,” he said. President Mnangagwa commended the Zanu PF Youth League and other youth organisations for successfully hosting the National Youth Day at Mushagashe Vocational Training Centre in Masvingo. “Well done to the Youth League and the young people of our country for such a superb demonstration of organisational ability and clarity of intentions with regards not only protecting our liberation war heritage but advancing the current national development epoch. Congratulations. I urge all our young people to continue on this very good trajectory and harness the demographic dividend, diverse skills and youthful zeal to propel nation-building programmes and projects. Always remain mindful that nyika inovakwa, inotongwa, inonamatigwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo’,” he said. President Mnangagwa challenged the youth to be alive to the founding provisions of the party constitution, values of hard honest work, discipline, patriotism and loyalty. He said youths must respect the party leadership and challenged the Women’s League, veterans of the liberation struggle and other Affiliates to mobilise people for the party.",

Everybody was healthy in my family. It was like, ‘What am I complaining about?’” he said. “I didn’t know.

This man is illuminating. And he’s got so many tassels and zippers.’”\nHe continued: “He was so nice and just soft-spoken and very kind and gentle in the way he would talk to people. So that was a really cool experience.”\nJust last week, fellow New Girl star Hannah Simone revealed that Prince only agreed to a cameo on the show because he had a “crush” on her .",

According to forecaster Ida Pramuwardani, rainfall levels are predicted to be low to moderate (0-150 mm/decade) from mid-July to early August.\nSeveral regions are expected to experience particularly low rainfall (\n“In early August, rainfall is anticipated to occur in many of these areas,” Ida said.\nImpact of La Nina conditions\nBMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati previously announced that La Nina conditions are expected to bring increased rainfall to several parts of Indonesia. This phenomenon can lead to the formation of rain clouds and a higher likelihood of precipitation.\nThe agency warns that the combination of various weather factors could result in moderate to heavy rain, accompanied by lightning, thunder, and strong winds. Consequently, this could result in extreme weather events or hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, flash floods, tornadoes, and landslides, particularly in central and eastern Indonesia.\nThe BMKG will continue to monitor weather conditions closely and provide updates to the public through its app Info BMKG, social media sites, and local offices.\nANGELINA TIARA PUSPITALOVA\nEditor’s Choice: La Nina Expected Around September, BRIN Forecasts Damp Dry Season in Indonesia\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",

The Ministry of Digital Transformation, together with the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) and the Brave1 cluster, conducted research on the drone production sector. «The production capacities of the Ukrainian drone industry increased more than 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023», the report said. According to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, production capacities increased from 300,000 drones in 2023 to 4 million in 2024. The ministry noted that after the introduction of mass production, the focus shifted to improving efficiency and using the latest technologies. Experts predict that manufacturers will start to merge in the coming years due to growing competition. «We are seeing significant progress in the creation of aerial, maritime, and land drones, as well as in the development of electronic warfare systems. Among the main trends are the use of computer vision technologies, 'swarming' systems, innovations in navigation and communication», added the Ministry of Digital Transformation. It should be noted that since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has significantly increased the production of drones of various types. They are manufactured by both state and private enterprises. Not only copters are produced in Ukraine, but also strike, reconnaissance drones, and maritime drones. The conditions of the full-scale war, in which Russia has a significant advantage in the air, forced Ukraine to actively seek new ways of confrontation. One of these methods is the development and use of unmanned aerial vehicles that can effectively neutralize Russian drones. The Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that they are constantly improving their drones to enhance their efficiency. 'Dragon drones' have become a vivid example of such adaptation. The industrial drone manufacturer Prodrone plans to supply Ukraine with drones for demining territories.
