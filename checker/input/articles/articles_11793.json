    "text": "The North Australia and Rangelands Fire Information service (NAFI) at Charles Darwin University (CDU) will continue to guide thousands of people through Northern Australia's intense fire seasons after being awarded a Federal Government grant for operations. NAFI received $588,000 through the Disaster Resilience Australia Package to continue operations in 2024/25. The funding will ensure the fire information web portal is available to land managers and owners, emergency services, governments, councils, and other agencies across Northern Australia for the peak fire weather season. Since its inception more than 20 years ago NAFI has played a critical role in bushfire prevention and management in Northern Australia, providing users with timely, accurate and easy to access data. NAFI's importance was highlighted in 2023 during the Barkly region bushfires, with the service receiving about 180,000 map requests a day for the infernos which ravaged more than 9,300 square kilometres of land and threatened Tennant Creek. NAFI Service Manager Dr Peter Jacklyn said NAFI had become a key part of land management, with many Traditional Owners, Indigenous rangers, pastoralists, park rangers and more currently using the platform to guide planned burns across their properties. \"This funding will allow this highly valued service to continue delivering fire information to people across large parts of Australia,\" Dr Jacklyn said. \"Importantly this funding will also provide resources allowing us to establish a sustainable funding platform for the NAFI service into the future. \"We saw what a vital service NAFI was during the large wildfires in the Northern Territory last year around Tennant Creek, and this funding will allow that service in emergencies to continue.\" CDU Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Innovation Professor Steve Rogers said the funding recognised NAFI's role in protecting the land, wildlife, and people of Northern Australia. \"For decades NAFI has played a crucial role in public safety, land management, and bushfire prevention, mapping, and detection,\" Professor Rogers said. \"It is run by a team with decades worth of fire knowledge and experience and has become an invaluable asset as the severity of bushfires increases. \"We appreciate the Federal Government's support and are proud to continue providing this service to the public, emergency services, government and non-government agencies and more.\" Federal Member for Solomon Luke Gosling OAM MP said the importance of NAFI could not be overstated. \"I'm pleased to see the Albanese Government invest in disaster preparedness in the North,\" Mr Gosling said. \"Programs like NAFI are so important for public information, including providing authorities and community members with data of where the fire is and where it's recently burned.\"",

    "text": "Tough sledding: Lake snows trouble motorists, region\nThursday’s weather in the north county was definitely frightful and led to government agencies banning and restricting travel on area streets and highways.\nIn the morning, the Chautauqua County government urged residents impacted by lake effect snow — including Ripley, Westfield, Portland, Dunkirk-Fredonia, Sheridan, and Silver Creek — to avoid unnecessary travel as hazardous winter weather pounded the region.\nThe National Weather Service issued a lake-effect snow warning for the region until 1 p.m. Friday, with total snow accumulations of 2 to 3 feet expected in the most persistent bands, along with wind gusts of up to 40 mph causing blowing and drifting snow.\nThese conditions led to poor visibility, whiteouts, and snow-covered roads, making travel extremely dangerous. Residents were advised to stay off the roads whenever possible and to monitor weather updates.\nAround 11 a.m., the city of Dunkirk Police Department, in cooperation with the Mayor’s Office, DPW, and DFD, issued a travel ban until further notice.\n“Only essential workers will still be allowed to travel to ensure that critical services continue uninterrupted,” Dunkirk police reported. “Essential workers are those who perform operations and services that are critical to maintaining infrastructure and public health and safety. We thank them for their dedication and commitment during this time.”\nCity officials also announced the cancellation of the Dunkirk Holiday Parade, which had been rescheduled for today.\nIn addition to the area schools, the Dunkirk Department of Motor Vehicle office, located at 3998 Vineyard Drive, is closed Thursday. The office plans to reopen during normal business hours Friday, weather permitting.\nAlso, the Fredonia Central Schools capital project vote on a $52 million plan that includes renovations to buildings, an addition to the music department and a new athletic facility was postponed on Thursday. The vote may take place today from 2 to 9 p.m. at the school cafeteria.\nHazardous conditions in the city and north county included:\n— Strong winds and heavy, blowing snow may cause drifting, downed trees, and power lines.\n— Downed power lines. Always assume any downed line is live and energized. Maintain a safe distance of at least 35 feet.\n—- Traffic signals. Treat intersections as a four-way stop if traffic lights lose power.\nNational Weather Service spotters reported snowfall amounts from Wednesday to early Thursday as: Silver Creek, 12 inches; Dunkirk, 6; Fredonia, 4.9; Cassadaga, 3.7; Mayville, 1.4; Bemus Point, 0.5. Areas to the north in southern Erie County received more than 2 feet around Orchard Park and Hamburg.\nTotals were higher in numerous locations due to blowing and drifting snow.\nOn Wednesday evening, state Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a State of Emergency in portions of the Western New York, Finger Lakes.\n“As winter weather bears down on our state, I am declaring a State of Emergency so our communities have the resources they need to stay safe,” Hochul said. “We are deploying resources and working alongside our partners in government as we prepare for every possibility — I encourage all New Yorkers to stay alert, stay off the roads if possible, and keep in contact with family and friends as we move through the next 48 hours.”\nThe State of Emergency was in effect for Cattaraugus, Chautauqua and Erie counties through Friday.",

    "title": "Texas Bird Hunters Helped Fund a New Drug That’s Saving Wild Quail",
    "text": "A new medicated feed that combats deadly parasites in wild quail will be available to the public starting this fall. The new drug was developed by researchers at Texas Tech University with the financial support of Texas bird hunters, and it has proven effective in experimental settings on multiple ranches in the Lone Star State.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the aptly-named\nQuailGuard for public use on May 23, Texas Monthly reports. This came after more than a decade of research, testing, and careful field applications, which were funded in large part by the Texas quail hunting community. Although there are other medicated feeds approved for use in farmed quail, this is the first one to be approved for wild populations, the FDA points out in a press release. It’s also reportedly the first publicly-available FDA-approved medication for wild animals.\nThe search for a medication that could help wild quail began in 2010, which was a horrible year for wild birds in Texas. After seeing mysterious population crashes in the Rolling Plains region, a historic hotspot for Northern bobwhites, hunters started thinking about solutions. A group of those hunters, many of them members of the\nPark Cities Quail Coalition in the Dallas area, raised $7 million to fund a long-term research project led by Ron Kendall, a scientist and wildlife professor who runs the Wildlife Toxicology Lab at Texas Tech University.\nA quail hunter himself, Kendall started by ruling out the most common causes behind the boom-and-bust cycles that have long defined Texas quail populations: drought and poor habitat.\nRead Next:\nThe Biggest Fire in Texas History Will Help Quail Someday. Right Now It’s Killing Them\n“Everything was set up for a great hunting season in 2010,” Kendall told the\nDallas News in 2019. “The habitat was in perfect shape throughout the summer across the rolling plains. You had to be really careful driving around ranch roads because there were so many broods. Then, come fall, you couldn’t hardly find a quail. I’m not talking about losing a few. Many ranches lost 70 to 90 percent of their birds.”\nWorking with other biologists from Texas Tech and Texas A&M Universities, Kendall’s team trapped and studied thousands of birds over the following years. The resulting data pointed to two parasites as the leading culprits behind the 2010 crash. Researchers found that two parasites that had already been recognized in wild quail — eyeworms and caecal worms — were even worse than originally believed. Both worms reproduce rapidly in the birds’ eyeballs and intestines and ultimately compromise their vision, rob them of nutrients and make them more susceptible to predators. And because quail live in coveys, the parasites can spread quickly through wild populations.\nKendall’s research found that up to 98 percent of quail populations in the Rolling Plains were carrying these parasites, which can also affect domestic poultry. This meant there was already an available cure in the form of\nfenbendazole, a de-worming drug that livestock growers have long incorporated into their feed. Kendall suspected it would have the same positive effects on wild birds, and his son helped devise a specialized feeder that gave quail cover from predators.\nThe results of their initial tests on a ranch in Mitchell County were overwhelmingly positive. The FDA observed follow-up studies, which showed that the drug was both safe and effective for wild birds.\nRead Next:\nO’Connor at the Border: A Short-Lived Hot Spot for Hunting Gambel’s Quail\n“Where we were using the medicated feed, we weren’t seeing quail crashes and were seeing sustainable quail populations,” Kendall told Texas Monthly.\nThe medicated feed is now being manufactured at a facility near Fort Worth under the name QuailGuard. The company producing the feed is co-owned by Kendall and the Park Cities Quail Coalition, which plans to use part of the profits to fund conservation and education efforts, according to Texas Monthly.",

    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast\n(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is\ndriving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and urgent warnings from officials of swells that could damage piers and boats and threaten onlookers, after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday.\nNearly 20 people were swept away by a wave that crashed into onlookers standing behind a barrier along the southern California beach, and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nSome parts of the California coast will see high water and dangerous rip currents through the weekend as the large waves keep rolling in. Coastal flood and high-surf alerts cover much of the West coast from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon on Friday, the National Weather Service said.\nSan Francisco could see waves as high as telephone poles — up to 40 feet — through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected in the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nSome coastal streets in Ventura have been closed as a precaution. In order to discourage spectators, officials also closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office\nissued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nBut Northern California will not be spared.\nThe Bay Area is under a high wind alert Friday and could see gusts of up to 50 mph. The weather service warned Thursday that the area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet.\nRain is also expected to fall on the Bay Area and areas north of it throughout the day Friday before spreading south on Saturday.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition known for having\nsome of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner\ntold the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
