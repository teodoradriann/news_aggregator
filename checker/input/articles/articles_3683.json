    "text": "Iraq, Iran demand immediate ceasefire in Lebanon amid regional tensions Iraq iran Israel Hezbollah Lebanon 2024-09-26T19:14:08+00:00 Share font Enable Reading Mode A- A A+\nShafaq News/ Iraq and Iran have called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon, amid escalating tensions in the region that threaten to spark a wider conflict, according to a joint statement released on Thursday.\nIraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein and his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, met on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York to discuss the deteriorating situation in Lebanon.\n\"The catastrophic humanitarian and economic consequences, along with the direct security implications, threaten international peace and security,\" the ministers said in a joint statement.\nBoth ministers underscored the need for a unified stance, especially among Islamic countries, to pressure for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon. They also criticized the international community's inadequate response to the ongoing conflict.\n\"The ministers discussed the Iraqi proposal presented to the Arab group, calling for an Arab and Islamic summit aimed at mobilizing international support to halt the firing in Lebanon,\" the statement read. Hussein affirmed that Iraq will continue to pursue this proposal in the coming days.\nThe statement said Hussein and Araghchi reviewed bilateral relations between Iraq and Iran, emphasizing the importance of the recent visit of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to Baghdad.\nEarlier today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel will continue striking Hezbollah “with full force” and will not stop until all of its goals are achieved. Israel carried out a new strike in the Lebanese capital, which it said killed a senior Hezbollah commander.\nHundreds have been killed in Lebanon this week as Israel dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities. Israeli leaders say they are determined to stop more than 11 months of cross-border fire by the powerful Lebanese group, which has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis from communities in the north.",

    "text": "Heavy rains lashed Bengaluru on Thursday night, causing widespread disruption in the city and its suburbs. The downpour led to water entering Kempegowda International Airport in Devanahalli town, Bengaluru Rural district. According to TV9 reports, rainwater seeped through the roof of Terminal 2, reaching the luggage bay and creating difficulties for airport staff.\nThe airport area experienced thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, resulting in the diversion of more than 18 flights, according to airport sources.\nThis incident comes less than two years after the inauguration of Terminal 2, which commenced operations on August 31, 2023. The terminal, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2022, began domestic flight operations on January 15, 2023.\nApart from airport disruptions, the heavy rains also caused other disturbances across Bengaluru. In Rajarajeshwari City, Nripatunga Road was blocked as four or five trees were uprooted, hindering pedestrian movement.\nBengaluru Weather: Heavy Rains Wreak Havoc At Kempegowda Airport, Flight Operations Disrupted\nAdditionally, in NGF Layout, Nagarbavi, a tree and an electric pole fell on a shed, narrowly missing a family from Raichur who had come to work as laborers. The family, including Shiva, his children, and wife, had a lucky escape.\nOverall, around 70 trees were uprooted in Bengaluru on Thursday night, with 10 in Bangalore South Zone, 32 in RR Nagar Zone, 6 in Bommanahalli, 10 in West Zone, 1 in Mahadevpur, 3 in Yelahanka, 6 in East Zone, and 2 in Dasarahalli Zone.\nMadhuri Adnal Oneindia",

La France sera représentée par le ministre des Armées. Sébastien Lecornu se rendra le mardi 7 mai à une grande parade militaire, puis à l'hommage aux morts vietnamiens dans un cimetière militaire. Puis il rendra un hommage distinct aux soldats français au mémorial français de Diên Biên Phu. Avec notre correspondant à Ho-Chi-Minh-Ville, Frédéric Noir Diên Biên Phu : trois syllabes hautement symboliques, dans les montagnes du nord du Vietnam , ou l’armée française a subi l'une de ses défaites les plus retentissantes. Le combat opposait 15 000 soldats du corps expéditionnaire français à 50 000 soldats vietminh. Le 7 mai 54, après 57 jours de combats d’une rare férocité, le camp retranché français tomba finalement aux mains des forces vietnamiennes. À l’issue de la bataille, environ 12 000 soldats français furent capturés par le Vietminh, dont les deux tiers mourront dans les camps de « rééducation ». Le bilan des combats est, lui, de plus de 3 000 morts côté français, plus de 8 000 côté vietnamien.

    "text": "In his magisterial history The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon identified the loss of civic virtue as the “secret poison” that undermined this sprawling global empire and inevitably led to its demise. The Catholic Church is not about to disintegrate in the same fashion as the Roman Empire, but its unity, grounded in the infallible papal magisterium, seems to be unraveling, and its eternal doctrines are no longer safe from radical revision.\nWe can probably isolate several such poisons in the Church that undermine the deposit of faith, but there is one that is particularly insidious. It involves a departure from what liberal theologians regard as a “sexophobic morality,” and it accounts for profane documents such as Fiducia Supplicans. As everyone knows by now, this declaration from the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith sanctions the blessing of same-sex couples and those in other irregular relationships, so long as those blessings are not liturgical and do not convey the impression of marriage.\nFiducia Supplicans directly flows from principles and premises articulated in the apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia. Following the decadent path of moral theology of the 1970s, Amoris Laetitia misconstrues God’s authoritative commands as “rules” that express “ideals” to which we should all aspire. It ignores the fact that some of these commands, such as the divine prohibition against adultery, allow for no exceptions. On the contrary, these rules are subject to exceptions, excuses, and mitigating circumstances.\nOrthodox. Faithful. Free.\nSign up to get Crisis articles delivered to your inbox daily\nGiven our weakness and disposition to noetic and moral frailty, it’s not possible for everyone to follow these rules, especially those that pertain to sexual morality. According to Amoris Laetitia, some Catholics are “not in a position…to fully carry out the objective demands of the law” (295). The pope proceeds to explain that those in irregular situations, such as Catholics divorced and remarried without an annulment, are not necessarily living in a state of mortal sin even if they are not ignorant of the relevant rule. “A subject may know the rule, yet…be in a concrete situation which does not allow him or her to act differently and decide otherwise” (301).\nAmoris Laetitia clearly suggests that the Church’s traditional understanding of indissoluble, monogamous marriage, anchored in the words of Jesus Himself, is one of those lofty ideals. It refers to “the ideal of marriage, marked by a commitment to exclusivity and stability” (34). While this “ideal” cannot be negated, more flexibility is necessary in order to achieve psychological balance for those who cannot live up to its demands. The Church must begin to modify and limit its antiquated ideas about sexuality, even if it does so in ways that are essentially contradictory.\nThus, Amoris Laetitia presents the faithful with a revised attitude about sin (and particularly sexual sin) that softens the urgent need for conversion and repentance. Sin is conceived not so much as an offense against God but as a falling short of aspirations. Some Catholics cannot keep God’s commandments and are faced with the prospect of living at a distance from ideals like indissoluble marriage or chastity. It follows from this new theology that same-sex couples merit the Church’s blessing, since their only fault is failing to live up to moral ideals that are often too burdensome.\nIn\nanswering the dubia of five Cardinals submitted just before the Synod on Synodality, the pope wrote that while the sexual relationship of these same-sex couples may not be morally acceptable from an objective viewpoint, “pastoral charity requires that we do not simply treat as ‘sinners’ other people whose guilt or responsibility may be mitigated by various factors…” (emphasis added).\nMoreover, according to Amoris Laetitia, “a pastor cannot feel that it is enough to apply moral laws to those living in ‘irregular’ situations as if they were stones to throw at people” (305). Instead of throwing those stones like the Pharisees in John’s Gospel, a blessing is imparted, recognizing the positive elements in the relationship—“all that is true, good, and humanly valid in their lives” (Fiducia Supplicans, 31). Those positive elements suggest at least an imperfect living out of the ideal, and a blessing expresses the hope that this couple will strive to grow in full fidelity to the Gospel. However, the only way to truly achieve that fidelity is continence or a dissolution of this gravely sinful relationship. The painful reality that these couples are engaged in immoral activity, in sodomy or adultery, is ignored and obscured by a tangled web of euphemisms.\nWe find this same highly questionable reasoning in answers to the recent dubia submitted by\nCardinal Duka concerning reception of Confession and the Eucharist for those divorced Catholics who have entered into a second, civil union. Those dubia sought to clarify the ambiguity of Amoris Laetitia on this issue. This statement claims that after a period of discernment, divorced Catholics can receive sacramental absolution and the Holy Eucharist even if they do not live chastely in the second relationship.\nFor Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, these sacraments were only possible for those couples living out a chaste life. But according to the dubia, composed by Cardinal Fernández, “Francis maintains the proposal of full continence for the divorced and remarried in a new union, but admits that there may be difficulties in practicing it and therefore allows in certain cases, after proper discernment, the administration of the sacrament of Reconciliation [and the Holy Eucharist] even when one fails in being faithful to the continence proposed by the Church.” Thus, Catholic couples in a second marriage do not have to cease sexual relations if they conclude that such an action is not possible.\nOf course, there are many serious deficiencies in the theological reasoning of Amoris Laetitia. The supposition that keeping God’s commandments is impossible for some is completely incongruous with Scripture and Tradition. Jesus tells us that “whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received, and it will be yours” (Mark 11:24). We can also take comfort in Jesus’ instruction to St. Paul: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).\nThe heterodox doctrine of Amoris Laetitia also contradicts the clear teaching of Trent: “God does not command the impossible; but in commanding he cautions you both to do what you can and to pray for what you cannot, and He helps you so that you can do it.” God’s grace, therefore, allows every Christian to avoid grave sin. Also overlooked in Amoris Laetitia is the Church’s long and unyielding tradition absolutely forbidding sins of the flesh, including adultery, fornication, and homosexual activity, that has been witnessed to by many martyrs from saints like Agatha and Agnes to St. Maria Goretti.\nPope St. John Paul II was no stranger to the arguments resurrected by Pope Francis and addressed them quite explicitly in Veritatis Splendor:\nIt would be a very serious error to conclude that the Church’s teaching is essentially only an “ideal” which must then be adapted, proportioned, graduated to the so-called concrete possibilities of man…. But of which man are we speaking? Of man dominated by lust or of man redeemed by Christ? This is what is at stake: the reality of Christ’s redemption. Christ has redeemed us. This means that he has given us the possibility of realizing the entire truth of our being; he has set our freedom free from the domination of concupiscence. (103)\nUnlike Pope Francis, Pope John Paul II believed, as the Church has always believed, that the redeemed person, despite his weakness, is quite capable of living out the demands of the Gospel and achieving the “entire truth of his being.” That truth means that sexual relations ordered to procreation are the exclusive privilege of a married man and woman who are “no longer two but one” (Matthew 19:5).\nThe pope’s allies like Archbishop Paglia have referred to Amoris Laetitia as a paradigm shift, and this exuberant claim is not just hyperbole. As such, it not only opens the door for sacrileges like the blessing of same-sex relationships. In the words of Italian philosopher Augusto Del Noce, it also ushers in a transition from “ascetic Christianity” to a more “secularized” Christianity. The latter will slowly lead to a complete reversal of Catholic teaching on sexuality that is affirmed so clearly in the Gospel. As Del Noce points out, this new permissive attitude wipes away from the horizon the “passive and mortifying virtues” such as chastity and purity. These private virtues are now considered “repressive” even if Church authorities dare not explicitly admit this.\nGiven the impaired theology proposed by Pope Francis in Amoris Laetitia, it is no surprise that he does not meet with groups like Courage, which call active homosexuals to live a life of chastity. He prefers, instead, to support the work of Dignity and New Ways Ministry, which make no such demands on their followers. The pope has also spoken several times about our excessive preoccupation with “sins below the waist.” In an\ninterview with the Portuguese Jesuits during World Youth Day, the pope lamented that the Church still looks at the so-called “sins of the flesh” with a “magnifying glass,” while other evils—such as exploitation of workers, lying, and cheating—are minimized. The implication is that political virtues should take priority over the private ones.\nBut is the pope right about his apparent rejection of ascetic Christianity and the ostracizing of virtues like chastity and purity? And was the Church’s magisterium so wrong until Pope Francis in preserving and promoting those virtues as integral to the Faith and to our salvation?",

    "text": "Holy Saturday 2024: Among the seven holy days of Good Friday, Holy Saturday is observed with great devotion. Also known as Holy, Great or Joyous Saturday, it is considered an important day when Jesus Christ's body was placed in the tomb after the crucifixion on Good Friday. This year, Holy Saturday will be observed on March 30 and Easter will be celebrated on March 31.\nHoly Saturday 2024: History And Significance\nChristians observe a sombre and contemplative period known as Holy Saturday, Great Saturday, Black Saturday, or Easter Vigil when the sun sets on Good Friday. For Christians worldwide, Holy Saturday represents a day of reflection and repose. On this day, Christians observe a day of grief as they remember Jesus Christ&apos;s death and burial. As Christians anticipate the celebration of Christ&apos;s resurrection on Easter Sunday, there is a sense of hope and expectation among the gloom and grief.\nHoly Saturday, according to Christian beliefs, is significant to humanity&apos;s redemption because it commemorates the moment when Christ descended into hell to release the souls of the righteous who had passed away before his crucifixion. This idea, which is sometimes referred to as the &apos;Harrowing of Hell&apos; or the &apos;Descent into Hell,&apos; is significant to the Easter narrative.\nHoly Saturday 2024: Rituals And Facts\nIt became common in many churches to build a tomb or bier and set a statue of Jesus&apos; body on it. The lay faithful were then urged to spend time in prayer in front of the melancholy tomb. For most of recorded history, there were very few, if any, public liturgies held prior to the Easter Vigil. As a result, the church was silent from Good Friday afternoon until late on Holy Saturday night.\nHoly Saturday is a special day when the Church welcomes us into this intense period of &apos;waiting,&apos; a time that is bordered on joy but nonetheless characterised by grief.\nHistorians believe that Holy Saturday was also a day that did not have a Mass. Instead, Christians held an all-night vigil that started in the middle of the night on Saturday and didn&apos;t end until the first rays of dawn when the celebration of Mass began on Easter morning.\nFor many centuries there was even a strict fast on Holy Saturday, permitting no food to be eaten in observance of this painful day. Many would stay in the church throughout the night of Good Friday, keeping Jesus company in the tomb.\n&apos;Holy Saturday&apos; is also referred to as &apos;Low Saturday&apos; (referring to the ceasing of celebration) and sometimes &apos;Easter Eve&apos;.",

    "text": "Miami Heat Veteran Celebrates Jimmy Butler’s Impending Return\nCount Miami Heat forward Kevin Love among those excited to see Jimmy Butler hit the court Friday night.\nLove celebrated Butler’s impending return with an Instagram post Thursday. The veteran big man shared an infamous scene from The Wolf of Wall Street where Leonardo DiCaprio’s character expresses he’s “not f----g leaving.”\n“LIVE LOOK - Jimmy after his meeting with Micky,” Love wrote, adding a #getmyjoyback caption.\n“Micky” refers to Heat owner Micky Arison, who reportedly planned to meet with Butler before Friday’s game against the Nuggets.\nThe Heat suspended Butler two weeks ago for conduct detrimental to the team; he requested a trade Jan. 2. He remained in Miami during the Heat’s West Coast road trip and worked out at team facilities.\nIt is unclear how much Butler will play Friday night. He’s played only 59 total minutes across three games since Dec. 20.\nIt’s also unclear how the Kayesa Center crowd will react to Butler’s presence. At least he knows Love still has his back.\nHEAT BRINGING BACK VICE UNIFORMS\nButler isn’t the only impending returner for the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat announced Thursday they’ll begin wearing their popular Vice uniforms again, beginning Friday night.\nThese are the Original Vice jerseys the team first wore in 2018, a year before Butler arrived via trade.\nThe white Vice uniform replaces the Heat’s traditional white Association look.\n“This ain’t a dream - we’re ready to rock the #TheOriginalVice,” the Heat’s official X (formerly Twitter) account posted.\nButler is expected to return Friday night following his seven-game suspension. The Heat featured a Vice version of Butler’s jersey on their website Thursday morning.\nREDICK OFFERS LOFTY PRAISE FOR HERRO\nLos Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick likes what he sees from Heat point guard Tyler Herro.\nIn fact, Redick acknowledged teams need to gameplan around Herro the way they do for an NBA great.\n“You gotta treat this guy like Steph Curry,” Redick said after the Lakers’ 117-108 victory over the Heat. “That’s the way he’s playing right now.”\nComparing any player to Curry, one of the greatest sharpshooters in league history, warrants serious examination. However, Herro has certainly earned that degree of praise in his best season yet.\nHerro scored a game-high 34 points on 12 of 18 shooting Wednesday night. He added four rebounds, three assists, and a steal.\nWhen it comes to modeling Curry, Herro drilled seven of his 12 three-pointers. Only Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Anthony Edwards, who has made 167 threes this season, has more than Herro’s 156.\n“Just trying to take what the defense gives me,” Herro told reporters Wednesday. “Open shots; they overreact to different things, and I just take advantage of what they give me.”\nGood news for Redick: he won’t need to see Herro again this season unless the Lakers and Heat miraculously face off in the NBA Finals.\nMIAMI HEAT ON SI’S JIMMY BUTLER COVERAGE\nNBA Legend Rips Pat Riley for Disrespecting Jimmy Butler\nNBA Insiders Believe Miami Heat Should Have Moved Jimmy Butler Last Season\n14-Year NBA Vet Blasts Heat President Pat Riley, Supporters\nMiami Heat Fans Still Debating Jimmy Butler’s Legacy\nMORE HEAT NEWS\nNBA Insider Reveals Jimmy Butler Hasn’t Opposed Trade To Eastern Conference Title Contender\nTrade Proposal: Miami Heat Add Electrifying Scorer From Utah Jazz\nJake Elman works as a contributing writer to Miami Heat on SI.
