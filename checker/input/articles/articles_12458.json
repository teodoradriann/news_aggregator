    "title": "Potential Target for Medicaid Cuts Would End Coverage for 20 Million People",
    "text": "📢 Action Needed: Tell Congress to Protect Federal Funding\nAs we discussed last week, the Republican-controlled Congress is considering massive cuts to Medicaid. All cuts to Medicaid are harmful and would have ripple effects that hurt the Medicare program and its beneficiaries.\nOne type of cut being discussed would target the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion population. This may sound familiar. In 2018, the last time the ACA was at risk, its Medicaid expansion was a particular target for repeal. The new efforts may come with a twist, however. Instead of directly eliminating the expansion, Congress could keep it in place but reduce its federal funding, shifting those costs to states.\nKFF has new numbers estimating the state-by-state impact of this policy under two different scenarios. In Scenario 1, states would continue to fund their Medicaid expansions despite the greater cost. According to KFF, this would result in a 17% increase in state Medicaid spending over 10 years. This number would go higher if anything like a pandemic or recession caused a surge in Medicaid enrollment.\nIn Scenario 2, states would drop their expansions entirely, unable to afford the $626 billion in additional costs. This would kick 20 million low-income people out of their insurance coverage. While dropping this coverage would prevent the catastrophic budget effects of trying to pay for the expansion using only state dollars, increasing the uninsured rate has ripple effects for the economy and the health care system, in addition to the suffering and increased health and financial harms for the people losing access to coverage and care.\nImportantly, nine states have “trigger laws” on the books that require them to terminate the expansion if the federal government’s financial support dwindles. Three other states have laws that would require them to find other sources of funding under such circumstances. So, even if some states wanted to continue covering their expansion population, they may be unable to do so.\nWhile Medicare would not be directly affected by changes in federal or state funding for the Medicaid expansion, cuts to Medicaid harm Medicare beneficiaries in many ways. Anything that stresses state budgets puts programs on which older adults and people with disabilities rely at risk. That pool of dollars is finite, and either bearing the sole cost of the Medicaid expansion or the sole cost of increasing numbers of uninsured people is a stressor on state financial health that could limit capacity for and access to other programs.\nMany people with Medicare have caregivers who are insured through expansion Medicaid. This includes family caregivers and also formal, paid direct care workers whose wages lag behind those in other industries and who often qualify for Medicaid despite working full time. If they lose coverage and experience health and financial instability as a result, they may be unable to provide care, putting the Medicare beneficiary’s health and future at risk as well.\nAt Medicare Rights, we see Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA as a set of interconnected programs. A cut to one is a cut to all, with damaging effects on beneficiaries, families, providers, and taxpayers. We will continue to urge policymakers to work toward more access to affordable, high-quality care, not kicking people out of their coverage.\nThe Senate may vote on its harmful budget proposal in the coming days, and the House is expected to follow suit as soon as next week. Now is the time to send Congress a clear message: Don’t cut Medicaid!\nRead more about attempts to cut Medicaid.\nRead more about past attempts to eliminate the Medicaid expansion.\nSign up to receive Medicare news, policy developments, and other useful updates from the Medicare Rights.\nView this profile on Instagram\nMedicare Rights Center • Instagram photos and videos",

    "title": "How to Use Template Literals in JavaScript",
    "text": "Template literals are a feature in JavaScript that were introduced with ES6. They gives you a more flexible and maintainable way of working with strings in JavaScript. By the end of this article, you will know how to use template literals. You will learn the syntax, the benefits, and some use cases. And you will also learn about an even more powerful feature called tagged template literals. Table of Contents [What are Template Literals?](#what-are-template-literals) [Template Literals vs Regular Strings](#template-literals-vs-regular-strings) [Some Use Cases of Template Literals](#some-practical-use-cases-of-template-literals) [Tagged Template Literals](#tagged-template-literals) [Examples of Tagged Template Literals](#practical-example-of-tagged-template-literal) [Conclusion](#conclusion) What are Template Literals? Template literasl are a feature in JavaScript that let developers work with strings in a convenient way. You denote regular strings in JavaScript using double quotes \"\" or single quotes ''. But with template literals, you denote strings using backticks ``. This lets you embed variables and expressions within your strings. Here's an example: const website = 'freeCodeCamp' const message = `Welcome to ${website}` console.log(message) The value of the message variable is an example of a template literal. It includes backticks which are used to define the template literal. And it also includes the syntax ${} which is used to embed variables within the string. Template Literals vs Regular Strings Let's now take a look at how template literals differ from regular strings and also some of the benefits of using template literals. String Concatenation Before the introduction of template literals, you had to use the plus + symbol when you wanted to concatenate strings. const userName = 'Marie' const balance = 10 // Using regular string const str1 = 'Hi ' + userName + ',' + ' your balance is ' + balance + '.' console.log(\"Regular string: \", str1) // Using template literal const str2 = `Hi ${userName}, your balance is ${balance}.` console.log(\"Template literal: \", str2) Note how using regular strings involves adding many plus signs. And also accounting for whitespace at the right places. This can get difficult to deal with when working with lengthy strings. With the template literal example, there was no need to add any plus signs. You write everything together as a single string. The variables are directly embedded using the ${} syntax. Multi-line Strings Another way template literals make it easier to work with strings is when dealing with multi line strings. For regular strings, you have to use a combination of the plus + sign and \\n to denote a new line. But template literals don't require any of that. const regularString = 'Hello there! \\n' + 'Welcome to our website. \\n' + 'How can we help you today?' const templateLiteral = `Hello there! Welcome to our website. How can we help you today?` console.log(regularString) console.log(templateLiteral) Both the regularString and templateLiteral variables give the same output. The template string recognises whitespaces and linebreaks automatically. Readability and Maintainability Template literals also make your code more readable and easier to maintain. As you've seen already, they doesn't require any concatenation with the plus + sign. And you also don't need to worry about escaping quotations marks. Here's an example: const city = \"Paris\" const str1 = 'She said, \"I love ' + city + ', it\\'s a beautiful place.\"' const str2 = `She said, \"I love ${city}, it's a beautiful place` console.log(regularString) console.log(templateLiteral) Unlike the template literal, the regular string requires the following; - The use of the plus +for concatenation. - Careful use of single and double quotes. - The need to escape the single quote in string with \\. Some Practical Use Cases of Template Literals So far, you've learned what template literals are and how they compare with regular strings. Now, let's look at some practical examples. Generating HTML Markup You will often see template literals used for generating HTML markup. They allow you to embed JavaScript expressions directly into HTML strings. This makes it easy to create content that's dynamic and data driven. Example: const user = { name: \"Marie\", age: 25, }; const userProfile = ` Name: ${user.name} Age: ${user.age}\n` Note how the ${} syntax allows you to run JavaScript expressions directly within the string. In this case, it's used to read the values of the user object's properties. Creating Dynamic SQL Queries You can also use template literals to create dynamic SQL queries by embedding variables or expressions directly into the query strings. This means you can easily create queries based on runtime values. Example: const tableName = \"users\"; const columnName = \"name\"; const searchValue = \"John\"; const sqlQuery = `SELECT * FROM ${tableName} WHERE ${columnName} = '${searchValue}'` Localization and Internalization Another practical use of template literals is for handling localization and internationalization in your apps. It's easier to manage translations because with template literals, you can embed variables for localized content or language keys directly into strings. Example: const user = { name: \"Marie\", }; const locale = \"fr\"; const greetings = { en: \"Hello\", es: \"Hola\", fr: \"Bonjour\" }; const localizedGreeting = `${greetings[locale]} ${user.name}!`; console.log(localizedGreeting) This example creates a localizedGreeting string without relying on any cumbersome concatenation. Tagged Template Literals This is a feature of the JavaScript template literal that you can use to perform advanced string manipulation. To use this feature, you need a tag function and then a tagged template. The tagFunction takes in a mix of strings and variables as arguments. It then formats them based on some condition or rules you set. Then, you call (or run) the tag function by placing it before the opening backtick of the template literal. Syntax for Tagged Template Literal function taggedFunc(strings, ...values) { console.log(strings) console.log(values) } const name = 'Sarah' const city = 'Rome' taggedFunc`Hello ${name}. Welcome to ${city}.` There are three things to take note of here. First, the first parameter ( strings in this example) is always an array of all the blocks of strings in the template literal. In this case, it is the array below. ['Hello ', '. Welcome to ', '.'] Next, the rest of the parameters will be all the variables and evaluated expressions within the template literals. The [JavaScript rest parameter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-rest-vs-spread-operators/) syntax ...values makes it simple to get all of them. ['Sarah', 'Rome'] Finally, take note of how the taggedFunc is used. Unlike a regular function, you won't call it with a parenthesis. But by attaching it before the first backtick of the template literal. taggedFunc`Hello ${name}. Welcome to ${city}.` ✅ taggedFunc(Hello ${name}. Welcome to ${city}.) ❌ Practical Example of Tagged Template Literal Now let's see some practical examples of using a tagged template literal to handle string manipulation. Example 1 function receiptTag(strings, ...values) { let finalString = '' for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) { finalString += strings[i] + values[i] } // Add the last string literal finalString += strings[strings.length - 1] return finalString } const item = 'apple' const price = 2.5 const quantity = 3 const message = receiptTag` You have ${quantity} ${item}s. Unit cost: $${price}. Total cost: $${quantity * price}. ` console.log(message) In this example, the recieptTag function receives a template literal with four expressions: ${quantity} ${item} ${price} ${quantity * price} The values array will contain the evaluated values of these expressions. [3, 'apple', 2.5, 7.5] And you can process them accordingly in the tagged function. The result, logged to the console is a message that includes information about the quantity, item, unit cost and total cost. Example 2 function greetUser(strings, name) { const now = new Date() const currentHour = now.getHours() const timeOfDay = currentHour < 12 ? 'morning' : currentHour < 17 ? 'afternoon' : 'evening' return `Good ${timeOfDay} ${name}${strings[1]}` } const userName = 'Ama' console.log(greetUser`Hello ${userName}, nice to meet you!`) This example uses tagged template literal to determine how to greet the user based on what time of day it is. The function first gets the current hour using the date object. Then uses a tenary operator to determin time of day. And returns a string with a timeOfDay variable indicating what time of day it is. Also, pay attention to the first word of the log statement and compare it to the first word of the string passed to the tag to see how the function has changed the string. Conclusion Template literals provide a convenient way to work with strings in JavaScript. In this article, you've learned about the syntax, and how to use them in your projects. You also learned about an advanced feature of template literals: tagged template literals. These are functions that take in an array of string blocks and expressions. They return a string based on the logic you write for the function. Thanks for reading. And happy coding!

    "text": "freeze-ready\nTexas expert tips to protect people, pets, plants, pools, and cars from the freeze\nAs an Arctic front chills much of the country and sweeps through Texas, Austin is preparing for its first freeze of 2024. Fortunately, current forecasts suggest that Texas won’t be ravaged by a long, devastating storm like Uri in 2021, which saw thousands without power and water for days.\nCultureMap news partner KVUE’s team of meteorologists has\ndetermined that the Arctic cold front will arrive late Saturday night, with a hard freeze beginning Sunday, January 14. The team suggests having a care plan ready by Saturday afternoon.\n\"The most recent forecast model runs show temperatures struggling to make it above freezing on Monday afternoon,\" says KVUE's report. \"There is a slight possibility our area will remain at or below freezing on Monday and Tuesday, with temperatures not returning above freezing until Wednesday afternoon. ... The National Weather Service has mentioned the potential for some parts of Central Texas remaining below freezing for over 60 hours.\"\nFreeze-ready\nExperience tells us to safeguard the four Ps: people, pets, pipes, plants. As Austin is a car town, getting the ride ready for the plunging temps is also crucial.\nWith that in mind, CultureMap enlisted some local experts to assist harried Texans prep for our sudden freeze. Some tips are elementary, some are refreshers, and all are helpful to prevent headaches later.\nPeople\nClearly, residents are advised to stay indoors as much as possible.\nEnvironmental conservation organization Sierra Club shared via its Lone Star Chapter on\nAlso: Don't panic!\nPanic buying at grocery stores has been well-recorded over the years, but losing sight of what you really need makes things harder for others to get what they need. (How much milk and toilet paper can you really go through?)\nPets\nTragically, animals — especially dogs and cats — suffer brutally during extreme temps. “When the temperature drops, the absolute best thing you can do for your pet is to bring them inside — remember, dogs and cats can get frostbite and hypothermia just like humans,” Tena Lundquist Faust, co-president of\nHouston PetSet, tells CultureMap.\nTama Lundquist, co-president of Houston PetSet, reminds Houstonians who witness animal abuse or a dog cruelly chained or tethered outside in the elements to contact their law enforcement agency or file a report with a task force. In Austin, that would be the Austin Police Department’s Animal Cruelty Unit, reachable via 3-1-1.\n“It is now required by law to provide adequate shelter that will protect dogs from the elements. If you see dogs left outside without shelter, please report it,” she says. “With the temperatures dropping, that call could save that dog’s life.”\nAnimal-loving Austinites can also leave cat or dog food — and water, after the freeze — outside for wandering strays who may need some nourishment. Consider donating to local shelters, rescues, and on-the-ground animal assistance groups as well.\nCultureMap Dallas senior editor\nTeresa Gubbins adds these tips from the SPCA of Texas:\n- Tap your hood. Warm engines attract cats and small animals, who nestle under the hood but can get seriously hurt if a car is running. Tap your hood before starting your car to scare them out.\n- Check their paws. Check and wipe paws after walks to protect against harsh weather and salt after outdoor walks.\n- Sweater weather. Consider a warm dry coat for your pet when outdoors.\n- Watch for chemicals. Antifreeze is poisonous - keep it out of reach.\n- Stay indoors. Keep potty breaks quick, and monitor your pet while outside.\n- Be alert. Keep an eye out for signs of hypothermia such as shivering, whining, lethargy, decreased heart rate, and trouble walking or breathing.\nGubbins also has tips for helping wildlife, courtesy of The North Texas Wildlife Center:\n- Put out fresh water in various size bowls, checking frequently to break it up if it freezes, or keep it from freezing with a heated bowl or heating device.\n- Leaves, sticks, and straw provide nesting materials and shelter for wildlife to stay warm.\n- Put out whole or shelled nuts for squirrels.\n- Place birdseed in sheltered areas such as under bushes, carports, or umbrellas, to protect from harsh winds.\n- Keep your cats and dogs indoors.\nWildlife may seek food at the warmest time of the day; Don't be surprised to see wild animals at odd times.\nPlants\nThose with a green thumb have no doubt tended to their floral family. For those who need a little help, Zach Buchanan, owner of\nBuchanan’s Native Plants in Houston, offers some tips — and encouragement — after the freeze ravages our planted flora.\n“The top of the plant may die, but that doesn't mean the plant is necessarily dead,” says Buchanan, who adds that owners shouldn’t necessarily rip out plants that seem “brown and dead,” as they may regenerate in the spring.\nA team member at East Austin Succulents demonstrates on\nAdding incandescent lights under the blankets which will raise the temperatures on the ground and around the plant, Buchanan notes. Then, cover with frost cloth or blankets. He advises against plastic, as it can burn leaves, unless it’s on top of the blankets. “But it’s best just to avoid plastic,” he adds.\nIf time, Buchanan says mulching flower beds adds extra insulation for plants and helps guarantee a spring return.\nPipes\nMaster plumber and owner of\nAll The Time Plumbing Thomas Moreno says that the No. 1 freeze prep for pipes is to turn off and drain the backflow preventer to the yard's sprinkler (if applicable). \"All you really need is a flathead screwdriver to drain it and it will stop the plastic diaphragm from breaking,\" he tells us.\nMoreno shares video tips below:\nCover pipes with insulation or old towels and and wrap with duct tape, and faucets with covers (found at any hardware store) or duct tape and towels.\nInside, open cabinets that house plumbing fixtures to allow hot air to get into cabinets and let faucets trickle if they face an outside wall on the other side.\nThose who won't be home or are prepping additional homes or rentals should shut the water main off and drain all faucets.\nLeaving and turning off the water? Don't forget to flush toilets to get all water out of the tanks. \"During the 2021 freeze, a lot of toilet tanks froze because people weren't there,\" Moreno says, \"but the tanks cracked. We must've replaced 50 toilet tanks.\"\nPools\nHouston real estate expert Paige Martin enlisted\nNabors Pools for some freeze tips.\nPools that have automation such as Pentair Easytouch, Hayward OmniLogic, or Jandy Aqualink, should have freeze protection already built into the system. If equipment is properly set up with functional censors — and electricity is running — no action is needed.\nCheck pools with timers and a variable speed pump with a display or control panel (located at the back of the pump) for freeze protection (if enabled).\nFor pools with timers and a single-speed pump without Wi-Fi control, app, remote, panel, or alternative control mechanisms, adjust the pump to run continuously during freezing temperatures to avoid damage.\nImportant reminder: Water temperature is more important than the air temperature. If water temperature is well above freezing, no action is needed. When in doubt, keep the water moving, circulating, and pumps running for safety.\nIn the event that the area loses electricity, turn off all breakers and drain the equipment — if it's safe. Those unsure of how to do this can watch this\nvideo.\nCars\nMatt Burrage of\nTexas-German Autohaus reminds drivers to flush out water from their wipers and fill washer fluid — compatible for freezes — and run it for one minute.\nKeep cars in garages if possible, and ensure that coolant systems have actual antifreeze and not just water. \"Freezes make the water in those systems expand,\" says Burrage, the result is cracked parts that overheat when the car finally drives — and the car overheats.\nDon't surprise to see low-tire warning after the freeze (cold air compresses air in tires.) Burrgage notes that local Discount Tire shops have seen 200 cars at a time in line for the tire pressure station. Owners of older cars should ensure batteries are tested and oil has been changed — preferably to synthetic.\nSpeaking of cold, cars, and animals: it's always smart to honk the horn or beat the hood to warn and critters in the car that have sought shelter.\n\"Nine years ago, a man called us and said he heard a cat meowing in his car,\" says Burrage. The man (for some reason) drove 25 minutes to Burrage, whose team extracted a kitten that had desperately clung to the transmission for warmth.\nThankfully, the story has a happy ending: A (rather annoyed) Burrage gave the cold, lonely, terrified kitten to a staffer, who adopted and named it — fittingly — Mercedes.\nCultureMap will update this story with any breaking news.",

    "text": "In a landmark initiative to address rising suicide cases in Pakistan, psychiatrists and geneticists have launched the first collaborative genetic study to investigate the underlying causes of suicide in the Thar region and the surrounding districts. The study project aims to understand the genetic, psychological and environmental factors contributing to the suicides in rural Sindh, where their cases have increased alarmingly. In this regard a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on Thursday by the Sindh Mental Health Authority (SMHA), the Department of Genetics at the University of Karachi, and the Department of Psychiatry at the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS). The MoU signing ceremony held in the KU Vice Chancellor Conference Room was attended by KU VC Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi, SMHA Chairman Senator Dr Karim Ahmed Khawaja, DUHS Registrar Dr Ashar Afaq, and several other prominent faculty and health officials. Dr Iraqi emphasised that this pioneering research has the potential to uncover genetic predispositions to mental health conditions like depression and substance abuse that might increase susceptibility to suicide. Dr Khawaja expressed the urgency for the project, noting that the SMHA has documented a rise in suicide cases in Tharparkar, Jamshoro, Dadu and other districts, with the trend raising concerns over mental health in these communities. “This initiative is a milestone for Pakistan. Suicide is a complex issue, and understanding its genetic components will allow us to develop preventive measures to support affected communities.” Under the agreement, KU’s Department of Genetics will conduct DNA analyses and examine biological samples to identify genetic markers linked to mental health issues, the SMHA will assess mental health challenges within families, and the DUHS’s Department of Psychiatry will facilitate case identification and data collection from the affected communities. The three institutions will collaborate on a comprehensive survey and questionnaire, reaching out to families impacted by suicide in order to gather genetic samples and data. The significance of the project was highlighted by KU’s project coordinator and psychology department faculty member, Prof Dr Farah Iqbal, who pointed out the broad impact of suicide on families and communities, stressing that this research can help guide future interventions and mental health services. Prof Dr Maqsood Ali Ansari, chairperson of KU’s genetics department, expressed optimism that the research would help uncover root causes of suicides in Thar, and provide insights that can benefit public health policies across the country. Dr Washdev Amar, head of DUHS’s psychiatry department, said the Covid-19 pandemic had exacerbated mental health challenges globally, a trend also reflected in Sindh, where suicide cases in rural districts have seen significant spikes. He explained that understanding both genetic and environmental influences is critical to forming a holistic approach to suicide prevention. Prof Dr Musarrat Jahan Yousuf, dean of KU’s Faculty of Science, noted that comprehensive research like this might reveal further factors involved in suicidal tendencies, from genetic influences to social pressures. Dr Iraqi said that mental health is often overlooked, yet it is vital to a person’s overall well-being. He expressed hope that the collaborative efforts and shared resources from the three institutions would lead to valuable insights, guiding policies and resources to support mental health care in the country. The MoU was formally signed by Dr Khawaja, Dr Afaq and Dr Ansari, setting the foundation for a study poised to make substantial contributions to mental health research and preventive care in the country.
