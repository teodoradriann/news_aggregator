    "text": "Dwight Howard Critiques Rudy Gobert’s 4th DPOY Win as Unwarranted\nRudy Gobert recently won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year Award, making him one of only three players to achieve this feat. However, Dwight Howard criticized Gobert, claiming he is not an elite defender and only thrives in a team setting. Howard argues that Gobert's recognition comes from his support system rather than individual prowess, although he acknowledges Gobert's impact in pick-and-roll situations this season. Other NBA personalities have joined the debate, suggesting that alternative candidates, like Victor Wembanyama, were more deserving based on individual defensive contributions.By the Numbers\n- Rudy Gobert has won 4 Defensive Player of the Year Awards.\n- Dwight Howard won 3 Defensive Player of the Year Awards during his career.\nWhile some criticize Gobert's individual defense, others point out his significant contributions to team defense, highlighting the complexity of evaluating defensive players in different contexts.State of Play\n- Gobert's communication skills significantly improved the\nTimberwolves' defensive performance this season.\n- NBA voices like Gilbert Arenas and Jeff Teague challenge Gobert’s individual defensive abilities and question the merit of his DPOY awards.\nThe ongoing debate about Gobert's defensive credentials may influence future award considerations and how defensive stats are valued in the league.Bottom Line\nThe conversation around Rudy Gobert's Defensive Player of the Year awards raises important questions about the meritocracy of individual defensive accolades versus team contributions in the NBA.\nRead more at\n The SportsRush\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "WOODHAVEN, Mich. – For decades, the Allen Road Canadian National rail crossing in Woodhaven has been a nightmare for drivers.\n“One day I got caught three times by the train, just going in and out,” said Elaine Melnar, who has lived in Woodhaven for decades. “It’s been a headache ever since I moved in ’79.”\nMore than 30,000 vehicles, including 2,100 commercial trucks, traverse the crossing daily. Train passages cause average delays of nine minutes, accumulating to roughly an hour of total stoppage time each day, according to Wayne County.\n“You can run up to the store, you can get stopped on the way there and start back (and get stopped). You got about a half hour each way sometimes,” Woodhaven resident Steve Mosley said.\nA $65 million infrastructure project began this week to eliminate this traffic headache.\nScheduled for completion in November 2027, the project aims to separate vehicle and train traffic at the rail crossing.\n“We’re going to drop the vehicular road down a little bit. We’re going to raise the rail line up a little bit to be able to create that separation so the rail, the train, can do its thing, and vehicles can do their thing,” Wayne County Department of Public Services Director Dayo Akinyemi said.\nThe current phase focuses on relocating utility lines to prepare for the rail bridge construction. While this preliminary work won’t significantly impact traffic, the project’s main phase will require a complete closure of the crossing.\n“We’re going to have a complete closure and detour, but that is at least a good 12 to 18 months from now,” Akinyemi said. “We’re going to make a different level of outreach to the community and educate them.”\nAs part of this project, there will be a pump station installed to prevent flooding on Allen Road under the rail bridge.\nFor more information on the project, click here.",

    "title": "How J.J. McCarthy’s improved health can benefit Michigan’s offense",
    "text": "How J.J. McCarthy’s improved health can benefit Michigan’s offense Through the first seven games of the 2023 season, [J.J. McCarthy](https://www.on3.com/db/jj-mccarthy-50402/) used his legs effectively as he took 27 carries for 160 yards and three touchdowns. In his ensuing six games, though, those numbers dropped as McCarthy took 30 carries for -14 yards and failed to find the end zone with his legs — a different style than [Michigan](https://www.on3.com/teams/michigan-wolverines/) deployed at first. The change came as a result of a lower leg injury McCarthy suffered at some point mid-year. Ahead of the Big Ten Championship, he said he was fully healthy, and he’s had five weeks since that game to get even more rest ahead of the Rose Bowl against [Alabama](https://www.on3.com/teams/alabama-crimson-tide/). McCarthy’s health will be paramount for Michigan in that game, according to [The Wolverine’s](https://www.on3.com/teams/michigan-wolverines/) [Clayton Sayfie](https://www.on3.com/user/claytonsayfie/). If his leg is back to 100%, the Wolverines can get back to getting McCarthy into the run game — a part of his game that will be essential against a tough Alabama defense. “You saw that in the beginning of the year, and then they would kind of dial back a lot of the designed run stuff to try to keep him upright, keep him clean, not use it when they don’t have to,” Sayfie told [Andy Staples](https://www.on3.com/user/andy-staples/) on [Andy Staples On3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxJrRcHc-0). “I think that could play a part in this game, too — not just his ability to extend the plays and throw downfield. Honestly, too, some of his better plays have been when there’s a breakdown in offensive line protection.” The blueprint for the game could come from an unlikely source. When [Auburn](https://www.on3.com/teams/auburn-tigers/) took Alabama down to the final play, [Payton Thorne](https://www.on3.com/db/payton-thorne-95972/) — Michigan fans know that name from his time at [Michigan State](https://www.on3.com/teams/michigan-state-spartans/) — had 57 rushing yards on 15 carries. The Tigers looked like they were going to pull off the upset before [Jalen Milroe](https://www.on3.com/db/jalen-milroe-54407/) found [Isaiah Bond](https://www.on3.com/db/isaiah-bond-49370/) on the well-documented 4th and 31. That type of game plan could be the key for Michigan in the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines’ running game remains potent with the two-headed monster of [Blake Corum](https://www.on3.com/db/blake-corum-10804/) and [Donovan Edwards](https://www.on3.com/db/donovan-edwards-38163/) in the backfield. Adding McCarthy’s legs to that would make things even tougher on the Crimson Tide. “Watching that Auburn game against Alabama and what Auburn did. [Hugh Freeze](https://www.on3.com/db/hugh-freeze-134705/), give him a ton of credit for what they did with their offensive game plan,” Sayfie said. “They complete [five] passes in that game from the quarterback spot … and you wouldn’t think that that would be some sort of blueprint that they’re looking at going into a college football playoff. “Michigan’s got to do a bunch of other stuff. They also got to stick with what they do. But I think they can do some of what Auburn did in the designed run game for JJ McCarthy. They’ve held it back all year. You’d see it a couple times here and there. But this is a time where you break it out.” Michigan will look to learn from ‘big regret’ with JJ McCarthy’s running ability during last year’s CFP When Michigan and [TCU](https://www.on3.com/college/tcu-horned-frogs/) went back-and-forth in last year’s Fiesta Bowl, McCarthy’s legs became a big part of the second-half offense. He had 10 carries for 57 yards as the Wolverines’ narrowly lost to the Horned Frogs 51-45. It marked the second straight loss in the CFP for Michigan. The hope is the third time will be the charm. The Wolverines could try to avoid holding McCarthy back too long again. After all, they’re facing a mobile quarterback in Jalen Milroe, as well. If Michigan can get JJ McCarthy on the move, that could help in some key short-yargdage situations. “Last year, they didn’t do that against TCU until the second half,” Sayfie said. “It’s a big regret, and it worked really well against that defense. You’ve got to use that. “I think this game’s also going to come down to a lot of 3rd-and-shorts, 3rd-and-mediums for Michigan and whether or not you can stay on the field. Because Alabama’s gonna stay on the field with Milroe, probably. But then again, it’s a key for them, too. So it’s another cliche. Third down, red zone. But there’s so much that goes into it.”",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia Sent Its 53rd Relief Plane for Gaza",
    "text": "The conflict in Gaza has resulted in many people struggling with acute malnutrition because of the lack of sufficient food being delivered and the inability of health care clinics to provide services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 8,000 children aged less than 5 who have been diagnosed with acute malnutrition , with 1,600 of them diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition.\nFurthermore, as of May 21, 2024, only one-third of the 36 hospitals in Gaza still function, which impacts thousands of Gazans struggling with urgent health issues. As a result, countries such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and organizations such as the United Nations (U.N.) have utilized their resources to aid the people through food and medical assistance.\nThe King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center On June 12, 2024, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief), delivered its 53rd relief plane for Gaza to help the people severely impacted by the fighting. KSRelief’s 53rd relief plane for Gaza contained food and medical supplies to alleviate the pain of the Gazans. The aircraft arrived at Egypt’s El-Arish International Airport to be transferred across the border to Gaza. This highlights the importance of international collaboration in providing aid to Gazans when the conflict has rendered humanitarian assistance almost impossible.\nKSRelief’s 53rd relief aircraft for Gaza reflects Saudi Arabia’s consistent support for the people enduring pain and suffering in Gaza and Palestine as a whole. For example, on March 20, 2024, KSRelief announced that it provided $40 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to help with its life-saving operations in Gaza.\nFurthermore, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia raised more than $100 million for Gaza and Palestine via its “Sahem” national portal, which allows Saudi citizens to donate money to support humanitarian aid. Saudi Arabia’s national and multilateral efforts to help Gaza and Palestine as a whole have been a beacon of hope for those severely impacted by the fighting.\nInternational Organizations at the Forefront International humanitarian organizations have also been working extensively to help the people in Gaza since the war started on October 7, 2023, despite the immense challenges facing them. For example, as of June 6, 2024, the WHO has supplied essential trauma emergency kits and kits for noncommunicable diseases and severe acute malnutrition to those most affected by the conflict.\nIn addition, in May 2024, the World Food Programme (WFP) provided food aid to more than a million people in Gaza and the West Bank despite reducing rations due to access constraints. This illustrates how international humanitarian organizations have been unwavering in their determination to help Gaza even as the fighting intensifies.\nHumanitarian Aid andEnding the War in Gaza Although people have been inundated with horrific stories about Gaza, there have also been many instances where countries such as Saudi Arabia and international organizations such as the WHO are working tirelessly to help the people and give them hope. KSRelief’s 53rd relief plane for Gaza shows how regional countries have been working hard not just to provide aid but to put an end to the war and hopefully bring peace to them and the entire Middle East.\nOn the other hand, the WFP’s courageous efforts to deliver food to Gaza despite access constraints show how even actors outside the region want to help end the fighting. This highlights how humanitarian aid is not just a short-term solution to this war but a tireless effort to bring lasting peace to people who endure pain daily.\n– Abdullah Dowaihy\nAbdullah is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and focuses on Good News and Global Health for The Borgen Project.\nPhoto: Flickr",

Sport 1 week ago He has also now scored at each of the venues in SA where he has played a Test match.\nThis performance will live long in his memory.\nThursday dawned brightly, with play able to start at the scheduled 10am for the first time in the match.\nThe ball continued to play tricks off the surface with Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Siraj able to get even a 70-over old ball to jag off the pitch past the outside edge, while the inconsistent bounce had Elgar troubled occasionally, especially one from Siraj that kept low.\nWith him, Marco Jansen looked increasingly confident as he notched up a second Test 50, which he turned into a highest score in this format by the interval of 72 not out.\nHis driving was impressive, especially through the cover region, while his defence was also rock solid.\nIndia had many moments: balls from Bumrah and Siraj beat the outside edge, while Ravi Ashwin found the edge of Jansen’s bat, but KL Rahul couldn’t react quickly enough to take the chance.\nFive top plays from another enthralling day’s Test cricket The Proteas are edging an advantage after two days' play in the first Test against India in Centurion. TimesLIVE identifies the top five plays of the ... Sport 1 week ago Jansen and Elgar added 111 runs for the sixth wicket, before Elgar’s innings was ended by Thakur.\nTwice in Elgar’s innings, once on Wednesday and then on Thursday morning, he had gloved a short ball in the gap between the wicketkeeper and slip for four, and on a third occasion, the ball glanced the glove, giving Rahul an easy catch.\nGerald Coetzee swung lustily for his 19 off 18 balls, until trying his luck one too many times and lifting Ashwin to Siraj at mid-off.\nJansen’s innings has already lasted 120 balls and included nine fours and a six, and with the pitch continuing to show signs of inconsistency, any runs SA can eke out of the last few wickets will prove invaluable.\nThere was still no sign of whether skipper Temba Bavuma, who is undergoing treatment for a hamstring strain will bat, but it might be worth the risk given that batting will only get harder as the match unfolds.",

    "text": "El presidente de la República y el vicepresidente, Santiago Peña y Pedro Alliana, se interiorizaron sobre las obras de desarrollo que están siendo impulsadas en el departamento de Ñeembucú. Observaron así los avances generados en infraestructura y conectividad, resaltando además el progreso integral que comienza a priorizarse en los distritos del territorio. “Pilar se está convirtiendo en un símbolo del turismo a nivel nacional. Estoy convencido de que este año, Ñeembucú y Pilar van a mostrar sus mejores galas; hay muchos proyectos para el departamento y estamos seguros de que los próximos años serán muy importantes”, manifestó el mandatario durante los recorridos realizados. En cuanto a los proyectos de vivienda, destacó el trabajo que se está potenciando con el Ministerio de Desarrollo Social (MDS) para llevar a cabo planes sociales que constituyan una respuesta directa a las principales urgencias de los pilarenses, como lo es el acceso a una vivienda propia. Con estas articulaciones, Peña garantizó el progreso en Ñeembucú como nunca antes se había observado.

La dupla del Ejecutivo afirmó que continuará trabajando de manera conjunta con el Legislativo y la Gobernación de Ñeembucú para apuntalar otra serie de proyectos en el departamento e instalar el desarrollo que ha sido postergado en las administraciones anteriores. “No hay mejor promotor e impulsor del progreso en Ñeembucú que el propio Alliana”, expresó el mandatario.
