    "text": "Dense fog disrupts transport in North India, red alert issued\nHeavy fog continued to disrupt transportation across North India, causing delays in numerous flights and trains on Friday.\nThe\n[India Meteorological Department (IMD)]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/india-meteorological-department-imd ) forecasted that very dense fog conditions will last until Tuesday (January 2), with cold day conditions anticipated in [Delhi]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/delhi ), Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh.\nMoroever, a red alert has been issued over foggy conditions for [Punjab]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/punjab ), Haryana, and Delhi on Friday and an orange alert for Saturday. Punjab has an orange alert warning until Sunday.\nWhy does this story matter?\nAs the\n[cold wave]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/cold-wave ) continues to grip North India, most states and union territories have been blanketed by dense fog.\nThick fog across the Indo-Gangetic Plain and snowfall in hilly areas have severely affected commutes, especially as people gather to celebrate New Year holidays.\nOn Wednesday, over 100 flights at [Delhi's IGI Airport]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/indira-gandhi-international-airport ) were disrupted. Multiple road accidents were also reported in neighboring states.\nVideos and photos online showed people taking refuge in shelter homes to beat the freezing conditions.\nLow visibility impacts trains and flights\nThe thick fog has significantly affected train services, with many running 10-12 hours behind schedule. The Northern Railway stated that the impacted trains include the Rajdhani Express on the Delhi-Howrah route. Flight operations have also been disrupted, with visibility recorded at 150 meters in Delhi, slightly better compared to the last two days. The IMD has also asked people to get in touch with concerned airlines, railways, and state transport authorities for updates regarding the journey schedules.\nIMD predicts Delhi's minimum temperature to remain around 7 degrees\nIn a respite to residents, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius on Friday, up from 8.4 degrees Celsius the day before. However, the IMD predicted the minimum temperature will remain around 7-8 degrees Celsius over the next five days. It has cautioned people not to venture out early in the morning, particularly between 4:00am and 10:00am. A fresh western disturbance might hit northwestern India from Friday, triggering rain or snow until Monday in the hilly regions.\nRoad accidents increase amid dense fog\nAt least six people died and 12 others were injured in two separate\n[road accidents]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/road-accidents ) in Uttar Pradesh due to low visibility on Thursday.\nEarlier that day, four people were killed and six injured in separate road collisions because of dense fog.\nThe IMD has advised drivers to use fog lights and exercise caution while driving or using any mode of transportation.\nNotably, schools in Gautam Buddh Nagar, including Noida and Greater Noida, remain closed due to cold conditions.",

    "title": "Terrificante frana dopo il terremoto nei Campi Flegrei: lo spaventoso video",
    "text": "sismografo terremoto Una frana a Monte di Procida, causata da un terremoto di magnitudo 2,6 nei Campi Flegrei, ha seminato il panico tra i bagnanti. Nel primo pomeriggio dell’11 luglio, Monte di Procida, un incantevole comune costiero in provincia di Napoli, è stato teatro di un improvviso e drammatico terremoto con conseguente frana. Un costone di roccia situato nei pressi di una frequentata spiaggia è franato, sollevando un enorme polverone e seminando il panico tra i bagnanti presenti. Sismografo terremoto Il crollo del Costone a Monte di Procida La frana è avvenuta poco dopo un terremoto di magnitudo 2,6 che aveva colpito i vicini Campi Flegrei. Una vasta area vulcanica conosciuta per la sua attività sismica. Il suono dei detriti in caduta e la vista del polverone hanno scatenato momenti di grande paura tra i presenti, molti dei quali hanno immediatamente registrato il crollo con i loro dispositivi mobili. Condividendo poi i video sui social media. Nonostante il forte spavento, fortunatamente non si registrano feriti. Le autorità locali, insieme agli esperti geologi, sono intervenute rapidamente per valutare la stabilità del costone e prevenire ulteriori rischi per la sicurezza pubblica. Il terremoto ai Campi Flegrei Il terremoto che ha preceduto la frana si è verificato alle 11:59 ed è stato registrato dall’Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV). Con una magnitudo preliminare di 2,6, il sisma ha avuto il suo epicentro nella zona dei Pisciarelli, una località all’interno dei Campi Flegrei. Un’area conosciuta per la sua intensa attività geotermica e vulcanica. L’evento sismico è stato avvertito non solo a Monte di Procida, ma anche nelle vicine località di Quarto, Bacoli, Bagnoli e Agnano, nonché nella città di Pozzuoli e nei quartieri occidentali di Napoli. Questo terremoto fa parte di uno sciame sismico che ha interessato l’area per diversi mesi. Un periodo di particolare attività che ha mantenuto gli abitanti in stato di allerta. Gli esperti dell’Osservatorio Vesuviano stanno monitorando costantemente la situazione, raccogliendo dati sull’intensità e sulla profondità dei sismi, che in questo caso è stata stimata a circa 2,7 chilometri. Nonostante la vicinanza temporale e geografica tra il terremoto e la frana, al momento non ci sono prove certe di una connessione diretta tra i due eventi. Ulteriori rilevamenti e analisi saranno necessari per comprendere appieno le dinamiche della frana e garantire la sicurezza della zona.",

    "title": "Apple's browser rules deemed anticompetitive in the UK",
    "text": "Apple's rules about what developers can do within browsers is limiting innovation, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has determined, as part of its provisional findings from its browser investigation. Safari, Apple's browser In 2021, the CMA launched its Mobile Ecosystems Market Study, determining that Apple and Google had a duopoly in the realm of mobile ecosystems. While it was found that Apple and Google were in a position to determine how browsers work on iOS and Android, the CMA now says that Apple does restrict competition because of its rules. The provisional findings, released on Friday, say that Apple'd rules \"restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers.\" It also refers to the concerns of other browser producers who are \"unable to offer a full range of browser features, such as faster webpage loading on iPhone.\" Developers complained to the probe that they would like to use progressive web apps as a form of providing apps to users without downloading via the App Store. \"Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers,\" said CMA independent inquiry group chair Margot Daly. \"Through our investigation, we have provisionally found that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK.\" There were also elements about Apple's relationship with Google, including how the revenue-sharing agreement reduces \"financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers in iOS.\" The way users are presented with a choice of which browser to use was a problem, too, with Apple and Google able to manipulate choices to make Chrome and Safari the \"clearest or easiest option.\" The probe also examined mobile cloud gaming, and concerns over how cloud gaming apps were distributed in app storefronts, or in Apple's case, how they weren't. Apple did make changes during the course of the investigation to allow cloud gaming apps to be sold, and the probe has seen \"some evidence of such apps emerging.\" Because of this, the CMA has concluded that there is no need to intervene in mobile cloud gaming affairs for the moment. In its recommendations following the probe, the independent group behind it has advised for an investigation into Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems. This should be done under new digital markets competition rules that will come into force in 2025. This includes the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act that will allow the CMA to designate companies as having a Strategic Market Status for digital activities, and to intervene when necessary. These interventions will include an investigation, along with a recommended course of action to improve competitive market conditions. \"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,\" Apple said in a statement to AppleInsider. \"We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\" Apple continued \"We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart.\" \"We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\" An Apple-delayed probe The CMA probe was originally started in November 2022, but it quickly became stuck in January 2023, when Apple filed an appeal over the legal definition of a single word. It was a shock temporary win for Apple, overturned by the Court of Appeal in November 2023. Despite winning, the CMA decided to delay the restart of the investigation for a few weeks, doing so in January. A mixed result The preliminary findings are good and bad for Apple, in a few ways. For a start, the clearance on cloud gaming means it doesn't have to do more to appease the regulator on that front. Its existing cloud gaming policy changes is enough to satisfy the CMA for the moment. While mobile cloud gaming is less of a headache for Apple now, its other rules over browser activity is still a problem. In January, EU regulations forced Apple into allowing third-party browsers to use different browser engines, instead of being forced to use WebKit. While Apple did allow that to be the case in EU markets, the regulations didn't stretch beyond the continent's borders, so WebKit continued to be mandated. The CMA's ruling could eventually prompt Apple into doing the same for the UK, but again it wouldn't be something that affects the rest of the world.",

    "text": "Hundreds of Palm Beach County storm victims are busy assessing the damage and starting the rebuilding process after an F3-level tornado rampaged through Wellington, the Loxahatchee area, and Palm Beach Gardens. A brand-new Publix store in that city’s Avenir development, slated to open in three weeks, took a direct hit from the tornado. It ripped a huge hole in the roof and even damaged the foundation. It’s a total loss, and Palm Beach Gardens city officials told us that the building must be demolished and then rebuilt from scratch. “You know, you just don’t think it will happen to you, and not here, we don’t really have these kinds of tornadoes,” said Melody Russell. Her house was sidewiped by the twister. Her neighborhood looks like a war zone, with big trees snapped in two and vehicles tossed around like toy cars. The Hurricane season is on. Our meteorologists are ready.[Sign up for the NBC 6 Weather newsletter to get the latest forecast in your inbox.] “The power went out and it was just like you see in the movies, like the whole house was shaking and I was screaming so I don’t remember the sound, but my family says it was very loud, like a train, and then you could tell that it passed over us because everything just stopped,” Russell said. The level of damage in the tornado’s path is not something anyone here expected, because they were not inside the hurricane cone. Raj Belanger is a firefighter with Hialeah Fire-Rescue, a first responder who came home from work to something he would normally see while he’s on the job. His own roof was damaged, windows were blown out and cars were totaled. The tornado went over his house. Local “I don’t believe we were even under a hurricane watch or warning, I think we were in tropical storm watch or warning, but yeah, tornadoes, you hear about ‘em all the time on the TV and you hope that you’re not effected but when they do hit they beat you up pretty good,” Belanger said. His house has a leaking roof, no electricity and no water. I asked Belanger if it was an emotional situation. “Yeah, when I got home, my wife called me that evening, when I rolled up Wednesday evening, it’s just that shock people talk about, you can’t soak it all in immediately,” he said. Now, like everyone else who was in the path of the tornado, Belanger is in recovery mode. It’s tough physically, emotionally, and it’s expensive to get back up when you get punched so hard.",

    "title": "Court hearing on controversial new NC elections law ends with more questions than answers",
    "text": "Court hearing on controversial new NC elections law ends with more questions than answers A federal judge on Thursday ordered the North Carolina Democratic Party and the Republican-led state legislature to try working together to clear up a lawsuit over part of a controversial new elections law, as the 2024 elections fast approach. Also involved in the lawsuit — and now the potential settlement discussions requested by the judge — are an assortment of voting rights groups, as well as the state government officials in charge of elections administration. At issue is a new law, Senate Bill 747. It made a number of changes that will go into effect for the 2024 elections including stricter rules for mail-in voting, less strict rules for partisan poll observers and a change to how the state handles people who use same-day voter registration. The law has led to the state being sued at least three times by voting rights activists and political groups trying to stop different parts of it from going into effect. The law's Republican backers say it's intended to fight voter fraud or help improve voters' confidence in election security. The challengers say it's actually intended to harm Democrats' chances in future elections, in part by cracking down on methods of voting and voter registration more commonly used by college students, Black people, Hispanic people and others whose views tend to lean more liberal. One wide-ranging lawsuit challenging numerous parts of the law is moving forward separately. But two lawsuits that focus specifically on the changes to same-day voter registration were heard Thursday. Federal District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder said he wasn't sure if he had the power to block that part of the law from going into effect, as the North Carolina Democratic Party and voter outreach groups including Voto Latino and Down Home NC have asked for. They claim the law unconstitutionally deprives new voters of due process rights. When someone [signs up to vote during early voting](https://www.ncsbe.gov/registering/how-register/register-person-during-early-voting), they must prove their name and residence by showing a photo ID, bank statement, utility bill or other such document. They're then asked to name an address the state can send a postcard; if the postcard is sucessfully delivered their vote will count. But if it's returned as undeliverable by the U.S. Postal Service, the person will be ruled an ineligible voter and have their ballot thrown out. The opponents say their main concern is that there's no process for people who get rejected to prove they actually do live where they said they live. The state doesn't have to notify them, let alone give them an opportunity to state their case. It's an affront to the most fundamental right of American democracy, said NC Democratic Party attorney Seth Waxman, for supporters of the new law to argue \"that you can have your ballot not counted, and not be told or given an opportunity to address it.\" The State Board of Elections believes its hands are tied, pointing to a court ruling in a different lawsuit that elections officials believe prevents them from offering any type of due process to voters who think they've been unfairly prevented from having their votes counted. But GOP lawmakers disagree, saying that while they're not convinced such a system is needed, they don't think that other court ruling applies in this situation. Given that fundamental disagreement between the branch of government in charge of writing the laws and the branch in charge of executing the laws, the Democratic Party and other challengers say the judicial branch now needs to come in and resolve the issue, by forcing a due process system to be established. But District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder wasn't quite convinced, telling the various sides Thursday that it would be best if they worked it out themselves. \"It's a fixable problem,\" Schroeder said. \"The question is who fixes it.\" It remains unclear whether the political enemies on opposite sides of the case will have an appetite for compromise, although a spokesperson for the State Board of Elections said they're willing to work with all the various other parties in the case to reach a solution. After Thursday's hearing multiple lawyers and spokespeople for the more political sides in the lawsuit either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment. Schroeder gave them a week to talk and work out a resolution, whether that means passing a new law or reaching a formal agreement or any other potential solution. If not, he said, then it'll be up to him to decide whether or not to strike down the law as the challengers want. The fight over same-day registration Cracking down on same-day registration has been a goal of North Carolina Republicans for years; the new lawsuits claim that's because it's used disproportionately by college students, low-income people and minorities. Republican politicians who backed SB 747 when it passed this year said same-day registration poses the potential for fraud, as allowing people to vote on the same day they register is a process that could be abused. But a similar vetting process for same-day registration has been in place for decades, and in court the legislature has been unable to point to any proof of the mail verification system ever stopping a case of real or attempted voter fraud. Voter fraud of any type is incredibly rare, multiple recent election audits have shown in North Carolina and elsewhere. The Republicans' own expert witness also acknowledged n a deposition that the new law is incapable of catching fraud, lawyers for the challengers said Thursday. That's because people don't actually have to have mail sent to the residence they're claiming to live at, and can instead list a more generic mailing address like their office, a P.O. box or a college mailroom. Phil Strach, the legislature's attorney, said the mail verification system is still important to have as a backup that helps verify that would-be voters aren't providing forged documents when they sign up to vote. But the challengers say that beyond being incapable of serving that purpose, the system's lack of due process has the potential to also void thousands of legitimate ballots in 2024 and beyond. Opponents of a different part of the new law, which eliminates the state'sthree-daygrace period for mail-in ballots to be delivered after Election Day, have said that will similarly lead to hundreds or even thousands of legitimate ballots being thrown in the trash in the 2024 elections and beyond, unless stopped in court first. That provision wasn't a focus of the two lawsuits heard Thursday. On the mail verification system, on Thursday the challengers pointed to a case in Watauga County — home to Appalachian State University and one of the 25 North Carolina counties that voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 — where more than two dozen voters in a recent election had their mail from the elections board returned as undeliverable. But in every single Watauga County case, Voto Latino attorney Aria Branch said, it turned out that the voters were legitimate and that their mail had been returned because of mistakes made by poll workers or postal service employees. To not allow voters in 2024 to know that their ballots are being thrown out due to similar mistakes, she said, would be an injustice. \"That will happen over and over again,\" she said. \"And that will cause individuals, who are eligible, to be disenfranchised.\" Strach said many states don't offer same-day registration at all. So if the legislature wants to create extra hurdles for it, he said, they can — and a judge shouldn't jump in and stop it. \"People can quibble whether mail verification is a good final step, but that's what the legislature has chosen,\" he said. •Credits [Will Doran](/rs/bio/20718722/)",

    "text": "Online Avenova ® sales increase 14% for the quarter and 19% for the nine months Sales and marketing expenses declined 25% for the quarter and 18% for the nine months reflecting digital marketing optimization NovaBay ® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: NBY) reports financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n“Avenova sales through the online channel for the quarter increased 14% over the prior year, while we reduced our marketing spend by 25% in the same period as we further optimized our highly efficient digital marketing programs,” said Justin Hall, CEO of NovaBay. “We saw continued momentum in Avenova online sales into the current quarter. Sales through Amazon in October continued to be strong with a successful Prime Day event.”\nFinancial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include results from DERMAdoctor, which was divested on March 25, 2024 and is accounted for in discontinued operations. Financial information about discontinued operations is available under “Divestiture and Discontinued Operations” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) later today.\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nTotal sales, net for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.4 million. Essentially all net sales for the quarter were derived from sales of eyecare products. Total sales, net for the third quarter of 2023 were $2.5 million, which included $2.4 million from sales of eyecare products and $0.1 million from sales of wound care products.\nGross margin on net sales for the third quarter of 2024 was 65%, compared with 67% for the third quarter of 2023, with the change primarily due to changes in the product mix.\nSales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.9 million, a 25% decrease from $1.3 million for the prior-year period, reflecting continued efficiencies in digital advertising and lower consulting costs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.7 million, compared with $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, with the increase due to higher legal costs.\nAccretion of interest and amortization of discounts on convertible notes for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.1 million, compared with $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.2 million, or $0.60 per share. This compares with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2023 of $1.8 million, or $13.11 per share.\nNine Month Financial Results\nTotal sales, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $7.5 million, compared with $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross margin on net sales for the first nine months of 2024 was 67%, compared with 60% for the first nine months of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased 18% and G&A expenses increased 28%, both compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2024 was $7.4 million, or $3.97 per share, compared with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2023 of $7.5 million, or $79.58 per share.\nNovaBay had cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $2.9 million as of December 31, 2023. In July 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering raising gross proceeds of $3.9 million.\nAbout NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nNovaBay's leading product Avenova ® Lid & Lash Cleansing Spray is often recommended by eyecare professionals for blepharitis and dry eye disease. Manufactured in the U.S., Avenova spray is formulated with NovaBay's patented, proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid.
