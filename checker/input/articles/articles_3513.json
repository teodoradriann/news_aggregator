    "text": "HERMISTON, Ore.- The Farm-City Pro Rodeo , a premier Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association (PRCA) event and a true community celebration, is August 6-9 at the Eastern Oregon Trade and Event Center (EOTEC).\nNow in its 37 th year, the FCPR is a top 15 rodeo in the country, offering a $50,000 purse per event in 2025, with an expected payout of over $600,000.\nThe FCPR is a symbol of the connections between agriculture and community, and works to honor the farmers, ranchers and families of Eastern Oregon, while drawing elite contestants from around the country.\nA true community effort, the FCPR is made possible through the dedication of its board, volunteers, local sponsors, the rodeo athletes, and, especially, the Hermiston community.\nBeginnings\nKnown as a rodeo “for cowboys by cowboys,” the FCPR was built from the ground up, starting with David Bothum and Butch Knowles, two local cowboys, and their wives, Sid and Mary.\nBoth men were full-time professional rodeo athletes in the late 1980’s, traveling the nation to compete, when the idea of bringing a professional rodeo to Hermiston came about at a party after the 1987 rodeo season.\n“At the time we only had the junior rodeo at the Umatilla County Fair,” said Bothum. “So we decided to give it a try.”\nBothum, Knowles and early community supporters of a pro rodeo in Hermiston met with the Umatilla County Fair Board, presented their plan, and were ultimately granted permission to hold the first FCPR in August of 1988.\n“We were told by some people this would never work in Hermiston,” said Bothum. “That first night I looked around at empty stands an hour before the rodeo started and thought maybe they were right, but by rodeo time at 7:30 they were full.”\nEvolution\nOver the years, the FCPR has improved and grown in pretty much every way, from the physical infrastructure and amenities that support the rodeo, to the action in the arena and increased prize money.\n“The original concept was to be the best rodeo we could be, while continuously striving to get better,” said Jon Gill, a FCPR board member.\nWith support from the board, volunteers and the community, the FCPR eventually replaced the aging wooden bleachers in the arena, planted grass, built other structures, including Chute 8 to host public and private events, and helped get the Eastern Oregon Trade and Event Center (EOTEC) built.\nThe Farm-City Pro Rodeo has also been a trailblazing event in the sport of rodeo and was the first to implement the back-to-back format for contestants, meaning athletes competing in multiple rodeos at the same time can get their two events in without having to leave town and come back, cutting down on travel time and expenses for cowboys competing regionally or nationally.\nThe FCPR was also one of the first rodeos to feature performers, ensuring that local favorites or top athletes from the PRCA had the opportunity to make their runs in front of a crowd by changing the order of competition for the benefit of the fans.\n“The fans should always come first,” said Gill. “Whoever bought a ticket is the most important person here.”\nThe FCPR also contracts with multiple stock companies to ensure that the bulls, broncs and calves in the rodeo are fresh, and to provide an equal playing field for all athletes, regardless of the draw.\n“By 2009, we made sure we were a riding contest, not a drawing contest,” said Gill of the move that has led to the FCPR winning Remuda Awards for the best bucking stock.\nThe FCPR has also been recognized with multiple “Best Grounds” awards and the “Trailblazer” award for its implementation of breakaway roping.\nThrough the years, changes have also come to the FCPR from outside Hermiston, including the rodeo being televised in 2014, which necessitated lighting improvements in the arena.\n“The FCPR wants to be a premier event and our volunteers, sponsors and the community believe in what we’re doing,” said Gill.\nVolunteers make it happen\n“The only way this event happens is with our dedicated volunteers,” said Torrie Griggs, FCPR Marketing and Advertising Director. “They are the heart of the Farm-City Pro Rodeo.”\nThe FCPR is organized by an all-volunteer board made up of rodeo enthusiasts and community leaders who work year-round to make the rodeo happen every August.\nAccording to Griggs, it takes about 150 volunteers working in some capacity, from ticket sales and parking to setting up panels, and everything in between, to make the rodeo a success year after year.\n“I’ve been volunteering for over 15 years,” said Jami Erwert, a volunteer with the Farm-City Pro Rodeo Ladies, nine riders who make the Grand Entry into the arena with sponsor flags and the American flag to start the rodeo every night, as well as running victory laps for event champions and providing horses for judges. “Our board is amazing; they make it worth it to come out and support this event and to keep coming back.”\nSponsors\n“Hermiston is probably the most giving community in the world, and we couldn’t do this without our sponsors,” said Bothum.\nLes Schwab was the original sponsor of the FCPR back in 1988 and still supports the rodeo today.\n“We’ve had the privilege of being a sponsor of the Farm-City Pro Rodeo since day one,” said Dave Shockman, Manager of Les Schwab in Hermiston. “It’s a quality event for Hermiston, and we’re honored to still be involved 37 years later.”\nSponsoring the FCPR is a rather exclusive privilege, with a limited number of opportunities available, according to event organizers, a system that cultivates longstanding community support from businesses and organizations, such as Good Shepherd Health Care System (GSHCS), Lamb Weston, Umatilla Electric Cooperative and LiUNA, among others.\n“We’re a longtime, generational sponsor of the Farm-City Pro Rodeo,” said Robert Echenrode, President/CEO of Umatilla Electric Cooperative. “We helped support the development and building of the EOTEC and continue to support the rodeo.”\nGSHCS support for Hermiston’s hometown rodeo dates back many years, with this year’s sponsorship helping to elevate FCPR to a top 15 rodeo in the country.\n“At Good Shepherd Health Care System, we are honored to sponsor the Farm-City Pro Rodeo, a testament to our commitment to preserving health and wellness, and the rich legacy of rodeo culture in Eastern Oregon,” shared Art Mathisen, GSHCS President & CEO. “We are excited to see this year’s rodeo become one of the top rodeos in the nation. Together, we’re celebrating our community and ensuring this beloved tradition continues for many years to come where cowboys from all over the world can compete at the top of their game.”\nThe 2025 Farm-City Pro Rodeo\nIn 2025 top rodeo athletes from around the country will again compete in the FCPR, top stock contractors will bring world-class livestock to Hermiston, and equal payouts will be awarded across all PRCA and Women’s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) events.\n“We have the best cowboys and the best stock of the 750 rodeos in America this year,” said Bothum. “We’re definitely a top 15 rodeo.\nOver the four nights of rodeo the FCPR will also hold spotlight nights, including Family Night August 6, American Farmer Night August 7, First Responders Night on August 8, and Saturday, August 9 is the night to GET Wild at Farm-City Pro Rodeo.\nThe FCPR will also donate $1 for every ticket sold from August 8 to Tunnel to Towers , a nonprofit that works to provide housing for veterans and first responders.\nFor its 37 th anniversary, the FCPR has doubled the prize fund for 2025 and will offer a $50,000 purse per event, for a total estimated payout of around $600,000, according to event organizers.\n“We’ve got the whole rodeo world talking about what we’re doing in 2025,” said Gill. “The Farm-City Pro Rodeo is a tribute to Hermiston, this community, and our volunteers and sponsors.”\nThe FCPR is August 6-9, with the rodeo starting at 7:45 p.m. each night. Tickets are available online or by calling the FCPR box office at 541.564.8500.",

    "text": "Chennai: Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi has stoked yet another row, this time involving Tamil saint-poet Thiruvalluvar.\nThe Raj Bhavan did not merely observed Thiruvalluvar Thirunaal Vizha on May 24 instead of January 16 which has been the practice in the state, but also used a picture of the saint-poet in a saffron robe in the invitations sent to dignitaries.\nThiruvalluvar Day is celebrated on January 16 in the Tamil month of Thai (mid-January to mid-February) by the state government but the Governor’s office, for the first time, chose to organise a function on Friday to commemorate his birthday on the occasion of Vaikasi Anusham according to the Tamil calendar.\nThe picture used by the Governor was distinctly different from the one that is generally used by Tamil scholars and Tamil Nadu government – he is usually attired in a white robe. But the picture shared by the governor showed him wearing a saffron-colour robe and his forehead smeared with vibudhi, the scared ash worn by Hindus.\nIt was the BJP that in 2019 first used a picture of Thiruvalluvar in saffron robes, inviting criticism from several quarters.\nSources in the Governor’s office and BJP said it was the Dravidian parties that changed Thiruvalluvar Day from the Tamil month of Vaikasi (mid-May to mid-June) to Thai and that there was nothing wrong in restoring the tradition. “Thiruvalluvar was born in the month of Vaikasi and there is no doubt on that. He is a Hindu saint and there is nothing wrong in him being draped in a saffron robe,” a BJP leader told DH.\nOn Friday, the Governor paid floral tributes to the saffron-clad Thiruvalluvar picture at the Raj Bhavan. Thiruvalluvar’s attire has been a topic of debate for a very long time in Tamil Nadu after the then DMK government in the 1970s released the picture of the saint-poet created by K R Venugopal Sharma.\nHowever, several right-wing organisations have been accusing the DMK of “Dravidianising” the saint-poet. And this is not the first time that the governor has dragged Thiruvalluvar into controversy, in 2023, he had alleged that Tamil scholar G U Pope had presenting a “de-spiritualised version” of the book while translating it into English.\n‘Thirukkural’, penned by Thiruvalluvar, offers remedy or a piece of advice for every issue that the modern world encounters. The couplets also found mention in the budget speeches of P Chidambaram and Nirmala Sitharaman.\nThe DMK and AIADMK condemned the Governor for trying to “distort” history.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 24 May 2024, 15:39 IST",

    "text": "India fought back with four late wickets to leave Australia on 311 for six on day one of the fourth Test on Thursday after teen debutant Sam Konstas had lit up the Melbourne Cricket Ground with a thrilling knock in the morning.\nTempers rose in blazing heat in front of a bumper Boxing Day crowd of 87,242, with Virat Kohli booed by home fans after bumping shoulders with Konstas on the pitch after the 19-year-old smashed India’s bowlers around the park early on.\nKonstas shrugged off the clash on the way to scoring 60 from 65 balls as Australia’s top order rewarded captain Pat Cummins’s decision to bat after he won the toss.\n“It was quite surreal, obviously, with the big crowd, biggest crowd I’ve ever played in, and I feel like the boys welcomed me,” said Konstas, who has 11 first class matches under his belt.\n“So just playing with that freedom and backing myself and lucky to get a few runs today. Obviously a bit disappointed with the way I got out, but hopefully we get a bit of momentum for tomorrow.”\nIt was left to Jasprit Bumrah to keep India in the fight, the pace spearhead bowling danger man Travis Head for a duck with the ageing ball and getting all-rounder Mitchell Marsh to nick behind for four.\nSeamer Akash Deep later chipped in with the wicket of Alex Carey for 31, breaking a rapid, 53-run partnership with Steve Smith.\nSmith was 68 not out, with tailender Cummins on eight.\nHaving sailed past 150 for the loss of one wicket, Australia were only narrowly ahead of the game by stumps.\nOpener Usman Khawaja and number three Marnus Labuschagne both squandered chances for drought-breaking centuries.\nKhawaja pulled Bumrah straight to KL Rahul at midwicket to be out for 57 before tea and Labuschagne was caught for 72 trying to slog all-rounder Washington Sundar over mid-off. Labuschagne’s wicket ended an 83-run partnership with Smith as Australia lost three wickets for nine runs.\nKonstas earlier had the crowd in the palm of his hand as he took to Bumrah with gusto and got under the visitors’ skin.\nAn irked Kohli bumped shoulders with him at the end of the 10th over and he shrugged off a barrage of invective from paceman Mohammed Siraj.\nTrapped lbw by Ravindra Jadeja after the second drinks break, Konstas trudged off with huge cheers and the third quickest half-century (50 from 52 balls) by an Australian test debutant behind Adam Gilchrist and Ashton Agar.\nKonstas, replacing the dropped Nathan McSweeney in the side, had promised to keep things simple with a “see ball hit ball” approach in his first test.\nBut Bumrah beat his bat four times in the first over before Konstas whipped two off his pads to get off the mark, triggering a roar from the crowd.\nIndia’s players sniggered when Konstas failed to put bat on ball with two botched ramp shots against Bumrah but he wiped the smiles from their faces with a four, a six and another four with his next three efforts in the quick’s fourth over.\nDancing down the wicket at Siraj, he swung and missed at a ball, prompting a long stare and some choice words from the fiery quick, who was booed by the crowd. Konstas charged Siraj again on the next delivery to hit him for three.\nWith the five-Test series level at 1-1 after the Gabba test was drawn, India dropped Shubman Gill and listed out-of-form skipper Rohit Sharma at number three.\nIndia assistant coach Abhishek Nayar said Rohit would likely return to his traditional opening role, though, after scoring a total of 19 runs batting at six in the second and third Tests.\nBRIEF SCORES (Fourth Test, Day 1)\nAustralia 311 for 6 (Labuschagne 72, Smith 68*, Konstas 60, , Bumrah 3-75) vs India (yet to bat)\n[Sports](/sports)\nIndia fight back after wonder boy Konstas shines\nTempers rise in heat in front of a big Boxing Day crowd of 87,242\nIndia’s Akash Deep bowls to Australia’s Sam Konstas (also inset) on the first day of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on Thursday.
