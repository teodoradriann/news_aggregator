    "title": "See Pedro Pascal Suit Up As MCU Reed Richards For ‘Fantastic Four’ In Amazing Concept Design",
    "text": "Pedro Pascal has finally found his way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and jaw-dropping concept designs have already hit the net following his casting as Reed Richards in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot.\nThe MCU’s Fantastic Four reboot was announced way back in 2019. Despite this, nearly nothing is known about the project, including who may or may not join the cast of Marvel’s first family. This all changed in November 2023, however, when it was revealed that\nPedro Pascal was in deep talks to play Reed Richards in the project.\nWith Pedro Pascal being the internet’s favorite father figure, social media immediately blew up with speculation and concept designs for his upcoming portrayal of Mister Fantastic. The art below, created by digital artist “\nSpdrmnkyxxiii” on Instagram, shows off Pascal as Reed Richards in his iconic Fantastic Four suit:\nPedro Pascal’s casting as Reed Richards would make him the fourth actor to bring the head of Marvel’s first family to live-action. Ioan Gruffudd first played the role in 2005’s Fantastic Four, with Miles Teller taking up the mantle from him in the 2015 reboot. John Krasinski also famously had a cameo as Mister Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\nThe Fantastic Four casting rumors won’t stop\nDespite the litany of rumors surrounding the MCU’s Fantastic Four reboot, Pedro Pascal didn’t even seem to be on leakers’ radars. Instead,\n Jake Gyllenhaal was actually said to be the frontrunner for the role of Mister Fantastic. Other actors said to be up for the role before him also include Matt Smith, Adam Driver, and Dev Patel.\nUp next is Sue Storm, with reports claiming that she’ll take center stage in the upcoming reboot. While\n Vanessa Kirby is said to be the frontrunner for the role, actresses ranging from Emma Stone to Margot Robbie have all been rumored to join Marvel’s new take on the Fantastic Four.\nJohnny Storm and Ben Grimm have also had their fair share of rumors. The Bear star\nEbon Moss-Bachrach has long been rumored to play The Thing, and both Stranger Things breakout Joseph Quinn and Normal People star Paul Mescal are said to have been offered the role of The Human Torch. RUMOR: Marvel Studios Eyeing ‘The Walking Dead’ Veteran To Replace Jonathan Majors As The MCU’s Kang\nThe titular Fantastic Four aren’t the only characters Marvel is looking to cast for the reboot. Both\nJavier Bardem and Antonio Banderas have been said to play the film’s rumored main villain Galactus. Cillian Murphy is also said to be Marvel’s top choice to play Doctor Doom, with the character expected to play a key role in the MCU’s future despite not playing a large role in the film.\nRegardless of who ends up playing the first family in Marvel’s Fantastic Four reboot, it’s clear that casting is off to a strong start with Pedro Pascal taking up the role of Mister Fantastic. Here’s to hoping that his version of Reed Richards is propped up by a truly stellar supporting cast, lest the MCU try to reboot its first family one more time!",

    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.

    "text": "DETROIT (FOX 2) - A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for most of southeast Michigan as a snow system moves into Metro Detroit just in time for Friday&apos;s commute.\nThe flakes started flying around 5:15 Friday morning for most of Metro Detroit – and in the northern communities, it started to stick pretty quickly.\nIt&apos;s leading to dozens of crashes reported across Metro Detroit – with freeways across the entire area slowing down.\nAround 6 a.m. on Friday, a winter weather advisory was posted for Oakland County, Macomb County, St. Clair County, Livingston County, Lapeer County. The advisory means that the National Weather Service is concerned about a possible threat to life or property because of the weather.\nGet location-based weather alerts on your mobile device by downloading the FOX 2 weather app and allowing notifications.\nThe snow is also leading to a large amount of school closings coming in. These are mostly in central and northern counties. Check the list of closings here.\nDrivers should expect limited visibility for the commute to work with the heaviest stuff expected to be done by 8 a.m.\nAll told, we&apos;re not looking at a ton of snow – we&apos;re talking between 1 and 4 inches by the time the snow system is done. However, we haven&apos;t seen much snow over the winter so this spring snowmaker could catch many drivers by surprise. Even with the heaviest stuff early in the morning – that doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;ll be done for the day.\nThe snow will continue throughout the morning and most of the afternoon. By 10:00 PM on Friday night we should begin to see some of it tapering off.\nThe snow will not be falling consistently during this timeframe, however. We will see periods where it will start and stop depending on where the heavy moisture lines up. Of course, this will play a role in official totals, which will vary by location.\nStarting in the southern communities of Lenawee and Monroe counties, snow totals will be significantly less. An inch or less of snow is expected, while some areas may not get any at all.\nTraveling north into Washtenaw and Wayne counties, we expect between 1-2 inches for most locales. The higher numbers will be further north still in Oakland, Macomb and Livingston Counties. This \"zone\" will receive between 2-3 inches with some spots perhaps getting slightly higher than that.\nThe bullseye of the snowmaker will be in mid-Michigan where they could get between 4 and 7 inches of snow.\nThe good news is that we&apos;ll be in the 40s by the weekend and 50s next week. Which means this snow won&apos;t stay long.",

Ignoring the advice, the couple continued their relationship, prompting the priest to perform rituals, linking it to the subsequent death of Abena Mama. The priest said a failure comply with these demands could lead to severe consequences on the family. As a result of the warning, the deceased woman’s body has been left untouched in a room five days after her death, gradually decomposing.

    "title": "2024 Kia Sportage review",
    "text": "The\nKia Sportage has long been popular in Australia – and driving the GT-Line 2.0D AWD I can see why.\nThe Sportage competes with the likes of the Hyundai Tucson, Mazda CX-5, Mitsubishi Outlander, Nissan X-Trail and Toyota RAV4. It shares some of its bits with the Tucson; although, its cousin comfortably outsells the Sportage by over 5500 units, based on VFACTS figures from January to November 2023.\nFor more Motoring related news and videos check out\nMotoring >>\nThe Sportage possesses a lot of great features but does Kia miss the mark on attention to detail? Little things that could make a big difference in practicality seem to be overlooked. For a family flagship SUV the lack of rear window shades, climate controls in the second row, engine stop/start functionality and head-up display surely must combine to affect the vehicle’s score…\nLet’s get into it and see.\nHow much does the Kia Sportage cost?\nThe flagship Kia Sportage GT-Line Diesel is priced from $52,720 before on-road costs.\nThis puts it closely in line with the Mitsubishi Outlander Exceed AWD, Honda CR-V VTi L AWD and cousin Hyundai Tucson Highlander N Line AWD.\nIt’s worth mentioning that while Kia is yet to release the Sportage Hybrid – due here in 2024 – the GT Line Diesel competes on pricing with the Honda ZR-V e:HEV LX and Subaru Forester Hybrid S.\n2024 Kia Sportage pricing:\nSmartstream G2.0 FWD\n- Sportage S: $32,795/$34,795 (6MT/6AT)\n- Sportage SX: $35,350/$37,350 (6MT/6AT)\n- Sportage SX+: $41,850 (6AT)\nSmartstream G1.6 T-GDI AWD\n- Sportage SX+: $43,850 (7DCT)\n- Sportage GT-Line: $49,720 (7DCT)\nSmartstream D2.0 AWD\n- Sportage S: $40,195 (8AT)\n- Sportage SX: $42,750 (8AT)\n- Sportage SX+: $47,250 (8AT)\n- Sportage GT-Line: $52,720 (8AT)\nAll pries exclude on-road costs.\nTo see how the Sportage compares with its rivals, line it up side-by-side with any car you want using our\ncomparison tool.\nWhat is the Kia Sportage like on the inside?\nBeing the top-spec model, Kia has put about every feature possible inside the cabin. Let’s start with the seats.\nThe Sportage’s seats appear decent quality and are highly adjustable but for me the seats are most comfortable when the lumbar support is not engaged. I guess this defeats the purpose, but almost every time I’ve driven the GT-Line my experience remains the same.\nSeat heating and ventilation are nice features, and it sets a luxurious tone to the car and does feel special over the SX+, which only offers heated seating.\nThere is a combination of suede and leather upholstery in the GT-Line which, if I’m being honest, I didn’t even notice at first – I don’t think it makes a major difference to the car and perhaps this was Kia trying to separate this model from the SX+. To me at least, it fell on deaf ears – or blind eyes in this case.\nThere are dual 12.3-inch infotainment and instrument cluster displays which are housed in a curved casing. It does feel more luxurious than what I would expect from a Kia, so points for that. Remembering the car is less than $60,000 before on-road costs, this type of instrument setup is something I’d expect to see in a BMW or Mercedes-Benz.\nUnder the air vents and woodgrain insert is a touchscreen to control climate and infotainment settings like media and navigation. Amongst the controls there is a small button that will select whether climate or infotainment settings are displayed, but to me it was a little too small and fiddly in operation.\nI found while driving I often accidentally pressed the wrong button because the correct choice was nestled in between a variety of other virtual buttons. It’s not ideal to take your eyes off the road for any amount of time, let alone constantly moving them across rows of infotainment controls – at times I found operating these controls a little unnerving.\nTwo dials are located on either side of the button display, and these controls can change multiple settings, depending on which main controls are selected i.e. temperature or volume controls.\nI should mention that I am fairly small, so I had to lean forward from my driving position to reach the infotainment system each time I wanted to make an adjustment. While I got used to this after a while, I haven’t have this issue with competitors and it was a little annoying.\nThe centre console area features a wireless phone charger, two USB ports (including a USB-A and USB-C) as well as a 12V socket. I did find it redundant to have a wireless phone charger but wired phone mirroring, which meant my iPhone wouldn’t comfortably fit in the space and would shift around as I was driving.\nThe centre tunnel doesn’t feel crowded with buttons and offers the driver a good number of controls and settings to choose from.\nI found the cup holders a little annoying, too. Kia offers a retractable semi-circle that forms the cup holder – which will stow away when they aren’t needed – so you can store other things like keys or a small wallet. Beware however, the compartment isn’t rubber-lined and can mean harder items can rattle about.\nThe back seats are some of the most spacious within the segment in regards to leg room. I was also able to fit three child seats across the second row; however I would suggest if you have young ones, use compact car seats especially when choosing baby capsules.\nSpeaking of kids, amenities in the second row features two air vents, hooks for small bags, USB-C ports, seatback pockets, and the centre seat reveals an armrest and two cup holders. There is one small drink bottle holder in each door bin and a large hanger on the headrest of the front seats.\nThe panoramic sunroof makes the car feel bigger and more spacious and proves to be quite entertaining for the kids at night, especially star gazing as you’re driving home.\nThe boot is very spacious, I was able to fit a single pram alongside four or five bags of groceries. A full-size spare tyre is kept underneath the boot floor. Quoted volume is 543L-1829L (VDA).\nI found loading things into the boot was easy because the boot height was around hip height. This made it easy to get prams, groceries etc. into the car without strain.\nAlthough Kia could improve on little details like window shades, a heated steering wheel, a head-up display and tri-zone climate control; the cabin as a whole has a lot to offer.\nWhat’s under the bonnet?\nIt’s worth mentioning that while the combined fuel economy was 6.3L, the urban claim was 7.7L/100km. I thought the 7.3L/100km I achieved was fair considering I was doing mostly city driving.\nHow does the Kia Sportage drive?\nThe first thing I realised is the seating position and transmission shifter felt a little awkward, and took quite a bit of adjusting.\nIt’s not uncomfortable but I did find it took some getting used to – and that was before I even turned the car on. Eventually I got things sorted and hit the road.\nThe diesel engine felt smooth to drive once you’re off the line. You rarely have to put your foot all the way down from a traffic light but in the cases where I needed to have a better chance of merging, I found the car lagged off the mark a little more than I would have liked.\nThe Sportage feels solid and confident on highways though, and is just as capable on the school run or weekend sport.\nI found after consistently driving the GT-Line I became very reliant on the Blind Spot View Monitor cameras which project a live side camera feed into the instrument cluster when you indicate. Although it’s a “luxury” gimmick it did make me stop and think how it encourages lazy driving behaviour.\nDrivers shouldn’t be reliant on cameras around the car to simply change lanes or pull out of a car park. Rather than assist, the tech becomes a piece of technology drivers become dependent upon – and that doesn’t sit well with me.\nThe Sportage GT-Line has an auto-hold function. In stop-start traffic it’s an important feature for me and I’m glad Kia has it working smoothly.\nSpeaking of stop-start driving – Kia still doesn’t offer fuel-saving idle start/stop technology on the bulk of its Australian range. It’s a shame, given these cars will likely spend a lot of their time in town.\nThere are a few drive modes available in the Sportage. I found driving in Eco or Normal to be the picks, and found them very responsive.\nSome of the safety features can be a little intrusive and aggressive. I found the lane-keep assist disruptive – sometimes it would aggressively pull you in or out of a lane even when I had my indicator on.\nThe adaptive cruise control was responsive and not at all clunky. It works a lot better than in other SUVs, particularly Chinese-branded rivals.\nThe Sportage thankfully doesn’t have the annoying speed limit alert, which was a big turn-off in Kia’s newer models like the\nSeltos. The 360-degree camera is great when getting out of tight parking spots or making sure there aren’t any kids bikes (or kids for that matter) in the way when you’re reversing out of the driveway.\nWhat do you get?\nSportage S highlights:\n- 17-inch alloy wheels\n- 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system\n- Apple CarPlay, Android Auto (wireless)\n- DAB digital radio\n- 6-speaker audio\n- ‘Basic’ digital instrument cluster\n- 4.2-inch TFT display\n- LED headlights (reflector-type)\n- LED daytime running lights\n- Partial-LED tail lights\n- Full-size spare wheel\n- Leather-accented steering wheel, PVC shifter\n- AEB with pedestrian, cyclist, junction assist\n- Blind-spot assist\n- Rear cross-traffic assist\n- Lane Follow Assist\n- Lane keep assist\n- Intelligent speed limit assist\n- Adaptive cruise control**\n- Electric park brake**\n- Reversing camera\n- Rear parking sensors\n- Tyre pressure monitoring\n- Front-centre airbag\n**not available for manual variants\nSportage SX adds:\n- 18-inch alloy wheels (machine face)\n- 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system\n- Satellite navigation\n- Apple CarPlay/Android Auto (wired)\n- Power driver’s lumbar adjustment\n- Rain-sensing wipers\n- Dual-zone climate control with auto de-fog\n- Auto up/down windows (front)\n- Leather-wrapped shifter\n- Remote-folding second-row seats\n- Gloss black interior trim\n- DAB radio\nSportage SX+ adds:\n- 19-inch alloy wheels (machine face)\n- 8-speaker Harman Karon premium audio\n- Faux leather seat trim\n- Heated front seats\n- LED front fog lights\n- Power driver’s seat with power lumbar\n- Electric tailgate\n- Electrochromic rear-view mirror\n- Keyless entry with push-button start\n- Steering-mounted paddle shifters\n- Rear privacy glass\n- Front parking sensors\n- 2x USB-C chargers in front seat backs\nSportage GT-Line adds:\n- 19-inch alloy wheels\n- 12.3-inch instrument cluster\n- Leather seats with suede upper\n- Driver’s seat with memory function\n- Power passenger seat adjustment\n- Heated/ventilated front seats\n- Dual-LED headlights (projector type)\n- Full-LED tail lights\n- Shift-by-wire gear selector (dial type)\n- Wireless phone charger\n- Ambient interior lighting\n- LED interior lighting\n- Panoramic sunroof\n- Alloy sports pedals\n- Blind Spot View Monitor\n- Parking Collision Avoidance (reverse)\n- Remote Smart Park Assist (diesel only)\n- Surround-view cameras with 3D view\n- Metal scuff plates\nIs the Kia Sportage safe?\nThe Kia Sportage wears a five-star ANCAP safety rating based on tests by Euro NCAP in July 2022.\nIt scored 87 per cent for adult occupant protection, 87 per cent for child occupant protection, 66 per cent for vulnerable road user protection, and 74 per cent for safety assist.\nStandard safety equipment includes:\n- 7 airbags incl. front-centre\n- Adaptive cruise control\n- Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)\n- Blind-spot assist\n- Intelligent speed limit assist\n- Lane Follow Assist (centring)\n- Lane keep assist\n- Rear cross-traffic assist\n- Rear parking sensors\n- Reversing camera\nSportage GT-Line adds:\n- AEB in reverse\n- Blind Spot View Monitor\n- Remote Smart Park Assist (2.0D)\n- Surround-view cameras\nHow much does the Kia Sportage cost to run?\nAll Kia models are backed by a seven-year, unlimited-kilometre warranty with seven years of capped-price servicing.\nThe first seven services for the 2.0L turbo diesel models are $346, $537, $416, $790, $389, $675, and $412.\nCarExpert’s Take on the Kia Sportage\nI think the Sportage is a great car for parents who are slowly growing their family. It’s fun, it’s modern and will give you features traditionally available in expensive luxury European cars.\nIt’s good value for money if you are comparing with the\nNissan X-Trail, Toyota RAV4, Mazda CX-5, and its cousin the Hyundai Tucson; which all ask a couple of thousand dollars more for their respective flagship versions.\nThe Sportage GT-Line has a few features that deduct points for practicality, but with the amount of tech and gear it had for under $60,000 it’s one of the better SUVs in the segment. I don’t know if waiting six months or more for this car is justified however; especially when there was no stop-start technology or hybridisation.\nI would consider test driving other models that may offer a stop-start function to reduce fuel consumption, or perhaps wait for the Sportage Hybrid which is due to arrive in Australia sometime in the early stages of 2024.\nThe GT-Line does at least tick a lot of boxes and should definitely be short-listed. Closely check the features list; though, as perhaps the devil is in the detail.\nBUY:\nhttps://www.carexpert.com.au/buy/kia/sportageMORE: Everything Kia Sportage\nPros\n- Attainable flagship SUV\n- Good start for new families\n- Smooth drive\nCons\n- Missing some features available in rivals\n- Long wait times\n- Safety tech can lead to laziness\nTop Line Specs\n- Power: 137kW\n- Fuel Type: Diesel\n- Economy: 6.3L/100km\n- CO2 Emissions: 163g/km\n- ANCAP Safety Rating: 5",
