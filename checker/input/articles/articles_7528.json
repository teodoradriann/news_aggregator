    "title": "Boost Your Rice’s Cancer Prevention Effect: Adding These Foods When Cooking",
    "text": "2023-12-28 22:30:00\nfood\nIf you add ‘this’ when cooking rice… Increased cancer prevention effect\nReporter Lee Hae-na | Intern reporter Lee Ara\nEntered 2023/12/29 07:30\nIf you use green tea water instead of bottled water when cooking rice, you can increase the polyphenol content, an antioxidant./Photo = Clip Art Korea\nAlthough rice is eaten every day, its health effects can vary depending on how it is prepared. Let’s look at four foods that help prevent cancer when added when cooking rice.\n◇Green tea\nIf you use green tea water instead of bottled water when cooking rice, it becomes rich in antioxidants. According to a paper published in the Korean Journal of Food and Nutrition, when 200g of white rice was cooked with green tea water (3g of green tea powder dissolved in the water used for rice cooking), the polyphenol content, an antioxidant, was 40 times higher. lost. Polyphenols have excellent anti-cancer effects by reducing free radicals in the body and preventing damage to DNA and proteins caused by free radicals.\n◇Soju\nAdding soju to brown rice can also increase the polyphenol content. A research team from the National Institute of Crop Science under the Rural Development Administration added 30% brown rice to 100g of white rice and then cooked rice by adding 120mL of bottled water or 100mL of bottled water and 2 glasses of soju. As a result, rice cooked with two glasses of soju had a 17% higher polyphenol content than rice cooked with just water. This is because alcohol helps to release more of the polyphenol content in brown rice. All alcohol evaporates during the boiling process, so it does not affect the taste of the rice.\n◇Soybeans\nWhen cooking rice, it is good to add a handful of beans (30g) or the water in which the beans were soaked. The isoflavone content in soybeans prevents the growth of cancer cells and inhibits cancer metastasis. In addition, saponin, a white foam component that forms when soybeans are soaked, is effective in preventing cancer by acting as an antioxidant and preventing cell membrane rupture. A research team at Tufts University in the U.S. followed 6,000 breast cancer patients for 9 years and found that women who consumed a lot of beans had a 21% lower risk of death than women who did not consume soybeans.\n◇Burdock\nSaponin in burdock is also effective in preventing cancer by expelling carcinogens from the body out of the body. There is a study by the National Cancer Center in Japan that found that burdock suppressed the growth of pancreatic cancer by lowering the number of cancer cells. Additionally, the zinc in burdock also helps with antioxidant properties, eliminating free radicals and controlling oxidative stress in the body. Burdock is rich in dietary fiber and has a long digestion period, so it is best to slice it as thinly as possible and add it to rice.\n1703804393\n#add #cooking #rice #Increased #cancer #prevention #effect",

    "title": "Viofo A229 Pro review: The dashcam that made me want a dashcam",
    "text": "Are you a good driver? Ask anyone that question, and the answer is usually yes. I was asked this question earlier this year, and my answer was unequivocally affirmative; I’m a great driver, and no, I don’t need a dash cam. Having tried the Viofo A229 Pro, I realized that this is incorrect; there are a lot of hazards out there, and having a dash cam can provide a lot of relief.\nUltimately, the Viofo A229 Pro dash cam made me a convert. It’s the world’s first dash cam with 4K recording at the front and 2K at the rear, and the wide-angle view means most things are recorded. It’s excellent, and after fixing a couple of step snafus (which proved crucial), it convinced me that every car needs a dash cam.\nViofo A229 Pro\nThe Viofo A229 Pro dash cam offers the world's first 4K/2K combination recording. Its high price tag is justified considering its excellent features. And an optional cockpit view camera, polarizing lens, Bluetooth shutter button, and microSD card are ideal accessories that enhance its overall appeal. The camera is adjustable, ensuring you can find the perfect angle for your car's windshield.\n- Everything you need from a dash cam\n- Features two Sony Starvis 2 sensors\n- Excellent overall video quality\n- Great voice control and advanced features\n- Set up is quite intensive\n- Lots of wiring for an integrated experience\n- Pricey with all the add-ons\nPrice, availability, and specs\nThe Viofo A229 Pro is available for $360, which includes the front camera, rear camera, internal camera, and the Anti-Glass circular polarizing lens. The box also offers spare 3M mount sticky pads to attach the cameras to your windshield or rear window, stickers to remove static, and a car charger.\nAn alternative bundle is available for $30 more with an additional internal camera. If you want to hardwire the dash cam, you'll need the optional wiring kit that costs an additional $18. The most economical bundle — and the one that reflects everything that Viofo sent to us — costs $410 and includes all the cameras, the remote shutter, the hardwire kit, and a 512GB microSD card.\nWhat's good about the Viofo A229 Pro?\nA very smart dash cam with all the gadgets and gizmos\nYou’ll love the Viofo A229 Pro if you love technology and want the complete package. If you buy it with the full bundle, you’ll get two outward-facing cameras and an additional one to record your car's interior, an ND filter for the front camera to prevent lens flare, a Bluetooth shutter remote, and a handy microSD card. There’s a lot of wiring included, and while you can choose not to hard-wire it (like I did), the more permanent solution involves passing wiring through the frame of your car.\nThe main 4K dash cam features an 8MP Sony Starvis 2, 1/1.8-inch IMX678 sensor that can capture 4K videos at 30fps with a 140-degree field of vision. Placed next to your rearview mirror, it is ideal for capturing everything happening ahead of you. The rear camera is a 5MP 1/2.8-inch IMX675 that uses the same sensor technology but drops the video recording resolution to 2K with a 160-degree field of view. The latter's specs also apply to the interior camera; both are great as they capture exactly the amount of detail you need.\nI was pleasantly surprised by the cameras' quality. They all feature a higher dynamic range than other dash cams I’ve tried, although my overall experience with them has been fairly limited. Regardless, the image quality was exceptional, even at night, thanks to DOL-HDR technology, which boosts the quality of captures at night.\nThe Viofo A229 Pro dash cam uses G-sensor functionality to detect movement in your vehicle and capture anything pertinent. Suppose you have an incident that it detects. In that case, it will record a 45-second video prior and a 30-second video afterward and then store them in a special folder so they’re not overwritten during the standard loop recording. The GPS logger also captures important information, such as location, speed, and time, and stores it with this, so you always have the necessary information.\nYou can manually ask the dash cam to record or capture a moment using a Bluetooth shutter or voice control. The latter is particularly useful if you aim for a fully hands-free experience but still want to save a particular scene. I can imagine that this would be super useful if someone is interacting with you, and it would be ideal to record the entire interaction when paired with the internal camera. This would also be useful during more official interactions like traffic stops and provides reassurance that you’ll always have your own copy of the events in question.\nThe Viofo A229 Pro has two connection options: a simple solution powered by the cigarette lighter or a hardwired solution if you want something more permanent. I avoided the latter because I wasn’t sure I’d like this dash cam or even want one in my car, but now I’m a convert. I’ll be hardwiring this soon.\nThe additional benefit of doing so is the Intelligent Parking mode, which works like Tesla’s Sentry Mode and helps monitor your car when you’re not in it. This mode kicks in as soon as the ignition is turned off and will automatically capture video if someone damages your car while it’s empty. It’s the ideal way to ensure you always keep tabs on your vehicle. I live in an area with particularly high auto theft rates, and this feature will provide additional reassurance once it's hardwired.\nWhat's bad about the Viofo A229 Pro?\nIt’s simple to install but not that easy\nMy biggest complaint with the Viofo A229 Pro is that while the installation is simple enough, it has some hiccups. I consider myself handy, but the prospect of hardwiring my car proved fairly daunting. This meant that I hadn’t taken advantage of all the features, although I plan to now that I know I will use it.\nAs part of the setup process, you must find the right position on your windshield, especially if you don’t want to hardwire the front camera. The power cable is at the top of the dash cam (although the other USB-C ports work just as effectively), so finding a position where it captures everything and the cables don’t affect your sight line can take some trial and error.\nAlthough the manual directly says to adjust the camera, my brain skipped that step, so I drove around for a few days without capturing anything of value. It took less than 15 seconds to address this, but it’s worth keeping this in mind.\nAnd it still remains to be seen how it compares to alternatives like the Rove R2-4K Pro or 70 mai A510.\n[Read our review ](/rove-r2-4k-pro-review/)\n[ Review: The Rove R2-4K Pro dash cam hits the sweet spot between specs and price ](/rove-r2-4k-pro-review/)\nGreat specs with reasonable compromises\nShould you buy it?\nThe best dash cam you can buy, but it'll cost you\nMy biggest concern is not with the Viofo A229 Pro but rather with dash cams as a whole. They provide a lot of reassurance that they’ll provide evidence when something goes wrong, but equally, they can be used to prove negligence.\nThat said, just having the Viofo A229 Pro in my car made me conscious of the many road hazards. Knowing that footage of my less-than-perfect driving habits could be used to my detriment also encouraged me to be a safer, more considerate driver. Had you asked me before, I would have said I have no worries about having a dash cam in the car, but now the answer is more muddled because the footage could impact the outcome of incidents, positive or negative. That said, having video footage offers peace of mind; the road can be an unpredictable and hazardous place.\nViofo A229 Pro\nThe Viofo A229 Pro has all the features I need from a dash cam and, while I still have existential concerns about having a dash cam in my car, there's no denying just how beneficial this one is. I was a skeptic, but as it turns out, I'm now a convert.\nNirave is a creator, evangelist, and founder of House of Tech.

    "text": "A 10 km apenas da fronteira com o Líbano, os habitantes da cidade de Nahariya, em Israel, parecem não ter dúvidas. Dizem que estão fartos de viver com medo e, por isso, só resta o conflito. De lado, fica a opção de um cessar-fogo. “Isto é uma treta, porque se lhes dermos 21 dias, eles voltam a organizar-se, vão conseguir novos mísseis. Não acredito neles”, diz um local. Uma parte dos que aqui viviam já fugiu para outros lados. Fartaram-se da ameaça constante que se vive no norte de Israel, paredes meias com os militantes do Hezbollah. “Há cidades que foram completamente destruídas. As pessoas deixaram as suas comunidades. Não voltam mais, passado tanto tempo. Lembram-se do passado. As pessoas voltam. Já se mudaram com os filhos e inscreveram-nos noutras escolas”, explica um habitante local. “Não, não acho bem. Penso que temos de acabar com este problema com o Hezbollah e também com Gaza. Temos de acabar com isto. Não com as pessoas de lá, mas com o Governo, com os homens que… Temos de pôr fim a isto. Temos de os matar, de os travar, seja o que for, mas acabar com a guerra, não\", diz um local. Alguns parecem estar fartos de tudo: de não terem paz, da guerra que Netanyahu insiste em manter, de não terem outras opções a não ser o próprio conflito. “A minha opinião é que não confio muito no Governo em relação a isto, porque já houve tantos inocentes que perderam a vida, tantas pessoas que perderam o emprego, a casa, a vida”, explica um local. “As pessoas estão muito, muito tristes com a situação. Não queremos um cessar-fogo, queremos sim pôr fim a esta situação para sempre. Não por um ou dois anos. Só isso\", acrescenta outro local. Junto à fronteira com o Líbano, os israelitas querem a paz mas admitem que primeiro tem de haver guerra.",

    "text": "Wanindu Hasaranga’s lower-order demolition eased Sri Lanka to a 2-1 series win against Zimbabwe on Thursday after the tourists were bowled out in Colombo for 82, their worst-ever T20 total.\nThe home skipper’s 4-15 included two scalps on his final two deliveries and Sri Lanka cruised to a nine-wicket victory inside 11 overs.\n“Today we bounced back,” all-rounder and ex-skipper Angelo Mathews told reporters after the win.\n“We have a very attacking captain who wants to achieve bigger things. He has created a good environment. That is the key.”\nPathum Nissanaka (39 not out) and Kusal Mendis (33) added 64 runs in 46 balls before a deceptive turner from left-arm spinner Sean Williams took the latter off-stump for Zimbabwe’s sole breakthrough.\nNissanka sealed Sri Lanka’s win by launching Sikandar Raza for six over long-on when the scores drew level.\nZimbabwe had a creditable start with 56-3 after the first six overs of power play but struggled to score boundaries once fielding restrictions eased.\nNumber three batsman Brian Bennett top-scored with 29 off just 12 balls, including four boundaries in the second over, before a Hasaranga catch off Mathews sent him back.\nBut a quick collapse saw the tourists lose their last six wickets for just 11 runs including three in the final three balls of the innings.\nSri Lanka’s fielding stepped up after a shambolic show in the second match handed them a four-wicket defeat and Zimbabwe their first T20 win in the island nation.\n“We didn’t turn up today,” Zimbabwe captain Raza said after the disappointing finish to the series.\n“When we needed courage and fighting spirit it wasn’t there,” he added. “There has been lot of good and bad in this series. We have been either really good or really poor.”\nHasaranga’s 4-15 was backed up with a return to form by ex-skipper Mathews, who shared the new ball and finished with two wickets.\nMathews had conceded 24 runs in the final over of the second match to gift Zimbabwe their come-from-behind win.\nOn Thursday marked the first T20 series win for Sri Lanka after a drought stretching back to their Asia Cup win in 2022.\nThey next host Afghanistan for a one-off Test and six white-ball matches.\nBRIEF SCORES\nZimbabwe 82 all out in 14.1 overs (B.

    "text": "L’extrême droite gagne du terrain en Europe. Ces partis émergent désormais comme la deuxième force politique dans environ un tiers des pays européens, dont plusieurs ont réussi à accéder au pouvoir, particulièrement en 2023.\nLa montée de l’extrême droite en Europe constitue une tendance alarmante, alimentée par un soutien croissant à ses partis dans divers pays du continent. Ces formations politiques adoptent des idées populistes extrémistes, comme en témoignent les résultats électoraux en Italie, aux Pays-Bas, en Hongrie et ailleurs.\nAux Pays-Bas, le Parti de la liberté (PVV), figure de proue de l’extrême droite néerlandaise, de Geert Wilders a connu un succès sans précédent. Lors des élections législatives du mercredi 22 novembre, le parti a remporté 37 sièges sur les 150 de la chambre basse du Parlement, réalisant ainsi un score qui a doublé par rapport à 2021. Son arrivée en tête met fin à 13 ans de régime de centre-droit sous le leadership du premier ministre Mark Rutte.\nLe Parti de la Liberté se caractérise par ses positions ouvertement anti-immigration, son opposition à l’islamisation et son plaidoyer en faveur d’une sortie de l’Union européenne.\nEn Italie, le parti Fratelli d’Italia, dirigé par Giorgia Meloni, détient le pouvoir depuis septembre 2022, accentuant la préoccupation face à cette montée en puissance. Avec plus de 26% des voix, Meloni, a ramené au pouvoir une coalition des droites qui rassemblait plus de 44% des suffrages. Selon les observateurs, il s’agit du gouvernement le plus à droite depuis Mussolini.\nEn octobre 2023, l’opposition centriste pro-européenne a remporté la majorité parlementaire en Pologne. Les trois formations d’opposition, la Coalition civique (KO), les chrétiens-démocrates de la Troisième voie et la Gauche, ont remporté ensemble 248 sièges dans le parlement de 460 députés, contre 212 sièges pour le parti Droit et Justice (PiS) et la Confédération (extrême droite) réunis. Cela a désormais marqué la fin de huit ans du PiS de Jaroslaw Kaczynski.\nDans des pays comme la Finlande, la Lettonie et la Slovaquie, des partis d’extrême droite participent activement à des coalitions gouvernementales, consolidant ainsi leur influence politique. En octobre dernier, la Slovaquie s’est ajoutée à la liste des pays européens où un parti d’extrême droite fait partie du gouvernement, en l’occurrence le Parti national slovaque (SNS), membre de la coalition dirigée par Robert Fico.\nBien que l’extrême droite ne soit pas au pouvoir en Finlande, elle occupe une place significative dans le gouvernement. Le Premier ministre actuel gouverne en coalition avec le Parti des Finlandais, qui a obtenu la deuxième place avec 20,1 % des voix, ainsi que le Parti populaire suédois de Finlande (4,3 %) et les Chrétiens-démocrates (4,2 %). Cette dynamique est également observable dans des gouvernements ultraconservateurs comme celui de la Hongrie.\nEn Espagne, le Premier ministre, Pedro Sánchez a réussi à former un gouvernement de coalition de la gauche minoritaire à la suite des élections générales anticipées de juillet dernier. Toutefois, cette réussite ne masque pas l’éventuelle montée en puissance de l’extrême droite en Espagne, avec des partis tels que Vox, qui développe de nouvelles stratégies pour atteindre leurs objectifs.\nLa propagation de ces idées et la participation active de ces partis aux gouvernements soulèvent ainsi des inquiétudes quant à l’avenir politique de l’Europe.",

    "title": "Polémico exjugador de Millonarios volvería al equipo de Gamero: “Claro que sí” - Infobae",
    "text": "Millonarios consideraría a un jugador que pasó por el equipo y terminó en malos términos con los aficionados - crédito Colprensa Millonarios viene de una dura derrota ante Atlético Nacional por 2-1 por la Liga BetPlay, siendo el primer golpe fuerte en el equipo de Alberto Gamero para el segundo semestre, cuando se reforzó con nueve jugadores para pelear por el título y suma cuatro puntos en tres duelos.\nEn medio del dolor por la caída en El Campín, se presentó una polémica porque un exjugador quiere volver a la institución, está abierto a negociar y el técnico Alberto Gamero lo conoce porque lo dirigió en 2020 , pero que los hinchas no lo tienen en sus mejores afectos.\nAhora puede seguirnos en nuestro WhatsApp Channel y en Facebook .\nEl futbolista, que ya ha sido campeón del fútbol colombiano, tiene buen mercado en el país y caería bien en algún cuadro histórico, aunque aceptó que por el momento está descansando, preparándose físicamente y luego considerará opciones en el periodo de transferencias que cierra el 2 de agosto.\n“Si es lo que Dios pone, claro que si” Desde que Alberto Gamero tomó las riendas de Millonarios, en diciembre de 2019, cuando acabó la temporada de ese año, pasaron cientos de futbolistas en su equipo y muchos de ellos se potenciaron con el paso de los años, sobre todo provenientes de las divisiones inferiores.\nUn jugador que tuvo una buena época en el cuadro azul es Jhon Duque, volante que aseguró que estaría dispuesto a regresar al cuadro Embajador , pese a su pasado en Atlético Nacional que provocó el rechazo de los hinchas en redes sociales y en los enfrentamientos.\nJhon Duque fue figura de Millonarios entre 2017 y 2020, con técnicos como Miguel Ángel Russo, Jorge Luis Pinto y Alberto Gamero - crédito Jaime Saldarriaga/REUTERS “ Si es lo que Dios pone, claro que sí. Creo que eso hace parte del profesionalismo de uno , cuando llegué a Nacional lo veía como una situación difícil, pero me siento orgulloso, los retos nunca nos deben dar miedo”, dijo el mediocampista al programa El Vbar Caracol .\nJhon Duque vistió la camiseta azul entre 2017 y 2020, disputó 137 partidos, marcó dos goles y cuatro asistencias, salió campeón del torneo Finalización 2017 y la Superliga 2018, y en su momento era parte de los referentes de la institución por su entrega en la cancha.\nJhon Duque afirmó en 2023 que jugar ante Millonarios, luego de firmar con Atlético Nacional, fue un momento mentalmente duro para él - crédito Colprensa Desde enero de 2022 hasta el pasado 23 de julio de 2024, el Ingeniero fue fichado por Atlético Nacional, que lo compró al San Luis de México, apareció en 79 compromisos, anotó dos tantos y fue campeón del Apertura 2022, Superliga y Copa Colombia 2023.\n“Jugar en Bogotá sería muy buena opción” Aunque Jhon Duque está abierto a un regreso a Millonarios, conjunto en el que se dio a conocer como figura tras debutar con Fortaleza, el futbolista mirará otras ofertas en el mercado de fichajes, una de esas sería en Santa Fe, con el que lo vincularon en los últimos días.\nJhon Duque tiene experiencia internacional con el Atlético de San Luis, en México, donde jugó una temporada en 2021 - crédito Atlético de San Luis “ Todavía no he contemplado nada todavía, fue algo que me cogió fuera de base porque uno ya empieza a hacer ciertos planes , estaba muy acomodado, ahora debemos esperar y mirar que se viene en el camino. Yo había hablado con el técnico hace un tiempo, me dijo que no me iba a tener muy en cuenta y le dije que me podía decir antes cuando se supo de los otros compañeros. La idea era quedarme, pero llegamos a un acuerdo y finalizamos el contrato”, explicó el volante.\nPara el Ingeniero, la idea es regresar a la capital colombiana para seguir su carrera en el fútbol colombiano, tanto por tema deportivo como personal: “Jugar en Bogotá sería muy buena opción porque tendría cerca a mi familia, Medellín me encanta, estaba muy acomodado, tenía mi hogar y mi hijo era muy feliz allá, ahora estamos abiertos de mirar posibilidades”.",
