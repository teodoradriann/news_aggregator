    "title": "Kaun Banega Crorepati 15: Amitabh Bachchan talks about Helen’s escape from Burma to India during Second World War in 1943",
    "text": "Megastar Amitabh Bachchan shared an anecdote about the veteran actress Helen, and talked about how she had escaped from the Japanese occupation of Burma in 1943, during the World War 2, and came to India. Helen is a well known dancer and is known for her character roles. Born in Rangoon, Burma (now known as Myanmar), Helens family trekked to Dibrugarh, Assam in 1943 in order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma. Later on, Helen got her major break at the age of 19 in 1958, when she performed on the song Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu in the movie ‘Howrah Bridge. With legendary actor Shammi Kapoor, she did many hit dance numbers like Suku Suku in Junglee, Yamma Yamma in China Town, and O Haseena Zulfonwali in Teesri Manzil. Amitabh, who is currently hosting the quiz based reality show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati 15 welcomed the roll over contestant Lalit Kumar to the hot seat. For Rs 25 lakh, he was asked: Which of these actresses was born in Myanmar and later escaped with her family to India during the Second World War? The options given were -- Sulochana, Suraiya, Nadira, and Helen. The correct answer was Helen. However, Lalit was not sure about the answer, hence he decided to quit the show, and took the price money of Rs 12,50,000. Amitabh then went on to say, Helen and her family escaped Myanmar...called Burma back then. In order to escape and come to India, they had to trek alternately through miles of wilderness passing through rivers, mountains and forests. In order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma, she had to do this in 1943. She became a popular actress in our film industry. Watching her dance would leave one enthralled, shared the ‘Brahmastra actor. Helen has shared screen with Big B in the movies like ‘Mohabbatein, ‘Don, ‘Sholay, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony, ‘The Great Gambler and ‘Ram Balram. In the movie ‘Sholay, she had a special appearance in the track ‘Mehbooba Mehbooba. Talking about the same, Amitabh added: I had the good fortune of working with her in a few films. Shes a kind and compassionate woman. She used to look after everyone. We pray she stays in good health. Shes old now.",

    "text": "[](https://ambcrypto.com/chainlink-is-another-rally-in-the-works-for-link/) [Altcoin](https://ambcrypto.com/category/altcoins-news/) LINK and MKR stir investor interest: Here’s why - LINK was up by 12% in the last 24 hours, but a few market indicators were bearish. - MKR’s market indicators looked bullish, as they suggested a price rise. As we enter the concluding days of 2023, several tokens, such as [Chainlink [LINK]](https://ambcrypto.com/search/link) and [Maker [MKR],](https://ambcrypto.com/search/maker) are witnessing newfound interest, as several new wallets started to accumulate those tokens. Whenever accumulation rises, it increases the possibility of a price uptick. Therefore, considering the latest interest from investors, are LINK and MKR on the brink of a new rally? Buying pressure on Chainlink and Maker rises On the 27th of December, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet, which highlighted that fresh wallets have started to accumulate LINK and MKR. Notably, whale wallet 0xE68E withdrew 3,150 MKR worth more than $4.5 million, while another wallet withdrew 136,146 MKR worth over $2 million. Fresh whale wallets are accumulating [$MKR]and [$LINK]today. 0xE68E withdrew 3,150 [$MKR]($4.55M) from [#Binance]in the past 20 minutes. [https://t.co/LRuLN0j4Ia] 0x8eAD withdrew 136,146 [$LINK]($2.05M) from [#Binance]10 minutes ago and has withdrawn 384,006 [$LINK]($5.79M) from [#Binance]… [pic.twitter.com/fjCp1lo0Nx] — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) [December 27, 2023] Therefore, to better understand whether investors at large were buying these tokens, AMBCrypto took a look at Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, [LINK](https://ambcrypto.com/chainlink-is-another-rally-in-the-works-for-link/)’s Supply on Exchanges registered a drop while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased. Surprisingly, despite a hike in buying pressure, Chainlink’s supply held by the top addresses remained flat. A similar trend was visible on Maker’s graph. AMBCrypto’s analysis revealed that MKR’s Supply on Exchanges registered a massive drop on the 27th of December while its Supply outside of Exchanges surged considerably. This meant that investors were actively buying MKR at press time. Additionally, whales’ confidence in the token also increased, which was evident from the rise in its supply held by top addresses. However, the graph registered a decline soon after that. Will the coins have a positive impact? To better understand whether the hike in buying pressure would have any positive impact on both tokens’ price actions, AMBCrypto took a look at their daily charts. Our analysis found that Chainlink’s MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Additionally, its Bollinger Bands also hinted that LINK’s price was entering a comparatively volatile zone, which looked bullish. However, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered downticks, implying that a price drop is on the cards. In the last 24 hours, LINK was up over 12% and, at press time, was [trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) at $17.04. Read [Maker’s [MKR] Price Prediction](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/maker-price-prediction) 2023-24 Like LINK, MKR’s MACD also displayed a clear bullish upper hand in the market, and its Bollinger Bands also looked optimistic. [MKR](https://ambcrypto.com/makerdao-closes-the-year-with-this-milestone/)’s CMF and RSI also went northwards, increasing the chances of a price uptick. According to CoinMarketCap, MKR was up by 2% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,599.01 with a market cap of over $1.4 billion.",
