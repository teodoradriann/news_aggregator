    "text": "Bannon to Jail for Contempt of Congress\nSteve Bannon is headed to jail.\nThe man partially responsible for engineering Donald Trump’s stunning 2016 victory will\nreport to prison on July 1 after a federal judge ordered he serve a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.\n“There’s not a prison or jail built that will ever shut me up. All victory to MAGA, we’re going to win this,”\nremarked Bannon moments after the order came down outside a federal courthouse on Thursday.\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, revoked Bannon’s bail and approved the sentence after a federal appeals court last month rejected Bannon’s attempt to overturn his conviction for defying a subpoena from the January 6th Committee.\nBannon was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress in 2022 after he refused to cooperate with the Democratic-led House of Representatives committee. Bannon now joins another top Trump ally, Peter Navarro, in prison. Navarro is similarly serving a four-month sentence.\nThe Committee had hoped to question Bannon about public comments he made about the 2020 election indicating he was involved in attempts to overturn it. Bannon and Navarro are credited with the “Green Bay Sweep” strategy whereby members of Congress would object to the certification of electoral votes.\nSubscribe Today\nGet daily emails in your inbox\nThe “Sweep” never materialized and Joe Biden was sworn in as president.\nBannon’s attorneys argued that the aptly nicknamed “Honey Badger” should remain a free man as the case works its way through an appeal process, but Nichols dismissed their arguments.\nWith his prison term to last until November, Bannon will now be sidelined during the most contentious part of the 2024 election season.",

    "text": "In recent times, the kitchen staples of tomatoes and onions have emerged as major culprits behind the rising food inflation in India, the Economic Survey showed Friday.While food inflation has been a global concern, India’s food inflation rate has remained steadfast for months now and a thorn on RBI's Monetary Policy. India’s retail inflation surged to a 14-month high of 6.2% in October, with food inflation reaching a 15-month high of 10.9%. However, December saw some respite from high prices as food inflation eased to 8.39 per cent in December from 9.04 per cent in November. Moreover, tomato prices were up 24 per cent at Rs 47 per kg in December, as per a CRISIL report. However, the new year might have brought some relief to India's households as common vegetables and staples such as tomato, potato, onion, rice and pulse have fallen by up to 40% in the first fortnight of 2025 sequentially.But is this relief here to stay?As per the survey, with the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) indicating that vegetables and pulses are driving inflation, the factors fueling these price hikes have been identified as adverse weather and supply chain disruptions.Also Read: Economic Survey offers hope to 'aam aadmi' on inflation pains, subject to terms and conditionsOver the fiscal year 2025 (April-December), the combined weightage of vegetables and pulses in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket was a modest 8.42 per cent, yet their contribution to overall inflation reached a staggering 32.3 per cent, the report, prepared by the Chief Economic Advisor to the Finance Ministry, showed. The exclusion of these items from the inflation metrics reveals that the average food inflation rate dropped significantly to 4.3 per cent and headline inflation would be 3.2 per cent.The report further said that the root of these price surges can be traced back to supply chain disruptions powered by extreme weather events. The India Meteorological Department has reported a marked increase in extreme weather conditions—particularly heatwaves and unseasonal rainfall—over the past few years.Also Read: Economic Survey pitches for policy shift to cut cereal output, boost pulses, edible oils Such conditions have wreaked havoc on the production of vegetables leading to inflated prices at retail outlets.Why just tomatoes and onions?Tomatoes and onions, the quintessential ingredients in Indian kitchens, have seen their prices fluctuate dramatically due to uneven monsoon patterns and supply constraints.The Economic Survey said that these vegetables are particularly vulnerable to weather fluctuations; for instance, production of tomatoes, which has a short crop cycle and limited shelf life of 1-2 weeks, is concentrated in a few states. This concentration leaves the supply chain exposed to disruptions, leading to price spikes during lean production seasons.Similarly, onions, which are mainly harvested during the Rabi season, face inflationary pressures due to lower production levels in recent years. The average shelf life of fresh onions, lasting about 2-3 months under ideal storage conditions, means that any shortfall in production can significantly impact prices in subsequent months.However, production woes are not the sole contributor to the increased burden on the 'aam aadmis'' pockets, as per the survey. Analysis of production and consumption trends over the past three years, as per the report, reveals that domestic household consumption of both tomatoes and onions falls short of production levels. According to Horticultural Statistics at Glance 2021, approximately 15 per cent of the production is allocated for bulk consumption in hotels and events like marriages. Even when considering this as an addition to household consumption, production levels still exceed domestic consumption. Therefore, it turns out that price pressures are not fundamentally due to a shortfall in production but to post-harvest losses, seasonal production, and regional dispersion in production. Also, onion exports averaged more than 6 per cent of domestic production during FY20 to FY24, said the survey report. Moreover, India's reliance on domestic production for these staples limits its ability to import during times of demand-supply imbalances, the survey highlighted. With India and China accounting for nearly half of the global onion production, potential imports from other countries are limited, as the next eight major producers contribute only around 18 per cent of global output. Also, the highly perishable nature of tomatoes restricts import options from neighbouring countries, which are not significant producers of tomatoes. Consequently, India faces challenges in importing these essential commodities, the report read.",

I have no interest in playing for Pakistan again,” Malik stated.“I have already announced retirement from two formats. I have been playing league cricket, and enjoying my time, wherever I get an opportunity to play, I try to avail it.”\nUpon being asked about his retirement from T20 international cricket, the former captain stated that he would hang his boots from all forms of cricket altogether.“I have no interest but as I said in my previous interviews I will announce my retirement from all forms of cricket once and for all,” he said.\nHe also suggested that Pakistan’s white-ball captain, Babar Azam, should step down from captaincy and focus solely on his batting. Shoaib Malik believes that the star batter can perform better without the burden of captaincy on his shoulders.\n“As for his captaincy, my firm stance is that he [Babar Azam] should play only as a player. That’s my opinion. When he plays as a player, he can do wonders for the team. He should stay away from leadership,” he added.\nShoaib Malik has represented Pakistan in 35 Tests, 287 ODIs and 124 T20Is since making his international debut back in 1999. He has scored over 11000 runs across three formats and has taken a total of 218 wickets.In league cricket, he is the second-highest run-scorer with 13360 runs, only behind West Indies legend Chris Gayle, who scored 14562 runs.",

    "title": "‘Free to Pee’: Council members, advocates push bills to open up more public restrooms for New Yorkers | amNewYork",
    "text": "The City Council is not holding it in and wants to ensure that New Yorkers do not have to, either.\nCouncil members and advocates with the “Free to Pee” coalition rallied outside City Hall on Thursday to support two bills that aim to address the longstanding shortage of public restrooms throughout the five boroughs ahead of a public hearing on the legislation.\nOne bill seeks to expand the number of public lavatories in the Big Apple by requiring the city to make 45 bathrooms in some of its municipal buildings accessible to the public during business hours. The other would mandate that the city develop a long-term planning process for building one public bathroom for every 2,000 city residents by 2035.\nCity Council Member Sandy Nurse (D-Brooklyn), the prime sponsor of the bathroom planning bill, said the legislation is desperately needed because there is currently only one public restroom for about every 7,500 New Yorkers and only two in the entire city that are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. She added that New Yorkers should not have to buy something from a private business just to use their bathroom or risk paying a ticket for relieving themselves in public.\n“In a city of millions and millions of people who have a variety of different needs, it makes being in public space, being in public life, very difficult for many people,” Nurse said during the rally. “It shouldn’t matter if you have $5 on you to buy a coffee. It shouldn’t matter that you might not present yourself in a way to a private business that allows them to allow you to use the bathroom. You should be able to access, in public, when you are out and about, a public toilet.”\nA public restroom in Union Square. Photo by Dean Moses With fewer public toilets available, more New Yorkers who just can’t wait any longer are breaking the law to find relief.\nNurse noted that the NYPD issued 9,904 criminal and civil summonses for public urination over the last fiscal year — a dramatic 46% increase from the year prior.\n“We cannot be criminalizing people for a human function that every single person has,” Nurse said.\nThe lack of public restrooms disproportionately impacts vulnerable New Yorkers like homeless people and those with disabilities, the pols and advocates said.\nManhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who has been outspoken on the city’s lack of bathroom access, called the legislation to make restrooms in city buildings open to the public a “quick win that we can score.”\n“We have a great bill now that would just open up public bathrooms that we’ve already built in public buildings, that are in use today but are not designated as open to the public and very few people know they exist,” Levine said.\nThe council’s push for the two bills comes a couple of weeks after it released a report finding that two-thirds of the 102 public restrooms they surveyed either had unsanitary conditions or were locked during operating hours.\nIt also comes on top of other efforts to boost the number of public restrooms accross the city. Those include a council bill that would require the city to finish building 151 new public bathrooms that it pledged to build in 2022 and a plan from Mayor Eric Adams to build 46 new public lavatories and renovate another 36.",

    "text": "The crisis in the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama, the largest body of Islamic clerics in the State, has worsened with senior Mushawara member Bahauddeen Muhammed Nadwi openly challenging the Samastha leadership for its pro-CPI(M) stance.\nFor Mr. Nadwi, like many other leaders of the Samastha, the scholars’ body should toe the line of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a policy that the Samastha did for long.\nMr. Nadwi, who boycotted the Gulf edition launch of the Samastha mouthpiece Suprabhatam in Dubai on May 18 on the ground that the newspaper has had a major shift in its policy, appears to be a voice of the IUML in the Samastha.\nAlthough Mr. Nadwi is the chief editor of the Suprabhatam , his role and influence in the shaping of the newspaper’s policies are insignificant. According to sources in the Samastha, he is likely to be removed from the chief editor’s post soon.\nThe Samastha leadership is waiting for Mr. Nadwi ‘s explanation to a memo that was served on him on Wednesday following some critical remarks that he made against the leadership headed by president Syed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal.\nAccording to Samastha insiders, the leadership that follows the orthodox Islamic religious line abhors Mr. Nadwi and the policies of Darul Huda Islamic University, Chemmad, of which he is the Vice-Chancellor.\nThey consider Mr. Nadwi toeing the same line of Abdul Hakeem Faizy Adrisseri, who was expelled by the Samastha last year for the liberal policies that he adopted at the 80-odd institutions under the Coordination of Islamic Colleges (CIC) that he headed.\n“There’s not much difference between Mr. Nadwi and Mr. Faizy. They are two sides of the same coin. They cannot think of a Samastha without the IUML,” said a hardliner demanding not to reveal his identity.\nBoth Mr. Faizy and Mr. Nadwi have been maintaining a pro-IUML stand and holding the IUML president in higher regard than the Samastha president.\nRead Comments Copy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

Ministerio de Defensa de Rusia / Sputnik Washington autorizó al régimen de Kiev a \"contraatacar\" contra Rusia con armamento estadounidense durante su incursión en la provincia rusa de Kursk, declaró la subsecretaria de prensa del Departamento de Defensa de EE.UU., Sabrina Singh.\n\"Nuestra política permite a Ucrania llevar a cabo contraataques para defenderse de los ataques rusos procedentes de esa región fronteriza, y eso incluye a Kursk y [la región ucraniana] Sumy. Así, pues, [los ucranianos] se están defendiendo de los ataques rusos dentro de esa región\", dijo Singh en una rueda de prensa celebrada este jueves.\nBorrell cree que atacar la profundidad de Rusia con armas occidentales avanzará la paz Al responder a una pregunta sobre lo que Kiev pretende conseguir en Kursk, Singh se refirió a las recientes declaraciones del líder del régimen ucraniano, Vladímir Zelenski, según las cuales uno de los objetivos principales es la creación de una zona de amortiguamiento.\nAl mismo tiempo, la funcionaria precisó que el Pentágono todavía \"tiene algunas preguntas más al respecto\", como, por ejemplo, si los ucranianos tienen la intención de \"mantener el control\" sobre la provincia rusa, ya que \"si van a crear una zona de amortiguamiento, eso implica la creación de múltiples líneas defensivas\". \"No tengo todas esas respuestas ahora mismo, pero es algo que el secretario [de Defensa de EE.UU., Lloyd Austin] va a discutir con el ministro [de Defensa ucraniano Rustem] Umérov de nuevo en los próximos días\", afirmó.\nArmas Conflictos Estados Unidos Rusia Ucrania comentarios You use your browser with disabled JavaScript.

    "text": "La première neige de l'année est tombée sur le Mont Aigoual La première neige de l'année 2024 est tombée sur le Mont Aigoual ! Un petit centimètre qui permet de blanchir le paysage et redonne le sourire aux responsables de la station Alti Aigoual. Pour ce premier jour de l'année 2024, la neige a fait son apparition au sommet du Mont Aigoual (Gard). \"Ca fait plaisir parce que c'est tout blanc, mais ce n'est qu'un petit centimètre confie Denis Boissière, co-propriétaire et porte-parole de la station Alti Aigoual. On n'a jamais été aussi prêt. Toutes les équipes ont travaillé tout l'automne, maintenant, on attend la neige réellement avec impatience. On a du froid qui est annoncé aux alentours des 6/7 janvier, On est prêt à produire un peu de neige artificielle. On l'a réglé à -2,5°\" Des balades avec un musher et des chiens de traineau Malgré ce très faible enneigement, plusieurs activités sont proposées pendant ces vacances scolaires. On peut notamment s'offrir une balade avec des chiens de traîneau. \"C'est en kart, ça se fait en famille, le musher est très sympa. Ca permet de découvrir les paysages de l'Aigoual**.\"** On peut également allier course à pied et tir à la carabine laser, comme dans un biathlon. \"S'il fait bon, ça se fait dehors, sinon, ça se fait à la cafétéria qui est ouverte.\" Denis Boissière reste persuadé que ce sont ces activités de plein air qui permettront à la station de survivre. Son rêve : construire un Bike Parc. \"Ca permettrait, avec les remontées mécaniques de monter avec son VTT en haut de l'Aigoual et de redescendre via des sentiers qu'on aurait créés avec des petits modules en bois, ce qui serait très ludique. Ca a vraiment sa place à l'Aigoual car on a les compétences pour faire quelque chose d'intéressant. Même si ça ne sera pas aussi bien que dans les Alpes, ce n'est pas pour cela qu'on ne peut pas le faire.\" Clin d'œil au Parc national des Cévennes qui pour l'instant refuse cette construction. \"Si les députés et les sénateurs gardois, les élus locaux, les associations, les socio-professionnels du massif, les associations de sport se mettent ensemble, le Parc n'aura pas d'autre choix que de changer d'avis.\" Ma France : quelle école pour demain ? Pédagogie positive, innovations, inclusion, mais aussi drames du harcèlement, sureffectifs ou encore salaire des enseignants… ces sujets qui concernent l’école en France sont au cœur de l’actualité et de l’attention d’une immense majorité de citoyens.
