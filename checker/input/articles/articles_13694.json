    "text": "A man who died after being hit by a car was a 'Good Samaritan' who was helping a stranger, police have said. Father-of-two Christian Marriott was hit after a car ploughed into a crowd of people during a disturbance 27).\nSouth Yorkshire Police named the 46-year-old man tonight (Thursday) who died in the incident in College Close, in the Burngreave area of Sheffield. The force said Mr Marriott, who was known as Chris, was out for a post-Christmas walk with his wife and two young sons, aged eight and six.\nHe spotted a woman lying unconscious in the street just after 2pm on Wednesday, and went to her aid. Officers believe he left his family and stopped to provide first aid to the woman, before a car then collided with them both and a number of others.\nIt is believed the woman had been involved in an altercation and several other people suffered injuries during the incident, including an off-duty midwife who had also stopped to help.\nDetective Chief Inspector Andrew Knowles said: “This is an utterly heartbreaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life. Chris leaves behind a loving family including his devastated wife and two young sons.\n\"We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy.\"\nTwo men arrested in connection with the incident – one on suspicion of murder – remain in custody, the force said. Burngreave residents said the incident happened outside a house at the junction of College Close and College Court – two quiet cul-de-sacs of modern houses near Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital.\nPolice had already been called to a violent disturbance in the street when the car ploughed into those gathered outside. Neighbours said the altercation was related to some kind of dispute between two families.\nMr Knowles said: “Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out inquiries, including going house to house to gather witness statements. There are people in that community who hold information which is vital to our investigation and have not yet given statements.\n“I want to be able to get to the bottom of what happened for Chris and his family. I need those people with information to do the right thing. If you don’t want to talk to us directly, you can use Crimestoppers and remain 100% anonymous.”\nA 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 55-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Both remained in custody on Thursday night. A police spokeswoman said the woman Mr Marriott was helping remains in hospital in a life-threatening condition.\nShe said the off-duty midwife suffered minor injuries, another man received serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening. Four further people – three women and a man – suffered minor injuries.\nTarek Nayli, 49, said he came out of his nearby home to see fighting in the street, a number of injured people and neighbours telling him there were others trapped under a car.\nMr Nayli said: “I heard a lot of sound, a lot of voices, a lot of shouting. When I came out, I found people all gathering around and people fighting. One guy had a lot of blood on his face.”\nMr Nayli said the car involved was already there by the time he became aware of the incident and the police arrived two minutes after he did.\nHe said: “I saw people fighting on that corner before the police came and the car was already there. The whole neighbourhood was out.”\nHe said: “They said there were people underneath the car and when the police came they managed to get them out. When the police came, they flipped the car over and they’ve taken two people out.”\nMr Nayli said one injured man was already sitting beside the car and a woman was also clearly hurt.\nAsked about the fighting he saw, he said: “I didn’t see any weapons but there was a lot of hitting and one guy had a stick.”\nMr Nayli said he only found out later that someone had died.\nHe said: “It was very, very sad and also very upsetting and I couldn’t believe it. All of a sudden you find people dead and a very big crime. This is a disaster.”\nOn Thursday morning, police continued to guard an extensive cordon around the close, which about a mile and a half from the city centre. The cordon was dropped later in the day as forensic officers and detectives continued their inquiries in the small semi-detached property.",

    "text": "Year-end financial returns show New Brunswick Liberals beat Tories in donations New Brunswick Liberal Leader Susan Holt speaks to reporters at the legislative building in Fredericton, on Oct. 17, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ron Ward By The Canadian Press\nPosted Jul 12, 2024 05:00:27 AM.\nLast Updated Jul 12, 2024 05:01:38 AM.\nFREDERICTON — New Brunswick’s Liberals ended 2023 with a bigger war chest than the Progressive Conservatives, with a provincial election months away.\nYear-end reports filed this week by the parties to Elections New Brunswick show that Liberals had a surplus of $319,585 and the Progressive Conservatives a surplus of $254,035.\nFor the 2023 year, the Liberals beat the Tories in fundraising, collecting a total of $539,081 in contributions, with the Progressive Conservatives amassing $423,355.\nGreen Party year-end financial returns were not yet uploaded to the Elections New Brunswick website.\nThe provincial election has to be held by Oct. 21, 2024, but Tory Premier Blaine Higgs has not officially said when he would call voters to the polls.\nTom Bateman, chair of the political science department at St. Thomas University, said while the Liberals are in good shape and have more assets than Higgs’s party, the Progressive Conservatives are not doing that badly either.\n“The Liberals are in a fairly good position going into the campaign …. The Conservatives are not in as bad a position as I thought they would be,” he said in an interview.\n“It sometimes happens you’re not in an election year, the party you support is in government, so you don’t need to support them a lot, because they’re already in the driver’s seat and yet, the Tories have been pretty good at raising money in an off year, even as they’re in government. So that’s why I was surprised.”\nBateman noted the stronger fundraising profile of the Liberals, with the party collecting more money on roughly the same number of contributions as the Tories, “which means that the average Liberal party contributor was giving a bit more money than the average Conservative contributor.”\nThe typical Progressive Conservative supporter, Bateman said, might be “a bit lower income” than the typical Liberal supporter.\nThe Tories had 33 out-of-province contributions, for a total of $13,655, and the Liberals had fewer than 10, totalling $5,300.\nMario Levesque, associate professor at Mount Allison University’s department of politics and international relations, said he was not surprised by the out-of-province contributions for the Progressive Conservatives, especially considering the party “brought in people from out West to help their campaign and also have appealed to westerners — right wing — for help.”\nSteve Outhouse, who managed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith’s election campaign last year, was brought in by Higgs to handle the Tory campaign.\nThe executive director of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick, Doug Williams, said out-of-province funds have no undue influence in New Brunswick politics. The Tories, he said, collected 794 donations in 2023 of $100 or more, adding that 33 of them came from outside the province.\n“New Brunswickers want a government that will make life more affordable and not put the province back in the red, and they are donating to help make that happen,” he said in an email.\n“Our fundraising efforts in 2023 were strong and continue to be strong as we get closer to the election.”\nHannah Fulton Johnston, executive director of the New Brunswick Liberal Association, said they were not looking for out-of-province donations, nor are they actively seeking them.\n“(Liberal Leader Susan Holt) has already committed to banning out-of-province donations if elected,” she said. “The small percentage of donations we do receive from out of province are largely from expat New Brunswickers, family and friends — which is well within the scope of the current provincial political financing laws.”\nFundraising is going “very well,” and the Liberals are seeing support “from all corners of the province,” Johnston said.\n“New Brunswickers are responding positively to our message of needing a change in leadership and government.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 12, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press\nSubmit a Correction Accessibility Feedback",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. TEXAS (Texas Tribune) — The U.S. Department of Justice has threatened to sue to stop a new Texas law that allows state police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the border — unless Gov. Greg Abbott backs off of enforcing the law. The new law, known as Senate Bill 4 , is “unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government’s operations” vis-à-vis immigration and border enforcement, an agency official told Gov. Greg Abbott in a letter first reported Thursday by the Houston Chronicle and later posted on social media by a CBS News reporter . If Texas does not formally refrain from enforcing the law by Jan. 3, the agency will “pursue all appropriate legal remedies to ensure that Texas does not interfere with the functions of the federal government.” A person with knowledge of the letter confirmed that it had been sent. An Abbott spokesperson did not immediately return an email requesting comment. The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. The DOJ’s threat came as welcome news to Democrats. “Asking local police to hunt down Texans who look like immigrants doesn’t make us safer: in fact, it takes police away from investigating real crime,” U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Austin, said in a statement. “The federal government must block this unconstitutional anti-immigrant policy before it takes effect.” The new law makes crossing the Texas-Mexico border between ports of entry a Class B misdemeanor. If a migrant agrees to return to Mexico, a judge can drop the charges. Otherwise, a suspected offender faces a potential six-month jail sentence — with longer sentences for repeat offenders. Abbott signed the law Dec. 18 and it’s slated to take effect March 5. The DOJ said in its letter that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws — an assertion backed up by federal court rulings, including by the U.S. Supreme Court. That argument is at the heart of a lawsuit brought last week by El Paso County and immigrants rights groups to overturn the law and stop it from taking effect. Abbott has said that the federal government is shirking its duties when it comes to immigration enforcement — and has therefore left that job to the state.

    "text": "Fox News ‘Antisemitism Exposed’ Newsletter: Hate soars on campus; tennis legend weighs in on viral video Fox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world. IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER: - American colleges rocked by numerous antisemitic incidents in 2023 - Tennis legend Martina Navratilova rips family in viral antisemitic video - Jewish students struggling with antisemitism at college now have use of walk-in mental health clinic TOP STORY: A number of [antisemitic incidents rocked several college campuses](https://www.foxnews.com/media/2023-year-campus-antisemitism-finally-got-reckoning-college-students-cheer-terrorism) this year in the U.S. following the attack against Israel by Hamas militants. In the wake of the [ Oct. 7 terror attack in southern Israel](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/december-27-israel-hamas-war) which left an estimated 1,200 people dead, several college campuses became hotbeds for pro-Palestinian demonstrations amid an [explosion of protests](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/november-18-israel-hamas-war) on the same issue from different corners of the world. \"PATHETIC\": Tennis legend [Martina Navratilova showed her disgust](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tennis-legend-martina-navratilova-rips-family-viral-antisemitic-video-pathetic)with a video that appeared to show a girl telling a rabbi to \"kill yourself\" if they had a problem with \"free Palestine.\" The confrontation took place in Times Square in New York City. \"Pretty sad. And the mother is laughing. Pathetic,\" Navratilova wrote. The clip received more than 7.3 million views since it was posted on Sunday. \"INNOCENT PEOPLE AT RISK\": A record number of Jewish institutions in the U.S. were [targets of swatting incidents](https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-investigating-record-number-swatting-incidents-jewish-institutions-appear-coordinated) over the weekend, and the FBI believes they were coordinated attacks that originated outside the country. \"Swatting\" involves calling 911 and faking an emergency that draws a response from law enforcement – usually a SWAT team. Per an internal FBI memo, more than 30 of the FBI’s 56 field offices are investigating the string of false reports. \"BACK TOWARDS SANITY\": A retired Vanderbilt University professor and [one of Harvard President Claudine Gay's alleged plagiarism victims](https://www.foxnews.com/us/academic-claudine-gay-plagiarized-calls-harvard-leaders-firing-back-towards-sanity) has called for the immediate firing of the embattled higher education leader to \"steer the university back towards sanity.\" \"Fire Claudine Gay posthaste,\" Dr. Carol Swain posted Thursday on X, as part of a social media post titled \"some free unsolicited advice for Harvard University.\" \"She can be relieved of duties until the terms are negotiated.\" QUOTE OF THE WEEK: \"Antisemitism is no longer confined to extremist circles and has become increasingly mainstreamed, a major driver of which is social media and the online sphere.\" - Anti-Defamation League (ADL) study.

    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — A fishing boat captain who disappeared on his boat in the St. Petersburg area Wednesday night as Hurricane Milton made landfall was found floating in the Gulf of Mexico the next day with nothing but a cooler and a life jacket.\nA Coast Guard Air Station Miami helicopter located and rescued him approximately 30 miles from Longboat Key about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, officials said in a news release, over 12 hours after he was first reported missing.\n“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” said Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, Sector St. Petersburg’s command center chief.\nAccording to the Coast Guard, a little after noon Monday, the boat captain, who was not identified, had first contacted Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg watchstanders to tell them that he and a crew member were stuck about 20 miles off John’s Pass, a fishing village on the coast near St. Petersburg. A Coast Guard Station Sand Key rescue boat and an Air Station Clearwater rescue helicopter arrived and hoisted the captain and a crew member, bringing them back to Air Station Clearwater and leaving their boat adrift in the ocean to be salvaged later.\nBut about 3 a.m. Wednesday, the boat captain decided to return to his boat to make repairs, according to the release. When he didn’t check in by noon, the owner of the boat contacted the same Coast Guard watchstanders. They managed to reach the captain by radio, who told them his boat’s rudder was entangled with a line and had again stopped working while he was making his way back to the port.\nBy that time, the seas had reached 6 to 8 feet, the winds had reached 30 mph, and the weather was “quickly deteriorating as the storm approached,” the release said. The Coast Guard told the captain to put on a life jacket and stay with the boat’s radio beacon, which indicates someone’s position in an emergency. That evening, shortly before 7 p.m., crews lost contact with the captain.\n Hurricane Milton made landfall about 8:30 p.m. that night.\nGrady estimated that the captain “experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler.”\nVideo footage shared by the Coast Guard shows the helicopter arriving the next day and sending a crew member into the turbulent water to rescue the captain as he holds onto the cooler.\nThe captain is now at Tampa General Hospital receiving care.\n_",

    "text": "Palestinos em Gaza comemoram anúncio que Hamas aceitou cessar-fogo; Israel ainda analisa Pausa nos combates ainda está em aberto; Turquia pede que Israel aceite proposta À medida que a notícia que o Hamas aceitou um acordo de cessar-fogo para o conflito na Faixa de Gaza, palestinos começaram a celebrar na cidade de Rafah, no sul do território sitiado, onde mais de 1 milhão de pessoas estão refugiadas. Crianças foram vistas em cima de um caminhão para comemorar a notícia. Entretanto, Israel ainda não aceitou a proposta, deixando a pausa nos combates em aberto. Mesmo assim, palestinos também celebraram a notícia nas ruas de Deir al-Balah, no centro do território, e da Cidade de Gaza, no norte. Hamas aceita proposta; Israel analisa O chefe do gabinete político do Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, ligou para mediadores para informar que o grupo armado [aceitou uma proposta para um acordo de cessar-fogo e libertação de reféns feita pelo Catar e pelo Egito.](https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/internacional/hamas-disse-que-aceitou-proposta-de-cessar-fogo-do-egito/) O governo israelense está revisando a resposta. O gabinete do primeiro-ministro israelense se recusou a comentar. Não está claro se o Hamas concordou com a proposta desenhada na semana passada, ou uma versão revisada dela. Uma fonte diplomática familiarizada com as discussões disse à CNN que, depois de uma reunião em Doha, capital do Catar, entre o diretor da CIA, a agência de inteligência dos EUA, William Burns, e o primeiro-ministro do Catar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, os mediadores convenceram o Hamas a aceitar um acordo de três fases.

    "text": "Guwahati: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday said not a single incident of bomb blast took place during his tenure as the CM of the state. He asserted that Assam has turned into a land of peace and development after Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister.Addressing a public meeting in the state capital Dispur, Sarma said there was a time in Assam during the Congress tenure when people had to celebrate Bohag Bihu amid the sounds of bomb blasts or gunfire. “Bombs exploded even in Ganeshguri in the city during Congress time. But a new environment of peace, harmony, progress and development has been created in the state today after Modi took over as PM. Now, Assamese people celebrate Bihu with the sweet melodious voice of the cuckoo,” he added.He said the bandh (shutdown) culture has ended and the state has become protest and violence-free. “I was in Class V in 1978, I have seen bandhs, bomb blasts, picketing, lathi-charge and use of tear gas for a long time. Now people can feel the change over the years after BJP formed the govt that was formed at the Centre in 2014 and in the state in 2016,” he added.He highlighted the govt’s efforts to establish peace in the state over the years and cited the Bodo peace accord and the pact with Ulfa among others as examples. “Thousands of cadres of different rebel groups have laid down their arms and joined the mainstream during the tenure of PM Modi. That is how peace has been established,” he added.Highlighting the massive infra-push in Guwahati, he said bridges have been constructed and national highways have been expanded in order to ensure seamless movement of traffic in the city. He announced that the newly built Guwahati-North Guwahati bridge over the Brahmaputra river will be opened for the public soon, which will enhance connectivity of Guwahati with lower Assam.He expressed concern over the low voting pattern in the city. Sarma, while appealing to the people of Guwahati to exercise the democratic right, said, “You may vote for NDA or the Opposition. But, come out and cast your vote and encourage others to do so.”He exuded confidence that Bijuli Kalita Medhi will win the election from the seat by a margin of at least 5 lakh.We also published the following articles recentlyHalf of Assams Muslims voted for BJP, says CM Himanta Biswa SarmaAssam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma leads BJP campaign in Assam with 50% Muslim electorate support.
