    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2024 / In the evolving landscape of decentralized internet concepts, the frameworks established by early projects like Hyphanet and Tor are being significantly advanced by sophisticated blockchain-based models such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Arweave. Despite these strides, a major hurdle persists: the extensive physical infrastructure required to rival the robustness and speed of established internet service providers. This challenge has historically dampened the widespread adoption of decentralized models.\nHowever, a revolution in global web utilization and support is closer than it appears. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) are emerging as viable solutions, leveraging existing technologies and infrastructures to overcome the barriers that have previously hindered broader applications.\nToday's Internet and the Rise of DePIN\nCurrently, the internet relies heavily on centralized servers maintained by major technology corporations. While this centralization facilitates certain economies of scale, it also concentrates control, raising issues from data privacy to systemic vulnerabilities. As we move into 2024, DePINs present an alternative architecture. These blockchain-based data management systems offer a contrasting model by enabling crowd-sourced infrastructure. DePIN stands out by providing comparable, if not superior, service through incentivization methods like cryptocurrency compensation.\nA principal challenge for the decentralization of such systems has been the requirement for specific, costly hardware, which can discourage widespread participation and inadvertently benefit large-scale operations, leading to new forms of centralization within purportedly decentralized frameworks.\nDePIN not only consolidates global hardware resources but also accelerates the development of next-generation AI-driven societies. By leveraging decentralized physical infrastructure networks, DePIN enables efficient distribution and utilization of computing resources worldwide. This optimization is pivotal in fostering an environment where artificial intelligence can evolve rapidly and inclusively, laying the groundwork for significant advancements in AI integration into human societal structures.\nAeroNyx's Approach to DePIN\nAeroNyx has positioned itself as a pioneer within this domain by utilizing DePIN to manage and tokenize essential computing resources such as GPUs, CPUs, bandwidth, and storage capacities. Through innovative integration of blockchain technologies like onion routing and data sharding, AeroNyx enhances security and privacy across its network. Onion routing obscures data paths, protecting user identities and decreasing surveillance risks, while data sharding distributes sensitive information across multiple nodes, increasing data integrity and reducing unauthorized access risks.\nAeroNyx further bolsters its strategy by implementing advanced encryption technologies such as ECDSA, SECP256k1, ECDH, zero-knowledge proofs, and AES. These technologies create a robust, next-generation privacy network layer that complies with HTTP protocols, allowing for secure global transactions.\nMoreover, AeroNyx has developed a Re-encryption staking network, enabling any user worldwide with privacy bandwidth needs to establish decentralized nodes using their own managed servers. Participants can stake various tokens to cover usage costs, promoting a flexible and economically viable model for decentralized participation.\nAeroNyx has received strategic partnership support and investment from Waterdrip Capital, DePHY, and JrrCrypto. These partnerships enhance AeroNyx's capabilities and reach, leveraging combined expertise and resources to drive the development and adoption of DePIN technology.\nThe world's largest energy re-staking facility has been established on the Re-encryption staking network, providing global users with access to clean energy. This initiative leverages networks like TON and Solana, allowing users to participate and benefit from renewable energy resources. This strategic expansion not only enhances the network's capabilities but also aligns with global sustainability goals by integrating clean energy solutions into the blockchain infrastructure.\nLooking Forward\nThe promise of DePINs lies in their potential to democratize access to computing resources, reducing the entry barriers that have traditionally favored large entities. With technologies like those developed by AeroNyx, it's possible to envision a future where global digital infrastructure is not only more robust and secure but also more equitable.\nThe infrastructure for such transformative change is already within our grasp. With continued technological refinement and increased adoption, we can soon realize a new era of internet functionality that supports broader, more inclusive participation. This evolution could fundamentally alter how we conceive of and interact with the digital world, making it a reality where anyone, anywhere, can contribute to and benefit from the internet's vast potential.\nConnect to AeroNyx\nWebsite: https://aeronyx.network\nX: https://twitter.com/AeroNyxNetwork\nPR Contact:\nZEX PR WIRE\ninfo@zexprwire.com\nSOURCE: AeroNyx\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",

    "text": "OTTAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says a recent spy watchdog report shows a “number of MPs” have knowingly provided help to foreign governments — behaviour he calls unethical or even illegal.\nSingh said Thursday he is “more alarmed today” after reading an unredacted version of a report on foreign interference by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.\nThe intelligence watchdog, composed of MPs and senators, said in a public report last week that some parliamentarians are “semi-witting or witting” participants in the efforts of foreign states to meddle in Canadian politics.\nNew Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks in the Foyer of the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday, June 12, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Patrick Doyle The blunt findings prompted a flurry of concern that members knowingly involved in interference might still be active in politics.\nSingh told reporters that after seeing the full report, he is “more convinced than ever” of the watchdog’s public conclusions.\n“In short, there are a number of MPs who have knowingly provided help to foreign governments, some to the detriment of Canada and Canadians,” Singh said.\n“There are also politicians at all levels of government who have benefited from foreign interference. Some of this behaviour absolutely appears to be criminal and should be prosecuted.”\nSingh said the report also stated that he had been a target of foreign interference.\nBut the NDP leader did not provide details about the number of MPs implicated in the report, their political affiliations or the nature of the alleged misdeeds.\nSingh said previously that if the full report showed any New Democrat MP knowingly took part in meddling, he would remove them from caucus. He indicated Thursday he would not be taking such action.\nSingh said other party leaders should look at the unredacted report and determine whether any of their caucus members must step away.\nThe Green Party’s Elizabeth May, who has also seen the full version, said this week it does not contain a “list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada.”\nMay said she believes the small number of MPs named in the report did not knowingly set out to betray Canada.\n“I am very comfortable sitting with my colleagues,” she said. “We will disagree on policy on many issues. But I am vastly relieved.”\nMay said one unnamed former MP accused in the report of proactively sharing privileged information with a foreign operative should be fully investigated by authorities.\nBut she was quick to add that the few named people in the unredacted report “may be compromised,” as they were “beneficiaries of foreign governments interfering in nomination contests.”\nNew Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks in the Foyer of the House of Commons about the NSICOP report, on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, on Thursday, June 13, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Patrick Doyle The House of Commons voted overwhelmingly in favour of a Bloc Québécois motion this week to have an ongoing commission of inquiry delve into the intelligence watchdog’s findings about specific MPs.\nBloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet has also signalled a desire to be briefed on the complete watchdog report.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has not taken steps to acquire the security clearance needed to read the full report.\nSingh accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of failing to act on the report’s findings.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . He also condemned Poilievre for refusing to learn more about “very disturbing allegations” of foreign interference in Conservative leadership races.\n“The fact that he doesn’t want to know and has been silent, I believe very firmly disqualifies him as a prospective leader of this country,” Singh said.\nLiberal MP David McGuinty, who chairs the spy watchdog composed of parliamentarians, said Wednesday that national security and intelligence should not be a partisan issue.\nHe said party leaders could come together and “have an adult conversation” about how to deal with the issue within their own parties.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 13, 2024.",
