    "text": "Just ahead of the year's end, an incredibly lucky lottery player in Australia scored a prize of more than one million dollars after trying his luck with a popular game.\nEarlier this week, The Lott, Australia's official lottery provider, announced that its Weekday Windfall draw on Monday saw two winning entries.\nOne of the winning entries belonged to a lottery player from Queensland, while the other one was to a person from New South Wales.\nA [press release](https://mediacentre.thelott.com/media-releases/holiday-joy-penhurst-grandfather-ushers-in-new-year-with-1-million-weekday-windfall-win/) from The Lott confirms that the New South Wales winning ticket is held by a Penshurst grandfather who recently visited the Lottery headquarters to claim his big prize.\nMatching correctly the winning numbers on Monday night's drawing 4485, the fortunate player scored an AU$1,002,459.70 jackpot.\nThe seasoned lottery player purchased their winning entry from The Lott's official website.\nMonday night's Weekday Windfall draw 4485 saw winning numbers 28, 15, 5, 26, 30 and 16, as well as supplementary numbers 14 and 9.\nRecently, the Penshurst grandfather, whose name was not publicly released, spoke to Lottery officials.\nThe man confirmed that he has played the lottery for more than three decades.\nWhile the [fortunate player](https://casino.guru/news/hot-picks/fortunate-lottery-player-in-north-carolina-turns-usd25-into-usd1-million--5852) quickly realized that he had just won AU$1m, he remained calm.\nSpeaking to officials from The Lott, the man said: \"I've got a big family with lots of grandkids and great-grandkids, so I dare say a lot will go to them.\"\nMoreover, the lottery player added: \"I actually used all family members' birthdays on my ticket, so it's a special win.\"\nRecalling his experience with lottery games, the Penshurst grandfather admitted that he remembered previously matching five winning numbers but never all six.\n\"I'm excited but I'm pretty calm. I won't do anything extravagant, just save it a bit and look after the kids,\" the [lottery player](https://casino.guru/news/hot-picks/novice-lottery-player-in-maryland-in-disbelief-after-usd50k-scratch-off-win-6450) added.\nRemembering his mother's words, the man said that she used to tell him that his family wasn't lucky with \"competitions and things.\"\nHowever, considering the recent windfall, the man said that this bad luck changed to good, adding that he hopes to see this luck stick to him.\n\"What a win for Christmas Eve. Thank you to everyone at The Lott,\" the lucky New South Wales resident said in conclusion.\nFor the fiscal year 2025, so far, there are 227 division one winning entries. Out of that total, some 61 entries belong to customers from New South Wales.\nImage credit: Pixabay.com",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "A medical student left a message to her late mom via a voicemail after matching for a residency program of her choice and the emotional moment was captured in a video that was shared online.\nWhen Paighton Noel was accepted into University of Utah as a medical student in 2020, she made a phone call to her mom Jacquie Sorrells to deliver her the news.\n\\\"I am accepted into University of Utah's medical class of 2020,\\\" Paighton told her mom at the time.\nSorrells later can be heard responding with so much joy in her voice, saying, \\\"How many tears did you cry? And I said, 'Just stay positive, just stay positive, it's gonna happen, I know it's gonna happen. I can feel it.'\\\"\n\\\"Oh I wish you would have a little more faith in yourself, because I have a lot in you,\\\" her mom added at the time.\nSorrells died during her daughter's third year of medical school after suffering from a traumatic brain injury, Noel said in an interview with \\\"Good Morning America.\\\"\nFour years after making the phone call about getting into the medical school, Noel decided to share another big news with her mom who is no longer with her.\n\\\"Hey mom, it's me. I am going to be an OB-GYN at UMC Chapel Hill,\\\" she said in the voicemail she left for her mom. \\\"Regardless of where I ended up today, you were going to look out for me and get me to where I needed to go.\\\"\nNoel told \\\"GMA\\\" she made the second phone call because she \\\"needed some time\\\" with her mom after attending the Match Day, which is the day when the National Resident Matching Program releases results to applicants seeking residency and fellowship training positions in the U.S.\n\\\"Match Day is just a very, very emotionally charged day, I think, for anyone and pretty much any circumstance,\\\" she explained. \\\"Match Day has just high stakes, high emotions, you open up that envelope, and you have your future kind of laid out for you… And there's huge excitement and there's anxiety and there's heartbreak at times and shock, just so many emotions that people go through and I just felt like I was missing my person and my person [is] my mom.\\\"\nAs for her advice for anyone who is missing their loved ones at a milestone or Holiday celebration, Noel said, \\\"It is 100% okay to have it feel horrible and incomplete. And it's also 100% okay to feel the joy and celebrate that accomplishment or that holiday, because they would want you to.\\\"\n\\\"And I think trying to find ways to keep them a part of these milestones in these next events in your life has helped me somewhat,\\\" she said, adding that \\\"Everything is bittersweet.\\\"",

    "text": "文 | 市值之家，编辑丨孙超 ，作者丨孙鑫鑫\n“开车看广告，比等红灯还‘准时’？”\n2025年5月27日，郑州深蓝车主李先生的一句吐槽，彻底引爆了智能汽车行业的“广告雷区”。\n深蓝汽车未经车主同意，在车机启动时强制推送5秒全屏广告，内容竟是“感恩回馈”的购车券，结果48万车主集体炸锅，舆情敏感度飙至82.27%，CEO邓承浩被迫连夜道歉。\n5月27日晚，深蓝汽车在其官微上对投放广告行为进行了道歉，“很抱歉给车主朋友们带来不便，未来我们将不断改进服务质量，保证车主的用车体验，不再通过车机通道给用户推送权益提醒。 ”\n随后，深蓝汽车CEO邓承浩转发该微博道歉，“我们内部已经进行了流程的优化确保未来用更好的方式，向大家告知深蓝汽车的福利信息。”\n同时，表示，“周末我走市场，接待了几个老车主，有一半都还不知道有一万元专属购车福利。所以我给团队提出了让更多客户知道这个权益的要求。是我的错误，抱歉，希望得到大家的谅解。”\n深蓝CEO深夜道歉背后\n深蓝的广告设计，堪称“用户痛点精准打击”：全屏弹窗、强制观看5秒、需手动点击“跳过”或挂D挡才能关闭。\n郑州车主王女士的遭遇更具代表性——早高峰期间，广告直接遮挡导航界面，导致她错过高速出口，多绕行15公里。\n北京红飒律师事务所主任律师黄启瑞一针见血：“这违反《中华人民共和国广告法》第四十四条‘弹窗广告需一键关闭’的规定，若因广告遮挡视线引发事故，车企得赔医疗费、误工费。”\n深蓝官方声明称，推送广告是为了提醒首任车主查收S09专属购车券，“因为终端接待中发现很多车主不知晓该权益”。\n但《中华人民共和国消费者权益保护法》第九条明确规定：消费者有权自主选择商品或服务。\n深蓝却通过App隐私协议更新，把“接受广告推送”和“完整使用App功能”强制绑定。不同意？那就只能以游客模式访问部分内容。\n北京理道律师事务所主任律师王久成直言：“这是利用技术优势限制用户选择，涉嫌违法。”\nCEO邓承浩在道歉微博中说：“周末走访市场发现一半车主不知福利，所以我要求团队让更多客户知道权益。”\n当深蓝在“流量陷阱”里越陷越深时，特斯拉的“无广告座舱”策略却成了行业标杆。马斯克曾公开表示：“车机是驾驶工具，不是广告屏。”\n特斯拉的系统中，没有弹窗广告，没有强制推送，所有服务信息都通过用户主动查询或订阅提供。\n这种“克制”，不仅赢得了用户信任，更让特斯拉在2025年Q1实现了22%的毛利率。\n物理断网、防火墙盒子…车主为拒广告拼了\n当深蓝汽车因车机广告被骂上热搜时，无数车主才发现，自己花几十万买的不是车，而是一台“广告智能终端”。\n从2022年一汽-大众ID.6导航界面弹购车积分广告，到奔驰EQE、长城哈弗集体“沦陷”，车机广告早已不是个例。\n中国汽车流通协会数据显示，2024年相关投诉量同比激增210%，成了仅次于电池安全的“维权重灾区”。\n这场乱象的背后，是车企用技术编织的“灰色产业链”，把用户权益当成了“流量提款机”。\n中移物联河南分公司技术人员的揭秘，原来，车企对车机系统的控制权，早已到了“为所欲为”的地步。\n车辆通过内置的T-Box模块与云端实时连接，广告指令能通过OTA通道直接“空降”到车机终端，车主连拒绝的机会都没有。\n车企利用Android系统的底层权限漏洞，把广告进程和核心系统服务绑在一起，想卸载？没门。想禁止自启动？做不到。\n部分车型甚至在通信协议里预设了广告指令位，就算断网，广告也会“补推”。\n面对车企的技术霸权，普通车主只能“躺平”吗？\n车载芯片工程师王先生苦笑：“杜绝广告的唯一办法是物理断网，但远程控车、OTA升级这些功能全得废。”\n极客群体更拼——有人自己加装“防火墙盒子”拦截广告指令，可一旦涉及改装，质保就没了。\n现行法规对车机广告的约束几乎“形同虚设”。\n《互联网弹窗信息推送服务管理规定》虽然要求弹窗广告“一键关闭”，但没提“驾驶场景”的特殊限制；《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》第二十二条强调“安全驾驶”，却没明确车机广告算不算“干扰因素”。车企正是钻了这些空子，才敢明目张胆地试探法律红线。\n深蓝汽车法务部的声明说，App隐私政策调整是“应有关部门要求强化用户隐私保护”，和广告推送“没关系”。\n可隐私协议里明明写着“接受产品推广活动”“车机端消息推送”，不同意就只能用游客模式访问部分功能。\n全国乘用车市场信息联席会秘书长崔东树一针见血：“车机广告的商业模式根本不成熟，车企急着靠广告赚钱，只能牺牲用户权益。”\n从大众到奔驰，从深蓝到哈弗，车机广告的“灰色产业链”正在野蛮生长。210%的投诉激增，48万车主的愤怒，都在敲响一个警钟：智能汽车的时代，技术可以创新，但商业伦理不能“脱轨”。\n车企必须明白，车机屏幕是驾驶工具，不是广告牌；用户权益是底线，不是可以随意践踏的“流量资源”。\n“第三生活空间”的选择权？\n从充电时弹出的购物链接，到导航途中突然蹦出的促销弹窗，车机屏幕正从“驾驶助手”沦为“流量韭菜地”。\n用户安全，不是广告的“牺牲品”。特斯拉的“停车推送”原则，像一记响亮的耳光打在行业脸上：人家车机广告只在车辆停稳后推送，还提供永久关闭选项。\n深蓝汽车倒好，直接在行驶中强制推送，结果社交媒体上“抵制深蓝”“转投竞品”的声浪，比广告点击量高十倍。\n数据显示，2025年中国智能汽车渗透率将突破60%，市场规模达万亿级，可如果每辆车都变成“移动广告屏”，用户敢用吗？\n法律合规，不能总靠“血泪教训”倒逼。\n欧盟GDPR要求车企购车时必须显著告知广告规则并获得书面授权，现行法规对“驾驶场景广告”的法律责任几乎空白，结果就是车企肆无忌惮。\n广告遮挡视线导致事故？大不了道个歉、赔点钱，下次还敢，可用户失去的是对品牌的信任。\n深蓝汽车道歉后，股价跌了、销量降了，这损失比广告收入高多少倍？\n行业急需“刚性约束”：建立“车机广告黑名单”，对违规企业罚款、限售；明确“驾驶场景广告”致事故的，车企承担主要赔偿责任。\n从“流量收割”到“服务增值”。\n蔚来NIO Life商城卖高品质周边，小鹏XPILOT软件服务订阅，这些模式证明：用户愿意为价值买单，但不愿意被当“流量韭菜”。\n用户信任是比广告收入更珍贵的资产，当车企学会用“服务增值”替代“流量收割”，才能在这片万亿蓝海中活下去。\n数据显示，蔚来用户复购率超50%，小鹏软件订阅收入占比逐年上升，而深蓝汽车的广告风波，本质上是行业“伦理觉醒”的催化剂，当车机屏幕从“驾驶工具”变成“广告载体”，企业面临的不仅是法律风险，更是商业伦理的终极考验。\n深蓝汽车的道歉，不该是行业风波的终点，而该是智能汽车商业伦理重构的起点。\n据悉《中华人民共和国广告法》第四十三条第一款规定：“任何单位或者个人未经当事人同意或者请求，不得向其住宅、交通工具等发送广告，也不得以电子信息方式向其发送广告。”\n第四十四条规定：“利用互联网从事广告活动，适用本法的各项规定。利用互联网发布、发送广告，不得影响用户正常使用网络。在互联网页面以弹出等形式发布的广告，应当显著标明关闭标志，确保一键关闭。”\n与此同时，《中华人民共和国消费者权益保护法》第二十九条亦有规定：“经营者未经消费者同意或者请求，或者消费者明确表示拒绝的，不得向其发送商业性信息。”\n可见，法律并不禁止广告经营者通过互联网等方式向消费者推送广告或者其他商业信息，但应当保证消费者的拒绝权（选择权）。\n对此，有业内人士表示，对于不同产品来说，用户对广告的接受度也是不一样的。像电视、手机之类的产品，可能最多就是影响到用户的体验感。\n但对于汽车而言，突然弹出的广告界面不仅严重影响使用体验，更可能分散驾驶员的注意力，构成潜在的安全隐患，应该慎之又慎。\n这场伦理重构战，才刚刚打响。",

    "text": "Home-based midfielder Papa Daniel Mustapha has promised to make the most of his Super Eagles opportunity, expressing determination to prove his worth if given a chance in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Rwanda and Zimbabwe.\nThe 23-year-old Niger Tornadoes star, one of two NPFL players in Coach Eric Chelle’s debut Super Eagles squad, opened up about his unexpected call-up and experience training alongside Nigeria’s established internationals.\n“I never expected it. I was just doing my thing,” Mustapha told the team’s media from their Radisson Blu camp in Kigali.\n“When I saw the provisional list, I was shocked. I was like ‘Oh, okay’. And when I saw the 23-man list, I was very, very happy. Thanks to God, it’s not easy to be here.”\nThe midfielder, who also helped the Super Eagles B team qualify for CHAN after a six-year absence, described the experience as a significant motivation to elevate his game.\n“Seeing the big boys in camp, my first time with the Super Eagles, I’m very, very happy. And seeing them around is a motivation for me to do more, and to show them what I have, and be humble,” he added.\n“They’re all friendly, they encourage everyone. We, the home base, we never felt like we are not among them.”\nLooking ahead to potential playing time, the midfielder expressed confidence in his abilities while acknowledging the importance of seizing any opportunity that comes his way.\n“I know we have everything we need to qualify for the World Cup. We can, and I just pray for the luck. I’ll be very, very happy if I have the chance. And I’ll show Nigeria and the world who I am and what I can do,” Mustapha said.\nThe Niger Tornadoes midfielder also spoke about his approach to learning from his more experienced teammates.\n“I love good footballers. When I see you play, I know I can learn something from you. I admire them, and I pick things I know I need to learn. Just do it for myself,” he concluded.\nNigeria faces Rwanda in Kigali on Friday before hosting Zimbabwe at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo four days later, as they aim to improve their position in Group C of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.A",

    "text": "iniciativa país Madre de las Aguas es declarada Reserva de la Biosfera de la Unesco Este ecosistema especial dominicano incluye tres reservas científicas, dos monumentos naturales y dos reservas forestales, abarcando once provincias y 36 municipios. El Programa sobre el Hombre y la Biosfera (MaB, por sus siglas en inglés) de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura (Unesco) declaró hoy la Reserva de Biosfera Madre de las Aguas, un espacio geográfico de República Dominicana que compromete a prestar una atención especial a áreas de montañas, que incluyen varios parques nacionales y que son fundamentales para la conservación de las fuentes acuíferas. Yvonne Arias, del Comité MaB Dominicano y de Grupo Jaragua, comunicó la información desde la asamblea en Agadir al ministro de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, quien ponderó el trabajo de los equipos técnicos que hicieron posible la aprobación de la propuesta. “Sabemos que la preservación de nuestras montañas, y la ampliación y protección de nuestros bosques son fundamentales para la conservación de nuestras fuentes de agua. De modo que esta declaración nos lleva a un mayor compromiso a todos los dominicanos para preservar nuestros recursos naturales y, al mismo tiempo, a valorar y prestar una mayor atención al campesino de nuestras montañas”, dijo Miguel Cera Hatton. Esta iniciativa ayudará al país a fortalecer la protección de 709 ríos y arroyos, en siete cuencas principales: Yaque del Norte, Yaque del Sur, Yuna, Nizao, Ocoa, Artibonito y Haina. Madre de las Aguas incluye tres reservas científicas, dos monumentos naturales y dos reservas forestales, abarcando once provincias y 36 municipios: Azua, Dajabón, Elías Piña, La Vega, Monseñor Nouel, Peravia, San Cristóbal, San José de Ocoa, San Juan, Santiago y Santiago Rodríguez, para una superficie estimada de 398,247 kilómetros cuadrados, con una incidencia poblacional de más de 1,591,000 personas. Yvonne Arias explicó que República Dominicana completó con éxito todas las tareas que le había encomendado el Programa sobre el Hombre y la Biosfera. La reconocida ambientalista estuvo en la asamblea con miembros de la Delegación Permanente de la República Dominicana ante la Unesco, que encabeza el embajador Andrés L. Mateo. La asamblea está presidida por Marruecos, en la persona de Latifa Yaacoubi. Arias agradeció, en nombre de República Dominicana, a la presidencia del CIC del MAB. “Para República Dominicana, esta declaratoria reafirma el compromiso asumido frente a la protección de la biodiversidad, la seguridad hídrica, a través de la conservación y protección de las áreas protegidas y nuestras cuencas prioritarias”, dijo. Recordó que el proyecto abarca 20 áreas protegidas, las cuales incluyen reservas científicas, parques nacionales, monumentos naturales y reservas forestales. “Esta decisión ayudará al país a fortalecer la protección de 709 ríos y arroyos, en 7 cuencas principales”. Arias felicitó a las 11 provincias y 32 municipios que hicieron suyo este proyecto.",
