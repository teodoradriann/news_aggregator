    "text": "Pearman on the cusp of Gosling’s Moongate Tour glory Dwayne Pearman is set to be declared the 2024 Gosling’s Moongate Tour Order of Merit winner on Friday. A tight two-horse race between series leader Pearman and nearest rival and fellow professional Chris Smith had been poised to go down to the wire in the final medal event at Port Royal Golf Course. However, Smith has been ruled out as he is travelling overseas, leaving Pearman with an unassailable lead heading into today’s 18-hole strokeplay event at the par-71 Southampton course. Very little separated the pair with Pearman clinging to a slim 0.71 point advantage over Smith. “I won’t be playing in the final event as I am in the UK taking my son to school,” Smith told The Royal Gazette. “Good luck to Dwayne and all the other players in the final event.” Also ruled out are Tour co-founder Chaka DeSilva and top amateur Kenny Leseur who are also off island, the latter attending school at Butler University. That leaves Pearman, who already has two wins under his belt this year, having all but secured the title. “It’s cool to be in this position. I missed the last two tournaments so I don’t have any expectations,” he said. “I just want to try and play well playing my favourite course in the world. “I am hitting it OK, I just haven’t been in any tournaments. I have just been knocking it around a little bit.” Today’s medal event features one of the strongest fields assembled this year, which includes professionals Camiko Smith, Nick Jones and last year’s Order of Merit winner Scott Roy, who are expected to be in contention. Jones and Roy have already savoured success this year with one win each under their belt. Also expected to be in the hunt for medal honours are top amateurs Jarryd Dillas, Eric West, Jevon Roberts, Will Haddrell and Oliver Betschart, the 2023 Moongate Tour Championship winner.

Updated: 1:26 PM PST Dec 26, 2024 Ariana Araiza Weather Anchor Sunflower sea stars are a type of starfish, endangered from the open waters, and now they’re being grown in a laboratory in Moss Landing.This happened after a disease called Sea Star Wasting Syndrome (SSWS) killed off most of its population in Western America, back in 2013.“It pretty much just liquifies them right on the spot, and it can take anywhere from a couple of days to not much longer. And that’s problematic because sea stars are a key predator in kelp forest systems,” said April Ridlon, a marine ecologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.In other words, the loss of this predator caused the number of purple sea urchins to explode, allowing them to feast on the kelp forest.At the same time, a marine heat wave known as “the Blob” also impacted the kelp forest, upending the ecosystem even further.“Our studies estimate anywhere between 55 up to a 75% decline of kelp forests, and up north, the estimates are even more grim … up to 95%,” Ridlon said.Vince Christian, the Laboratory Manager at Sunflower Star Laboratory, is an engineer by trade and an avid diver. He noticed the decline of the kelp forest in Monterey Bay during his frequent diving trips. Eager to find a solution, Christian reached out to the community and assembled a team of local scientists to create a nonprofit. “The thing that excites me the most is how this all came together as far as the community; this is a community project, all the work is being done by volunteers. The people saw a problem, and they got together to solve it, and being a part of that is really rewarding,” Christian said.Christian and his team started their work in his garage before funding brought them to Sunflower Star Laboratory in Moss Landing.

    "text": "Scientists were shocked by how warm it was in 2023. The following year was even hotter\nBy March, NOAA estimated a 55% chance that 2024 would be Earth's warmest year.\nHow warm was 2024? By March, just three months into the year, NOAA had already estimated a 55% chance that 2024 would be the warmest year on record for the planet. By July, they gave it a 77% chance.\nIt was nearly certain by November.\nTurns out, breaking the record was never really in doubt. The year easily beat out the previous record holder, 2023, for the warmest year on record globally, according to data collected and analyzed by [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/global-climate-highlights?utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gch24), part of the European Union's climate research program.\nCopernicus says the global temperature for all of 2024 was 1.6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA will release its 2024 global data on Friday morning, which is expected to confirm the record-breaking temperature.\nThe year 2024 was the first complete year that the planet was warmer than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to the pre-industrial average from 1850-1900. If that number sounds familiar, it's because the historic Paris Agreement established a 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.\nGlobal temperature was above the Paris Agreement threshold for 11 of 12 months. We've now had back-to-back record-breaking years for the warmest global temperature and each of the past 10 years has been one of the 10 warmest years on record.\nWhile this is the first calendar year on record to top the 1.5°C warming threshold, it's not the first time the planet has passed that mark, including the 12-month global average temperature between February 2023 and January 2024 and the monthly global average temperature in February 2016.\nExceeding the 1.5℃ threshold over several months or even for a few years isn't considered a failure to meet the Paris Agreement's goal. The agreement looks at the global temperature average over multiple decades before making a final determination.\nHowever, climate experts say short-term threshold breaches like we saw in 2024 are an important warning that record-breaking temperatures are likely to continue in upcoming decades if the world doesn't reduce its emissions.\n\"All of the internationally produced global temperature datasets show that 2024 was the hottest year since records began in 1850. Humanity is in charge of its own destiny but how we respond to the climate challenge should be based on evidence. The future is in our hands - swift and decisive action can still alter the trajectory of our future climate,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a press statement.\nWhat's causing the warming?\nSince last summer, the recent short-term spike in global temperatures has been fueled primarily by the El Niño event in the equatorial eastern Pacific. Record highs for global average temperature tend to occur during El Niño years.\nBut an El Niño alone isn't causing the record breaking warming, [according to climate scientists](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-el-ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93southern-oscillation-enso-nutshell). What happened in 2024 is that a short-term El Niño spike occurred on top of the gradual, long-term global warming trend primarily driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, we've seen global warming accelerate during both El Niño and non-El Niño seasons.\n\"The defining factor in the evolution of many key climate indicators in 2024 has been the increasing global temperature, which is largely associated with the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, a consequence of human activities,\" said Copernicus.\nCopernicus data shows that in 2024, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached the highest annual levels ever recorded.\n\"Our data points clearly to a steady global increase of greenhouse gas emissions and these remain the main agent of climate change,\" added Laurence Rouil, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.\nWhile human-produced greenhouse gas emissions and El Niño were key contributors to the 2024 record, some scientists believe there is something else at play as well.\nOne possibility is that the planet is a victim of its own success in curbing air pollution. In recent decades, regulations, including one in 2020 that drastically cut the amount of sulfur dioxide being released by ships, have significantly reduced the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere.\nAerosols are tiny particles that can reflect sunlight back into space and reduce global temperatures. But their concentrations are now greatly diminished. [According to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-national-summary), U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped 94% since 1980. The burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities is the largest source of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere.\nWhile this means cleaner air, fewer atmospheric aerosols also results in a greater amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface creating a heating effect. Some [research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL109077) suggests that this may have contributed to recent warm Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures.\nSome climate experts believe the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Volcano may be playing a role in our warming trend. This eruption released an unprecedented amount of water vapor into Earth's atmosphere, [according to NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/earth/tonga-eruption-blasted-unprecedented-amount-of-water-into-stratosphere/).\nTypically, volcanic eruptions cool the Earth's surface by emitting sulfur dioxide, which transforms into sunlight-reflecting aerosols. However, the 2022 eruption was different, as it released a substantial amount of water vapor—a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere.\nA [study](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/37/17/JCLI-D-23-0437.1.xml) published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate, found that this event could have a significant impact on surface temperatures around the world, triggering warming of over 1.5°C in some regions, while cooling others by around 1°C. However, other studies investigating the eruption have come to very different conclusions.\nIn July 2024, research published in the [Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmosphere](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JD041296) concluded that most of the volcano's effects dissipated by the end of 2023. Experts say that the atmospheric aerosol data used in the calculations could be behind the contradicting conclusions.\nCopernicus said the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere hit a record high in 2024.\nClimate scientists say one thing is certain. As long as we continue to burn fossil fuels in large amounts, we will continue to see temperatures increasing globally.\nTo make that point, Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M shared on social media an email template he re-uses each year when reporters ask him about the global temperatures.\nHis [auto-reply reads](https://bsky.app/profile/andrewdessler.com/post/3leuaezlfik2t), \"No, this is not surprising - it is exactly in line with predictions. Here is a comment you can use for your story: Every year for the rest of your life will be one of the hottest in the record.\"\nSo certain of the trends, Dessler concludes by saying that this year \"will end up being among the coldest years of this century. Enjoy it while it lasts.\"\nHigh hopes with the Paris Agreement\nIt wasn't supposed to be like this. When the historic Paris Agreement was signed in 2016, then-President Barack Obama [said](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/05/remarks-president-paris-agreement), \"Today, the world meets the moment. And if we follow through on the commitments that this agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet.\"\nBut in large part, the world hasn't met the moment nor followed through on its commitments.\nIn October, the United Nations Environment Programme published a report aptly titled, \"[No more hot air … please](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024)!\" which found the world has made little progress in reversing the use of fossil fuels and faces twice as much warming as agreed to during the Paris Climate Agreement.\nThe [World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/publication-series/wmo-greenhouse-gas-bulletin-no-20) said carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by more than 11% in just two decades, making 2023 a record for the amount of this greenhouse gas currently in our atmosphere.\nAccording to the [Global Carbon Project](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-increase-again-in-2024/), carbon emissions from fossil fuels hit a record high in 2024 as U.S. crude oil production hit a new record in August 2024, according to the [U.S. Energy Information Administratio](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63824#)n.\nSo, it was little surprise when researchers at [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/the-climate-crisis-worsens-the-warming-outlook-stagnates/), an independent project tracking government action on climate change, declared that efforts to curb climate change have \"flatlined\" since 2021.\nAs leaders fail to take decisive action, the consequences of record-break warming take their toll on lives and property.\nBillion-dollar climate consequences\nLast year, 24 weather and climate disasters in the U.S. exceeded $1 billion in damage, according to the [National Center for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/).\nThese extreme weather events, which ranged from severe storms to hurricanes to wildfires, killed at least 418 people and impacted large swaths of the country.\nWhile climate change may not be responsible for these disasters, human-amplified climate change is making naturally occurring weather events more intense and frequent, according to [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/extreme-weather/), [NOAA](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/extreme-weather/), the [United Nations Environment Programme](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/climate-change#:~:text=Each%20increment%20of%20warming%20results,to%20increase%20with%20increased%20warming.), the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) and the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/weather-climate).\nHuman-amplified climate change has led to the [significant warming of the oceans](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/ocean-impacts), which provides the energy hurricanes need to intensify. Hurricanes Beryl and Milton rapidly intensified over unusually warm ocean water, made several hundred times more likely due to human-amplified climate change.\n[A recent study from Climate Central](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ad8d02) found that every Atlantic hurricane in 2024 saw an increased maximum wind speed, ranging from 9 to 28 mph, because human-amplified climate change resulted in elevated ocean temperatures. The researchers said it's unlikely Beryl and Milton would have reached Category 5 status without the impact of climate change.\nWhile the severe impact of hurricanes and wildfires is evident in the images of mass destruction, extreme heat is actually the deadliest weather-related hazard in the United States.\nResearch has discovered that children and adults over 65 are among the most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses and death and the [Journal of the American Medical Association](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2822854) found that heat deaths in the United States have nearly doubled since 1999 and represent a 63% increase in death rates caused by heat between 1999-2023.\nExtreme heat also affects a child's health, [development](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/working-paper/heat-paper/), behavior, and learning ability. A 2020 study found that a 1°F hotter school year is associated with a [1% reduction in learning that year](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180612), based on test scores.\nBecause our oceans absorb the majority of the planet's heat, global sea temperatures reached record highs for the first half of 2024 and remained well above average for the rest of the year. [According to NOAA](https://abcnews.go.com/International/4th-global-coral-reef-bleaching-event-underway-oceans/story?id=109260007), this has fueled the largest ocean coral bleaching event on record impacting nearly 77% of coral reef areas.\nUncontrolled climate change is also putting nearly one-third of the world's species at risk for extinction, according to a [recent analysis](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4461) by University of Connecticut researcher and biologist Mark Urban. He found that 160,000 species are already at risk because of changes in our climate.\nReasons to be hopeful\nABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent Ginger Zee said, \"1.5 degrees is bad, but it's better than 1.6, which is better than 1.7.\"\nShe added, \"Each point one degree of warming creates more severe consequences for us, especially the most vulnerable. There's still time to slow or even stop the warming curve if we stop burning fossil fuels and reduce our consumption.\"\nWhile we haven't reached peak fossil fuel use yet, renewable energy, like wind and solar, is growing exponentially. According to the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28) (IEA), the \"world added 50% more renewable capacity in 2023 than in 2022.\" The IEA forecasts that the next five years will see the fastest growth yet for clean energy.\nAlthough it was less than many countries wanted, world leaders attending the COP29 UN climate conference agreed to increase contributions to developing nations dealing with the effects of climate change to $300 billion annually by 2035, triple the previous goal of $100 billion.\nCompanies across the globe are working on ways to collect and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and keep it from being released during electricity generation and manufacturing. While these carbon capture and storage technologies are in their infancy and have yet to significantly contribute to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, billions of dollars are being spent on these efforts.\nThere are also tens of thousands of green tech companies around the globe working on everything from clean fusion energy to harnessing the power of waves for electricity to making more efficient electric vehicle batteries.",
