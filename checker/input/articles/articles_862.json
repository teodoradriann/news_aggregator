We love the simple ingredients and big flavor.\nI’ve long been crushing on the classic, totally tasty combo of black beans and corn.\nIf I’ve added either to a dish, chances are the other is sure to follow!\nThis perfect pairing is featured in my crazy popular Baked Black Bean and Sweet Potato Flautas as well as in my Mexican Veggie Burgers and Black Bean Quinoa Salad.\nToday’s recipe features black beans and corn in salsa form, alongside fresh ripe tomatoes, onion, scallions, cilantro. A little sea salt here, a little lime juice there, and the result is a tasty topping for tortilla chips, salads, tacos, burrito bowls, and more!\nThough I often treat this black bean and corn salsa like a dip, I’ve recently started serving it up as a side salad for some of our favorite Mexican-inspired dishes. Last week we had it with vegetarian Mexican Pizza Lasagna. It was so amazing both my husband and I went back for seconds!\nThis salsa can be enjoyed right away, but it’s also even more flavorful once it’s had some time to chill overnight in the fridge.\nYou know what that means people — MEAL PREP! It’s an easy make-ahead option to make once and enjoy all week long.\nBlack Bean Salsa\nBlack Bean Salsa\nIngredients\n- 1.5-2 cups\nblack beans(canned or cooked from dried) - 2 cups corn (canned or thawed/steamed from frozen)\n- 2 large tomatoes (2 cups diced)\n- ½ cup diced red onion\n- ¼ cup chopped green onion\n- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro\n- 2 TBSP fresh lime juice plus extra to taste\n- salt and pepper to taste\nInstructions\n- Prep your veggies, draining and rinsing beans/corn as needed.

Mix well.\n- For maximum flavor, cover and chill overnight in the refrigerator. (Helloooo meal prep!) If needed, dip may be enjoyed right away or chilled for however much time available.\n- Season to taste as needed, adding extras of any of your favorites. You can even add some fresh chopped avocado, bell peppers, white onion, or jalapeño to the mix. I love adding spicy jalapeños, extra lime juice, and extra cilantro - delicious!\n- Serve with crunchy tortilla chips as a tasty dip or serve on top of your favorite protein, tacos, salads, burrito bowls, etc... It's fantastic every which way!\nNotes\nNutrition\nFeeling feisty?

    "title": "Kerrie Elizabeth Struhs: Four chilling words mother told a jury as she faces trial over the death of her eight-year-old daughter who was allegedly taken off her diabetes medicine so she could be 'healed by God'",
    "text": "Mother allegedly refused to take girl to hospitalHer daughter lived with diabetesREAD MORE: Mother charged over girl's death\nA mother charged over the death of her eight-year-old daughter was previously convicted of failing to provide her with the necessities of life, telling a jury at that trial she was ‘a daughter of God’.\nThe disturbing comments made by Kerrie Elizabeth Struhs, the mother of Elizabeth Struhs, can be revealed after she and 13 others were ordered to face a judge-alone trial over the girl’s 2022 death.\nElizabeth’s father, Jason Richard Struhs, and the leader of the religious cult known as The Saints, Brendan Luke Stevens, are both charged with her murder.\nKerrie, Elizabeth’s older brother Zachary Alan Struhs and 10 other people – Loretta Mary Stevens, Acacia Naree Stevens, Therese Maria Stevens, Sebastian James Stevens, Andrea Louise Stevens, Camellia Claire Stevens, Alexander Francis Stevens, Lachlan Stuart Schoenfisch, Samantha Emily Schoenfisch and Keita Courtney Martin – are each facing charges of manslaughter.\nThe 14 co-accused, who believe in the healing power of God and allegedly shun medical intervention, are alleged to have withheld the child’s lifesaving diabetic medication for days in January 2022, instead opting to pray for God to heal the girl.\nElizabeth Rose Struhs (pictured) died in 2022 after members of her family allegedly chose not to give the girl life saving diabetic medication\nKerrie Struhs (pictured), the mother of Elizabeth was charged with manslaughter over the death of her daughter\nOn November 27, following numerous pre-trial hearings at Brisbane’s Supreme Court, an order was granted for all 14 people to face a judge-only trial together.\nPrior criminal proceedings involving Kerrie and Jason failing to supply Elizabeth with the necessaries of life can now be revealed, along with the shocking comments she made at her own criminal trial.\n‘I am a daughter of God’\nThree years before her death, Elizabeth Struhs became deathly ill from her undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes.\nShe spent days being incontinent, struggling to stay awake or keep food down at her family’s Rangeville home. She had lost a considerable amount of weight and was being pushed around the house in a chair.\nDespite this, Kerrie refused to take her to the hospital.\nShe insisted to her husband Jason that God would intervene and heal their daughter.\nJason eventually rushed the child to Toowoomba Base Hospital on July 17, 2021.\nBy the time she arrived, Elizabeth was comatose and weighed just 13.4kg. Doctors opined she would not have survived if not for her father’s intervention.\nWhile Jason pleaded guilty and only received a suspended prison term, Kerrie opted to plead not guilty and fight the charge.\nRepresenting herself in July 2021, Kerrie began her address to the District Court jury by asserting she was not ‘lawyer-smart’ but had ‘nothing to hide’.\n‘I am a daughter of God,’ Kerrie told the 12 jurors.\n‘I came to the knowledge of the words in the Bible 17 years ago, that he will place his Holy Ghost on those that believe in him and that is with proof of speaking in tongues.’\nKerrie did not deny Elizabeth had gotten sick, acknowledging she had renal failure, swelling on the brain and a blood clot.\nShe claimed this was the ‘hand of God’ hovering over her child.\nKerrie Struhs (pictured) told a District Court in July 2021 that she was a ‘daughter of God’ after she pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge\nStruhs told the court (pictured) that her daughter was sick but claimed her illness was the ‘hand of God’ hovering over her child\nKerrie told the jurors many of them placed their hand on the Bible and made their oaths while being sworn in for the trial.\n‘That must mean you believe in a God, that is able to help you, that’s a power.\n‘As I said, the things that are inside the Bible, that you said ‘so help me God’ to, he’s the one that I trust and will believe.\n‘He says in there: ‘Do not put trust in man’.’\nShe continued saying sickness was ‘given by God’ and in this case, he was trying to show ‘everyone he is there’.\nKerrie railed against the medical system, referencing disgraced ex-surgeon Jayant ‘Dr Death’ Patel, for wrong medications being assigned by doctors and confusion around the Covid-19 pandemic.\n‘I believe I’m here today to simply tell you there is a God and you need to turn to him because his judgment is coming,’ she told the jurors.\n‘I don’t believe I am being judged today in this court.\n‘I’ve been judged, I’ve turned to the Lord. He has judged me righteously.\n‘This is for you to work that out for yourselves.’\nPlaying chicken in the name of faith\nWithin the hour of Kerrie’s submissions, a jury would find her guilty on the count of failing to supply the necessaries of life.\nAsked if she had to say anything in reply, Kerrie only gave a slight, trembling reply: ‘No, Your Honour.’\n‘I won’t be getting legal representation. I’m not familiar with the processes,’ she told Judge Jennifer Rosengren.\nCrown prosecutor Shontelle Petrie had explained Kerrie had known Elizabeth’s life was in serious decline in the days prior to her hospitalisation.\nShe argued Kerrie’s lack of any criminal history and parental responsibilities could not overwhelm a sentence of imprisonment.\nThe delay in seeking medical attention meant lifesaving devices had to be used by hospital staff to save the girl, along with tireless work by medical staff to resuscitate Elizabeth, Ms Petrie said.\nProsecutors argued that the Kerrie knew Elizabeth’s (pictured right) health was deteriorating significantly before she was admitted to hospital where she was weighed at just 13.4kg\n‘The lesson that you can’t play chicken in the name of faith does need to be learned, if not by Mrs Struhs then by others,’ she said.\nMs Petrie said a cloak of faith did not permit Kerrie from abdicating her duty to protect her child.\n‘The delay in seeking treatment exacerbated the symptoms,’ she said.\nWhen asked if she had anything to say in her favour, a tearful Kerrie told the court she was being taken away from her children.\n‘I tried to do everything right in my life, so I have no criminal history,’ she sobbed.\n‘I have nothing else to say.’\nJudge Rosengren asked: ‘Nothing else to tell me about your personal circumstances at all?’\n‘I’m not sure what else there is to say,’ Kerrie responded.\n‘Elizabeth has no long-term effects. My husband takes her to see a diabetes doctor.\n‘He comes home and tells me how well the doctor sees Elizabeth is doing. She’s got nothing wrong with her.’\nKerrie Struhs told the court she was being taken away from her children when asked if she had anything to say in her favour (pictured stock image of a judge gavel)\nJudge Rosengren ultimately jailed her for 18 months’ jail, ordering she be released on parole after serving five months.\nShe said Kerrie had shown no insight or remorse to what had occurred.\n‘It is of some concern that you told the police that you would do the same again, even knowing of the dire situation that your daughter was in when she was taken to the hospital,’ Judge Rosengren said during her sentencing.\n‘(Elizabeth) was plainly unable to care or look after herself or to make an informed decision whether or not to obtain medical attention.\n‘You failed to seek it for her.. you added to the grave danger she faced and extended her suffering needlessly.’\n14 to face judge-only trial\nThroughout their committal proceedings, members of the group derided the charges, calling them ‘disgusting’ and insisting they were acting out of love and concern for Elizabeth, among other claims.\nAll members have repeatedly declined to seek legal representation.\nSome have refused to read the brief of evidence detailing the Crown’s case against them, or acknowledge they have received critical material related to their cases while in custody.\nNone of the 14 has applied for bail.\nBrendan Luke Stevens (pictured), who is the leader of a religious group known as The Saints, was charged with Elizabeth’s alleged murder\nThese attitudes continued even during higher court proceedings when Mr Schoenfisch, on the first trial review date last April 6, defiantly said the group was ‘not bothered’ by any potential outcome of the case against them.\n‘We’re not bothered by the outcome, we’re not worried how we can escape years and years of jail,’ he told the court.\n‘You can’t force us to get legal representation.’\nOn November 27, an application to have all 14 co-accused tried before a judge instead of a jury was granted.\nChief Justice Helen Bowskill said Brendan Stevens was charged with murder on the basis he allegedly counselled one or both of Elizabeth’s parents to not provide her medication knowing she would be harmed if she didn’t receive it.\nJason’s murder charge related to his alleged failure to provide insulin and or did not provide medical care for his daughter, knowing that failing to do so would cause her death.\nElizabeth’s father Jason Struhs (pictured) allegedly failed to provide his daughter with insulin for her diabetic condition along with medical care for the girl\nLachlan Stuart Schoenfisch (pictured top) and his wife Samantha (pictured bottom centre) are are among 10 others facing manslaughter charges following the death of Elizabeth Struhs\n‘Kerrie Struhs…is charged with manslaughter on the basis that she failed to provide insulin to Elizabeth and or did not provide medical treatment for her,’ Justice Bowskill said.\nThe remaining 11 manslaughter charges related to allegations ‘they counselled and or procured and or aided Elizabeth’s parents to unlawfully kill her’.\nIn a prior review Mr Stevens used his time in court to complain that the 14 co-accused did not have any opportunities provided to discuss the case together while in custody on remand.\nIt is understood several members of the group are being held in separate jails.\nOn September 22, Mr Stevens said they did not have access to get on emails or a phone from prison.\nBut Justice Burns rejected this.\n‘I’ve set up a protocol for contacts, there’s any number…Corrective Services are on board with this,’ Justice Burns said.\n‘It was indicated to you if you wanted to meet in advance, that could be arranged. All you needed to do was make a request and I would do my best to facilitate it.’\nHe suggested an easier solution to discuss the matter would be to apply for bail – something all 14 members have indicated no interest in doing.\nDuring discussions about jury trials, Mr Stevens told Justice Burns: ‘We don’t believe we will get any more justice from a jury than we believe we will already get without one.’\nJason Struhs also raised concerns about splitting potential trials among the group.\nHe said there was a heightened risk of the members not getting a fair trial if several members were heard before others.\nJason also complained about the media’s publicity of the case.\n‘We’ve already been labelled by the media anyway…they’ve already labelled us all these different stuff,’ he said.\n‘How can you put it out in the public and trust them?’",

    "text": "Press Release California woman sentenced to prison for making anti-Semitic phone threats to former Executive Director of Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue Friday, May 24, 2024 Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of Florida MIAMI – Melanie Harris, 59 of Riverside, California, was sentenced yesterday to 32 months in prison, to be followed by 3 years of supervised release, after previously pleading guilty to knowingly and intentionally transmitting a threatening communication in interstate commerce. Harris was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman during a hearing in Miami, Florida.\n“Defendant Melanie Harris’s anti-Semitic threats terrorized a Jewish family,” stated U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida. “Her hate-filled telephone calls and voicemails were abhorrent. No one should live in fear of threats, harassment, and hate-fueled violence. There is simply no place in our society for anyone who threatens Jews or anyone else in our diverse South Florida community. The U.S. Attorney’s Office, along with our FBI partners, will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute those that threaten our safety and security, while seeking justice for the victims impacted by these vile crimes.”\n“Melanie Harris sent threatening communications to a Jewish family using vile and inflammatory language. The nature of her threats of violence towards the victims and their faith were clearly meant to evoke a climate of fear and intimidation. Such conduct cannot be tolerated,” said Jeffrey B. Veltri, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami Field Office. “Violence through words or actions is unacceptable and the FBI will continue to do everything we can to identify, arrest, and bring to justice those who engage in similar conduct.”\nAccording to the facts admitted at the change of plea, on Oct. 3, 2022, Harris made multiple calls to Victim 1’s cell phone, and left four separate threatening voicemails, with the intent to communicate a true threat and with the knowledge that the communications would be seen as true threats. In one of these four October 3 voicemails, Harris stated in relevant part: “I’ll cut your f head off kiker.” The term “kike” has long been used as an anti-Semitic slur aimed at Jews.\nNeither Victim 1 nor his wife, Victim 2, knew the identity of the person (Harris) calling Victim 1 with these threatening and harassing calls and voicemails. Nor did they know where the calls were coming from because Harris concealed her phone number using the *67 feature. However, all of these calls originated from the Riverside, California area, where Harris lived at the time, and were received by Victim 1’s phone in the Southern District of Florida.\nYesterday’s sentencing hearing and related court filings referenced additional information regarding Harris’ criminal conduct. As was addressed in court, for over four years, Harris harassed and threatened three victims by making over two-hundred and forty calls to Victim 1, leaving messages and engaging in conversations where she unleashed anti-Semitic hate and direct threats against Victim 1, his family, and Jews in general. In these calls and voicemails, Harris made incessant references to the congregants murdered in the October 2018 massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In these calls and voicemails Harris repeatedly referred to Victim 3 by their first name, in anti-Semitic and violent terms. Harris also made vile references to Anne Frank being murdered by the Nazis, Jews going back to Auschwitz, and in one voicemail, played for the Court at the sentencing hearing, she repeatedly screamed “Seig Heil, Kill Kikers” over and over before hanging up.\nHarris’ four-year onslaught of harassment and threats of the victims was compounded by the fact that until July 2018, Victim 1 had been the Executive Director of the Tree of Life for over 20 years, while his wife, Victim 2, and her adult child, Victim 3, were all long-time members of, and closely associated with, the Tree of Life.\nDuring the course of her calls, Harris blocked her phone number from being detected by Victim 1’s caller identification system, leaving the victims bereft of any knowledge of who the harasser was or where the person might be, putting them in constant fear for their lives until Harris’s arrest in March 2023. In addition, on the same day in February 2019 that Harris began her calls to Victim 1, she also began calling the Tree of Life leaving virtually identical hate-filled anti-Semitic messages referencing the deaths of the elderly worshippers.\nThe FBI's Miami Area Corruption Task Force, which also investigates civil rights violations, investigated the case. FBI Pittsburgh, FBI Los Angeles Riverside Resident Agency, and the Riverside Police Department in California, provided invaluable assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Edward N. Stamm and Nardia Haye prosecuted the case, which was indicted by Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney Harry C. Wallace, Jr.\nIn Sept. 2022, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland started the United Against Hate program to convene local forums that connect community groups to federal, state, and local law enforcement to increase community understanding and reporting of hate crimes; build trust between law enforcement and communities; and create and strengthen alliances between law enforcement and other government partners and community groups to combat unlawful acts of hate. The United Against Hate program represents a “whole of government” approach to combating hate crimes.
