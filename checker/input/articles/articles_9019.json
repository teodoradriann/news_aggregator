    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that | Wyoming Public Media",
    "text": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that Tucked into a hallway at the Republican National Convention, between booths promoting the Second Amendment and another selling official merchandise of the Trump Campaign, sat a sprawling display of the conservative legacy in environmentalism. Young conservatives ran back and forth asking convention goers with Nixon pins if they were familiar with former President Richard Nixon’s environmental policy. They approached oil lobbyists about the need for climate change conversations. They handed out stickers to rising young Republican voters. “The word ‘Conservative’ is in ‘conservation,’” said Aidan Shank, one member of the American Conservation Coalition, the environmental group that set up the booth. For years, the Republican Party has gotten a reputation for denying climate science and the urgency of global warming. Their statements about the environment usually focus on burning more fossil fuels, the biggest driver of climate change. But this year, for the first time in recent memory, conservatives had a climate showing at the Republican National Convention. The leadership of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC) flew to Milwaukee for a week of conversations around climate, conservation, and energy. They kept up efforts to win delegates’ attention and support, even as their party nominated former President Donald Trump, who doesn’t acknowledge the full effects of human-caused climate change and has vowed to rescind many of President Biden’s climate-related investments. Young conservatives are likely to support Trump this November. Still, they want to see their party talk about climate and energy policy. They see potential for a Trump administration to prioritize domestic production of clean energy. Unlike their Democratic counterparts–and prevailing climate science—they also still back oil and gas development. “We can be hopeful. And our approach has always been to work with people where we can,” said Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of ACC. She added: “We really are using this RNC to introduce ourselves to the base, and to stakeholders, and to say there's a better way to do environmental policy.” Young conservatives hope to reframe the conversation On their first morning in Milwaukee, six members of ACC got ready at an Airbnb for their convention debut. Decked out with their American flag caps, brown Tevoca boots, American flag belt and button-up shirt with bison, they planned out their RNC reception event schedule: arrive at 1 pm, do a reception hosted by another group, and have time to visit, talk to dozens of people over five hours. ACC was an RNC sponsor, cementing its mark at the Republican gathering. It's considered a significant milestone for the group, which formed in 2017 during the first Trump administration. At its inception, it quickly attracted young politicos like Stephen Perkins, the 29-year-old chief operating officer of ACC. “I grew up going camping and with my dad and fishing and all that sort of stuff. And so we've always had an appreciation for the environment and the outdoors,” said Perkins, of the Texas places he grew up in and loved. “As I got more involved in politics, the issues that I gravitated toward were the tougher ones.” Perkins likes to talk to fellow young conservatives about the impact of climate change on most policy issues. He recalled when one young Republican told him that he didn’t care about climate — that he was more concerned about immigration. Perkins had an answer for him. “Not the only reason, but a big reason why people are coming here is many of them are climate refugees,” Perkins said of the explanation he gave about immigration “There are places where whether it's flooding or extreme heat, they're coming here to escape that. And so there's actually a connection.” Generally, Republicans have not seen climate as their issue. And leaders, like Trump and Vance, have championed fossil fuel production over conservation and climate action. “He’s (Trump) not perfect. We certainly recognize that. He needs to talk about climate change,” Perkins said. “But when you talk about seven years ago when ACC was started, you couldn't get Republican elected officials to even talk about climate change.” Some of that has evolved. During the first GOP debate, an ACC member asked presidential candidates running against Trump how they would ease fears that the GOP doesn’t care about climate. There were few direct answers. Although climate is not a top issue for Republicans, i [t does rank higher on the list of policy priorities for younger Republican](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/25/1195566969/climate-change-made-it-in-the-gop-debate-some-young-republicans-say-thats-a-win)s. The steps are small but ACC hopes a younger generation of conservatives can reframe the conversation. One way of doing so was with the large booth at the convention. Most visitors were curious and generally supportive. They picked up stickers, and fliers and colored a large poster that spelled out the word “legacy.” There was the occasional pushback — like an oil lobbyist who denied climate change. “Approaching every conversation with empathy is the first place to begin,” said Aidan Shank, who was staffing the ACC table. “There's so many places where we can agree, and just assuming that the conversation revolves around finding those agreements, sometimes that's the most constructive way to create dialogue.” The leaders at ACC wanted to create the organization in order to facilitate the conversations Shank is having at the convention now. Like Perkins, Danielle Butcher Franz grew up in the outdoors. Raised in a more liberal family, she said she never thought of the environment as a partisan issue, until she started talking to others. “As we would speak to our peers, we would notice over and over them saying things like, ‘I'm conservative except on the environment’ or ‘I want to support Democrats because of climate change,’” Butcher Franz said. Though she generally feels welcome in her conservative spaces, she at first had to fight stereotypes. “On the right, you would sort of have this skepticism of, ‘Are you really conservatives, or is this like a Trojan horse for big government solutions that we don't agree with?’ ” Butcher Franz said, noting that she also pushes back against stereotypes about Republican interest in climate. “It can be frustrating to have to constantly feel like you're in myth-busting mode, and you have to constantly dispel these preconceived notions that people have about what you believe and what you stand for,” Butcher Franz said. Republicans celebrate being at the convention — at all Later in the day, the group gathers inside the Mitchell Park Domes Horticulture Conservatory to host a reception with dozens of guests and to talk about energy innovation, and Republicans’ long involvement with the environment. Mainly, they wanted to celebrate being at the convention. Nearly all the speakers acknowledged that this kind of convention presence was new and signals a turning tide. In remarks, ACC President Chris Barnard noted that he believed this was a historic event. “This is the first time something like this has happened at a Republican convention — we have a conservative climate reception,” he proudly told the crowd. Talking with NPR, Barnard says he still feels like there is a stereotype that to care about climate or conservation is to be a Democrat. But he wants to see the GOP — even Trump and Vance — to take advantage of the issue. “It's politically very popular,” Barnard said. “And so the first thing to say really is that for anyone in the Republican Party, that's not championing that message: That's really just a lost opportunity.” Barnard saw speaking to delegates and other 2024 candidates at the convention as a foot in the door. And he hopes ACC’s conversations, the booth and receptions encourage them to address climate in their local races. “It's important to talk to them and kind of equip them with the messaging and how they can talk about these issues,” Barnard said. “And hoping that there's a good opportunity to work with Republicans on important environmental and climate policies.” Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "title": "Un extraño problema en la pantalla de los Amazon Kindle Colorsoft está retrasando los envíos",
    "text": "El lanzamiento del primer Kindle a color de la historia no está yendo muy bien. Amazon comenzó los envíos del Colorsoft el 30 de octubre, pero las entregas se interrumpieron después de que algunos clientes se quejaran de una peculiar \"línea amarilla\" en la parte inferior de la pantalla y de una aparente decoloración en los bordes. Amazon trabaja en la solución y ofrece un reemplazo o el reembolso.\nAhí es donde surge el otro problema\nAntes del lanzamiento, Amazon lanzó una promoción en la que anunciaba que sus clientes podían intercambiar su antiguo Kindle por un 20% de descuento [en el Colorsoft](https://es.wired.com/articulos/por-que-tardo-tanto-el-kindle-colorsoft-amazon-revela-la-razon-de-la-demora). Algunos de estos clientes ahora están devolviendo su nuevo dispositivo a color debido a los \"desperfectos\", lo que les deja sin lector electrónico. El fabricante aún no ha proporcionado ninguna información concreta sobre cuándo se solucionará el problema del Colorsoft y cuándo se reanudarán los envíos. Un desastre total.\nTodo comenzó con un anuncio de descuento por tiempo limitado en el [Kindle Colorsoft](https://es.wired.com/articulos/primer-kindle-a-color-esta-aqui-precio-y-disponibilidad-nuevo-kindle-colorsoft) del programa de canje de Amazon. Si el dispositivo cumplía con los requisitos, había que responder a unas preguntas sobre su estado y enviarlo. Una vez que el sistema lo evaluara, el valor del canje aparecería en forma de tarjeta de regalo. La empresa también ofrecía un 20% de descuento adicional en el Colorsoft junto con el crédito de canje. Con la esperanza de recibir el nuevo e-reader a color, algunos clientes decidieron acogerse al programa enviando sus antiguos Kindle, pero los inesperados problemas de pantalla hicieron que esto no saliera según lo planeado. Las quejas se trasladaron rápidamente del cajón de comentarios de Amazon, con una puntuación promedio de 2.5/5 estrellas, a Reddit.\nCabe señalar que no todo el mundo se ha encontrado con este incoveniente, yo no noté ninguna línea amarilla en mi Colorsoft; pero si es tu caso, debes ponerte en contacto con el equipo de atención al cliente de Amazon para solicitar un reembolso o un reemplazo. Aquí es donde las cosas se complican: si optas por la devolución y has utilizado el descuento, solo te devolverán la cantidad exacta que pagaste. Como el cupón del 20% ya no es válido, tendrás que pagar el precio completo del Colorsoft cuando Amazon vuelva a enviarlo. No obstante, si decides esperar a que te lo cambien, tendrás que aguardar entre tres y cinco semanas para recibir el modelo de sustitución.\nEsperar hasta mediados de diciembre puede estar bien para algunos, pero los que cambiaron sus anteriores [e-readers](https://es.wired.com/articulos/lectores-de-ebook-con-pantalla-a-color-kobo-clara-colour-y-kobo-libra-colour) se quedan sin dispositivos. Incluso si los clientes deciden utilizar el reembolso para comprar un nuevo Paperwhite o Kindle básico, no pueden aprovechar las promociones de canje porque ya no tienen dispositivos que enviar. En su lugar, tendrán que pagar el precio completo. Según varios comentarios en la página del producto Colorsoft en Amazon, los representantes del servicio de atención al cliente han dicho a los clientes que el descuento original no se puede transferir a otro Kindle. No ayuda mucho que la nueva línea de lectores electrónicos de Amazon sea más cara que sus predecesores.\n¿A qué se deben los \"desperfectos\"?\nEl Paperwhite o Kindle básico funciona aplicando voltajes a electrodos que llevan pigmentos blancos y negros a la parte superior de cada píxel del display. Estos píxeles reflejan la luz ambiental creando un pantalla parecida al papel. En el caso del Colorsoft, el voltaje aplicado a cada electrodo es diferente y requiere de filtros a color sin demasiada luz, de lo contrario, las pantallas serían de baja resolución u oscuras.\nEn X, el analista Ming-Chi Kou sugirió que el percance con las pantallas del Colorsoft tenía que ver con el hardware. Todo parece indicar que Amazon cambió el adhesivo ópticamente transparente (OCA) por un material más opaco. Cuando el fabricante anunció su e-reader a color, afirmó que los recubrimientos estaban formulados \"a la medida\" y que mejorarían la [pantalla de color](https://es.wired.com/articulos/remarkable-integra-pantalla-a-color-en-tablets-tinta-electronica), lo cual, muchos analistas y clientes desesperados refutan rotundamente.\nNos hemos puesto en contacto con Amazon para tratar estas quejas y exponer los puntos de vista referentes a los percances en el display de los Kindle, pero la compañía no había hecho ningún comentario al cierre de esta edición. Por su parte, Ming-Chi Kou cree que la empresa se inclinará por una solución basada en software, pese a que los proveedores de componentes han desarrollado varias soluciones en hardware.\nAlgunos clientes han tenido más suerte\nDependiendo del tipo de canje, a veces Amazon deposita la tarjeta de regalo en tu cuenta al instante, siempre que envíes el dispositivo en un plazo de 30 días. Algunos conservaron su Kindle original hasta que recibieron el nuevo, mientras que un cliente consiguió una prórroga para su devolución. Los pagos instantáneos parecen aplicarse solo en EE UU. En varios hilos de Reddit, la gente en Reino Unido argumenta que Amazon tiene que evaluar sus dispositivos antes de recibir el crédito de intercambio.\nInsisto, yo no experimenté la barra amarilla o la decoloración en mi unidad de revisión, pero tengo otros comentarios sobre el Colorsoft. La pantalla a color es impresionante, pero la actualización constante para mostrar los colores y los tiempos de carga son un poco molestos; no obstante, este es un problema en la mayoría de los lectores electrónicos en color. También es demasiado caro, cuesta 80 dólares más que el Paperwhite Signature, que tiene muchas de las mismas características excepto la pantalla a color. Tampoco tiene botones de paso de página o soporte para lápiz óptico, lo que desalienta la compra.\nArtículo originalmente publicado en [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-trade-in-program/).

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. People are also reading… Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

    "text": "We’re Back!\nGov. Abbott has called a special session for the 89th Texas Legislative Session, which began Monday, July 21, and will end in 30 days! This is a powerful opportunity to keep advancing pro-life and pro-family legislation!\nIn our last legislative update, we celebrated two major victories:\nSB 31 – Life of the Mother Act: Clarifies when abortions are prohibited and protects both women and medical professionals.\nSB 33: Shuts down transactions and logistical support between governmental entities and abortion providers or assistance groups.\nAs we celebrate these victories, we still have another important pro-life and pro-woman bill to consider in this special session – and we need your help!\nSB 6 – Woman and Child Protection Act\nWe thank Gov. Abbott for hearing our voice, as CWA of Texas was one of the 130 signatures on a letter to include this bill. This bill would:\n- Strengthen pro-life laws in Texas by expanding civil enforcement mechanisms of the Texas Heartbeat Act\n- Target trafficking, distribution, and facilitation of abortion-inducing drugs\nOnce again, we will be calling on legislators in both chambers to support this bill!\nACTION: Please contact the members of the Senate State Affairs Committee and ask them to vote this bill out of committee. Be sure to let them know that you are being updated by Concerned Women for America of Texas.\nThe clock is ticking! This bill must move through committees and both chambers before the 30-day session ends.\nPRAY: Please pray for this bill to be considered by the respective committees and brought to the floor for a vote. Pray that God would give our legislators the wisdom and understanding to accomplish His purposes.\nWe anticipate the introduction of other important bills during this session, so please stay tuned for updates.\nThank you for continuing to stand with us!",

    "text": "La cirugía mínimamente invasiva con acceso por los orificios naturales del cuerpo aporta significativas ventajas para las pacientes en cuanto a la reducción del dolor postquirúrgico y menor tiempo de hospitalización, consiguiendo un alta precoz con rápida recuperación en tan sólo 12-24 horas después de la cirugía. Esta pronta recuperación permite la vuelta a la vida normal de forma inmediata con menor riesgo de infecciones, hernias u otras complicaciones.\nLa patología de alta complejidad que se puede abordar con cirugía vNOTES en el\nHospital Quirónsalud Palmaplanas incluye toda la patología uterina, así como:\n- Histerectomía\n- Salpingectomía bilateral o unilateral – Ligadura de Trompas\n- Tratamiento de patología anexial de trompas y ovarios\n- Quistes ováricos y patología ovárica benigna\n- Hidrosálpinx y piosálpinx o patología tubárica que pueda afectar en un futuro embarazo.\n- Endometriosis localizada\n- Tratamiento del prolapso de órganos pélvicos\n- Cáncer de endometrio localizado (en estadio inicial)\n¿En qué consiste la cirugía V-NOTES y cuáles son sus ventajas?\nLa cirugía V-NOTES (Vaginal Nature Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) es conocida como la cirugía sin huella puesto que utiliza orificios naturales, en este caso la vagina, para acceder a la cavidad abdominal y pélvica. De esta forma el cirujano puede visionar directamente la zona de la lesión y además se evitan cicatrices externas, hernias, adherencias o riesgos de infección.\nEn el actual servicio de Ginecología del centro, el\nDr.Rubèn Baltà es el cirujano ginecológico con más experiencia en la aplicación de este procedimiento y asegura que redunda en un gran beneficio para las pacientes: “Creo enormemente en la cirugía vNOTES ya que nos aporta un beneficio extra a nivel quirúrgico con mejor visualización de los paquetes vasculares pélvicos como son las arterias uterinas y significa un abordaje quirúrgico más estético y de mínima invasión para nuestras pacientes. La cirugía mínimamente invasiva mediante vNOTES puede significar un antes y un después en una paciente que necesita operarse e incorporarse seguidamente a su día a día por cuestiones laborales o familiares”.\nActualmente, el Hospital Quirónsalud Palmaplanas es el centro hospitalario de Baleares que realiza más intervenciones con la técnica vNOTES. Los equipos asistenciales y la tecnología disponible permiten ofrecer a las pacientes las mejores alternativas quirúrgicas para el abordaje de cirugías de alta complejidad en esta y otras especialidades.",

    "title": "El último suspiro del loro Rodrigues: un aviso sobre la extinción y el papel de los museos",
    "text": "El 14 de agosto de 1875, un loro gris-azulado fue abatido en una pequeña isla del océano Índico cerca de Mauricio, marcando el último avistamiento conocido del loro de Rodrigues. Este ave es uno de los escasos ejemplares de su especie que se conservan en la actualidad, específicamente en el Museo Universitario de Zoología de Cambridge, Inglaterra. Junto a un segundo ejemplar, son las únicas pruebas físicas de que esta especie alguna vez habitó nuestro planeta.\nLa historia del loro de Rodrigues ilustra un fenómeno conocido como «doble extinción», donde no solo se pierde el animal en sí, sino también el conocimiento de su existencia. Los museos se han convertido en los últimos refugios de muchas especies extintas, y sin estas colecciones, no solo se perderían las criaturas, sino también la memoria de su existencia.\nLa importancia de los museos en la conservación de la historia natural La función de los museos va más allá de ser meras vitrinas; son archivos de la biodiversidad del planeta. A través de sus colecciones, los investigadores pueden aprender sobre las lecciones del pasado y entender cómo ha cambiado la diversidad a lo largo del tiempo. En un libro reciente, «Nature’s Memory: Behind the Scenes at the World’s Natural History Museums», se explora esta responsabilidad de salvaguardar la evidencia de las especies que han compartido nuestro mundo.\nEl caso del loro de Rodrigues también revela sesgos de género en la historia natural. Solo un cuarto de las especies de aves se describen basándose en ejemplares femeninos, lo que significa que en muchos casos, se considera al macho como la representación estándar de la especie. Este sesgo se refleja también en el hecho de que solo el 8% de las aves nombradas en honor a personas lo son en honor a mujeres. El loro de Rodrigues, aunque a menudo se conoce como el loro de Newton, lleva el nombre de su isla de origen, resaltando así la importancia de reconocer a estos seres en su propio contexto.\nLa extinción del loro de Rodrigues se atribuye en gran medida a la deforestación provocada por la agricultura. A medida que la población de esta especie disminuyó drásticamente, el interés en su conservación se convirtió en un tema de urgencia. Edward Newton, el administrador colonial de Mauricio, desempeñó un papel clave en la recolección de ejemplares para su estudio, pero su historia está íntimamente ligada a la explotación colonial de las islas del Índico.\nLa conexión entre la extinción de especies y el colonialismo se ha vuelto un tema recurrente en la historia de la conservación. Los dodos, por ejemplo, se han convertido en símbolos de extinción, en parte debido a su abundancia en museos alrededor del mundo, gracias a la extracción de huesos realizada por trabajadores indios bajo la dirección de Newton en el siglo XIX.\nLa historia del loro de Rodrigues no es un caso aislado. En 2000, un lagarto con ojos de serpiente fue recolectado en India, pero cuando los investigadores regresaron a su hábitat, no pudieron encontrarlo, concluyendo que probablemente ya estaba extinto. Este ejemplo resalta la rapidez con la que las especies pueden desaparecer, incluso antes de ser oficialmente descritas.\nEl relato de este loro y de otras especies extintas sirve como un recordatorio de la fragilidad de nuestra biodiversidad. A medida que la pérdida de especies se acelera, es fundamental que los museos continúen preservando los vestigios de lo que hemos perdido. Cada espécimen almacenado no solo es un recordatorio de lo que existió, sino también un registro invaluable del estado de nuestro planeta.",
