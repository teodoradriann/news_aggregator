    "text": "2023-12-28 22:37:16 Published28. December 2023, 11:37 p.m. Football: Arsenal receives a lesson in efficiency and lets go of first place The Gunners were surprised at home by a lethal West Ham (0-2), at the end of the 19th day of the Premier League. They remain 2nd, two points behind Liverpool. West Ham thwarted the plans of Martin Odegaard (No 8), Gabriel Jesus (foreground) and their teammates. Imago Liverpool remains on the throne of the Premier League after the poor performance of its now runner-up, Arsenal, beaten at the Emirates Stadium by West Ham (0-2) on Thursday at the conclusion of a 19th day which saw three of the five lose leading teams. In addition to the Gunners, Tottenham was beaten at Brighton (4-2) while the 3rd, Aston Villa, gave in at the end of the match on Tuesday to Manchester United (3-2). Five days after hanging the Reds at Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal unexpectedly gave in to the team that eliminated them from the League Cup at the beginning of November. The Hammers proved the analysis of their coach David Moyes right, who assured before the match that this year was the best in the club’s history, including a triumph in the Europa Conference League. Benrahma misses a penalty They did not concede the slightest opportunity in the first half hour of play, and even scored shortly before the quarter of an hour after a poor assessment by Gabriel Magalhaes, which benefited Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13th). The former Lille defender also lost a decisive aerial duel in the second half against Konstantinos Mavropanos, following a corner from Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55th). Often effective in front of goal since the start of the season, the Gunners this time lacked realism with Saka (30th, 42nd), Martinelli (37th), Gabriel Jesus (66th) then Trossard in the last quarter of an hour. The score could have been crueler if Benrahma had converted his penalty in added time. The successive entries into play of Nketiah, Nelson and Smith Rowe reminded us of the lack of bench depth available to Mikel Arteta. Arsenal are 3 points behind Liverpool while West Ham (6th) is on the lookout for European places, 3 points from Tottenham and 4 from Manchester City, winner Tuesday at Everton (1-3) and who have a match of more to argue about. Tottenham relapses heavily Shortly before, Tottenham had suffered a severe relapse on the Brighton pitch (4-2) and missed the opportunity to get closer to the lead in the championship. However, Tottenham were the best away team before this meeting and ended the first half of the season on a negative note, despite a good 5th place in the standings, one point behind Manchester City. Better in recent weeks after a catastrophic month of November in terms of results, the Spurs showed an unusual face with a lot of passivity, as in this individual action by Joao Pedro who was able to review four players and give away a golden ball to Jack Hinshelwood, unmarked at the entrance to the penalty area (1-0, 11th). Between several clear chances for Brighton (17th, 32nd, 45th), the same Joao Pedro would then convert two penalties (23rd, 75th), with in the meantime a powerful strike from Pervis Estupinan in the opposite corner of Vicario (63rd). Alejo Veliz (81st) and Ben Davies (85th) reduced the score, too late to put the Seagulls in doubt. Brighton repositions itself in 8th place, 6 points behind first European place.

    "text": "В Китае отложили запуск модели искусственного интеллекта (ИИ) нового поколения DeepSeek из-за технических проблем. Об этом сообщает газета The Financial Times (FT).\nВ начале 2025 года китайские власти призвали DeepSeek использовать для обучения модели процессоры Huawei вместо решений от Nvidia. По словам трех знакомых с ситуацией источников, разработчик DeepSeek при переходе на китайские чипы столкнулся с многочисленными проблемами, из-за чего выпуск новой версии модели пришлось задержать.\nПо словам авторов FT, ситуация демонстрирует несовершенство процессоров Huawei и зависимость китайских IT-корпораций от технологий США. Чтобы помочь DeepSeek адаптировать процессоры для обучения ИИ, Huawei пришлось направить в офис партнера команду инженеров. Однако даже с внешней помощью произвести успешный тестовый запуск модели не удалось.\nДругой источник издания рассказал, что срыв запуска новой версии DeepSeek также связан с затянувшимся процессом сертификации от китайского регулятора. Китайские СМИ полагают, что обновленная модель будет представлена уже в ближайшие недели.\nИсследователь искусственного интеллекта из Калифорнийского университета в Беркли Ритвик Гупта заявил, что Huawei столкнулся с типичными «трудностями роста»: «То, что мы сегодня не видим передовых моделей, обученных на базе Huawei, не означает, что этого не произойдет в будущем».\nРанее китайские власти рекомендовали местным компаниям отказаться от чипов Nvidia H20 американского производства и использовать свои процессоры. H20 — самый продвинутый процессор Nvidia из тех, что разрешено продавать на китайском рынке.",

    "title": "Christian Yelich injury: Timeline, contract, Brewers outfield depth",
    "text": "What to know about Christian Yelich's back injury, severity of it, Brewers depth in outfield without him JR Radcliffe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Show Caption\nHide Caption\nChristian Yelich is having another MVP-like year Don't ask Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich for his stats. He says he doesn't know them. Those who do, know he's having a MVP-like year. The Milwaukee Brewers lost their best hitter, Christian Yelich, to the 10-day injured list Wednesday with lower back inflammation, but the recurring injury is likely to sideline him for much longer than 10 days. Milwaukee is staring down the loss of Yelich for the rest of 2024.\nHere's what we know about Yelich's injury.\nWhat exactly is the injury to Christian Yelich's back, and what did Christian Yelich say about it? Is he out for the year? The Brewers have never revealed overly detailed specifics about the injury that has been hampering Yelich for years, but Brewers manager Pat Murphy said Wednesday that a nerve issue is involved, and Yelich was slated to see a specialist in Milwaukee to consider next steps. Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reported that season-ending surgery was on the table, and Yelich's words seem to indicate that level of gravity.\nHowever, Adam McCalvy of Brewers.com and Rosenthal offered a more optimistic update on the afternoon of July 25, citing a source that indicated there was some optimism Yelich could even be back within a month and that he'd be opting for rest and rehab over surgery.\n“Go from there, as far as what's gonna be the best for the near future and into the future,” Yelich said July 24 on the day he landed on the IL, before seeing a specialist. “So a couple of different discussions I think that need to be had. And kind of try to see where we're going from that.\n“I don’t really want to get into the specifics of it, but, yeah, not great.\"\nMurphy said, \"For what Yeli does for this lineup and this clubhouse, I don’t know there’s too many players who can replace him. ... This is huge, no matter how serious. Whatever number of games we lose him for, it’s serious.\"\nWhen has Christian Yelich been sidelined by the back injury before?\nYelich missed a month of the season with a back issue from April 12 to May 8, which came as a stunner because he had started the year on fire through the first 10 games, with a 1.146 OPS. He has been on the injured list with a back issue four times before but has never required surgery.\nUpon his return, Yelich continued his steady play in his best season since the 2019 campaign, in which he took second in the National League Most Valuable Player voting. His .315 batting average and .406 on-base percentage are both tops in the National League.\nThe back issue has been tricky to negotiate. In 2023, he was sidelined briefly in May and then for a week beginning Sept. 8 in the throes of a playoff chase and, though he returned for one game Sept. 15, he was on the bench for another week immediately after that when the back issue recurred.\nA similar thing happened early in 2021, when Yelich came off the injured list in May for one game and went right back onto it with the back injury.\nWas the back injury a result of the catastrophic knee injury Christian Yelich suffered in 2019? Yelich's injury history includes an unforgettable bad break in 2019, when he fouled a ball off his knee and shattered his knee cap, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. The Brewers went on to lose in the wild-card game in dramatic fashion to Washington, which went on to win the World Series.\nYelich famously couldn't recapture his MVP form in the aftermath. After he signed a long-term extension before 2020, he struggled in the year abbreviated by COVID-19 and wasn't anywhere near the same MVP caliber of play in 2021 and 2022. But he bounced back nicely in 2023 (.818 OPS) and took yet another step forward into his 2024 season, even at age 32.\nBut the back issue predates the knee injury. In fact, he missed five games in April of 2019 with a lower back issue. He missed a couple more games in May . When he missed four games in August with the same issue, the team admitted there was no way of knowing when he might be back ; it was simply an injury that could turn a corner at any moment. That's been a familiar refrain with the back issue — an uncertainty of timeline.\nShould Christian Yelich have skipped the All-Star game? There's zero indication that Yelich appearing in the All-Star game July 16 made the situation worse, although he'd been 0-for-9 since the all-star break and mired in a 1-for-20 slump that extended to the games before the break. Remember, the issue has come and gone on a moment's notice, and the All-Star game is mild workload compared to a regular-season game.\nYelich grounded out twice in the All-Star game and played right field, fielding a line-drive single in the third and a slow-rolling single in the fifth. It was the only time he's played the field since July 9, slotting in as the designated hitter for all the Brewers games since.\nHe had been given a day off July 13 against the Nationals in a loss but played in the July 14 finale, the last game before the break, and he also appeared in the first game after the break and played all 12 innings in a July 20 win over the Twins, laying down a bunt that accounted for a run in extras. He was then held out of the next game July 21.\nWhat are Christian Yelich's stats this year? His .909 OPS is the highest he's had in his career, except for only his back-to-back incredible seasons in Milwaukee, the 2018 MVP season and the 2019 follow-up that was ended prematurely by the knee injury. In those seasons, he hadd OPS marks of 1.000 and 1.100.\nIt would be the best season OPS for any Brewers season from a player age 32 or older with at least 200 plate appearances. Russell Branyan, who had a .925 OPS at age 32 in 2008 over 152 plate appearances, is the only better mark of any player with at least 80 at-bats.\nRyan Braun had a .903 OPS in 2016 at age 32, and Aramis Ramírez had a .901 at age 34 in 2012. By OPS+, a metric that attempts to account for a player's ballparks, it's tied for the best 32-and-over mark in franchise history with Robin Yount, who was 33 in 1989 when he matched Yelich's OPS-plus of 152.\nYelich this season has 11 home runs, 42 RBIs and 21 stolen bases. He would have been in line for a third career batting title at .315 but is unlikely to have enough plate appearances now to qualify for that title.\nWhat is Christian Yelich's contract? Yelich signed a seven-year deal before the 2020 season worth $188.5 million, paying him $22 million a year, and kicking in during the 2022 season. He's owed $22 million a year for 2025-28, and then a mutual option for $20 million in 2029 (or a buyout for $6.5 million). If both sides pick up the option, he becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2030.\nIs Christian Yelich a Hall of Famer? In 2019, there was a very real case that he was on track to be a Hall of Famer, but the struggles in subsequent years — exacerbated in no small part by his back issues — have knocked him off-course.\nAccording to most metrics that track Hall of Fame likelihood, compiled at Baseball-Reference.com , Yelich is well short of the standard. Through age 31, his offensive profile is most similar to players like Andrew McCutchen, Matt Kemp, Vernon Wells and Gary Matthews.\nWhat is the Brewers' outfield depth chart in Christian Yelich's absence?\nThe Brewers are comfortable with outfield depth, although nobody will be able to match Yelich's offense.\nSince Yelich has been mostly as a DH lately, it's given ample playing time to surging rookie corner outfielder Jackson Chourio, plus young speedsters Garrett Mitchell and Sal Frelick, with Blake Perkins as a suitable backup at any spot (particularly center field).\nIn the minors, the team still has right-handed hitter Joey Wiemer, a regular contributor on last year's team, who has a .733 OPS in Class AAA Nashville, with only three homers this season in 50 games. The franchise added Brewer Hicklen, another right-handed bat, to the 40-man roster during the all-star break, and he's had a strong season at AAA. The 28-year-old corner outfielder has a .951 OPS at Nashville, with 19 homers and 28 stolen bases in 77 games.\nSigned as a free agent in November 2023, Hicklen was invited to spring training — and made an impression — but has just four big-league at-bats, coming over the course of six games with Kansas City in 2022.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "28 dez, 2023 - 19:43 • [João Pedro Quesado](https://rr.sapo.pt/artigo/337694/joao-pedro-quesado) com Agência Ecclesia O Papa pediu, esta quinta-feira, que os jovens europeus construam \"um mundo diferente\". Numa [mensagem para o Encontro Europeu de Taizé](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2023/12/28/231228a.html), Francisco recordou ainda a Jornada Mundial de Juventude em Lisboa. O Santo Padre quer que os jovens se \"atrevam\" a construir \"um mundo diferente\", baseado na \"escuta, diálogo e abertura\". \"Escutar é um ato de amor. Está no seio da confiança. Sem escutar, pouco pode crescer ou desenvolver-se. Escutar permite o espaço necessário para ser dado ao outro de forma a existir\", afirma o Papa Francisco, que lamenta a violência \"ganhar cada vez mais terreno\". \"Vivemos num tempo difícil, com conflitos e guerras travadas por todo o mundo, porque ninguém escuta\", aponta o Papa. Francisco também alerta para as formas de “marginalização, fechamento, exclusão e rejeição” de pessoas. Em resultado, convida os jovens a “construir pontes entre povos, culturas e religiões, para um mundo estável e aberto”. O Papa Francisco enviou a mensagem para o Encontro Europeu de Taizé, que decorre anualmente, no final do ano. Desta vez, a iniciativa tem lugar em Liubliana, a capital da Eslovénia, entre esta quinta-feira e o dia 1 de janeiro.",

    "text": "Fiéis aproveitam “mutirão” de confissões antes da chegada da Páscoa Arcebispo de Campo Grande, Dom Dimas Lara Barbosa, recebeu declarações dos fiéis na Paróquia São João Batista Igreja lotada e entrega de senhas para confissões. O cenário esta manhã na Paróquia São João Batista, no bairro Coophasul, foi de busca por perdão. Quem procurou a igreja nesta manhã acabou encontrando o arcebispo de Campo Grande, Dom Dimas Lara Barbosa, que também recebeu as declarações dos fiéis junto com outros padres da paróquia. “As confissões ocorreram durante toda a quaresma, hoje é apenas um “mutirão”, para quem deixou pra última hora o rito”, disse ele, lembrando que as pessoas buscam se confessar mais neste momento de Páscoa porque “a morte de Cristo, quando ele deu a vida por nós, é o momento de as pessoas deixarem tudo aquilo de errado que elas já fizeram e se arrependerem”, assinalou. Com a senha 104 em mãos e emocionada, a gerente Daniele Junqueira Rodrigues, 37 anos, disse que a última vez que ela se confessou tem 20 anos, quando ela crismou (sacramento da Crisma é considerado a confirmação do Batismo pelo Espírito Santo). Ficou afastada muito [tempo](https://www.campograndenews.com.br/tempo) até que a filha dela, de 10 anos de idade, pediu para fazer catequese (ensino da doutrina católica). “Eu e meu marido então decidimos procurar uma igreja e até ele, que nunca foi de nenhuma religião, resolveu participar e vai se batizar domingo”, contou a mulher. Chorando, ela ainda lembrou da importância da igreja em sua vida. “Quando eu era mais nova, participava obrigada pela minha mãe, mas não entendia a importância de Jesus na minha vida.” Também esperando serem chamados ao confessionário, o eletricista Roner Rosa do Nascimento , 32 anos, e a esposa, dona de casa Stephanye Brandão Rosa, 28 anos, comentam que a Páscoa é a data mais importante da igreja, dia de constrição e meditação. “Foi o evento mais importante que aconteceu”, disse Roner. Para a esposa, além disso, é importante ensinar as filhas de 1 e 9 anos de idade a entenderem o que aconteceu na data. “Não é só um feriado”. Por fim, Mário Rosa de Almeida, 61 anos, afirma que “somos importantes para Jesus, tanto que ele morreu pela gente. É a imensidão do amor dele por nós que me faz retribuir um pouco desse amor”, disse. Quando falou com o Campo Grande News ele segurava a senha 97. “Não me importo em esperar, porque a gente na Terra não sabe se amanhã estará vivo”. Receba as principais notícias do Estado pelo Whats.

    "title": "Community remembers forensic pathologist Werner Spitz",
    "text": "Spitz testified in many high-profile cases. Photo provided by Walter P. Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State University METRO DETROIT — From testifying at the O.J. Simpson civil case in 1996 to offering his perspective in the Chappaquiddick incident that involved Ted Kennedy and Mary Jo Kopechne in 1969, Werner Spitz was widely known for providing his expertise on the witness stand. The prominent forensic pathologist was sought after in the court system for his knowledge in forensic evidence and his testimony regarding many high-profile murders that drew public interest and media attention. The longtime chief medical examiner — who performed or supervised more than 60,000 autopsies during his career — died April 14 at the age of 97. He was a resident of Grosse Pointe Shores. Many in the community are remembering the well-known forensic expert. Warren City Council member Mindy Moore felt “very sad” when she learned Spitz died. Moore, a freelance court reporter, has known Spitz since the late 1970s when he was the chief Wayne County medical examiner. She was present for many depositions he provided over the years. “What an icon he was. He was quite brilliant and so effective,” she said. “He had a way about him. His whole career was fascinating. When he spoke, all eyes were on him. You knew what he would say would be impactful and very important. He certainly was one of a kind.” Sometimes the evidence presented in court could be very technical, and Moore said Spitz was always able to explain it “so any lay person could understand him.” One deposition that stands out was the time the forensics expert testified in a case to determine whether a man committed suicide or was murdered. With the unloaded firearm in his hand, the pathologist laid on the floor to demonstrate that the deceased man could not have killed himself at the particular angle in which he died. Despite the gruesome work he did, Moore, at times, saw the medical examiner in another light. “He had a really good sense of humor,” she said. According to his resume, Spitz practiced forensic pathology for more than 50 years. He was the chief medical examiner in Wayne County from 1972-88 and in Macomb County from 1972-2004. He also served as a deputy chief medical examiner in Maryland. He received his medical training at the Geneva University Medical School in Switzerland and the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem. His resume states he was an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins University, and that he worked for the Department of Legal Medicine at the University School of Medicine in West Berlin. Throughout his lifetime, Spitz served on various committees investigating the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. He testified at various trials in the U.S. and Canada including the “Preppy Murder” in New York, the talk show host Jenny Jones case, the Crown vs. Truscott in Toronto, music producer Phil Spector’s murder trial and the Casey Anthony murder case. He also consulted with the police in Boulder, Colorado about the death of JonBenét Ramsey. Steve Bieda, a 37th District Court judge in Warren, recalled how when he was in the Michigan Legislature as a state representative and senator, the elected officials often contacted Spitz for advice regarding criminal justice issues. “He was highly regarded and would be asked to weigh his opinions based on his expertise,” Bieda said. “He was iconic in the sense of high-profile crime.” On a personal level, Bieda followed Spitz’s work on the Oakland County child killer case in the 1970s and his work related to President Kennedy’s death. “He was a fascinating individual and very charismatic,” Bieda said. Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel met Spitz in 1981 when he worked as a dispatcher on the midnight shift for the Macomb County Sheriff’s Office. On his first night, Hackel took a call from a Macomb Township man who reported that his neighbor killed his wife and children. But the caller “was the guy that did it,” Hackel said. “That’s when I first got to know Spitz, who left an impression.” “He was the guy that could tell you what happened just by looking at the body,” Hackel said. “He tried to put himself in their place. He wanted to know the circumstances of how they died. I don’t know of a time when he wasn’t spot on.” Hackel said many law enforcement officers he worked with over the years were interested in what Spitz had to offer. Hackel said Spitz was always kind when speaking to families of the victims. “I am so sad about his loss, but I am fortunate to have known him,” Hackel said. “He was the forefather of pathology. I don’t know if you will see another like that.” During his career, Spitz taught at different colleges, including pathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit. “He was a great teacher and a huge contributor to the field of pathology and forensics,” said Dr. Wael Sakr, dean of the Wayne State University School of Medicine. “He had a huge presence and was a consultant on many big profile cases across the country. Before I knew him, I had a lot of admiration toward him.” Spitz returned to the school on occasion to present seminars to students. “He was interested in human life and, sadly, was trying to solve death, particularly in trauma, accidents, homicides and burns,” Sakr said. “He had a love for the discipline in what he did and was meticulous in his approach.” Sakr will definitely feel his loss. “I enjoyed his friendship and his support for the department,” Sakr said. Spitz’s legacy includes the nearly 100 scientific publications he authored, the Dean’s Award for service to the Medicolegal Community and Wayne State University of Medicine, awards from Wayne County and the Macomb County Board of Commissioners for outstanding service, and from various police departments and the FBI.",
