    "title": "Inaugural Jaguars Swim Club Launches at Spelman College: Empowering Black Women in Aquatics",
    "text": "On Sunday, October 20, Spelman ’s Wellness Center proudly hosted an exhibition event marking the launch of the inaugural Jaguars Swim Club. As a vital component of Spelman’s comprehensive aquatics program, this club proudly holds the distinction of being the first-ever all-women’s swimming club established at a historically Black college or university ( HBCU ). This groundbreaking initiative is spearheaded by the newly appointed Adrienne Wesley, who serves as Spelman’s Aquatics Director and is also the head coach of the club.\nThe exciting exhibition featured 14 club members, comprising both dedicated students and staff members, who showcased their skills by competing in a variety of individual and relay events. Participants engaged in individual medley, butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle events, spanning distances between 25 to 100 yards. Additionally, they participated in competitive 4 x 50 yards relay events, further displaying their versatility and teamwork.\nSamiyah Young, C’2025, a biology major hailing from Chicago, leads the club team’s executive board with enthusiasm as its president. Drawing from her extensive experience as a former competitive swimmer, she brings a wealth of knowledge, skills, and leadership to the team, inspiring her peers.\n“Leading this team means not only fostering community but also creating a space where Black women can thrive in a sport that often lacks representation,” said Young during the event. “Swimming at Spelman is a powerful way to challenge norms, break barriers, and represent in and out of the water.”\nIn addition to providing valuable opportunities to compete, the club is committed to enhancing participants’ swimming abilities, promoting fitness, and actively working to discredit the stereotypes and disparities that persist within the Black community regarding swimming.\n“The Spelman Jaguars Swim Team is not just about competition,” emphasized Coach Wesley. “It represents empowerment and community for Black women. Swimming fosters confidence, resilience, and camaraderie among our students, providing them with valuable life skills both in and out of the pool.”\nThe club team is aspiring to compete in College Club Swimming under the umbrella of the U.S. Masters Swimming organization, which aims to increase participation in swimming at HBCUs across the country, thereby enriching the athletic landscape for future generations.\nAmari Ann, C’2027, an enthusiastic member of the Jaguars Swim Club, has dedicated over 13 years to swimming, including five years spent competing. “I love being a part of the Swim Club at Spelman… I took a break from the competitive realm in high school, so I hadn’t swum competitively in 4 years,” expressed Ann, a political science major from New Orleans. “…It’s such a family-oriented thing. I’m going to move into coaching sooner or later, so I’m interested in that to sharpen my skills.”\nFor those interested in joining or learning more about the club, please reach out to Adrienne Wesley in the Wellness Center at adriennewesley@spelman.edu or follow SpelmanAquatics1881 on Instagram for updates and information.\n**Interview with Samiyah⁣ Young, President of the ⁤Jaguars Swim Club at Spelman College**\n**Editor:** Thank you for taking the time to speak‌ with us, ⁣Samiyah!

    "title": "Trading hiking trails for indoor climbing gym in Nuremberg offers boulder blast | Stars and Stripes",
    "text": "Quick Trips Trading hiking trails for indoor climbing gym in Nuremberg offers boulder blast Stars and Stripes September 5, 2024 Trying to find an activity that satiates my need for outdoor adventure becomes difficult as the cooler months in Bavaria approach, so I’ve been increasingly looking to indoor spots. Boulderhalle E4, a climbing gym in the heart of Nuremberg, was exactly what I had in mind. With more than 32,000 square feet of intricate walls, it’s one of the largest bouldering centers in the country, according to the company’s website. I decided to drag along a friend who also had minimal experience bouldering, and as two amateur climbers, we didn’t know what to expect. We were greeted by a pristine, modern gym with a small bistro. Tables and booths were set among the check-in area, with a shop carrying clothes and climbing gear. Staffers at E4 were very friendly as they helped us purchase a discounted day pass and rent the appropriate gear: a chalk bag and climbing shoes. They took care in explaining the seven beginner to expert grading levels we would come across, along with the safety measures. Color-coordinated tags identify the difficulty of the routes, which are changed every week. My friend and I settled on the intermediate courses and found them to be perfect for our skill level. While resting between climbs, I observed the range of patrons, from small groups of semiprofessional climbers traversing the most difficult routes to kids unloading their energy with their families. My friend and I spent about two hours at the gym. At one point, we wandered off to explore one of two upstairs training areas, where there were training walls, pull-up bars and TRX bands for more experienced climbers. After expending ourselves to the point of being unable to grasp another hold, we decided to call it a day and head to the bistro for some snacks. Although it didn’t have any to-go cups for coffee, I eyed a fridge with a few bottled beers and wines, which may have piqued my interest had it not been mid-morning on a Saturday. I settled on purchasing a few specialty protein bars for the one-hour drive home. Boulderhalle E4 offered an array of climbing challenges that I’m eager to visit again throughout the upcoming winter. It will definitely tide me over until the hiking trails beckon in the spring. Boulderhalle E4 Address: Allersberger Strasse 185, Nuremberg, Germany Hours: Monday-Thursday, 9 a.m.-11 p.m.; Friday-Sunday, 8 a.m.-11 p.m. .Prices: Adults, 14 euros (military discount available); children, 7 euros (2-5 years old), 9 euros (6-13 years old); shoe rental, 4 euros; chalk bag, 2 euros Information: Phone: +49 911 49042202; online: boulderhalle-e4.de",

The Kremlin said on Thursday that Vladimir Putin had given Kim Jong Un an Aurus as a gift because the North Korean leader liked the car when the Russian president showed it to him last year.

    "text": "Ter a pele e os cabelos saudáveis é o sonho de qualquer pessoa. Para isso, muitos acreditam que precisam investir em diversos cremes, óleos e outros produtos de skincare . Contudo, embora esses produtos possam ajudar, uma dieta equilibrada é sempre a melhor alternativa.\nContinua depois da publicidade\n“Há muitos produtos no mercado, como as máscaras e os cremes de hidratação, que contêm aminoácidos, antioxidantes, ferro, zinco e biotina na composição. Eles são essenciais para a saúde dos fios, por exemplo, mas não agem sozinhos. É preciso contar com a ajuda da alimentação para dar uma força a mais na ação destes produtos”, explica o hair stylist Luigi Moretto.\nPensando nisso, listamos 7 alimentos que, quando consumidos, ajudam a nutrir a pele e os cabelos. Confira!\nContinua depois da publicidade\n1. Ovo Rico em proteínas, vitaminas e minerais, o ovo ajuda a fortalecer os folículos capilares, promovendo cabelos mais saudáveis e resistentes à quebra. Além disso, por conter vitaminas do complexo B, como a biotina e a riboflavina, estimula o crescimento dos fios e ajuda a manter a saúde do couro cabeludo. Para a pele, é uma fonte rica de colina, que auxilia na manutenção da integridade das membranas celulares, promovendo uma pele mais firme e saudável.\nTodavia, a nutricionista Gabriela Marcelino alerta que é necessário consumi-lo com cautela. “De uma forma geral, adultos saudáveis podem consumir de 3 a 4 unidades na semana, intercalando com o consumo de outras proteínas, como aves, carnes e peixes. Para quem faz controle de colesterol, deve apenas ficar atento para não exceder o total de colesterol do dia”, recomenda.\n2. Cenoura A cenoura é um alimento rico em betacaroteno, um precursor da vitamina A, que ajuda a promover a renovação celular da pele, mantendo-a saudável, e estimula a produção de sebo, um óleo natural presente no couro cabeludo que deixa os fios hidratados.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nPor ser uma rica fonte de antioxidantes, o legume também combate os danos causados pelos radicais livres, reduzindo os sinais de envelhecimento da pele e fortalecendo os folículos capilares, o que pode resultar em cabelos mais fortes e brilhantes.\n“Dietas menos inflamatórias diminuem a degradação do colágeno, uma proteína que mantém nossa pele mais firme. Recomendamos frutas ricas em antioxidantes, verduras, legumes e proteínas”, explica a dermatologista Dra. Mônica Aribi.\n3. Peixe Os ácidos graxos ômega 3 presentes nos peixes, como salmão, sardinha e atum, fortalecem os folículos capilares e promovem mais brilho aos cabelos. No caso da pele, mantém a hidratação, reduzindo a secura e a descamação. “Os ácidos graxos do tipo ômega 3 são importantes para manter equilíbrio de perfil inflamatório da pele e prevenir doenças inflamatórias como as dermatites, psoríase e acne”, explica a nutróloga Dra. Marcella Garcez.\nContinua depois da publicidade\n4. Laranja A laranja é uma fruta rica em vitamina C, um poderoso antioxidante que ajuda a combater os danos causados pelos radicais livres e é essencial para a produção de colágeno, que mantém a elasticidade da pele, reduzindo a aparência de rugas e linhas de expressão. Além disso, contém betacaroteno que, assim como na cenoura, quando convertido em vitamina A pelo organismo, hidrata e fortalece os fios.\n“Os antioxidantes na dieta podem desempenhar um papel importante na prevenção do envelhecimento da pele e anexos cutâneos, pois são compostos que ajudam a proteger as células do corpo contra os danos causados pelos radicais livres, moléculas instáveis que podem causar estresse oxidativo, que está associado ao envelhecimento prematuro da pele e a uma variedade de problemas dermatológicos”, explica a Dra. Marcella Garcez.\n5. Abacate Rico em ácidos graxos essenciais e vitaminas , como as do complexo E, o abacate ajuda a hidratar e nutrir profundamente a pele, deixando-a macia e suave. Quando aplicado nos cabelos, atua como um excelente condicionador natural, deixando os fios mais brilhantes, macios e maleáveis.\nContinua depois da publicidade\n6. Brócolis O brócolis é um alimento incrivelmente nutritivo, repleto de vitaminas e minerais que beneficiam tanto a saúde da pele quanto dos cabelos. A vitamina A, por exemplo, promove a renovação celular e ajuda a manter a pele saudável. A vitamina E e o selênio protegem os folículos capilares dos danos dos radicais livres, promovendo cabelos mais fortes e bonitos.\n7. Oleaginosas As oleaginosas, como nozes, amêndoas e castanhas, são verdadeiros tesouros quando se trata da saúde da pele e dos cabelos. Esses alimentos são ricos em ácidos graxos essenciais, como ômega 3 e 6, além de vitaminas, minerais e antioxidantes, como vitamina E, zinco e selênio, que fortalecem os cabelos, auxiliam na produção de colágeno e protegem a pele dos radicais livres.\nSegundo a nutricionista Daniela Medeiro, consumir oleaginosas cruas ou torradas é o mais recomendado. Deve-se evitar comprar castanhas com sal, amendoins com casquinhas crocantes ou amêndoas com cobertura doce. Lembre-se que quanto mais natural, melhor será para a sua saúde.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nConsulte um especialista É importante destacar que nenhum desses alimentos isoladamente pode ser usado como fórmula mágica para manter a saúde da pele e dos cabelos. Por isso, é sempre recomendado buscar o auxílio de um profissional para uma orientação individualizada, como explica a nutricionista Nádia Neves. “Para obter o efeito desejado, eles [alimentos] devem fazer parte de uma dieta equilibrada e ajustada à necessidade de cada indivíduo”, conclui a especialista.\nDestaques do NSC Total Terapeuta é confundida com catarinense bilionária mais jovem do mundo e viraliza na internet BBB 24: Beatriz faz biquíni com cascas de banana, toma punição gravíssima e leva casa para Tá Com Nada Enquete BBB 24: Eliminação de brother evidencia favoritismo de adversário Primeiro paciente do mundo a receber rim de porco em transplante deixa hospital nos EUA FOTOS: Mansão que foi de Harrison Ford e de CEO do Snapchat está à venda por R$ 100 milhões Canelinha recebe etapa do Campeonato Brasileiro de Motocross",

    "text": "Man celebrates last day at work after 48 years at Hy-Vee\nClick here for updates on this story\nWEST DES MOINES, Iowa (\nKCCI) — It’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around. But after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and the boss insisted on the special ride to work.\nOutside the store, a display celebrating his years of service.\n“That’s amazing,” Mick said.\nInside the store, family, friends, and former colleagues were waiting to celebrate him.\nCountless hugs and congratulations shows the impact Steve had on the community and his long-time coworkers.\n“He’s the same person today. Extremely nice, thoughtful. Willing to help the customers,” Marilyn Cook, a long-time colleague, said.\n“He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” Kerri Driscoll, Mick’s daughter, said.\nSince 1975 when he was 16, Steve worked behind the meat counter and worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career. His last is the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway.\n“It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul and it’s been well worth it.”\nAs the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at his party is a hint of what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family.\n“I’m going to let life happen to me. Enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said.\nWhen the day’s over, it’s time to trade the uniform for a new one: the retirement shirt.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "Bipartisan conservation poll shows increasing concern over environmental issues in Western States An annual bipartisan survey on conservation in Western states found an increase in voter concerns over climate issues from land and water use to wildlife populations and wildfires. [The 14th annual Conservation in the West Poll](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/stateoftherockies/conservationinthewest/2024.html) from the Colorado College State of the Rockies Project said anxieties regarding many environmental topics had reached new highs. “Issues that are the highest in 14 years of conducting this survey,” said Lori Weigel, one of the project’s pollsters. “They are at the highest levels of concern ever.” The poll contacted people online or by phone, with at least 400 voters in each of the eight Mountain West states — Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. [Weigel](https://newbridgestrategy.com/our-approach) is a Colorado-based Republican pollster and conducts the survey with Democratic pollster [Dave Metz](https://fm3research.com/team/david-metz/), who lives in California. Issues that saw increased concern included climate change, wildlife habitats, water supplies, pollution, and loss of natural areas. Overall, 85 percent of Western voters said a candidate’s focus on conservation issues was important in deciding whether to support the candidate. For 37 percent of voters, conservation issues were the primary factor in their choice of who to support. “What’s striking here is both the breadth and the intensity of support,” Metz said. In one example, nearly 80 percent of voters said more emphasis should be put on protecting migration routes—for species like elk or pronghorn—than on “economically productive” uses of those lands, such as new home developments, roads, or oil and gas production. “There may be a lot that divides voters across the country, but in the West, there is nearly universal consensus in favor of conservation,” Katrina Miller-Stevens, Director of the State of the Rockies Project, said in a press release on the survey. However, that does not mean there were no partisan or state-specific differences in voter’s level of support for certain issues. For example, 60 percent of Colorado voters rated the loss of fish and wildlife habitat as “Extremely Serious” or “Very Serious.” In Wyoming — far more sparsely populated and conservative — that total was 48 percent. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 76 percent of Arizona voters were similarly concerned about inadequate water supplies, compared to 37 percent of Wyoming voters and 46 percent of voters in Montana. However, 53 percent of Wyoming voters were seriously worried about their children not spending enough time outdoors, versus 49 percent of Colorado respondents. The pollsters also “over-sampled” underrepresented groups, like Black and Native American voters. Maite Arce, President and CEO of the Hispanic Access Foundation, said those communities often bear a disproportionate brunt of environmental hazards and often live in areas with less availability of wild lands. Polling results show minority groups have conservation worries that extend beyond environmental concerns. “[These issues] are integral to their health, mental health, jobs, local economies,” Arce said. “These elements also play a pivotal role in preserving culture and heritage.” Besides being shared publicly, the polling data is used throughout the year by Colorado College students in their research. Weigel and Metz also travel to Washington D.C. most years to discuss their findings with members of Congress. There was one bright spot the pollsters found in this year’s results. Voters appeared to be looking more intently for news and information on conservation issues, through podcasts, traditional news sources, and other means. Metz said voters also showed more optimism and thought many conservation problems were solvable, even as their worries grew. “When we ask questions about some of these challenges that we’re facing …people think we can figure it out,” Metz said. “They think there are paths forward.” Editor's note: Colorado Public Radio partners with Colorado College to operate KRCC.
