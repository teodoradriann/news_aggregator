    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — Federal prosecutors say the wife and brother-in-law of a high-ranking member of Palm Beach County law enforcement defrauded Medicare out of more than $9 million . If convicted, they could spend up to 55 years in federal prison. Ted Albin and Erin Foley, South Florida twins and owners of a medical billing company, are accused of conspiring with clients to bill insurers for medical equipment their patients didn't need. In addition to the multimillion dollar payout from insurers, investigators say the twins earned kickbacks for helping others commit fraud, too. Foley's husband, Randy Foley, leads the Behavioral Services Division at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office . He was not named in the 14-page indictment and has not been charged with a crime. His wife and brother-and-law were indicted in December after investigators identified the siblings' West Palm Beach company, Grapevine Professional Services Inc., as one of several across the country believed to have exploited the federal insurance program. “Medicare is a valuable taxpayer-funded program, designed to provide affordable health care to people over 65 or with disabilities,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in the wake of their arrest. “Not to line the pockets of those who would enrich themselves through fraud.\" ' Spine crime': Patients say Lake Worth-area back doctor did 'fake surgeries,' left them in pain Investigators say a network of medical equipment companies provided the twins with sham prescriptions for durable medical equipment, or DME, between 2018 and 2021. DME includes braces, wheelchairs, oxygen equipment and other medical supplies. The indictment does not name the people who wrote the bogus prescriptions but said Albin and Foley knew of their illegitimate origins and used them to bill insurance companies anyway. The twins owned several medical equipment companies themselves and are accused of funneling their own illegally purchased prescriptions into Grapevine's mix as well. Investigators believe the pair also charged a fee to connect associates who wanted in on the scam with people willing to sign off on the phony prescriptions. Foley, 46, of Loxahatchee and Albin, 46, of Stuart were charged in the Southern District of New York with conspiring to commit, and actually committing, health care fraud and wire fraud, as well as conspiring to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Foley's court-appointed defense attorney, Jeffrey Pittell, declined to comment on the allegations Thursday. Albin's attorney, Sean Maher, did not immediately return requests for comment. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Teri Barbera said Capt. Randy Foley is a \"highly respected member of PBSO and is not implicated in these yet-to-be proven allegations.\" She declined to comment further.

Criminals use simple techniques such as phishing to manipulate people into giving up their usernames and passwords. This can lead to major assets being compromised or stolen. Unfortunately, criminals know that many individuals reuse the same passwords or variations of the same password across many sites. Criminals use this information to test stolen passwords on other sites, which can be done on a massive scale. Such attacks can become life-threatening and destructive to many companies and individuals.\nRecommended Citation\nLarson, Jaiden\n(2024)\n\"The Dark Truth about Cyber Security,\"\nMarriott Student Review: Vol. 7:\nIss.\n2, Article 3.\nAvailable at:\nhttps://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/marriottstudentreview/vol7/iss2/3\nMarriott Student Review is a student journal created and published as a project for the Writing for Business Communications course at Brigham Young University (BYU).

    "text": "- The 38-year-old former international was shot six times by an unknown attacker Former Bolivian international footballer Sergio Jáuregui has been shot dead in cold blood while playing a friendly match in Mexico. The 38-year-old former international was shot six times by an unknown attacker at approximately 11 a.m. local time on Sunday during a friendly match in the Santa Inés neighborhood of Cuautla, Morelos. Defender Jáuregui had reportedly left the field to rehydrate on the bench for a brief moment during the game when a gunman approached him and shot his unsuspecting victim at point-blank range. It is said that the shooter fled the scene on a motorcycle that was waiting for him at the entrance to the field, leaving the soccer player mortally wounded. myEmergency services and ambulances rushed to the scene, but were unable to save the affected player, who died almost immediately. Images shared on social media showed a forensic investigation unit heading out into the field as they combed the scene for possible evidence. Bolivian footballer Sergio Jáuregui shot during friendly match Footage shared on social media showed a forensic investigation unit taking to the field as they combed the scene for possible evidence. Atlético de San Luis Rey, a team with which Jáuregui had an important career as a player, expressed its pain through a moving statement on its official Facebook page. ‘We regret the death of our former player and captain Sergio Jáuregui, who defended the colors of our team in the last Torneo de los Soles. We send our deepest condolences to his family,’ the heartfelt message said. ‘We appreciate how you defended our shield and left everything on the field game after game. Therefore, we will always carry you in our badge and heart. Many thanks to the ”Eternal Captain of Cuautla”, the message concluded. Jáuregui played most of his professional career in Bolivia, save for a brief move to Swiss top flight Yverdon-Sport FC in 2005, which lasted only a few months. He played about 13 international matches for his national team, but retired from professional sport in 2015, according to Diario AS, at just 30 years old. It is said that the shooter fled the scene on a motorcycle that was waiting for him at the entrance to the field, leaving the soccer player mortally wounded (results of the shooting in the photo). Jáuregui continued to positively impact the sport after his retirement from top-flight football, taking on a new role as an ambassador by participating in several “semi-professional” teams while dedicating himself to engaging young people in grassroots football. He ingratiated himself on the Mexican soccer scene with Club Deportivo Cuautla, also known as ‘Arroceros de Cuautla’, for several seasons. His commitment to promoting soccer talent was manifested in the opening of a youth soccer school, according to the respected Mexican media La Afificación de Milenio. Meanwhile, police are trying to determine the identity of the gunman and establish a motive for the cold-blooded murder.",

    "text": "For individuals aspiring to obtain an Indian visa, the Indian Online Visa platform offers detailed guidance on required documentation and eligibility criteria. Armed with this information, applicants can efficiently navigate the visa application process, ensuring a swift and straightforward journey to India. The platform facilitates a seamless exploration of India’s rich cultural heritage, historical landmarks, picturesque landscapes, and vibrant traditions, allowing travelers to embark on a journey that promises a fulfilling and immersive experience.\nIndia is often perceived as an exotic travel destination, offering a rich and diverse culture that promises to leave visitors with a tapestry of intriguing memories. International travelers considering a visit to India as tourists are fortunate, as the process has been streamlined for their convenience. The Government of India now offers an electronic Visa (e-Visa) designed specifically for tourists, making the application process more accessible by allowing online applications, as opposed to the traditional paper Visa application at the Indian Embassy in their respective countries.\nIn the era of globalization and the growing trend of outsourcing to India, it has become common for numerous individuals to journey to the country for business purposes and conferences. For those with impending business trips to India who may be feeling uneasy about the uncertainties that often accompany visits to a foreign land, they can find reassurance in the following practical tips and advice.\nBefore their arrival, there are essential logistical considerations to address. By adequately preparing for their stay in India and heeding specific recommendations, travelers can ensure a successful business trip and a pleasant experience in a country that, while often associated with stereotypes, is, in reality, known for its warmth and hospitality.\nFor individuals seeking medical treatment abroad, the intricacies of obtaining a visa should be the least of their concerns, particularly in urgent situations where immediate medical attention is imperative. The prospect of visiting the embassy of the host country to secure a visa for medical treatment can be a daunting hurdle in such circumstances. Fortunately, the Indian government has extended a significant helping hand by introducing an electronic or e-visa tailored specifically for international visitors seeking medical care within India. This development allows individuals to streamline the application process by applying for their Medical Visa for India online, eliminating the need to personally visit the local Indian Embassy in their home country to facilitate their visit to India for medical purposes.\nApplying for a 5-year Indian Tourist Visa becomes convenient as the government offers the option of an e-tourist visa for 5 years. This allows foreign nationals to apply for a visa without physically visiting an Embassy. The acquisition of an India e-Tourist Visa (eVisa India or Indian Visa Online) is essential for experiencing incredible destinations and attractions as a foreign tourist. Whether traveling on an India e-Business Visa with plans for recreation and sightseeing in northern India and the Himalayan foothills, the Indian Immigration Authority recommends the hassle-free process of applying for an Indian Visa Online (India e-Visa), eliminating the need to visit the Indian Consulate or Embassy.\nIntroduced by the government in September 2019, the 5-year Indian Tourist Visa caters to foreign nationals desiring continuous trips to India. Valid for an extended 5-year period, the visa allows a maximum stay of 90 days per visit, with the flexibility of multiple entries. In a calendar year, a foreign national can enjoy a maximum stay of 180 days under the 5-year Indian Tourist Visa.\nWhen a standard application is submitted, the usual processing time for an Indian visa is three days, and it is delivered via email. However, it is advisable to apply for the visa several weeks in advance of the planned departure to avoid any last-minute complications. In situations where time constraints or unforeseen circumstances arise, individuals can still apply for a visa at the eleventh hour using the emergency application method.\nDiffering from other visas such as the Indian Tourist Visa, Indian Business Visa, and Indian Medical Visa, the Emergency Visa to India or Emergency Indian eTA application requires significantly less preparation time. Travel purposes such as sightseeing, visiting a friend, or dealing with complex relationships do not qualify for an Indian crisis visa, necessitating the application for alternative visas. One notable feature of the emergency Indian e-visa application is its processing even on weekends to accommodate individuals with urgent or unforeseen circumstances requiring immediate travel to India.\nFor urgent and immediate requirements, individuals can request an Emergency Visa for India at https://www.India-visa-online.org. Such urgent situations may include a family member’s death, a personal or close relative’s illness, or a court appearance. To expedite the processing of the emergency visa for visiting India, an urgent processing fee must be paid, which does not apply to Tourist, Business, Medical, Conference, and Medical Attendant Indian Visas. Through this service, individuals can obtain an Emergency Indian Visa Online (visa India) in as little as 24 hours, providing a suitable solution for those with time constraints or last-minute travel plans to India requiring an immediate visa.\nThe Indian Medical Attendant E-Visa is a special kind of Indian E-Visa that permits the caretakers of a patient from a foreign country to accompany them on their trip to India where the patient will gain the finest Medical assistance and support from the finest medical professionals and experts in the field. The caregivers who will be allowed to enter India with the patient who holds the Indian Medical E-Visa can be the relatives of the patient, friends of the patient, nurses of the patient, helpers of the patient, etc. The Indian Medical Attendant E-Visa is closely associated with the Indian Medical E-Visa of the patient.\nThe nationals of foreign nations who do not hold the Indian passport, or who are not permanent residents of India will need to have an Indian E-Visa which is associated with the purpose for which they wish to enter and reside in the country temporarily. In this case, the purpose of the visit of the traveler is medical purposes. Thus, the traveler who is entering the country for medical purposes should apply for an Indian Medical E-Visa. This way they will be able to fulfill all their medical purposes in the best way possible with a valid Visa.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name:\nINDIAN EVISA Official Government Immigration Visa Application Online\nContact Person: Mary Windham Caitlin\nEmail:\nSend Email\nCountry: India\nWebsite:\nindia-visa-online.org/visa/",
