    "text": "Google just added a new customization tool for AI viral podcasts in your NotebookLM software. I got early access and tried it using Franz Kafka. The metamorphosis as source material, spending a few hours generating podcasts about the seminal novel, some of them crazier than others.\nLaunched by Google Labs in 2023 as an experimental writing tool focused on artificial intelligence, NotebookLM has enjoyed a resurgence of user interest since early September, when developers added an option to generate podcast conversations between two AI voices (one male and one female) from uploaded documents. While these audio “deep dives” can be used for study and productivity, many of the viral clips online focused on the entertainment factor of asking host robots to discuss strange or very personal original documents, such as a LinkedIn profile .\nRaiza Martin, who leads the NotebookLM team within Google Labs, is excited to give users more control over the content of these synthetic podcasts. “It’s the number one feature we’ve heard people request,” he says. “They want to provide a little feedback on what the deep dive is focused on.” According to Martin, this is the first update of many to come.\nApproaching the first anniversary of his full release NotebookLM is also dropping the “experimental” label, a sign that it’s not headed toward perpetual google cemetery of abandoned software, or at least for now. Martin says this label was removed because the team met internal milestones for overall quality, user retention, and interface standards. It also says that users can now expect a higher level of software stability.\nHow to customize AI podcasts To create an AI podcast using NotebookLM, open the Google Labs website and start a New notebook . Then, add any source documents you want to use for the audio output. These can be anything from files on your computer to YouTube links.\nThen, by clicking on the notebook guide You will now see the option to generate a deep dive, as well as the option to customize it first. Choose Personalize and add your message about how you would like the AI ​​podcast to come out. The software suggests that you consider which sections of the sources you would like to highlight, broader themes you want to explore further, or different audiences you want the message to reach.\nOne tip Martin shares for trying out the new feature is to output the audio overview unchanged, and while listening to this first version, write down any burning questions you have or topics you want to expand on. Then, use these notes as a launching pad to create your NotebookLM prompts and regenerate that AI podcast with your interests in mind.\nMy first impressions I uploaded an 80-page file of Kafka’s famous work of existential literature (in it, the main character wakes up one morning and discovers that he has turned into a gigantic insect) to see how the customization will work for NotebookLM users. The first audio overview it generated, without quick customization, was a solid, if broad, overview of what happens in the novel, as well as a discussion of its key themes. Nothing innovative, but decent.\nThinking as a college nerd studying English, which I definitely was, my first quick adjustment was to have the podcast discussion focus more on the themes of alienation and pervasive bureaucracy found in the book. With an extra push, this result from NotebookLM did an admirable job of focusing on these reasons and generating a discussion that sounded similar to what I had heard before in college classrooms. It was a little meandering, but totally listenable.",

    "title": "‘The Sympathizer’ Opens a Counteroffensive on Vietnam War Movies",
    "text": "HBO has long defined itself in contrast to mainstream television — “It’s not TV,” as the slogan goes — but in many ways its history is one of revising and responding to the movies. “The Sopranos” updated the mafia movie (and its characters quoted, and were influenced by, films like “The Godfather”). “Game of Thrones” dirtied up the high-fantasy genre; “Deadwood” the Western; “Watchmen” the superhero story.\nBut the network has never given us its longform version of, or rebuttal to, one Hollywood staple: the Vietnam War movie (unless one counts the alternative history aspects of “Watchmen”). Until now, with “The Sympathizer,” Park Chan-wook’s kinetic and darkly hilarious adaptation (with the co-showrunner Don McKellar) of the novel by the Vietnamese American author Viet Thanh Nguyen.\nThe seven-episode series is many things. It’s an exploration of dual identity: The protagonist, known only as the Captain (\nHoa Xuande), is a half-French, half-Vietnamese communist double agent planted as an aide to the General (Toan Le), a leader of the South Vietnamese secret police. It’s a spy thriller, a satire of colonialism and its many faces — many of them Robert Downey Jr.’s — and an exploration of the complications of love and memory.\nBut it’s also an intense dialogue and argument with the movies. It is simultaneously its own Vietnam War movie, bold, inventive and sometimes bloody, as well as a pointed, detailed work of movie criticism.\nIn “The Sympathizer,” which began airing in April, the movies are a continuation of war by other means. Its fixation on film begins early. Retelling his story in a postwar re-education camp — the framing device for the series — the Captain recalls watching the vicious interrogation of a communist agent on the stage of a movie theater, where the marquee sign for “Emmanuelle” is coming down, and the one for Charles Bronson’s “Death Wish” is hoisted into place. Even in Hollywood’s dream vision, beauty gives way to an American pointing an oversized gun.\n“Hollywood” is a metonym for America in “The Sympathizer”; it is the country’s front door, its export and its weapon. The Captain’s C.I.A. contact, Claude (Downey), lectures his “protégé” (who he is unaware is a communist) about American pop culture, expounding to him about the Isley Brothers and the Herbie Hancock score for “Death Wish.” Later, Claude tells him about the C.I.A.’s interest in keeping tabs on film directors: “As long as we can keep them within the nebulous bounds of humanism but with no actionable political ideology, they’re completely harmless.”\nFor Nguyen, who came to the United States with his family in 1975, the movies were potent and personal. “I grew up when America was fighting its war in Vietnam all over again, this time onscreen,”\nhe recalled in a 2022 commencement speech. “Vietnam was our country and this was our war, and yet our only place in American movies was to be killed, raped, threatened or rescued.”\nThe adaptation of his novel dramatizes this in its centerpiece fourth episode, which premiered Sunday. The Captain, sent to America after the war to keep an eye on the General in exile, is hired as a consultant for “The Hamlet,” an “Apocalypse Now”–like film by a blowhard American auteur, Nikos, again played by Downey. (Downey also plays an academic peddling theories about the “Oriental” mind-set and a right-wing politician who displays a photo of himself with John Wayne, whose\n“The Green Berets” tried to rouse support for the war.)\nThe filming takes the Captain into 1970s Hollywood’s heart of dimness. Nikos proclaims that he’s making “The Hamlet” to give voice to the Vietnamese people’s pain, but he neglects to give his Vietnamese characters any dialogue. When he agrees to add lines for them, he runs into the small problem that none of the extras hired to play the villagers are Vietnamese or speak the language.\n(The multiple casting of Downey, by the way, is arguably a visual riff on this history of the movies treating Asians in general, and Vietnamese in particular, as interchangeable: Every aspect of imperialism, it conveys, is the same face in different makeup. But in a series that’s meant to foreground the Vietnamese in their own story, the device is showy and distracting because … well, it’s a whole lot of Robert Downey Jrs.)\nThe Captain volunteers to solve the problem, rounding up a group of Vietnamese expats to fill the extra roles, including his friend Bon (Fred Nguyen Khan), who proves to have a talent for getting killed, repeatedly, in a variety of costumes and makeup.\nBut the Captain’s solution introduces its own complications. His refugee extras, who fled the communists, don’t want to play Viet Cong onscreen. “Why do we make art,” the Captain pleads with them, “if not to explore the full complexity of life?” His speech doesn’t persuade anyone, but an offer of an extra $10 in pay does.\nPark, the director of the relentless and sanguinary\n“Oldboy,” is an apt fit for this story, able to both render the thrill of actual action and satirize the absurdity of action moviemaking. (Park and McKellar wrote the fourth episode, which is directed by Fernando Meirelles.) On set, the Captain meets a Korean American actor (played by John Cho), whose résumé includes characters of multiple Asian ethnicities who have been beaten to death by Robert Mitchum, stabbed by Ernest Borgnine and shot by Frank Sinatra. An overbearing method actor (David Duchovny) plays his role as a war criminal with disturbing fidelity.\nThe episode builds to the movie-within-a-show’s climax, the rape of a village woman whom Nikos has named for the Captain’s mother. Though Nikos considers it a “tribute,” the Captain is appalled. (“You should be thanking me!” Nikos complains.) It’s too much for the Captain, whom Xuande plays as a man expert at mastering his emotions and his affect. He is fired and breaks up the scene’s shooting, and while leaving the set, he’s injured in a pyrotechnic blast meant to simulate an airstrike against the Vietnamese hamlet.\nThe Captain survives the devastation of his country only to be blown up by the simulacrum of the war he escaped. But Nikos gets the explosions he needs, and “The Hamlet” is released into the world.\n“This movie is trash,” a Vietnamese character later says philosophically, “but that’s only from our perspective. He’s an American, and from an American perspective, it’s pretty progressive.”\nThis theme — perspectives and the lenses that express and determine them — is what makes “The Sympathizer” both an ingenious critique of war movies and an inventive war story of its own. The series opens with a statement displayed onscreen: “All wars are fought twice / The first time on the battlefield / the second time in memory.” Sly and passionate, “The Sympathizer” joins this battle on a third front: in the pictures.\nThe post\n ‘The Sympathizer’ Opens a Counteroffensive on Vietnam War Movies appeared first on New York Times.",

    "text": "SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Not a single drop of rain fell in Santiago or Chile's metropolitan region this July for the first time since records have been kept. Alicia Moya, a meteorologist for Chile's government, said that multiple meteorological stations across the metropolitan region had registered zero millimeters of precipitation and others around the country had registered record-low readings. \"This hasn't happened since the 1950s, which is when we have records,\" Moya said, adding that the \"abnormally dry\" July is unusual during the austral winter. Chile has been suffering a devastating drought for more than a decade and while heavy rains in June brought some relief to drought-hit lakes, the dry July is a sign that drier conditions are likely to persist. Raul Cordero, a climatologist at the University of Santiago, says that historically Santiago sees at least 50 millimeters (2 inches) of rain in July and any month under 1 millimeter (0.04 inch) is \"extraordinary.\" Cordero said the city registered less than 1 millimeter in 2021, adding climate change and chances of La Nina weather phenomenon increase the chances of extraordinarily dry months. \"Unfortunately we're going to have more dry Julys, without precipitation, sooner rather than later,\" Cordero said.

    "text": "‘We’ll be ready’: MDOT prepared for threat of icy road conditions JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - With well below-freezing temperatures and the threat of freezing rain on the horizon next week for central and northern Mississippi, driving on the road won’t be easy. Monday and Tuesday are First Alert Weather Days for the higher half of the state, which means that you need to take extra precautions if you decide to hit the road. Fortunately, the Mississippi Department of Transportation is already taking steps to make sure the roads you’ll be on are safe. “The plan is to start pretreating roads sometime tomorrow, mostly north of Highway 82, and some areas of central Mississippi just to get those roads ready and prevent any kind of icing from forming that could come our way,” said David Kenney, Spokesperson for MDOT. Although Mississippi doesn’t typically see many severe winter weather threats each year, Kenney says MDOT has invested in even more winter-ready equipment. “We feel we have increased our number of operating equipment for winter weather events. In the last two years,” said Kenney. While MDOT is taking all the necessary precautions on their end, the responsibility of driving safely on the road still comes down to you. Even with a holiday weekend ahead, Kenney advises that you don’t get on the road Monday evening if you can avoid it. “If you don’t have to get out and there is wintry precipitation falling, please stay at home. It’ll just keep you safer, and oh, keep more space for our crews who are out there working to do their thing,” said Kenney. If you do find yourself on the road Monday and Tuesday, he offered advice on what to do if you encounter icy conditions. “Don’t apply the brakes heavily if you do have to brake, apply them easily, so you don’t skid, and avoid all distractions. Put the cell phone down. No texting and driving because some of the roadways could be hazardous to drive on,” said Kenney. To make sure you’re up to date on any changes to next week’s forecast, please continue to tune in to WLBT for all the latest developments for these First Alert Weather Days.

    "text": "Ciudad de México — Petróleos Mexicanos, la empresa estatal conocida como Pemex, reportó una fuga de petróleo crudo que llegó desde infraestructura marina hasta la costa de Tabasco desde el sábado 3 de mayo.\nLa petrolera dirigida por Víctor Rodríguez Padilla dijo en un comunicado que atendió dos fugas en un ducto que transporta aceite de la plataforma marina Akal-C, ubicada en el Golfo de México, a la terminal marítima de Dos Bocas.\nLa compañía detectó que una parte del aceite derramado por la fuga llegó a la costa de la terminal marítima Dos Bocas en el municipio de Paraíso en una extensión de siete kilómetros, mientras personal y equipo especializado de Pemex realiza la limpieza, la cual se espera que concluya en las próximas horas.\n“En dichas acciones se ha dialogado con las comunidades de pescadores para establecer medidas de prevención para que realicen su actividad productiva a la brevedad”, agregó la empresa mexicana en el mensaje.\nEl Gobierno estatal de Tabasco interpuso ante la autoridad reguladora Agencia de Seguridad, Energía y Ambiente (ASEA) una denuncia correspondiente con el folio PROM 00598 con el objetivo de que haya justicia ambiental ante los efectos del derrame del hidrocarburo, el sábado 3 de mayo cuando tuvo conocimiento del derrame, detalló la autoridad estatal en un comunicado.\n“Nuestra postura es pedirle a quien resulte responsable, en este caso, sabemos que Petróleos Mexicanos actúa como primer respondiente; falta determinar si realmente es sobre una instalación que dependa de ellos, al parecer, hay probabilidades muy certeras que así lo sea. Y nuestra intención es el daño ecológico que esto puede generar”, dijo la titular de la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible de Tabasco, Sheila Guadalupe Cadena Nieto durante una inspección en la zona.\nPemex notificó a ASEA con el objetivo de implementar acciones de remediación que correspondan, sin detallar si hubo sanciones.\nASEA señaló en un comunicado el 5 de mayo que realizará una supervisión a Pemex para que informe las causas del derrame, la cantidad de hidrocarburo derramado y las acciones para remediarlo.\nLa petrolera mexicana enfrenta problemas operativos y de producción petrolera, la cual ha caído más de 10% en el último año ante adeudos multimillonarios a proveedores y contratistas, además del declive de sus principales activos Maloob, Zaap y yacimientos nuevos como Quesqui.\nVer más: Pemex reporta más pérdidas durante 2024 por costos de deuda e impuestos\nEl Ayuntamiento del municipio de Paraíso informó el domingo 4 de mayo que se colocó bandera negra, lo que significa que el acceso al mar no está permitido.\nLas autoridades locales señalaron que estaban en coordinación con Pemex para la limpieza y retiro de aceite que afectó sus playas, incluida Playa Sol, a través de sus redes sociales.\nBloomberg Línea consultó a Pemex por el volumen de crudo derramado por la fuga pero no obtuvo respuesta.\nPemex es la petrolera más endeudada del mundo con pasivos financieros por US$101.100 millones con una producción petrolera de 1,6 millones de barriles diarios.\nEsta historia se actualizó a las 20:00 horas a lo largo del texto con información sobre el derrame, una denuncia del estado de Tabasco y la respuesta del regulador ambiental.",

    "text": "[El plan del Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (AyA) para proveer de agua potable a unas 638.000](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/infraestructura/aya-deja-fuera-de-plan-de-inversiones-urgentes-a/VVHGHJAK6NCZBOCL4LLATMA524/story/) personas está de “prioridad número uno” entre los proyectos de la entidad que carecen de financiamiento″. La afirmación la hizo este jueves Mariana Fernández Sing, directora de la Unidad Ejecutora AYA-BCIE, ante los diputados de la Comisión para el Control de Ingreso y Gasto Públicos. Ese proyecto clave sin financiamiento es Orosi II, el cual tenía disponible $399 millones para obras que iban a llevar el líquido a 15 cantones de San José, Heredia y Cartago, fondos que se perdieron porque el AyA dejó vencer el plazo que dio el Banco Centroamericano de Integración Económica (BCIE) para dar el préstamo. El crédito fue aprobado en noviembre del 2020, momento a partir del cual Costa Rica tenía dos años para formalizarlo; ese plazo venció en noviembre de 2022. De hecho, Orosi II quedó fuera de la lista de [proyectos urgentes para los próximos dos ](https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/salud/es-imposible-garantizar-el-agua-277-afirma-jerarca/36YRJHVOKVDUXDAPHNT5YTZ4AI/story/)años, como reconoció el AyA en mayo anterior. Cuando Orosi II quedó excluido de esa lista, Juan Manuel Quesada Espinoza, presidente ejecutivo del AyA, informó de que la idea ahora era sacar 70 licitaciones para desarrollar 45 proyectos “de alta prioridad” por una inversión estimada en $564 millones entre todos. Sin embargo, conforme el relato de Fernández Sing en el Congreso, Orosi II ocupa el primer puesto entre las obras prioritarias que no tienen financiamiento. La diputada Sofía Guillén Pérez, del Partido Frente Amplio, solicitó a la ingeniera aclarar esa nomenclatura y le recordó que el Proyecto de Abastecimiento para el Acueducto Metropolitano Quinta Etapa (PAAM), conocido como Orosí II, fue excluido del listado de prioridades.

Francisco Nicolás Alvarado, de Liberación Nacional (PLN, cuestionó el nivel de urgencia brindado por el AyA para concretar Orosi II, justo por carecer de dinero para ejecutarlo frente a otras iniciativas con fondos. El congresista le preguntó si el Instituto ya inició contactos con entidades bancarias para conseguir el dinero. La ingeniera respondió negativamente porque, según explicó, desde el año pasado se inició un proceso para actualizar el estudio de factibilidad de Orosi II. Como parte de esa acción, AyA remitió al Ministerio de Planificación Nacional y Política Económica (Mideplan) el documento ya actualizado. Sin embargo, este les fue devuelto con una serie de observaciones y oportunidades de mejora. Sin el visto bueno del Mideplan, agregó Fernández Sing, el Instituto no puede empezar a tocar la puerta de bancos u otros financistas. Según la ingeniera, a finales de este mes remitirán otra vez el estudio de factibilidad luego de subsanar los puntos anotados por Mideplan y así obtener el visto bueno de esa cartera. Con ese aval, el AyA podrá salir a buscar dinero para construir Orosi II, explicó la funcionaria.",
