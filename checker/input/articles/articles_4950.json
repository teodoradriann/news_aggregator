    "text": "In the history of Team USA men’s basketball, there hasn’t been much sniping or in-fighting when it comes to the Olympics and the actual competition. Most of the drama happens beforehand, when the roster is being put together.\nBy the time the team is all together, it’s usually all gravy on the way to the gold medal.\nThe 2024 version of the Olympic squad has been a little different.\nFirst, there was the controversy surrounding the exit of Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard and the addition of his replacement, Boston Celtics guard Derrick White , instead of his teammate and NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown .\nNow, it’s Philadelphia 76ers center and first-time Olympian Joel Embiid and his comments to The New York Times Magazine criticizing the age and skill of some of his teammates — particularly LeBron James — on Team USA that drew a rebuke from one of the senior members of the team.\n“You look at the talent that the U.S. has, but there’s equal talent on other teams,” Embiid said. “And the talent that’s on the U.S. team, you also got to understand most of those guys are older. The LeBron now is not the LeBron that was a couple of years ago. So it’s a big difference. Everybody would also tell you, and you can see for yourself, the athletic LeBron, dominant that he was a couple of years ago, is not the same that he is now. I think people get fooled by the names on paper. But those names have been built throughout their career, and now they’re older. They’re not what they used to be.”\nSeven players on Team USA’s roster are 30 years old or older, including Embiid, with James the oldest at 39 years old. James, who is trying for his third Olympic gold medal, led Team USA in points (14.8) and assists (3.6) through exhibition play.\nJames also almost single-handedly saved Team USA from two defeats in exhibition play, rallying them from late deficits against South Sudan and Germany.",

    "text": "O presidente argentino, Javier Milei, cancelou uma viagem à Itália para a cúpula do G-7 na próxima semana e desistiu de uma reunião agendada com o presidente francês Emmanuel Macron, de acordo com pessoas com conhecimento de seus planos.\nEstava programado que Milei participasse do G-7 depois de receber um convite da primeira-ministra italiana, Giorgia Meloni, e deveria ter conversas bilaterais com Macron, em Paris, em 19 de junho. A mudança no cronograma, no entanto, ocorreu antes de um momento crucial para seu amplo pacote de reformas pró-mercado no Senado argentino, onde parlamentares da oposição ameaçaram retirar várias disposições importantes em uma votação na próxima semana.\nSeja um dos primeiros a garantir ingressos para a NFL no Brasil com a XP. Pré-venda exclusiva com Cartão XP, aprovado em 24h!\nAs negociações em curso sobre o pacote de reformas contribuíram para que Milei cancelasse a visita com Macron, de acordo com uma pessoa familiarizada com o assunto, que pediu anonimato para discutir a situação. Milei agora pretende iniciar sua turnê europeia em 21 de junho, para participar de cerimônias de premiação na Espanha e na Alemanha.\nO atraso na partida alterará significativamente o escopo da viagem. Na Itália, o argentino estava prestes a cruzar com um de seus principais adversários políticos — o presidente do Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — pela primeira vez desde que assumiu o cargo. Ele teria ido ao país também para se encontrar com o Papa Francisco, com quem Milei reconciliou-se depois que os dois trocaram farpas durante a campanha presidencial da Argentina.\nAs novas datas de viagem de Milei também colocam em risco sua participação na cúpula da Ucrânia na Suíça, onde o presidente Volodymyr Zelenskiy deve apresentar um plano para a paz para a guerra em curso contra a Rússia.\nO pacote de reformas de Milei, dividido entre dois projetos de lei, foi aprovado na Câmara dos Deputados da Argentina em abril, mas agora enfrenta novos desafios no Senado. Os legisladores estão tentando retirar disposições que reintroduziriam o imposto de renda e privatizariam empresas estatais, duas medidas destinadas a ajudar o governo a fechar uma lacuna crônica de gastos.\nEm vez disso, Milei retornará a Madri, que visitou no mês passado, para receber um prêmio de um instituto libertário no cassino da cidade, de acordo com o site da organização. Milei também receberá um prêmio da Sociedade Hayek, em Hamburgo, em 22 de junho, seguido de uma reunião com o chanceler alemão Olaf Scholz.\nA última viagem de Milei a Madri, onde discursou em um comício de extrema direita por um partido de oposição, desencadeou uma briga diplomática total com o primeiro-ministro espanhol, Pedro Sánchez.\n© 2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Almost half of the yards the Bengals defense allowed in their 34-11 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers came on three plays, but the story of the team's defensive woes this season have primarily come from allowing big plays and defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo knows that has to stop for the season to continue into the playoffs. The Bengals (8-7) play at the Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) at 4:25 p.m. this Sunday mired in a battle with three other 8-7 teams for the final AFC Wild Card playoff berth. In the loss to the Steelers, the Bengals allowed three receptions to wide receiver George Pickens to account for 196 of their 397 yards of total offense with two of those receptions going for touchdowns. \"At this point of the season I don't want to make excuses for anything, but we can't win a football game if we give up 200 yards on three plays,\" said Anarumo. \"We are what we are right now. These things have to stop in order for us to be a consistent defense. These are things that have not shown up in a long, long time, but they've shown up this year. So whatever the reasons are, we will keep working at it like we're doing, but they can't continue. We got balls going over our heads. We got missed tackles on slants, those are the reasons.\" The missed tackle on the slant came on Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph's first pass of the game. Pickens made a move to get inside rookie cornerback DJ Turner and second-year safety Dax Hill, who is in his first year as a starter at that position, took bad a angle to try and tackle Pickens and not only missed, but knocked Turner down in the process. [The end result was an 86-yard touchdown.](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1738676470703161730) \"So you look at that play and let's just start with DJ,\" said Anarumo . \"DJ's got to do a better job of getting his hands on the receiver and then if the guy catches it, tackle him before it ever gets to Dax. But as the post safety or the single high safety in that defense, or any single high defense in the world, the number one thing that those guys are being taught is that they take the proper inside out angle to the ball and don't overrun it. That's what happened. He overran it, knocked off DJ and there you go. It's a critical error at a critical time, but it's a learning lesson, a tough one to take. They practice that stuff. It's not like he doesn't practice it, but it's just a little bit different when it's full speed.\" Not only is Hill in his first season as a starter at safety and Turner is a rookie, but the other starting safety for the last few games, Jordan Battle, is also a rookie. There is little doubt that inexperience has factored into some of the big plays allowed this season. \"I just think that some of it is still lessons that these guys are learning and we will be better for it in the future,\" said Anarumo. \"I keep saying that, but unfortunately in the future is like today and we have to get better at these things immediately. We try to stay calm and settle them down on the sideline and just keep fighting, playing with the technique that the coaches are teaching you. They want to be good. They're great listeners, they're very willing participants. Our guys, it's just a matter of just tightening it down on every little detail of what their jobs are and we've got to get better, which includes myself.\" While there are certainly growing pains for a chunk of the secondary, the other two long pass completions to Pickens came on a go route and a fade route against veteran Chidobe Awuzie. The first one covered 44 yards to set up a field goal before halftime, and the [ other went for a 66-yard touchdown early in the third quarter ](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1738701799551365383)after the Bengals had closed to within 24-8. Awuzie was having a stellar 2022 season before suffering a season-ending knee injury at Cleveland in the game No. 8, and he clearly hasn't returned to that form this season. He wouldn't put the blame on his issues against Pittsburgh being the knee, but he did point the finger at himself for allowing those plays. \"That’s something that, in the beginning of the year, maybe, but now I’m feeling good. I’m feeling confident,\" said Awuzie. \"My rhythm is back, I can’t look at ‘Oh, it’s my knee.’ Nah. I’m gonna be a man about it.'” He admitted to [getting too greedy on the 44-yard completion. ](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1738693451619705244) “I was just trying to do too much,” Awuzie said. “Down what we were down, I was trying to sit at the sticks when I shouldn’t have. I know I have to be over top. Put that one on me. Put the game on me. I didn’t play to my standard. I didn’t play to our defensive standard. It’s not on the coaches. It’s not on anybody else except the player. It’s on me. All I can do is look at in the face, deal with it and move on and try to be better.” Anarumo said Awuzie shouldn't blame himself for the loss. \"Here's a super accountable guy on a lot of levels, so it's not been an easy year for him just because of coming off the injury and not getting in the rhythm that he wants to,\" said Anarumo. \"It's hard as a corner if you're not out there play in and play out and just getting a feel for the game, getting a feel for the guy you're covering, how he's running things and just because of the rehab didn't probably allow him to do that early. He's feeling better now, so I still would never count him out.\" Awuzie was rotating with Turner for many games this season, but moved back into the starting lineup full time when Cam Taylor-Britt suffered an ankle injury the week of the first meeting with Pittsburgh on Nov. 26 and then placed on injured reserve, which cost him the next four games. He was designated for return on Wednesday and deemed himself ready to play this week after participating in Wednesday's practice. \"He's played a ton of ball so hopefully he'll be able to get right back out there and pick up where he left off, I'm hoping,\" said Anarumo. Taylor-Britt's return would be a huge boost, but it also may relegate Awuzie back into a rotational role with Turner. \"I'll kind to see how the week goes there on that to be honest,\" said Anarumo. \"When you're in these type of situations, it's all hands on deck, so whatever gives us the best opportunity this week we'll do.\"",

    "title": "UAE to recruit agri workers to increase farm production, cut imports - The Hindu BusinessLine",
    "text": "With the United Arab Emirates (UAE) aspiring to produce 50 per cent of the food it consumes locally by 2051, it could begin recruiting agricultural workers from India mainly in view of the good bilateral relations between New Delhi and Abu Dhabi. Currently, most of its food demand is met through imports.\nThe Gulf kingdom is one of the most affected countries by the global wave of food shortage. In 2018, it launched its National Food Security Strategy to ensure access to sufficient amounts of food for all citizens.\nSamuel Joy, Founder & CEO of Huntr “The UAE government made its intentions to bring agricultural workers into the Kingdom a couple of weeks ago. But specifications on the sort of personnel to be hired have not been issued yet,” said Samuel Joy, Founder & CEO of Huntr, a migrant worker marketplace.\nEmulating Israel According to him, the UAE is looking to emulate Israel, which has converted desert into “farming paradise”. “Israel has become self-sufficient in its own food production and it is exporting to European countries,” he said.\nTo start with, the UAE could recruit 20,000 such workers this year and in the long-term the requirement could be two lakh. “The UAE government has brought in scientists from Israel to work on soil fertility. Billions of dollars have been invested in farming,” Joy said.\nAt the I2U2 (India, Israel, UAE and the US) Summit in September 2023, the group focused on ensuring food security in each nation and looked at developing clean energy.\nArable land in the Emirates “The US and Israeli private sectors will be invited to lend their expertise and offer innovative solutions that contribute to the project’s overall sustainability. These investments will help maximise crop yields and, in turn, help tackle food insecurity in South Asia and the Middle East,” the group said in a statement.\nAccording to the World Bank, only 0.5 per cent of the UAE’s land is arable. It has decreased by 3 per cent annually due to desertification and soil degradation. It also experiences water scarcity as groundwater is quickly depleting.\nThe largest facets of the UAE’s agritech sector include 36 per cent (indoor farming), 15.9 per cent (precision agriculture), and 15 per cent (agri inputs), according to the report titled ‘AgriTech in the UAE Industry Landscape Q3 2022.’\nAround 65 per cent of the nation’s agritech companies are micro-sized enterprises with fewer than 50 employees.\nJob requirements Joy said recruiting firms such as Huntr will look for agricultural workers whose English speaking ability will be up to “a certain level”. “But in terms of requirements, they must understand the soil and agriculture,” he said.\nA recent advertisement to recruit agricultural workers for the UAE among other things said they should have previous experience in agricultural practices and techniques. They should be able to operate farm tools and equipment and should possess a high school diploma or equivalent.\nBut Joy said farmers, once they land in the UAE, will be provided training in new technologies, machinery, equipment and farming in desert lands. “They will work with scientists on vertical and hydroponic farming. We may recruit agriculture specialists too but not scientists,” said Joy.\nThe UAE may be looking to grow corn (maize) first. The kingdom is already experimenting with growing corn and vegetables. “There is a green farm spread over 200 hectares in Sharjah Maliha desert, which is a red one,” the Huntr founder and CEO said.\nDubai’s largest vertical farm Emirates Airlines, on the other hand, in collaboration with Crop One Holdings, has unveiled Dubai’s world’s largest vertical farm. “The new facility, the $40 million-Bustanica, is a 330,000 square-foot space - nearly the size of 6 football grounds- growing crops like kale, spinach, and mixed greens,” he said.\nBustanica has the potential to produce over 1,000 tonnes of high-quality, organic greens annually. It leverages AI to help grow food without the use of soil. Human contact with plants is limited to decrease the chances of contamination. Instead, digital methods are used to collect valuable data and control operations.\nThe recruited agricultural workers may be provided pre-departure training in English, the UAE culture and understanding the job, he said.\n“For the UAE, agricultre workers will be recruited from all across India,” said Joy.",

    "text": "Thousands of Pakistanis protested against the Supreme Court's top judge on February 23, after he issued a ruling related to blasphemy that sparked online backlash and thinly veiled death threats. A campaign targeting Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa began after he ordered the release of a man from the Ahmadi religious sect, considered heretical by hardline Muslim scholars. The man had been accused of disseminating a forbidden Ahmadi text, which firebrand clerics consider tantamount to blasphemy — an incendiary issue in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where even unproven allegations of offending Islam have sparked violence. Around 3,000 people gathered at rallies across the northwestern city of Peshawar after Friday prayers. Crowds blocked roads and chanted \"Death to Qadianis\" — a slur referring to Ahmadis — as well as \"Long live Islam\". The Supreme Court issued a statement on Thursday evening defending his ruling, denying that it went against the Islamic constitution of Pakistan. \"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" it said. \"The organised campaign against judiciary and judges is unfortunate.\" A spokesman for Pakistan's Ahmadi community, Amir Mahmood, told AFP that \"one-sided negative propaganda is being spread against this judgement\" which protected a man from \"being persecuted for his religious belief\". Chief Justice Isa's ruling first went unnoticed two weeks ago, before it was highlighted by social media accounts linked to the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party behind violent anti-blasphemy protests. Posts calling for him to resign have been shared thousands of times on social media. The Pakistani chapter of the Taliban militant group — known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — called Chief Justice Isa \"an enemy of Islam\" and \"a damned man\". Damned for their faith The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said Chief Justice Isa's ruling \"protects the constitutional right of all religious minorities to freedom of religion or belief\". \"Those political leaders and sections of the media that are responsible for this campaign must be restrained,\" the organisation said on social media platform X. Ahmadis have been discriminated against and persecuted for decades in Pakistan, because of their belief in a 19th century prophet after Muhammad. The second amendment of Pakistan's constitution, made in 1974, declares Ahmadis non-Muslims. The law also prohibits them from professing to be Muslims or spreading their faith, and allows the death penalty for those found guilty of insulting Islam. In his judgement, Chief Justice Isa ruled that according to the constitution, \"every citizen shall have the right to profess, practice and propagate his religion\". \"Freedom of faith is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam. But sadly, in matters of religion, tempers flare up and the Qur'anic mandate is forsaken,\" he added. He also said the book allegedly disseminated by the accused had not been outlawed at the time of the alleged crime in 2019. Cleric Fazlur Rehman, the influential leader of the conservative religious party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, said Chief Justice Isa's reasoning was \"false and based on bad intentions\". In 2011, the governor of eastern Punjab province was killed by his bodyguard after calling for reforms to the stringent blasphemy laws that Ahmadis frequently fall foul of.",

    "title": "New Law Mandates Hearing Aid Coverage for Minors in Virginia",
    "text": "A new law in Virginia requiring health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and corporations to provide health care coverage subscription contracts for coverage of hearing aids and related services for anyone 18 years of age or younger will go into effect at the start of 2024. According to the [legislation](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1003)—which passed in February 2023—coverage includes one hearing aid per ear, up to a cost of $1,500, every 24 months when an otolaryngologist recommends such hearing aids and related services. “I am honored to have worked alongside my co-sponsor, Senator Spruill, to introduce this bill,” said Senator Bill DeSteph (R-Virginia Beach) when the bill was initially passed in February. “Hearing loss can have a significant impact on a child’s development, and we believe that every child in Virginia deserves access to affordable hearing aids. With this new law, we are taking a significant step towards ensuring that all children in Virginia can receive the healthcare they need.” Further reading: [Illinois Senator Passes Law to Ensure Consumer Protections for Hearing Aid Returns](https://hearingreview.com/inside-hearing/legislation/illinois-senator-passes-law-to-ensure-consumer-protections-for-hearing-aid-returns) The legislation aims to provide families of hearing-challenged children to not worry about the high costs of hearing aids, according to a relase from the Senate of Virginia. The bill prohibits the State Corporation Commission from using any special fund revenues dedicated to the Commission’s other functions and duties, including revenues from utility consumer taxes or fees from licensees regulated by the Commission or fees paid to the office of the clerk of the Commission, to fund the defrayal of costs for the coverage provided as required by federal law.
