    "title": "Forget blood tests - this Israeli company is betting on saliva",
    "text": "Dr. Guy Krief wants to improve health care accessibility and enable early detection and monitoring of certain diseases and conditions, and he is using saliva to do it.\nThe co-founder and deputy CEO of Salignostics says that making saliva a viable diagnostic medium is crucial as personalized, at-home health care becomes increasingly essential.\nKrief explains that traditional diagnostics often rely on blood, urine or tissue samples, which can be invasive, expensive and time-consuming, while saliva-based diagnostics are non-invasive, cost-effective and user-friendly. In addition, they offer the potential for at-home and point-of-care testing.\nThe technology used by his company, Krief explains, \"addresses the challenge of saliva’s low biomarker concentration, making it a reliable alternative for detecting a wide range of diseases—from pregnancy to infectious diseases and even cancer.\"\nSalignostics was founded in 2017 in Jerusalem by a team of five researchers from the Hebrew University specializing in saliva research. \"We recognized the untapped potential of saliva for diagnostics, but its biological complexity posed challenges. Our breakthrough was developing a patented technology that made saliva-based diagnostics as reliable as traditional blood tests—without the invasiveness, cost and logistical issues.,\" Krief told Ynetnews.\nKrief's role at Salignostics centers on shaping commercial strategy, forging key partnerships, and securing investments. His expertise spans the field of saliva-based diagnostics, and he has led efforts to scale innovative medical technologies on a global scale.\nHe says that Israel's biotech success lies in the fact that the country, home to world-class academic institutions like the Hebrew University and Weizmann Institute, has a strong culture of innovation and where \"questioning the status quo is encouraged.\" In addition, he cites the government and military R&D programs that nurture skilled entrepreneurs.\nKrief says that the success in closing global deals he and his team at Salignostics managed stems from \"a combination of scientific credibility, strategic partnerships, and market insight.\"\nAmong the ways that this was achieved, he says, was proving the company's technology through successful products like Salistick, the first saliva-based pregnancy test with CE, UKCA, and TGA approvals, allowing them to be sold in EU countries and Australia. In addition, the company leveraged its proprietary saliva-processing platform, which enables novel clinical applications like saliva-based pancreatic cancer detection.\nThe company also implemented the \"Salignostics Inside\" model, which allows other diagnostic companies to integrate its technology into their products, expanding market reach and accelerating adoption.\nAs part of this success, Salignostics was featured in Time Magazine in October 2023, which presented its Salistick as one of the 200 best inventions of 2023.\n\"Time Magazine featured us because our saliva-based diagnostics represent a transformative shift in health care,\" Krief explains. \"Our technology allows for non-invasive, user-friendly self-testing, aligning with the growing trend of home-based health care. Time recognized the potential of our innovation to make advanced diagnostics as intuitive as checking one’s temperature, validating the broader vision of accessible, at-home diagnostics.\"\nIt has not all been smooth sailing, however, and Krief acknowledges that \"scaling a biotech company comes with its challenges.\nThese challenges include: Navigating complex regulatory approvals across various global markets; Educating the market on the reliability of saliva-based diagnostics; and Ensuring manufacturing scalability without compromising quality.\nHe adds that \"balancing scientific innovation with commercialization has been an ongoing challenge, requiring continuous refinement of our product pipeline and partnerships to meet both consumer and regulatory demands.\"\nKrief and Salignostics have learned some valuable lessons along the way. One of those lessons is to not underestimate regulatory timelines, which delayed the company's entry into the market. In addition, the company faced some early-stage production challenges as it scaled manufacturing to meet demand.\nThe company also invested heavily in its COVID product, SaliCov, which didn't achieve high sales due to the end of the pandemic and the influx of low-cost nasal swab tests.\n\"Despite these setbacks, we gained invaluable insights that helped us refine our core technology and better position ourselves for future success,\" Krief says.\nKrief says there are some important trends to pay attention to in the world of biotech, many of which are taking off in Israeli biotech companies.\nPersonalized medicine and diagnostics are key going forward, and his company is meeting this challenge. \"Saliva-based tests are a key enabler of personalized health care, offering at-home monitoring and early disease detection,\" he explains.\n'Technology should address a clear market need, ensuring it’s not just innovative but also practical and impactful'\nAnother popular trend is digitalization and connected health care. Integrating home diagnostics with telemedicine is crucial for future health care solutions, according to Krief. At the same time, he explains, Precision diagnostics, particularly for cancer treatment, are becoming increasingly important. In addition, combining diagnostics with pharmaceutical care to allow real-time monitoring and therapy adjustments is crucial.\nGet the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play:\nhttps://bit.ly/4eJ37pE| Apple App Store:https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNvKrief has advice for an entrepreneur who is starting a tech company today. First, he says, the start-up should focus on solving a real, meaningful problem. \"Technology should address a clear market need, ensuring it’s not just innovative but also practical and impactful,\" he explains.\nHe cautions the entrepreneur not to start business development before he or she has solid technology. \"It’s critical to have a reliable product or solution before pursuing partnerships or customers. Premature business development can lead to misalignment and wasted resources,\" he warns.\nAt the same time, he says, \"don’t be afraid to target a 'dreamy' product that could change the entire market. Aim for disruptive innovations that have the potential to reshape industries. Also, target multi-billion-dollar markets where your solution can have a widespread impact.\"\nIn addition, hire the best consultants and subcontractors you can afford for core issues like regulatory, intellectual property, accounting and legal, he says.",

    "title": "Mark Carney would be 'outstanding' addition to federal politics, Trudeau says",
    "text": "OTTAWA — Mark Carney would be an \"outstanding addition\" to federal politics, the prime minister said Thursday, in response to speculation that he is trying to recruit the former Bank of Canada governor to join his cabinet. Trudeau was asked about the possibility of replacing Chrystia Freeland by making Carney his new finance minister during a press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. Rather than deny the possibility, Trudeau praised Carney and said he's been talking to him about joining federal politics for years. \"I think he would be an outstanding addition at a time when Canadians need good people to step up in politics,\" Trudeau said. But he also emphasized that he has full confidence in Freeland. \"In regards to Chrystia, she has been a close friend and ally and partner in doing really big things for Canada and will continue to be,\" he said. In French, Trudeau said he was \"always open\" to having other people join the party. A source in the Prime Minister's Office, who spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the suggestion that Trudeau is thinking about replacing Freeland with Carney is \"totally false.\" The idea of Carney running for the Liberals has been a constant discussion in Canadian political circles for years, and he himself has not ruled out the possibility of one day seeking the Liberal leadership. Speculation about a role for Carney, either in the Liberal cabinet or at the helm of it, has run rampant since the Liberals lost a long-held seat in a Toronto byelection last month. Most thought the seat would be a safe one for the Liberals, and the loss sparked calls for Trudeau's resignation from within and outside the party. Despite the criticism, Trudeau has pledged to lead the Liberals into the next election. Carney's supporters see him as a strong economic candidate, as the Liberals struggle to address the growing expense of basic needs in Canada and defend against criticism about government spending. Conservatives have already taken aim at Carney, and even called for him to appear at a parliamentary committee in April so they could grill him about his plans for government economic and fiscal policy.

La Liga MX pierde el Juego de Estrellas 2025\nEl equipo de figuras de la Major League Soccer toma revancha y gana 3-1 el partido para quedarse con todo el motÃn tras conquistar tambiÃ©n el Skills Challenge\nLa Liga MX no pudo repetir la dosis y la MLS tomÃ³ revancha de lo sucedido el aÃ±o pasado, para llevarse el triunfo 3-1 en el Juego de Estrellas 2025, celebrado en el Q2 Stadium de Austin, Texas.\nLas figuras del fÃºtbol mexicano se quedaron cortas en esta nueva ediciÃ³n del All-Star Game, pues tambiÃ©n fueron derrotados en el Skills Challenge y se mostraron lejos de llevarse el triunfo en el duelo.\nLa primera mitad del Juego de Estrellas entre la Liga MX y la MLS tuvo algunas jugadas de peligro en ambas porterÃas. Luis MalagÃ³n salvÃ³ en dos ocasiones consecutivas el arco de la Liga MX: un tiro libre y una volea, ambos de Evander. Mientras que Sergio Canales generÃ³ peligro para la Liga MX con un disparo que obligÃ³ a Brad Stuver a intervenir.

    "title": "Amid scorching heat, Moore’s order lays foundation for efficient, clean cooling",
    "text": "By Sarah Kogel-Smucker ,\n5 hours ago A man cools off in a Manhattan fountain in June, as excessive heat has gripped the East Coast this summer. The weather is just another reason to applaud Maryland's zero-emission HVAC standards. Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images\nThe first day of summer in Maryland came with a warning : Code Red—Extreme Heat.\nAcross the state — from the panhandle to Montgomery County to the Eastern Shore – residents endured temperatures above 90°F. This heat wave caused more than 1,600 emergency room visits in one day throughout the mid-Atlantic. Since then, the Washington metro area has endured weeks more of temperatures above 90°F, peaking at 104 degrees in both D.C. and Baltimore.\nThe record-breaking heat shows that we must prepare now for the extreme conditions caused by climate change, especially as EPA analysis shows that heat waves are occurring longer and more frequently than before.\nFortunately, the first step toward universal clean cooling was taken when Gov. Wes Moore signed a visionary executive order ordering the Maryland Department of the Environment to develop zero-emission heating equipment standards (ZEHES) this year. The directive will ensure that all new HVAC systems in Maryland will soon be heat pumps, delivering highly efficient heating and cooling.\nHeat pumps are an essential component of any strategy to make homes more resilient to extreme heat. Heat pumps use 18% less electricity compared to central air conditioning, providing lifesaving cooling amid peak summer heat at a lower cost. Upgrading to a heat pump could save families $705 per year on average on their utility bill, with a further $350 in savings when residents upgrade to a heat pump for water heating.\nFor low-income households who spend six times as much of their annual income on energy bills as Marylanders as a whole, these energy-saving heat pumps could offer financial relief.\nThe governor’s executive order does not impact existing heating equipment. Instead, after a date certain new systems would have to employ efficient heat pumps. This gives Maryland residents and businesses time to plan ahead toward their next HVAC system and the option to stack new rebates from EmPOWER Maryland along with federal rebates and incentives. It also sends a clear signal to contractors, installers, retailers and manufacturers to prepare today for higher demand for heat pumps.\nThese newly available rebates and incentives are important for underserved communities. The passage of HB 864 unlocks new state-level funding for heat pumps and helps low-income families, including those living in multifamily housing, to access whole-home retrofits and electrification.\nMontgomery County has lead the way through its Healthy, Efficient, Electrified, Climate-Adapted Pilot (HEECAP), which funds competitively selected community partners to reduce emissions, provide gap funding for health and safety repairs and offer climate adaptations for low- and moderate-income homes, including the installation of heat pumps. The county’s Building Energy Performance Standards will encourage heat pump adoption in larger buildings. Maryland policymakers must work with counties and local stakeholders to ensure that these rebates and incentives are easy to navigate, saving people time and money.\nThe efficient heating equipment also addresses Maryland’s poor air quality. Fossil fuel heating equipment emits nitrogen oxides (NOx), a key ingredient of ozone pollution or smog. Replacing fossil fuel equipment in homes with cleaner electric technologies will bring urgent relief to Marylanders, particularly low-income and communities of color, who have had to shoulder many of the health and economic costs of this air pollution.\nIn 2017 alone, outdoor building pollution caused an estimated 163 premature deaths . Pollution from fossil fuel equipment in the Baltimore region is responsible for 3,500 cases of respiratory symptoms, 6,500 lost days at work and $1.3 billion in health impacts annually.\nDespite the health impacts of fossil fuels, Maryland residents have subsidized for-profit methane gas companies for decades, artificially lowering the cost of fossil fuel heating equipment. This profitable status quo benefits shareholders while propping up an aging, sprawling gas pipeline that will soon become obsolete.\nGov. Moore’s executive order, however, charts a better path forward, one that is not beholden to the gas industry’s interests and recognizes the writing on the wall: a move to healthier, more efficient electric equipment. Highly efficient heat pumps are already proving to be a cost-effective and popular choice among Marylanders, with 54% of households on track to adopt the technology by 2030.\nAt a time when Maryland residents are enduring scorching heat, we can’t rely on inefficient AC systems and fossil fuels to bring relief. Instead, we must invest in cleaner, healthier homes with highly efficient heat pumps.\nGov. Moore’s executive order lays the foundation to do just that.\nThe post Amid scorching heat, Moore’s order lays foundation for efficient, clean cooling appeared first on Maryland Matters .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Also, the narrow and dilapidated roads leading to the yards hinder our ability to meet international standards,\" he said while briefing three advisers of the interim. Industrial Adviser Adilur Rahman Khan, Land Adviser Advocate Hasan Arif, and Industries Secretary Zakia Sultana visited the Arab Ship Recycling Yard at Sonaishari with a view to assessing the shipbreaking industry's challenges and exploring its growth potential. \"The industry contributes $100 million annually through exports of various metals and components, boosting several local sectors including steel, rerolling, shipbuilding, aluminium, and furniture,\" Zahirul said. Industries Secretary Zakia Sultana acknowledged the need for stronger regulations, stating, \"Although rules have been made, a law for the shipbreaking industry is essential. The government will consider long-term funding if a formal request is made.\" She also mentioned that discussions have already taken place regarding the development of connecting roads, with plans to involve LGED or CDAK in the project. Additionally, she confirmed that a study is underway for the construction of the treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) at Mirsarai Industrial City, with JICA funding. After the briefing, the delegation visited the yard to witness the ongoing development activities firsthand.",

    "text": "SNOQUALMIE PASS, Wash. – A man who fell nearly 500 feet down a ravine was rescued on Sunday by a Kittitas County Search and Rescue team, and by dispatchers who helped him make a tourniquet out of his helmet straps. According to the Kittitas County Sheriff’s Office, at about 11:39 a.m. on July 6, their 911 dispatch received a 911 text that just read “HELP.” The KCSO said dispatchers worked for an hour and a half to communicate with the 51-year-old Seattle man who had sent the text, and learned he had fallen into a deep ravine along No Name Creek while mountain biking in the area of Little Kachess Lake. Deputies said the man had suffered a debilitating injury in the fall, and was bleeding heavily. KCSO deputies said the man told dispatch he wasn’t able to get to his supplies from where he had fallen, and he appeared to be slipping in and out of consciousness. He sent messages to share with his wife and family if he didn’t survive. KCSO said dispatchers were able to guide the man through fabricating a tourniquet using the straps of his bicycle helmet. While dispatch was on the phone with the man, Kittitas Search and Rescue teams were on the way to him. However, it was determined that it would take a rope team hours to reach the man, and he needed assistance much sooner. A helicopter from the King County Sheriff’s Office was flown out to the area and hoisted the man to safety. He was taken to Harborview Hospital in Seattle to be treated for his injuries. KCSO officials thanked search and rescue personnel for coming out on the holiday weekend to help, and the King County Sheriff’s Office for sending a helicopter to help out in the steep terrain. ​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY APPLE VALLEY NEWS NOW.
