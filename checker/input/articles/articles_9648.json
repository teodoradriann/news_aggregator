    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "郭继舜\n◎记者 孙小程\n4月1日，在“智启人形·聚势未来”上证·长三角科创沙龙上， 均普智能 人工智能与人形 机器人 研究院院长兼首席科学家郭继舜表示，大模型让人们看到了人工智能与人类智慧比肩的可能性，机器人将把人工智能和大模型的能力实体化，进而演化为具身智能。\n智能机器人，也有望成为继智能手机和智能汽车后，人类普遍拥有的第三个智能设备。\n在郭继舜看来，人形机器人主要用于应对两大关键问题：一是老龄化加剧，随着医疗进步、生活改善，人类预期寿命增长，社会老龄化问题会日益突出；二是劳动力短缺，尤其是在高强度重复劳动领域，劳动力缺口渐显。\n“在实际应用层面，人形机器人的能力确实有待提升。但我们往往会高估一项技术短期内的作用，却低估其长期的影响。未来5到10年，我们会看到人形机器人对生活的切实改变。”郭继舜说。\n不过，现阶段人形机器人行业面临的最大问题是：卖给谁、谁在用？哪种人形机器人能在场景中放量？\n对此，郭继舜表示，未来2到3年，看好工业应用中仓储和生产两个场景，原因在于，这两个场景比较结构化、高频，同时也更容易落地；未来3到5年，部分人形机器人有望在公共服务场景落地，比如商场导购、营业员、医院导诊等；5到10年后，在医疗、护理、养老等领域，个性化的人形机器人产品实现场景落地。\n基于自身积累，作为均普智能的母公司,均胜集团近年来积极布局机器人产业。汽车供应链企业布局人形机器人的优势在于，团队可以将智能驾驶里的控制器、感知规划、决策算法等技术，迁移至机器人领域。汽车技术是相对要求更高的车规，当这些技术迁移至工规领域时，可以让人形机器人的量产标准化程度更高，并推进降本和产业协同。\n郭继舜介绍，人形机器人行业从上游核心零部件、中游生产制造集成，一路延伸至下游应用场景落地。其中，均普智能主要是基于生产制造的领域去做场景落地，进而整合供应链、生态链，通过为合作伙伴提供硬件以及必要的代工业务，推动整个行业的发展。\n“长远来看，我们的目标是，用人形机器人制造人形机器人，这就是所谓的‘奇点临近’，我相信这个时间点会很快到来。”郭继舜说。",

    "text": "(Alliance News) - Offshore wind turbines in the North Sea will power around 12,000 Vodafone Group PLC cellular network towers across Germany under a new deal that the mobile provider struck with German energy firm RWE AG.\nVodafone, a Berkshire, England-based telecommunications company, operates a total of about 26,000 towers in Germany.\nThe offshore wind farm, named Kaskasi, is to supply a total of 250 gigawatt hours per year beginning in 2026, the two companies announced in Dusseldorf on Friday. The electricity supply contract has a term of 10 years.\nIn return, Vodafone has installed a special offshore mobile radio station at the wind farm, which is located about 35 kilometres north of the German North Sea island of Helgoland, which will connect the technicians on site as well as drones and sensors.\nThe inspection drones would be controlled in real time using the mobile-phone connection in order to detect potential technical faults on the wind turbines at an early stage.\nNetworked human health sensors could also increase the safety of employees on site, the companies said.\n\"We are bringing modern 5G mobile communications to the sea to support the production of wind energy in Germany,\" said Philippe Rogge, who leads Vodafone Germany.\nRWE manager Ulf Kerstin said that Kaskasi is now the sixth RWE wind farm in the German North Sea, with plans for a further cluster of turbines north of the barrier island of Juist that will generate 1.6 gigawatts of power.\nVodafone shares fell 1.2% to 65.80 pence each on Friday morning in London, while RWE shares were 0.9% lower at EUR32.00 each in Frankfurt.\nsource: dpa\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.
