    "text": "EU elections: “D66 represents a belief in the promise of Europe” Gordon Darroch Dual Dutch and Spanish national Raquel García Hermida-van der Walle is number two on the D66 list for the June 6 European parliamentary elections. The EU, she tells Dutch News, offers “amazing freedom”. The European Union has shaped the life of Raquel García Hermida-van der Walle. She was two years old when Spain signed the Treaty of Accession to join the EU in 1986, in her native city of Madrid. Less than 30 years later she moved to Gorredijk, a town of 7,000 people in Friesland, to live with a Dutchman she met in Barcelona. “It’s something we take for granted, but compare it to what you have to do to move outside the European Union in terms of paperwork, visas and permits,” she says. “What an amazing freedom it is to be able to decide: ‘I’ve fallen in love with someone, I want to live and study there’, and you can just pack up your bags and go.” She describes herself as “Spanish by birth, Dutch by choice and European by conviction.” It made her a logical choice to stand for the liberal D66 party in next month’s European parliament elections. When she first came to the Netherlands in 2012 it was to study political science in Utrecht, under the Erasmus scheme. She learned about the Dutch constitutional system, the “poldermodel” of consensus-based policy making and “tolerance policies”. And she followed the election campaign of 2012, where she saw D66 as the party that represented “a firm stand against populism” and “belief in the promise of Europe”. Though she had worked for a human rights organisation in Spain and spent three years in Washington with the Earth Day Network, an environmental campaign group, it took time to orient herself politically in the Netherlands. “For a while I thought it was out of reach,” she says. “But the beauty of Europe is that I could get onto the list for the European Parliament in 2019 because I had the right as an EU citizen to stand in local and European elections.” It inspired her to take Dutch citizenship so she could be “100% a member of this society,” with full voting rights. “I’ve got so much from the European Union,” she says. “My children are a product of the European Union. I do not think I would have moved to the Netherlands if it had not been made possible by our European freedoms.” On course to win a seat As the second-ranked candidate on the D66 list, García Hermida-van der Walle is on course to win a seat at the second attempt. Opinion polls suggest the biggest gains will be made by the populist right-wing parties in the Identity and Democracy (ID) group , which includes Geert Wilders’s PVV. The bloc is expected to win more than 90 seats and could push the liberal Renew group, which includes both D66 and the right-wing VVD, into third place. The European Conservative and Reformists (ECR) group, which includes right-wing nationalist parties such as Poland’s Law and Justice (Pis) and Italian prime minister Georgia Meloni’s party Brothers of Italy, could end up with a similar number. If the ECR group takes in Fidesz, the party of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, after the elections, the Eurosceptic right could have around 200 of the 720 seats in the new parliament. García Hermida-van der Walle is alarmed by the potential ramifications. “We see they want to limit our freedoms,” she says. “They are already saying that we should curtail the freedom of people to live and work in different countries. So for us the message is really clear: if we want to allow people to keep building up their lives in the way we have been doing for the last three decades, we have to ensure that the pro-European parties remain at least as big as they are now.” But on immigration, one of the key battlegrounds in this election, D66 and the VVD are poles apart, despite being partners in the Alliance for Liberals and Democrats in Europe (ALDE). The Vienna Declaration, published last September by the Renew Group, which includes ALDE, calls on parties to reject any form of co-operation with “anti-European” factions . That declaration is incompatible with the VVD’s role in The Hague as a potential coalition partner for Geert Wilders’s PVV party, which wants to close the borders in Europe and for 20 years advocated a Dutch exit from the European Union. No deals with the extreme right It has forced the VVD’s leading MEP, Malik Azmani, to abandon his hopes of chairing the Renew group , but his party can count on little sympathy from their partners in Brussels. “The VVD should think through whether they are complying with what the majority of the parties in ALDE and Renew want,” García Hermida-van der Walle says. “What they do with that is up to them. We feel very comfortable in a political family that has made it clear we do not want deals with the extreme right.” Right-wing parties say freedom of movement has mainly benefited a privileged elite and the priority should be controlling migration. She concedes that the exchange programmes such as Erasmus have been too focused on university students and wants to see it expanded to people in vocational training. “But we shouldn’t forget that a lot of people who are technically skilled work in sectors that are highly dependent on the European Union,” she says. “Maybe not everybody has benefited to the same degree from being able to travel and work in a different country, but when you sit round the kitchen table and ask people: where do you work? Do you export, do you import, do you have colleagues from other countries? Then the conversation shifts and they say: yes, Europe does a lot for me.” Similarly, efforts to limit the number of international students in Europe belies the importance of knowledge workers in an open economy like the Netherlands. “We need the influx of these students because we see that the vacancies in our job market are not being filled,” García Hermida-van der Walle says. Foreign students are not the problem Excluding international students because Dutch students are unable to find a place to live is short-sighted, she argues. “That’s not a problem with the foreign students: it’s a problem with the housing market in the Netherlands. We shouldn’t confuse one problem with the other.” For D66 the challenge is not about keeping migrants out, but how to create safe migration routes and an expanded “blue card” system for third-country skilled workers. “We have a demographic crisis in Europe,” she says. “We are becoming older and older. So if we want to keep moving forward, we need people from abroad. And we need to do that in a humane and rational way.” The other policy area where Europe is likely to change course if voters shift to the right is nature and agriculture. The Green Deal has already been watered down as a concession to farmers who have staged disruptive protests in Brussels and across Europe in recent months. Farmers complain that the extra cost and bureaucracy, coming at a time when they are already struggling to compete with cheap imports from outside the EU, are threatening their livelihoods. The European Commission has abandoned plans to cut pesticide use by 50% by 2030, while nations such as France have promised more financial support. Farming regulation García Hermida-van der Walle sympathises with the farmers’ position, but says delaying reforms to make farming more sustainable will make the problem worse in the long term. “We cannot live without a healthy nature,” she says. “It is deeply related to both climate change and the transition in agriculture. We need to provide our farmers with a different business model so that they can earn a fair income in a more sustainable way that makes all of us healthy and has a lower footprint on the planet.” She agrees the sector suffers from over-regulation, but sees the solution in making the rules stronger rather than weaker. “Especially in the Netherlands, for every rule that came from Brussels we found an exception or a way to adapt it, so we do need a more simplified agricultural policy,” she says. “And because a lot of agriculture is subsidized, there are a lot of market mechanisms that are not really working.” “When consumers buy cheap milk in the Netherlands, they’re paying an artificially low price, but those prices don’t reflect the environmental costs. The biggest margin goes to the supermarkets and the big industries behind fertilisers, for example, or animal feed, or the technologies associated with the expansion of the bio-industry. Strength in connectivity “If you go to a different business model you can produce at lower cost. Consumers may have to pay more in the supermarket, but the farmers get more money and the middle parties get a smaller slice of the cake.” Europe’s strength is its connectivity, she argues: the member states have more power and influence when they make decisions collectively rather than try to fend for themselves. But that connectivity is undermined when leaders use the veto as a bargaining chip to pursue national self-interest. The foot-dragging by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán over a €50bn aid package for Ukraine earlier this year is a case in point. D66 wants to end the right of veto and extend qualified majority voting to most policy areas, which would mean at least four nations would usually be needed to block a decision. “The veto system is the best way for autocrats and wannabe autocrats to ransom the European Union,” she says. “If we want to achieve our ambitions on defence, climate, and the freedoms of the Europeans, the big challenges of this century, we cannot do it within the current legislative framework.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine has forced the EU to take a stronger collective line on defence and security, an area where it has historically been weak. “It is a myth that any single country in the European Union or beyond, with the possible exception of the United States, could defend itself from serious aggression from outside. And that’s not just about traditional warfare, but also cybersecurity,” she says. “European countries spend three times as much as Russia on defence, but Russia is still able to wreak havoc. So we do need to integrate more. It’s not about giving up sovereignty: it’s enhancing and strengthening our sovereignty at a European level.” García Hermida-van der Walle fears that voters are losing sight of the advantages that European co-operation brings. Minimum safety standards “Dutch people go on holiday a lot to Spain, and I tell them: you don’t remember this, but 30 years ago it was almost impossible to travel by road in Spain because the roads were so terrible. “You had to drink bottled water because the water wasn’t considered healthy to drink. And when you bought a toy for your children in the local supermarket, you didn’t really know if it was safe. Now you know, because Europe has minimum safety standards. It’s not what people think about when they go to bed at night, but it makes it very tangible what we have done as a union.” The challenge for pro-European parties, she says, is to make those benefits tangible again. “The European Union is complex by nature, while voters want simplicity in everything. But what I’ve noticed during this campaign is that you make the biggest impact when you sit at a table with someone over a coffee or a beer and you just ask them: what does Europe do for you? What can we do better? If that contact moves them to be a bit more interested in Europe and go and vote on June 6, I think I’ll have done a good job.” Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.

    "title": "Amari Cooper injury update: Browns WR ruled out of 'Thursday Night Football' contest vs. Jets with heel injury | Sporting News United Kingdom",
    "text": "One week after cracking the top-20 greatest single-game receiving performances with his explosion vs. the Texans, Amari Cooper is set to miss out on the action. The Browns star — who tallied up a franchise record 265 yards last weekend — was ruled out of Cleveland's Week 16 contest vs. the Jets on \"Thursday Night Football\" after sustaining a heel injury, according to NFL Network's [Mike Garafolo](https://twitter.com/mikegarafolo/status/1740520075315253550?s=46&t=uqYSnrlrtO-BBz0LWXwF8Q). Cooper is one of Joe Flacco's favorite targets and looked poised for a marquee matchup with New York star Sauce Gardner in the secondary. Kevin Stefanski's side now looks to clinch a postseason berth without its leading receiver, an already formidable task given the Jets' swarming defense. LIVE: [Browns take on Jets as Cleveland looks to clinch playoff berth on 'TNF'](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/jets-browns-live-score-highlights-thursday-night-football/363b8bf15ba889110fff9906) Here's the latest on Cooper's status going forward. Amari Cooper injury update Cooper left Sunday's game vs. Houston with a whole lot in his possession. He posted one of the greatest receiving displays in modern NFL history, joining Tyreek Hill, Antonio Brown and Calvin Johnson as players to have surpassed 260 receiving yards in a single game. That didn't mean he didn't have battle scars, however. The reigning AFC Offensive Player of the Week suffered a heel ailment in last week's clash. After failing to take part in any of Cleveland's three practices this week, Cooper was deemed questionable to play in Thursday's festivities. It seems he attempted to give things a go during warmups. However, the Browns star receiver sensed something wasn't right. He and Cleveland took the sensible approach of waiting until Cooper was closer to fitness to return to the field. For fantasy owners, that's not necessarily a good thing. MORE: [Riley Patterson takes over as Browns kicker with Dustin Hopkins injured](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/browns-kicker-riley-patterson-dustin-hopkins-injury/2cfa2246002299057bf10d72) Cooper, 29, is enjoying the best season of his career, having already surpassed his career-high in receiving yards (1,250). His absence could loom large for Flacco and Co., especially against New York's menacing backline. The Jets are surrendering the seventh-worst completion percentage against opposition quarterbacks in the league as is. Without Cooper, a vertical threat capable of drawing attention deep in the flat, things could get challenging for Flacco on Thursday night. Browns WR depth chart With Cooper away, expect the likes of Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman to be more involved in the passing game. Tight end David Njoku is likely to be a safety valve for Flacco; he's Cleveland's second-leading receiver this year, tallying up 75 catches for 748 yards and six touchdowns so far. Marquise Goodwin, listed as Cooper's official backup on the depth chart, was a limited practice participant throughout the week. He's still slated to play, however.",

    "title": "Giorgia Meloni is wrong about the Islam-Europe compatibility problem. Look at Albania",
    "text": "Giorgia Meloni is wrong about the Islam-Europe compatibility problem. Look at Albania\nAn old video of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni recently resurfaced on social media, reigniting the compatibility debate surrounding Islamic culture and European values. Meloni’s five-year-old assertion that the two aren’t compatible aligns with her views expressed in a foreword written for the ‘First Report on Europe’s Islamisation,’ presented in 2019 by the Farefuturo Foundation think-tank. Meloni expressed concerns about the potential realisation of French novelist Michel Houellebecq’s “prophecy”—of a future France, devoid of Christian meaning, electing a Muslim leader who transforms the nation into a French Islamic theocracy.\nGiven its prime minister’s views, it’s hardly surprising that Italy hasn’t granted legal recognition to Islam and prohibits Muslims from constructing new mosques. The country has signed recognition agreements with 13 religious communities, including Hindus and Jews, but doesn’t legally recognise Muslims in the country.\nWhen we encounter such controversial statements from leaders holding responsible offices, endorsing policies that discriminate against Muslims or impose restrictions on Islam, mere cries of Islamophobia are not enough. The apprehension toward Islam and Muslims has a nuanced history, and finding a solution is difficult without a sincere acknowledgment of the roots of this history.\nWhile we advocate for the recognition of Muslims leading peaceful lives, we must also confront the reality that a section of Muslims adhere to political Islam, posing a genuine threat to democratic values due to their rejection of equality and liberty. It’s essential to recognise that the traditional interpretation of Islam envisions a society where Muslims are the ruling class, and non-Muslims are, at best, tolerated without equal rights. Additionally, this vision includes a State enforcing Islamic values, including the prohibition of blasphemy and policing societal morality, aspects that challenge the essence of European democratic order.\nThe late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had said in 2006, “We have 50 million Muslims in Europe. There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe—without swords, without guns, without conquest—will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.” When leaders from the Muslim world make such declarations, they inadvertently frame Muslims and Islam as threats that seek dominance over Europe, disregarding avenues for peaceful coexistence with the diverse communities in the region.\nThe series of attacks on European soil under the pretext of hurt sentiments and jihad has forced us to recognise radicalism within the Muslim community as a threat. Beyond these incidents, certain individuals within the Muslim community demand the removal of LGBTQ rights or ‘blasphemous’ chapters from school curricula, citing moral objections. This not only raises concerns about accommodating diverse perspectives but also reflects attempts by Islamists to suppress free speech through violence and threats. This poses a significant challenge, as it grants undue authority to extremists in shaping the interpretation of Islam and defining the identity of Muslims. Every Muslim must have the right to define their identity without coercion from such radical elements.\nMuslims fighting radicalism The significant challenge lies in the unfamiliarity and lack of expertise in Europe regarding Islam, and political Islam, and its cultures. State leaders like Meloni either make broad statements or avoid addressing the issue out of fear of being labelled Islamophobic.\nIt’s crucial to raise awareness that the Muslim community is not homogeneous. Even within Islamism, there are diverse perspectives. Islamist groups, like ISIS and al-Qaeda, resort to violence, while others, like Salafists, share political goals but refrain from violent acts. Then there are unorganised individuals who use democracy and the rule of law to advance political Islam. Recognising that ordinary Muslims view Islam as a personal faith and not a comprehensive societal solution is essential for understanding and addressing the complexities within the community.\nIt is disheartening that Meloni and many other world leaders often fail to acknowledge the numerous Muslims in Europe who have wholeheartedly embraced liberal and progressive values, actively combating radicalism.\nOne compelling example is the UK Member of Parliament, Sajid Javid. In 2019, while serving as home secretary, Javid demonstrated his staunch anti-Islamist stance by blocking the return of Shamima Begum, a British-born woman who had joined the Islamic State in Syria and married a Dutch-born fighter. Not only did Javid prevent her re-entry but he also revoked her citizenship, acting on intelligence reports identifying her as a security risk. Javid stood firm in his conviction despite facing backlash from the Left and the Islamist community.\nIn 2015, as the business secretary, Javid underscored his stance against Islamism. He urged British Muslims to challenge non-violent extremists who support the ideologies of the Islamic State. Javid labelled Islamism as an ideology fundamentally at odds with the values of Western liberal democracy—one that has inspired numerous attacks against innocent people. While there are Muslim leaders like Javid, it’s also understandable that without consistent support, trust issues are likely to persist.\nI explored Muslim-majority countries in Europe to understand whether Islamic culture can coexist with European values. Albania, a country in the Balkans, caught my attention. Some might argue that Albania faces more economic challenges compared to other European nations but its government, laws, and society appear to align well with democratic values. The country embraces a multiparty system with legal protection against discrimination toward the LGBTQ community, even though it doesn’t currently recognise same-sex marriages. Albania upholds freedom of speech and doesn’t have stringent laws against ‘blasphemy’. Inter-religious marriages are commonplace, and the nation has a historical record of providing sanctuary to Jewish people during times of persecution in Europe.\nThere’s an argument suggesting that Albania’s progressive-liberal-democratic nature stems from its communist roots. While this may hold, the current reality is that Albania is governed by the Democratic Party, highlighting that a Muslim-majority country can embody both shared and distinct values in harmony with European ideals. The dynamic interplay between history, governance, and cultural influences showcases the nuanced nature of the country’s alignment with democratic principles.\nIn addressing challenges within the Muslim community, let’s remember: There isn’t a singular version of Islam. Acknowledging diverse interpretations is key to seeing Muslims beyond a homogenous bloc.\nAmana Begam Ansari is a columnist, writer, TV News Panelist.

    "text": "TOWSON, Md. — Going for the trifecta.\nTowson Gymnastics are looking to win its third consecutive East Atlantic Gymnastics League (EAGL) championship. They're also recognizing 10 of their gymnasts who made All-EAGL teams.\n\"A lot of these student-athletes put their blood, sweat, and tears into it. So, to see those rewards come back, not just being acknowledged for what they have been doing is great for everyone,\" said head coach Jay Ramirez.\nThe Tigers dominated the 2025 All-EAGL Team awards.\nBeginning with senior Lauren Keener, who was first-team bars and second-team beam.\n\"I was really proud of myself and really excited that I was named too. I definitely like competing beam more just because I feel more calm up there. More nervous for bars, but I like practicing bars better,\" Keener said.\nJoining her is senior Clara Hong, who was first-team in bars, beam, and floor.\n\"Been super gratifying,\" Hong said, \"I feel like this final year, I've done the best that I could. I feel like I'm really thriving and doing the best gymnastics that I've done.\"\nJunior Isabella Minervini also made a tremendous impact this season.\nShe was first team all around, first-team bars as well as second-team beam floor. But the one she's most proud of is finishing first team on the vault.\n\"This is my first year back on vault since I competed in high school and I got first-team on it, which is absolutely crazy. It's not something I would've imagined, but I'm really proud of myself for pushing and being so consistent that I was able to do this well my first year back,\" Minervini said.\nIndividual accolades aside, the Tigers are chasing that coveted third straight EAGL championship this Saturday in Philadelphia.\nSaturday's meet will also have a tremendous impact on if they'll make the tournament for the fifth consecutive year.\n\"I feel like it's just a cherry on top, winning this meet this weekend,\" says Hong.\n\"This team has just been improving every year I've been here and it's just super great to see what this team and what we're capable of,\" says Minervini.\n\"Winning the championship would mean a lot to us. Just as a team to know it's back to back to back,\" says Ramirez.",

    "text": "So this is wild. Simply smelling a cup of coffee can give you the same energy boost as drinking it. Maybe. New research suggests it might.\nDr. Supriya Rao explains in a story posted at Delish.com that certain scents can stimulate the brain and “enhance alertness,” some of them even help us focus and boost our energy. A recent study from Reviva Coffee links five scents to increased energy levels. Smelling these things in the morning could help kickstart your day.\nLemongrass - This scent stimulates both dopamine and serotonin, which can improve your mood, as well as focus and alertness. According to another recent study, just inhaling lemongrass oil improved reaction times. Lemongrass can also decrease brain fog and promote mental clarity.\nCoffee beans - Even if you don’t drink the stuff, just smelling roasted coffee beans can make your brain more alert without ever taking a sip. Functional Nutrition Specialist Jennifer Nicole Bianchini explains, \"The simple act of inhaling the scent of coffee activates the central nervous system and increases alertness by triggering dopamine pathways—our feel good neurotransmitters—in the brain.\"\nPeppermint - Menthol, the active ingredient in peppermint, activates parts of the brain that improve attention span, alertness and learning capacity. It may even help lower the release of cortisol, which helps lower stress.\nOrange - The scent of this citrus is known to instantly boost our mood and improve attention.\nChocolate - It’s not just the taste we love, the scent of chocolate stimulates the reward center in the brain, which causes the release of dopamine, giving us a big boost of happiness. Bianchini says the smell of chocolate can even improve cognitive function, too.\nSee more from Delish.com HERE .",

The funding from the GEF Trust Fund, [Least Developed Countries Fund](https://www.thegef.org/topics/least-developed-countries-fund-ldcf) (LDCF), and [Global Biodiversity Framework Fund](https://www.thegef.org/what-we-do/topics/global-biodiversity-framework-fund) (GBFF), which together are part of the GEF family of funds, reflects a commitment to quickly and efficiently deploy grants to developing countries whose action on environmental challenges is key to meeting global goals for biodiversity, climate change, and pollution this decade. The package of support includes nearly $500 million from the GEF Trust Fund for 25 projects and programs, among them the new global [Sustainable Cities Integrated Program](https://www.thegef.org/projects-operations/projects/11287), and multiple efforts to address chemicals and waste challenges, including in Bolivia’s cement, textile, brick, and glass sectors, in Brazil’s cement industry, and in electronics globally. It also includes support for a new Indonesia Coral Bond that will connect private capital with urgent conservation needs, building on the successful [Wildlife Conservation Bond](https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/blog/new-lifeline-wildlife-conservation-finance), or “rhino bond,” issued by the World Bank in 2022 with GEF financial support. Focusing on climate change adaption, Council members approved a record $203 million from the LDCF for initiatives across 20 Least Developed Countries, including joint financing with the GEF Trust Fund for the [Great Green Wall](https://thegreatgreenwall.org/). The LDCF support will propel efforts to enhance resilience to flooding and drought in Laos and Cambodia; to develop climate-resilient transport infrastructure in Sao Tome and Principe; to support youth- and women-led green enterprises in Chad; to improve food security in Sierra Leone; and to address other urgent needs. The GBFF Council approved the new fund’s very first work program, allocating $37.8 million for protected area management in Brazil and Mexico. This came less than one year after the fund supporting implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework was launched at the [Seventh GEF Assembly](https://assembly.thegef.org/) in Vancouver, Canada. The three GBFF-funded projects are set to improve the sustainability of more than 30 million hectares of protected areas on land and at sea, with long-term financing and support for Indigenous-led conservation.

At a moment where we hear calls for multiple additional financial mechanisms, I strongly believe that we need to come together, not further divide ourselves.” Council members also heard from the heads of multilateral environmental conventions about the need for fast, collaborative, and joined-up action towards international goals, looking ahead to the three year-end Conferences of the Parties (COPs) on biodiversity, climate change, and desertification. The Convention on Biological Diversity’s COP16 will occur in [Colombia in October](https://www.cbd.int/conferences/2024); the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s COP29 will occur in [Azerbaijan in November](https://cop29.az/en); and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification’s COP16 will occur in [Saudi Arabia in December](https://www.unccd.int/cop16). Rolph Payet, Executive Secretary of the [Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants](https://www.pops.int/), stressed the importance of prioritizing action on pollution, including the phase-out of dangerous chemicals, which can cause long-lasting environmental harm with wide effects. “Failure to meet the 2030 targets could lead to continued contamination of ecosystems, adverse health effects in our bodies and in wildlife, and increased difficulty in achieving broader environmental and public health goals,” Payet said. This urgency was echoed by Monika Stankiewicz, Executive Secretary of the [Minamata Convention on Mercury](https://minamataconvention.org/en), who noted that cleaning up industrial processes and improving waste management were key to reducing risks to the environmental overall, and to making progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework as well as targets on carbon emissions and land health. “The needs are vast,” she said. The GEF Council will meet next in December 2024, when countries will begin discussions on the ninth replenishment of the Trust Fund. The four-year GEF-9 funding cycle will stretch from 2026 to 2030 – a period aligned with the final push for 2030 global environmental goals including the “30x30” target. “We are at a moment of truth for the planet. We need to rise to the challenge by assessing what we have, where we need to go, and how we will get there,” Rodríguez said. “The GEF partnership needs to be bigger, bolder, and better. Bigger in our ambitions. Bolder in our actions. And better in our delivery, better in our impact. This is the spirit that I want us to take forward as we enter into the GEF-9 replenishment negotiations.” This press release was originally published by the [Global Environment Facility](https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/press-releases/gef-council-approves-700m-vast-environmental-needs)",
