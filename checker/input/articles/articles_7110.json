    "text": "Este viernes, varios operativos policiales terminaron con la detención de decenas de individuos que pertenecerían a Estado Islámico y que preparaban ataques contra sinagogas e iglesias del país. Las autoridades turcas anunciaron este viernes la detención de 32 sospechosos, presuntos miembros del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico (EI), que se cree que estaban preparando atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias del país. Según una fuente de la seguridad turca consultada por medios locales, estas personas fueron detenidas durante redadas de las fuerzas de seguridad y de los servicios de inteligencia en nueve ciudades, entre ellas Estambul y Ankara, la capital. “Dos de los sospechosos (...) fueron a explorar a sinagogas e iglesias”, afirmó la fuente. Mencionó también a un tercer hombre que planeaba un ataque contra la embajada de Irak. Según esta fuente, los tres sospechosos son importantes miembros del grupo yihadista. La policía turca anunció la semana pasada una gran redada en 32 ciudades del país y la detención de más de 300 personas por presuntos vínculos con el EI. Los ataques a las comunidades judías y cristianas en el país árabe continúan en ascenso y han tenido un incremento notable desde los ataques de Hamás a Israel el pasado 7 de octubre. A propósito de ello, el presidente de Turquía, Recep Erdogan, declaró que no considera que Hamás sea un grupo terrorista y lo tildó de “grupo de liberación”, a la vez que acusó a Israel de atacar Gaza.",

    "text": "VICKSBURG, Miss. by Alyssa Lick ( VDN ) — For Vicksburg native, Erin Lawson, it started with cheesecake-stuffed strawberries during a global pandemic. What began as a simple creative outlet for a bored teenager has transformed into a thriving dessert brand, a forthcoming storefront, and a beacon of inspiration for young entrepreneurs in Vicksburg.\nAt just 21, Lawson is no stranger to hard work. A Warren Central High School graduate, she earned her associate degree by 19 and is now pursuing a business administration degree from Mississippi State University. Lawson describes herself as “mature, driven and wise beyond my years.”\nFrom age 16 to 19, Lawson worked at the local Chick-fil-A, rising through the ranks to become a closing lead before she turned 20.\n“That role taught me leadership, accountability, and how to work in a fast-paced, customer-focused environment,” she said. “Those lessons still guide me today.”\nLawson, like many during 2020, found herself searching for something to occupy the long, isolated evenings after her shifts.\n“I became infatuated with the cheesecake-filled strawberry trend I kept seeing online,” she recalled. “I tried it, and surprisingly, it was a hit right from the start.”\nWhat followed was an unexpected whirlwind. Friends and family started requesting orders, and Lawson’s kitchen became her testing ground.\n“It kind of snowballed from there,” she said. “That was the spark that lit everything.”\nShe named her growing enterprise Punkies, a childhood nickname that carried personal meaning.\n“I wanted my brand to reflect a piece of me,” she said.\nBy mid-2020, she was selling desserts from her family’s home kitchen. Every inch of counter space became part of her production line, and her refrigerator overflowed with strawberries and filling. Eventually, the family moved into a home with a pool house, a game-changer that Lawson transformed into her own mini bakery.\n“It allowed me to separate work from the main house and gave me room to take on more orders,” she said. “That was a big step in helping Punkies feel like a real business.”\nPunkies tent at the City Wide Pep Rally (Photo by Erin Lawson) Lawson’s journey hasn’t been without hurdles. Without a formal business background, she learned everything on the fly, managing orders, navigating burnout, and marketing her brand. At one point, she even left Vicksburg for Nashville, intending to pursue dental hygiene.\n“But while I was there, I realized I wasn’t passionate about it,” she said. “I ended up switching my major to business, came back home, and returned to Punkies with a clearer vision.”\nThat time away offered clarity: baking wasn’t just a hobby, it was her calling.\nFrom the beginning, Lawson’s hometown showed up for her.\n“The support from my community was everything,” she said. “People in Vicksburg were placing orders, sharing my posts, and cheering me on.”\nWord-of-mouth helped her expand rapidly. Holidays like Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day brought in such demand that she once dipped nearly 700 strawberries in 36 hours.\n“That’s when I knew I needed to treat Punkies like a full-on business,” Lawson said.\nShe quickly gained traction, and not just online. Local schools invited her to vendor events, including Alcorn State University, where she became affectionately known as “the cake lady.”\nNow, Punkies is taking its biggest leap yet: opening a storefront. Lawson recently signed a lease for her first retail location, in the former Gumbo Pot building on Halls Ferry Road, just steps from where she once worked at Chick-fil-A.\n“It felt surreal,” she said. “To go from closing shifts there to now opening my own business just steps away… it hit me hard.”\nLawson’s vision for her new storefront is of a dessert lounge: cozy, welcoming, and intentionally different from a traditional bakery. While the Punkies menu will feature the things that have put her on the map, i.e. cheesecake-stuffed strawberries, pudding cups, cookies, and more; Lawson hopes to expand the menu to include light food options and dessert wines.\n“This won’t just be a counter,” she said. “It’ll be a whole experience, a place where students can study, friends can hang out after dinner, or families can enjoy a sweet treat together.”\nEvents like sip-and-paints, “Love Island” watch parties, and sports game nights are also in the works.\n“Punkies will be for everybody,” she said, adding that family-friendly drink options like ICEEs and Shirley Temples will ensure the space remains inclusive.\nMore than sweets, Lawson sees Punkies as a platform for change.\n“I want it to be a space of influence, support, and mentorship, especially for the youth in Vicksburg,” she said.\nShe’s already hosted multiple community events, like the upcoming Summer Fling Fest on July 27, 2025 at Washington Street Park, her third citywide pop-up featuring vendors, food, music, and family-friendly activities.\nBut Lawson’s vision extends even further. She dreams of launching mentorship programs and workshops for young people interested in entrepreneurship.\n“Even though I’m only 21, I know there’s a generation coming up that needs guidance and someone to show them what’s possible.”\nLawson is already setting her sights on the future, with a goal of a Punkies drive-thru and wider expansion into schools, hospitals, and high-traffic locations.\n“I want Punkies to be a household name, not just for desserts, but for opportunity and community impact,” she said.\nLawson has learned hard lessons along the way; the importance of structure, setting boundaries, and knowing when to say no. Being young, she often felt underestimated.\n“People didn’t always see the vision,” she said. “I had to let my work speak for itself.”\nShe credits her early work experience at Chick-fil-A for much of her business discipline.\n“It taught me structure, customer service, and how to handle pressure,” she said. “To be a good leader, you have to be a good follower first.”\nLawson also offered advice for other up and coming entrepreneurs.\n“Discipline is everything,” she said. “Talent alone isn’t enough. Put yourself in the right environments, stay focused, and stay humble.”\nLawson’s drive is rooted in deep gratitude and strong faith.\n“First and foremost, I want to thank God. None of this would be possible without Him,” she said.\nShe also credits her parents, both educators and business owners, for shaping her work ethic.\n“My dad is always there, no matter how busy he is,” she said. “And my mom is my calm in the chaos.”\nTo every friend, supporter, and customer, she offers heartfelt thanks.\n“Whether you wore a Punkies shirt, helped with supplies, or just encouraged me, you’ve made a difference.”\nThrough all the growth, Lawson remains grounded.\n“As things grow, it’s important that I stay connected to who I am and keep God first in everything I do,” she said. “This isn’t just a business,” she said. “It’s my purpose.”",

    "title": "L.A. Lakers mystique was alive and well in '23 on DraftKings' sportsbook in Ontario.",
    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors.\nThe Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action.\n\"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors.\n\"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\"\nThe Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets.\nThe Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series.\nToronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth.\nToronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers.\nAvello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list.\n\"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\"\nThe Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots.\nNo Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks.\nToronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops.\nLast month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\n\"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\"\nSurprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC.\nBuffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot.\n\"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada.\n\"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\"\nBuffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth.\nOntario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion.\nToronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967.\n\"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\"\nThe Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth).\nRick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference.\nPeter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates.\n\"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play.\n\"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press",

Su tierra, Huelva, ha querido hacerle un homenaje como se merece por toda su carrera y por presumir allá donde va de ser onubense. La jugadora de bádminton era recibida en el ayuntamiento por las autoridades locales, entre las que se encontraba la alcaldesa, Pilar Miranda. Esta leía unas palabras y luego Carolina hablaba y atendía a los medios. Lo primero que hacía era agradecer todo el cariño que ha recibido durante todos estos meses. \"Ha sido abrumador.

Siento que de alguna forma tengo que devolver ese cariño\", comenzaba diciendo. \"Aquí en Huelva la gente... esto es increíble. Somos una familia. En el momento en el que me operé de la rodilla me bajé aquí a mi tierra para rodearme de mi familia. A principio se me hizo muy duro porque estaba viviendo un momento muy crítico en mi carrera deportiva y yo como persona. Era importante sacarme de esa ciudad y del agujero en el que yo estaba, pero mi familia me ayudó mucho\", comentó Carolina Marín. Es por todo eso por lo que la deportistas día a día intenta devolver el cariño que ha recibido en esos duros momentos para ella. Carolina Marín y su sueño para 2026 Le preguntaron por la posibilidad de que el campeonato europeo de bádminton se celebre en 2026 en Huelva. \"Pilar y yo hemos estados reunidas hablando de muchos temas y uno de ellos ha sido el europeo de 2026. Ella me ha comentado que desde el ayuntamiento apoyan a que se pueda hacer aquí. Le he dicho que para mi es una ilusión muy grande. Ahora mismo no me quiero presionar para nada. Quiero tomarle el tiempo que mi cuerpo y me corazón necesiten. Si llego a esa cita ojalá que toda Huelva y yo también pueda disfrutarlo\". Tras atender a los medios, Carolina salía al balón del ayuntamiento para saludar a los fans que habían congregados. Cerca de mil personas la esperaba. La deportista leyó la misma carta que en el interior y tras recibir una ovación, no pudo evitar emocionarse.",

This is according to a Mississippi Office of the State Auditor's [press release](https://www2.osa.ms.gov/news/former-mayor-of-beulah-arrested-for-three-counts-of-embezzlement/).

If convicted, Thomas faces up to 20 years and $5,000 in fines per count. “Big or small, we will continue to identify embezzlement of your taxpayer dollars and forward these cases to prosecutors for enforcement,” State Auditor Shad White said in the news release.
