    "text": "首页/\n城市/\n新政/\n经济/\n社会/\n文化/\n体育+/\n科教卫\n杭州日报讯 眼下，浙江春茶采摘正值旺季。与往年不同的是，今年茶园里来了不少特殊的“新园丁”。\n走进位于海拔530米的丽水市松阳县竹源乡呈田村，智慧茶园里的“黑科技”令人眼前一亮：防霜扇缓缓转动，智能杀虫灯静静值守，而埋设在茶树根部的传感器，正24小时“监测”着土壤的温湿度变化。\n“这些数据会实时传输到后台系统，AI算法能精准计算出每片茶园需要的水肥量。”大土至爱（浙江）科技有限公司负责人宋阳指着手机里的茶园管理App介绍。\n在这个“会思考”的茶园里，大数据实现精准管理。“环境监测、可视化管理、智能控制，这就是我们的‘智慧茶园三部曲’。”宋阳透露，这套系统不仅能节省水肥成本，还能让茶叶品质提升一个等级，真正实现了“生态账”和“经济账”的双赢。\n清晨，在杭州市西湖区茶场村，数台多光谱无人机划破晨雾从茶垄间腾空而起。不远处，茶农杨志良正在用手机观测每片芽叶的形状。“以前都要靠人工去观察哪块茶地可以采摘，现在不用挨个去看了，通过无人机一看就知道，省时又省力。”杨志良感慨道。\n“除了帮助茶农直接观测茶树生长状态，多光谱无人机在茶树的日常生态防治中也起着重要作用。”浙江托普云农科技股份有限公司工作人员潘宁介绍，这种数字化无人机可以实时采集茶园多光谱照片，通过数字茶园管理平台，联动智能虫情测报灯、气象监测系统、土壤墒情监测站等设备，构建全域地形数据库，及时高效开展无人机统防统治，从而达到科学、高效的生态防治。比如，前几天有霜冻天气，我们提前通过监测数据判断灾害等级，帮助农户及时采取措施，减少了损失。",

    "text": "CALDWELL COUNTY, Texas – The husband of Guadalupe County District Clerk Linda Balk was sentenced to seven years of community supervision and ordered to pay more than $245,000 in restitution as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors filed with the court this summer, records show. The plea deal, which allows Josh Balk, 45, to avoid prison time, also requires him to perform 200 hours of community service, to complete a theft education class and to go through behavioral therapy, court records show. Caldwell County officials released the records this week, following a public records request from [KSAT Investigates](https://www.ksat.com/news/ksat-investigates/). Josh Balk, the husband of Linda Balk, was [indicted and arrested in 2019](https://www.ksat.com/news/2019/09/12/guadalupe-county-district-clerks-husband-arrested-after-pouring-30k-into-wifes-campaign/) on charges of theft between $150,000 and $300,000 and misapplication of fiduciary property between $150,000 and $300,000. The indictment came after a lengthy criminal investigation in multiple counties that was eventually handed off to the Texas Attorney General’s Office for prosecution. Josh Balk’s criminal case was [moved from Guadalupe County to Caldwell County](https://www.ksat.com/news/defenders/2020/11/19/change-in-venue-granted-in-theft-trial-for-husband-of-guadalupe-county-district-clerk/#:~:text=Josh%20Balk%2C%2041%2C%20will%20now,the%20KSAT%2012%20Defenders%20show.) in 2020, after his attorneys successfully argued it would be difficult for him to have a fair trial if it remained in Guadalupe County. The plea agreement was signed in court in late April of last year, and filed as an order of deferred adjudication this June, Caldwell County court records show. Josh Balk’s attorney told KSAT Thursday that the conviction will appear as dismissals on Josh Balk’s criminal record if he completes the terms of the agreement. Linda Balk accepted more than $30K in contributions from Josh Balk’s construction company Linda Balk, who was first elected to office in 2018 and then re-elected in 2022, accepted more than $30,000 in campaign contributions from her husband’s construction company as he hurtled toward bankruptcy in 2018, campaign records show. [Many of the contributions](https://www.ksat.com/news/2019/01/18/contractor-accused-of-taking-clients-money-poured-30k-into-wifes-district-clerk-campaign/) to her 2018 campaign came within days of Josh Balk taking draws from a construction loan, records show. The campaign contributions included two large payments for advertising expenses and one loan. “I will serve to them, and no comment. You can talk to my consultant,” Linda Balk told KSAT after her formal swearing-in ceremony on New Year’s Day 2019. Linda Balk did not respond to an email seeking comment Thursday.

    "text": "“I didn’t want to go to the Lakers….” Dwight Howard admits playing with Kobe Bryant was tough\nFormer Orlando Magic star Dwight Howard wanted to beat Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, not join them.\nDwight Howard talks about Kobe Bryant pairing\nKobe Bryant had one of the greatest basketball careers of any NBA player. In the 20 years he dribbled a basketball, he won five championships playing alongside two Hall of Famers. However, he could have had at least one more when he had another superstar player alongside him. Dwight Howard was the second big man from the Orlando Magic that the Los Angeles Lakers brought in. But it didn’t work out.\nThe former NBA champion was a guest on Gils Arena, where they discussed his career. When asked specifically about the time in LA, Howard revealed some eye-catching details. Moreover, the defensive stalwart also revealed why the pairing didn’t work out.\nIt was difficult playing with Kobe. Because of one, it's the expectation you know winning. And then two is, everybody expected me and Kobe to be the new Kobe and Shaq. I was already p*ssed cause I had to go to LA. I didn't want to go to the Lakers. Because I wanted to beat them. I made an emotional decision to leave, and I do regret that.Dwight Howard via Gils Arena\nDwight Howard was clear that both the Magic and the Lakers forced him to accept the move. He either wanted to stay with the Orlando Magic and win a title. If he had to move, he would have preferred to move to any other Eastern Conference team, as his motivation was to beat the Los Angeles Lakers. Instead, the forced move put him in a rough spot.\nNot only was he not happy, but he let his\nemotions get the better of him. As he now regrets that he did not win over his mind and make it work. He could have won an NBA title with Kobe Bryant if he bought into the idea of playing alongside him.\nDwight Howard eventually returned to win NBA title with Lakers\nHis emotions still wanted him to beat the Lakers and win an NBA title. That led Dwight Howard to\nJames Harden, who led the Houston Rockets then. Despite being again part of a formidable duo, the NBA title aspirations fell short. Then, with further stops on multiple teams, he eventually found himself out of favor as a starter.\nHe took the chance to rebuild his physique and accept that he could have an impact from the bench. That’s what brought him back to the Los Angeles Lakers. As a part of the team led by\nLeBron James, the 8-time All-Star was finally an NBA champion. That title finally filled that one glaring hole in his career.\nHoward tried to win more in his next two years again as a role player but fell short. Now, after all these years, he wished he had focused on the task at hand. He could have been a part of Lakers folklore had he won a title with the great Kobe Bryant.\nIn case you missed:",
