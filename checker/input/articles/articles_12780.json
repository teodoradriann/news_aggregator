    "text": "Una donna è stata portata in ospedale, al “San Giovanni di Dio” di Agrigento, dopo essere stata sfregiata al volto con dell’acido lanciato dal marito\nClamorosa svolta nell’inchiesta sul caso donna che ha denunciato di essere stata sfigurata con l’acido dal marito, dal quale sarebbe fuggita dopo avere subito maltrattamenti. I poliziotti del commissariato di Palma di Montechiaro, nell’Agrigentino, stanno eseguendo un’ordinanza di custodia cautelare in carcere a carico della cinquantenne. Il marito 48enne, ricoverato al centro grandi ustioni dell’ospedale Cannizzaro di Catania con gravi ferite alle mani e al collo, è stato arrestato il 5 dicembre scorso con l’accusa di lesioni personali gravissime.\nLa sua versione dei fatti è stata sempre opposta rispetto a quella della moglie: “E’ stata lei ad aggredirmi – ha detto al gip – quella bottiglietta con l’acido non l’ho neppure toccata”. La donna, al contrario, ha raccontato di essersi allontanata senza avvisare nessuno, commettendo una leggerezza, dalla struttura protetta in cui era fuggita, e di averlo contattato per prendere dei vestiti. Lì, secondo il suo racconto, avrebbe trovato il marito con una bottiglietta in mano contenente dell’acido che le avrebbe spruzzato sul viso riuscendo ad avere la meglio solo perchè aveva guadagnato una posizione superiore nei gradini della scala. La donna, che ha la parte destra del volto sfigurata, se l’è cavata con venti giorni di prognosi.\nIl 9 gennaio erano in programma gli accertamenti di laboratorio alla polizia scientifica. Nel pomeriggio di oggi è giunta l’inattesa novità. La donna, assistita dal suo legale Giuseppe Vinciguerra, si trova tuttora al commissariato di Palma dove stanno eseguendo il provvedimento di cui non si conoscono i dettagli.",

    "text": "Oregon football's Jestin Jacobs on finding rhythm in first healthy offseason since 2022 After injuries derailed a promising start to his career at Iowa, Jestin Jacobs transferred to Oregon before last season, with more injuries nagging at the inside linebacker throughout the summer and fall camp. Finally, about halfway through the Ducks' season against Washington State, [Jacobs made his Duck debut](https://www.registerguard.com/story/sports/college/football/2023/10/21/oregon-ducks-football-linebacker-jestin-jacobs-plays-first-game-after-injury-pac-12/71277798007/) and played the final eight games of the season at close to full health. Now in the second official week of spring ball, Jacobs is fully healthy for the first offseason since 2022 at Iowa. \"It's very important for me,\" Jacobs said. \"A fully healthy offseason you just get into a flow. In football you like to get in a rhythm. When you're missing time and you're in and out, you're missing the flow. You're not getting the footwork that you get on a daily basis seeing football. \"When you're available that's when you're getting better. When you're sitting out, it's not the same.\" Over his eight games last season Jacobs finished with 32 total tackles and a sack in his first game against the Cougars, and had a decision to make whether or not he'd enter the NFL draft or return for a second season at Oregon. To Jacobs, it wasn't much of a decision at all. \"I missed half the year, I didn't get a full year with the guys,\" he said. \"So in my mind, I have a lot left to prove that I didn't show.\" The incoming senior said he's particularly worked at getting his body right so he can stay on the field, and studied the playbook again so he can help fellow senior inside linebacker Jeffrey Bassa captain the middle of the defense. \"That's been the biggest change for me so far is the confidence in knowing the defense and being able to relay it,\" Jacobs said. \" It's been a gigantic jump in confidence. Even during the season I was a little hesitant with the defense, now when we had the time off and I got to dive back into the playbook ... it grew in confidence.\" Alec Dietz covers University of Oregon football, volleyball, women’s basketball and baseball for The Register-Guard.

    "text": "Manipal : Manipal Centre for Biotherapeutics Research (MCBR), MAHE, Manipal has entered into partnership agreement with Kore Additive Manufacturing and Medical Reconstruction Pvt. Ltd. (KoreAMMR), Mumbai to codevelop 3D printed biotherapeutic products. KoreAMMR has leased a portion of GMP compliant facility of MCBR to codevelop the novel 3D bioprinted products along with MCBR faculty and researchers. The partnership facility was inaugurated by Dr Narayan Sabhahit, Pro Vice Chancellor – Technology and Science, MAHE, Dr P Giridhar Kini, Registrar MAHE, Mr Ravindra Doshi, Managing Director KoreAMMR and Mr Chaitanya Doshi, CEO of KoreAMMR.\nWhile signing the agreement Dr Giridhar Kini, Registrar, MAHE, and Mr Ravindra Doshi, Managing Director of KoreAMMR, lauded the partnership to develop novel products and hoped to see the codeveloped products entering the commercial market soon. MCBR founding Head and MAHE COO Dr Raviraja N S said, “signing this agreement with KoreAMMR while MCBR is celebrating 3 year of establishment is a significant milestone, and this multifaceted partnership is aimed to develop new 3D bioprinted products for biomedical applications and to train human resource needed in this niche area”.\nMr Chaithanya Joshi, CEO, KoreAMMR said “the partnership with MCBR is a crucial for KoreAMMR and we will start manufacturing for clinical trials in this facility’’.\nDr Kirthanashri, Coordinator and Associate Professor of MCBR and Group leader in 3D bioprinting said “As part of this collaborative agreement KoreAMMR employees can enrol for PhD at MAHE and work under the supervision of faculty guides at MCBR. The master’s students of MCBR can intern at KoreAMMR to complete their dissertation”.\nKoreAMMR was founded in July 2022 with the mission to make affordable 3D Bioprinted transplantable organs and is incubated at SINE IIT Bombay and RIIDL KJ Somaiya in Mumbai. The founder was inspired by Dr Anthony Atala who in the year 2011 made the first 3D Bioprinted urinary bladder and transplanted it into the patient and the patient is alive and healthy today. The main challenge faced by KoreAMMR is the time it takes to clear the regulatory pathway to use 3D Bioprinted products for medical application. By collaborating with MCBR and MAHE, KoreAMMR is expecting to complete these clinical trials within 5-7 years significantly lowering the cost and time taken to develop 3D Bioprinted products and commercialize them. KoreAMMR is also working on developing organ on chip systems with MCBR to eliminate need for animal testing in exchange of human relevant organ models for pharmaceutical drug discovery and drug testing and for personalized medicine in the field of oncology. Through this collaboration KoreAMMR and MAHE will be able to train the next generation of biotechnology and biomedical scientists and engineers to make India a global leader in the Biotechnology and Biomedical domain.\nDr Harish Kumar, Director, Corporate Relations; Dr Arun Maiya, Dean, MCHP; Dr Srinivas Mutalik, Principal MCOPS; Dr Naveen Salins, Associate Dean, KMC Manipal and others were present during the occasion.",

    "title": "Retirees: 2 Great Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy for Passive Income in 2024",
    "text": "Canadian seniors are searching for ways to squeeze more passive income out of their savings to help offset rising living costs. One popular strategy to achieve the goal is to own top\nTSX dividend-growth stocks inside a self-directed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).\nEnbridge\nEnbridge (\nTSX:ENB) is a major player in the North American energy infrastructure industry. The company’s networks of oil and natural gas pipelines move 30% of the oil produced in the U.S. and Canada and 20% of the natural gas used in the United States. In recent years, Enbridge has focused its growth investments on other segments, including oil exports, natural gas exports, natural gas utilities, and renewable energy. For example, the company recently announced a US$14 billion deal to buy three natural gas utilities in the United States.\nEnbridge stock trades below $48 at the time of writing compared to $59 at one point in 2022.\nThe drop looks overdone. Enbridge’s assets have performed well in 2023, and the company expects the new acquisitions and the ongoing capital program to generate revenue and cash flow growth in the next few years.\nEnbridge raised the dividend by 3.1% for 2024. This is the 29th consecutive annual dividend hike. Investors who buy at the current price can get a 7.7% dividend yield.\nBCE\nBCE (\nTSX:BCE) is another top Canadian dividend stock that looks oversold and offers a great yield. The share price is down to about $51.50 at the time of writing compared to $65 earlier this year. High interest rates are driving up borrowing costs for BCE. As with Enbridge, the company has a large capital program and uses debt to finance part of the overall investments. A jump in borrowing expenses will contribute to a small drop in profits in 2023. Weak ad sales in the media business will also put some pressure on earnings.\nThat being said, BCE still expects to generate higher total revenue and better free cash flow in 2023 than it did last year. This should provide support for the dividend in 2024. BCE raised the payout by at least 5% in each of the past 15 years. Investors who buy BCE stock at the current price can get a 7.5% dividend yield.\nThe bottom line on top stocks for passive income\nOngoing volatility in the market should be expected, and further downside is possible in the next few months. That being said, Enbridge and BCE are leaders in their respective industries and pay attractive dividends that should continue to grow. If you have some cash to put to work in a TFSA focused on passive income, these stocks already look cheap and deserve to be on your radar.",
