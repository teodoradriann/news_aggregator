    "title": "How This JetBlue Airbus A321 Made A Huge Milestone",
    "text": "After opening its first US manufacturing plant in Mobile Alabama\n, Airbus\ndelivered its first A321 from the facility to JetBlue Airways\nin April 2016. The $600 million project was announced in 2012 and the plant was inaugurated in late 2015.\nJetBlue took the delivery of the first-ever US-produced Airbus, which still flies for the airline after over nine years. It is registered as N965JT and was reconfigured on delivery from having 190 economy seats to 200. John Leahy, Airbus COO, on the day of the delivery, said:\n“The Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility has brought together all the best aspects of our other assembly lines around the world, and it shows how Airbus people work hand in hand with our partners to deliver great aircraft to our customers.”\nAs of today, the US Manufacturing Facility is one of four assembly and delivery points for the A320 family and one of two for the A220 worldwide.\nMore about the Airbus facility\nThe facility is an assembly and delivery site for Airbus, where all different parts of the aircraft are delivered and assembled. The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), selected Mobile in 2005 to be the location of the company’s US facility.\nKey factors in selecting Mobile were proximity to a deep water port and large open space around the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. The primary goal at the beginning was to have a better position competing in military contacts. In 2008, Airbus aggressively bid on supplying the US Air Force\nwith Airbus A330\nconverted tankers (KC-45). However, the bid was finally lost.\nRelated\nWhere Is Airbus Based? Examining The Manufacturer's 5 Most Important Facilities\nThe European planemaker has a truly global presence.\nHowever, interest in opening a US facility remained, and in June 2012, Airbus officially announced that the plan would come to fruition as an assembly line for the A320 family. The plan encompassed a $600 million factory at Brookley Aeroplex, which was eventually opened in September 2015.\nJohn Leahy, Airbus’ COO, praised the execution of the project during the first delivery.\n“Going from breaking ground on this facility three years ago to handing over the first Alabama-produced A321 today is an amazing accomplishment. It’s a testament to how well executed this project was and how strong the teamwork has been here in Mobile and throughout Airbus.”\nThe facility in the US is one of four in the world, working 24 hours in line with the adage “The Sun Never Sets on Airbus.” They are located in:\n- Mobile, Alabama\n- Hamburg, Germany\n- Toulouse, France\n- Tianjin, China\nHow it supports the local economy\nThe opening of the facility has not been indifferent to the local economy, with not only Airbus creating jobs themselves but also many other suppliers coming parallel to the region, boosting the market.\nC. Jeffrey Knittel, Chairperson and CEO of Airbus Americas, said:\n“When we announced our intent to build A320 Family aircraft in the United States and to locate that facility in Mobile, Alabama, we also stated our intent to be a good neighbour, to create jobs and opportunities, and to help strengthen the U.S. aerospace industry. Five years later, we have become a major economic driver in creating an aerospace hub on the Gulf Coast,”\nAdditionally, the manufacturer hires almost 90% of its employees from the Gulf Coast region, and around 30% of them are US military veterans\n. With plans to expand and triple its production rate, Airbus is constructing even more assembly and painting plants that will strengthen its position in the sector.\nRelated\nHow Does Business Aviation Impact Local Economies?\nBusiness aviation makes an unseen but significant impact on local economies.\nWith an objective to produce 75 aircraft monthly by 2027, the manufacturer has pledged to create 1,000 extra jobs that will facilitate the expansion.\n“Our operations in Alabama play a significant role in the expansion of Airbus’ global industrial capacity.” Daryl Taylor, Senior Vice president of Commercial Aircraft Operations for Airbus in the US, said. \"We look forward to seeing the positive impact that this growth will have on our region for many years to come.”\nNew plans include a new Delivery Center, hangar bays, a new final assembly line (FAL), and production floors. Construction will extend beyond the current year.\nThe expansion is being carried out by Brasfield & Gorrie construction firm, which is focusing on the 360,000-square-foot final assembly line for the Airbus A320 and most of the other significant structures. The company has been Airbus’s choice for construction projects since the inception of the facility in 2012. The program manager for the company, HPM, concluded that:\n“Bright days are ahead for Airbus as they look forward to completing the FAL 320 program, which will double the size of the Airbus footprint in North America and catapult the industry to new heights.”\nWhat aircraft are produced at the Airbus Mobile plant?\nSince opening the facility in 2015, Airbus has delivered over 500 aircraft (as of August 2024), with 180 aircraft being completed in the first five years. The site was initially set up only to manufacture the A320 family. However, it was expanded in 2017 to facilitate the production of the smaller Airbus A220 .\nThe Mobile plant is the final assembly line for the A320 family, centered around deliveries to US-based airlines. The first aircraft produced was delivered to JetBlue in 2016, and the 500th to Delta Air Lines in 2024.\nMost of the components are built in Europe and later make their way to the Port of Mobile on ships. The factory was the last to build the A320ceo, having delivered the last aircraft with a current engine option to Delta in 2021.\nRelated\nAirbus A220: Where Will The Next Big Orders Come From?\nAirbus A220 orders have slowed and will likely be net negative in 2024. Where will the next orders come from?\nAs of 2019, new A220 are also assembled in the facility, with the first airframe being delivered to Delta in 2020. The aircraft is also manufactured in Quebec, Canada\nin a facility previously owned by Bombardier\n, after the acquisition of the CSeries\nprogram. The decision to open the assembly line in Alabama was primarily to avoid tariffs related to selling Canadian-manufactured aircraft to US airlines, which later turned out not to be an issue.\nWhere does Boeing manufacture its narrowbody aircraft?\nBoeing has three notable manufacturing plants in the US:\n- Everett Factory – Wide-body manufacturing facility\n- South Carolina – 787 Dreamliner manufacturing facility\n- Renton Factory – Narrowbody manufacturing facility\nRenton can be considered a competing manufacturing facility for Airbus, as it is where the 737 MAX and 737 P-8\nPoseidon military variant is produced.\n[Related\n](/boeing-build-locations/)\nThe plant, which covers 1,100,000 square feet and is located near Renton Municipal Airport, was opened in 1941 and serves many different aircraft models.\nAfter the the 737 program was introduced in 1967, the aircraft became Boeing’s most popular model, with almost 11,000 sold as of 2022. Built aircraft are usually flown from the facility to the Seattle completion center, where final adjustments, such as interior and painting, are made.\nAt Boeing’s Renton Factory, the following models have been manufactured:\n- B-29 Superfortress – Total of 1,119 built\n- C-97 Stratofighter – Total of 943 built\n- Boeing 707 – First one was produced in 1957, and many still remain in service, in tanker configuration. In total 865 airliners were built.\n- Boeing 727 – Total of 1,832 built\n- Boeing 737 – Primary product of the Renton Factory\n- Boeing 757 – Last one was produced in 2004. In total, 1,049 were manufactured\nOpening the manufacturing plant in Mobile, Alabama was a big moment for the American aviation industry. The first delivery of the [Airbus A321](/tag/airbus-a321/)\nto JetBlue in 2016 not only solidified the European giant's presence in the US but also led to the creation of one of the biggest aviation centers in the Gulf area.\nAngela Till, Deputy Secretary of the [Alabama Department of Commerce](https://www.madeinalabama.com/):\n“Airbus’ ever-expanding footprint in Mobile has become the core of a rapidly growing aerospace cluster throughout the Gulf Coast. This continued growth is a big vote of confidence in the quality and caliber of its Alabama workforce,”\nThanks to its strategic location, the plant became a key point on the global aircraft manufacturing map, positively affecting the region's economic growth.\nThe facility not only created thousands of new jobs but also attracted other companies and investors, setting the foundations for continued growth.\n“Mobile remains on track to become one of the largest aerospace manufacturing hubs in the world, and I look forward to seeing Airbus reach future milestones at its Alabama home,” Till highlighted.\nPlans to triple the current production rates by 2027 and continuous investments in the infrastructure show that Airbus has a big vision for its US location. Innovations, developments, and rising demand strengthen manufacturers' position in the US market.\nExpansions, such as the new A220 line, prove that the near future will bring more and more accomplishments, making Mobile a key strategic place for Airbus.",

    "title": "Vuelve la 'carrera del plogging': correr mientras se recoge basura del bosque - El Periódico",
    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente No solo se trata de correr más que los otros para llegar antes. Se trata de hacerlo limpiando de basura el monte a tu paso. Eso es el 'plogging' una modalidad a medio camino entre el deporte y la concienciación ecológica que tiene su gran cita el próximo 16 de marzo en varios parajes de la comarca de Osona, cuando se celebra la Ultra Clean Marathon’24 .\nLos participantes recorrerán 36 kilómetros caminando o 60 corriendo por senderos recogiendo residuos a su paso Se trata de la carrera de referencia del 'plogging' en Catalunya y este año alcanza su sexta edición mezclando deporte, naturaleza, sostenibilidad y solidaridad. La Ultra Clean Marathon 2024 está organizada por la Xarxa per a la Conservació de la Natura (XCN) y la Agència de Residus de Catalunya (ARC) y tiene el mismo recorrido que el año pasado con salida y llegada a Vic pasando por las Guilleries, Sau y otros parajes del río Ter.\nNoticias relacionadas\nAlerta ante el posible colapso de la gran corriente oceánica del Atlántico: qué significa y qué implicaciones podría tener Fumar influye de forma permanente en el sistema inmunitario: \"Los daños persisten incluso después de dejarlo\" Los organizadores de la Ultra Clean Marathon señalan que es una \"carrera sostenible y solidaria con la naturaleza\" que permite \"conectar con la naturaleza\" al limpiar residuos , lo que transforma \"la pasión deportiva en acción concreta para la conservación de nuestro entorno\".\nDos circuitos En la edición de este año existe una novedad para hacer la carrera más participativa. Los equipos podrán elegir entre un circuito corto de 36 kilómetros, en equipos de 2 a 6 integrantes que pueden ir andando o corriendo, y otro, para corredores más preparados, un recorrido de 60 km del ultratrail, en equipos de 2 a 12 personas y haciendo relevos cada 10 km.\nLos organizadores señalan que el primer circuito también se puede hacer en tramos d e 10 kilómetros para participantes que quieren apoyar la conservación del medio ambiente, pero no están en condiciones físicas de correr tanto.\nLa condición imprescindible es realizarlo mientras recogen los residuos abandonados en los espacios naturales que van encontrando a su paso. Al final de la carrera se premia, entre otras clasificaciones, al equipo que más residuos haya recogido a lo largo del recorrido . Por el momento hay unos 30 equipos inscritos , aunque hay tiempo para hacerlo hasta el 1 de marzo.\n636 kilos de basura Este año también hay un ranking de donaciones para incentivar la participación solidaria y la concienciación ambiental de los participantes. Los equipos que recauden más dinero para la causa ambiental que elijan serán premiados. Para participar en el circuito corto, los equipos deben dar un mínimo de 300 euros a uno de los proyectos que promueven las entidades ambientales que trabajan en Catalunya. Para los participantes del circuito largo la cantidad mínima es de 600 euros.\nEn la pasada edición, 27 equipos y 210 corredores retiraron de la naturaleza 636 kilos de residuos y se recaudaron 12.650 euros para 18 entidades ambientales de Catalunya.\nImagen de la Ultra Clean Marathon del año pasado / Ultra Clean Marathon\nLa carrera se organiza de forma sostenible con un plan de gestión ambiental siguiendo la 'Guía de buenas prácticas en la organización y celebración de carreras y marchas por montaña' de la Generalitat y la Diputación de Barcelona, como la ausencia de cintas de señalización en todo el recorrido (se sigue el recorrido a través de GPS), el uso de garrafas de agua, vasos reutilizables y alimentos ecológicos en los puntos de avituallamiento y los dorsales en tejido reciclado.\nEquipos que repiten Entre los participantes hay equipos organizados por empresas, organismos, escuelas, clubs deportivos y asociaciones. R epiten algunos de ediciones anteriores como Peusa, distribuidora de energías renovables, los 4 equipos de las escuelas Vedruna, o los 2 del Club de Tenis Sabadell . También repite Nnormal, que presenta un equipo de la Fundación Killian Jornet, encabezado por su coordinadora de educación y madre del popular corredor de montaña, Núria Burgada, e integrado por miembros de la entidad Transpirenaica Social Solidaria, con la participación de personas en riesgo de exclusión social .\nEl equipo de embajadores UCM - Urbaser contará con la participación de personas de reconocido prestigio en el ámbito del running: Anna Comet, ganadora del MDS 2022; Xavi Marina, especialista en pruebas por etapas por todo el mundo; Marta Molist, ganadora del Ultra Pirineo 2023; Jesús Gellida, finisher del MDS; Gerard Morales (Blacky), campeón de España de Trail Running; Erika Núñez, ultra runner y profesora de Yoga; Arcadi Alibés, periodista deportivo de TV3 con 159 maratones en sus piernas; y el eco-aventurero Albert Bosch.\nUna carrera con \"valor doble\" Isaac Peraire, director de la Agència de Residus de Catalunya, señaló que esta carrera sirve \" como modelo para otros eventos deportivos, demostrando que es posible organizar competiciones de alta calidad mientras se prioriza el respeto por el medio ambiente \". Marc Traserra, técnico del Consejo Deportivo de Osona, ha explicado que “esta carrera tiene un valor doble\", ya que haces deporte de forma \"sostenible\" y aportando \"mucho valor al territorio\".\nPor su parte, Eduard Comerma, concejal de Actividad Física y Deportes del Ayuntamiento de Vic, ha señalado también en la presentación de esta prueba que la carrera \"encaja perfectamente\" con los valores del Consistorio como son \"correr en equipo, de manera sostenible y donde lo importante es participar ”.",
