    "text": "Today I want to tell you about this map. It is a complete map replacement, while keeping the same coordinates of all settlements, agents, resources, forts and towers, of which there are a lot. Since the 16th century BC, the most common type of world map is the Mercator projection, such as google maps. The second most common projection in the 19th century was Nicolosi's hemispheric projection, which was used by European cartographers from the 1660s onwards. Another projection, the Equal Intermediate projection, was used in maritime navigation. The Eras map is an Equal Intermediate projection of the globe, albeit a distorted one. It is noticeably stretched vertically, with America, Greenland and Iceland shifted to the right, reducing the width of the Atlantic. This is a good way of saving space to increase the total land area. In 1869, Jules Verne's novel 20000 Leagues Under the Sea was published, and in 1873-6, the Challenger expedition took place, which laid the foundation for oceanography. In the XIX century, mankind began to take an active interest in the ocean. In the new map this fact is also reflected and the sea bottom map was added to the sea colouring. The island of New Guinea and part of Australia Also the fog of war was added, hiding the territory not explored by scientists at the time of 1860. The dark clouds conceal Tibet, an iconic place for esoteric sects emerging in the West in the second half of the 19th century. The dark clouds conceal Tibet, an iconic place for esoteric sects emerging in the West in the second half of the 19th century. The remaining clouds show the usual atmospheric occurrences in the ocean.

This way, everyone who has downloaded this mod will be the first to test this map. [Steam & Steel v1.1 file - ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/steam-and-steel-total-war/downloads/steam-steel-v11) I recently adapted this map to Eras itself, and now I'm happy to share this version.",

    "text": "O Arsenal conseguiu o que muitos rivais não conseguiram nos últimos anos ao vencer com o Real Madrid por 2 a 1, no Santiago Bernabéu, e quebrar o \"pacto\" dos espanhóis para se garantir na semifinal da Champions.\nO jogo teve o VAR protagonista . O árbitro de vídeo foi fundamental para ajudar na marcação de um pênalti para o Arsenal — perdido por Saka — e para anular uma penalidade a favor do Real Madrid.\nSaka também foi personagem . O camisa 7 do Arsenal perdeu o pênalti ao tentar uma cavadinha, mas se redimiu e fez o primeiro gol dos ingleses da mesma maneira, desta vez com bola rolando. Martinelli fez o segundo dos Gunners, enquanto Vini Jr. descontou para o Real Madrid.\nO Arsenal volta à semifinal da Champions após 16 anos . Os Gunners disputaram esta fase da competição pela última vez em 2009, quando foram eliminados pelo Manchester United .\nClassificação e jogos",

In response, ZB Importing is implementing stricter labeling controls and an additional verification process for multilingual packaging.\nAnyone who purchased the affected Ulker Brand products is advised to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.
