O atacante Rafael Borré teve uma lesão muscular no posterior da coxa e será desfalque contra o Caxias, no próximo sábado (22), no Estádio Centenário, pelo jogo de ida da semifinal.\nA informação foi divulgada pelo colunista Vagner Martins, do portal GZH. O cenário não é animador, e Borré pode ficar fora do restante do estadual, caso o Colorado avance à final. Além dele, Alan Patrick, com entorse no tornozelo, e Wesley, também com lesão muscular, estão fora da decisão. Destes, apenas o capitão colorado tem chance de retornar em para o jogo de volta da semi, no próximo dia 1º\nSem Borré, o técnico Roger Machado deve apostar em Enner Valencia no ataque. Já Carbonero e Vitinho são os prováveis substitutos de Alan Patrick e Wesley, respectivamente. Outra mudança na equipe ocorre no meio-campo: com a saída de Thiago Maia para o Santos, Bruno Henrique deve ganhar sequência como titular.\nO Inter deve divulgar mais detalhes sobre a lesão de Borré nos próximos dias.",

Following that, he found his ultimate career path as a police officer, serving with the Manheim Township Police department from 1989-2014.

Dave was known for his calm presence, steady leadership, humor, and nerves of steel. He led by example, earning the respect of those around him through quiet strength and unwavering dedication. Dave was wise but humble and he never took life too seriously. Except for the business of hating cats, which was always serious. In time of hardship Dave and Laura Case reconnected and rekindled a friendship from their early twenties. In 2021, Dave married Laura. Laura and David enjoyed 3.5 years of married life, which unfortunately ended way too soon. He always made it a point to tell his loved ones how truly happy he was, and he loved nothing more than spending time with his beloved grandchildren, Owen and Cora. In addition to his parents, Dave was preceded in death by his sister, Debbie (Bair) Nadu and his first wife, Terri. He is survived by his wife, Laura (Case) Bair and her two sons, Ian and Kyle Case; his two children, Michael Bair, Laura (Bair), wife of Joe Pacheco; two grandchildren, Owen Lintner, Cora Pacheco.

    "text": "By Todd Feurer\nClick here for updates on this story\n CHICAGO ( WBBM ) — A Chicago real estate broker is headed to federal prison for scamming investors out of more than $3 million.\nStanislav “Steve” Sannikov, 42, was sentenced to four years and two months in prison on Friday, after pleading guilty last year to a federal wire fraud charge.\nSannikov owned Chestnut Realty Group, and prosecutors said from 2016 to 2020, he promised big profits on fake property deals – convincing victims to wire money into what he claimed were escrow accounts.\nProsecutors said those accounts were just personal checking accounts he used to fund a lavish lifestyle.\nSannikov had lied to his victims by telling them they were investing in properties that were for sale, and that could be resold or leased for a substantial profit, when the properties were not actually available for sale.\nOne victim in his 70s was forced to delay his retirement due to his losses.\n“This was not a one-time lapse in judgment,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheri H. Mecklenburg argued in the government’s sentencing recommendation. “Defendant, over the course of at least four years, designed and engaged in a calculated, sustained, multi-faceted scheme to defraud multiple individuals.”\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Sannikov must pay $2.19 million in restitution to four victims of his scam.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

Ahí fue donde ya no coincidíamos, ya no congeniamos y, en ese momento, se tomó la decisión, no nada más de tu servidor”, declaró para el diario AS de México. “No eres dueño del equipo y todo lo que he hecho en mi carrera, en mi profesión, nunca he sido dueño del equipo. Siempre ha habido un dueño encima de mí y siempre he tenido que congeniar con un dueño o con un presidente”, finalizó. Contenido GEC",

Although you’ve got to go with whatever opportunity life gives you.\n‘If I’m going to be a Traitor, then I will embrace it 100%.

    "text": "Wife of the Lagos State Governor, Mrs. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu , has advocated for proper waste management, especially in markets, to ensure a cleaner Lagos and better living for residents.\nMrs. Sanwo-Olu spoke at the Sabo Ultra-Modern Market Yaba, during a one-day seminar on Sanitisation and Security for Market Leaders in Yaba Local Council Development Area.\nThe seminar, organised by the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development, was to sensitise leaders on measures to prevent any forms of hazards within the markets.\nThe theme was ‘Improving Waste Management and Public Health in Markets: A Recipe for Economic Growth and Prosperity in Lagos Central Senatorial District’.\nThe governor’s wife explained that her office has continues to re-echo the importance of hygiene, safety and security in marketplaces, while supporting several initiatives of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration towards promoting market sanitation and safety.\nAccording to her, markets are the lifeblood of the economy that provides essential goods and services, but also posing environmental and health risks when people refuse to adhere to environmental guidelines on proper Waste Management.\nShe said: “Without proper waste management, we risk the possibility of contamination of food and water, air and water pollution, which do not only threaten the lives of consumers, but also the lives of traders.\n“But we can change the narrative by adhering strictly to guidelines which would help in converting waste to wealth when properly done. The Lagos of our dream and the 21St Century Economy we desire in Lagos would only be possible when we religiously adhere to the guidelines on proper waste disposal and recycling in our markets.",
