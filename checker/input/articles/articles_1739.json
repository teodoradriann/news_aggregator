He wrote: ‘What a way to start our spectacular New Year’s Eve fireworks show!’\nIn true British fashion, large parts of the country have welcomed 2024 in with a deluge of rain, but many who are out and about to celebrate the occasion will do their best not to let it dampen their spirits.\nThe iconic London fireworks were said to have soared as high as 200m into the air when they were launched from the London Eye on the stroke of midnight.\nIn Scotland, the 30th Hogmanay street party in Edinburgh will be headlined by rock band Pulp after their surprise reunion last year.\nEdinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said: ‘After the difficult years of the pandemic, I’m overjoyed that our festivals are back to their brilliant best and providing such high calibre cultural offerings for our residents and visitors.’\nElsewhere, there has already been an impressive firework show in Blackpool, as the explosives erupted into the sky with Blackpool Tower illuminated in the background.\nNEWCASTLE: A group of girls brave the horrible weather to see in the New Year together\nNEWCASTLE: A reveller covers her head from the rain with a piece of fabric as she heads out into town\nNEWCASTLE: A woman holds her coat aloft in a bid to keep dry ahead of New Year celebrations\nNEWCASTLE: Hardy revellers take cover under umbrellas, coats and even handbags to stay safe from the elements\nBLACKPOOL: Fireworks erupt over the water as a light show illuminates the Blackpool Tower\nEDINBURGH: Sisters Sophie (left) and Scarlett Strang (right) smile during Hogmanay celebrations\nEDINBURGH: University students from Japan pose with placards that spell out ‘2024’ in front of Edinburgh Castle\nPulp on stage in Princes Street Gardens as the world famous street party with 50,000 revellers attend Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Celebrations\nIn Newcastle’s Quayside crowds were treated to BAFTA award-winning artist Seb Lee-Delisle’s new Laser Light City laser show, which was projected onto the Baltic Flour Mills.\nRevellers also gathered in anticipation of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay firework display as musicians hyped the crowd up for an evening of entertainment.\nThousands of people are at the sold out Princes Garden Street Party and Concert in the Gardens in what mark’s the festival’s 30th anniversary.\nThe event, organised by UniqueAssembly and City of Edinburgh Council, will be headlined by Pulp, who have not played in the city in 20 years. Following their set, the fireworks will begin at midnight and will end at around 00.50am on Monday.\nAlex MacDonald, 26, said he is most excited for Pulp and the fireworks. He told the PA news agency: ‘I’m heavy looking forward to Pulp, like – it’s gonna be smashing. ‘The fireworks will be phenomenal man. It’ll be brilliant. We’ll have a heavy bevy to that, ken what I’m saying?’\nDave Reed, also 26, said he is ‘here for the tunes and everything else that’s happening’.\nHe added: ‘I’m well excited for the fireworks, it’s gonna be everything. ‘That’s what Edinburgh is all about, and that’s what Hogmanay is all about.’\nAhead of the main display, there were some small firework displays between different musical sets, much to the applause of the hyped-up crowd.\nCommenting on the news of a sell-out, Al Thomson, co-director of UniqueAssembly, said: ‘We’re in for one hell of a party now. Fifty thousand people in the streets of Edinburgh enjoying good music, good company, and one of the best fireworks displays in the world – there’s no better way to start the new year.\n‘We started things off right with the Torchlight Procession on Friday, where we saw 20,000 people come together to shine a light on homelessness, raising money for our charity partner Social Bite; and this is just the perfect end to the year and the best way to celebrate 30 years of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay.’\nHowever, not every planned event took place this evening, with Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland and a Devon town’s fireworks display both cancelled.\nA yellow weather warning for wind is in place for Britain’s entire southern coastline and south Wales.\nNEWCASTLE: Revellers brave the rain as they head for a night on the town in Newcastle\nNEWCASTLE: A pair of well-prepared revellers hold their umbrellas aloft as they walk through Newcastle city centre\nLEEDS: Two girls give a male reveller a peck on the cheek ahead of the last night out of the year\nLEEDS: A pair of ladies pose for the camera in Leeds city centre on New Year’s Eve\nLEEDS: A group of ladies take cover from the rain in Leeds under an umbrella as they head out to celebrate New Year\nBLACKPOOL: Spectacular fireworks erupt over the water next to Blackpool Tower as the iconic venue lights up for New Years\nLIVERPOOL: Revellers smile as they dart through the rain in a bid to reach the clubs and bars in Liverpool city centre\nLIVERPOOL: A pair of ladies cover their heads with jackets in a bid to stay dry this evening\nEDINBURGH: Brandon Fernandes and partner Tylo Verreynne embrace as they celebrate Hogmanay\nNEWCASTLE: A spectacular light show takes place at the Baltic Flour Mills in Newcastle’s Quayside\nNEWCASTLE: Crowds gather in front of the Baltic Flour Mills in Newcastle’s Quayside\nLONDON: Rain falls over the Houses of Parliament ahead of the New Year’s Eve fireworks\nNEWCASTLE: Revellers brave the rain and cold weather to enjoy the New Years Eve celebrations\nEDINBURGH: Visitors from Spain dress up in Santa hats ahead of Hogmanay New Year celebrations\nEDINBURGH: Partygoers get ready for a fun night ahead during the Hogmanay Street party celebrations\nEDINBURGH: A man and woman pose for the cameras after picking up some food during the Hogmanay New Year celebration\nEDINBURGH: Tourists from Brazil dress up in kilts for the Hogmanay New Year celebrations\nWhile the north west has been slapped with a rain warning with heavy downpours expected across Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Blackpool, Blackburn, and West Yorkshire.\nSaturday’s Eurostar cancellations hit one family who were hoping to make it back to Britain in time for New Years, after they were stranded in Brussels following a surprise trip for a Canadian relative.\nLuke Gibbs, 32, from Kenley, south London, travelled with his wife, Kyla, cousin Liam Eton and sister-in-law Brea Melanson, from Canada, and planned to arrive in London in time for New Year’s Eve celebrations on Sunday.\nMr Gibbs, a business development manager, paid £600 for a New Year’s Eve event in London Bridge, which is not refundable and now he cannot attend after his train from Brussels to St Pancras was cancelled. He described the communication with Eurostar as ‘appalling’.\n‘I think the way (Eurostar) dealt with it is pretty appalling in terms of not trying to say ‘this is how you rebook it, we’ll help you out with expenses’,’ Mr Gibbs told the PA news agency.\n‘They just said, ‘unfortunately, it’s cancelled, we’re sorry, get on with it’, which is shocking really.’\nOrganisers of Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland took the ‘very difficult decision’ to rip up its plans for New Year’s Eve tonight because of the expected stormy winds.\n‘As much as we are very disappointed and frustrated, your safety comes first, as well as ours, and we can’t possibly take the risk,’ they said as they confirmed those who had bought tickets will be fully refunded.\nElsewhere, Barnstaple, in Devon, cancelled its annual fireworks because of the ‘horrendous’ weather, reported Devon Live.\nBarnstaple Town Centre Management said it axed the display for safety reasons.\nWIGAN: Clubbers brave the cold and wet weather as they hit the city centre on New Year’s Eve\nLONDON: Met Police officers have descended on the capital ahead of New Year’s celebrations\nEDINBURGH: Fireworks explode during the New Year celebrations in Scotland\nEDINBURGH: Fireworks explode over Edinburgh Castle during the street party for Hogmanay New Year celebrations\nNEWCASTLE: A reveller gives his pal a piggyback as they enjoy the New Year’s Eve celebrations\nNEWCASTLE: Two friends strike a pose as they hit the town amid the cold and stormy conditions\nLEEDS: Partygoers did not let the grim weather dampen their spirits as they see in the New Year together\nThey said: ‘Unfortunately due to the weather conditions and the gusting winds we will be unable to do the fireworks this evening due to safety.\n‘We know this is disappointing, but safety is always the priority and we unfortunately can’t control the weather.’\nTemperatures are set to plummet on New Year’s Day and in January increasing the chance of sleet and snow on higher grounds in the north, with frosty mornings for many.\nWeather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: ‘There are growing signs of cold weather developing as we head through the first half of January.\n‘The chance of a significant cold spell is quite high.\n‘The highest risk of snow will probably be in the North and East. But if low pressure pushes up from the southwest, this would lead to the possibility of snow as weather fronts move northeast.’",

Lusa 29 de Dezembro de 2023 às 07:42 Os bispos católicos moçambicanos anunciaram esta sexta-feira ter decidido que \"não se dê bênção\" às \"uniões irregulares e uniões do mesmo sexo\", apesar da decisão contrária anunciada pelo Vaticano.\n\"Nós, os bispos, decidimos que em Moçambique não se dê bênção a uniões irregulares e uniões do mesmo sexo. Que o modelo de Igreja Família de Deus continue a ser o que inspira o nosso ser Igreja em Moçambique, e que Maria, Rainha da Família, guie e proteja as nossas famílias\", de acordo com um comunicado divulgado pela Conferência Episcopal de Moçambique (CEM).\nO Vaticano autorizou em 18 de dezembro, oficialmente, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo, \"em situação irregular\" para a Igreja, mantendo a oposição ao casamento homossexual.\nÉ a primeira vez que a Igreja se pronuncia claramente sobre a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo, um assunto que gera tensões no interior da instituição, devido a uma forte oposição do setor conservador, nomeadamente nos Estados Unidos.\nEsta bênção não \"será realizada ao mesmo tempo que os ritos civis de união, nem mesmo em relação a eles\", indicou, em documento, o Dicastério para a Doutrina da Fé, órgão da Santa Sé, aprovado pelo papa Francisco.\n\"O documento, depois de ter apresentado a riqueza e variedade do conteúdo indicado pelo termo bênção, autoriza o ministro ordenado a abençoar casais irregulares ou do mesmo sexo, facto este que está a provocar no meio das nossas comunidades cristãs, e não só, questionamentos e perturbações\", reconhece a CEM.\n\"A doutrina sobre o matrimónio e a família permanece inalterada porque, a bênção de que fala a Declaração, nada tem a ver com a liturgia e a celebração do sacramento do matrimónio, e a celebração deste sacramento não pode ser substituída de nenhum modo com uma bênção, como é prática nalgumas igrejas não católicas\", acrescentam os bispos, na mesma declaração.\nDefendem, contudo, que as pessoas que vivem em \"situação de união irregular não devem ser afastadas da comunidade cristã, mas devem ser ajudadas, como todo o fiel, a adequar a sua vida à vontade de Deus por meio da proximidade da Igreja que conforta, cuida e infunde coragem\".\n\"A Declaração [do Vaticano] afirma que a bênção apresentada como possível a ser invocada sobre uma união irregular ou do mesmo sexo, não pretende legitimar estas uniões. Porém, na mente de muitos fiéis e na linguagem comum, com o termo bênção entende-se o mesmo que legitimar o que se abençoa. Por isso, a CEM exorta todos os ministros ordenados para que manifestem proximidade e acompanhamento a quem vive em uniões irregulares\", conclui a declaração.\nApesar do não reconhecimento da Santa Sé, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo era já praticada por alguns padres, nomeadamente na Bélgica e na Alemanha.\nEsta declaração surgiu seis semanas depois do encerramento da assembleia-geral do Sínodo para o Futuro da Igreja Católica, uma reunião mundial consultiva, durante a qual, bispos, mulheres e laicos, debateram temas da sociedade como o acolhimento de pessoas LGBT+ ou os casamentos de divorciados.\nNo início de outubro, cinco cardeais conservadores exigiram publicamente ao papa Francisco que reafirmasse a doutrina católica sobre os casais gay, mas o documento final do Sínodo deixou esta questão de parte.\nEm 2021, o Vaticano havia reafirmado que considerava a homossexualidade \"um pecado\" e confirmou a impossibilidade de os casais do mesmo sexo receberem o sagrado matrimónio.\nDesde a eleição, em 2013, que Francisco insiste na importância de uma Igreja \"aberta a todos\" e tomou várias medidas que suscitaram a ira dos conservadores.",

    "text": "Minimizing Motor Vehicle Emissions Can Benefit Children’s Health NEW YORK, NY (ANI) – A recent study suggests that efforts to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from motor vehicles, along with investments in electric vehicles and public transit, would reduce air pollution and have a significant impact on children’s health. They’d also save money. The findings by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Boston University School of Public Health appear in the journal Environmental Research Letters. The researchers modeled the benefits of implementing multiple scenarios of the proposed climate policy framework known as the Transportation and Climate Initiative in 12 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. Under the most stringent cap on CO2 emissions and the investment scenario that devoted the most resources to mass transportation, they estimated a total of over 58,000 avoided cases of infant mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, autism spectrum disorder, new cases of asthma, worsened asthma symptoms, and other respiratory illnesses. The related economic savings were $82 million annually. Assessment of the distribution of avoided cases of worsened asthma symptoms indicated that children in all racial and ethnic groups benefited, with somewhat greater health benefits in non-white populations. Under TCI, fuel suppliers would be required to purchase carbon emissions allowances, the proceeds of which would go towards clean transportation programs. While this program was not implemented, it serves as a useful model for other climate mitigation policies. Specifically, researchers modeled changes in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide between 2022 and 2032 associated with on-road transportation sector emissions under nine hypothetical CO2 emissions cap and investment scenarios proposed under TCI. They estimated potential health co-benefits for adverse birth, pediatric respiratory, and neurodevelopmental outcomes using BenMAPR, a health impact assessment platform that builds from the EPA’s Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program. Researchers also note the importance of strategic decarbonization efforts as the climate crisis escalates. “Ambitious carbon caps and policies that focus on vulnerable groups, including children, can both improve health outcomes and help mitigate the impacts of climate change,” says first author Alique G. Berberian, MPH ’19, PhD student and graduate student researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. The researchers also note the importance of including health and environmental justice in climate policies. “Climate policies can have major effects not just on climate, but also on health and environmental justice. Our research shows the importance of including these other benefits of policies when evaluating climate policies,” said senior author Jonathan Buonocore, ScD, assistant professor of Environmental Health at Boston University School of Public Health.",

    "text": "6. Church of Jesus Christ donation to Krisan Refugee Camp The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has presented essential items to support the upkeep of immigrants at Krisan Refugee Camp at Krisan Town, in the Ellembelle District of the Western Region. The items consist of 100 bags of 25 kilograms (kg) rice, 25 cartons of canned fish, 100 carton of cooking oil, 100 buckets of tomato paste, 500 pieces of mosquito nets as well as 500 students’ mattresses and 300 bags of sachet water. “All these items are coming from the contributions of individuals from our branches in Ghana, Africa and across the world through our Humanitarian Aid,” President Christopher L. Morgan of The Churches of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Ghana Cape Coast Mission, explained. 1. Church of Jesus Christ donation to Krisan Refugee Camp Also, he said: “We give 10 percent of our tithes to the Church and we believe in alms, fasting, prophesying of faith and great pilgrims, among others. We offer support to help and bless all God’s children; we do what the Saviour Jesus Christ will do and I am honoured to be here with my wife, Christine Morgan, to present these items”. 3. Church of Jesus Christ donation to Krisan Refugee Camp He mentioned that the missionaries of the Church have been of great support to the camp and prayed all who contributed to this worthy course will be blessed abundantly. “We believe these items will make you stronger as well as the communities stronger. We pray these items will be a blessing upon you and we will encourage you to share with others for God to give us more,” President Morgan said. Emmanuel Akonful, Krisan Refugee Camp Manager, was grateful to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for the support. “The Church has been supporting the camp for some time now and I urge other organisations to follow suits for the immigrants to have a comfortable life,” he said. 10. Church of Jesus Christ donation to Krisan Refugee Camp He explained that the camp was set up in 1996 with some immigrants from Liberia following the conflict that distabilised the country. They settled at a town called Sanzule in the Ellembelle District and within three months, they moved to their present location at Krisan. “Currently, the refugees here are about 900, coming from 16 African countries such as Togo, Sudan, Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, among others. They are funded by the Government of Ghana, partnered by the United Nations and other organisations,” he further explained. 8. Church of Jesus Christ donation to Krisan Refugee Camp Like any other settlement, he said there has been a cordial relationship with the host communities. There are schools here, a clinic, a Police Station as well as a community centre that makes their lives lively. However, he said the camp is in need of additional shelter, a library and related amenities. “With the conflicts ranging in Sudan, Congo and other counties in the sub-region, there are refugees trooping in here. Therefore, we are appealing to cooperate organisations, church bodies as well as some philanthropists to support us from time to time since government alone cannot shoulder all the responsibilities,” Mr. Akonful added.

BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT A new fire station coming to SW Tallahassee is step closer to coming true. I'm Terry Gilliam your Southwest Tallahassee neighborhood reporter. I'm finding out about this new fire station, and what's next. \"It was blazing everywhere; it was so big. It was blazing so high, it was heat coming from the building, I'm glad no kids were in there.\" Ronald Mills is a Southwest Tallahassee neighbor. I had him explain the scene of a fire he saw one time in his area. \"A fire can go fast and it's the summertime now…\" Now there's something coming to the neighborhood when those fires occur. It's called Fire Station 17. Wednesday, city leaders voted in favor of funding up to $27 million for the project. That money would come from the City of Tallahassee, Florida Improvement Revenue Note. It's a project that been in development for years. \"It will be a faster response!\" A fast response is the idea. The new development is designed to enhance public safety and reduce response times within National Fire Protection standards in an under-served area that experiences 5,000 calls a year. I asked city commissioner and strong advocate of the new station, Curtis Richardson, if the new fire station were in the Southwest Tallahassee neighborhood would benefit people living here. \"We hear the sirens all the time along Orange Avenue; Lake Bradford road. We just pray that the best happens out of that. But with this facility in our neighborhood near where we live. The chances of a positive outcome would be so much better.\" The new fire station is planned to be located at the former site of the city-owned wastewater treatment facility on 1815 Lake Bradford Rd. Leaving neighbors like Mills confident in enhancing his community. \"I think it's a good time, they know what they're doing!\" The City of Tallahassee tells me that the director of construction for this development confirmed a start date of early 2025. The completion should be around the middle of 2026. In Southwest Tallahassee, Terry Gilliam, ABC27.",
