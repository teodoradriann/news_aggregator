    "text": "Une grève prévue jeudi chez BNP Paribas Fortis : le syndicat exige l’abandon d’un projet\nLes syndicats de BNP Paribas Fortis appellent le personnel de la banque à débrayer le 3 avril prochain. L’information, rapportée par De Standaard, a été confirmée par Herwig Van Doorsselaer, du syndicat socialiste Setca.\nLes syndicats continuent de s’opposer au projet de la direction qui prévoit de transférer quelque 580 employés du service clientèle vers la société externe Accenture. Ils exigent l’abandon de ce projet, alors que le CEO, Michael Anseeuw, a affirmé son intention de le poursuivre plus tôt ce mois-ci. Il a invoqué une convention collective de travail garantissant les droits des employés en cas de transfert.\nAprès plusieurs semaines de menaces, les syndicats ont donc décidé de passer à l’action jeudi prochain. L’appel à la grève concerne l’ensemble du personnel, mais M. Van Doorsselaer ne prévoit pas d’impact sur l’activité des agences bancaires. Le mouvement social devrait principalement concerner le siège social bruxellois et les bureaux d’Anvers, Gand, Louvain, Charleroi et Liège, où travaillent les employés concernés.\nContenus sponsorisés\nNotre sélection vidéo\nCommentaires\nVous souhaitez interagir sur cet article ?\nConnectez-vous et publiez votre commentaire.\nSe connecter\nPas encore de compte ?

    "text": "Brent Venables and his team are putting the finishing touches on preparation for their second game of the 2024 season. After a 48-point win over Temple , OU readies to host the Big 12’s Houston Cougars.\nThe Cougars are the first Big 12 team Oklahoma will face since moving to the SEC. The two teams have played twice in the last decade , with each side picking up a win.\nIn week one, Oklahoma struggled on 3rd down, going just 1/12 on the evening. The defense, however, suffocated the Owls. Offensive line play was a focus of much post-game hoopla, and rightfully so; the Sooners struggled to run the ball, and the depth at receiver was called into action. Most probably weren’t expected to contribute in 2024, but injuries have forced Emmett Jones’s hand.\nWillie Fritz left Tulane to take the job at Houston, and his team will be ready to play after a disappointing performance against UNLV.\nOklahoma should be able to win the game convincingly, but the Sooners can’t get caught napping, or things could get weird quickly.\nBelow, we compiled our three keys to a Sooners victory.\nEstablish the line of scrimmage This is a direct message to Bill Bedenbaugh and his offensive line. The big boys up front have been in a battle all offseason to decide who would earn snaps. And as the games go by, the Sooners need to be putting their five best out there so they can gel.\nProjected starter at right tackle Jake Taylor looks ready to suit up. Though we haven’t yet seen what Taylor’s capable of as a starting offensive lineman at the collegiate level, with a four-star pedigree, there are high hopes for the 2022 signee.\nThe Sooners need to come out and let the Cougars know that whatever ideas and inspiration they might have gleaned from the film against Temple will not work. The running game should pop much more often than it did in the first half of their week one win.\nUp Next: 2 More Keys to Victory",

    "text": "Authorities say the community of Wedderburn in central Victoria are feeling relieved today after a man and his dog were rescued from a vehicle trapped in flood waters.\nSergeant Benjamin Huisman said he was off-duty when he came across the incident.\n\"It was an extremely close call,\" Sergeant Huisman said.\n\"[The driver] was heading home and unfortunately chose to drive through the flood waters.\"\nThe driver's car was swept off the road and carried by floodwaters about 500 metres down the creek. ( ABC News: Emma D'Agostino )\n\"The water was about 3-4 feet deep and flowing extremely fast. It rose up very quickly, before sweeping his car into the creek.\"\n\"He was up to his chin in floodwaters and his dog was in there with him.\"\nSergeant Huisman said that after assessing the situation, he reported to the police station to grab a radio and headed back down to the site to assist community members trying to rescue the man.\n\"Members of the community assisted in getting him out, with the help of SES,\" he said.\n\"They threw a rope to him, then waded into the flood waters and dragged him out onto dry land.\"\nThe driver was treated for hypothermia, Sergeant Huisman confirmed, but will otherwise be fine.\nThe driver's dog is also safe and well.\nLoading... \"Under no circumstances do police, SES or fire services want people driving into floodwaters,\" Sergeant Huisman said.\n\"You don't know what damage has been done to the road, you don't know how fast the water is travelling and you don't know how deep the water is.\n\"You could put your own life at risk, and also those that are there to assist.\"\nMore severe weather to come Victorians are being warned to brace for more wild weather as storms persist across the state this evening.\nA severe thunderstorm warning issued by the Bureau of Meteorology just after 3pm warned of damaging winds and heavy rainfall accompanying isolated storms.\nThe warning follows on from Tuesday's severe weather, which saw large parts of Victoria being faced with torrential rain, destructive winds, hailstones and widespread electrical outages — with around 28,000 homes losing power.\nWangaratta was among many Victorian towns faced with flash floods and winds of up to 104kmh. ( Supplied: Facebook )\nThe SES has responded to more than 980 call-outs for assistance within the last 24 hours.\nThe Bureau warns that the risk of severe storms could carry on into Thursday, with southern and central areas of New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria most likely to be affected.\nPosted 1h ago 1 hours ago Wed 3 Jan 2024 at 6:09am Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)",

    "text": "Risacher, who doesn’t turn 20 until April 8, tied Rockets guard Jalen Green (4) for third in NBA history among teenagers with the most games with 20 or more points scored and five-plus 3-pointers made, according to Stat Mamba. Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards (8) and Grizzlies forward GG Jackson (5) are the others.\n“I feel like every game I feel more comfortable. I’m able to learn like every possession,” Risacher said.\n“Honestly, it’s a new environment. I got great teammates, too. They helped me a lot on the court and off the court, and I’m just in great condition to learn, with, like, the coaches, my teammates, the organization.We’re playing a lot of games, so it’s like it’s great for young player like me to be able to compete every night with those guys.”Mike Curtis: Asked Jason Kidd about possible benchmarks that Anthony Davis needs to clear before he’s able to play: “He’s trending in the right place. He had a positive experience in the practice. He’ll continue to do things this week.\nHopefully the outcome continues to be positive. A lot of good things, but he’s still some time away for him being in a game.”Keith Pompey:\n#Sixers guard/forward Kelly Oubre Jr. (right knee sprain) will miss tonight’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.Guerschon Yabusele (right knee soreness) is still questionable and his status will be determined after his pregame workout.James L Edwards III:\nThibs said Mitchell Robinson will play.Danny Cunningham: The\nKings have ruled out Zach LaVine tonight against the #Cavs.He will miss the game due to personal reasons.\nWlahmir Marques (1937-2025)\nInternational basketball has lost one of its great legends with FIBA Hall of Fame forward Wlamir Marques having passed away. Nicknamed the Flying Saucer and also the Blond Devil, Marques died in a Sao Paulo hospital. He was 87.\nMarch 19, 2025 | 5:58 pm EDT Update\nBeau Estes on being calling the GOATmentator: 'I've had a dream come true, and I'm very luck for that'\nLastly, what are your thoughts on the NBA internet community calling you the GOATmentator? Beau Estes: I don’t walk into negotiations with Turner Sports and say look right here, I’m the GOATmentator, pay me $10 million. I know it’s not bad right? Like it’s just not but it is something very nice and I know when I die, the one thing I’ll be known for is these Top 10, and that GOATmentator thing, and I’m OK with that. That’s very much what a young Beau Estes would have dreamed about.\nBeing known to be an announcer with the NBA would have been a dream come true. I’ve lived it. I’ve had a dream come true and I’m very lucky for that.Beau Estes: We’re in competition with everyone who’s putting out creative and great content on the internet and on social right away. We’re not gonna win every eye, so it’s a challenge to do something great, unique, and again this is where I think if we do something unique – like I try to do with the Top 10 – we’re in an advantage because you can only find that where only we do that. But it certainly makes our challenge greater, right? You look out there and look at the amount of incredibly talented people who are doing content with the NBA, not just fun stuff like I do, but in great analysis, fantasy breakdowns of games and stuff like that. It’s just a real challenge, and to take that a step further, what makes it really interesting is if you’re a television programmer – like ours or ESPN – what do you put out there because you need to get as many eyes as possible on it.",

    "text": "L'un des moyens d'y parvenir est de procéder à des départs de joueurs. Des économies sur les salaires permettraient de faire un grand pas en avant, surtout si l'on tient compte du fait que de nombreux joueurs de l'équipe première doivent encore s'inscrire en Liga, en plus d'éventuelles nouvelles recrues.\nL'article continue ci-dessous Clément Lenglet est l'un des joueurs dont le FC Barcelone veut absolument se séparer. Le défenseur central français n'entre pas dans les plans de Hansi Flick, qui lui cherche une autre porte de sortie. Les Catalans devront se contenter d'un troisième prêt en trois ans, car il n'y a pas suffisamment d'intérêt pour une vente permanente.\nProchain match: Jeux d'amitié des clubs MCI BAR Présentation du match Besiktas est très intéressé par la signature de Lenglet pour la saison 2024-25, et selon Diario AS, il négocie déjà avec Barcelone. Ils sont prêts à payer la moitié du salaire annuel de 6 millions d'euros de Lenglet, mais sans qu'aucune indemnité de prêt ne soit ajoutée. Ils sont également intéressés par l'ancien défenseur de l'Atletico Madrid, Mario Hermoso, qui est actuellement un agent libre.\nLes conditions proposées par Besiktas sont les mêmes que celles que Barcelone a acceptées de Tottenham Hotspur et d'Aston Villa au cours des deux derniers étés. Il est donc probable que le FC Barcelone donne son feu vert à cette transaction.\nPublicité",

    "text": "[Biden-Harris Deep Fake Administration](/Subjects/00774-LAST-biden-harris-deep-fake-administration.htm)\n• https://joepags.com, By Joe Pags Staff\nBIDEN'S DOJ SEND OUT MEMO TO JUDGES ASKING TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON ILLEGAL...\nBiden's Department of Justice sent out a recent memo asking immigration judges to \"treat cases involving migrants under the age of 21 as part of a child docket that loosens restrictions on court absences\" reports the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nThe memo, which was issued December 21st, directs judges to handle cases involving migrants below the age of 21 with less scrutiny and give them second chances if they fail to show up to their court appearances as part of a new \"juvenile docket\".\nThe department and proponents say the creation of a juvenile docket will help address mounting concerns of human trafficking involving children entering the country illegally, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\"Juvenile points of contact will be trained to recognize common indicators of these crimes in order to seek engagement by our ICE colleagues to provide protection and support to these children when needed, while ensuring fair adjudication of their cases before the court. This new initiative is for the well-being of children throughout their immigration proceedings,\" ICE Principal Legal Advisor Kerry E. Doyle said in a statement regarding the program.\nIn cases where a child shows signs that they're a victim of trafficking, abuse and neglect, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) \"may\" open a probe into the matter, according to the memo.\nCritics, however, say this is a Biden administration ruse. \"The administration gives the impression it is concerned about the interests of children in our immigration system, mandating, for example, that ICE attorneys 'will' request a 30-day continuance when children fail to appear in court. But I notice that in the same document, the administration writes only that DHS and HHS 'may' initiate investigations into potential trafficking, abuse, or neglect,\" former ICE Chief of Staff under the Trump administration Jon Feere, who now serves as the director of investigations for the Center for Immigration Studies, told the DCNF.",

    "title": "Holiday hopes, changing traditions — People share what means the most this holiday season and for 2024 - CBS Minnesota",
    "text": "Bethlehem's public Christmas events for 2023 are canceled.\nThe birthplace of Jesus dimmed is perhaps a symbol. The message from local officials: There's less to celebrate this year.\nPeople of a variety of backgrounds and across faith traditions who spoke with CBS News about the holidays shared the many different ways they observe the holiday season. They all reflected on a few themes: unity, family, faith and hope, even as many noted conflict and issues causing deep divisions in the U.S. and across the globe that are casting a cloud over the normally joyful season.\nRenan Marinho, a pastor who most recently preached in Madison, Wisconsin, is focused on taking faith into 2024 as he prepares for Christmas celebrations at his new nondenominational Christian church in Florida.\n\"This holiday season, first of all, is having the manifestation of celebrating Jesus' birth,\" Marinho said.\n\"But the biggest reflection actually starts to happen when you go into New Year's Eve, into the New Year — because this is the moment where Christians get into a sense of being able to bring into the new season God with them in their side.\"\n\"Every aspect of my life this holiday is different,\" said Shai Mizrahi Nessim. The 26-year-old artist wore a metal decal around her neck for this interview with \"bring them back home\" edged onto it.\n\"We never appreciated so much having Hanukkah, so we can have the opportunity to long for miracles to have our hostages back home.\"\nNessim is keeping three things in mind during the holiday season: honoring her religion, creating unity and leading with empathy.\n\"It's something that maybe I'm going to have it more present than always because we never know what people are going through. This has been a very rough year for everybody,\" Nessim said.\n\"The Jewish Panamanian community, we stand strong with Israel, we stand strong with the IDF. We stand strong with all the families that are mourning around the world, and of innocent civilians, Palestinians too.\"\nOn this global holiday, Ruben Garcia, draws parallels to the Nativity story, alluding to Mary and Joseph's plight to find shelter before Jesus' birth.\nNow 75, Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, in El Paso, Texas, has helped immigrants since 1978.\n\"This time of Christmas, of the New Year, for them, it is an acknowledgment that God has allowed them to reach the border to arrive at the United States,\" Garcia said.\nAnnunciation House will continue to arrange some rarities on Christmas for people crossing the border in search of a brighter future: A meal with chicken, gifts for the children and blankets for the adults.\n\"You can't imagine how special that is for refugees who, as they cross through Mexico, oftentimes slept on the ground with literally nothing to cover themselves,\" Garcia said.\n\"It can be very, very moving to receive a gift.\"\nRoza Tawil, a lawyer with roots in Chicago, is one of many who put gifts in stark perspective this year.\n\"The people in Gaza are gonna tell you, 'My wish list is water,'\" Tawil said. \"My wish list is antibiotics, my wish list is food because they're starving.\"\nTawil, whose family is Palestinian and lives in the West Bank, says she feels like she lost a tooth – a hollow void she can't stop rubbing her tongue over.\nThe unfathomable loss of property, life, memories — \"It's just, it's so completely dystopian,\" Tawil said.\n\"When you can't see yourself in that person anymore, because their tragedy is just so extreme. It's beyond recognition to you, you start to think of it as fiction almost, and you no longer resonate with them.\"\nTawil's family in the West Bank is Muslim and usually volunteers with the Christmas festivities in the Holy Land, as do Palestinians of different religions. There's camaraderie among the Palestinian Muslims and Christians in Bethlehem, she said — during Ramadan, Christians will wake up their Muslim neighbors to eat before sunup and the fast begins.\n\"You bring both together to create a full circle of what it really means to be in the holy place,\" she said.\nBut this year, with public Christmas celebrations canceled because of the conflict in Gaza and in solidarity, they won't be volunteering.\nTo many, unity during the holidays means connecting with family.\nSeph MacAndrew, 26, was raised in a nondenominational church, but now honors Christmas traditions outside of religion, seeing as holy the holiday moments shared — laughter, watching movies together and distributing their father's holiday tips from his job as a postal carrier, which the family calls \"second Christmas.\"\n\"We always look forward to that because everyone loves cash,\" MacAndrew said.\nIt's those little things that bring Christmas and the growing family together — MacAndrew has 11 nieces and nephews, and a sister who is pregnant — and \"Every Christmas, that builds into the junk drawer of traditions that we have.\"\nThose kinds of small happenings can help people in the LGBTQ+ community move Christmas from a more capitalist, heteronormative, religious celebration to a more individually meaningful one, says MacAndrew, who identifies as queer.\n\"Renew and regroup what Christmas means to you,\" McAndrew said about holiday traditions. \"Which sounds so Hallmark and corny, but having that meaning for yourself individually, whether it's new traditions or even just like, you know, finding new ways to celebrate.\"\nMacAndrew's holiday celebrations keep changing, and in 2024, so will the tips: \"My dad's gonna be retiring next year.\"\nFor Roni Mosakowski, this holiday will not be huge.\n\"I'm not physically with most of my family, whether it's to distance or loss,\" the New York resident told CBS News.\nShe will celebrate with her daughters, finding ways to incorporate their memories of her husband Sam, who died in 2015.\n\"We tend to make it special by acknowledging the people that aren't there to decorate and celebrate with us,\" Mosakowski said. \"So we have ornaments with pictures of my late husband.\"\nSammy, Mosakowski's oldest daughter, takes the lead on memorializing her dad during the holidays. She still hangs his stocking, which is filled with new Christmas cards, in her bedroom.\n\"We've started to kind of add in things that are less painful for me,\" her mother said. \"Not as much of the old things that trigger my memories, but more of the new things that we now do to celebrate and incorporate him.\"\nNew additions — and new traditions — remain constant for many during the holidays.\nThis year, Leela Harpur Heyder and Gunther Heyder became parents to now-7-month-old Zahara. On Christmas, they wanted to turn a gift into an experience and a memory, Harpur Hayder said.\n\"We're basically taking a pause for the three of us to be together in a van and travel around New Zealand, North Island and South Island, getting out in nature as much as we can and just being together,\" Harpur Heyder said.\nThe Heyders, together for 10 years, don't want to grow old waiting for moments that make for lasting memories.\n\"The main focus of this trip is just to spend time with each other, be present and just hopefully surf away, catch some fish and hike some beautiful sceneries,\" Heyder said.\nAnd for many people, coming together for the holidays means around the table, over traditional foods. For Francisco Treviño, who runs a Hispanic cultural center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that's tamales, buñuelos — sweet fried treats — and champurrado, a type of hot chocolate.\nThe holiday treats take him back to when he was a child in Mexico, he said — and are part of the traditions he's trying to pass on to his community's children, which include the posadas celebrations.\n\"We sit them down and explain to them why we do las posadas and of course, without missing the true significance of celebrating las posadas.\"\nPosadas celebrates Mary and Joseph's journey to Bethlehem during December. The massive events ignite the holiday season for families across Latin America, which lasts through Jan. 6 for some, known as Epiphany or Dia de los Reyes, the day of the three wise men, known as Los Tres Reyes Magos.\nIn Mexico, Spain and many other countries, families exchange presents then, commemorating the gifts given to Jesus in the Nativity story.",
