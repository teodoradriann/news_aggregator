    "title": "ITV Coronation Street fans say 'hasn't changed' as legendary character appears 13 years after death",
    "text": "Coronation Street fans were stunned by the ageless looks of legendary star Steven Arnold - who played butcher Ashley Peacock - as he appeared 13 years after his character's death on The Big Soap Quiz: [Coronation Street](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street) v [Emmerdale](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/emmerdale). Stephen Mulhern was hosting the [ITV](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/itv) show as stars from the two soaps went head to head to discover who knew the most about their show. Steven, 49, was the answer to one of the questions and appeared in the studio to the delight of soap fans. And viewers were shocked to see he hadn't changed much at all since his days playing the much-loved butcher. Steven first appeared on the cobbles as Ashley in 1995. His character was killed off in 2010 when he was a victim of a tram crash as part of the show's 50th-anniversary special episode.

But he was raised by Fred's sister Beryl Peacock, played by Anny Tobin, and her husband Sam as their own son. Ashley grew up believing Fred was his uncle and Beryl was his mother. But viewers were distracted by his youthful appearance and took to X, formerly Twitter, to comment. Dawn said: \"Ashley has not changed at all.\" Simon Ramsay agreed: \"Stephen Arnold/Ashley hasn't changed much considering the number of years, and Malandra Burrows looks stunning! I hope she's well #TheBigQuiz #Emmerdale #Corrie.\" Speaking about his time on the show, Steven said being partnered with John was 'the best thing', adding 'he taught me everything I know'. He added: \"I did 15 years and if you're in a programme for that length of time it's always going to be in your heart.\" Since leaving Coronation Street in 2010, Steven has enjoyed more success in several different TV roles, while also working as a producer. However, he has since found his passion on stage, after working more than ‘40-odd stage jobs’. He appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2011 and has also appeared in Casualty as well as Thick As Thieves and On The Market, and he has worked on countless short films since leaving Coronation Street. And Corrie wasn't his first acting role. Steven and his younger brother, Kevin, both appeared in the Granada Television series Children's Ward.",

    "text": "CNA Staff, May 31, 2024 / 06:00 am Marching under a brutal south Texas sun, Charlie McCullough stopped this week to briefly talk to a young bystander as the southern route of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage passed through Victoria. The twentysomething man, who grew up Protestant and in the foster care system, had lots of questions for McCullough about what this large group of Catholics was doing, and why. Later on, McCullough said he encountered the young man again — he told him he had not only been inspired to pray for the first time in years, but he also wanted to continue to accompany the pilgrimage, despite not yet being Catholic. McCullough, who is one of the 23 young men and women accompanying the Eucharist all the way to Indianapolis, said although he doesn’t expect to see the young man again in this life, he hopes to reunite with him one day in heaven. “On pilgrimage, it’s so easy to see the best in people,” McCullough said at a Wednesday press conference with several fellow Perpetual Pilgrims, adding that he believes it is “the presence of the Lord bringing out the best in people.” The Juan Diego Route, the southernmost of the four, began in Brownsville, Texas , and has included many distinctly Hispanic expressions of Catholicism.",

    "text": "UK-based Arksen has carved out a unique niche in the adventure travel world. Originally builders of aluminum-hulled ocean-going vessels for patrolling the very ends of the world’s seas, in 2023, they branched out into\nbespoke overland vehicles based on the original Land Rover Defender and Mercedes Unimog. This lineup even includes an EV version of the Defender 110. With design and build facilities on three continents, Arksen’s mission is to create an “ecosystem of adventure products and experiences” across the board. Their new line of apparel, Arksen Labs, launched earlier this year.\nArksen’s founder, Jasper Smith, says, “Our vision… has always been to build the ultimate adventure company [and] to create… the cross-over between performance [and] luxury for the most discerning customers and the most remote destinations on land or at sea. Arksen Overland and Arksen Labs performance wear represent critical steps on our journey towards that ecosystem, and there will be more to come in 2024.”\nDesigned “for both wilderness and urban adventures,” Arksen claims to use the world’s most advanced fabrics in their apparel line for Autumn and Winter 2023. Made in Europe from over 95% recycled materials and engineered for durability, longevity, and versatility, the Arksen Labs collection includes base layers and t-shirts, mid-weight layers, shells, and outerwear for extreme conditions.\nThe\nObex 3L waterproof jacket should be at home on deck or even at the wettest of camps. The Obex features recycled 3L Schoeller C-Change fabric and fully seam-taped waterproof construction, including waterproof zippers, and weighs in at a feathery 800 grams. Paired with either the Triton insulated jacket or the Lentus down jacket, this outerwear system will take on the worst winter has to throw at you.\nFor more on Arksen’s custom-built overland vehicles, cutting-edge marine engineering, and the Arksen Labs apparel line, visit Arksen’s\nwebsite.\n£695.00 |\nObex 3L Jacket\n£550.00 |\nLentus Down Jacket\n£495.00 |\nTriton Insulated Jacket\nRead more:\nAether Fall Collection :: Field Tested\nOur No Compromise Clause: We do not accept advertorial content or allow advertising to influence our coverage, and our contributors are guaranteed editorial independence.

Na publicação feita na última quarta-feira, 18, o cantor e compositor explicou que passou por uma cirurgia para retirar um melanoma, tumor na pele que deixa uma cor escura na região em que se encontra.\nEle já havia enfrentado um câncer de pele alguns anos atrás. Em seu relato, Julian disse que viajou a Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos, a trabalho e aproveitou para se consultar com o oncologista que o atendeu da primeira vez. \"Foi ele que diagnosticou e operou meu câncer de pele e, literalmente, salvou minha vida, escreveu.\nApós sair de uma entrevista, o músico recebeu uma ligação urgente do médico. \"Tinha sinais de câncer de pele em dois locais, no meu ombro e no antebraço, um deles era um melanoma e precisava ser operado o mais rápido possível.\"\nEle garantiu que a cirurgia foi um sucesso, mas que ainda espera o resultado da biópsia, que pode ser disponibilizado até o Natal. \"Em vez de ir para casa montar minha árvore de Natal e terminar o ano tranquilamente relaxando em casa, voei de volta para Los Angeles e passei por uma cirurgia na qual passaram horas me operando e limpando a região\", disse.\nVeja também\n“Queria ficar com ele”, diz madrasta de criança autista de 2 anos agredida pelo pai\nAna Hickmann está fazendo tratamento para engravidar de Edu Guedes, diz colunista\nBand exibe especial de Natal com Ana Castela Tópicos relacionados Entretenimento Estadão",
