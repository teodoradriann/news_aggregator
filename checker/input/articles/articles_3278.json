    "text": "PENNSYLVANIA — A recent drug arrest in Altoona has led to the capture of a man authorities believe was supplying heroin and methamphetamine in the area. Nathan Robert Croyle, 43, was arrested on April 8 following an investigation by the Altoona Police Department and the Blair County Drug Taskforce into suspected drug trafficking in the city. According to police, officers were conducting surveillance near 27th Street and Maple Avenue and observed several individuals leaving a residence later identified as Croyle’s. Multiple traffic stops were made, including one involving 30-year-old Jayson Riscigno, who police said had been dropped off at the front of the home and exited through the back. During the stop, officers discovered Riscigno had an active warrant through the Blair County Sheriff’s Office. A search of his person reportedly uncovered heroin and crystal methamphetamine. Following Riscigno’s arrest, investigators obtained a search warrant for Croyle’s home. The warrant was executed by a team that included Altoona police, Logan Township police, Tyrone police, Pennsylvania State Police, detectives from the Blair County District Attorney’s Office, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office. Croyle was found in the basement and taken into custody without incident. During the search, officers reported finding 32 packets of suspected heroin with a street value of $640 on top of an air duct in the basement. Croyle is currently being held in Blair County Prison on $150,000 bail. According to a criminal complaint, Croyle was also identified as the “unknown Black male on a bicycle” accused of selling heroin to a man involved in a previous controlled buy. Riscigno, who was taken to prison on his outstanding warrant, will also face drug charges in connection to the investigation, police said.

    "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 24 October 2024 04:53 PM EDT Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe some form of political violence will occur after November's election, a Scripps News/Ipsos poll released Thursday found. The national survey of 1,028 adults aged 18 and over conducted Oct. 18-20 found that 62% — including 70% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans — said it is very or somewhat likely that there will be violence related to political outcomes following Election Day on Nov. 5. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points. Also, 51% said they strongly or somewhat support using the military to stop any threat of potential violence around Election Day, with 30% strongly or somewhat opposed. Still, 63% said they were very or somewhat confident that all votes will be accurately counted in the election, with 77% saying they were willing to accept if their preferred candidate loses. But 18% of Republicans and 8% of Democrats said they would not commit to accepting the results. The poll found that 84% believe in-person voting on Election Day is very or somewhat secure from fraud, but the numbers drop significantly regarding mail-in voting or using drop boxes to collect ballots. Just 54% believe mail-in voting is very or somewhat secure from fraud, including 38% of Republicans and 51% of independents. About one-third of Republicans and 49% of independents say ballot drop boxes are secure from fraud.
