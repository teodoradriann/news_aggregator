Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish.

Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion.\n– Gwent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries.\n– Hampshire & Isle of Wight\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4\n– Hertfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record.\n– Humberside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2\n– Kent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6\nThe force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.

The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures.\n– Northumbria\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim.\n– Nottinghamshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19\nThe force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker.\n– South Wales\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9\nThe force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”.\n– Suffolk\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0\n– Surrey\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10\nThe force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member.\n– Thames Valley\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20\n– Warwickshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: No information held\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods.\n– West Mercia\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4\n– West Midlands\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”.\n– West Yorkshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49\nThe force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted.

    "title": "Streaming bundling gains traction as viewers cut back, TiVo study finds",
    "text": "Consumers are adjusting their entertainment habits in response to industry changes and economic pressures, according to TiVo’s Q2 “2024 Video Trends Report.” The report indicates a clear trend toward bundled services, as many consumers prefer this option over increasing subscription fees.\nEntertainment consumption surged during the pandemic, but now consumers are scaling back. Spending on entertainment has dropped by $30 year-over-year, and the average number of services used has decreased from 10.9 in 2023 to 9.1 in 2024. Despite these cuts, the report notes that overall viewing habits remain consistent. This suggests that while budgets may be tighter, consumers are finding ways to maintain access to entertainment through alternatives like ad-supported services.\nA notable shift is that 64% of consumers now use ad-supported subscription video-on-demand (AVOD) tiers, a 16-point increase from the previous year.\n“In the past, we’ve seen over-the-top (OTT) service providers trying to assess the limits of consumer entertainment spending, and they are now seeing where consumers are willing to draw the line,” said Scott Maddux, vice president of global content strategy and business at Xperi.\n“Now, the same OTT service providers are starting to see the promotional and monetary benefits of creating bundles with their subscription video on demand, ad-supported video on demand and free ad-supported television service options, helping to reduce churn and, more importantly, keep their customers under one roof rather than spread across multiple broadband and pay TV services, allowing content providers to monetize across the full spectrum from subscription to ad-supported.”\nThe report highlights that major media companies are responding by bundling AVOD and free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) services with their traditional SVOD offerings. This approach is becoming a successful business model, reducing churn and helping customers consolidate their services.\nAdditionally, broadband providers offering streaming bundles benefit, with 62% of respondents stating they would likely keep their internet service if it included additional streaming services. As a result, the bundling of broadband and streaming services is emerging as a key strategy in the evolving entertainment market.\nConsumers are also becoming more tolerant of ads, as long as they feel they are getting good value. The quality of ads on AVOD and FAST platforms has improved, making the experience more acceptable for viewers. This shift in consumer behavior shows that with the right balance, bundled ad-supported services are gaining wider acceptance.\nNearly 85% of respondents shared that they are prone to browsing before they land on a show or movie to watch, and almost 73% shared that they go into more than one app in a typical viewing session to settle on an entertainment option. The relevance of content recommendations has decreased across the board, with respondents still finding organic recommendations to be more relevant than other forms of recommendations. Top methods of discovery continue to be word-of-mouth/recommendations from friends (50%) and commercials or ads that run during other shows (40%). Almost 80% of respondents watch video via their social media and/or user-generated content networks; this is a slight decline from 85% in the spring of 2023. Top video sources include YouTube followed by TikTok. The share of pay TV subscribers utilizing transactional video on demand (TVOD) services has declined substantially, from 54.3% in Q2 2023 down to 45.7% this year. Broadband-only subscribers’ TVOD usage has remained consistent, at 41.3%, compared to 41.9% in Q2 2023. Amazon Prime still leads as the top TVOD service with YouTube following in its footsteps.",

    "text": "(Adnkronos) - Roma, sabato 12 Ottobre 2024\nAddio maltempo, sull'Italia sta arrivando l’alta pressione che porterà temperature miti da Nord a Sud regalandoci una calda ottobrata, soprattutto a partire da lunedì. Mattia Gussoni, meteorologo de iLMeteo.it, conferma dunque il deciso miglioramento delle condizioni meteo sul nostro Paese, dopo 10 giorni di continue piogge al Centro-Nord.\nNelle prossime ore avremo prevalenza di sole, ma non mancheranno delle insidie: il cielo sarà più nuvoloso su Piemonte poi su Liguria, Valle d’Aosta e Lombardia occidentale; dal pomeriggio qualche addensamento non è escluso anche su Appennini, Alpi orientali ed Alta Toscana. Altrove il sole sarà dominante e le temperature massime saranno gradevoli: al Nord tra i 18°C e i 23°C, al Centro tra i 21°C e i 25°C, al Sud tra i 23°C e i 28°C.\nDomenica 13 ottobre sarà ancora più soleggiata: il cielo sarà in prevalenza sereno salvo nubi medio-basse su Piemonte meridionale e Friuli Venezia Giulia, specie al mattino. Durante tutto il weekend non sono attese precipitazioni se non qualche piovasco sabato su Valle d’Aosta, Alto Piemonte, Alta Lombardia e Liguria (qui effimero).\nLa nuova settimana si aprirà poi con una situazione ancora simile: avremo tanto sole al Centro-Sud, qualche insidia al Nord. Lunedì è previsto un aumento della nuvolosità sul settentrione con la possibilità di isolata pioviggine, più probabile al Nord-Ovest, ma in realtà il tempo resterà piuttosto stabile e soleggiato quasi ovunque.\nIn tendenza si profila dalla prossima settimana un campo di alta pressione sul nostro Paese, circondato a destra e sinistra da due zone cicloniche, una sulla Spagna ed una sulla Turchia.\nGuardando le mappe meteo previste per la prossima settimana, appare dunque un disegno ad Omega, una figura molto difficile da scalzare e da mutare nel breve termine. In altre parole è probabile che avremo molte piogge sulla Penisola Iberica e sulla Turchia, mentre l’Italia sarà baciata dal sole per più giorni (qualche insidia potrebbe arrivare solo sul fianco più occidentale, da confermare).\nE con il Blocco ad Omega l’Italia vivrà molto probabilmente una bella e lunga Ottobrata, quella fase soleggiata e a tratti calda caratteristica dell’Autunno italiano. Sono previste massime fino a 30°C al Sud e 26-27°C anche a Roma e Firenze! Benvenuta Ottobrata.\nNEL DETTAGLIO\nSabato 12. Al Nord: nuvoloso. Al Centro: soleggiato. Al Sud: soleggiato.\nDomenica 13. Al Nord: nubi irregolari. Al Centro: via via più nuvoloso. Al Sud: bel tempo.\nLunedì 14. Al Nord: piovaschi a ovest. Al Centro: poco nuvoloso. Al Sud: bel tempo.\nTendenza: rinforzo dell’anticiclone con una bella Ottobrata, un po’ più incerto al Nord.",
