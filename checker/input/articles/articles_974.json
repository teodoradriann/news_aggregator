    "title": "Report: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Former NFL quarterback and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich is joining the coaching staff under Deion Sanders at Colorado, Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The reports come a day after Leftwich was spotted at practice holding a clipboard and wearing Colorado football gear. Sanders said on Monday Colorado would make \"a couple more huge moves\" this week but has not confirmed Leftwich's hiring. It's unclear what Leftwich's role will be on Sanders' staff. Leftwich interviewed with the New England Patriots for their head coaching post in January. Leftwich, 45, most recently worked as the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2019-22, a stint that included a Super Bowl win in the 2020 season. Leftwich was fired by Bucs head coach Todd Bowles after the 2022 season, which saw Tampa Bay slip from the top 3 in scoring the previous three seasons to No. 15 in yards and No. 25 in points in 2022. A quarterback and first-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2003 NFL Draft, Leftwich had a 24-26 record with 10,532 passing yards and 58 touchdowns in 60 games with the Jaguars (2003-06), Atlanta Falcons (2007), Bucs (2009) and Steelers (2008, 2010, 2012). He also worked in various roles including the interim offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals from 2016-2018. --Field Level Media Subscribe to Ashe Post & Times",

    "text": "The Trump administration plans to cut about 10,000 full-time employees from the Department of Health and Human Services, the department announced Thursday, cutting around a tenth of the staff at the nation's federal health agencies.\n\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration and 2,400 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No FDA inspectors or CDC infectious diseases personnel are getting cut, one U.S. official said.\nThe administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health and 300 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in video annoncement shared Thursday by the department.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news.\nHealth officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping reorganization architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.\nSeveral health agency officials said they had seen stepped up security measures coming into work this morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.\nKennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.\n\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies.\" Kennedy said Monday.\nOne of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"\n\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of department sand agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.\nThe new administration will consolidate work from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxc Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthy \"into a new, unified entity,\" the department said.\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which was elevated into a separate agency under the Biden administration to oversee tasks like the pandemic stockpile, will be abosrbed into the CDC.\nWork from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.\nAnd the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy acknowledged in his remarks.\nDetails of who exactly will be cut from the department within the agencies remain unclear, under the new reorganization plans. As of Thursday morning, multiple federal health officials said they had received little guidance from the department, aside from Kennedy's announcement.\nIn his remarks in the video, Kennedy said that they were \"focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and frontline health providers\" in the changes.\n\"We're going to streamline our agency and eliminate redundancies and invite everyone to align behind a simple, bold mission: I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, 'what can I do to restore American health today,'\" he added.\nIn: FDA CDC Jennifer Jacobs Jennifer Jacobs is a senior White House reporter at CBS News.\nTwitter",

En la mayoría de países de la UE no lo es, no puedes despedir porque patatas. Al ser libre la comisión europea estimó que las indemnizaciones eran insuficientes.\nPero, si lo hacen, las indemnizaciones tiene sentido que sean menores. En Francia por lo que he mirado esta noche este ratito parece que la opción más viable para el despido es la de causas objetivas, algo que en España casi nunca se plantea (aunque sea cierto) porque las posibilidades de que sea despido nulo son tan altas que mejor pagar la indemnización.\n1\nK\n23\n#1\nBarriales\nLos ineptos son los de recursos humanos.\n4\nK\n48\n#2\nDISIENTO\n#1\nprobablemente se llevó una indemnización que le ayudará y el despido era imprescindible.\n6\nK\n58\n#5\ningenierodepalillos\n#2\n¿seguro que no quiso decir improcedente?\n3\nK\n45\n#11\nEstoeslaostia\n#5\nLos de infobae que son muy del clickbait.\n1\nK\n16\n#7\nBarriales\n#2\nlas maneras. Las maneras, son de auténticos hijos de grandisima puta.\n3\nK\n39\n#10\nEstoeslaostia\n*\n#1\nBueno...no creo.\nCon ese tipo de despido se denuncia en la SMAC y se declara improcedente por parte de la empresa.\nSe paga el despido (dinero que NO fiscaliza) y el trabajador se podrá jubilar de modo anticipado si lo necesitase. (JAI: Jubilación anticipada Involuntaria).\nA toda esta \"artimaña\" le queda poquito. Europa ya se está moviendo para evitar estos asuntos.\n4\nK\n48\n#28\nNoviembre_2024\n#10\nEn Francia es bastante más complicado despedir, recursos humanos lo tendría muy bien planteado para poder despedir a alguien con una enfermedad y de sesenta años con cuarenta años trabajados.\nEl despiste ha sido lo de la medalla.\n1\nK\n23\n#3\nPixmac\nFalta información. Sufría de \"agotamiento profesional\" y le ofrecieron puestos en Francia y fuera del país pero ella los rechazó al no ser lo que llevaba haciendo en la empresa. Habría que saber lo que su enfermedad profesional le permitía hacer, que tampoco puedes esperar que la empresa vaya a crear un puesto expresamente hecho para tí. Podrán adaptarte un puesto a tus posibilidades pero no se debe esperar nada más allá.\n2\nK\n34\n#36\nNobby\n#3\nno seré yo quien defienda a una empresa frente a un trabajador, pero existe un concepto llamado \"ineptitud sobrevenida\". Por ejemplo, trabajas moviendo cajas en un almacén, se te cae un palé encima y te quedas tetrapléjico: debido al accidente ya no puedes realizar tu trabajo, eso sería ineptitud sobrevenida.\nDesconozco las secuelas de su enfermedad laboral o cuál era su puesto de trabajo, nos falta información.\nEso sí, lo de \"te echo a la calle y al día siguiente te doy un premio\" no tiene perdón...\n0\nK\n10\n#37\ntheMooche\n#3\nParece que le podrían haber hecho un favor. Al menos entre directivos, es una práctica bastante extendida la de despedirlos cuando les faltan 2 telediarios para la jubilación.\nAunque se ve que se ha mostrado sorprendida...\n0\nK\n6\n#18\nPerefct\nSe me ha helado la sangre al leer los salarios de cada grupo de esta empresa que vienen en la noticia...\n3\nK\n33\n#20\nHangdog\n#18\nSe supone que son mínimos. Yo en la que estoy, que el convenio es sectorial, el mínimo para mi grupo es un poco más del 60% de lo que realmente gano.\nY de otros puestos un escalón o dos más altos, la diferencia crece.\nEso si, para los de base, ahí están.\n0\nK\n15\n#35\nBudgie\n#18\nefectivamente.

    "text": "Moriero: \"Fenomeno, una volta danzò sul ghiaccio. È il miglior numero 9 della storia\"\nIn un'intervista a La Gazzetta dello Sport l'ex calciatore Francesco Moriero ha parlato di una leggenda del calcio mondiale.\nIntervistato in esclusiva da La Gazzetta dello Sport, Francesco Moriero ha ricordato la leggendaria semifinale di Coppa Uefa giocata con l'Inter nel gelo di Mosca: \"Andiamo in campo per il riscaldamento e dopo 5’ torniamo dentro: congelati. L’abbiamo fatto nello spogliatoio, ognuno per sé. Entriamo in campo: avevo messo due magliette sotto la maglia da gara, paraorecchie, paracollo\".\n\"Tutto inutile: piedi congelati, non riuscivo a correre su una melma fatta di fango, segatura e ghiaccio. Stadio strapieno, loro assatanati, segnano dopo dieci minuti. Simeone mi chiama: “Metti più cross che puoi”. “È una parola”, gli rispondo. Dai e ridai mi arriva un pallone sull’esterno, colpisco con la caviglia in freezer, il Cholo non ci arriva di testa ma ci arriva Ronie e però tutti corrono ad abbracciare me: ero riuscito a fare un cross...\" ha continuato l'ex ala di Roma e Inter.\nPoi le parole al miele su Ronaldo: \"In quella partita avrà toccato dieci palloni, ma non correva sul ghiaccio: pattinava. Danzava. Quel gol, leggendario: fa uno stop, dribbla a seguire, chiede l’uno-due a Zamorano che è bravissimo a farsi trovare, una finta delle sue per lasciare lì due difensori, un’altra sul portiere e palla in buca. Tutto in pochi metri, alla sua velocità. Ronie, come cantavano i tifosi, ce l’avevamo noi\".\n\"Per me giocare con lui è stato un privilegio, un onore, e un piacere: il numero uno di quei tempi, per me il miglior “nove” della storia. Il più moderno, dieci anni avanti a tutti, aveva tutto: tecnica, potenza fisica e rapidità, fiuto del gol\" ha concluso Moriero.\nGiuseppe Biscotti\nLaureato in economia aziendale, è giornalista pubblicista dal 2021.

    "text": "Roma, 12 giugno 2025 - Israele sta valutando la possibilità di intraprendere un'azione militare contro l'Iran - molto probabilmente senza il supporto degli Stati Uniti - nei prossimi giorni, nonostante il presidente Donald Trump sia in trattative avanzate con Teheran per un accordo diplomatico volto a limitare il suo programma nucleare. Secondo cinque fonti citate dalla Nbc, Israele sta prendendo sempre più seriamente in considerazione un attacco unilaterale all'Iran, mentre i negoziati tra Stati Uniti e Iran sembrano avvicinarsi a un accordo preliminare o quadro che include disposizioni sull'arricchimento dell'uranio che Israele considera inaccettabili.\nLe notizie in diretta Un uomo cammina davanti a un murale anti-Usa accanto all'ex ambasciata americana a Teheran 06:33 Nbc: Israele valuta un attacco all'Iran nei prossimi giorni Israele sta valutando di lanciare \"nei prossimi giorni\" un'azione militare contro l'Iran, \"molto probabilmente senza il supporto degli Stati Uniti\". E' quanto scrive l'emittente americana Nbc, citando cinque fonti al corrente della situazione, dopo che diversi media Usa hanno riportato che Israele sarebbe pronto a un'operazione in Iran.\nIntervenendo in nottata dal Kennedy Center, Donald Trump ha dichiarato che gli Stati Uniti stanno spostando il personale americano in Medio Oriente a causa di un possibile \"pericolo\" nella regione. \"Vengono spostati perché potrebbe diventare un posto pericoloso\", ha affermato.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",
