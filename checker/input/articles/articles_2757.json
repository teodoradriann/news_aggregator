Often overlooked amidst flashier neighbors, this small, brown bird embodies the very essence of adaptability and perseverance, weaving a captivating story in the heart of our backyards. Let's delve into the life of the song sparrow and discover the secrets it holds. Unlike their vibrantly plumaged counterparts, song sparrows choose subtlety. Their brown and gray feathers, accented with streaks and spots, offer exceptional camouflage amidst leaves and twigs. This seemingly plain outfit isn't a lack of fashion sense; it's a survival strategy, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their environment and evade predators. This is our most common sparrowmuch of the year. Look closely in the nearest shrubs and you'll get lucky before long.",

    "text": "Curious Elixirs—A Perfect Fit For Sober Celebrations?\nThis review is not sponsored and contains the author’s personal experience. The author personally purchased this product. The Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model here.\nAlmost everyone I know is rethinking their relationship to alcohol these days. After our lives were upended in 2020, many of us have settled into new drinking routines that, frankly, can be hard to escape. When I finally caved and downloaded TikTok a few months ago, I was met with even more people who were sober curious. I decided it was time to find an alternative happy hour drink for unwinding after work.\n“I decided it was time to find an alternative happy hour drink for unwinding after work.”\nI’ve known about Curious Elixirs for a few years, ever since the rise of the sober curious lifestyle. The brand was founded in 2015—before I even heard the term “sober curious”—and is on a mission to make the best booze-free cocktails. Curious Elixirs believes these alcohol-free drinks should be “unusually delicious, well-crafted, and good for bodies and souls.” That’s why the ingredients include adaptogens and aphrodisiacs mixed in with other organic ingredients by world-class bartenders and herbalists. (If you’re new to adaptogens, they are nontoxic, body-balancing ingredients that help you cope with physical and mental stress. Yes, please!)\nIt always sounded a little too good to be true, and I’d often return to the brand’s website with one burning question: would they really taste and feel like a suitable alternative to my favorite happy hour bevvies?\n“Would they really taste and feel like a suitable alternative to my favorite happy hour bevvies?”\nI decided to go all-in with the 24-drink variety pack, as my partner and I wanted a new beverage in our rotations. When it arrived, I was initially dismayed that the drinks actually came in 12 standard-sized cans and bottles—I thought it couldn’t possibly be nearly enough. But as we started pouring, it was very reasonable to split a can or bottle, especially when you poured it over ice (hence why a 12-pack of bottles is touted as a 24-drink pack). Each bottle comes with a tip on how best to garnish the cocktail, which is way fancier than I can keep up with! But I do keep more lemons on hand nowadays.\nThe flavors in the variety pack rotate each month based on supply chain availability. Here are the possible flavors you can get, alongside the functions some of their key ingredients have:\n- Curious Elixir No. 1 is a\nPomegranate Negronithat contains rhodiola as a mood booster and pick-me-up. - Curious Elixir No. 2 is a\nSpicy Marg Meets A Dark & Stormythat contains damiana, a Mayan aphrodisiac. - Curious Elixir No. 3 is a\nCucumber Collinsthat contains ashwagandha to support mood and memory. - Curious Elixir No. 4 is a\nSicilian Spritzthat contains rhubarb root for stress relief. - Curious Elixir No. 5 is a\nSmoked Cherry Chocolate Old Fashionedthat contains shatavari, a body-balancing Ayurvedic aphrodisiac. - Curious Elixir No. 6 is a\nCoconut Oatmilk Painkillerthat contains lemon balm and nutmeg for mood boosting and stress relief. - Curious Elixir No. 7 is a\nChampagne Cocktailthat contains Chardonnay grapes, and green tea as a pick-me-up and lavender as a mood booster.\nI’ve been subscribed for a few months and have tried every flavor. So far, my favorites have been numbers two and five. Curious Elixir No. 2 is a tasty margarita alternative, and the ginger and ancho chili makes for an extremely flavorful sip—perfect for drinking on the front porch. Curious Elixir No. 5, a smoked cherry chocolate old fashioned, is ideal if your mood is more “sitting in a housecoat in a large old library while a fire crackles nearby.” The ingredients include oak and chicory, and cacao and elderberry.\nI will say I didn’t love No. 6, the Coconut Oatmilk Painkiller. I added ice, which I think was a bad move for me personally since watered-down plant-based milk is…just yuck. (No oat milk iced coffees for me!) Although, to be fair, the brand suggests that you can drink the cocktail neat, which I’ll try next time.\n“I found myself with a little bit left at the end of the evening and didn’t feel the need to rush through it.”\nThe first night I tried one (a Cucumber Collins), I sipped on it throughout the evening without wanting to chug the whole thing, which I was worried about since these cocktails can be a bit pricey—the best deal is the monthly cocktail club at $89 for 24 servings.\nI found myself with a little bit left at the end of the evening and didn’t feel the need to rush through it. I did tap the brakes for a second since it tasted like a cocktail, and I didn’t want to chug an alcoholic cocktail right before bed. But I reminded myself this was, in fact, the herbs and adaptogens and enjoyed the last bit of it without worrying I’d be groggy in the morning. (The ingredients for this particular cocktail include juniper, ashwagandha, orange blossom, lemon verbena, and angelica).\n“And that’s the beauty of these babies—they don’t make me feel icky the next morning.”\nAnd that’s the beauty of these babies—they don’t make me feel icky the next morning. The cocktails are satisfying enough for one a night. While no refined sugars are included in these cocktails, they can get a little sweet thanks to the fruit juices and, in the case of No. 5, the touch of coconut sugar. But that’s why nearly every cocktail is better poured over ice!\nI’ve come to see my Curious Elixirs moment as a special occasion to mark my day; I sit out on the patio, and people watch the pedestrians and drivers during their hectic evening commute. I fix myself a glass as beautifully as I can (although I rarely have the “orange twist” garnish) and feel calm and scholarly as I imbibe. My partner joins me regularly and tells everyone about the elixirs; I think he might even like them more than I do.\n“Treat it as a self-care moment, whip out your best cocktail glasses and pay close attention to the flavors and to the way the herbs and adaptogens make you feel.”\nI do miss the “third place” of my neighborhood brewery, though, and I will admit I still pop out for a brew once a week. (Hey, it’s sober curious for now.)\nMy biggest recommendation in all this, if you’re hoping to replace a boozy habit, is to make the event actually something special. Treat it as a self-care moment, whip out your best cocktail glasses and pay close attention to the flavors and to the way the herbs and adaptogens make you feel. For me, these cocktails are a wonderful mindfulness tool that I can enjoy slowly and let the swirl of my day come to an end. (Honestly, these would make such a lovely gift and I might bring them along for a housewarming someday.)\n“Whether you’re quitting drinking cold turkey, or just exploring another option for weekdays, go easy on yourself.”\nWhile I haven’t fully replaced my favorite Hazy IPAs with Curious Elixirs, I can certainly envision a day where I’ve built even more booze-free habits in my life. And, for those who might wonder, all but No. 3 are safe for drinking during pregnancy, although you should consult your doctor about all of them just in case.\nWhether you’re quitting drinking cold turkey, or just exploring another option for weekdays, go easy on yourself. The biggest thing is to examine what self-care means to you, and for me, it doesn’t include craft beer as much as it once did. And Curious Elixirs is a lovely, proactive alternative that never makes me feel headachey—or hungover. And I’ll say cheers to that!\nKey Takeaways:\n- While\nCurious Elixirsare more expensive than a 12-pack of beer, you won’t find yourself reaching for one more impulsively and can easily share each bottle with someone (or spin around for seconds, why not!?). - The adaptogens are calming and gave me a slight buzzy, relaxed feeling.\n- The texture of the drinks does have a little sparkle to it, which is nice if you’re swapping out a favorite cocktail! I highly recommend following the garnish recommendations on the bottle.\n- Some of the drinks can be a little “thick” thanks to the organic fruit juices, but nothing a good ice cube can’t fix!\nEmily McGowan is the Editorial Director at The Good Trade.

    "title": "Idaho AG: State Will Prevail as High Court Punts on Abortion Law",
    "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 27 June 2024 07:12 PM EDT Republican Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador said Thursday he is confident about the legal fight ahead after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits of a case challenging the Gem State's abortion restrictions. The unsigned order from the justices in the case of Moyle v. United States leaves in place a ruling by an Idaho federal judge that temporarily blocked the state from enforcing its abortion ban, which has exceptions only to save the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest, to the extent that it conflicts with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). That 1986 federal law requires emergency rooms in hospitals that receive Medicare to provide \"necessary stabilizing treatment\" to patients who arrive with an \"emergency medical condition.\" The order came a day after a draft of the ruling reportedly was \"mistakenly\" published on the Supreme Court's website. The Biden administration sued Idaho in 2022, shortly after the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion, which triggered Idaho's restrictions to take effect. The administration argued that in certain rare and extreme emergencies, abortion could constitute a medically stabilizing treatment under EMTALA and that denying abortions in non-life-threatening medical emergencies violated federal law. Labrador told reporters following the Supreme Court's decision that he is confident the lower courts will dismiss the Biden administration's case. \"I remain committed to protect unborn life and ensure women in Idaho receive necessary medical care, and I will continue my outreach to doctors and hospitals across Idaho to ensure that they understand what our law requires,\" Labrador said, according to the Washington Examiner. \"We look forward to ending this administration's relentless overreach into Idahoans' right to protect and defend life.\" The decision to send the case back to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was supported by three conservative justices — Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice John Roberts — because of concessions made by the Biden administration that the mental health of the mother does not constitute a medical emergency, the Examiner reported. Labrador said because the three other Republican-appointed judges — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch — agreed with his office's interpretation of EMTALA, he is confident the 9th Circuit will rule in Idaho's favor. \"What is clear is that the majority of the Supreme Court understood that either the interpretation of the U.S. government was wrong, as the dissent said, or, as the three conservatives said in their move to go to the 9th Circuit, that the [federal government's] interpretation would have been severely limited by their concessions,\" Labrador said, according to the Examiner. \"So we feel pretty strongly that we're going to win this case in the end.\" Michael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience reporting and editing on news, culture, and politics. © 2024 Newsmax.

There’s a million different things right now that are just not great.”\nWith the trade deadline five days away, and the Blue Jays not meeting expectations of contending, the assumptions have been general manager Ross Atkins will sell off a handful of veteran players in exchange for prospects.\n“You have ideas of who’s not going to be around much longer and a lot of these people mean a lot to you so yeah, it’s not fun,” Bassitt said.\nBassitt admitted he wasn’t sharp before 41,148 at Rogers Centre. He departed after five innings down 3-0 after tossing 97 pitches, giving up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts.\nBut then reliever Trevor Richards entered and was worse. He only faced seven hitters, giving up four runs on four hits and two walks.\n“He’s been really good for us, especially earlier in the year,” Blue Jays manager John Scheider said of Richards. “But he doesn’t have a good feel for his change-up right now.\n“When you have two pitches you have to be good with them. He doesn’t have his command right now and he’s falling behind (in the count).”\nTampa followed its four-run sixth inning by tacking on five more in the seventh.\nErnie Clement and his knuckleball had to be summoned from his third-base position to pitch the ninth and save the bullpen from further depletion. He gave up a run as the Rays pushed their hit total to 16.\nTampa Bay Rays designated hitter Brandon Lowe hits an RBI double off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Chris Bassitt during third inning American League MLB baseball action in Toronto on Thursday, July 25, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young Taj Bradley (6-4) pitched six shutout innings and allowed only two hits, winning his third straight start.\nThe 23-year-old Bradley surrendered a one-out double to left from Spencer Horwitz and an infield hit to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the first inning.\nBut then the Rays righty settled down to retire 11 in a row and 17 of his final 18, allowing only a walk to Danny Jansen in the fifth. Bradley finished with seven strikeouts and a walk.\nBrandon Lowe, Isaac Paredes, Alex Jackson and Amed Rosario were the big offensive producers in the series finale before 41,148 at Rogers Centre.\nLowe sent a 414-foot homer into the fifth deck down the right-field line to open the scoring. He knocked in two more runs with four hits and also twice walked.\nParedes drove in four runs with two hits, while Jackson checked in with three RBI with two hits.

    "title": "#63 Un atentado islamista durante la misa de Navidad deja más de 160 cristianos asesinados en Nigeria",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#53](c53#c-53) ridiculizarlo si quieres.... Pero con Israel tenemos todo tipo de relaciones y bien estrechas, vamos de aliados, van de ser occidente, medio entran en europa, sobre todo socialmente, democracia plena etc etc ... No tiene absolutamente nada que ver.\nEsto es una masacre genocida por supuesto, ejem\n[#2](c2#c-2) .... Pro no es comparable. Si acaso, comparable a la masacre de Hamas.\n[#61](c61#c-61) Con Israel si, con Gaza no, mediáticamente deberíamos estar recibiendo un bombardeo de lavado de cara de Israel, pero es al contrario. Lo que esté bien o mal no me meto, no soy experto, pero la actitud de los medios ha cambiado y eso me inquieta.\nEs como si dentro de un mes encontramos todos los medios diciendo que Aznar ha sido el peor presidente, que hipotecó a España para décadas. Sería inquietante, llevan décadas lavándole la cara a Aznar y que cambien de rumbo significaría que algo ha pasado o que está habiendo algún cambio de poderes de influencia.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#57](c57#c-57) La noticia habla de un atentado islamista. ¿ Tu de que crees que hablo ? P.S. No tengo nada contra las cabras.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",
