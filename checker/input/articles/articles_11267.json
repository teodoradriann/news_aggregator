    "title": "Seabourn Pursuit Unveils Century-Old Mystery with Discovery of Lost Shipwreck in Chile",
    "text": "Seabourn, renowned for its ultra-luxury voyages and expedition travel, has made a groundbreaking discovery during a submarine dive near Alejandro Selkirk Island in Chile’s Juan Fernández Archipelago. On October 14, 2024, the Seabourn Pursuit, the brand’s latest purpose-built expedition vessel, uncovered the long-lost Titania, a German supply ship that had been missing for 110 years. Resting 95 meters beneath the ocean’s surface, this astonishing find marks the first sighting of the Titania since it was deliberately sunk in 1914.\n“Experiences like these are a testament to the spirit of expedition, and this discovery is nothing short of historic,” said Robin West, vice president and general manager of expeditions at Seabourn. “Seabourn’s expeditions and particularly our submarine explorations often take our guests to places where no other human has ever explored. I am so incredibly proud of our expedition team for delivering this once-in-a-lifetime and truly unforgettable ‘Seabourn Moment’ to our guests and the local community on Selkirk Island.”\nThe discovery of the Titania was made possible by the submarine team’s dedicated research and close collaboration with local communities, creating a truly one-of-a-kind experience for guests. Led by Submarine Pilot Mauricio Fernandez, the team—comprised of Kieran Buckley, Henrik Enckell, and Isaac Yebra—partnered with local fisherman Gino Perez, who had long heard tales about the Titania’s possible location. Perez joined the dive, assisting the team in pinpointing the suspected wreck site. Under ideal weather conditions, the team uncovered the Titania 95 meters below the surface, roughly 4.25 nautical miles off Selkirk’s northwest coast. Following the discovery, the island’s harbor master confirmed that no previous diver or submarine had ever explored the wreck.\nFernandez shared how the emotion in the submarine was palpable. “We were there witnessing history, and our guests had the chance to be a part of this discovery of Titania and the first to see this ship after she sank to the bottom of the ocean 110 years ago. This was truly a special moment of discovery and a perfect example of how Seabourn expeditions continue to provide our guests with incredible Seabourn Moments throughout each journey.”\nGuests described the feeling when they saw Titania for the first time: “It was almost magical. It really was quite extraordinary,” said Irene Blum, a guest who was in the submarine during the discovery.\nIt was particularly emotional for Perez, who shared, “I imagined this ship so many times and now I can see where she is, how she looks like and how she is resting at the bottom. Thank you so much, my father manages this sector of the island, this means a lot to us and our family history. This is extraordinary.”\nThe Titania was deliberately scuttled on November 19, 1914, and stories of the wreck have been passed down through generations. Although fishermen occasionally found metal fragments in their lobster traps, believed to be from the vessel, the wreck’s exact location had remained undiscovered until now.\nUnveiling the South Pacific: Seabourn Pursuit’s Extraordinary Itineraries\nDuring one of Seabourn Pursuit’s remarkable South Pacific voyages, a historic discovery was made, further enhancing the allure of these adventurous journeys. Spanning over 4,000 miles, these itineraries take guests on an exploration of the rich and remote regions of Melanesia, French Polynesia, and San Antonio, Chile. Along the way, passengers have the unique opportunity to explore some of the world’s most isolated treasures, such as the Juan Fernandez Archipelago off Chile’s coast, spend time on the enigmatic Easter Island, visit the volcanic Pitcairn Islands, and venture into the remote Yasawa Islands of Fiji.\nBuilding on the success of these thrilling adventures, Seabourn Pursuit is set to offer similar deployments in 2025, featuring four exclusive voyages. These include two 20-day journeys, one departing from San Antonio, Chile to Papeete, Tahiti on March 18, 2025, and another from Papeete to San Antonio on October 10, 2025. Additionally, an 18-day voyage from Papeete to Sydney is scheduled to depart on April 7, 2025, and a 16-day Remote Shores of New Guinea & Indonesia voyage will set sail from Sydney to Darwin on April 24, 2025.\nUnforgettable Submarine Adventures with Seabourn\nA highlight of Seabourn Pursuit’s expeditions is the opportunity to embark on unforgettable submarine experiences. Both Seabourn Pursuit and its sister ship, Seabourn Venture, are equipped with two custom-built, state-of-the-art submarines designed to offer guests an extraordinary perspective beneath the ocean’s surface. These submarines allow for a once-in-a-lifetime exploration of surreal underwater landscapes, from the icy depths of Antarctic waters to the vibrant, marine life-filled reefs in tropical seas.\nIn select destinations, guests can dive into unexplored locations, possibly being among the first humans to set eyes on these hidden realms. Seated in two clear acrylic spheres, flanking the pilot’s station, passengers enjoy an awe-inspiring view with virtually undistorted sightlines in every direction. Each sphere contains three passenger seats mounted on a rotating platform, allowing for the best possible viewing experience.\nSubmarine dives are offered on select itineraries, including Seabourn Pursuit’s South Pacific sailings from March through October 2025, and are available for an additional charge. Operated by highly trained pilots, Seabourn’s submarines are built to the highest safety standards, certified by Lloyd’s Register and undergoing annual external inspections. These advanced submarines are designed with multiple safety features, including a safety buoy and a maximum diving depth of 300 meters (less than 1,000 feet). Throughout each dive, a surface boat remains in constant communication with the submarine, ensuring a safe and seamless experience.\nA New Level of Adventure Awaits\nWith its upcoming 2025 voyages and unparalleled submarine explorations, Seabourn Pursuit offers guests the ultimate opportunity to experience the wonders of the South Pacific like never before. Whether discovering historic shipwrecks or witnessing the vibrant marine life in untouched underwater worlds, Seabourn continues to set the standard for ultra-luxury adventure travel, providing guests with experiences they will treasure for a lifetime.",

    "title": "Soup's on! Warm your body and soul with these brilliant bowls from Las Vegas",
    "text": "When we’re feeling under the weather, down or otherwise out of sorts, we turn to soup to help bring us back up. The ultimate comfort comes in the form of a steaming hot bowl. And lucky for us, Las Vegas offers a variety of restaurants proffering hearty, restorative options. Here are a few of our favorites.\nShang Beef Noodle Soup at Shang Artisan Noodle\nShang’s beef noodle soup hits like an internal hug. Hours of braising have turned the chunks of brisket into exquisitely tender bites, falling apart in a deep red, rich and meaty broth. The hand-pulled or knife-cut noodles are your ticket to absorbing all that flavor, and don’t skip the bok choy that floats above the tangle of noodles, inviting you to break up the richness with its crisp texture. It’s a full-bodied bowl of comfort that’ll put you right again. $19, multiple locations, shangartisannoodle.com. –Gabriela Rodriguez\nCarne en su Jugo at La Vecindad\nWhen it comes to flavor, this Guadalajara favorite dethrones most traditional stews. Simmering its meats in tomatillo sauce, serrano peppers and spring onion for tangy, salsa-like consistency, carne en su jugo shocks the palate in the tastiest way possible. Pinto beans and crispy bacon build upon an already wonderful marriage of textures to the point where this hearty meal becomes something you savor rather than slurp. $19, 953 E. Sahara Ave. #E-27, lavecindadlv.com. –Amber Sampson\nTom Kha Kai at Weera Thai\nChicken soup is universally recognized as a remedy for whatever you’re going through, but this version at one of the Valley’s top Thai restaurants offers a knockout punch of flavor to match its possibly medicinal properties. Tons of lemongrass and ginger lay the groundwork; fresh veggies like tomatoes, onions and mushroom boost each beautiful bite; dashes of fish sauce multiply the savory factor; and coconut milk makes the rest of your day a silky smooth ride. Even if you’re dining at Weera alone, we recommend ordering the large hot pot of this stuff; you’ll want more when you get home. $14-$21, multiple locations, weerathai.com. –Brock Radke\nTomato Bisque at Herbs & Rye\nYou come to Herbs and Rye for the cocktails, you stay for the tomato bisque. This velvety, creamy and downright dreamy appetizer—paired with a buttery grilled cheese—has comfort written all over it. Drizzled in a savory basil oil, this soup secures points for its rich aromatics and smooth consistency. But it’s the grilled cheese dunking—that salty clash of toasted bread and tangy tomato—that makes this an undisputed cold weather duo worth relishing. $15, 3713 W. Sahara Ave., herbsandrye.com. –Amber Sampson\nRB Signature Ramen at Ramen Boys\nUnderscoring Ramen Boys’ most popular dish is its savory fusion of chicken and pork broth. That union delivers a well-balanced ratio of creamy thickness to a bowl which could otherwise be overpowered by richness or understated by too light of a texture. It’s instantly warming and almost toe-curlingly good. Tender cuts of chashu pork, supple and savory, also soak up all that umami flavor, winding together with springy noodles, soy-cured egg and the pleasant crunch of green onion. $18, 3650 S. Decatur Blvd. #3, bumbybox.com. –Amber Sampson\nClick HERE to subscribe for free to the Weekly Fix, the digital edition of Las Vegas Weekly!

Le transfert de Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (23 ans) au Paris Saint-Germain est désormais imminent.

Alors que l’officialisation de son arrivée devrait intervenir dans les heures à venir, Kvaratskhelia a pris les devants en annonçant son départ de Naples sur ses réseaux sociaux. « Merci Naples » , a-t-il écrit en légende d’une vidéo postée sur Instagram.\nLe transfert, estimé à 70 millions d’euros, marque un record pour le PSG lors d’un mercato hivernal. Kvaratskhelia s’engagera pour un contrat de quatre ans et demi et touchera un salaire conséquent. Il héritera également du numéro 7, porté précédemment par Kylian Mbappé, et aura pour mission de combler le vide laissé par le départ de ce dernier au Real Madrid.\n🚨 OFFICIEL !

The URL has been copied to your clipboard Share on Facebook Share on Twitter No media source currently available\n0:00 0:05:29 0:00 Direct link 128 kbps | MP3 64 kbps | MP3 Pop-out player A recent report by environmental researchers says that protecting 1.2 percent of the Earth’s land surface could prevent most extinctions.\nExtinction is the permanent disappearance of an animal or plant from the Earth.\nThe researchers estimated that such an expansion of nature preserves would cost about $263 billion.\nIn 2022, United Nations delegates to the COP15 meeting in Montreal, Canada, promised to protect 30 percent of the Earth’s surface by 2030. The U.N. calls the promise the “30-by-30 target.” It aims to protect plants and animals severely affected by climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction.\nIn October, U.N. delegates will gather for a COP16 biodiversity meeting in Colombia to discuss plans for reaching the 30-by-30 goal.\nFILE - This photo of the endangered kagu was taken at the Preservation and Research Center in Yokohama, Japan, Oct. 25, 2010. (REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao) The recent study was published in Frontiers in Science. In it, the researchers aimed to identify the highest value areas around the world. Carlos Peres said he hopes the areas identified will be included in protection plans. Peres was a co-writer of the study and is a conservation ecology expert at the University of East Anglia in Britain.\nPerese said, \"Most countries do not actually have a strategy .”\nHe said, \"The 30-by-30 targets still lack a lot of details because it doesn't actually say what 30 percent should be protected.\"\nThe study's proposed protections would cover an additional 1.6 million square kilometers. This is an area about one fifth the size of the United States. The study includes 16,825 sites that are home to rare and threatened wildlife.\nFILE - These endangered Mexican gray wolves rest at the Museo del Desierto in Saltillo, Mexico, July 1, 2020. (REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo) It is estimated that nearly 16 percent of the world’s surface already has some level of protection.\nThe study estimated that the cost of purchasing land by governments would be about $263 billion. Many of these areas include private property and would be bought at current market values over the next five years.\n\"Time is not on our side,” Peres said, “because it will become increasingly more expensive and more difficult to set aside additional protected areas.”\nMost of the cost of creating protected areas is in buying the land. The study did not consider the costs for policing and maintaining the nature preserves.\nFILE - The waldrapp, a critically endangered species, sits inside the breeding aviary cage at the Preservation and Research Center in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, October 25, 2010. (REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao/File Photo) About three-quarters of the sites are tropical forests. The Philippines, Brazil, and Indonesia are home to more than half of the high-valued areas.\nRussia is the one country with the most high-valued areas. The study said about 138,000 square kilometers should be the target of conservation.\nSeveral African countries are also at the top of the list. Madagascar has the fourth-highest number of areas. And the Democratic Republic of Congo has the largest area targeted for conservation in Africa.\nThe United States is among the top 30 countries in the study. The study said about 0.6 percent of the U.S. should be targeted for conservation. That is an area about the size of the state of Delaware.\nThe researchers only considered land and freshwater areas. They did not consider oceans or marine protected areas. The study also did not include kinds of animals such as invertebrates, or animals without a backbone, like insects.\nThe U.S.-based nonprofit group One Earth paid for the study.\nI’m Anna Matteo.\nJake Spring reported this story for Reuters.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Chatham County, Georgia from 1901-2000 was 51.0. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Chatham County, Georgia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Chatham County, Georgia history.",
