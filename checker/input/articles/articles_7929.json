    "title": "Can Florida see northern lights on Friday? Here's how to see them",
    "text": "Chances are pretty good that if you spent anytime online today you saw people posting photos of the northern lights in places they normally aren’t seen. If you feel like you missed out, you’re not alone, but you may still be in luck. There’s a small chance that you’ll be able to catch another glimpse of the aurora borealis, also known as the https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2024/10/10/northern-lights-in-florida-theres-a-chance-tonight/75615036007/, again tonight, but it probably won’t be as simple as just looking up at the sky for Floridians . Just like the last time Florida was able to see the https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/where-to-see-northern-lights-thursday-solar-storm/75604973007/, back on May 10, the light’s pink and green hues are basically invisible to the naked eye. To really get a good look at it, you’ll need to break out your phone’s camera and let it do the work for you – preferably through the magic of long-exposure photography. Here’s how you might be able to see the northern lights in Florida tonight . Will you be able to see the northern lights tonight in Florida? A geomagnetic storm, which is what causes the northern lights, is forecast to happen again Friday night, but it’s a bit weaker than Thursday’s. That means there is a chance to catch the lights once it gets dark. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a (G3) geomagnetic storm watch for Friday night thanks to something called a coronal mass ejection (CME). That’s a fancy way of saying that there was a massive expulsion of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun’s corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere. The too-long, didn’t-read version of the story is that CMEs can create geomagnetic storms. This particular level is relatively strong, which is why the northern lights are appearing in odd spots of the globe. NOAA says that watches of this level are infrequent but not uncommon. What time will you be able to see the northern lights tonight? “Unfortunately, predicting the timing of auroras is much harder than predicting the weather,” the National Weather Service Tallahassee office wrote on Twitter, which didn’t stop NOAA from attempting to do so anyway. The CME effects began at approximately 11:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, and they are expected to continue through Friday. The best time to look for the northern lights is when its darkest, which is typically around midnight. In Florida, astronomical twilight will occur around 8:18 p.m. EDT and midnight will be around 12:12 a.m. What’s the best way to see the northern lights? Seeing the northern lights takes a bit of effort and a bit of luck. Time and your location are probably the biggest factors in whether or not you’ll see the northern lights, and the reason is the same for both: light pollution. You’ll want to go out and look for the northern lights when its darkest and you’ll want to be in a location away from a lot of light pollution. Looking for the lights with just your eyes is also likely going to be a lost cause in Florida because the auroras will be faint. Instead, grab your camera and snap some photos. Your camera is much more sensitive to light than your eyes are, so it has a better chance of capturing those auroras. If you’re not having any luck with your phone, try adjusting your camera to a lower shutter speed, if possible. You’ll want to grab a tripod or something sturdy you can set your phone on to keep it stable. The longer your camera’s aperture is open, the more light it’s able to capture. Why can’t I see the northern lights? The easy answer is that science is complicated. While it’s true that CMEs can create geomagnetic storms, the truth is that there are several more factors that come into play, such as the Kp index. Thursday’s storm had a Kp index of 8, which meant that the auroras moved even further toward the equator and were very bright and active. Your location also plays a huge factor into whether you’ll see the northern lights. You’ll want to make sure you’re in a spot that doesn’t have a lot of light pollution that could interfere with the lights. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that you’ll see the northern lights even if you do everything right. Northern lights can arrive in pulses, which means they may be visible for periods ranging from an hour to just 15 minutes, reappearing sporadically throughout the night. Lastly, it’s entirely possible that Friday’s storm won’t be strong enough to reach your exact location. The further south you are, the more difficult it will be to spot the northern lights.

    "text": "La congregación detiene los planes para destruir la histórica iglesia de Nueva York después de que celebridades se opusieran Según los informes, los planes para demoler la histórica Iglesia Presbiteriana de West Park en Manhattan, Nueva York, debido a sus dificultades financieras, se han detenido tras las objeciones de residentes locales y celebridades, incluidos Matt Damon y Mark Ruffalo. La iglesia de 133 años tenía la intención de vender la propiedad para convertirla en apartamentos de lujo. Sin embargo, el estatus de monumento del edificio, otorgado en 2010, requirió la aprobación de la Comisión de Preservación de Monumentos Históricos de la ciudad para su demolición, [según](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/nyregion/west-park-presbyterian-church-celebrities-demolition.html) The New York Times, que dijo que la solicitud de permiso de la iglesia, realizada en 2022, generó un apoyo generalizado para la preservación del edificio, incluido de los actores Damon y Ruffalo. La congregación retiró su solicitud, influenciada por una demanda contra un inquilino por una disputa de arrendamiento, días antes de que la comisión votara sobre la solicitud de la iglesia el martes, dijo el Times. Sin embargo, la iglesia planea volver a presentar la solicitud en el futuro. La congregación dijo en un comunicado que resuelven “volver a presentar nuestra solicitud a la LPC cuando se resuelva el litigio para que finalmente podamos invertir en el espacio comunitario y de culto moderno y accesible que el Upper West Side merece y apoyar aún más nuestra misión en nuestro vecindario y en toda la ciudad de Nueva York”, [citado](https://www.westsiderag.com/2024/01/05/west-park-presbyterian-church-withdraws-hardship-application-its-over) por West Side Rag. Los líderes de la iglesia firmaron un contrato vinculante en 2022 con el desarrollador del condominio debido a una factura de reparación de $2 millones que no podían pagar. También presentaron una [solicitud por dificultades económicas](https://www.centeratwestpark.org/save-west-park) buscando quitarle el lugar emblemático y demoler el edificio para dar paso al condominio, que también incluiría espacio de culto para la iglesia. Gale Brewer, miembro del concejo municipal que representa al Upper West Side, expresó su esperanza de que el retraso pueda conducir a la preservación del edificio. En medio de la crisis inmobiliaria de la ciudad de Nueva York, algunos argumentan que la oposición a la demolición de la iglesia obstaculiza el desarrollo de viviendas muy necesarias. “Como anciano de la iglesia y miembro fundador del Centro en West Park, también estoy frustrado por la difícil posición en la que nos encontramos hoy”, dijo Marsha Flowers, anciana gobernante de la Iglesia Presbiteriana de West Park y miembro fundador de la junta. del Centro en West Park, dijo en un comunicado a [The Christian Post](https://www.christianpost.com/news/actor-matt-damon-joins-fight-to-save-historic-nyc-church.html) en ese momento. “Ayudamos a crear el Centro en 2017 para celebrar las artes mientras recaudamos fondos para las reparaciones del edificio, pero los fondos nunca llegaron a pesar de más de una década de promesas y compromisos de los líderes locales”, agregó Flowers. \"Nuestra congregación ahora se centra en crear un nuevo espacio para el culto y las artes, y esperamos utilizar nuestras ganancias para ayudar a otras iglesias a cumplir su misión y evitar circunstancias como la nuestra\". En un esfuerzo por apoyar la preservación del edificio, el actor Matt Damon [participó](https://www.christianpost.com/news/actor-matt-damon-joins-fight-to-save-historic-nyc-church.html) en una obra de teatro en la iglesia en noviembre pasado. Wendell Pierce; La comediante Amy Schumer, así como el rapero y actor Common también han aportado su poder estelar al esfuerzo para salvar el edificio.",
