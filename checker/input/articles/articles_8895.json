    "text": "A yellow weather warning for rain and snow has been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. The warning is in place from 8am until 3pm on Saturday and up to 25mm of rain is expected in lower levels of Scotland, according to the Met Office. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain on Saturday, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. This week, Storm Gerrit caused travel disruption across the UK. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Travellers faced disruption across the rail network with operators urging passengers to check their journeys before setting off. Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: “Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. “Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Jarag village residents seek probe into contamination of groundwater\nResidents of Jarag village, known for the famous cultural and religious Jarag Da Mela, have demanded a probe into the alleged contamination of groundwater, making it unfit for human consumption.\nA deep pond, once dug on the pretext of executing a project, was cited as a major reason for the situation wherein water pumped out by submersibles at many places in the village was declared unfit by the authorities in the health department.\nWhile successive governments have been accused of showing indifference towards demands being raised by the residents regarding basic amenities, some whistleblowers, including NRIs and social activists, have threatened to launch an agitation if action is not taken against those responsible for the alleged degradation of environment and deterioration of water quality.\nSarpanch Sarabjit Singh Mander acknowledged that the pond was dug over four years back during the tenure of the previous civic body. “Though water pumped out with submersibles at various places has been declared unfit for human consumption, we have called upon residents to consume water being supplied through connections installed by the civic body,” said Mander.\nVillagers led by a social activist Gurdeep Singh Kali and NRI Jassie Mander alleged that successive governments had failed to provide basic amenities in the village and check contamination of groundwater.\n“Though health officials led by inspector Shingara Singh Mullanpur had initiated a process for verifying the purity of groundwater, no action has since been taken after all the five samples sent for testing were found to be unfit for human consumption,” said Kali maintaining that higher authorities including CM Bhagwant Mann had been urged to initiate a probe and take action against those found responsible for unauthorised digging of a pond in the village.\nA perusal of records revealed that all the five samples of water sent to State Public Health Laboratory in Kharar through the office of Civil Surgeon, Ludhiana, were found to be unfit for drinking. Besides showing extremely high TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), these samples exhibited a higher percentage of Coliform bacteria, signifying potential contamination from sources like sewage, animal waste or poorly maintained water systems.\nSub-Divisional Magistrate, Payal, Pardeep Bains had earlier advised the BDPOs concerned to inquire into allegations levelled by the residents but no action has been taken to stop further contamination of\ngroundwater in the village and surrounding localities.\nThe healthcare personnel led by SMO, Mannupur, Dr Ravi Datt and Inspector Shingara Singh organised a check-up and diagnostic test camp at Jarag on Wednesday. Blood samples of 140 persons were collected to rule out the possibility of infection by any pathogen. However, reports of collected samples were yet to be received.",

    "title": "SS United States, historic ocean liner built in Newport News, to become world’s largest artificial reef",
    "text": "By Eric Conklin, nj.com, and Virginia Media staff\nOfficials in Okaloosa County, Florida, are moving ahead with plans to sink the SS United States, a historic ocean liner docked in South Philadelphia , turning it into the world’s largest artificial reef.\nKnown as “America’s Flagship,” the SS United States was built at Newport News Shipbuilding and delivered in 1952. With lots of aluminum in its structure, the vessel was only half the tonnage of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier of today.\nBut it had powerful steam-driven turbines that produced 242,000 horsepower — and high speeds.\nOn its maiden voyage in 1952, the SS United States broke the Queen Mary’s trans-Atlantic speed record, set 14 years before. It crossed the North Atlantic in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes, besting the RMS Queen Mary’s time by 10 hours. A catamaran ferry broke that record in 1990, though the United States still holds the record for an ocean liner.\nThe ocean liner was retired from service in 1969 and ended up in Philadelphia in the mid-1990s. It has been the subject of many hopes for revival over the past several decades.\nFile. 1955. SS. United States, passing the skyscrapers of New York City. (The Chicago/Tribune) In what its many boosters term a tragic event, the ship was stripped of many of its onboard parts in a government auction in 1984. Many of the ship’s artifacts were sold on eBay. Some glass panels are on display at museums, including some at The Mariners’ Museum in Newport News . Its silverware and flatware were featured at a restaurant in North Carolina.\nA propeller from the SS United States serves as an entranceway marker to The Mariner’s Museum, passed by thousands of vehicles a day on Warwick Boulevard.\nOkaloosa County Commissioners on Tuesday approved a contingent contract to purchase the ship, scuttle it in the Gulf of Mexico and establish a land-based museum to preserve the ship’s legacy, according to a news release.\nA vote on the contract was tabled last month because of a lawsuit filed by Penn Warehousing, where the ship is currently docked, and the SS United States Conservancy .\nOkaloosa County officials estimate $9 million will be needed to turn the ship into a reef, including $1 million to purchase the ocean liner.\nThe ocean liner is still docked alongside the Delaware River in Philadelphia despite having missed a court-imposed deadline to leave Pier 82.\nA federal magistrate judge agreed to suspend the Sept. 12 deadline after the ship’s owner, the SS United States Conservancy, and the dock’s operator, Penn Warehousing, ended up in court over the vessel’s release from the pier, it was previously reported.\nThe Conservancy filed a court motion to extend its deadline to Dec. 5, arguing Penn Warehousing prevented the group from meeting the deadline by requiring it to pay $3 million before it would release the ship from the port. An attorney for Penn Warehousing has not returned requests by NJ Advance Media for comment.\nIf the SS United States is sunk, it would, at 990 feet long, become the world’s largest artificial reef, surpassing the USS Oriskany, a former naval ship previously sunk in the Gulf.\nAbout 10,000 divers yearly explore the sunken Oriskany, resulting in over $3 million in annual economic impact, according to a news release.\n“I am extremely proud of our team and the effort required to achieve this tremendous next step in bringing such a breathtaking vessel to the waters of Destin-Fort Walton Beach,” Okaloosa County Board Chairman Paul Mixon said in a statement.\nOkaloosa County created a five-year plan to increase diving tourism off its beaches. Officials first eyed the SS United States for purchase first in 2022.\n“Our artificial reef system has shown impressive growth through the years and this accomplishment confirms our commitment to remain good stewards of the environment, while also enhancing our community’s status as a premier diving and fishing destination,” Mixon said.\nThe ship, meanwhile, would remain afloat for potentially while it’s prepared for the ocean floor. A process to make the vessel environmentally sound could take over a year, and arranging the scuttling could take up to a year, officials said.\nIt was unclear Wednesday when the SS United States could be towed from the Delaware River.\nThe Conservancy hoped to explore several fates for the famed ship, such as converting it to a museum, but the court-ordered eviction left the organization with few choices.\n“We are confident that the experienced and committed team in Okaloosa County fully appreciates the historic significance of the SS United States and our longstanding commitment to educating and exciting future generations about this unique expression of American maritime history and technological innovation,” Susan Gibbs, the Conservancy’s president, said in a statement. Her grandfather designed the vessel.\nEscambia County, Okaloosa’s western neighbor, last month initiated a fundraising effort to purchase the ship, appearing to re-show initial interest in scuttling the vessel for diving purposes.\nDaily Press and Virginian-Pilot reporter Peter Dujardin contributed to this report.\nEric Conklin may be reached at econklin@njadvancemedia.com.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.
