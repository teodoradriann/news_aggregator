    "title": "The Mission review: Devotion leads an American missionary to his death in the Andamans",
    "text": "The Mission review: Devotion leads an American missionary to his death in the Andamans\nOne of the most gut-wrenching scenes in all of modern cinema comes at the end of Werner Herzog’s 2005 documentary, Grizzly Man. The film tells the tragic story of Timothy Treadwell, an outdoorsy American man who made the mistake — as so many of Herzog’s protagonists do — of staring into the abyss without bothering to consider the consequences. Treadwell was killed by a grizzly bear that he’d deluded himself into thinking he could tame. They recovered audio of the fatal attack, which Herzog listens to on camera in the film, but crucially, restricts from the audience. It distressed him to the point that he instructed Treadwell’s ex-girlfriend to destroy it immediately.\nDirectors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss perhaps came across a similar ethical dilemma in their new film, The Mission, which in many ways can be seen as a thematic companion piece to Grizzly Man. Like Herzog’s classic, the documentary follows the exploits of another adventurer — the Evangelical missionary John Allen Chau — who got more than what he bargained for after making illegal contact with the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands. The Sentinelese are perhaps the world’s most isolated community, having fended away almost all attempts at communication by the outside world.\nChau, a mixed-race American who grew up in the ‘90s, slowly became obsessed with the idea of converting the Sentinelese to Christianity. He believed that the island was Satan’s last great stronghold, and that only he could bring the Gospel of Christ to the 200-odd people who are said to live there. Chau wasn’t always a religious zealot, however. He grew up on The Adventures of Tintin and Robinson Crusoe, but found himself drifting away from conventional pop-culture in his teens, as he became completely entrenched in the Evangelical movement.\nChau’s life story is recounted in gorgeously animated sequences by his own father, who openly blames the Evangelicals for what happened to him. Chau was aware that the Indian government had forbidden all contact with the Sentinelese. He also knew that several past expeditions had ended with the Sentinelese giving clear warning signs to incoming explorers by aiming arrows at them. One of the most enduring images of the tribe — this also gives the film’s producers, National Geographic, a chance to offer internal critique about the west’s messiah complex — forever painting them as the savages in the eyes of the ‘civilised’ world.\nThe movie makes an honest attempt at capturing the complex blend of obsession, devotion, and delusion that sent John Allen Chau on his suicide mission. Perhaps the most interesting interviewee — the movie also features one of Chau’s old friends, and his many enablers from the Evangelical community — is the linguist Daniel Everett, who sees in Chau a kindred spirit, and harbours a vague sense of guilt over what happened to him. Everett spent decades with the Pirahã people of the Amazon, initially with the intention of teaching them the Lord’s ways. But in an unexpected turn of events, he found his own faith crumbling when the Pirahã started resisting his lessons.\nHe’s a fascinating character, someone who tears up at the mere memory of an old aphorism — “He gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.” — and freely admits that his three-decade mission might have been a waste of time. Whatever statements that The Mission is unable to make in literal terms, it makes by awarding Everett a large chunk of the screen time. But he isn’t a martyr, not like Chau.\nWe see endless self-shot footage of Chau climbing mountains, jumping into rivers, scurrying along narrow forest paths — visuals that could ostensibly project him as a ‘regular’ person. But Everett offers perhaps the film’s most sobering observation, when he warns that Chau’s reckless actions might inspire others to make similar illegal incursions into forbidden territory. It’s a dangerous proposition, and as one person keenly notes, none of this takes into consideration what the Sentinelese might want.\nThe Mission\nDirectors – Amanda McBaine, Jesse Moss\nRating – 4/5\nFor the latest news from across India, Political updates, Explainers, Sports News, Opinion, Entertainment Updates and more Top News, visit Indian Express.

    "title": "Union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers reaches deal, ends unlimited strike - North Shore News",
    "text": "MONTREAL — A union representing 40 per cent of Quebec teachers has reached a deal in principle with the government and is ending a strike that has shut around 800 schools since Nov. 23. Fédération autonome de l’enseignement — or FAE — said Thursday night on social media that it spent the day analyzing a tentative deal with the province and will recommend it to its members for approval during general assemblies after the holidays. Details of the agreement have not been released. Even though the FAE called the deal \"a new step,\" it emphasized \"it is up to the teachers to respond to (Premier) François Legault's government and to say whether they feel they have been heard.\" The union said it has ended all of its pressure tactics, such as the general strike that has shut 800 schools, including in Montreal, since the end of November. If students affected by the FAE strike return to school as scheduled in January, they will have been away from classes for almost seven consecutive weeks. The FAE, which represents more than 66,000 teachers, took the most hard line out of all the public sector unions negotiating new contracts with the government when it launched an unlimited general strike. Earlier today, the government announced it had reached tentative deals on salaries with an alliance of unions, excluding the FAE, representing 420,000 public sector employees, including teachers and health-care workers. They had walked out sporadically since November, for a total of 11 days. The only major labour group without any sort of agreement is a nurses union with about 80,000 members — Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec — which said today that negotiations are ongoing. Earlier Thursday, before the FAE announced the end to its strike, Sylvain Martel, spokesman for parents group Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, said he was feeling optimistic but remaining cautious that 800 schools would reopen after the holiday break. \"We're glad that we're able to hope for going back to school on Jan. 9, but everything is tentative, lots of people have to agree to what's on the table, so let's hope that it's a real deal and (union) members will get what they want,\" he said in an interview. Martel said discussions have been taking place between teachers, parents and administrators about how children will catch up after missing so much school. How that happens will vary, he said, because the effects of the strikes were unequal — some parents taught their children at home, others hired tutors, but many less-fortunate students spent weeks with little to no learning at all. \"It's very difficult for students to go back to the same rhythm they were in November, so it's going to take a little while, but we'll get there,\" he said.

    "text": "As December’s gentle winds swept across Lānaʻi, I found myself celebrating my 31st birthday in a way that felt both unexpected and perfectly right. After a whirlwind year, I wasn’t just seeking another luxury retreat – I was searching for a meaningful way to close out 2024 and welcome in 2025. What made this journey extraordinary wasn’t just the destination, but my companion: my mother, embarking on our first-ever mother-daughter getaway.\nSensei Lānaʻi Plays the Perfect Host for a Renewing Mother-Daughter Retreat\nDominique JacksonJan 23, 2025\nOn this remote Hawaiian island where traffic lights don’t exist and the population barely reaches 3,000, time seems to move differently. As a travel writer who has chased countless sunsets and deadlines, I’ve grown accustomed to needing a vacation from my vacations. But this time was different. Departing the island, I felt a profound sense of renewal that extended far beyond the typical post-resort glow – a testament to both the property’s innovative approach to wellness and the precious time spent connecting with my mother. I can confidently say that Sensei Lānaʻi, A Four Seasons Resort, co-founded by tech visionary Larry Ellison and Dr. David Agus, a world-leading physician and scientist, offers something truly extraordinary.\nWe hope you love Sensei Lānaʻi, A Four Seasons Resort! Just so you know, Matador may collect a small commission from the links on this page if you decide to book a stay. Listed prices are accurate as of the time of publication.\nThe journey begins: planning for, and arriving to, Sensei Lānaʻi\nMy mother and I touched down in Honolulu, our excitement building as we made our way to a sleek private terminal. Here, a Lana’i Air flight awaited – not just a transfer, but our first taste of the thoughtful luxury that would define our week ahead. The short flight offered breathtaking views of the Hawaiian archipelago, but it was the pre-arrival experience that truly set the tone for our stay. Weeks before landing, I had engaged in a detailed consultation with my assigned Sensei Guide. Through my pre-arrival questionnaire, my Sensei Guide learned about wellness goals and was able to prepare a custom itinerary for my journey upon our first meeting.\nA sanctuary in the uplands\nNestled in Kō’ele, the spiritual uplands of Lānaʻi, the resort spreads across an ethereal landscape where Cook pine forests meet swaying palms. The 96 accommodations are masterfully integrated into the natural surroundings. Each room is a study in minimalist luxury – pristine white interiors that seem to breathe with the island’s rhythm, offering a blank canvas for a mental reset.\nThe property itself is a work of art, featuring a sculpture garden that wouldn’t be out of place in a world-class museum. But it’s the water features that truly captivate: an onsen garden with 10 heated soaking tubs, a serene gazing pond, and a lap pool that seems to merge with the horizon. The 1,000-square-foot private spa hales (Hawaiian for“home”) deserve special mention – these individual wellness sanctuaries offer treatments that go beyond typical resort massages, incorporating advanced therapeutic techniques and evidence-based practices. I watched my mother’s face light up as she explored every corner.\nDining at Sensei: wellness combines with culinary mastery\nDuring our week-long stay, the glass-enclosed Sensei by Nobu became our culinary sanctuary – each meal a testament to the extraordinary fusion of wellness and gastronomy. As the property’s sole restaurant, I initially wondered if dining at one venue might become monotonous. Instead, I found myself eagerly anticipating each meal, curious about what innovative dishes would appear next. The genius lies in a collaboration between legendary Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and physician Dr. David Agus. Together, they’ve crafted a menu that transcends typical wellness cuisine, proving that nutritious food can be both mindful and magnificent. I found myself drawn to their Shabu Shabu, which was a choice of lean beef, chicken breast or tofu, mushroom broth, and spicy calamansi ponzu. On my birthday evening I indulged in the Omakase experience.\nA place of shared discoveries\nWhat sets Sensei Lānaʻi apart is its scientific approach to wellbeing. The schedule offers 12 daily rotating classes featuring small-group activities such as hiking, yoga, fitness, meditation, art, and nutrition. It’s the personalization that makes the difference. Your Sensei Guide isn’t just a wellness coordinator; they’re a partner in your journey, adjusting your program based on real-time feedback and goals. From clifftop golf courses to mountain biking trails, archery ranges to ziplines, the activities program makes full use of Lānaʻi’s 90,000 acres of diverse terrain.\nBut perhaps the most valuable activity is simply being present in this remarkable setting, where the boundaries between luxury resort and natural sanctuary blur. The resort’s diverse activity program became our playground. One morning, we found ourselves learning the ancient art of Hawaiian lei-making, our fingers working with fragrant flowers. Next, in an archery session that had us both initially skeptical, we discovered hidden talents and shared high-fives when arrows found their marks. Between wellness activities, we couldn’t resist exploring the island’s coastal charms. A short drive took us to the resort’s sister property for a beach day that felt like stepping into a postcard.\nA new definition of luxury wellness\nAs the last day approached, my Sensei Guide sat with me in a secluded garden spot for what she called our “pathway forward” session. Unlike typical resort goodbyes that feel like abrupt endings, this felt more like planning the next chapter. At Sensei Lānaʻi it wasn’t just about the time we spent on the island; it was about creating lasting change that would extend far beyond our departure.\nAs we prepared to leave, soaking in one last sunset from the garden, I reflected on how this birthday celebration had become something far more significant. In a world that often moves too fast, Sensei Lānaʻi had given us the precious gift of time together. The resort’s thoughtful integration of luxury, wellness, and natural beauty created the perfect backdrop for strengthening the most important bonds in our lives.\nI’ve learned through years of travel writing that the most memorable journeys aren’t about the thread count of the sheets or the fame of the chef – though Sensei Lānaʻi excels in both. They’re about the moments that change us, the conversations that deepen our connections, and the experiences that remind us of what truly matters. Sensei Lānaʻi is a place where the journey to wellbeing is as rewarding as the destination itself, and where the simple act of being present becomes the greatest luxury of all.",

    "text": "The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to extreme weather. Between late October and mid November 2024, the country was hit by a barrage of storms, starting with severe Tropical Storm Trami on 22 October, and ending with Tropical Storm Man-Yi which made landfall on 16 November.\n“Typhoon” is the term used to describe a tropical cyclone – a tropical storm with wind speeds of at least 33 metres per second – that forms in the northwest Pacific . (If a tropical cyclone forms in the Atlantic Ocean or north-eastern Pacific Ocean, it is called a hurricane.)\nEven for a disaster-prone country, such rapid “clustering” of typhoons was “unprecedented”, one Filipino expert told a press briefing.\nBy the end of November 200,000 individuals were displaced across six regions – many of whom had been forced from their homes multiple times in just one month.\nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) service finds that climate change has exacerbated the conditions that enabled these powerful storms to form in the Philippine Sea, such as warm seas and high humidity.\nOf the six major storms that hit the Philippines between the end of October and middle of November this year, three made landfall as “major typhoons” with wind speeds above 50 metres per second (112 miles per hour). This is 25 per cent more likely to happen in today’s climate than it would have been in a pre-industrial world without human-caused warming, the study finds.\nThe typhoons “highlight the challenges of adapting to back-to-back extreme weather events”, the study says. The authors add that “repeated storms have created a constant state of insecurity, worsening the region’s vulnerability and exposure”.\n‘Unprecedented’ typhoon season On 22 October 2024, severe Tropical Storm Trami made landfall on the Filipino island of Luzon – the country’s largest and populous island . The storm rapidly dumped one month’s worth of rain over parts of the island, with floods sweeping the country.\nHowever, the residents were given little time to recover. Just days after Storm Trami subsided, the Philippines was hit by Super Typhoon Kong-Rey . More than nine million people were affected by the two storms and almost 300,000 displaced.\nAs the weeks progressed, the Philippines was hit by Typhoon Yinxing , Typhoon Toraji and Typhoon Usagi . Finally, Tropical Storm Man-Yi made landfall on 16 November, marking the end of the record-breaking month.\nAfrhill Rances works at the Asia-Pacific regional office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , and is an author on the WWA study. She told a press briefing that, even for a disaster-prone country, the rapid “clustering” of typhoons in 2024 was “unprecedented”.\nDr Claire Barnes – a research associate at Imperial College London ’s Grantham Institute and an author on the study – added that in the Philippines, “in November we would expect to see only three named storms in the entire basin at any point, with only one of those reaching super typhoon status”. A super typhoon is defined as any typhoon with winds above 58 metres per second (130 miles per hour).\nThe back-to-back storms formed so rapidly that November saw four named storms forming in the Pacific basin simultaneously. Japan’s meteorological agency said this was the first time in seven years – and the first November in recorded history – where four named storms have formed in the Pacific at the same time.\nTyphoon intensity Typhoons are complex events, which can be intensified by climate change in many different ways , including their rainfall intensity, storm surge height and wind speed.\nThe authors of this study focus on a metric called “potential intensity”, which looks at temperature , humidity levels and sea level pressure over the Philippine Sea where the typhoons formed.\nBen Clarke , a study author from the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London , told the press briefing that potential intensity indicates the “theoretical maximum intensity for a tropical cyclone”. He explains that the metric is “based on the conditions in the atmosphere and the ocean which are crucial for cyclone development”.\nThe map below shows the average potential intensity of the Philippine Sea between September and November 2024, where red indicates high potential intensity and blue indicates low potential intensity.\nThe dotted lines show the tracks of different storms. The black square indicates the study area. Potential intensity is calculated as the potential wind speed of the typhoon in metres per second.\nAverage potential intensity in the Philippine Sea over September-November 2024, using ERA5 data. Source: WWA ( 2024 ).\nTo put this year’s record-breaking typhoon season into its historical context, the authors analysed a time series of average potential intensity in the Philippine Sea, using an observational reanalysis dataset stretching back to the year 1940.\nThe study says:\n“Our best estimate is that the observed potential intensity has become about 7 times more likely and the maximum intensity of a potential typhoon has increased by about 4 metres per second.”\nThe authors also carried out attribution analysis to assess whether the increase in potential intensity can be linked to human-caused climate change.\nAttribution is a fast-growing field of climate science that aims to identify the “fingerprint” of climate change on extreme-weather events, such as heatwaves and droughts. To conduct attribution studies , scientists use models to compare the world as it is today to a “counterfactual” world without human-caused climate change.\nThe authors find that the potential intensity in the Philippine Sea in 2024 was 1.7 times higher than it would have been in a world without climate change. They add that the maximum potential intensity of a typhoon has increased by about 2 metres per second due to climate change.\n(These findings are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. However, the methods used in the analysis have been published in previous attribution studies .)\nLandfall Climate change is exacerbating the conditions needed for tropical cyclones to form. However, tropical cyclones are still fairly infrequent and there is a “short period of reliable observations” of tropical cyclones that make landfall, according to the study.\nThis can make it challenging for scientists to assess the impact of climate change on the frequency of tropical cyclones using traditional methods.\nTo address this problem, researchers from Imperial College London developed a “synthetic tropical cyclone dataset” called IRIS earlier this year. This dataset uses observations from 42 years of observed tropical cyclones to create a “10,000-year synthetic dataset of wind speed”.\nThe database includes millions of synthetic tropical cyclone tracks . Each track maps the wind speed of the tropical cyclone from its formation to its landfall, to describe how its power changes throughout its lifetime.\nThe team has already used this method to attribute the extreme winds of Typhoon Geami and Hurricane Beryl , which hit China and Jamaica, respectively, earlier this year.\nOf the six major storms that affected the Philippines in the month-long period, three made landfall as “major typhoons”, according to the WWA. The authors define a major typhoon as a category three or above, indicating sustained wind speeds above 50 metres per second.\nUsing the IRIS dataset, the authors assessed how likely it is for three typhoons to make landfall in the Philippines in a single year under different warming levels. They find that in today’s climate – which has already warmed by 1.3°C as a result of climate change – the Philippines could expect three major typhoons to make landfall in a single month roughly once every 15 years. This is 25 per cent more frequent than in a world without climate change.\nThey add that if the planet warms to 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, “we expect at least three major typhoons hitting in a single year every 12 years”.\n‘Supermarket of disasters’ The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to extreme weather events and natural disasters, and is already facing deadly impacts from climate change.\nThe country’s location in the Pacific ocean makes it highly vulnerable to typhoons, volcanoes and earthquakes. The WWA study adds that the country “is experiencing sea level rise more than three times faster than the global average”. And the Philippines is facing deadly heatwaves , which have been made more intense as a result of climate change.\nRances told the press briefing:\n“In the Red Cross we call the Philippines a ‘supermarket of disasters’, because you name it – we have it.”\nThe Philippines is struck by more typhoons every year than almost any other country in the world. It has “gradually shifted its approach from reactive to proactive risk management with a significant focus on preparedness and resilience building”, according to the World Bank.\nFor example, warning and pre-emptive evacuation orders were sent out ahead of many of the typhoons this year. Schools, ports and airports were closed in many regions. And disaster response teams were mobilised.\nHowever, the unrelenting barrage of typhoons this year overwhelmed many of the country’s disaster preparedness systems, exhausting supplies and overstretching emergency responders. It also left communities with little time between storms to recover and prepare.\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that, at the end of November 2024, more than 200,000 individuals were displaced across six regions, hundreds of fatalities and injuries had been reported and more than 250,000 homes had been damaged. The damage to livestock, agriculture and infrastructure was estimated to be around US$47m at the end of November.\nThe Filipino government spent more than US$17m on food and other aid for the hundreds of thousands of storm victims. It has also sought help from neighbouring countries, the US and the United Nations.\nThe consecutive typhoons “highlight the challenges of adapting to back-to-back extreme weather events”, the study says. It adds:\n“With 13 million people impacted and some areas hit at least three times, repeated storms have created a constant state of insecurity, worsening the region’s vulnerability and exposure.”\nThe authors warn that “major investment is needed to help the Philippines adapt to extreme weather”.\nThis story was published with permission from Carbon Brief .\nLike this content?
