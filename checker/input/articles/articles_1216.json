Enlace copiado Leer todo el artículo Justicia para Ren y Maya: Colectivas se manifiestan por el caso de dos mujeres arrolladas por el Metrobús\nPersonas han pedido justicia para Renata y Maya , quienes fueron arrolladas por una unidad del Metrobús en la Ciudad de México en abril; como parte de esta exigencia, colectivas se manifestaron el miércoles bloqueando el cruce de Eje 1 Poniente Guerrero y Eje 2 Norte Manuel González, en la alcaldía Cuauhtémoc. Alrededor de 20 mujeres encapuchadas realizaron pintas y rompieron algunos vidrios de la estación Tlatelolco y dañaron una unidad que circulaba en ese momento. El 10 de abril las mujeres fueron atropelladas en ese mismo cruce , por lo que en las protestas del miércoles las manifestantes usaron mantas y fotografías para impedir el paso a cualquier tipo de vehículos hacia Paseo de la Reforma.\nContinuar leyendo",

    "text": "PUNTA GORDA, Fla. - As Hurricane Ian slammed into Southwest Florida last year, Syd Kitson took some amazing video from his back porch of white caps rolling across the lake behind his house. Ian was a Category 4 storm at the time and had sustained winds of 100 mph. \"I remember sitting in my house, thinking ‘this is the biggest test we could ever imagine,’\" Kitson recalled. RELATED: Hurricane Ian recovery continues one year later It was a test for Babcock Ranch, a massive, planned community just 20 miles inland from the devastated Fort Myers Beach. Kitson was the developer. \"Resiliency was something we really spent a lot of time on from day one,\" he said. After Hurricane Ian passed, he could see just how much that planning paid off. \"All around us was devastation, loss of life, and it was just awful to see. But here, life was back to normal in one day,\" Kitson said. MORE: Eagles symbol of American strength while Floridians continue to rebuild after Hurricane Ian So, how were they able to do it? It started by choosing land that sits 30 feet above sea level. Then, leaving the existing wetlands wet. \"We found the natural flow-ways where all the water would go, and we stayed out of them. Don’t mess with mother nature because you’re going to lose every single time,\" said Kitson. All Babcock utilities are buried, so water and power service were never disrupted, and Florida Power and Light helped Babcock Ranch create a sustainable power source. \"We were able to work with them to become the first solar-powered town in America,\" said Kitson. There are 700,000 solar panels on 840 acres powering the town of Babcock Ranch. READ: Kiwanis Club of North Port helps community rebuild one year after Hurricane Ian They have a smart storm water system that lowers lakes during heavy rain. And, if those get overwhelmed, Babcock&apos;s streets are designed as spillways, carrying water to wetland areas. Tom and Susan Port moved to Babcock after Hurricane Ian hit their retirement home on Sanibel Island. \"We had storage units under the house and five and a half feet of storm surge took all that out,\" recalled Susan. Their home survived, but hearing how well Babcock Ranch weathered the storm piqued their interest. \"We spent weeks cleaning, and we’re like ‘this place is a disaster. We’re retired. This is not what we bought into to live in,’\" said Susan. Native plants are also key to the community&apos;s success. Babcock requires 75% of landscaping to be native. They&apos;re built to survive Florida&apos;s high winds, intense heat and heavy rains better than invasive species. MORE: Venice Theatre is beacon of strength as community continues rebuilding a year after Hurricane Ian For the safety of future generations of Floridians, Kitson hopes other developers in the state follow Babcock&apos;s playbook. \"Let’s find a way so that our kids and our grandkids have a place to live that’s better than we have today,\" he said. When it&apos;s finished, Babcock Ranch will have more than 19,000 homes. Home prices start in the 300&apos;s and go up to $4 million.",

    "text": "Texas Legislature 2025\nBill to create dementia research institute approved in House, but could face $3 billion funding hurdle\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThe Texas House on Wednesday passed a Senate bill that would create a $3 billion Texas research fund for dementia, but another measure to activate the funding for it could face obstacles in the chamber on Monday.\nSenate Bill 5, by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, creating the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, was approved by House members, 127-21.\n“To me this is a dream come true,” state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, told members before the final vote. Thompson, who has worked on previous efforts for such a research fund for the past eight years, urged her colleagues to pass it because every lawmaker has constituents with relatives whose lives have been impacted by Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, dementia and other brain diseases.\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick signaled his prioritization of such a fund last fall.\nOn Monday, House members are scheduled to vote on Senate Joint Resolution 3, which would require voter approval. If voters approve the constitutional amendment, the initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue would be transferred to the fund and a board appointed by Patrick and Gov. Greg Abbott would be set up to approve research proposals. Going forward, the institute would receive up to $300 million annually. This funding is intended to attract physicians, researchers, and experts in the field of dementia to Texas. This institute would research all brain diseases, not just dementia.\nDespite the overwhelming support for the Senate bill, SJR 3, however, could fall victim to the dispute over school vouchers. House Democrats threatened early last week to kill all constitutional amendments for the rest of session unless the House votes to put school vouchers before voters in November. A constitutional amendment requires approval of at least 100 votes from the House’s 150 members to pass the chamber before going before Texas voters. With 62 Democrats in the House, Republicans need at least 12 Democrats to make any constitutional amendment happen.\nThe House passed the vouchers bill on Thursday with every present Democrat voting against it. Amid the Democrat blockade, Republicans postponed all five constitutional amendments that were up for consideration on Tuesday and on Wednesday, SJR 3 was postponed and another constitutional amendment, HJR 72, failed to reach the needed 100 votes.\nEven so, members across the aisle are also signaling disapproval. Some Republicans have criticized the $3 billion pricetag for running counter their tenet of downsizing government.\nsent weekday mornings.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy and\nTerms of Service apply.\nState Rep. Brian Harrison, R-Midloathian, urged lawmakers to vote the bill down because he said it does nothing more than to expand the state’s bureaucracy. The $3 billion should be returned to taxpayers, who were overcharged on their taxes, he said.\n“Every Texan would love to find a cure for dementia,” Harrison said. “But I do not know what part of stop-growing-government-and-give-people-back-their-money, that this body doesn’t understand.”\nState Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress, who is also an anesthesiologist, countered that while he too is against expanding government, there is a danger if the public relies solely on private enterprise, namely the pharmaceutical industry, to fund all medical research. Too often, he said, the industry oversells the promise of a drug that they’ve developed only to double back later and insist that it wasn’t as effective after all.\n“The only solution to that problem is to provide an independent, non-conflicted source of funding,” Oliverson said. “Medical research should never be like the arts, where essentially the patrons, the ones that fund it, are the ones that decide what art is.”\nAlzheimer’s, a degenerative brain disease, is the most common form of dementia, accounting for about 80% of cases, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, about 12% of the state’s population over the age of 65. While a 2023 study shows that the eastern and southeastern United States have the highest prevalence of Alzheimer’s, Texas is one of three states that has the highest estimated number of older residents who are at risk of Alzheimer’s.\nThe symptoms — memory loss and the inability to perform simple tasks — tend to develop in the mid-to-late 60s and occur when clumps of abnormal proteins block the communication of brain cells. Symptoms can be mild at first and worsen over time.\nOf the nearly 7 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s, nearly two-thirds are women, and dementia care costs Americans more than $300 billion a year. The cost of caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is estimated to be $1 trillion by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.\nTickets are on sale now for the 15th annual Texas Tribune Festival, Texas’ breakout ideas and politics event happening Nov. 13–15 in downtown Austin.
