    "title": "Navy Air Defense Mission in the Red Sea Makes Case for Directed Energy Weapons, Says VCJCS Grady",
    "text": "Downing Iranian-supplied missiles and drones with multi-million dollar SM-2 missiles to protect shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden is a bad exchange that must change, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday.\n“It has been an air-defense fight” in which the Navy and Air Force, along with allies and partners in Operation Prosperity Guardian, have largely prevailed in demonstrating “how we bring defense in depth,” Adm. Christopher Grady said during a U.S. Naval Institute-CSIS Maritime Security Dialogue.\nTo change the cost-benefit equation, he wants more directed energy systems deployed “where a drop of fuel becomes a weapon” to destroy attacking unmanned systems.\nFor the Navy, in particular, he said Red Sea operations have shown how “the ships, carrier and air wing” can “learn quickly and fast” in responding to evolving threats that have included ship hijackings, unmanned surface and subsurface vessels’ attacks, in addition to missile and unmanned aerial vehicle strikes.\nBut “the solution [in the Red Sea] is not a military solution,” he said, referring to the larger conflict between Israel and Hamas that began in October. The fighting in Gaza shows no signs of ending soon. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, when they began attacking merchant shipping heading to and from the Suez Canal, said their strikes would be limited to vessels delivering goods to Israel.\nAs months passed, the attacks became indiscriminate, including on U.S. Navy ships participating in Operation Prosperity Guardian, an international effort by more than 20 nations like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, to protect merchant shipping in the region.\n“I would like to see more from concerned stakeholders,” Grady added.\nAs part of Prosperity Guardian, the U.S. and U.K. have carried out airstrikes on suspected missile launch sites and assembly facilities in Yemen that have produced mixed results. Since the first attacks in the fall, an estimated 70 percent of the maritime traffic that routinely passed through those waterways have changed course to sail around Africa rather than risk a transit near Yemen.\nThe Houthis have now extended their missile attacks into the\nIndian Ocean, according to press reports.\n“I don’t know if [the Houthi missile and unmanned systems’ attacks] deter” merchantmen from sailing in those waters, but they have forces commercial shipping companies to consider what routes to take, Grady said.\nWhen asked to evaluate how air defense worked on April 13, when Iran\nretaliated against Israel for targeting Iran’s Syrian embassy, Grady said that like the Aegis destroyers, Israel, allies and partners “did their jobs.”\nIran fired more than 200 drones and cruise missiles, but only a few made it through Israeli defenses.\n“Years of training together” paid off in knowing “who’s going to shoot what, when. You don’t do that overnight,” he added.\nAs for the impact of Iran firing “one-way drones” on Israeli targets, he said they were “not very successful.”\nGrady said Ukraine’s need for air defense is an area “that concerns me most.” The $60 billion aid package passed after a six-month delay in Congress is coming at a time when Russia has adopted a “we’re coming after critical infrastructure and the electric grid” strategy to alter the course of the war in its third year.\nThe package also addresses immediate needs, like artillery and 155 mm shells, long-range munitions, electronic warfare systems and unmanned capabilities.\nGrady said both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries “are learning organizations” and understand the value of “never underestimating your enemy” to adapt. The war has seen forces “weaponizing” iPhones and employing unmanned systems in the air and on the water.\nWhile both sides still use the Soviet tactic of “shoot and then move,” relying heavily on artillery to clear the way for an infantry assault, unmanned aerial vehicles have stymied Russia’s massed armor attacks from the beginning, he said.\nThe increased use of electronic warfare to jam GPS targeting has also changed throughout the war. “Early on, we didn’t see EW,” but now “it’s certainly one of the battlefield characteristics” in Ukraine, Grady said.\nWith 18 months left to serve in his position, Grady said he wants to strengthen the joint requirements process. Grady said he and his two immediate predecessors have taken steps to reduce the stovepiped process of committing to individual service-specific systems and shift to a portfolio approach in the Pentagon and on the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which includes all of the service vice chiefs.\nThe combatant commanders’ need for hardware and software quickly versus the services looking at the future creates “a constructive tension” over requirements, he said. Grady wants to “put teeth in the JROC,” where the services would follow through on its decisions.\n“Traceability” through a “scorecard” would allow the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to see if and how a gap is closed. During his remaining time in office, he doesn’t expect to see a change in the Goldwater-Nichols law that restructured the services’ and Pentagon’s role.",

    "text": "World Amid Israel's urgent evacuation notice to residents of eastern Rafah, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has sent word of the group's acceptance of a ceasefire proposal to Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Amid Israel's urgent evacuation notice to residents of eastern Rafah, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has sent word of the group's acceptance of a ceasefire proposal to Qatari and Egyptian mediators, Al Jazeera reported on Monday. Thousands of people flee eastern Rafah after Israel orders people to evacuate as fears of a full-blown military assault on the city sheltering more than one million displaced people grow. The details of the ceasefire deal have not been disclosed. This comes as Israel's military issued an urgent evacuation notice to residents of eastern Rafah, following a warning from the country's defence minister of impending \"intense action\" in the area, CNN reported. Avichay Adraee, head of the Arab media division of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, urged residents to \"evacuate immediately\" to designated humanitarian areas at the checkpoints for their safety. The call specifically targets individuals residing in the municipality of Al-Shawka and the neighbourhoods of Al-Salam, Al-Jneina, Tiba Zaraa, and Al-Bayouk in the Rafah area. The announcement comes amidst the ongoing bombardment of Gaza, with significant devastation witnessed since October 7. Many residents of Rafah, already displaced multiple times, now face the prospect of further displacement amid escalating conflict, as reported by CNN. The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas, where about 2,500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip, leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages. Israel, has since, characterised its Gaza offensive as targeting Hamas' infrastructure with the goal of eliminating the entire terror group while making efforts to minimize civilian casualties.

    "title": "What Nikki Haley’s gaffe reveals about the GOP",
    "text": "What Nikki Haley’s gaffe reveals about the GOP\nThe new Nikki Haley news is that she refused to say that slavery was the cause of the Civil War. During an event in New Hampshire, she said that the bloodiest conflict on US soil was about, well,\nanything but slavery: “how government was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do,” she said, among other ridiculous things.\nMagdi Jacobs, an Editorial Board contributor,\nsaid that “the fascinating thing about Haley's response was her discomfort. You could feel her flailing as she reached for the perfect combo of a pre-Donald Trump conservative ‘states’ rights’ answer to appeal to centrist voters, all while knowing that the insurrectionists want more racist red meat.”\n“This is a balance no one can strike,” Magdi concluded. “It shows how fundamentally weak the current GOP is, even if our political media doesn't want to admit it. You can't win without Trump. I firmly believe – and I think Haley does, too – that you can't win with him either.”\nMore precisely (and I think Magdi would agree) is that this balance is impossible to strike because there’s nowhere to put it. There’s no such thing as a moderate position inside today’s Republican Party. There’s no foundation on which to build the broad coalition of voters that’s necessary to winning (ie, candidates need more than a base.) If such a position existed, Haley would have found it. It doesn’t, so all she can do is reach for a reason, any reason, as the true cause of the Civil War.\nTo her credit, Haley\nquickly walked back her remarks. Perhaps she sensed something was at risk in sounding so unreasonable. “Of course, the Civil War was about slavery,” she said. “We know that. That’s the easy part of it.” Then she went on to say that it was about “more than that,” citing, among other ridiculous things, “the role of government.”\nThat she walked back her initial remarks may seem “reasonable,” but it won’t matter. Remember, even if she wanted to strike a balance between “conservative states’ rights” and “racist red meat” – and that’s apparently what she wanted to do – there is no foundation inside the Republican Party on which to put it. There is no moderate position.\nTo be a moderate, you have to sound reasonable, but according to David Atkins, a frequent contributor to the Washington Monthly, the GOP base “doesn’t want even the perception of a more reasonable candidate. They want a dictator to punish their enemies.”\n“Haley has zero chance of winning” the presidential election, David told me. “Even if she did win New Hampshire, it wouldn’t help her any more than it did Bernie Sanders in 2016 and Pete Buttigieg in 2020.”\nThere’s always makebelieve, though. Fortunately, Haley has a lot of help in that regard. The billionaire Koch brothers gave her their blessing. So did the popular governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu. They portray Haley as the champion of “conservative values,” as if “conservative values” was still shorthand for “moderate,” and as if Donald Trump’s gravity has not pulled the entire party to the far right.\nWhile makebelieve is a powerful force in politics, it’s probably not going to be enough for Haley or any of the other GOP candidates. Oh, sure, they did OK while the neutral press was casting them as “legitimate alternatives” to Trump. But once the neutral press gets bored – and the neutral press always gets bored – whatever promise these “legitimate alternatives” once had melts into the air. It happened to Ron DeSantis. It happened to Vivek Ramaswamy. It will probably happen to Haley. Everything begins and ends with Trump. As Magdi said, the GOP can’t win with him and it can’t win without him.\nIn the following interview with me, David Atkins explains not only why he thinks Haley is doomed, but why, in 2024, the Republicans are, too.\nJS: New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu endorsed Republican candidate Nikki Haley after the Koch network did. Could that be enough for her to win New Hampshire? And will that matter in the long run?\nDA: GOP megadonors need to come to terms with the reality that their base cannot be controlled. They let the MAGA flames burn out of control and now they get to reap the whirlwind. Haley has zero chance of winning absent some issue impacting Trump’s health, because the GOP base doesn’t want even the perception of a more reasonable candidate. They want a dictator to punish their enemies.\nAnd let’s be clear: Haley is also a radical rightwing extremist, as her embrace of a six-week abortion ban makes clear. She just doesn’t seem like she wants to destroy the entire federal bureaucracy, send Democrats to gulags, weaponize the Justice Department and the IRS against all their domestic opponents, and institute mass deportation camps of immigrants. So she’s not the candidate of the GOP base, which does want those things and wants Trump to deliver them.\nThe Republican Party’s base isn’t in the thrall of Trumpism; Trump is the avatar of their desires, which is why he will be the nominee. Also, even if Haley did win New Hampshire, it wouldn’t help her any more than it did Bernie Sanders in 2016 and Pete Buttigieg in 2020.\nJS: You said the\nculture war is over. Taylor Swift won, Elon Musk lost. I have written that obituary, too, only to see myself proven wrong.\nDA: The culture war is over in the sense that people under the age of 50 in the areas of the country that make up more than 80 percent of the national GDP despise the theocratic conservatism that animates Republican activists. That isn’t going to change.\nThis doesn’t mean that Republicans can’t win elections, and institute rearguard policy actions, like restricting abortion and LGBT rights. They can. The threat of hard-right fascist dictatorship is very real.\nBut most of the culture wars can be explained by the fact that the marketplace responds primarily to 18- to 45-year-old consumers in cities, while the electoral system responds primarily to 65-plus-year-olds in exurbia. The electoral system can produce a fascist takeover, but it will do so by oppressing a majority that wants nothing to do with it. Such tyrannies rarely last for long.\nIn the meantime, the weight of popular culture is increasingly shifting to treat cultural progressivism as normative, if for no other reason than that’s the population advertisers want to appeal to. The engines of capitalism are working against social conservatives now, which is why you see such a growing rift between the evangelical base and the urbanite business Republican crowd.\nJS: You said the\nGOP will lose 2024. You cited the fact that they have lost every special election. Special elections attract partisans. Presidential election attracts everyone. Am I wrong in noting the difference?\nDA: It’s no secret that Trump and Biden at the top of the ticket will make for an interesting dynamic in 2024, since neither are popular, at least at the moment. But in this environment, a generic Democrat is consistently beating a generic Republican. If the public’s concerns about both Trump and Biden as individuals were sidelined, and the voters were to choose a party and its policies, Democrats would be marching into a confident victory in 2024.\nThe key will be to remind voters of the tremendous legislative accomplishments of the Biden administration, emphasize Trump’s rampant criminality and danger to democracy, and remind people that no matter what they think of the candidates, the policy choices are very real. Republican rule would be a cruel disaster.\nJS: I think the GOP is\ngoing to impeach Biden. How does that factor into your thinking, if it does, that the Republicans are going to lose 2024?\nDA: Republicans want to play tit-for-tat by impeaching Biden to take some of the sting out of Trump’s double impeachments. More generally, if they can make impeachment into a routine partisan clown show, then it minimizes and defangs the one tool in the Constitution that’s designed to stop an authoritarian, criminal unitary executive.\nThe flip side of doing this is that any impeachment of Biden by Republicans on flimsy pretexts is likely to have as minimal an impact on voters as Trump’s impeachments apparently have.\nJS: What if there's a major polling error and Trump isn't really a mile ahead of every other Republican candidate? Most of us just assume he's going to be the nominee. Iowa and New Hampshire might be stunners?\nDA: What’s particularly interesting about Trump seizing the GOP nomination is the low-key panic among many Republican activists. While Trump’s indictments have so far not impacted his popularity, we are in uncharted territory. It’s impossible to predict what impact multiple public trials and possible felony convictions of the sitting GOP nominee might have on public polling and electoral outcomes.\nOne could speculate that the polling might be wrong, and GOP voters in Iowa and New Hampshire might choose a different nominee out of self-preservation. But Trump has developed a cult-like following, and one thing that we know about cults is that they are largely impervious to even their leaders going to jail. If anything, it makes them feel like martyrs. So I find it extremely unlikely that Iowa and New Hampshire will surprise us by selecting a Haley or Ron DeSantis.\nDavid Edwards - Alternet.org › Meaghan Ellis - Alternet.org › Why the 'ageist' claim that Trump 'has the stamina for the presidency' and Biden doesn’t falls flat ›",

    "text": "Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\nThe number of antisemitic hate crimes across Britain increased dramatically in the weeks after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, new figures revealed today.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nGreater Manchester Police saw the number of anti-Jewish hate crimes rise five times, while the British Transport Police saw offences spike more than tenfold.\nThe Community Security Trust (CST) described the figures as ‘shocking’ and said they made clear ‘the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7’.\nThe Home Office also condemned the rise in offences, adding: ‘There is no place for hate in our society.’\nAnti-Semitic calling Jews ‘evil’ was recently sprayed on skate ramps used by children in a park in Notting Hill, west London\nThe figures have been obtained using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\nGreater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). A spokesman for the CST said: ‘This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n‘It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.’\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that ‘levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging’.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a ‘significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7’, adding: ‘The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n‘We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.’\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nFull responses were obtained from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nTens of thousands of people gathered in central London for a rally against antisemitism in November\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\nSome forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings ‘provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7’.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had ’caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress’.\nA spokesman added: ‘We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.’\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: ‘Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n‘The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.’\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: ‘There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n‘We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n‘Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.’",

We thank staff... and recognise the frustration of residents for which we apologise.\"\nADVERTISEMENT There is a discrepancy between the council and the union over how many staff the restructuring would affect, but the number lies between 70 and 76.\n\"It is regrettable that it has come to [potential redundancies], the council has consistently tried to find a solution to the industrial action,\" the authority said in a statement.\n\"We have made a very fair offer which means that no worker need lose any money. That offer remains open.\"\nHowever, the union said the authority was \"refusing to discuss the issue that we are are in dispute over\".\n\"They have still given no explanation around why there is a so-called equal pay issue, and that's fundamental to this,\" said Onay Kasab, Unite's national lead officer.\nThe strike began earlier this month [BBC] \"Potentially, we are talking about 72 people, but we will make sure that the council does not go ahead with that process,\" he told the BBC.\nADVERTISEMENT \"They have said that nobody will lose any money out of this, and we know now... that people are going to be losing money, not only that, but we know what their attitude is.\"\nMr Kasab added that if staff are made redundant it would mean the dispute would be extended.\nRats on streets In its statement, the city council said all staff had been offered alternative employment at the same pay, and almost three-quarters of staff had taken the offer or taken voluntary redundancy.\n\"There are now 41 workers who have declined any offer, and 35 workers who opted for valuable and skilled driver training, who have also told us via a letter from Unite that they are working under protest,\" it said.\nThe negotiations are due to begin again on Monday.\nThe industrial action has now been going on for the best part of three months, and images of rubbish piling up on the streets of Birmingham have been seen around the world.\nADVERTISEMENT Residents have complained about bad smells, and there have been reports of rats in the streets, as piles of bin bags continue to grow.\nCouncillor Majid Mahmood said the council was willing to work \"around the clock\" to bring the strikes to an end [BBC] Councillor Majid Mahmood, who this week resigned from Unite after the union failed to condemn reported violence on picket lines , said the bin collection service was in need of modernisation.\n\"I share the frustration of residents. I understand they're fed up,\" he said. \"I'm a born and bred Brummie.\n\"I have not had a collection for a fortnight myself, but we have put contingencies in place to try to support residents during this industrial action.\n\"We've extended the hours of the household recycling centres so they can book a slot online and attend the centre to dispose of waste.\"\n\"My message is to Unite - please work with us. We're willing to work around the clock to resolve this.\"\nADVERTISEMENT Follow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds , Facebook , X and Instagram .\nMore on this story Related internet links",

    "title": "La volea de Griezmann devolvió la fe al Atlético",
    "text": "A los cinco minutos, el Atlético de Madrid se puso por detrás en el marcador ante el RB Leipzig. El peor inicio posible habían tenido los colchoneros en la Champions League cuando Sesko cabeceó al red el rechace de Oblak tras un disparo de Openda. A partir de ese momento comenzó un partido en el que los colchoneros se volcaron en la portería de Gulacsi para lograr igualar el marcador. Julián pudo hacerlo de tacón tras un saque de esquina desde la izquierda; Riquelme en un mano a mano que prefirió cedersela a Correa, el propio Correa en varias ocasiones aunque la más clara fue la que pegó primero en un palo y después en el otro para que la acabase recogiendo el meta Gulacsi. Parecía que los colchoneros tenían los plomos fundidos de cara a puerta mientras iban pasando los minutos. Hasta que en el minuto 28 la enésima buena internada de Marcos Llorente por la derecha terminó con un centro al centro del área para que Griezmann se sacase una preciosa volea con la que batió al meta húngaro del RB Leipzig. Era el 1-1 y la explosión de alegría en el Metropolitano. Es el tercer tanto del francés esta temporada en la que ya marcó contra el Girona de falta en la segunda jornada y hace unos días cuando le marcó al Valencia tras un cabezazo de Samu Lino. Tras este gol Griezmann se sigue perpetuando como el máximo goleador en la historia del Atlético de Madrid. 184 goles lleva en este momento, seis más que Luis Aragonés. Una diferencia que es mayor en competiciones europeas dónde acumula 39 goles por 28 del Sabio. Todo ello en un partido en el que le tocó retrasar su posición. La presencia de Correa y Julián en el once provocó que el francés jugase en el centro del campo, al principio pegado en la banda izquierda pero según fueron pasando los minutos fue centrando más su posición. Lo cierto es que el francés cada día está más cerca de su mejor versión.",
