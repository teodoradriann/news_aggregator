[Find out how to contact us during the holiday period](https://www.tga.gov.au/about-tga/contact-us/tga-operations-over-holiday-period-2024-25).\nBoston Scientific have advised that a subset of ACCOLADE™ dual chamber (DR) standard life (SL) and DR extended life (EL) pacemakers; and VISIONIST™ cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps) have an increased risk of permanently entering Safety Mode which has limited functionality.\nAffected Model numbers: L311, L331, U225, U226, U228\nProduct Names:\n- ACCOLADE DR SL MRI\n- ACCOLADE DR EL MRI\n- VISIONIST CRT-P EL\n- VISIONIST CRT-P EL MRI\nWhat is the problem?\nAffected devices are at risk of permanently entering Safety Mode during telemetry or other normal, higher-power operations. This has been associated with the pacemaker failing to adequately regulate the heart’s rhythm and rate in some patients.\nWhat are the risks?\nRisks associated with this problem occurring include:\n- Device replacement/surgery being required\n- Loss or pause of pacing activity that may result in death or serious injury in some patients not sufficiently treated by Safety Mode\n- Muscle stimulation\n- Heart failure.\nWhat should patients do?\n- Continue to have your device monitored, either remotely or through your existing in-office follow-up schedule.\n- If monitoring indicates your device has entered Safety Mode, immediately contact your treating clinician for a review and to discuss management options.\n- Also consult with your treating clinician if you:\n- have new or worsening symptoms such as light-headedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness or loss of consciousness\n- have any questions about your device potentially entering Safety Mode or\n- to determine the remaining battery life and whether or not the problem may affect you.\n- Should you be experiencing symptoms and unable to contact your clinician we recommend attending your nearest healthcare facility for assessment.\nWhat should health professionals do?\n- Monitor patients with affected pacemakers through remote or in-person visits.\n- When a device is in Safety Mode, you will be directed to contact Boston Scientific via the LATITUDE programmer warning screen and a LATITUDE remote patient management system red alert.\n- Monitor patients for symptoms indicating device performance problems, such as light-headedness or loss of consciousness.\n- General prophylactic device replacement is not recommended: unless a patient has a device in the advisory population and are at risk of harm due to non-programmable parameters in Safety Mode.\n- If monitoring indicates that the device has entered Safety Mode, arrange for the device to be replaced. Timely replacement is recommended to avoid risks associated with time spent in Safety Mode.\n- Detailed information can be found in the customer letter supplied to clinicians who have implanted this device.\nThe problem with these devices will be corrected by a software update. Boston Scientific will communicate when the update is available to detect the onset of a high impedance battery state.\nReporting problems\nConsumers and health professionals are encouraged to [report problems with medical devices](https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/reporting-problems).

    "text": "Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird is reminding Iowans of some tips after nearly 400 incidents of social media account hacks and takeovers were reported in 2024. “Many Iowans spend years building networks and profiles on social media,” Bird said in a news release. “When a scammer takes over, masquerading as these Iowans or sabotaging their hard work, it is easy to feel helpless.” Account takeovers happen when scammers break into a user’s account often by changing passwords or stealing login credentials, according to the news release. Iowa businesses are “particularly” vulnerable to scammers as they rely on social media to promote their products, the news release said. “The good news is we can take action to stop it,” Bird said. “My team is committed to helping Iowans recover their accounts and preventing future takeovers.” Bird shared that a hacker locked an Iowan out of her personal and professional account for the Iowa Hall of Fame and Racing Museum, which was the main way she promoted events for fundraising and sharing announcements. The woman was kept out of her account for nearly a year even though she sought help from Facebook’s customer service. It was only when the woman reached out to the Iowa Attorney General’s Office that she was able to regain control of her accounts, the news release said. In March, Bird called on Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, to address the rise of account takeovers on its social media platforms. The Iowa attorney general’s guide to protecting your social media accounts Use strong and unique passwords: Bird suggests avoiding using any information that can be easily gathered such as birthdays, pet names or common phrases. Two-factor authentication: Using two different forms of identification to access an account adds a layer of protection beyond a single traditional password, Bird said. Be cautious of suspicious links and attachments: Bird warns social media users not to click on links or download attachments from unknown sources that could potentially contain malware. Be mindful of what you share online: Bird suggests avoiding sharing personal information such as a date of birth, home address or financial information on social media. Monitor your account activity: Bird suggests checking your social media account regularly for any unusual activity, such as unauthorized posts or messages. What to do if your social media account is hacked in Iowa Any Iowan experiencing an account takeover or lockout should contact the Iowa Attorney General’s Office at 888-777-4590 or file a report online.

    "text": "Alexandre Padilha (PT ) , o ministro da Secretaria de Relações Institucionais, disse nesta quinta-feira (26) que o governo Lula “fará tudo o que for necessário” para garantir a manutenção do arcabouço fiscal.\n“O que o presidente [Lula] sempre diz é que ele fará tudo que for necessário para combinar responsabilidade social e fiscal. A medida disso é exatamente o cumprimento do marco fiscal, estamos terminando este ano cumprindo à risca o marco fiscal”, disse Padilha em entrevista à “CNN”.\nO ministro comentou sobre o tema ao ser questionado sobre a preparação de novas medidas de contenção de gastos pela equipe econômica.\nPadilha comentou sobre as oscilações que vive o câmbio brasileiro, com a cotação do dólar chegando a R$ 6,20 ou mais, mesmo com as intervenções do BC (Banco Central), como a venda de US$ 3 bilhões nesta quinta. O ministro disse que o governo espera que a situação cambial se normalize.\n“Sempre temos a expectativa da normalização desse ambiente [do câmbio]. Eu não faço esses cálculos [sobre quanto dólar pode baixar]. O mais importante é retomarmos a serenidade nesse debate [sobre o câmbio], olhar os números econômicos do país”, argumentou o ministro.\nAlém disso, Padilha também comentou sobre o crescimento da inflação, durante entrevista à “TV Fórum”, segundo o “Valor”.\n“O que se tem é a busca implacável e permanente do controle da inflação, puxar para as metas. Temos que enfrentar isso com serenidade porque o fio da economia é muito grande”, ressaltou o petista.\nQuanto às prioridades do governo para 2025, o ministro defendeu que um dos focos deve ser a chamada “reforma da renda”.\n“A expectativa é que esse debate [reforma da renda] aconteça durante todo ano que vem, é um debate justo. É necessário concluir isso ao longo do ano que vem para que, em 2026, todos aqueles que ganham até cinco salários mínimos tenham isenção no Imposto de Renda [IR]. Se essas pessoas não tiverem que pagar IR, isso [dinheiro isento] vai virar mais consumo, girando a economia do país”, afirmou Padilha.\nPadilha diz que governo tem compromisso com marco fiscal O ministro das Relações Institucionais, Alexandre Padilha, afirmou, nesta segunda-feira (23), que o governo tem compromisso de cumprir o marco fiscal , aprovado neste ano. As informações são do “Estadão”.\nSegundo ele, as decisões do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva e do ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad , foram importantes para os resultados fiscais deste ano, mesmo com as pressões do mercado.\nO ministro explicou que o marco fiscal é um contrato entre o governo, a sociedade e os atores econômicos. De acordo com ele, o governo federal vai fazer de tudo para cumprir as metas definidas .\n“Estamos terminando dois anos de governo com o menor déficit primário da última década. É verdade que nem todas as questões sociais foram resolvidas, mas é verdade que a liderança do presidente Lula e do ministro Haddad colocaram caminho para o Brasil perseguir esse desafio de combinar investimento social, investimento público com responsabilidade fiscal”, disse Padilha, em entrevista à “GloboNews”.\nPadilha também enfatizou que todos os sete nomes indicados por Lula para o BC (Banco Central) foram aprovados pelo Congresso. “E nesse segmento não há qualquer questionamento dos atores econômicos sobre a competência desses sete nomes indicados pelo presidente”, destacou.",

    "text": "A storm-driven rogue wave crashed past a seawall in California and struck running beachgoers, pushed cars and turned streets into rivers.\nThe entire terrifying ordeal was captured on\nvideo by a bystander in Ventura on Thursday.\nA man can be seen walking calmly on the sand in the Pierpont neighborhood near Seaward Avenue as a swell in the distance approaches the seawall.\nThe water continues toward the shore and when it doesn’t stop, several people begin to flee.\nColin Hoag, who\n recorded the unusual occurrence, can be heard saying some expletives as he runs while still filming the swell continuing to climb up the street.\nPeople can be heard screaming and a car is seen driving up the street with water surrounding it.\n‘Oh my god,’ Haog says, as he stops several blocks away from the shore. Water is seen spreading more slowly.\nShop owners step outside to observe the streets turned into rivers. Some people wade more than ankle deep in the water.\n‘I was able to capture this entire event on video this morning at the Seaward wall in Pierpont,’ wrote Hoag on\nFacebook on Thursday afternoon.\nAt least eight people were injured, according to Ventura County Fire Department Spokesman Andy Vansciver.\n‘All of the people in the area were swept down on to shore,’ Vansciver told\nKEYT. ‘Multiple vehicles in the area were moved around and swept around due to the impact and force of the water.’\nThere were at least 12 swift water rescues across Ventura County. The fire department urged the public to stay away form beaches.\nThe rogue wave was generated by powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean that have caused coastal flooding and evacuations across the California coast and in Hawaii.\nEvacuation orders were in effect in Marin County on Thursday morning and later in the day in Santa Cruz County.\nWaves were estimated to reach 28 to 40 feet, the National\nWeather Service said.\nConditions were expected to improve in San Francisco on Friday morning, but forecasters said the worst could still be ahead in parts of southern California, with San Diego likely to see highest surf on Saturday.

    "text": "El sindicalista incombustible: el medio siglo de Víctor Fernández luchando por la minería\n\"En todos estos años, lo que más me ha marcado ha sido la solidaridad de las Cuencas\", afirma el aún responsable del sector Minero de FICA-UGT\nSi el carbón se usó durante décadas como combustible y la vida de las minas llegó a 2018 fue en parte culpa de gente incombustible. Como Víctor Fernández, actual responsable del sector minero de FICA-UGT, y que lleva medio siglo vinculado a la lucha sindical por mejorar las condiciones de trabajadores y comarcas. Hablar de \"Vitorón\", como se le conoce, es hablar de historia viva del sindicalismo minero. Y aunque su trayectoria haya sido eclipsada por nombres como el de José Ángel Fernández Villa, en su haber puede decir que ha participado en la elaboración de todos los planes del Carbón firmados hasta la fecha.\nVíctor Fernández nació en Oviedo hace 74 años, pero a los pocos meses ya se trasladó a vivir en Santa Cruz, donde residió durante su infancia y su juventud. \"Todavía vivía ahí cuando entré a trabajar en la mina\", recuerda. Fue con apenas 16 años cuando entró en Mina Dominica, su primer destino. De ahí pasó a la mina Catalana antes de llegar a su destino definitivo, el pozo Santiago, en 1969. Pocos años después, en 1976, \"Vitorón\" se afiliaba a la UGT y al PSOE, y arrancó un periplo que ya dura medio siglo.\n\"A pesar de ser tan joven, me eligieron para formar parte de la 'Comisión de los 16', que fue la que negoció el primer plan de empresa de Hunosa\", rememora Fernández. Un hecho que tuvo lugar en 1977, con apenas 26 años, y que le marcó de manera especial. \"Fue cuando comienzo en la primera línea sindical\", recuerda. Durante los años siguientes, estuvo en la dirección del SOMA, \"a veces compatibilizándolo con el trabajo y otras liberado\".\nVitorón siguió dando batalla sindical desde el SOMA hasta 1990, cuando durante dos años dio el salto a la política, para ser concejal en Mieres en el equipo de Gustavo Losa. Sin embargo, en el 92, se fue Madrid. \"Fue la primera fusión que hubo en el sindicato, la que tomó por nombre FIA-UGT, que en Asturias llevaba delante el SOMA, como ocurre ahora\", recuerda. Esa entrada en la Ejecutiva Nacional del sindicato como responsable minero le haría conocer de primera mano cada detalle de los planes del carbón que han guiado las cuencas las últimas tres décadas y media.\nClaves\nCuando se le pregunta por los momentos claves en esas negociaciones de los planes mineros, Víctor Fernández huye de los entresijos políticos. \"A mí lo que siempre me marcó es la solidaridad que hay en las comarcas mineras, de toda la gente en general, y también de los propios trabajadores del sector\", dice. Lo justifica en que \"siempre que hemos hecho alguna protesta la sociedad de las Cuencas se ha volcado\". Y en el caso de los mineros, dice, \"se han hecho unos sacrificios muy importantes, con huelgas, meses sin cobrar y todo por luchar no solo por su trabajo, sino también por sus territorios\".\nEn su larga trayectoria también le tocó vivir accidentes, tanto dentro de la mina como ya en el plano sindical. \"Yo no sufrí ningún accidente grave, pero si tuve compañeros cerca de mi tajo que perdieron la vida\", recuerda con cierta nostalgia que hace que los ojos le brillen. A la cabeza se le viene un accidente que vivió en el pozo Santiago, en la cerca de la capa La corrida, donde trabajaba. Varios compañeros quedaron atrapados tras un derrabe. \"Fue uno de los impactos más duros y más difíciles de mi vida\", admite. En el plano sindical, el accidente de Nicolasa, el del pozo Emilio o más recientemente el de Cerredo, han sido sucesos que también le han marcado.\nNegociaciones\nEste mierense de Santa Cruz es el único sindicalista que ha estado en las negociaciones de todos los planes del carbón. \"Cada uno ha tenido lo suyo, porque además siempre se partía de la base de que todo iba encaminado a liquidar el sector\", apunta. Desde el primer plan que se firmó, en 1998, han pasado casi tres décadas. \"Los primeros documentos para la restructuración de las Cuencas fueron planes que los sindicatos no firmamos, fueron aprobados por el Gobierno\", recuerda sobre los primeros pasos que ya en 1990 se comenzaban a dar para cerrar minas.\n\"El primer plan que se firma fue el 98-2005, y fue un plan bueno\", rememora. Después llegarían el 2006-2012, y tras este, el que para Fernández fue el acuerdo más complicado. \"El más difícil de todos, por sus características y además porque el PP fue sistemáticamente el que lo fue incumpliendo, fue el de 2013-2018\", apunta el sindicalista. \"Fue el plan más malo, apenas se ejecutó nada, y lo achacaron a una crisis, pero el caso es que las comarcas mineras se vieron muy afectadas\", recuerda.\nY de ahí, al actual marco de actuación, 2019-2027. Otro documento que para Fernández no fue fácil de negociar. \"Estábamos en conversacioness con el PP, y llegó la moción de censura a Rajoy\", explica, para agregar que \"esto fue en junio y en diciembre había que tenerlo todo aprobado\". Así, \"tuvimos que negociar a la carrera, pero finalmente logramos un pacto muy digno\", dice.\nFuturo\nCuando se le pregunta por los fondos mineros, Fernández prefiere ver la parte positiva. \"Se hizo lo que se pudo, y a toro pasado no vamos a saber nadie si se hubiese podido hacer más\", sentencia. Sin embargo, todavía mira hacia adelante: \"llevamos un proceso de 25 años, y no se tiene que acabar en 2027\". De hecho, el sindicalista tiene claro que en la próxima Comisión de Seguimiento del Plan va a poner sobre la mesa que al menos se extienda durante cinco años.\n\"Es necesario que se amplíe en plan del carbón y se amplíen los fondos en 250 millones, porque es de justicia\", dice Fernández. \"Quienes cerramos fuimos nosotros, quienes perdieron el empleo fueron las comarcas mineras, y quienes tiene que cambiar todo el tejido industrial son las Cuencas y las ayudas tienen que venir del Estado\", subraya. \"Eso es muy fácil de entender\", ironiza.\nA sus 74 primaveras, y tras 50 años de militancia activa, Víctor Fernández sigue pensando en carbón. \"No sé si queda Vitorón para rato. De momento vamos a ver si acabamos este año y empezamos el siguiente, y como dice un entrenador (el Cholo Simeone), con esta edad hay que ir partido a partido\", apunta. \"Si el cuerpo resiste y la cabeza sigue algo fresca, voy a seguir ayudando a lo que pueda\".

    "title": "Senior Fianna Fáilers want a pledge to NOT go into coalition with Greens again",
    "text": "A blistering row has broken out in the Coalition on the eve of the elections, with calls from within the parties to rule out entering government together again.\nWith the European and Local election polls on Friday, long-standing tensions over Green policies are emerging once again.\nFianna Fáil TD James O’Connor has called on his party to make a pledge that it will not partner with the Greens again. While Green Party chair Pauline O’Reilly told the Irish Daily Mail that a spate of political attacks on their candidates from Coalition colleagues had ‘eroded trust’ and it is now ‘very difficult’ to see how they could share power again in a future government.\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan, who gave a stark warning to Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday on the devastating impacts of climate change in Ireland, warned that Fine Gael candidates elected to Brussels would try to halt environmental policies.\nFianna Fáil TD James O’Connor has called on his party to make a pledge that it will not partner with the Greens again. He raised concerns that the European People’s Party (EPP) grouping, of which Fine Gael is a member, would align themselves with anti-climate ‘nihilists’ in a bid to hold on to the balance of power in the European Parliament.\nHe said: ‘Will the EPP and Fine Gael, will they go with the right in stopping the Green Deal, which there’s every sign that they might well do?\nThe row follows an attack on the Greens by former Fine Gael minister and MEP candidate for Dublin, Regina Doherty, who told the Irish Mail on Sunday that there is a ‘need to combat the over-mighty Greens in Europe’.\nShe claimed that ‘the Greens currently are doing more harm than good to the climate change agenda’ and accused them of leading an ‘autocratic style of government’.\nThe comments were branded an ‘error of judgement’ on Wednesday, by Senator O’Reilly, a candidate in the Midlands-North-West constituency. She told the Mail: ‘They’re [Fine Gael and Fianna Fail] certainly making it difficult to work with them after the next election if you know that you can’t trust them.’\nGreen Party chair Pauline O’Reilly said that a spate of political attacks on their candidates from Coalition colleagues had ‘eroded trust’. Pic: Leon Farrell/RollingNews.ie She said they were trying to ‘pull the wool over voters’ eyes’ by distancing themselves ‘from decisions they were involved in’. Ms O’Reilly agreed that the prospect of a general election in the coming months is ‘a part of it’ and that the other Government parties are ‘gearing up’ for another election. She added: ‘They’re trying to abdicate all responsibility for decisions they’ve made… it is completely untrue to say people aren’t being brought with us on it and spreading misinformation about what’s happening.’\nMr Ryan also hit out at Ms Doherty on Wednesday, accusing her of seeking ‘political advantage’ by criticising climate change policies. Her rival in the race for the Dublin MEP seat, Green TD Ciarán Cuffe, had earlier accused her of rhetoric ‘going back 30 years, it’s living in the past’.\nMr Cuffe said: ‘People should be aware of the choice they face when they’re voting this Friday: climate chaos with Fine Gael or a liveable, safe future with the Greens.’\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan, who gave a stark warning to Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday on the devastating impacts of climate change in Ireland, warned that Fine Gael candidates elected to Brussels would try to halt environmental policies. Pic: Conor Ó Mearáin/Collins Photos Asked if he agreed with those comments, Mr Ryan said: ‘I think Ciarán is right.’\nFurther stoking the row, Fianna Fáil TD James O’Connor has called for his party to issue a pre-general election ‘firm line’ that they will not re-enter government with the Greens. He told the Mail: ‘In my view, doing businesses with the Greens for the last four years has been extremely difficult to stomach for the Fianna Fáil grassroots supporters.’\nThe row follows an attack on the Greens by former Fine Gael minister and MEP candidate for Dublin, Regina Doherty, who told the Irish Mail on Sunday that there is a ‘need to combat the over-mighty Greens in Europe’. Pic: Fergal Phillips A Fine Gael government spokesman insisted on Wednesday night: ‘There is absolutely no issue in terms of the stability of the coalition.’\nA Green Party government spokesman said: ‘At election time people set out their vision. We are three different parties.’ He said hia party is ‘very confident’ of retaining their two seats in Europe.",

    "text": "By Keith Burbank, Treasure Coast Newspapers ,\n1 days ago PORT ST. LUCIE — About three weeks after Stuart temporarily removed fluoride from its drinking water, Port St. Lucie officials have done the same.\nThe announcement was made Wednesday and affects 95,000 water customers in the city. Fluoridation was stopped Sunday, and it takes about two days to refresh the system, according to the city.\nThe St. Lucie West Services District serves 6,800 customers in Port St. Lucie. Officials there could not be reached for comment.\n“Our top priority is to provide our customers with the safest and highest-quality product possible,” said Kevin Matyjaszek, director of the Port St. Lucie Utility Systems Department, in a statement. “Given recent concerns, we felt it was in our customers’ best interest to temporarily halt adding fluoride to our water until more information is available.”\nBoth Stuart and Port St. Lucie removed fluoride from their drinking water temporarily because of Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo's concerns about the health risks.\nThe state's position The risks include \"adverse effects in children reducing IQ, cognitive impairment and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,\" Ladapo said in a statement last month.\n“The previously considered benefit of community water fluoridation does not outweigh the current known risks, especially for special populations like pregnant women and children,” Ladapo wrote.\nBut he also said, “It is clear more research is necessary to address safety and efficacy concerns regarding community water fluoridation.\"\nA great health achievement Ladapo's statements come following years of widespread certainty that fluoride is good for dental health.\nOfficials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have lauded the use of fluoride in drinking water as one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dental Association have endorsed the idea.\nMore than 70% of Floridians drink water with added fluoride, according to self-reported numbers collected by the Florida Department of Health.\nPort St. Lucie officials' reasoning City officials looked at what Stuart did, but ultimately decided on their own to remove fluoride from the city's drinking water, city spokesperson Scott Samples said.\nCity Manager Jesus Merejo worked with Matyjaszek to make the decision on Friday, Samples said. Merejo could not be reached for comment.\nA 1989 county ordinance requires the city to add fluoride to its drinking water. But, according to the city, County Attorney Daniel McIntyre told Port St. Lucie officials that it's best to avoid enforcing the ordinance considering Ladapo's concerns.\nNext steps It was unclear Wednesday when the city would reconsider the temporary removal of fluoride from the water. The decision will involve the City Council and St. Lucie County officials, Samples said.\nMore: Stuart temporarily removing fluoride from drinking water following surgeon general warning\nMore: Some Treasure Coast governments still considering warning about fluoride in tap water\nCity officials will consider new data if it comes in, and the public will have the chance to weigh in when the issue goes before the City Council. Its next meeting is Jan. 13.\nThe City Council is aware of the issue because Merejo mentioned it to them, Samples said. But no votes were taken.\nKeith Burbank is TCPalm's watchdog reporter covering Martin County.

    "text": "State Senate District 3 candidate Christopher Cabaldon has been endorsed by Democratic Clubs within this district, which includes the United Democrats of Southern Solano County, Northern Solano Democratic Club, Progressive Democrats of Benicia, Rio Vista Democratic Club, West Sacramento Democrats, Woodland Democratic Club, and Sacramento Stonewall Democrats. Besides this impressive list, he has also received the endorsement of Planned Parenthood Northern California Action Fund, Reproductive Freedom for All California, Sierra Club, and Equality California. With the current threats to reproductive freedom, LGBTQ rights and climate change, he is needed to keep California’s laws strong. But what makes Cabaldon an impressive candidate is his history of being the longest serving mayor of West Sacramento, during which the city received distinction as “America’s most interesting small city” and “America’s most livable small city” as well as recognition as one of the world’s “21 Smart Cities to Watch.” Under Cabaldon’s leadership, innovative initiatives were started, including guaranteed universal access to preschool, urban farms, free college for local students, sustainable land use, building market and affordable housing at one of the fastest rates in California — all while shrinking its footprint and protecting even more habitat and agricultural land. He also served as the chair of the Jobs, Education and Workforce Committee at the U.S. Conference of Mayors and appointed to the National Advisory Board by president Obama, which was chaired by Dr. Jill Biden, for America’s College Promise. All this makes him a great choice for the next state Senator and worthy of your consideration. — Andrew Smith/Benicia",
