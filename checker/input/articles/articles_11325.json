    "text": "A record number of runners raised a record sum for the fight against cancer at the Luxembourg Times BusinessRun on Thursday.\nMore than 6,600 runners from more than 400 companies put on their trainers on Thursday evening for a 5km run through the heart of Luxembourg City’s business district in Kirchberg.\nWith the sun slowing setting, Luxembourg Times editor-in-chief Cordula Schnuer rang the starting signal at 19:00.\n“It’s great to see so many people come together for a good cause,” she said. “We’re proud to be part of this event that is all about team spirit and reaching a common goal.”\nWith €2 of every registration fee collected for charity, the BusinessRun raised €36,262 for the Fondation Cancer, which support cancers patients and their families in Luxembourg as well as funding research in the fight to prevent and cure the disease.\nThe fastest teams were rewarded with special prizes, with awards handed to:\nSauerBeen Asport – with Gil Weicherding, Bob Bertemes and Luc Scheller - for the fastest men’s team,\nLes Gazelles de l’INLL – with Elsa Eiller, Silvia Cano and Sabrina Masciocchi - the fastest women’s team,\nPwC Team 2- with Joffrey Perrot-Legros, Yohan Maurin and Emma Waechter - the fastest mixed team.\nThe INLL and PwC teams upheld their company record, with teams from both organisations also winning last year.\nSpeed wasn’t the only winning formula though. The Gym Tonics received the prize for the most creative team name, while runners dressed in Titanic costume were rewarded for the best costume.\nThe Chamber of Skilled Trades of Crafts sponsored a special Handwierk prize, which went to Gio-Go Go (Nelson Ferraz, Antonio Barros and Natalia Faria).\nThe latest edition of the run broke last year’s record when 5,400 runners participated.\nWith the after party getting in full swing, the Luxembourg Times hosted hundreds of thirsty and hungry runners to fuel the crowd.\nBNP Paribas once again sent the largest team into the race, with 680 employees from the company taking part, up from 291 last year. Clearstream followed in second place with 292 runners and ArcelorMittal coming third with 161.\nMore pictures to follow",

    "text": "Rishi Sunak delivered a powerful maiden speech as the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons on July 9. Sunak began his speech by congratulating newly elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer for his victory. He further said 'sorry' and apologised to his party members who were not re-elected. Sunak promised that his party would undertake their new role as the official opposition with professionalism, effectiveness, and humility. Addressing the parliament, Sunak said, \"In our politics we can argue vigorously as I and Prime Minister did over the past six weeks but still respect each other. Whatever disputes we may have in the parliament I know that everyone in this house I know that everyone in this house will not lose sight of the fact that we are all motivated by our desire to serve our constituents, our country, and advance the principles that we honourably believe in. Every member new and old I congratulate them for the results....My advice to all members is to appreciate the role that you have everyday that you have it... For those of us at my party let me begin with a message to those who are no longer sitting behind me...I am sorry. We have lost too many diligent community-spirited representatives whose wisdom and expertise will be missed in the debates and discussions ahead... Now we will take up the crucial role of official opposition professionally, effectively and humbly.\"",

    "text": "HOME OLYMPICS Coach stood down after spying furore; ‘sabotage’ claim in whipping scandal — Olympics Daily Matildas thumped, Men's 7s advance! | 00:54 Fox Sports with AFP from Fox Sports July 26th, 2024 12:28 pm\nCanada defender Vanessa Gilles insisted her team were “not cheats” despite a spying scandal before their 2-1 opening win over New Zealand in the Olympic women’s football competition on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, New Zealand complained to the International Olympic Committee’s integrity unit after claiming drones were flown over the team’s closed practice sessions in Saint-Etienne.\n“Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” Canada Soccer chief executive and general secretary Kevin Blue said in a statement.\nHead coach Bev Priestman has been removed from the country’s Olympic team in response to the drama, with assistant coach Andy Spence leading the Canadian team for the remainder of the Paris Games.\nFellow assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joey Lombardi were also sent home from the Games in Paris on Wednesday. Lombardi has been given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session in Saint-Etienne in the build-up to the match.\nFIFA has since opened disciplinary proceedings against Canada.\n“Honestly, it wasn’t easy,” Gilles told reporters.\n“There was a lot of emotion, frustration and humiliation because as a player, it doesn’t reflect our values and what we want to represent as competitors at the Olympics.\n“The Games represent fair play. As Canadians, these are not our values or those of our country. We are not cheats. It was very hard but we knew how to be united.”\nCanada are defending their Olympic title in Paris after defeating Sweden to win gold in Tokyo three years ago.\nCanada coach Bev Priestman. Photo by William WEST / AFP Source: AFP\nFRESH ‘SABOTAGE’ CLAIM IN OLYMPIC SCANDAL\nThere are fresh claims British Olympian Charlotte Dujardin was sabotaged on the eve of the Paris Games after footage of her alleged animal abuse went public.\nEarlier this week, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) suspended Dujardin, the joint most-decorated British female Olympian, after the video was released.\nThe vision, first released by Good Morning Britain , was taken four years ago and showed the 39-year-old beating a horse with a long whip during a training session with a young student.\n“A video has emerged from four years ago which shows me making an error of judgement during a coaching session,” Dujardin said in a statement .\n“Understandably, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports is investigating and I have made the decision to withdraw from all competition — including the Paris Olympics — while this process takes place.\n“What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.”\nHorse welfare charity Brooke dropped Dujardin as an ambassador, with the London International Horse Show following suit. Meanwhile, two of Dujardin’s sponsors confirmed they had ended their arrangements with her — riding helmets manufacturer Charles Owen and Fairfax Saddles.\nHowever, former dressage correspondent at Horse & Hound magazine Madeline Hall has suggested the three-time gold medallist may have been sabotaged as mystery continues to swirl about the whistleblower’s identity.\n“The timing of this video days before the Olympics smells of sabotage,” Hall told The Daily Mail .\n“To me it is suspect.”\nDujardin was due to compete in both the individual dressage and the team event in Paris. She been replaced in the team by Becky Moody.\nNew tactics backfire on Matildas | 05:20\nNADAL’S FRESH INJURY SETBACK\nRafael Nadal has suffered a thigh injury to put his participation at the Paris Olympics in doubt, his coach Carlos Moya said on Thursday.\nThe 14-time French Open champion is scheduled to play in the singles and in the men’s doubles alongside rising star and fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros.\n“He had some discomfort yesterday (Wednesday) morning,” Moya told Spanish radio.\n“In the afternoon he was more limited and before it got worse he decided to stop.”\nThe 38-year-old Nadal did not train on Thursday, which Moya said was “the most responsible thing to do”.\n“Don’t force it at the moment and see if he recovers well,” he added.\n“We will see what condition he’s in tomorrow and Saturday.”\nNadal returned to tennis this year after a lengthy absence with a hip injury, reaching his first ATP final since winning the 2022 French Open in Bastad last weekend before losing to Portugal’s Nuno Borges.\nHe is scheduled to face Hungarian Marton Fucsovics in the singles first round on Sunday, the day after partnering Alcaraz in the doubles.\nIf Nadal defeats Fucsovics, he would set up a possible second-round meeting with old rival Novak Djokovic.\n“I can’t guarantee anything, neither that he won’t play or he will play,” said Moya.\n“At the moment he needs to rest, undergo treatment.\n“He is obviously very excited to play these Olympics. It has been something marked on his calendar for years.\n“He is a born competitor and wants to play singles and doubles. He’s very excited about the doubles with Alcaraz. It will be the first time they have played together and it will be something historic for Spanish tennis.”\nNadal is a two-time Olympic champion, having won singles gold in Beijing in 2008, and doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Games alongside Marc Lopez.",

The company’s decision to raise its payout to $0.45 per share, coupled with its leadership position in natural gas compression services, positions it as a compelling play in the energy infrastructure sector.\nDividend Increase: A Vote of Confidence in Cash Flow Stability\nOn April 23, 2025, Kodiak announced its first-quarter dividend of $0.45 per common share, marking a $0.04 increase from the $0.41 per share paid in Q4 2024. This is the company’s second dividend hike in 12 months, underscoring its commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining financial discipline. CEO Mickey McKee emphasized that the increase reflects the “strength of Kodiak’s business model and stable cash flows” generated by its role as the largest contract compression services provider in the U.S.\nThe dividend payment, set for May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 5, aligns with Kodiak’s strategy to reward investors while deleveraging and expanding its fleet. The company’s Adjusted EBITDA of $609.6 million in 2024 and its 2025 guidance of $685–725 million further support its capacity to sustain dividend growth.\nQ1 2025 Earnings: A Critical Test of Resilience\nKodiak’s Q1 2025 earnings release, set for May 7, 2025, will provide the first glimpse into how the company is performing in 2025. Analysts project EPS growth of 89% year-over-year to $2.12 for 2025, driven by strong demand for natural gas infrastructure services. The earnings call on May 8 will likely address:\n- Operational performance: Revenue trends, margins, and utilization rates of compression units.\n- Market conditions: Demand for services in key basins like the Permian, where Kodiak focuses on oil-driven projects.\n- Strategic priorities: Fleet expansion plans, cost management, and capital allocation strategies.\nWhy Investors Should Monitor the Conference Call\nThe earnings call will be pivotal for gauging Kodiak’s ability to navigate industry dynamics. Key topics to watch:\n1. Natural gas demand trends: Rising global energy demand, particularly in export markets, could drive compressor demand.\n2. Competitive positioning: Kodiak’s fleet size and technology edge over peers.\n3. Debt reduction progress: The company aims to reduce leverage, and any updates on this front will influence investor sentiment.\nRisks and Considerations\n- Commodity price volatility: Natural gas and oil prices directly impact demand for compression services.\n- Regulatory shifts: Environmental policies could alter infrastructure priorities.\n- Competitor actions: Rival companies may undercut pricing or secure contracts faster.\nConclusion: A Solid Bet on Energy Infrastructure Resilience\nKodiak’s dividend increase and upcoming earnings release paint a positive picture of its financial health and strategic execution. With a 10% dividend boost and $685M–$725M Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $150 billion U.S. natural gas infrastructure investment pipeline through 2030.\nInvestors should focus on the May earnings call for clarity on:\n- Whether Q1 results align with the $2.12 annual EPS consensus, which would represent a significant growth leap from 2024’s $1.12.\n- Management’s outlook on Permian Basin activity, a key growth driver.\n- Debt reduction progress, which could further stabilize its balance sheet.\nIn summary, Kodiak’s dividend hike and earnings outlook reflect a company leveraging its leadership in a critical energy sector. For income-focused investors, the 10% dividend growth and historically stable cash flows make KGS a compelling option, provided earnings confirm the bullish narrative. The May 8 conference call will be the next critical step in validating this thesis.\nFinal Takeaway: [kodiak gas] Services is emerging as a standout player in energy infrastructure, combining dividend growth with exposure to a sector vital to global energy needs. Investors should prioritize the earnings results and management commentary to assess its trajectory in 2025 and beyond.",
