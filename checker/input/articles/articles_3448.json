    "text": "JOHNSTOWN — A 2023 report on veteran suicides released by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs suggested suicide among veterans is on the rise. There were 6,392 veteran suicide deaths in 2021 — 114 more than in 2020, according to the report. On West Main Street in Johnstown, the Vet-to-Vet Center, backed by the Mental Health Association in Fulton and Montgomery Counties under the Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Foundation, opened this summer seeks to help veterans who are at risk of suicide. PFC Joseph P. Dwyer was an Iraq combat medic from Long Island, who returned from the war with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ended up taking his own life in 2008. As a result, then-state Sen. Lee Zeldin from Long Island led the initiative to launch the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Project, which began first in Suffolk, Jefferson, Saratoga and Rensselaer counties, in order to help veterans meet with other veterans in a secure, comfortable atmosphere to help each other cope with the effects of PTSD and TBI. State funds for the program were first a part of the 2012 New York state budget. The program has since expanded to even more counties across the state, including Fulton and Montgomery counties. The program's veteran-to-veteran approach allows for complete anonymity without fear of reprisal. It utilizes peer support from those who can relate to the struggles of transitioning into civilian life. And its goal is to link veterans for socialization and friendship. The non-clinical program does not provide case management for individuals. However, it does connect veterans with other service providers in the community if there is a specific need. Tom Elwood, program director for the Fulton County chapter, is himself a veteran. The St. Johnsville High School graduate joined the National Guard in 2004, and later deployed to Iraq in 2009 as military police sent to train Iraqi police in combat operations. He was honorably discharged in 2012. “The sole purpose behind the program is to prevent veteran suicide,” he said. Just last week, a 30-year-old National Guardsman who was getting ready to deploy again took his own life, Elwood said. “We are reaching out to those still serving and veterans because it matters,” he said. With approximately 4,000 veterans residing in Fulton County, the program is highlighting the need for solidarity for mutual support. “Let the veteran know they are not alone. There are some hidden in the woodwork but know this — that we are here’” he said. When someone deploys, their life changes, Elwood explained, and this is a factor in suicide. “One of the biggest issues is that most veterans like to have firearms. They stay away from the clinical aspect for fear their weapons will be taken away,” Elwood said. He said when veterans talk to each other it is a whole different lingo, a whole language of their own. Among the programs and partnerships is with a fitness club. Elwood hopes to create a family support group. And there are plans to take a trip to Pine Tree Rifle Club. The center at 128 West Main St. is open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. “We don’t turn anyone away,” Elwood said. -",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| Chennai | Updated: 09-03-2024 18:21 IST | Created: 09-03-2024 18:21 IST - Country: - India The widow of an IAF aviator, who perished along with India's first CDS General Bipin Rawat in a chopper crash in the Nilgiris, and a civil engineer from an agrarian family were among scores of cadets who underwent gruelling training at the Officers Training Academy here and become commissioned officers in the Indian Army on Saturday. Shauryan Thapa, the sixth generation member of his family to don the Army uniform and the youngest (21 years) candidate in the academy, too, was among the 184 officer cadets, who completed the training. He was awarded the OTA gold medal at the passing out parade today. Shauryan would join his father Col Mohit Thapa in serving the 7/8 Gorkha Rifles. Yashwini Dhaka, daughter of an Army man, married Squadron Leader Kuldeep Singh, a pilot of the Indian Air Force's Workhorse Mi-17V5 multi-role helicopter, in 2017 and was content with her married life. But fate willed otherwise. Four years later, Kuldeep Singh took off from the Air Force Station, Sulur near Coimbatore, to fly Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat to the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, Udhagamandalam. However, barely minutes before the chopper was to touchdown at the destination on December 8, 2021, the twin-engine helicopter crashed in the hilly Nilgiris killing the passengers on board. Singh, too, died along with the CDS and others. This tragedy altered the life of Yashwini and she chose to don the olive green uniform. ''Conventionally, the OTA intake is for those aged 21 and 27. This Veer Nari had to get acclimatised to an all new life while keeping up with her batch mates much younger than her,\" a release from the OTA said. Recovering from her personal loss, she become an Army officer to make her husband proud. In the case of Saranya M, from an agrarian family in Tamil Nadu's Erode district, a career in the Indian Army seemed to fascinate her. This civil engineer and also the first graduate in her family spurned her job in an IT firm and opted to train at the OTA and become a commissioned officer.

    "text": "An ex-Mormon OnlyFans creator has opened up about some of the church’s biggest secrets—including their infamous “magic” undergarments.\nKari Keone, aka @spaceghost on social media, spoke out about her experiences in a series of recent posts on X.\nVideos by VICE\n“They’ll lie about this stuff because they’re embarrassed,” she said of the Mormon church. “The whole religion is a joke.”\nKeone was raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the ’90s. She married a Mormon husband when she was just 22.\nAdult Mormons wear magic underwear\nThe online creator described one encounter with the church’s “temple garments” when she was living with her in-laws early in the marriage.\n“We lived with my Mormon mother-in-law and father-in-law for a bit because my husband had some debt we were paying off,” Keone recalled. “I accidentally touched his dad’s magic underwear doing laundry and his mom cut the runes out of it and burned them in the backyard.”\nTemple garments are two-piece white undergarments worn by adult members of the LDS church. The church’s official website likens their significance to a “nun’s habit” or a “Jewish prayer shawl.”\n“To Church members, the modest temple garment, worn under normal clothing, along with the symbolic vestments worn during temple worship, represent the sacred and personal aspect of their relationship with God and their commitment to live good, honorable lives,” the site’s statement continues.\nHowever, Keone seems to have no fond memories of her experience with the garments.\n“One cool factoid about the magic underwear is that you’re never supposed to take it off,” the adult entertainer and Twitch streamer noted. “This includes sex. You’re supposed to have sex with the underwear on at all times.”\nThere’s little public information about the rules around the magic underwear\nUltimately, Keone said, her feelings about the Mormon church stem from her own personal experiences.\n“I want to clarify for all my religious followers that religion is like clothing to me,” she said in later X posts. “Just because I don’t like your shirt doesn’t mean I’m going to mock you for it. It’s a personal choice.”\n“However — I was abused by the Mormon Church and so I have carte blanche to say and do as I please,” she continued. “I left the church when I was 13 but it still had a vice grip on me emotionally until I was about 22. A lot of ex Mormons make it their personality but people who have been following me for years had no idea I was Mormon. It’s obviously not a huge point of interest for me.”",

I ​think that, for ​me, it makes me feel awful; I don’t eat ⁢well, I​ eat rubbish ⁢for days, and you⁣ kind of waste a‌ day away.”\nFinding Your Own Balance Ultimately,⁣ Williams’ story⁤ is a testament ‍to the ‍power⁢ of balance. it’s⁤ not about ​perfection ⁤but ‍about finding sustainable habits that nourish both​ body and mind. What steps do you take to achieve balance in your own life?",

Korea ask for help Posted September. 27, 2024 07:58, Updated September. 27, 2024 07:58 Families of S. Korean and Japanese abductees in N. Korea ask for help. September. 27, 2024 07:58. by Woo-Sun Lim imsun@donga.com. In Manhattan, New York, where the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly is being held, two sets were set up in the shape of a family home in North and South Korea, respectively, on Wednesday (local time). On chairs placed in front of them, five people who have lost family members to North Korea told their stories over an hour in trembling voices. At the North Korean human rights roundtable, “Forget Me Not,” organized by the nonprofit Korea Society, family members of abductees and detainees from South Korea and Japan took the stage to speak out about North Korea’s human rights abuses. North Korean defector Son Myong-hwa shared the story of her father, a prisoner of war who died after decades of forced labor in a North Korean coal mine. “I brought his remains to South Korea in 2013 in accordance with his will, but in return, my older brother, younger sister, and nephew were sent to political prison camps,” Son said, crying. “I defected from North Korea in 1998, but my younger sister was forcibly repatriated from China last year,” Kim Gyu-ri said in a shaky voice. ”I ask for help from the international community to find my sister.” Teruaki Matsumoto, the younger brother of Rumiko Matsumoto, a Japanese woman abducted by North Korea from a beach in Japan in 1978, and Kim Jung-sam, the older brother of Missionary Kim Jung-wook, who was captured by North Korea in 2013 during his missionary work, also participated in the meeting and expressed their families’ desperate wait. Several overseas Koreans who attended the meeting also shared their stories, saying they also have family members in North Korea, and asked for the international community’s help. The meeting was attended by Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul, special envoy on North Korean human rights issues in the U.S. Department of State Julie Turner, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Dafna Rand. “The phrase ‘Forget Me Not’ is a cry of desperation from victims of human rights abuses and a voiceless cry from the people of North Korea,” said Minister Cho. “We are grateful for the sacrifices and courage of those who continue to work in the shadows to share news about their loved ones detained in North Korea,” he said. “For more than 70 years, Korea has been divided in two, experiencing a brutal social experiment that has shown us what the absence or presence of free human rights and democracy can do to a human being,” he added. ”We will strongly express our concern about the human rights situation in North Korea, as well as the plight of unconverted long-term political prisoners, prisoners of war, and forcibly repatriated North Korean defectors, at the Universal Periodic Review in November.” “The majority of the separated families are elderly, in their late 80s and 90s,” Assistant Secretary Rand said. ”We are committed to returning to the negotiating table with North Korea unconditionally, with a sense of urgency that time is running out.” Font size down Font size up 한국어 Share this article on Facebook Share this article on Twitter In Manhattan, New York, where the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly is being held, two sets were set up in the shape of a family home in North and South Korea, respectively, on Wednesday (local time).

    "text": "The new plant-based soft gel will launch on Friday, January 19, providing Arizona consumers with a unique and innovative capsule option.\nAlly Biotech, dba Life Is Chill, a science-based provider of leading-edge bioactive delivery solutions for cannabinoids, today announces the launch of its live resin soft-gel capsules, ResinTime, under its Life Is Chill product line. The initial offering to the market is vegan-friendly, a new innovative soft gel based on a tapioca-starch and sugar-free product that addresses some of the dietary needs of consumers. The launch of live resin capsules marks a new era for soft gels in the Arizona market and will meet the increasing demand for products made from fresh-frozen cannabis.\n“Capsules are an increasingly popular choice for those seeking a smoke-free and sugar-free product, but the common practice of using gelatin in pills makes them inaccessible to people who prefer plant-based products or people that have allergies to bovine gelatin,” said Francis Baczek, President at Life Is Chill. “Our newest addition to the Chill Pill product line solves this problem with the additional benefit of high-quality live resin.”\nThe ResinTime soft gels will officially launch on January 19th, 2024, at The Superior Dispensary in Phoenix. The vegan-friendly ResinTime is the company's newest addition to its current portfolio of easy-to-swallow THC soft-gel capsules, which includes six other variations: Day Caps, Night Caps, Anytime Caps, Anytime Hybrid+, Extreme Caps, and THCa Caps.\n“We are honored to kick off the launch of these live resin soft gels, a first of its kind in the Arizona market,” said Steve Shapiro, founder and CEO of The Superior Dispensary. “As a vegan, I’m excited to have a vegan-friendly product available for consumers. These capsules will provide another great option for customers seeking new ways to consume live resin-based products in an easily digestible way.”\nThe award-winning soft gel brand is available in dozens of dispensaries across the state and has cemented itself as an Arizona staple for almost a decade. With the global cannabis capsule market expected to reach $108.14 billion by 2029, according to Data Bridge Market Research, and at least 6% of the American population identifying as either vegetarian or vegan, this new launch will meet the growing demand for dietary-friendly live resin products and provide an inhalation-free and sugar-free method of consumption for Arizona cannabis users.\nThe new product launch follows Ally Biotech’s acquisition of the Chill Pill line in the spring of 2023. It continues the company’s plan to expand its product line and establish itself as a market leader in the soft gel category.

Formulated using hemp seed oil, Chill Pills are sugar-free, easy to absorb and metabolize, and come in various strengths and strains, with effects ranging from highly responsive to highly relaxed.

    "text": "Les principales centrales syndicales des centaines de milliers de travailleurs de l'industrie automobile du Canada et des États-Unis sont plus que jamais divisés sur la position à adopter face aux derniers tarifs douaniers imposés par Washington.\n• À lire aussi: Tarifs sur les automobiles non américaines: «Je ne vois pas comment cela pourrait être calculé facilement»\n• À lire aussi: Tarifs: chute généralisée des géants de l'automobile en Bourse\n• À lire aussi: Les tarifs automobiles américains pourraient être revus à la baisse\nAux États-Unis, la puissante United Automobile Workers (UAW) n’a pas tardé hier à crier «victoire pour les travailleurs» aussitôt la confirmation par le président Trump de l’imposition de nouveaux tarifs de 25% sur les importations de véhicules pour passagers (autos et camions) aux États-Unis.\nCette «annonce victorieuse» pour l’industrie, qui doit entrer en vigueur le 2 avril prochain, «marque le début de la fin d'un désastre de plus de trente ans lié au libre-échange », exprimait hier les hautes instances du syndicat des travailleurs de l’automobile, dans un communiqué diffusé en soirée.\n« Nous félicitons l'administration Trump d'avoir pris des mesures pour mettre fin au désastre (...) qui a dévasté les communautés ouvrières pendant des décennies, a déclaré le président de l'UAW, Shawn Fain. Pour mettre fin au nivellement par le bas dans l'industrie automobile, il faut d'abord réparer nos accords commerciaux rompus, et l'administration Trump est entrée dans l'histoire avec les mesures prises aujourd'hui»,\n«Ces droits de douane, a-t-il poursuivi, constituent un pas important dans la bonne direction pour les travailleurs de l'automobile et les cols bleus à travers le pays, et il incombe maintenant aux constructeurs automobiles, des trois grands [GM, Ford et Stellantis] à Volkswagen, et au-delà, de ramener de bons emplois syndiqués aux États-Unis.»\nTrump n'a aucun droit, selon Unifor\nAu même moment, le syndicat canadien Unifor, qui représente les membres de l’ancien syndicat des Travailleurs canadiens de l’automobile (TCA/CAW), tenait un discours complètement opposé, qualifiant les tarifs douaniers d’«attaques injustes contre l’économie canadienne» et ses travailleurs.\n« Donald Trump s'est mis dans la tête qu’il devait s'approprier les emplois des travailleurs canadiens de l'automobile, a déclaré dans un communiqué la présidente nationale d'Unifor, Lana Payne. Nous fabriquons des véhicules ici au Canada depuis plus d'un siècle (...). Je tiens à le dire le plus clairement possible: ces emplois ne lui appartiennent pas et il n'a aucunement le droit de venir nous les prendre. »\nLes nouveaux tarifs douaniers sur les véhicules automobiles doivent entrer en vigueur le 2 avril. Selon certains renseignements, les tarifs douaniers sur les véhicules automobiles seraient appliqués en fonction de la valeur du contenu non américain composant les véhicules, une mesure qui violerait selon Unifor, les termes de l’ACEUM, l’Accord commercial liant le Canada, les États-Unis et le Mexique.\nLes Machinistes contre Trump\nLe président Trump «lance attaque, après attaque, après attaque, a déclaré Mme Payne. Nous n'avons aucune raison de croire que notre relation commerciale avec les États-Unis puisse un jour redevenir ce qu'elle était par le passé, ce qui signifie que nous devons nous forger une nouvelle économie axée sur la création et des mesures qui soutiennent les empois canadiens. »\nDe son siège d’Upper Marlboro, au Maryland, l'Association internationale des machinistes et des travailleurs de l'aérospatiale (AIM), qui compte 600 000 membres, tant aux États-Unis qu’au Canada, exhortait hier le Sénat américain à mettre fin aux tarifs douaniers.\n«L'utilisation des tarifs douaniers peut être une mesure d'application efficace pour sanctionner les mauvais acteurs commerciaux, comme les pays qui ne respectent pas les droits des travailleurs, reconnaissait des États-Unis son président, Brian Bryant. Ces nouveaux tarifs sur le Canada, l'un de nos alliés les plus proches et l'un de nos plus grands partenaires commerciaux, sont injustes et auront des impacts négatifs durables sur les travailleuses et travailleurs américains et canadiens.»",

    "text": "[ NBA ](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/category/news/) Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga disagrees with the amount of minutes he’s received this season Before the start of the 2023/24 NBA campaign, all eyes in Golden State were on [Jonathan Kuminga](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba/players/jonathan-kuminga/), as he was expected to finally have his breakout season. However, to have breakout performances, you need to be given the opportunity, and so far the young star has been placed mostly on rotation, instead of as a starter for the Warriors. After only being given 23 minutes against the Denver Nuggets on Christmas Day, the 21-year-old expressed his frustrations with the press. During his time on the court, he was able to drop 13 points, win 5 rebounds and handed out two assists in his team’s loss against the reigning champions. “Yeah, I am a difference-maker,” Kuminga expressed. “I know I am. But it’s not up to me to do certain things. How can I say it? It’s not up to me to control my minutes. I feel like I’ve done that. But the last voice ain’t mine. And it’s not easy because I know how to score the basketball. I know how to pass. I know how to do different things on the floor.” Kuminga saying this after dropping 13 points and finishing a -24 even with the Nuggets sleepwalking is wild.

With the people we have on the floor, it’s just tough to put it all together. I’m trying to figure out how to manage that,” he added. Jonathan has known for quite some time that this season will be time for him to either make it or break it in California, as he aspires to become a fundamental part of the Warriors and prove everyone he’s got what it takes to someday dominate the NBA. During the summer he admitted this to ESPN’s Leonard Solms at the Basketball without Borders camp in South Africa, revealing there is a lot of expectation surrounding his performances this current campaign. “This upcoming season is definitely the year,” he said back in August. “A lot of people are expecting so much from me – and myself; I’m expecting a lot. It’s a lot of pressure, but I don’t really pay attention to the noise. The pressure is always going to be there. It’s just [on] me to go out there and perform.” The Warriors coach wasn’t bothered by his player’s remarks and believes they were in good faith Despite what many thought was a direct attack on Steve Kerr, the [Golden State](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba/teams/golden-state-warriors/) coach assured he didn’t interpret Kuminga’s comments as disrespectful towards him. He’s actually convinced that the 21-year-old acted in good faith and simply wants to contribute more to the Bay Area club. After Jonathan expressed his displeasure about Kerr’s rotation, including receiving inconsistent minutes, Kerr responded with ease. “I wasn’t really offended by the comments,” he said. “I think JK meant well. I think it may have come out maybe a little differently than he intended. But it’s all good. We talk every day.” Kerr’s answer came after Wednesday’s team practice, as the Warriors are currently preparing to face the Miami Heat this Thursday at the Chase Center. Golden State are currently sitting in the Western Conference’s 11th spot with a 15-15 record. - [Pistons vs. Celtics Odds, Picks, & Predictions (Dec. 28)](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/pistons-vs-celtics-odds-picks-predictions-dec-28/) - [MVP Joel Embiid isn’t too impressed with Victor Wembanyama: ‘Everything feels a little forced’](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/mvp-joel-embiid-isnt-too-impressed-with-victor-wembanyama-everything-feels-a-little-forced/) - [Pelicans, Smoothie King renew arena naming rights contract](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/pelicans-smoothie-king-renew-arena-naming-rights-contract/) - [NBA Lost Christmas Day Ratings Battle Against NFL For 4th Straight Year](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/nba-lost-christmas-day-ratings-battle-against-nfl-for-4th-straight-year/) - [Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga disagrees with the amount of minutes he’s received this season](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/news/warriors-forward-jonathan-kuminga-disagrees-with-the-amount-of-minutes-hes-received-this-season/) 1 day ",
