    "text": "A massive tropical wave forming off the American coastline has hurricane trackers on high alert - with Florida potentially getting hit next. The tropical wave, named Invest 97L by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), now has a 70 percent chance of development, and may potentially evolve into a full-blown hurricane. The system is currently dumping rain on Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. But its sights may soon be set on the Sunshine State. Meteorologist George Waldenberger told Channel 9 News it most likely will develop this weekend or early next week. &#039;For now, expect a higher chance of heavier rains Sunday, Monday and possibly beyond,&#039; he said. &#039;Strong storms may be possible with this disturbance nearby in the same time frame.&#039; A massive tropical wave forming off the American coastline has hurricane trackers on high alert - with Florida potentially getting hit next The tropical wave, named Invest 97L by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), now has a 70 percent chance of development, and may potentially evolve into a full-blown hurricane Waldenberger said he is still &#039;watching to see where circulation emerges and how organized this system can become by early next week.&#039; &#039;Water temperatures are in the upper 80s, adding plenty of fuel for this system to grow into Debby - possibly even a hurricane by late weekend and early next week near our west coast,&#039; Chief meteorologist Tom Terry told Channel 9 News Thursday morning. &#039;Heavy rain and worse (is possible) with this scenario for the Sunshine State,&#039; he added. The tropical rainstorm currently lacks a well-defined center but shows signs of organizing as it moves towards Florida. Meteorologists expect the storm to strengthen as it moves away from Cuba, with warm waters potentially fueling it&#039;s wrath from late weekend to early next week. The tropical storm has already drenched northern Caribbean islands and is set to soak Cuba and the western Bahamas by Friday. The system is currently dumping rain on Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. But its sights may soon be set on the Sunshine State (Pictured: rain storm at Veteran&#039;s Memorial Marina Park on Thursday, July 11, 2024, in downtown Safety Harbor) A woman walks along the beach of Manresa, covered with garbage after the passage of Hurricane Beryl, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, 3 July 2024 Damaged boats lie on the land and water in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, Thursday, Sept. 29, 2022, in Fort Myers, Fla Cubans repair a roof in San Juan y Martinez, Pinar del Rio Province, on September 27, 2022 after the passage of Hurricane Ian Florida&#039;s forecast calls for downpours and gusty thunderstorms to hit the Keys and southern peninsula by Saturday, with an increased risk of tropical storm or hurricane conditions from Sunday onwards, AccuWeather reported. The exact track of the storm remains uncertain. It could hit Florida&#039;s east coast or veer into the Gulf of Mexico, depending on how quickly it intensifies. This comes after at least eight people died and more than 2.7 million were left without power when Hurricane Beryl swept into Texas and up the Mississippi valley at the start of the month. And after weeks of relative calm the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has warned that its successor, named Debby, could be brewing east of the Lesser Antilles. &#039;The chances of tropical development have bumped up to 40 percent within seven days,&#039; tweeted the Texas Storm Chasers. A contractor surveys a Dallas-based client&#039;s home for structure damage after Hurricane Beryl moved through the area in Galveston, Texas on July 8, 2024 &#039;Folks anywhere along any part of the Florida coastline ought to keep an eye on this. August looks busy as it tends to often be!&#039; The NHC first raised the alarm on Friday after spotting the tropical disturbance and seeing it was likely to clash with an approaching tropical wave. The chances of it developing have nearly tripled since then with Weather Jamaica issuing a code Orange and warning that &#039;Debby is imminent&#039;. Forecast maps show the storm sweeping across the Caribbean and across Florida if it develops, but warn it could make land anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico or the Carolinas. A large area of high pressure near Bermuda could force it into Texas while another over the southern plains could force it up the eastern seaboard. Read more",

    "text": "▶ Watch Video: Questions rise over new Texas immigration law as border sees spike in migrants\nThe Biden administration on Thursday warned Texas that it will sue the state if it implements a\nstrict immigration law known as SB4 that would empower state and local law enforcement officials to arrest, jail and prosecute migrants suspected of entering the U.S. unlawfully.\nThe Justice Department said it would file a lawsuit against\nSB4 if Texas did not assure federal officials by Jan. 3 that the state would refrain from enforcing the law as planned in March, according to a letter sent to Gov. Greg Abbott on Dec. 28 and obtained by CBS News. In addition to creating illegal entry crimes at the state level, the law would allow Texas judges to issue de facto deportation orders.\nIn its letter, the Justice Department said SB4 would effectively criminalize actions that are already illegal at the federal level, undermine relations with Mexico and prevent officials from enforcing federal immigration laws, including those designed to grant refuge to migrants fleeing persecution.\n“Because SB 4 is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government’s operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott.\nIf Texas does not heed the Biden administration’s demand, “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4,” Boynton warned.\nRepresentatives for Abbott, who signed SB4 earlier this month after the measure was passed by the Texas legislature, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SB4 is already being challenged in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has also argued the law is unconstitutional.\nWhat would SB4 allow Texas to do?\nSB4 is the latest attempt by Texas to challenge President Biden on immigration. Under Abbott, Texas has transported tens of thousands of migrants to New York City, Chicago and other Democratic-led cities, tasked National Guard units to fortify the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned state troopers to arrest some migrants on trespassing charges.\nThe measure would be the strictest state immigration law in modern U.S. history, making unauthorized immigration a state crime, ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony.\nEntering Texas illegally from Mexico would be treated as a misdemeanor crime, punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,000. Illegal reentry into Texas would be a felony offense, punishable with up to 2, 10 or 20 years in jail, depending on whether the migrant in question had been previously deported or convicted of certain crimes.\nSB4 would also allow Texas magistrates to order migrants suspected of violating the illegal entry or reentry laws to return to Mexico as an alternative to continuing their prosecution. Those found to violate those orders could be charged with a second-degree felony.\nThe Mexican government has already said it would not accept returns of migrants from Texas state officials, denouncing SB4 as an “anti-immigrant” law.\nAbbott and other supporters of SB4 have argued the law will deter illegal border crossings. He and other Republican leaders have faulted the Biden administration for the unprecedented levels of migrant crossings recorded over the past three years.\nBut critics of the law have said it will lead to racial profiling of people who look like migrants. They’ve also argued SB4 could backfire from a public safety perspective, overwhelming state and local jails and diverting law enforcement officials away from efforts to arrest serious criminals.\nRead the full letter below:",

    "text": "While consumers are no strangers to phishing emails, fraudulent SMS messages, and social media scams, the scale and complexity of cyberattacks aimed at critical sectors go far beyond these relatively simple threats.\nBy John Mc Loughlin, CEO of J2 Software\nEntire industries and governmental bodies face increasingly sophisticated attacks, which can cripple essential services, cause economic damage, and compromise sensitive data on a massive scale.\nUnderstanding the sectors most frequently targeted by cybercriminals can offer insights into the breadth and nature of these threats, highlighting the need for vigilance, investment in security, and proactive measures.\nAccording to data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents (ERCI), critical infrastructure – facilities and services vital to the functioning of society – has become a prime target for cybercriminals. These infrastructures span everything from healthcare and finance to telecommunications and energy.\nLet’s dive into the key sectors targeted by cybercrime, and take a closer look at the various cybersecurity challenges.\nCritical infrastructure: Cybercrime’s primary target\nCritical infrastructure is the lifeblood of modern society, providing essential services that people rely on daily. This makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals, who seek to disrupt, steal, or hold these services hostage in exchange for financial gains or other motives, such as political or ideological agendas.\nIn 2023, critical infrastructure was the most frequently attacked sector, according to ERCI. These cyber incidents range from ransomware attacks that lock systems until a ransom is paid to sophisticated breaches that steal sensitive data or cause system-wide disruptions. Statista’s report, based on ERCI data, emphasises just how much damage can be done when vital services come under attack.\nHealthcare: 14,2% of critical infrastructure attacks\nAmong the sectors of critical infrastructure, healthcare stands out as a primary target. The healthcare industry, which includes hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities, accounted for 14.2% of all attacks on critical infrastructure in 2023. The motivations for targeting healthcare organisations vary but often involve ransomware attacks, theft of confidential patient records, and disruptions to healthcare services.\nRansomware is a particularly devastating tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals targeting healthcare organisations. Attackers encrypt essential systems and files, demanding hefty sums to restore access. For healthcare providers, the stakes are incredibly high – lives can literally hang in the balance. The disruption of care services, delays in medical treatment, and the potential exposure of personal healthcare information create a nightmare scenario for both patients and healthcare administrators.\nOne recent high-profile example involved the Clop ransomware gang, which targeted hospitals and healthcare organisations by exploiting vulnerabilities in widely-used file transfer software. This attack paralysed hospital operations, forcing many to delay patient treatments or turn away non-emergency cases.\nFinancial organisations: 8,3% of attacks on critical infrastructure\nThe financial sector also remains a lucrative target for cybercriminals, accounting for 8.3% of attacks on critical infrastructure in 2023. Financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and investment firms are natural targets because of the vast sums of money they manage, as well as the wealth of sensitive data they store.\nCyberattacks in this sector can take multiple forms, including:\nPhishing attacks aimed at obtaining login credentials for online banking or investment platforms. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm a bank’s online services, making them inaccessible to customers. Data breaches that expose personally identifiable information (PII) or financial details, leading to identity theft and other forms of fraud. For instance, a well-coordinated attack on a large European bank this year resulted in a data breach that exposed millions of customer records. While the bank was quick to mitigate the breach, the reputational damage and financial loss were significant.\nTelecommunications, transport, and energy sectors\nThe telecommunications, transport, and energy sectors also fall within the crosshairs of cybercriminals, with attacks occurring regularly in 2023. These sectors play crucial roles in ensuring that communication networks function, people and goods can move, and societies have access to power and fuel. A well-executed cyberattack against any one of these sectors can have far-reaching consequences.\nTelecommunications companies have been hit by a combination of DDoS attacks, data breaches, and ransomware, often targeting critical communication infrastructure or sensitive customer data. The transport sector, particularly airlines and rail systems, have seen an increase in cyberattacks aiming to disrupt logistics and operations. The energy sector, including utilities providing electricity and fuel, remains a particularly worrying target because of the potential for large-scale blackouts or fuel supply disruptions. In 2023, several European energy companies reported being victims of cyberattacks designed to compromise operational systems and extort ransom payments.\nState institutions and political systems: The second most common target\nAfter critical infrastructure, state institutions and political systems are the next most common targets for cyberattacks, according to ERCI, with more than 450 reported incidents in 2023. Cybercriminals, state-sponsored attackers, and hacktivist groups have increasingly turned their attention to government systems in pursuit of sensitive information or to sow chaos and disinformation.\nState institutions often face spear-phishing campaigns, where government employees are tricked into giving up passwords or access to sensitive systems. Some attacks, particularly those backed by nation-states, aim to infiltrate defence systems, steal military secrets, or disrupt diplomatic communications.\nAdditionally, election interference and politically motivated attacks have continued to plague democratic systems. Countries across Europe and North America have reported attempts to manipulate voter data or spread disinformation during elections. These attacks often involve the exploitation of social media platforms and targeted disinformation campaigns designed to sow discord among the population or influence voting behaviour.\nCybersecurity strategies: How to stay ahead\nWith the relentless rise in cyberattacks, organisations and governments have been forced to adopt stronger cybersecurity measures. The cyber threats facing critical infrastructure and state institutions have necessitated the following key strategies:\nEnhanced Endpoint Security: With more devices connected to corporate and institutional networks than ever before, endpoint security is becoming a central focus. Advanced endpoint protection tools, powered by machine learning and AI, can detect and stop threats before they reach sensitive systems. Zero Trust Architecture: As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated, many organisations are adopting Zero Trust models, which assume that no user or device—internal or external—can be trusted by default. Access is only granted after careful authentication, and users are continually monitored to ensure they pose no risk to the system. Backup and Disaster Recovery: For sectors like healthcare, where service disruption can be catastrophic, ensuring regular data backups and establishing robust disaster recovery plans are essential. Many ransomware victims have been able to recover more quickly thanks to having secure backups in place. Cybersecurity Awareness Training: Human error continues to be a major vulnerability. Ongoing training programs help employees recognise phishing attempts, social engineering, and other tactics used by cybercriminals. The increase in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, state institutions, and political systems is a stark reminder that no sector is immune to the rising tide of cybercrime. As attacks grow in frequency and sophistication, organisations must bolster their cybersecurity defences with proactive measures.\nWhether through enhanced technology, stricter access controls, or comprehensive employee training, businesses and governments alike must stay vigilant to mitigate the ever-evolving threats posed by cybercriminals.\nThis serves as both a wake-up call and a roadmap for how industries can protect themselves against increasingly dangerous digital threats.",

    "title": "Vermont GOP rules bar it from promoting any candidate who is a ‘convicted felon'",
    "text": "The Vermont Republican Party is prohibited from backing a candidate with a felony conviction, according to the party’s publicly posted rules .\nThat is now a bit of a problem, since the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was recently convicted on 34 felony counts .\n“The state committee will not support or promote any candidate for elective office who … is a convicted felon,” read the rules, which govern everything from party meetings to how delegates must vote at national conventions.\nOn social media, the party does technically appear to be following the rule — there are no mentions of Donald Trump on the Vermont GOP’s Twitter or Facebook pages in the days since the former president’s historic guilty verdict in his hush money case — but the party’s social media typically talks only about local candidates and presidential candidates who visit the state.\nThe rule has been on the books since at least 2013, according to an archived version of the rules, but by early 2022, the party appears to have amended their rules.\nDonald Trump Jun 5 Trump's gun license expected to be revoked after conviction in hush money trial Donald Trump Jun 5 Trump Georgia election case halted pending outcome of challenge to D.A. According to the Internet Archive, the posted rules were changed by March 2022 to allow the state committee to exempt a candidate from the rule by majority vote.\nIt’s unclear if such a rule will affect how Vermont’s GOP delegates vote at the Republican National Convention in July.\nFormer U.N Ambassador Nikki Haley won all of Vermont’s delegates but suspended her campaign in March; she has since endorsed Trump. The party rules dictate that delegates to the RNC are not bound if a candidate withdraws or suspends their campaign.\nThe Republican National Committee and Paul Dame, chair of the Vermont Republican Party, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn 2022, when Trump announced his bid for the presidency, Dame said in a statement that he did not believe Trump was the right choice for the party.\n“I believe that the best thing for the future of the party is for other qualified and accomplished Republicans to join the primary to give Republican voters a better choice in the 2024 election,” he said.\nIn a statement, the Democratic National Committee suggested Vermont Republicans instead support President Joe Biden in November.\n“We already knew Donald Trump was a threat to the American people and our democracy, but according to the Vermont GOP’s own rules, Donald Trump isn’t even eligible to receive their support,” Deputy Communications Director Abhi Rahman said. “We look forward to the Vermont Republican Party supporting Joe Biden this November — the only candidate with a path to 270 that has not been convicted of a felony.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

Elle laisse un enfant de 6 ans, Etienne\nLa date du 7 juin 1944 restera gravée à jamais dans les mémoires biterroises. Ce jour-là, sur le Champs-de-mars, devant la maison natale de Jean-Moulin, 18 résistants, dont Juliette Cauquil, 25 ans, furent fusillés par les Allemands devant la population de Béziers rassemblée de force.\nLa veille, alors qu'ils partaient rejoindre le maquis Latourette, sur la commune de Ferrières-Poussarou, ils avaient été faits prisonniers, lors d'une embuscade tendue par l'ennemi, dans la montée du col de Fontjun, entre Cébazan et Saint-Chinian. Roger Cauquil, l'époux de Juliette, faisait aussi partie des prisonniers. Les deux résistants ont laissé un enfant, Etienne, alors âgé de 6 ans.\nSon mari fusillé sous ses yeux\nStéphane, le fils d'Etienne et petit fils des deux résistants, raconte les dernières minutes de la vie de sa grand-mère : \"Sur intervention de la Croix Rouge et des autorités locales, elle devait être graciée. Mais à bout de nerfs, alors qu’elle venait de voir son jeune mari, Roger Cauquil, fusillé sous ses yeux et qu’elle consolait, en l'embrassant, le plus jeune des résistants de 17 ans en pleurs, elle a eu une altercation avec l'officier allemand qui commandait le peloton d'exécution. Hors d'elle, elle l'insulta et lui cracha au visage. Elle fut aussitôt menée sur le peloton pour rejoindre les cinq derniers résistants qui allaient être fusillés.

    "text": "La start-up britannique Firefly a annoncé ce jeudi 11 avril qu'une première usine mondiale de biocarburant à partir d'eaux usées allait ouvrir, tout en se félicitant de ne jamais manquer de matière première. L'utilisation du produit n'est, à ce stade, pas autorisée. \"Partout dans le monde où il y a des gens, il y a du caca.\" Un constat simple et une promesse pour une aviation plus verte. L'entreprise britannique Firefly a annoncé la création d'une première usine mondiale transformant les eaux usées en carburant pour avions à Harwich, dans l'Essex, comme l'a relayé ce jeudi 11 avril Sky News .\nFirefly s'est donné un objectif: fournir du carburant à faible teneur en carbone à partir de 2028. Un accord a déjà été signé avec la compagnie hongroise Wizz Air, qui finance le projet, pour la livraison de 525.000 tonnes de carburant d'aviation durable (SAF) en 15 ans.\n92% de gaz à effet de serre en moins Ce SAF est un biocarburant dont la production nécessite 70% de carbone en moins que le carboréacteur habituel. Il peut se mélanger à 50% avec du kérosène sans que les moteurs d'avions n'aient à être modifiés.\nTout au long de sa vie, ce carburant alternatif émet jusqu'à 92% de gaz à effet de serre de moins que les combustibles fossiles, selon les calculs de Firefly.\n\"Nous transformons les eaux usées en carburéacteur. Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait à beaucoup de choses plus sympas que cela\", a clamé James Hygate, directeur général de l'entreprise. Il a ajouté: \"Cette nouvelle façon d'aborder les SAF a le potentiel de faire bouger les choses, et d'être une contribution significative à l'approvisionnement en SAF au Royaume-Uni. Pas seulement au Royaume-Uni bien sûr. Partout dans le monde où il y a des gens, il y a du caca.\"\nPour l'instant, Firefly est dans l'attente d'une autorisation pour alimenter les avions avec son invention. Mais les autorités encouragent ce genre de découvertes et innovation. Le gouvernement britannique a d'ailleurs signé un mandat obligeant les compagnies aériennes à utiliser au moins 10% d'énergies durables d'ici 2030.\nThéo Putavy Les plus lus\nPonts de mai: puis-je télétravailler ailleurs qu’à mon domicile?",
