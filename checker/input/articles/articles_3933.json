In a brief news release on Wednesday, the NWT’s wildfire agency said the danger would be particularly high in Fort Liard and the surrounding region, including Nahanni Butte.\n“Most of the South Slave and Dehcho are expected to reach moderate fire danger as temperatures rise and we continue to dry out,” NWT Fire stated.\n“In all areas in the south of the territory, we expect some periods of high winds – which can be problematic even at low or moderate levels of fire danger. That means for the south of the territory, conditions are here to support new starts and fast growth.”\nThere are no active fires at the moment.\nNWT Fire said person-caused fires are usually “the biggest issues” in May, appealing for people to avoid fires in high or extreme fire danger regions unless absolutely necessary for food or warmth.",

    "title": "Boeing Workers Walk Off the Job in First Strike Since 2008",
    "text": "Thousands of Boeing workers walked off the job on Friday after rejecting a contract offer from the company, a potentially costly disruption as Boeing tries to increase airplane production after a safety crisis.\nThe strike, the first at Boeing in 16 years, is expected to bring operations to a halt in the Seattle area, home to most of Boeing’s commercial plane manufacturing. The slowdown could also further disrupt the company’s fragile supply chain.\nKelly Ortberg , the company’s new chief executive, had urged employees to approve the deal. “A strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers,” he said in a video statement on Wednesday.\nBoeing plays a substantial role in the U.S. economy. It employs almost 150,000 people across the country — nearly half of them in Washington State — and is one of the nation’s largest exporters. The company, which also makes military jets, rockets, spacecraft and Air Force One, is a global symbol of America’s manufacturing strength.\nThe union said the strike vote passed by 96 percent, well above the two-thirds required to initiate a walkout. Ninety-five percent of voters rejected the deal.\nThe proposed contract had been agreed upon by union leaders and company management on Sunday after months of talks. It included many gains for workers, but fell short of what the union initially sought. Union leaders had hoped to get bigger raises and other concessions from the company, but said it was still “the best contract we’ve negotiated in our history.”\nIn a statement on Friday after the vote, Boeing said it was “committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union.” The company said it was “ready” to continue negotiations on a new labor contract.\nA vast majority of the 33,000 workers governed by the contract are represented by District 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Members of that union, Boeing’s largest, mostly work on commercial airplanes in the Seattle area. The dispute also involves workers in the Portland, Ore., area who are represented by the union’s smaller District W24.\nThe union represents about a fifth of the company’s more than 170,000 employees worldwide.\n“This is about respect. This is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,” said Jon Holden, the president of District 751.\nMr. Holden had said in a statement several days before the strike that union leaders had recommended approving the deal because “we can’t guarantee we can achieve more in a strike.” He added then that the union would “protect and support” whatever decision the members make.\nMr. Ortberg, who joined Boeing last month, has sought to reset the company’s relationship with its workers and met with employees in the Seattle area this week to hear their thoughts about the deal. Other pressing issues include improving quality and safety, restoring the company’s reputation, fixing its relationship with regulators and improving its financial position, which includes reducing its nearly $60 billion in debt.\nThe last Boeing strike, in 2008, lasted 50 days; the contract that ended the dispute has been extended twice. If the current strike lasts about as long, it will cost Boeing at least $3 billion, according to an estimate from Cai von Rumohr, a research analyst at the investment bank TD Cowen.\nBoeing operates two large factories in the Seattle area: one in Renton, where it makes the 737 Max, and another in Everett, where it makes the 767 and 777 .\nThe Max, by far Boeing’s most popular model, accounts for more than three-fourths of the 5,490 planes the company has on order. But output at the Renton factory is far behind where Boeing wants. The company has been forced to slow production to make quality improvements after a panel fell off a Max being used for an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Eventually, Boeing plans to expand Max production to Everett.\nThe rejection of the proposal on Thursday reflects resentment among workers over concessions made in past talks, including the loss of pension benefits a decade ago, which the union had sought to reinstate. Workers and the union were also angered by the company’s decision in 2009 to move final assembly of its 787 Dreamliner plane to a nonunion factory in South Carolina.\nBut many in the union were not around for those events: About half the members of District 751 have less than six years of experience at the company. Those workers generally earn less than their more experienced peers, which may make a strike financially difficult, even with the union’s offer to pay members $250 per week starting in the third week of the strike.\nThe proposed deal would have delivered raises of 25 percent over the life of the four-year contract; the unions started the talks by asking for raises of 40 percent. Some workers who started from a lower base wage would have received bigger raises; for about 7,500 workers, pay would have increased 45 percent, while another 5,000 workers would have received raises of 53 percent, according to Boeing.\nThe rejected deal also would have provided each union member with a $3,000 ratification bonus. Boeing had also agreed to increase annual payments to the union 401(k) plan by up to $4,160 per worker, cover more of the cost of health care, provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave and make improvements to work-life balance, including reductions in mandatory overtime. The company also agreed to commit to building its next commercial plane in the Pacific Northwest.\nIn rejecting the deal, workers may feel they have an upper hand as Boeing seeks to move past the crisis that began when the panel fell off a 737 Max. While no one was seriously injured in that incident, it reignited concerns about the quality and safety of Boeing’s planes five years after two fatal Max crashes led regulators worldwide to ground the plane for nearly two years.\nAfter the January episode, the Federal Aviation Administration limited production of the Max. The company has since increased inspections, added training for new hires, started to simplify procedures and limited tasks performed out of sequence, a practice known as traveled work.\nBoeing’s employees may also have been more willing to vote for a strike because they were emboldened by recent walkouts involving autoworkers, screenwriters and actors.\nThe post Boeing Workers Walk Off the Job in First Strike Since 2008 appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "Atta girl. If you’ve had a rough deer season… you’re not gonna want to read this… According to [WCCO](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2017/12/20/2-deer-1-shot/), an 11-year-old Minnesota girl shot two deer with one shot while hunting with her father in Lyon County a couple years back. And here’s the kicker… it was only her second time hunting. Her father Andy described the scene: “She spotted a buck in the trees coming down the path.” With a .20 gauge shotgun in hand, one she had never fired before, young Skyla took aim at the buck who was coming her way, and then came to a standstill about 30 yards from their blind. And little did she know, a doe was right behind the target buck. “I waited and finally the buck stood straight and I took a shot at him. The buck fell over and the doe behind it fell over too.” Her dad had a doe tag he could slap on the downed deer, but it was absolutely the surprise of a lifetime for the proud dad: “I stared at them for two minutes and I can’t believe that happened. I’d never heard of it. It’s possible it’s happened before.” How about it? Only her second time hunting and she bags two deer with a single shot. I mean, how many hunters drag their butt out to the tree stand every morning, nearly freeze to death and don’t see a single living thing? A LOT of them, that’s how many. Dad should probably think about taking her to the casino, throw a little on black? Maybe have her pick a few numbers for the lottery… strike while the iron is hot, you know? Of course, for young Skyla, she was able to form a core memory so early in her hunting experience, and I can guarantee you that she’ll be hooked for life. Imagine if she sits out there with her dad and doesn’t see a deer? Maybe she wants to get back in the blind next year, maybe she doesn’t… but the ol’ two-fer will guarantee it. Gotta love it.",

    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) -Workers at Volkswagen (ETR: VOWG_p ) could go out on strike across Germany as soon as next week, the IG Metall union said in a notice on Friday, as a clash between labour and management over layoffs and plant closures escalates.\n\"Strikes are possible and also necessary from the beginning of December,\" IG Metall said in a handout to workers seen by Reuters, adding an existing agreement not to stage walkouts will end on Nov. 30.\nWarning strikes at the carmaker's plants across Germany are expected to take place as soon as Monday, according to people familiar with the matter, which would mark the first large-scale walkouts at the company's domestic operations since 2018. Warning strikes usually last from a few hours up to a day.\nVolkswagen has demanded a 10% wage cut, arguing it needs to slash costs and boost profit to defend market share in the face of cheap competition from China and a drop in European car demand. It is also threatening to close plants in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history.\nLabour representatives and management will meet again on Dec. 9 to carry on negotiations over a new labour agreement for workers at the German business - VW AG - with unions vowing to resist any proposals that do not provide a long-term plan for every VW plant.\nThe strikes, which could escalate into 24-hour or unlimited strikes if a deal is not struck in the next round of wage negotiations, will put a dent in Volkswagen's output at a time when the carmaker is already facing declining deliveries and plunging profits.\n\"Volkswagen will determine at the negotiating table how long and how hard the conflict will be - the VW workforce throughout the country is ready to strike,\" IG Metall said.\nA proposal by unions to avoid redundancies and plant closures through measures including reduced working hours and forgoing bonuses will form the basis of the discussions. Still, management has said it is not ready to take plant closures off the negotiating table.",
