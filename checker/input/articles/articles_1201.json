Molecular POC tests offer quick results, enabling prompt treatment and containment of infectious outbreaks. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of infectious diseases and cancer in both developed and developing regions is set to favor the expansion of the point-of-care molecular diagnostics market. Moreover, the growing inclination towards preventive medicine further contributes to the anticipated rise in demand for point-of-care molecular diagnostics throughout the forecast period.\nChallenges: Limited Reimbursement Policies\nInadequate reimbursement coverage for molecular POC tests by public and private payers can hinder market growth. Reimbursement policies may not fully reflect the value of POC testing in terms of improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and resource utilization, discouraging healthcare providers from investing in these technologies. One of the significant challenges faced by diagnostic companies is obtaining payment from Medicare and private health insurers for their tests. In the United States, Medicare revised its reimbursement mechanism for certain in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests, including point-of-care molecular tests 2018. Furthermore, Medicare currently does not provide coverage for genetic testing in individuals without a personal history of cancer, as indicated by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. These factors are anticipated to have an adverse impact on the point-of-care molecular testing market.\nNorth America Is Expected To Grow With the Highest CAGR during the Forecast Period\nThe North America Molecular Diagnostics Point of Care Market is likely to register a significant revenue share and to develop at a rapid CAGR in the near future. This is due to the increasing incidence of infectious diseases, increasing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments product approvals, and expanding legislative measures that are driving this market’s expansion in North America. The ongoing efforts of major market players to strengthen their position are a significant contributing factor. Several clinical trials will contribute to market growth throughout the projection period due to the diversity and precision of contemporary molecular tests. Furthermore, , this region is expected to continue growing as the demand for rapid and accurate diagnostic solutions increases, supported by technological advancements, regulatory initiatives, and evolving healthcare delivery models.\nSegmentation of Molecular Diagnostics Point of Care Market-\nBy Test Location-\n- Over-the-counter (OTC)\n- Point of Care (POC)\nBy Technology-\n- PCR Based\n- Genetic Sequencing Based\n- Hybridization-Based\n- Microarray-Based\n- Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT)\nBy Applications-\n- Infectious Disease Testing\n- Oncology\n- Hematology\n- Prenatal Testing\n- Endocrinology\n- Others\nBy End Users-\n- Decentralized Labs\n- Hospitals & Clinics\n- Home Care Settings\n- Assisted Living Healthcare Facilities\n- Emergency Medical Services (EMS)\n- Others\nBy Region-\nNorth America-\n- The US\n- Canada\n- Mexico\nEurope-\n- Germany\n- The UK\n- France\n- Italy\n- Spain\n- Rest of Europe\nAsia-Pacific-\n- China\n- Japan\n- India\n- South Korea\n- Southeast Asia\n- Rest of Asia Pacific\nLatin America-\n- Brazil\n- Argentina\n- Rest of Latin America\nMiddle East & Africa-\n- GCC Countries\n- South Africa\n- Rest of Middle East and Africa\nFor More Customization @\nhttps://www.insightaceanalytic.com/customisation/1423\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name:\nInsightAce Analytic Pvt.

    "text": "转自：新安晚报\n　　横排头渠首枢纽。\n　 淠史杭灌区是中国重要的综合性水利工程之一，也是世界灌溉工程遗产的代表性项目。67年间，润泽江淮、庇佑民生、续建改造，淠史杭工程交出了一份亮眼的“成绩单”，河水奔涌向前，灌区也迎来了新时代的全新挑战——朝着现代化灌区建设持续迈进。3月9日以来，记者走访梅山水库、横排头渠首枢纽等地，看到了淠史杭在“十四五”续建配套与现代化改造新征程上谱写着绚丽新篇章。\n　　【梅山水库】加快建设数字孪生水库\n　　梅山水库坐落于享有“红军故乡、将军摇篮”之誉的金寨县县城南端，3月9日，记者看到这里春色怡人、水光潋滟，吸引了不少游客前来游玩。\n　　记者了解到，淠史杭灌区以五大水库（佛子岭、梅山、响洪甸、磨子潭、龙河口）为核心，通过2.5万公里渠道构成“长藤结瓜”式网络。作为淠史杭灌区主要水源之一，梅山水库始建于1954年3月，1956年4月建成，大坝高88.24米，全长443.5米，当时堪称世界第一高连拱坝。\n　　如今，梅山水库不仅是一座以防洪、灌溉为主，结合发电等综合利用的大（1）型水利工程，也是国家4A级景区，水库景区丰富的“绿色”旅游资源同县域“红色”革命传统紧密相连，形成了自己独特的旅游文化。\n　　梅山水库建成以后，始终担负着为淮河干流蓄洪错峰的重要任务，保护人口100余万、耕地约500万亩，相继战胜了1969年、1991年、2003年、2005年和2016年的大洪水。河南固始县，六安市的霍邱县、金寨县、裕安区、叶集区等383万亩的农田也在此后有了水源保障，据安徽省梅山水库管理处简介介绍，水库累计为灌区供水近700亿立方米，使下游灌区农田实现旱涝保收。\n　　近年来，梅山水库聚焦水利数字赋能、防汛智治，持续推进水利管理信息化、数字化工作，不断升级水雨情测报系统，采用超短波+GPRS+北斗三信道，实现水雨情的实时监测、精准预警。目前，水库已建设水雨情自动采集站点11座，开发应用水库管理一体化信息系统，推动信息技术与水利业务深度融合，高效开展防汛抗旱、水库安全管理等专项业务。\n　　2024年，梅山水库率先启动数字孪生水库试点建设工作，据梅山水库管理处工程科有关负责人介绍，此次工程建设用时约两年，“下一步，将根据建设方案，布设Web⁃GIS三维水库信息可视化模型，逐步建设完善水库监测站点，构建起梅山水库气象卫星和测雨雷达、雨量站、水文站组成的雨水情监测预报‘三道防线’，逐步实现水利管理核心业务智慧化管理。”据了解，通过数字孪生水库（梅山水库）建设，将为加快构建梅山水库现代化水库运行管理矩阵、推动安徽水利高质量发展、保障水安全提供有力支撑和强力驱动。\n　　【横排头渠首枢纽】再度智能化升级改造\n　　3月10日下午，位于六安市裕安区苏家埠镇的横排头风景区内游客络绎不绝，清澈的水流缓缓顺着溢流坝流向古淠河河道。\n　　来到横排头风景名胜区，不得不先认识横排头水利枢纽工程。安徽省淠史杭灌区管理总局横排头管理处助理工程师陈仕凯向记者介绍，早在六七十年前，古淠河河床低洼，两岸多高岗丘陵，天旱时很难进行自流灌溉，连日阴雨又容易发生涝灾，“这就陷入了‘旱时盼水水不来，涝时恨水水不走’的境地，1958年淠史杭综合利用工程开始建设，第一抔土就是在这里动工。”\n　　“淠史杭工程发挥灌溉作用的关键，是兴建渠首枢纽工程，抬高水位，逼水上岗。”陈仕凯说，横排头渠首枢纽于1958年8月动工，1959年7月竣工，整个枢纽由溢流坝、土坝、总干渠进水闸、冲砂闸及船闸五部分组成，“它们像一把锋利的长剑，将古老的淠河拦腰截断，将雨季的水积蓄在闸内，形成丰源湖，在下游需要用水时按需分配，实现引水灌溉。”\n　　陈仕凯介绍，现在由于雨水不多，只有少量水流流向古淠河，起到生态保护的作用，“等到7月前后的丰水季节，湖水外溢，通过溢流坝形成小型瀑布，那时的景色才叫美呢。”\n　　在景区内的淠史杭工程展览馆记者了解到，横排头上游水源主要为响洪甸水库和佛子岭水库。水流通过横排头渠首，从苏家埠出发，与江淮分水岭并驱东行，穿六安城直过，直抵皖中，为千万居民提供优质水源，灌溉了约660万亩农田。1959年至2024年，横排头渠首累计灌溉引水约1089亿立方米，灌溉面积2.92亿亩，水稻产量约2248亿斤，为区域经济社会发展发挥了不可替代的作用。\n　　2022年，横排头枢纽工程进行了数字孪生试点建设，通过构建渠首枢纽数字孪生场景，实时分析预测渠首枢纽水位、流量变化及行洪能力，提高了渠首工程运行安全和水资源管理水平。“此次改造提升工程中，我们对枢纽再度进行了智能化升级改造，如今，枢纽对上游水势和下游分配用水的掌握更加精准。”陈仕凯说。\n　　【现代化改造】软硬件多管齐下\n　　随着时间的推进，被称为“新中国水利史上的奇迹”的淠史杭灌区也面临全新的挑战，如何建设“节水、生态、智慧、共享、魅力”的现代化淠史杭灌区成为新的课题。\n　　2021年开始，淠史杭灌区迈入“十四五”续建配套与现代化改造新征程。据安徽省淠史杭灌区管理总局基本建设处处长汪鹤林介绍，在“十四五”期间，灌区建设进入现代化改造阶段，批复概算总投资22.98亿元，共59个项目。截至目前已下达投资11.9亿元，共实施了27个项目，余家河渡槽、九里沟渠下涵、聚星渡槽等一大批骨干建筑物通过续建配套与现代化改造的实施得以更新改造，保障了渠道的输水安全。\n　　安徽省淠史杭灌区管理总局规划计划处处长贺亚斌告诉记者，淠史杭灌区“十四五”续建配套与现代化改造所要实现的目标可以用十六个字来概括，即“设施完善、节水高效、管理科学、生态良好”。贺亚斌介绍，淠史杭灌区现代化改造在2024年已被列入国家水利气象领域“两重”建设标志性工程清单，这次改造以灌区水资源优化配置为核心，同步推进灌区灌排体系改造、农业水价改革、水农融合以及数字孪生灌区的提升改造。\n　　从历史中走来，淠史杭始终未歇；向未来奔去，淠史杭使命在肩。\n　　未来，淠史杭将基本完成灌区分干渠以上骨干工程配套达标和30万亩以上灌区现代化改造试点，建成淠史杭数字灌区，加快灌区水系联通，在全省率先建成数字灌区，在全国率先推进现代化灌区改造试点，建设国内领先、国际知名的现代化灌区，为实现乡村振兴和生态文明建设做出更大贡献。\n　　新安晚报安徽网大皖新闻记者龚润泽孙召军摄影报道",

    "text": "PADUCAH — Despite the heat, humidity, and occasional rain showers, fairgoers did not let the weather dampen their spirits as they showed up for day two of the McCracken County Fair.\nThe fair, which brings many locals and visitors from around the region, also supports local organizations and nonprofits through sales and participation. Darrell Matheny, president of the McCracken County Fair, said that although the rain has come and gone, fair officials had safety procedures already in place.\n\"If the lightning comes back up, they'll shut the rides down, and we'll get the people back, and then they can have arm stamps so they can get back in once it clears out,\" Matheny said.\nThe fair features food stands, rides, game booths, and special events scheduled daily. Due to the excessive heat, the fair canceled the wiener dog race on Tuesday night, but Matheny said for now, each special event will still run.\n\"We have wrestling going on here tonight. It's delayed for a bit, but it'll be going on here shortly,\" Matheny said. \"Thursday night, we have Chandler Roberts — he'll be under the top, so rain won't affect him. Then Friday night we have the Enduro, which starts at 7. Saturday night is the demo derby. At 8 o'clock in the morning, we have the second annual McCracken County Car Show.\"\nMultiple fights broke out at one of the fairs last year, which resulted in injured sheriff's deputies and juveniles being taken into custody. Due to the incident, Matheny said officials are bringing back old safety policies.\n\"Kids under 17 have to have an adult with them, and we have arm bands that signify that,\" Matheny said. \"We also have a clear bag policy that, you know, can only be so big and see-through.\"\nStudent volunteers with the Kentucky YMCA Y-Corps were at the fair Wednesday night. Rayleigh Houghland said the goal is to help wherever needed.\n\"What we do is we travel around Kentucky doing service projects and basically just serving back to our community,\" Houghland said.\nAlthough group members did not know they would end up at the fair, Houghland said the group is helping by picking up any trash that is being littered.\n\"We say, 'Participate. Don't anticipate,' and so this was actually kind of a surprise for us, but once we got here, we were like, 'Let's get this show on the road. Let's do it. Let's get the work done,'\" Houghland said.\nShe reminds anyone attending the fair throughout the week to pick up their trash and to drink water. She said the heat and humidity are bad, so she wants everyone to stay safe.\nFor more information about the McCracken County Fair, and a full list of the organizations and nonprofits benefiting from the sales, visit the website or Facebook.",
