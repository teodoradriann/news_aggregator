    "text": "Eastern Iowa family to provide hot meals to Hurricane Helene victims URBANA, Iowa (KCRG) - The Getty family operates the Country Cooking Concessions food truck. For the next few days they will bring hot meals to the community in Asheville, North Carolina. Asheville is one of the cities that has taken the brunt of destruction from Hurricane Helene. “We know the destruction and damage that a flood can do. So, we’re hoping to show North Carolina some Iowa love,” Jim Getty said. This isn’t Getty’s first time helping hurricane victims. His family fed Hurricane Ian victims in Florida in 2022. “Sometimes you were laughing with the people and they were in great spirits. Other times you cried with them because they lost everything they owned,” Getty said. Getty lost 250 acres of crops this past storm season, but it hasn’t stopped him from helping those less fortunate. “It doesn’t matter where we’re standing, if we have the ability to do it, that’s what we’re going to do. And luckily two years ago we could do it and we’re going to do it again this time too,” Getty said. In fact, the Getty family wants to be able to eventually help when every devastating event strikes. “The more people, the more donations, the more support, that’ll definitely gives us an advantage to do more of these disasters. That is definitely our goal,” Getty said. You can find information on how to contact the Getty family to support and donate to the cause on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Countrycookingconcessionsbc). Copyright 2024 KCRG.

    "text": "TULSA, OK — Worship at a local church was noticeably more subdued this last Sunday morning, as the pastor gently informed the band's drummer that a triple bass pedal wasn't really needed for \"Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing.\"\nPastor Mike Young's attention was reportedly drawn to the sanctuary during the worship team's rehearsal due to the rapid-fire kick drum beat echoing through the halls of the church, leading him to pull the drummer aside before service to tactfully break the news to him.\n\"It's a little stronger than the song calls for,\" Pastor Young said. \"It's not that you're lacking in skill. Heavens, no. We're thrilled to have you on the worship team. You're a great drummer. It's just… the triple bass pedal. Might be just a little bit of overkill for ‘Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing.' You get me? It's a very soothing, melodic song. Not really ripe for machine gun bass.\"\nDrummer Stephen Brock was disappointed but exhibited appropriate submission to his pastor. \"I thought the song could be taken up a notch,\" he said. \"I felt like the triple bass pedal really added something to the old hymn and could really get the whole congregation thumping. But he's my pastor. I'm under his authority, so I'll have to save the triple bass pedal for something else.\"\nAt publishing time, Pastor Young was planning to have another sit-down with Brock to discuss the rumor that he was planning to use the triple bass pedal during \"Blessed Assurance\" instead.\nWorld, meet Travis.

    "text": "Apple’s latest iOS update introduces a new security feature that automatically reboots iPhones after 72 hours of inactivity.\nTechCrunch has confirmed that iOS 18 includes a new “inactivity reboot” feature. This feature forces iPhones to restart if they remain unlocked for 72 hours. Jiska Classen, a researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute, demonstrated this functionality in a video, showing an iPhone rebooting itself after being left untouched for three days.\nSee the latest iOS inactivity reboot in action!\niOS 18 comes with improved anti-theft measures. Three days w/o unlock, the iPhone will reboot, preventing thieves from getting your data. (1/4) pic.twitter.com/H24Tfo1cSr\n— Jiska (@naehrdine) November 13, 2024 When an iPhone reboots, it enters a “Before First Unlock” (BFU) state, where the user’s data is fully encrypted and nearly impossible to access without the passcode. This makes it a lot harder for anyone without permission—like the police and theives—to get into the device.\nThis feature boosts security but could be tricky for those who forget their passcodes. Or for those who have multiple devices with each having a different passcode. After a reboot, you’ll need to enter your passcode to unlock your device since Face ID or Touch ID won’t work until then.\nThe new feature has law enforcement and forensic experts worried—it automatically reboots iPhones into a more secure, tougher-to-access mode, making it harder for them to get into seized devices.\nIn short, it might be a hassle for some and add a bit of complexity to investigations, but it gives much better protection against unauthorized access. Your data is safer than ever, at least if it is offline.\nMore here.",

    "text": "‘Astronomical’ warming in Nunavut forecasts temperatures above zero next week\nWarm winds pushing up from the south will bring unseasonably warm readings in parts of the territory\nWhile many other places across the North shiver in the cold, unusually warm weather is in the forecast for much of Nunavut through the weekend and into early next week.\nWarm winds pushing up from the south are expected to bring temperatures to above zero in some parts of Nunavut, and Iqaluit is expected to reach a high of 4 C on Monday, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.\nHigh winds, reduced visibility and unsafe road conditions were expected Friday night, according to the City of Iqaluit, which issued a warning to residents to stay indoors.\n“If we’re looking at what our normal temperatures would be on Monday, that’s maybe 30 degrees above normal,” said Jesse Wagar, a warning preparedness meteorologist with the federal government’s environmental department.\n“That is just an astronomical amount of warming that this weather system is pushing towards the North.”\nBy Thursday, the forecast in Iqaluit drops to -13 C, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.\nBut while Nunavut basks in the relative warmth, western areas like the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Alberta are dealing with extreme cold temperatures and severe weather warnings.\nIn some parts of Alberta, an Arctic blast coming from the North may cause temperatures to feel as low as -50 C.\n“These sorts of highly amplified flow patterns, we do see them often enough that they’re pretty normal to see through the winter,” Wagar said.\n“But the extent of this one, like how cold it has been through the Northwest Territories and Alberta, and how warm it’s going to be in southeastern Nunavut and Nunavik, is unusual.\n“Some of the temperatures we’re seeing in Alberta are the coldest since the ’70s. This is not normal.”\nWagar says it’s difficult to attribute this weather event to climate change, but notes climate change is bringing more frequent and extreme weather events.\nThe warm temperatures carry a chance of rain in Nunavik, and federal government is recommending Nunavimmiut exercise caution for dangerous icy conditions early next week.",

    "title": "Permaculture Agriculture Boosts Biodiversity",
    "text": "RPTU University of Kaiserslautern-Landau has shown for the first time, in a joint study with BOKU University, that permaculture indeed brings about a significant improvement in biodiversity, soil quality and carbon storage. In view of the challenges of climate change and species extinction, this type of agriculture proved to be a real alternative to conventional cultivation - and reconcile environmental protection and high yields.Permaculture uses natural cycles and ecosystems as blueprint. Food is produced in an agricultural ecosystem that is as self-regulating, natural and diverse as possible. For example, livestock farming is integrated into the cultivation of crops or the diversity of beneficial organisms is promoted in order to avoid the use of mineral fertilizers or pesticides. In a recent study, published in the journal “Communications Earth & Environment”, researchers from RPTU and BOKU have now for the first time comprehensively investigated the effects of this planning and management concept on the environment. \\\"Although permaculture projects have been established all over the world since the 1970s, there has been surprisingly little accompanying scientific research,\\\" explains environmental scientist Julius Reiff from RPTU the background to the study. \\\"We wanted to close this gap and investigate whether permaculture actually has the repeatedly-assumed positive effects on the agricultural ecosystem in practice.\\\"Permaculture: clear benefits for biodiversity and soil qualityThe research team examined a total of nine farms in Germany and Luxembourg. The scientists examined various indicators of biodiversity and soil quality on the permaculture areas of these farms and on reference areas of the otherwise predominant agriculture nearby. To this end, soil samples from the plots were analyzed in the laboratory for their organic carbon content, micro- and macronutrients and the activity of soil microorganisms. The biodiversity of earthworms, birds and plants was determined as a measure of biodiversity.According to the study, the soil quality and biodiversity on the permaculture plots was distinctly higher compared to the surrounding conventional agricultural land as well as compared to the literature values for conventional agriculture. The carbon and humus content of the permaculture soils was roughly comparable to the values in grassland in Germany. Grassland is considered an important reference, as it typically has the highest humus content of agricultural or forestry areas in Germany.A high humus content in the soil is important for nutrient and water storage - a key factor in times of climate change, for example to withstand periods of drought. Although no mineral fertilizers were used on the permaculture areas, their soils had a higher soil nutrient content. This is also beneficial for human health: \\\"The higher nutrient levels in the soil suggest that these are also higher in the crops produced,\\\" says Julius Reiff.In addition to the soil quality, biodiversity also benefits: the researchers found three times more bird species on the permaculture areas than on the reference areas of the region's predominant agriculture. They also identified three times more earthworms and a higher biomass of soil microorganisms, which are essential for decomposition and nutrient conversion in the soil. Compared to conventional agriculture, the researchers found three times the number of plant species on the permaculture areas. This is a good indicator of the overall biodiversity of an ecosystem and at the same time the food base for important species groups such as pollinators or the natural antagonists of pests.Want more breaking news?Subscribe to Technology Networks’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.A greater diversity of species is also created by the cultivation of mixed crops and usually also in combination with woody plants (agroforestry) in permaculture. This diversity of plants and structures is attractive to a wide variety of animal groups. The absence of pesticides is also beneficial for biodiversity.According to the researchers, higher carbon stocks in the soil of permaculture areas can be explained on the one hand by a higher input of carbon-containing organic matter and on the other hand by the effect of mulching. This is because permaculture areas are fertilized almost exclusively with manure or compost; reduced tillage and a layer of mulch prevent the top layer of soil from being eroded by heavy rainfall, for example. This means that the loss of carbon from the soil is lower in permaculture areas than in conventional cultivation.The observed improvements could represent a real turnaroundThe research team draws a promising overall conclusion: \\\"Permaculture appears to be a much more ecologically sustainable alternative to industrial agriculture\\\", Julius Reiff is certain. At the same time, the yields from permaculture are comparable to those of industrial agriculture, as the researchers' not yet published data shows. \\\"In view of the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, the observed improvements would represent a real turnaround when applied to larger areas\\\", emphasizes ecosystem analysis expert Martin Entling from RPTU. The phosphorus content that the team found in permaculture soils also gives cause for hope: \\\"I hadn't expected such high amounts of phosphorus. Plants need phosphorus from the soil in order to grow. In intensive agriculture, phosphorus is abundantly applied and becoming a scarce commodity and a major challenge for agriculture worldwide. Another add-on for permaculture\\\", attests geoecologist Hermann Jungkunst from the RPTU. Soil expert Johann Zaller from BOKU admits: \\\"I would not have expected permaculture to promote earthworms and other soil organisms to this extent. Given the importance of soil life for mitigating climate extremes and for the health and yield of crops, the results are very promising.\\\"Permaculture as a role model? Politics and the education system are challengedIn order for permaculture to be introduced into agricultural practice on a larger scale, the researchers recommend that financial incentives such as taxes and subsidies should be restructured in such a way that sustainable farming methods are given preference over conventional methods. The education system for farmers also needs to be revised so that more sustainable approaches such as permaculture, agroecology and pesticide-free regenerative agriculture are taught. Furthermore, flagship projects could serve as living case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of these sustainable farming methods.The researchers conclude that permaculture seems to make it possible to reconcile agriculture, environmental protection and nature conservation. This is a very hopeful finding in view of the dramatic environmental impact of conventional agriculture.Reference: Reiff J, Jungkunst HF, Mauser KM, et al.
