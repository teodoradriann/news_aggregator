    "text": "‘Hello From The Hills’ Benefit Concert To Return To City Winery Nashville\nThe “Hello From The Hills” benefit concert, co-presented by The Hello in There Foundation and Hope in the Hills, will return to City Winery Nashville for its second annual event on Sunday, Jan. 28.\nThe Hello in There Foundation was founded by the family of John Prine in 2021 and aims to identify and collaborate with individuals and communities to offer support for people who are marginalized, discriminated against or, for any reason, are otherwise forgotten. Hope in the Hills is a nonprofit organization committed to combatting the opioid crisis and support recovery across Appalachia that was created by a group of local community members and members of music star Tyler Childers‘ team.\nThe event will feature acoustic performances from Childers, Wynonna Judd, Ben Folds, S.G. Goodman, Abby Hamilton, Gabe Lee, Lindsay Lou and Jeremy Short, among others, and will once again be hosted by NPR Mountain Stage’s Kathy Mattea.\n“We’re honored to team up with our good friends at The Hello In There Foundation to start out this new year by spreading joy, empathy and healing during our gathering to share music, light and love,” says Dave Lavender, Board President, Hope in the Hills. “We know soon enough 2024 will take its lumps with some people talking about a world of ‘us and them,’ of dividing and conquering, of building more walls and fences to keep out neighbors. We humbly approach this event, this year and this work, walking in compassion and empathy knowing as John Prine once wrote, ‘Broken hearts and dirty windows/Make life difficult to see.’ It is in that seeing and hearing spirit, we come together to honor some amazing nonprofits doing the good and hard work of helping folks in need, and in their doing, teach us all how to daily water and nurture the tree of hope and forgiveness.”\n“We’re thrilled to partner once again with Hope in the Hills for an incredible concert in support of nonprofits who are doing thoughtful, necessary work for people in need. These organizations truly embody the spirit of community care that John Prine shared with the world throughout his life,” adds Celine Thackston, Executive Director, The Hello in There Foundation.\nThe Hello in There Foundation and Hope in the Hills have selected three organizations to receive grants this year: MusiCares, which provides health and welfare services to the music community; Tennessee Justice for Our Neighbors, an organization that provides compassionate immigration legal services to those seeking humanitarian relief; and Musicians Recovery Network, which supports those struggling with addiction through the power of music, arts and spirituality.\nTickets will be available for presale starting this Wednesday (Jan. 10), with general sales following on Friday (Jan. 12).

    "title": "Winston Peters skewers Russia in UN speech, blames both Hamas, Israel for ‘misery’",
    "text": "Foreign Affairs Minister [Winston Peters](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/winston-peters/) has used his [United Nations](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/united-nations/) address to warn that the “abuse of the veto” power by some of the world’s superpowers has “serious implications” for all countries. Despite that, Peters said New Zealand’s support for the UN remained “unwavering” and announced the country’s intention to campaign for a seat on the Security Council, though not until the 2039-40 term. He also said more diplomacy and political leadership was needed across the globe as the world faced its worst challenges since World War II. He mentioned the “catastrophic and ruinous path” [followed in Gaza](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/gaza/), putting blame for the “misery” on both Hamas and Israel. The speech to the UN General Assembly capped off a busy week for the deputy Prime Minister, who met [with a number of world leaders on the sidelines of the annual event ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/winston-peters-meets-palestinian-authority-pm-ahead-of-major-un-speeches/BHLLTDGFOJHAJCTBPMMDNPCPEY/)and[ spoke yesterday to the Security Council](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/winston-peters-stops-united-nations-speech-calls-for-room-to-be-quiet/YU2TF5EF2VET7AVZBYCBXT3CA4/). The council and its five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – were the focus of much of Peters’ speech on Friday. While speaking about the “abuse” of the veto power, Peters made explicit reference to Russia. He said the superpower had “acted in utter contempt” of the UN Charter when it “illegally invaded” Ukraine and then vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning its actions and calling for an immediate withdrawal. “Not only does Russia lack the sincerity and moral determination required to make the United Nations work, but its delinquency should be a clarion call for long overdue Security Council reform,” Peters said. Earlier this week, Peters announced more sanctions against Russia for its continued aggression against Ukraine. Since March 2022, more than 1700 individuals and entities have been sanctioned under the Russia Sanctions Act. Winston Peters speaks at the UN General Assembly. Peters invoked Peter Fraser, the New Zealand Prime Minister during most of World War II, in speaking about how New Zealand has “fought against the veto powers bestowed upon the Great Powers” since the formation of the UN Charter. “Fraser warned that ‘the veto which can be exercised by one of the Great Powers both in regard to itself and other nations is unfair and indefensible and may, if retained and exercised, be destructive not only of the main purposes of the international organisation, but of the institution itself’.” Peters said the spirit in which the UN Charter was devised in the immediate aftermath of World War II was “sagging under the weight of its own potted history”. “Power waxes and wanes so yesterday’s ‘Great Powers’, today’s Permanent Members of the Security Council, are challenged by periods of competition or worse, abuse of the veto. “This has serious implications for all states and the conduct of our foreign affairs. While some Permanent Members exercise restraint in their use of the veto, others consistently and frequently abuse this power.” The Foreign Affairs Minister said reform was needed so the Security Council “looks more like today’s world”, where he said there were escalating tensions between a rules-based international order that protects small states and the “unjustified exercise of power by certain Great Powers”. “Yet small states matter now as much as they did then. New Zealand holds the foundational belief that all states are equal and that our voices matter as much as the more powerful states represented here. It is the quality of our arguments and the principles of justice that inform them, not the size of our militaries, that should hold sway here.” He said small states want to see the world’s superpowers “talk more, seek better understanding between them, and develop ways of compromising more”. “Rather than a zero-sum game, effecting better relations between today’s “Great Powers” only enhances global stability, and that is what we smaller nations seek.” Peters spoke of the “stark” challenges the world faces – including armed conflict, climate change and a crisis of trust in institutions – “the worst the world has faced since World War II”. “Growing distrust and division is making international cooperation more difficult, placing the United Nations under strain, and hindering the organisation’s ability to find effective solutions.” He said this required diplomacy and “political leadership”. An example of that Peters gave was former US President Jimmy Carter’s work with Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1978 to develop the Middle East Peace Accords. “Contrast that leadership with the catastrophic and ruinous path that has been followed in Gaza. This misery was caused by both Hamas’ monstrous terrorist attacks last year and the now overwhelming nature of Israel’s response. “We are most concerned about the generational consequences of this level of suffering and violence, with no end in sight and which sees us on the precipice of an even wider conflict.” Peters said New Zealand never again wanted to “experience the catastrophe of another World War”. “We must reject and resist those who seek to conquer and control. We must always seek the path of peace because the lasting victories of humanity are those of peace, not war. “Finally, despite our frustration at the lack of political will required to adapt this organisation to fully meet the challenges of today, New Zealand’s support for the United Nations remains unwavering. That commitment is unchanged from when Prime Minister Fraser expressed his great hopes for the Charter eight decades ago. “We believe effective multilateral diplomacy means taking responsibility for our obligations as member states. So, to that end, we announce today New Zealand’s intention, as a voice for small states, to campaign for a seat on the Security Council for the 2039-40 term.” New Zealand previously served a two-year term on the council between January 2015 and December 2016 after a decade-long campaign.

    "text": "Army chief identifies problems\nSaluschnyj: We have to prepare for reduced military aid\nFebruary 2, 2024, 12:13 a.m\nWhile the Ukrainian media speculates that Saluzhnyj will soon be deposed, the army chief publishes a comment about the defensive war against Russia. The top general also names some of the challenges that Kiev has to overcome in his opinion.\nAmid speculation about his impending dismissal, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valeriy Zalushnyj addressed massive supply problems in an opinion article. “We must contend with reduced military support from critical allies who are grappling with their own political tensions,” the general wrote in a statement\nWebsite of the US television channel CNN published essay. The partners’ stocks of rockets, missiles for anti-aircraft systems and artillery ammunition were coming to an end due to the intense fighting in Ukraine. There is also a global shortage of propellant charges.\nAccording to him, Russia has advantages in mobilizing soldiers. Without unpopular measures, Ukraine’s state institutions would not be able to compensate for this disadvantage. The government’s second bill on stricter mobilization measures is currently being discussed in the Ukrainian parliament. Due to legal restrictions and partial monopolization, there are also production bottlenecks, including ammunition, in the company’s own defense industry. “This deepens Ukraine’s dependence on supplies from its allies,” Saluzhny emphasized.\n“Our combat experience is unique”\nHe called for a new state system of technological upgrading to be created within the next five months. This is primarily about remote-controlled systems such as drones to reduce your own losses. It is crucial not to get involved in a trench warfare in which Ukraine has no advantage. The training of soldiers must also be adapted to new opportunities and existing restrictions.\n“Our combat experience, especially since 2022, is unique,” said Salushnyj. “But in the interest of victory, we must constantly find new ways and new capabilities that will help us gain an advantage over the enemy.”\nThe general did not address the rumors that have been circulating in Ukrainian and international media since Monday about differences of opinion with President Volodymyr Zelensky and his possible dismissal. There were also no assessments of developments along the 1,000-kilometer-long front line. Ukraine has been fending off a Russian invasion for almost two years with massive Western arms and financial aid. Saluzhnyj is credited with significant contributions to the successful defense of the capital Kiev and the reconquest of areas in eastern and southern Ukraine.",

    "title": "Limassol delivery drivers to protest ‘non-stop violence’ (video)",
    "text": "Scores of delivery drivers are set to protest in Limassol’s city centre on Friday, amid increasing attacks against them and allegations of police inaction.\nThe protest will begin at 11:30 at the old port and move towards molos.\nThis is the second time this week they will protest, as “the violence is still continuing and we need help,” Rajesh, a delivery driver working in Limassol told the Cyprus Mail.\nHe said it has become routine for delivery drivers to be ambushed by groups who steal the drivers’ money, phone, and sometimes their bike, under threat of a knife.\nAfter that “we get beaten up every time.”\nLeft helpless and stranded, Rajesh described dismissive attitudes from police officers when they try to report the incident.\n“We need support from locals.”\nWhen he himself went to report an attack, he said he was simply told “my friend just be careful. Don’t work in a dangerous area.”\nBeyond that not being enough, Rajesh stressed there is no longer a safe area in Limassol. Attacks often take place in the city centre uninterrupted.\nA video shared with the Cyprus Mail shows a delivery driver in Limassol abandoning his bike in the street as he is flanked and chased by a group of people on motorbikes who then drive off.\nWhile in the past the main issues were observed in Ypsonas and Ayia Fyla, it has now become common for robberies to unfold in spots such as Makariou and the city centre, according to Rajesh.\nEarlier this week Limassol police spokesperson Lefteris Kyriacou\nacknowledged the severity of the situation.\n“In the past month, we have received more complaints than usual from delivery drivers,” he said. “However, I want to make it clear that every time we receive such complaints and reports, we act immediately. They are unfortunately many, and we are doing our best to identify all perpetrators.”\nKyriacou also added that several arrests have been made in connection with the attacks on delivery drivers.\nThe issue however is far from new. Almost one year ago, delivery drivers spoke to the Cyprus Mail and pleaded “\nplease write about this.”\n“We are afraid. We are afraid to do our jobs. People wait for us in the dark and hit us, throw stones at us, they steal our money and bikes.”\nAt the time, the increasing violence had been connected to the\nracist violence which unfolded in Chlorakas and Limassol, targeting primarily Syrian nationals.\nAmnesty International had taken a stance on the matter, saying it was “responding to pogrom-like demonstrations and violent attacks against racialised people, including migrants and refugees, in Limassol and Chlorakas in recent weeks.”\nThe NGO’s migration researcher Adriana Tidona highlighted “the violent, racist attacks in Chlorakas and Limassol must serve as a wake-up call for authorities in Cyprus to take immediate measures to tackle racist rhetoric and abuse, which have been on the rise in the country for years.”\nLabour Minister Yiannis Panayiotou said at the time Cyprus’ economy\nwould collapse without migrants.\nThe latest US Department of State report on human rights published in April this year documented concerns related to racism in Cyprus including\nan increase in violent attacks against migrants.",

Police located servers in France and Iceland and arrested Ghost's alleged administrator, a 32-year-old Australian man identified as Jay Je Yoon Jung.\nGhost, founded nearly 10 years ago, gained popularity among criminals for its advanced security. It deployed three encryption standards, allowed users to auto-delete old messages and wipe their devices remotely.\nJung was a resident of a quiet Sydney suburb; Australian media [reported](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-18/socially-awkward-ghost-app-founder-loved-karaoke/104365002) that he lives with his parents. He [allegedly](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/afp-operation-kraken-charges-alleged-head-global-organised-crime-app) sold modified smartphones embedded with Ghost for $2,350 each, offering a six-month subscription and tech support along with each sale. The devices cannot make calls, send SMSs or access the Internet. Jung faces five criminal counts, including supporting a criminal organization and identity fraud.\nAbout 700 Australian law enforcement officers rounded up 38 people across four states on Tuesday. Authorities [told](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-18/socially-awkward-ghost-app-founder-loved-karaoke/104365002) public broadcaster ABC that police infiltrated Ghost after obtaining a handset. \"It was really some very smart software engineering and modification of updates to those devices to essentially turn them into surveillance devices,\" an Australia Federal Police official said.\nEuropol and Eurojust coordinated the takedown among nine governments, including police from Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. Users of Ghost also included organized crime figures in the Middle East and South Korea. Australian police were able to prevent the death or serious injury of as many as 50 individuals, David McLean, assistant commissioner of the Australian Federal Agency, [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdlIT0zmmyY) during the Brussels press conference. Irish police arrested 11, confiscated drugs worth 16 million euros and seized 350,000 euros in cash along with cryptocurrency and more than 150 electronic devices, said Justin Kelly, assistant commissioner of the Irish National Police.\n\"Criminals thought they would and could hide behind technology to coordinate drugs and weapons traffic, extreme violence and money laundering across borders,\" said Europol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle. \"No matter how advanced the technology, no matter how secure they think their communications are, we will find them.\"\nThe takedown is one of a series of international law enforcement operations targeting encrypted communication networks. French and Dutch police in 2020 [penetrated](/european-police-hack-encrypted-communication-system-a-14553) encrypted messaging service EncroChat, an operation that authorities last year said led to the arrests of 6,558 individuals worldwide and the recovery by police of 900 million euros in criminal funds (see: [EncroChat Disruption Leads to Arrest of Over 6,000 Suspects](/encrochat-disruption-leads-to-arrest-over-6000-suspects-a-22387)).\nBelgian and Dutch police in 2021 targeted Sky ECC, another now-defunct encrypted messaging service (see: [Police Target Criminal Users of Sky ECC Cryptophone Service](/police-target-criminal-users-sky-ecc-cryptophone-service-a-16162)).\nGhost did not have the same number of users as those two chat networks, Europol Deputy Executive Director Jean-Philippe Lecouffe said during the press conference. The disruption of those other services fragmented the criminal market for encrypted chat, he said. \"Sometimes the smaller networks get the most bottom criminals and the most interesting information,\" he added. Lecouffe also made the by-now standard plea from law enforcement for tech providers not to offer unbreakable end-to-end encryption, calling access to communications among criminals \"the lifeblood of our operations.\"\nCybersecurity advocates have pushed back against attempts by governments to create a weakness in end-to-end encrypted messaging, arguing that hackers would ultimately discover and exploit the flaw. The European Court of Human Rights earlier this year [ruled](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/?i=001-230854) that end-to-end encryption is essential to preserving the right to privacy in digital communication systems, and privacy advocates have argued that lawful access mechanisms to messages would be a conduit to mass surveillance. Tech companies have generally resisted police calls for no end-to-end encryption, citing a need to retain user trust in online messaging.\nFrench authorities in late August arrested and charged Telegram CEO Pavel Durov for complicity with hacking, child sexual abuse material and refusal to cooperate with law enforcement authorities (see: [Indictment of Telegram CEO Threatens End-to-End Encryption](/indictment-telegram-ceo-threatens-end-to-end-encryption-a-26175)).\nUpdated Sept. 18, 2024 20:13 UTC: This story has been updated with additional detail throughout.\nWith reporting from Information Security Media Group's Jayant Chakravarti in Pune, India and David Perera in Washington, D.C.",

    "text": "Madrid: Atletico Madrid took revenge for last week’s semifinal defeat in the Spanish Supercup, reaching the Copa del Rey quarterfinals with a 4-2 home win over Real Madrid.\nJust as in Saudi Arabia last week, the two teams produced another 120 monumental minutes of football, but this time goals in extra-time from Antoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme tilted the balance to Atletico’s way in front of a packed Metropolitano Stadium on Thursday, reports Xinhua.\nAlso Read Atletico Madrid beats Real Madrid 3-1 in Spanish league Champions League: Bayern face Manchester United; Atletico Madrid take on Lazio on Matchday 1 The first half was sandwiched by two completely different actions from Atletico keeper Jan Oblak, who in the 20th minute made a brilliant double save to deny Rodrygo and then Vinicius Jr as his teammates asked for offside.\nBefore that double save, Jude Bellingham was unlucky as Jose Gimenez did just enough to deflect his shot onto the crossbar.\nReal Madrid were looking more fluid and taking the game to their neighbors, who were leaving too much space between lines.\nRodrygo saw a free kick deflected over after a foul on Jude Bellingham and Fede Valverde hit a powerful shot at Oblak, before Atletico opened the scoring in the 38th minute.\nRodrigo de Paul found room to cross and his ball took a deflection off Antonio Rudiger for Lino to score at the far post.\nThings got heated and Vinicius, who was again been the target of racist insults from a section of the Atletico fans, was booked for complaining a refereeing decision, before a rare Oblak error gifted Real Madrid an equalizer in first half injury time.\nLuka Modric swung in a diagonal free kick and the keeper came a long way off his line, but his punch sent the ball into his own net.\nTen minutes into the second half, it was Andriy Lunin’s turn to look bad as he could only palm a deflection off Eduardo Camavinga into the path of Alvaro Morata, although Rudiger should have done a better job of protecting him.\nRodrygo then saw a shot blocked onto the post by Lino, before Lunin made two vital blocks, first to deny Griezmann from a narrow angle and then Morata, who looked certain to score from Marcos Llorente’s cross following an Atletico counter-attack.\nLunin’s second save was vital as Real Madrid equalized in their next attack, with Vinicius passing to Bellingham, who crossed for Joselu to score a simple header minutes after getting into the game.\nIn the extra time, Griezmann restored Atletico’s lead in the 100th minute with a brilliant individual goal, taking advantage of a poor control from Vinicius to run down the right touchline, before cutting inside and firing into the roof of the net from a tight angle.\nThe second period of extra time saw two tired teams giving everything. Dani Ceballos had the ball in the net but it was ruled out for a Bellingham offside.\nWith Real Madrid searching for an equalizer, Atletico caught them on the break and Riquelme assured their place in the last-eight after finishing off a move started by Griezmann and with Memphis Depay giving the final pass.",

    "text": "Five thousand miles have passed since Torque News began testing\nUniroyal’s Tiger Paw all-season tires. In that time, we’ve had the tires to the shore, the mountains, onto many muddy construction sites, and have traveled over quite a bit of snow and ice. Principal tester Emma Risken reports that the Tiger Paw tires have been outstanding thus far. If you have not read our initial test report on the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires, please check it out right here.\n“I haven’t had a single issue with the Tiger Paw tires,” reports Ms. Risken. “They are quiet, smooth, provide great traction, and drive smoothly.” Assistant tire tester, Ozzy the chocolate lab, also likes the tires, but only sniffed our hand when asked for more details.\nOur test vehicle is one of New England’s most popular five-passenger crossover SUVs. It features symmetrical all-wheel drive, so starting off in slippery conditions is never an issue. However, all-wheel drive doesn’t help much when turning on snow, and it does nothing to help you stop on ice. Those conditions require a tire you can trust. Not every all-season tire is really cut out to be a tire one can use on deep snow. However, the Uniroyal Tiger Paw has proven to be very capable in winter conditions. Even more important, they have handled this season’s historical cold snap with aplomb.\nOur test vehicle’s fuel economy remains unchanged from its prior tires, which were worn and had lived a full life. We routinely beat the vehicle’s Combined EPA rating. That’s a good indication that the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires have not reduced this vehicle’s fuel economy.\nWe feel this tire is an excellent match for those who wish to have one set of affordable tires for year-round use. If we were planning a lot of off-road or a lot of deep snow commuting, we might pick a different Michelin or Uniroyal model, but they would likely be more expensive. The Tiger Paw tires were among the most affordable in our price comparison but have certainly matched the expectations of our test team in winter and even over muddy access roads.\nPlease check back in late winter for an update on our long-term test of the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires.\nUniroyal Tiger Paw Tire Fast Facts:\nSize Tested: 225/55-17\nSpeed Rating - V\nUniform Tire Quality Grade (UTQG): 600 A A\nTire Type - All-Season Touring\nTreadwear Warranty: 65,000 miles\nTread Depth as measured by test driver Emma Risken ~7.39 mm\nExample Price - $138.97 each (Walmart)\nMiles covered in testing thus far = 5,000\nImage Notes: Torque News tire tester Emma Risken contributed the images used in this story.\nReview Note: Uniroyal has provided the tires for this test at no cost. However, the Torque News team paid full price out of pocket for mounting and balancing.\nJohn Goreham is a credentialed New England Motor Press Association member and expert vehicle tester.

    "text": "Se deja liberada la restricción para el \"código de descuento\", en el que las mutuales tenían una ventaja monopólica.\nLa Ley Ómnibus presentada esta semana en el Congreso Nacional por el Ejecutivo presenta un significativo cambio en el ámbito financiero, con el otorgamiento de préstamos y créditos.\nUno de los puntos destacados del proyecto es la apertura del llamado \"código de descuento\", una práctica que hasta ahora estaba reservada a las mutuales y que representaría una oportunidad para las empresas dedicadas a los préstamos en línea.\nEstas compañías fintech podrían encontrar una vía para otorgar créditos contra la posibilidad de debitar las cuotas directamente del salario del deudor, reduciendo así las tasas de interés que actualmente se aplican en los préstamos personales.\nDe esta manera, la Ley Ómnibus deja liberada la restricción para el \"código de descuento\", en el que las mutuales tenían una ventaja monopólica, devolviéndole al individuo la libertad de establecer restricciones crediticias con quien quiera.\nADEMÁS: Los plazos fijos UVA tendrán una duración mínima de 180 días\nEn el proyecto se dispone específicamente que “cualquier empleado podrá solicitar la retención del importe de cuotas sociales, cargos por servicios, pago de intereses, o cualquier otra obligación de pago regular, a favor de la mutual de su elección, así como de personas humanas o jurídicas, cualquiera sea su naturaleza\".\nY agrega: \"Los importes retenidos serán ingresados a los beneficiarios dentro de los cinco días de haberse abonado los haberes. Igual procedimiento regirá para los jubilados y pensionados nacionales\".\nLa medida también afectaría la competencia en el sector bancario, ya que las entidades financieras se verían obligadas a enfrentar la entrada de numerosas entidades que podrían ingresar al negocio de préstamos.\nLa propuesta muestra también un desafío para los trabajadores informales que no cuentan con un salario sujeto a descuentos.\nSin embargo, la apertura del mercado crediticio podría incentivar la creación de soluciones financieras específicas para este grupo, buscando superar la barrera de la falta de historial crediticio y la informalidad laboral.\nSe verían favorecidas con esta medida las fintech especializadas en los préstamos on line. Uno de los principales problemas que tienen estas compañías es que solo pueden recurrir al cobro voluntario del cliente a la hora de otorgar un préstamo. Por otra parte se trata de préstamos a sola firma, sin mayores garantías.\nHace tres años el Banco Central les prohibió a las fintech el cobro de la cuota por el sistema denominado “barrido automático”, que consiste en cobrarse la cuota mensual debitando directamente del CBU.\nEsto provocó que muchas empresas directamente quedaran fuera de juego ante el aumento exponencial del riesgo que tuvieron que asumir. Para este segmento solo quedaba habilitada la posibilidad del pago voluntario.\nAparecen en esta nota: Ley Ómnibus Fintech",

    "text": "Gaining recognition in the Tamil movie industry demands bravery to take risks and commitment to hard work. The journey to achieving stardom in films remains a distant goal for many individuals. However, actor Sathyaraj stands out as someone who accomplished the seemingly impossible and earned a name for himself.\nThe actor-producer, who is now widely recognized, began his journey in the Tamil cinema industry with humble beginnings and faced numerous challenges. Despite the initial hardships, his film career flourished, leading him to achieve great success in subsequent years. Notably, he portrayed the iconic character of Kattappa in SS Rajamouli&apos;s Baahubali film series, alongside Prabhas.\nSathyaraj and beginnings in Tamil cinema\nSathyaraj was born in Coimbatore in the year 1954. The son of a doctor Subbiah, he completed his education in the city itself but was always a fan of cinema, especially actors MGR and Rajesh Khanna.\nDespite facing opposition from his mother, Sathyaraj ventured into the world of cinema by relocating to Kodambakkam, Chennai. He initially approached actor Sivakumar and producer Thiruppur Manian for work, later joining a drama troupe.\nHis first acting opportunity came in the film Sattam En Kaiyil alongside Kamal Haasan, where he portrayed a henchman. By 1985, he had appeared in 75 films, often in antagonist roles.\nIn 1985, he was featured in a lead role in the film Saavi, which became a massive success at the box office.\nThe famous Kattappa of Indian cinema\nActor Sathyaraj has been a part of the Indian film society for many years now. The actor over the past years has predominantly acted in Tamil cinema while also making appearances in other languages like Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi.\nThough many loved and revered him for his iconic comedy and villainous antagonist roles, the actor catapulted to glory with the portrayal of Kattappa in the films Baahubali and Baahubali 2. Every single person in India during the period of films being made had one question in mind and wanted to know, why he killed Baahubali.\nDespite the passage of time since the answer was revealed, the character and the actor who portrayed him continue to leave a lasting impression on audiences. With a single role, the immensely skilled actor rose to fame as one of the most iconic figures in Indian cinema. Just like Prabhas and Rana Daggubati are associated with the movie, Kattappa remains etched in people&apos;s memories!\nBUZZ: Shruti Haasan and Sathyaraj to likely join Rajinikanth-Lokesh Kanagaraj&apos;s Thalaivar 171\nMeet Tamil actor who ran away from his home and became a sensation with just one role; not Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan",
