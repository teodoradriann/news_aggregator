    "text": "The 7 Division of the Nigerian Army in Maiduguri, has confirmed the arrest of a soldier for allegedly killing a truck driver at a checkpoint along Maiduguri – Dikwa- Gamboru road.\nAccording to PUNCH, the incident occurred following a misunderstanding between the soldier and the driver at the checkpoint.\nIt was gathered that the incident which occurred on Boxing Day, led to a boycott of the busy border road in protest by commercial drivers, leaving many travellers stranded.\nConfirming the arrest on Thursday in a statement, the 7 Division Public Relations Officer, Lt. Col. A.Y. Jingina, said that the Army had commenced an investigation after receiving a complaint from the National Union of Road Transport Workers.\nThe statement read: “Furthermore, engagement has been established with NURTW towards a peaceful resolution of the incident.\nREAD MORE:\nDSS, Army Arrest ISWAP Leader\n“The division has assured both the family of the deceased and the NURTW of its commitment to ensure that justice is served to the family and no stone would be left unturned in this regard.\n“In the division’s effort towards ensuring that the family of the victim gets justice, the soldier in question has been arrested, and an investigation has commenced.\n“It’s also worth mentioning that the division does not tolerate any form of unprofessional conduct from any personnel as we operate within the ambit of the law.\n“The division wishes to reassure the members of the general public once again that we will remain resolute and professional in the joint effort to tackle insecurity in Borno State.”",

    "title": "Disinformation campaign spurred student attack on Rohingya shelter, Indonesian activists say — BenarNews",
    "text": "Disinformation campaign spurred student attack on Rohingya shelter, Indonesian activists say 2023.12.28 Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and Jakarta Human rights activists and some observers on Thursday alleged that university students who stormed a Rohingya shelter in Aceh province the day before had been influenced by an “organized” disinformation campaign, which some even linked to the upcoming general election. Their comments came amid a flood of condemnation of the [“inhumane” incident](https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/indonesia-crowd-storms-rohingya-shelter-12272023135901.html), which resulted in the students forcing the 137 terrified refugees in Banda Aceh, mostly women and children, into trucks to another location. The Rohingya will now be guarded by security forces, a top minister said Thursday. Observers noted that the mob action on Wednesday – which was captured on video and widely circulated – was not typical of student protests in Aceh. Hendra Saputra, the project coordinator of Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Indonesia, an NGO in Aceh, said he suspected that Wednesday’s incident was not spontaneous, but “organized and systematic.” He told BenarNews that the students were influenced by social media posts that spread hate and misinformation about the Rohingya. “[The posts] also accused the refugees of taking their food and land, and of sexual harassment and other bad behavior. But these are all false accusations,” he said, adding that no evidence was presented to substantiate the claims. Besides, the refugees couldn’t be a burden because the government is not spending money on them, Hendra said. “There’s no government budget allocated for refugee management,” he said. Aceh, a predominantly Muslim province that has special autonomy status in Indonesia, has a history of welcoming the Rohingya refugees, who are also Muslim. However, as more than 1,500 Rohingya have arrived since mid-November, the province’s villagers have been demanding they be sent back, claiming there weren’t enough resources for the refugees as well. Those demands grew to small protests, which on Wednesday escalated to the student mob [charging into the Rohingya shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTfSgaz_GUM), kicking their belongings and creating mayhem, as many of the refugees sobbed uncontrollably or looked on, frightened and shocked. The government will move the 137 Rohingya refugees to the local Indonesian Red Cross headquarters and the Aceh Foundation building, said Mohammad Mahfud MD, the coordinating minister for political, legal, and security affairs. “I have instructed security forces to protect the refugees because this is a humanitarian issue,” Mahfud told journalists in Sidoarjo, East Java. Some analysts have attributed the hostility towards the Rohingya to deliberate misinformation. Chairul Fahmi, a Rohingya researcher and law lecturer at Ar-Raniry State Islamic University in Banda Aceh, said some of this disinformation could be linked to political actors who have an interest in exploiting the refugee issue for their own agenda. “The authorities might have had a hand in the Rohingya disinformation campaign. The protest yesterday did not reflect the typical student movement,” he told BenarNews. “There is a possibility that the students were instructed.” Political parties or groups could try to stir up anti-Rohingya sentiment ahead of the general election in February, suggested Ahmad Humam Hamid, a sociologist at Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh. “Aceh should not be used as a battleground for the presidential election over the Rohingya matter. It would be very dangerous,” Ahmad told BenarNews. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, the frontrunner in the Feb. 14 presidential election, was in Aceh on Thursday, and spoke about the Rohingya. He said that while Indonesia should be humanitarian towards the stateless Rohingya, it should also prioritize the welfare of its own people. “Many of our people are struggling, and it is unfair to take in all the refugees as our responsibility, even if we feel humanitarian and sympathetic,” Prabowo said, according to local media. Della Masnida, 20, a student at Abulyatama University who took part in Wednesday’s incident at the shelter, accused Rohingya refugees of making “unreasonable demands.” “They came here uninvited, but they act like this is their country. We don’t think that’s fair,” she told reporters on Wednesday.The student mob collectively issued a statement saying they rejected the Rohingya “because they have disrupted society.” “We all know that President Joko Widodo has stated that there is a strong suspicion of criminal acts of trafficking among them. Even the Aceh police have said that this is an international crime,” they said in the statement issued Wednesday. The Rohingya are a persecuted Muslim minority from Myanmar, who have been fleeing violence and oppression in their homeland for years. Close to one million live in crowded camps in Bangladesh. With few options after years of a stateless existence, many Rohingya are desperate to leave and that makes them susceptible to exploitation by [human traffickers](https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/bengali/traffickers-lure-rohingya-with-jobs-08282023105648.html), analysts have said. Gateway to Malaysia Most of the Rohingya who arrived in Aceh recently had left violent and crowded refugee camps in Myanmar’s neighbor, Bangladesh, where 740,000 of them took shelter after a brutal crackdown by the Burmese military in 2017. For the Rohingya, Indonesia is a gateway to Malaysia, which is a top destination for migrant workers from many South Asian and Southeast Asian nations. The Indonesian government, which has not ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention, has said that it does not have the obligation or the capacity to accommodate the Rohingya refugees permanently, and that its priority is to resettle them in a third country. Earlier this month, [government officials complained](https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/smuggling-claim-12152023142047.html) they were overwhelmed and Indonesia was alone in bearing the burden of the Rohingya. Mitra Salima Suryono, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR in Indonesia, believes nothing could be further from the truth, and cited some numbers to illustrate her point. “There are about 2,000 Rohingya refugees in Indonesia, compared to 105,000 in Malaysia, 22,000 in India, and nearly 1 million in Bangladesh,” she said.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in LaMoure County, North Dakota from 1901-2000 was 13.4. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did LaMoure County, North Dakota experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in LaMoure County, North Dakota history.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "Tories ‘writing off’ young people as growing number ‘economically inactive’ The Tories are “writing off” young people, Labour has said, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term sickness” doubling since 2010. Sir Keir Starmer’s party said that in 2010/11, there were 116,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work or not looking for employment due to long-term sickness. The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for the whole of the UK now puts this number at 235,000 people out of work, the party said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: “By neglecting the foundations needed for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.” The Labour MP said her party would ensure young people do not fall between the cracks between services and Government departments. It hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers’ rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity. Ms Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis facing so many of our young people. “We will transform mental health services, drive down NHS waiting lists, boost skills, bolster employment rights and provide tailored job support.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both sought to get people of all ages back into the workplace, in a bid to boost labour supply across the UK. The proportion of people out of work rose since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, but the issue is also seen to be caused by a broader set of factors including rising disability and long-term sickness levels. A Government spokesperson said: “We are driving down inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of youth unemployment falling by 43% since 2010. “We are investing £2.3 billion into mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to participate in education and apprenticeships. “More widely our Back to Work Plan will help up to 1.1 million people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or long-term unemployed to look for and stay in work.” A Conservative spokesman accused Labour of having a “brass neck”, saying the party had “never left office with unemployment lower than what they inherited”.",

    "text": "The recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, on the interpretation of harassment under the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, marks a significant milestone and a positive stride in the realm of workplace rights. In its historic judgement, the Court adopted a purposive approach, acknowledging the Act’s broader intent and aligning it with international obligations, thus amplifying the scope of protection for victims of workplace harassment.\nPreviously, the Act defined harassment solely within a narrow scope of unwelcome sexual advances or conduct. However, the recent judgment recognised the Act’s broader intent, acknowledging the devastating impact of non-sexual demeaning attitudes or behaviour on victims. This nuanced understanding reflects the necessity of addressing diverse forms of harassment, crucial for ensuring a safe and respectful work environment.\nMoreover, the Court’s emphasis on considering the victim’s perspective and applying the standard of a reasonable woman is pivotal. By adopting the viewpoint of a reasonable woman, the judgment acknowledges that discriminatory behaviour, even if not overtly sexual, could still constitute harassment. This standard broadens the lens through which harassment claims are evaluated, acknowledging that certain behaviours, while not explicitly sexual, could be distressing or discriminatory, aligning with international norms and standards.\nThe significance of this ruling also lies in its alignment with international obligations, such as the Convention Against the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. The Court’s scrutiny of parliamentary debates and the Act’s initial intent emphasised the obligation to eliminate all forms of discrimination at work. The judgment rightly recognised that workplace rights transcend sexual harassment, incorporating protection against gender-based discrimination as well.\nMoving forward, the implications of this ruling are profound. It not only rectifies the narrow interpretation of harassment but also ensures legal protection for victims who faced gender-based discrimination from 2010 to 2022. By broadening the understanding of harassment to encompass various forms of gender-based discrimination, this judgment stands as a beacon of progress, affirming the rights and dignity of all employees.",
