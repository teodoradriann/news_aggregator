    "text": "The head of Ukraine’s eastern-rite Catholic church on Saturday said a document endorsed by [Pope Francis this week permitting blessings for same-sex couples](https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/vatican-approves-blessings-for-same-sex-couples-in-landmark-ruling/) did not apply to his church and its teachings. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said the [Vatican document](https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/vatican-approves-blessings-for-same-sex-couples-in-landmark-ruling/) “interprets the pastoral meaning of blessings in the Latin Church” but made no reference to issues governing the eastern, or Greek Catholic, church. “Thus … this Declaration applies solely to the Latin Church and has no legal force for the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,” Shevchuk said in a statement. He said a blessing could not be separated from the church’s teachings and “can in no way contradict the teaching of the Catholic Church about the family as a faithful, indissoluble, and fertile union of love between a man and a woman.” The eastern-rite church worships according to rites similar to the Orthodox faith but is in communion with Rome by virtue of a 16th century agreement. Repression forced the church underground in Soviet times and it now has about 4.5 million parishioners, or roughly 10% of the population of Ukraine. The document from the Vatican’s doctrinal office said Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies. It said such blessings would be a sign that God welcomes all but should not be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage. Gay rights are making some progress in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states outside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed sympathy for upholding gay rights, though ruling out constitutional changes to allow single-sex marriages while the country is at war.",

    "text": "[by Derek Major](https://www.blackenterprise.com/author/majord/) December 28, 2023 Memphis Grizzlies Guard JA Morant Responds To Criticism For Celebration In Win Over New Orleans Pelicans He was literally dancing. :-/ Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant responded to the heavy scrutiny he faced following a celebration after a big dunk during Tuesday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans. Sports Illustrated [reported ](https://www.si.com/nba/2023/12/27/grizzlies-ja-morant-celebration-criticism-responds-reaction-rock-ya-hips?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=news_tab&fs=e&s=cl)after the win, Morant celebrated by dancing toward the crowd. However, many people on social media believed he was miming shooting fake guns. The celebration comes just four games after Morant served a 25-game suspension stemming from the Grizzlies guard showing guns on Instagram Live twice. Morant responded to the criticisms on the X app, formerly known as Twitter, indicating that he was dancing and not firing weapons. The Grizzlies struggled without Morant during his 25-game suspension, starting the season 6-19. However, since Morant’s return, the Grizzlies have won four straight games, and the point guard has led the team in points for two of the wins and assists in all four. The Murray State [product](https://www.blackenterprise.com/tag/ja-morant/) was named the Western Conference [player of the week](https://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/grizzlies-ja-morant-named-nba-western-conference-player-of-the-week-122623) following his return. Morant has averaged 28.8 points, 8.5 assists, and 5.3 rebounds while shooting 50.6% from the field in the four games he’s played in. Morant, named the 2019-20 Rookie of the Year, has enjoyed a fantastic start to his career. The two-time All-Star won the 2021-22 Most Improved Player award and was named to the All-NBA second team. However, the All-Star guard was suspended in June after he was seen on Instagram Live flashing a gun. It was the second time he was caught on social media with a firearm in his hand. The 23-year-old was first suspended for eight games in March after he was shown with a gun on an Instagram Live video at a Denver nightclub. The Grizzlies are currently 10-19 and in 13th place in the Western Conference. As bad as their start was, they’re just five games out of a playoff spot with more than a month to go before the regular season’s halfway point. The Grizzlies start a two-game road trip Thursday against the Denver Nuggets and the L.A. Clippers before heading home to host the Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs.",

    "text": "First-Time Emmy Winners Judith Light and Jasmine Guy on Being Embraced by TV Academy: ‘This Is Quite a Gift’\nAs of Saturday night, Judith Light and Jasmine Guy were finally able to add “Emmy winner” to their list of career achievements. The pair picked up trophies on the first night of the two-part Creative Arts Emmy Awards, held at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\nAfter decades as working actors, the emotional moment of hearing their names called as winner was significant.\n“This one is about the fact that this Academy has acknowledged me in this way, which is huge,” said Light, who earned four previous nominations. She won guest actress in a comedy series for her turn opposite Natasha Lyonne on Peacock’s “Poker Face.” “I’ve been in the business a long time. This is quite a gift to be nominated with all of these other women in this category who I still admire, and who I think are not only incredible artists but extraordinary human beings.”\nGuy appeared on the NBC hit comedy “A Different World” from 1987 to 1993 and counts “Harlem Nights” and “Fame” among her credits. In contrast to Light, Guy took home an Emmy on her first nomination. Guy said she felt “embraced” by the TV Academy in winning for Guy took home the prize for outstanding actress in a short-form comedy or drama series for “Chronicles Of Jessica Wu.”\n“I appreciate that my creative community has kept me in their loving arms,” Guy said as she admired her new hardware.\nDuring her acceptance speech, Light called the last year “challenging,” referring to the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes, which delayed the Emmy Awards festivities beyond the usual September timing. “To all of you for your perseverance, your artistry, your substance and your resilience, it was an honor to be in the industry with you all,” Light said.\nBackstage, Light had the opportunity to elaborate further on the strength of the industry. She said, “We are a resilient industry. We are people of purpose. We are also people of service, and so much of what happened last year was about supporting other people.” Light continued, “It’s super important to be focused on various points and all of the things that actually were gained because it was challenging, and it was challenging for everybody.”\nLight also emphasized that despite the glitz and glamour that surrounds Hollywood, actors are workers who need to support one another to do their best work.\n“We often forget that we are a service business. We give a performance, we give to each other on a set,” she said. “We are about the people who watch us. It is about the giving. If you’re in this industry to try to get a new thing, you’re in a really bad contextual framework. I look at our industry and I see how resilient everybody was. I see how they persevered, how they were kind to each other. I wanted to speak to that because it makes me proud to be in this community and in this industry.”\nMore from Variety\nFor more stories like this, follow us on MSN by clicking the button at the top of this page.",
