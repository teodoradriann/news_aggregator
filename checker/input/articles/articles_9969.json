    "title": "Great Aussie toad bust takes aim at deadly invader",
    "text": "It reads like a B-grade movie script: hundreds of deadly predators maniacally hurling themselves at the doors of suburban homes.\nAlarmed residents shelter inside, knowing their streets and backyards have been overrun and they’re now outnumbered.\nThat was reality for some Gold Coast residents just before Christmas when thousands upon thousands of young cane toads invaded the beachside suburbs of Tugun and Currumbin.\nFootage of the occupation went viral on social media, inspiring a collective outpouring of fear and loathing for the relentless tide of toxic toadlets.\nBut toad busters say people living in Australia’s cane toad zones don’t have to take the deluge lying down, and there’s plenty they can do to fight back.\nJanuary 13 marks the start of the Great Cane Toad Bust – a week-long national event that encourages people to head outside to collect and humanely euthanise toads, toadlets and tadpoles.\nAfter epic rainfall in many parts of Australia, breeding conditions have been perfect and organisers say it should be a bumper bust.\nThe event is organised by environment group Watergum, and invasive species officer Nikki Tomsett says it really is a case of every toad counts.\n“A single female cane toad can produce up to 70,000 tadpoles a year,” she said.\nGiven cane toads can live for up to 15 years, that’s over a million potential offspring for every female out there.\nPrevious busts have seen more than 50,000 cane toads removed in a single week.\nBut the event is also about encouraging people to go toad busting year-round to help native species, which have suffered terribly since toads were imported and released in a failed bid to control beetles in sugar cane crops.\nThe warty invader failed to fix the beetle problem. And the 2400 toads that were released in Queensland’s far north quickly bred and spread.\nThe cane toad is now an ecological disaster in Queensland, NSW, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, where they compete with native frogs for food and habitat and kill wildlife that dares to eat them.\nThey’re toxic at every stage of their life-cycle. They can kill domestic dogs in just 15 minutes and even eat honey bees.\nBeekeepers have shared horror stories of finding toads working together to form ladders to reach elevated hives, before taking it in turns to wait at the entrance and gulp down bees as they emerge.\nAt Boonah, about 100km inland from the Gold Coast, a fearless team of trappers called Women Against Cane Toads is gearing up for this year’s bust.\nThey know they’ve got their work cut out for them, given the stories that are swirling about toadlet invasions on par with what happened on the Gold Coast.\nLinda Kimber is the fearless leader of the group, which she formed a few years back in a bid to get over her phobia of toads and frogs.\n“Every time I saw a cane toad, I’d call out to my husband – ‘Stephen, Stephen there’s a toad!’,” she said.\n“And I thought ‘this is ridiculous’, and we wanted to get more women involved in the Great Cane Toad Bust. So we started this group of mature women to help overcome their fears of handling cane toads.”\nThese days they’re experts, with their own individual styles.\nLinda favours the grab-em-by-the-back-legs approach, and likes to pop them in a two-wheeled shopping trolley so she doesn’t have to lug them around.\nOthers go for the belly grip, or the pin-em-down-then-pick-em-up method, and like to use draw-string bags.\nWhatever the approach, it’s always a low-tech affair and the basics are gloves, a torch and a way to contain the warty jumpers.\nToads can then be dropped off at collection points, where they’ll be humanely subdued in the fridge before being transferred to the freezer to die painlessly.\nThe carcasses are worth their weight in gold for Watergum, which harvests their toxin glands and uses them to make lures for their highly effective tadpole traps.\nThe bucket-like traps – designed for use in ponds, dams, creeks and even puddles – harness the cannibalistic tendencies of cane toad tadpoles.\nWhen tadpoles hatch, they instinctively seek out and eat eggs laid by other females. They do this by searching for a whiff of a pheromone that’s present in cane toad toxin and the secretion that surrounds the eggs.\nIt’s a sure-fire way to attract masses of cane toad tadpoles, with no risk to other species that don’t respond to the pheromone.\n“You can easily catch a couple of hundred but some people have caught thousands in one go – the traps are just a soup of tadpoles,” Ms Tomsett said.\nBack in Boonah, Linda says the achievements of Women Against Cane Toads hasn’t gone unnoticed by the blokes.\n“It’s a bit of a challenge for some of the blokes – you know, ‘if the women can do it, well we can do it too’,” she laughed.",

    "text": "Aguibou Camara fires Guinea to narrow victory over Gambia to boost top-two bid\nGuinea were able to claim revenge after Gambia had knocked them out of the 2021 edition in the last-16 stage.\nAguibou Camara’s second-half goal fired Guinea to a precious 1-0 victory over Gambia in Group C of the Africa Cup of Nations.\nBoth nations had failed to claim all three points in their tournament openers and were aware of the significance on this fixture towards their knockout stage hopes.\nAfter a goalless first half in Yamoussoukro, Camera made the breakthrough with 21 minutes left when he slid home from Morgan Guilavogui’s cross and it proved enough to move Guinea up to four points ahead of their final group game with current leaders Senegal.\nGambia boss Tom Saintfiet shuffled his pack with five changes made from their opening loss to Senegal, but chances were few and far between early on.\nGuinea almost took the lead in the 33rd minute, but Mohamed Bayo’s right-footed strike hit the post and it remained 0-0 at half-time.\nKaba Diawara’s Guinea continued to press for the opener and forced a number of corners before the deadlock was finally broken after 69 minutes.\nGuilavogui was the architect for the goal after he collected Ibrahim Diakite’s pass and cut back for Camara to poke home after he beat Gambia defender James Gomez to the centre.\nIt sparked jubilant scenes from the Guinea team and it was almost 2-0 moments later, but Bayo struck the crossbar from close range.\nEx-Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita was introduced late on and he helped Guinea hold on for a potentially vital victory to claim a semblance of revenge after Gambia knocked them out of the 2021 edition in the last-16 stage.",

Even now, it is intended to ensure that a third of the Elbe water flows into a 21-kilometre-long canal. © Simon Kremer/dpa\nEven today, the flood situation in parts of Germany is likely to remain tense. A key question is how much rain falls.\nDresden/Hanover - The situation in the flood areas remains threatening. The German Weather Service (DWD) predicted some heavy rainfall. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain is to be expected from Friday morning until Saturday night. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours. The situation in Lower Saxony is tense. In eastern Germany, too, many fire brigades are still in continuous operation.\nIn Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. The situation there worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of relief workers are deployed across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments during the night as a precaution. In the morning, the state government wants to give an update on the flood situation at a press conference.\nBecause: \"Experts have been warning for a long time\" Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, counties can more easily access auxiliary staff.\nThe city of Verden an der Aller is also affected by the floods. © Jörn Hüneke/XOYO Film/dpa\nThere is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times.\nNo all-clear yet on the Elbe On the Elbe in Dresden, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured. This was still just below the six-metre mark from which the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded in the morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. A normal water level of 2.00 meters in the Elbe in the state capital is normal.\nThe hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from today, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, and neither precipitation nor snowmelt in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe is expected to date.\nDownstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.\nMy news Because he was bored: Family man wins over 6 million euros – with a bet of 1.60 €read more\nDream of eternal youth: Multimillionaire undergoes controversial treatment – \"I am now genetically enhanced\"read\nPolar vortex event imminent: Climate phenomenon expected to cause the onset of winter soonread\nDrama shakes Italy: ambulance collides with bus full of children - 4 dead\n30 centimetres of fresh snow and snow line sinking – winter comeback is imminent\nRemedies for colds: get rid of colds and sore throats quicklyread\nThe flood from the German-Polish border river Oder has already partially flooded meadows in front of the dike. © Patrick Pleul/dpa\nIn the north of Thuringia, the focus is on the Kelbra dam, from which water has been drained. In the village of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth, there was therefore a threat that about 30 houses would be flooded, as a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior announced on Thursday. Emergency services had set up 6000,<> sandbags on the riverbank to prevent this. According to the information, the water was about ten centimeters below the edge of the bank.

    "text": "AFP News Bangladesh opens mosque for transgender hijra community Read full article Shafiqul ALAM 29 March 2024 at 10:01 am · 4-min read Bangladesh's transgender hijra community have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice (REHMAN ASAD)\nKicked out of other prayer services, members of Bangladesh's transgender hijra community have been welcomed at a new mosque in the Muslim-majority nation with the promise of worship without discrimination.\nThe humble structure -- a single-room shed with walls and a roof clad in tin -- is a new community hub for the minority, who have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice.\n\"From now on, no one can deny a hijra from praying in our mosque,\" community leader Joyita Tonu said in a speech to the packed congregation.\n\"No one can mock us,\" added the visibly emotional 28-year-old, a white scarf covering her hair.\nThe mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka on the banks of the Brahmaputra river, was built on land donated by the government after the city's hijra community were expelled from an established congregation.\n\"I never dreamt I could pray at a mosque again in my lifetime,\" said Sonia, 42, who as a child loved to recite the Koran and studied at an Islamic seminary.\nBut when she came out as hijra, as transgender women in South Asia are commonly known, she was blocked from praying in a mosque.\n\"People would tell us: 'Why are you hijra people here at the mosques? You should pray at home. Don't come to the mosques,'\" Sonia, who uses only one name, told AFP.\n\"It was shameful for us, so we didn't go,\" she added. \"Now, this is our mosque. Now, no one can say no.\"\n- 'Like any other people' -\nHijra have been the beneficiaries of growing legal recognition in Bangladesh, which since 2013 has officially allowed members of the community to identify as a third gender.\nSeveral have entered Bangladeshi politics, with one transgender woman elected mayor of a rural town in 2021.\nBut hijra still struggle for basic recognition and acceptance, lacking property and marriage rights.\nThey are also often discriminated against in employment and are much more likely to be victims of violent crime and poverty than the average Bangladeshi.\nStory continues Hardline Islamist groups have also lashed out at the recognition of transgender Bangladeshis in school textbooks, leading rallies to demand the government abandon its push to include them in the curriculum.\nMufti Abdur Rahman Azad, founder of a hijra charity, told AFP that the new mosque was the first of its kind in the country.\nA similar endeavour planned in another city was stopped last month after a protest by locals, he added.\nDozens of local hijra women donated time and money to build the Dakshin Char Kalibari Masjid for the Third Gender, which opened this month.\nIt also has a graveyard, after a local Muslim cemetery last year refused to bury a young hijra woman inside its grounds.\nThe mosque's imam, Abdul Motaleb, 65, said that the persecution of the hijra community was against the teachings of his faith.\n\"They are like any other people created by Allah\", the cleric told AFP.\n- 'No one can be denied' -\n\"We all are human beings. Maybe some are men, some are women, but all are human. Allah revealed the Holy Koran for all, so everyone has the right to pray, no one can be denied.\"\nMotaleb said that other Bangladeshis could learn from the faith and strength of the hijra.\n\"Since I have been here at this mosque, I have been impressed by their character and deeds,\" he said.\nThe new mosque is already tackling prejudice. Local resident Tofazzal Hossain, 53, has offered Friday prayers there for a second week in a row.\nHe said living and praying with the hijra community has changed his \"misconceptions\" about them.\n\"When they started to live with us, many people said many things,\" he told AFP.\n\"But we've realised what people say isn't right. They live righteously like other Muslims\".\nTonu hopes to expand the simple mosque to be big enough to cater for more people.\n\"God willing, we will do it very soon,\" she told AFP.\n\"Hundreds of people can offer prayers together.\"\nmma-sa/pjm/gle/mca\nTRENDING Actress Julie Tan on love, troubles with dating, and what she's looking for in a guy: 'I'm waiting for my Travis' Yahoo Lifestyle Singapore · 4-min read Man who got into debt from visits to 'diao hua' clubs forged mother's signature to sell her Rolls Royce and Mini Cooper Yahoo News Singapore · 4-min read Three companies in Singapore fined for food safety breaches; one tampered with expiry date markings on pre-packed food Yahoo News Singapore · 3-min read Malaysia arrests 5 people connected to job scam syndicate targeting Singaporeans; linked to at least 40 reports, over $820k in losses Yahoo News Singapore · 3-min read Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, appointed as Returning Officer for Singapore's elections Yahoo News Singapore · 1-min read",

Grace United Urban Ministries in the Historic Capitol Hill District sustained major water damage after a fire started in the space above the ministry. Just after 6 p.m., flames began shooting out of the building along Southwest 25th Street, shattering windows and causing a puddle of problems. “We got a lot of water damage that came through the second floor,\" said Donna Heins, the pastor of Grace United Urban Ministries. \"We help the homeless get back on their feet. We do case management and feed them a meal.\" The ministry moved into the building just six months ago, but it has served those experiencing homelessness for almost 20 years. Donna and her husband, Marco, have dedicated their lives to helping those in need. \"When it’s a calling, it’s just a part of you. I can’t get rid of it,\" said Donna. Now, the ministry needs a new home, too. \"The ceiling as of last night was still intact, but through the night, it has fallen,\" said Donna. \"We’re going to have to relocate because it is too much damage, and OG&E and the fire marshal said they’re not going to turn on the electricity to the building.\" On Thursday, volunteers worked to salvage what they can. \"This is where we have dinner. The guys have been taking out the tables,\" said Donna. Oklahoma City firefighters located a space heater near the origin, but they said the cause is still undetermined. [Get the latest news stories of interest by clicking here.](https://www.koco.com/) \"It’s really so surreal. I really can’t process everything,\" said Marco. Marco's father owns the building. He found out on Thursday that it wasn't insured. \"We’re just really in a time of need,\" said Marco. Caught underneath drooping ceilings and ankle-deep in troubles, the ministry said their big concern is how to keep serving. “We literally have to learn how to walk on water to keep going,\" said Donna. \"If you have a building for lease or something you could help us with, we really want to stay in this area.\" Top Headlines [Attorney: Glynn Simmons, who wrongfully spent nearly 50 years in prison for murder, diagnosed with cancer](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-glynn-simmons-diagnosed-with-cancer/46229863) [37-year-old New Year's Eve tradition in Oklahoma City will not continue](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-city-new-years-eve-opening-night/46230744) [FORECAST: Snow possible in parts of Oklahoma with lingering cold temperatures](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-weather-forecast-snow-cold-thursday/46241492) [Mega Millions winner claims record $1.6 billion prize after buying ticket in Florida](https://www.koco.com/article/mega-millions-florida-winner-claim/46237550) [Oklahoma restaurant booming after viral social media post](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-norman-spirals-hot-dog/46229717)",

    "title": "Stryper Frontman Michael Sweet Warns That Judgmental Christians ‘Turn People Away From God’",
    "text": "When Christian metal band Stryper rose to fame in the 1980s, the group was somewhat polarizing among Christians.\nWhile frontman Michael Sweet and his drummer brother Robert Sweet came to faith after watching TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart, Swaggart later\nreferred to Stryper and all Christian rock music as “blasphemy” and “the voice of the dragon.”\nToday, Michael Sweet still believes that the church has work to do in overcoming its judgmental posture toward the world.\n“People use the Scriptures about judging and how we’re called to judge people,” Sweet told\nCrosswalk Headlines. “And I think they misinterpret that and twist it into their own Scripture. And we’ve got to be really cautious of that.”\nRELATED:\n‘We’re Definitely Living in the End Times,’ Says Stryper Frontman Michael Sweet\n“What that means is we’re supposed to hold each other accountable, but you’re not supposed to go out with a hateful heart and in a godless spirit and judge people because all that does is turn people away from God,” he added.\nSweet fears that such an attitude among Christians is “turning other people away from God. I feel that the church does that far too often.”\nWith the advent of social media, Sweet said he routinely sees judgmental comments from Christians directed at him or other artists that he admires.\n“We live in a ‘me’ world. It’s all about self-gratification. Everyone’s giving their opinion,” he said. “We all fall prey to that. But it doesn’t make it right. And we need to all be very careful of that.”\nSweet and Stryper have always taken a different approach.\nRELATED:\n‘To Hell With the Devil’—For KING & COUNTRY Team Up With Lecrae and Stryper\n“We have unbelievers come to the show; we have believers come to the show,” Sweet said. “Our goal was always to go into the mainstream world and perform. You know—go into the bars, go into the clubs, arenas with bands like White Lion. We were never a church band. That just wasn’t our calling.”",

    "text": "Today is a special day, and not just for fans of math and/or pi(e). It’s the birthday of someone who has, quite literally, changed the lives of all of us who watch this silly sport. Yes, it’s Steph Curry’s 36th birthday. Happy birthday, Steph. Celebrating Him today— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) [pic.twitter.com/8awC5cndKe] [March 14, 2024] It’s customary to give gifts to those celebrating their birthday, but to pay homage to the man who changed (ruined?) the game, I’m going to change (ruin?) the game of birthdays. Instead of giving Curry a gift, I’m going to suggest that he give us one. Come back, Steph. Please. Pretty please. You owe us a birthday present. Or something. Curry’s return does appear to be around the corner, with the Dubs optimistic that he’ll return for their next game, which is Saturday against the [Los Angeles Lakers](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com). That’s good, because the Warriors have been fairly helpless in his absence: since he sprained his ankle with four minutes remaining against the Chicago Bulls, the Warriors managed to fall apart in that contest, lose at home to a putrid (and Victor Wembanyama-less) [San Antonio Spurs](https://www.poundingtherock.com) squad, beat the Spurs, and lose to the [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com). It hasn’t been pretty, and the run they seemed poised to go on has fallen by the wayside ... though coach [Steve Kerr remains optimistic](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2024/3/14/24100832/dub-hub-steve-kerr-has-no-doubt-the-warriors-can-make-a-big-run-to-finish-the-season-nba). But while we all want Curry to return, I suppose we can put our selfish desires aside and simply celebrate the man. Steph acting goofy on his 36th birthday— Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) [ via [@ayeshacurry]IG] [pic.twitter.com/ms5aNGhMnL] [March 14, 2024] Birthdays are always worth celebrating, but in the case of Curry it’s also a time to marvel at not just what he’s done, but how he’s sustained it through an age where NBA players were long assumed to be limping towards the finish line. Curry is averaging 26.9 points per game ... if he can hold that mark, it will be just the fifth time in NBA history that a player has averaged 26 points per game in their age-35 or older season, joining LeBron James (twice), Kevin Durant (also this year), and Alex English. He spent a decade-plus setting a new bar for what jump shooters can do on the court ... and now he — along with James and Durant — is helping to set the bar for what NBA players can do deep into their 30s. It’s nothing short of remarkable. So happy birthday, Steph. Enjoy the heck out of it. And then seriously, please come back, we need you.",
