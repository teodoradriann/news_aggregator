    "title": "Alacaraz tumbles in US Open second round shocker to end 15-match unbeaten run at slams",
    "text": "Anyone can contribute to The Roar and have their work featured alongside some of Australia’s most prominent sports journalists. Carlos Alcaraz’s 15-match grand slam unbeaten run has ended at the US Open with a sloppy 6-1 7-5 6-4 loss to 74th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round. Alcaraz won the French Open in June and Wimbledon in July to raise his career total to four major championships, including taking the title at Flushing Meadows in 2022, and was the pre-tournament favourite to leave with the trophy again. But he never found his footing against van de Zandschulp, a 28-year-old from the Netherlands. Alcaraz was way off, repeatedly missing the sorts of shots he usually makes routinely. After double-faulting to fall behind two sets to none – a deficit he’s never overcome – the No.3-seeded Alcaraz slung his equipment bag over this shoulder and trudged toward the locker room. The upset win presents Australia’s top men’s player Alex de Minaur with a huge opportunity to continue his career-best season and reach a maiden grand slam semi-final. Originally on a collision course with Alcaraz in the quarter-finals, the Spaniard’s fall now means the tenth seed will play no one higher-ranked than him until at least the last four, with 25th seed Jack Draper the highest-ranked foe left in his quarter. Fellow Aussie Jordan Thompson, who stunned seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz in straight sets in his second-round match, could also benefit, though he will first need to get past 30th seed Matteo Arnaldi in the third round before a potential battle with de Minaur in the fourth round. Earlier, top seed Jannik Sinner beat American Alex Michelsen 6-4 6-0 6-2 to reach the third round of the US Open and set up a clash with Australian Chris O’Connell. Sinner converted eight of his 16 break-point chances en route to dispatching Michelsen in 99 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium for his ATP Tour-leading 30th hard-court win of 2024. “I feel like I can improve still a couple of things,” said the 23-year-old Sinner, who now faces world No.87 O’Connell. “But you have to be obviously very happy to be in the next round and so I’m just trying to get better as a player.” In the early goings Michelsen proved up for the challenge as he twice came back from a break down in the first set, but after Sinner broke a third time for a 5-4 lead he closed out the frame on serve. Sinner found another gear in the second set and had a much easier time as he raced out to a 3-0 double-break lead to seize control and never looked back as Michelsen’s serve suddenly abandoned him and his unforced errors started to pile up as he won two of the last 14 games. The victory was in contrast compared to their first meeting two weeks ago during the second round in Cincinnati where Sinner prevailed in two close sets en route to lifting the title. “Very happy to be through against a very tough opponent,” Sinner said on court after his win. “We played each other in Cincinnati… so I knew a little bit what to expect. I think also he knew a little bit what to expect.” Former champion Daniil Medvedev was far from his best but still did enough to dispatch Fabian Marozsan 6-3 6-2 7-6 (7-5) to reach the third round. Medvedev won an opening set that included six breaks of serve across nine games, with the Hungarian’s serve failing to pack a punch and the Russian’s uncharacteristically tentative serving leading to four double faults. Medvedev was far more comfortable from there, helped by his opponent’s 45 unforced errors and catalogue of poorly timed drop shots. Medvedev sealed victory with a leaping backhand on match point and afterwards appeared annoyed with the muted reaction from the stands at Flushing Meadows, where he has had a rocky relationship with the crowds over the years. Despite making the Australian Open and Indian Wells finals this year, fifth seed Medvedev was not among the favourites coming into the US Open after first-round exits at tune-up events in Canada and Cincinnati. Medvedev, who was broken four times in the match, faces Italian 31st seed Flavio Cobolli, who beat Zizou Bergs 4-6 6-3 7-5 6-3, in the third round on Saturday. Unseeded Czech Tomas Machac defeated American Sebastian Korda 6-4 6-2 6-4, much to the locals’ dismay. Korda, the 16th seed, struggled through an elbow injury during the match. No.24 seed Arthur Fils was also upset, going down 7-5 6-7 6-4 6-4 to Canadian Gabriel Diallo. Other second-round winners included No.25 seed Jack Draper, No.30 seed Matteo Arnaldi, Dan Evans and David Goffin.",

    "title": "DERECHOS LABORALES | ¿Es legal que la empresa me añada a un grupo de WhatsApp? Todo sobre la normativa de protección de datos",
    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente En la actualidad, muchos trabajadores se encuentran atrapados en un círculo sin fin de notificaciones y mensajes en sus móviles personales a través de grupos de WhatsApp del trabajo. Esta práctica ha generado una discusión sobre sus implicaciones legales y los derechos de los empleados en relación a la desconexión digital.\nWhatsapp ya te permite saber si tu mensaje ha sido leído por una persona distinta al destinatario original\n¿Es legal que te incluyan en un grupo de WhatsApp del trabajo sin tu consentimiento? Si tu móvil es personal, la respuesta es clara: no pueden obligarte a estar en un grupo de WhatsApp laboral sin tu consentimiento . Así lo establece la normativa de protección de datos y la legislación sobre los derechos digitales en España. La Ley Orgánica 3/2018, de 5 de diciembre, de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales, indica que la empresa debe contar con el consentimiento explícito del trabajador para incluirlo en cualquier grupo de WhatsApp relacionado con la actividad laboral. Esta ley protege la privacidad del trabajador, especialmente cuando se utiliza su número personal para fines profesionales.\nSegún los informes de la Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD), la inclusión en un grupo corporativo sin el consentimiento del trabajador puede considerarse una infracción. Es recomendable que las empresas obtengan este permiso por escrito y que acuerden las normas de uso de la plataforma.\nAsí funciona el nuevo canal de Whatsapp en Catalunya para evitar estafas\n¿Y si el móvil es de la empresa? En el caso de que el móvil en cuestión sea proporcionado por la empresa para llevar a cabo las tareas laborales, la situación cambia . En este caso, la empresa puede incluir al trabajador en el grupo de WhatsApp sin necesidad de su consentimiento directo. Esto se debe a que la inclusión en grupos de trabajo es una extensión de la \"potestad de dirección y organización\" de la empresa, que tiene derecho a imponer herramientas de comunicación para facilitar la operatividad del trabajo.\nSin embargo, hay reglas claras que la empresa debe cumplir. Según la AEPD, la empresa debe justificar la necesidad de utilizar WhatsApp para la organización laboral, y debe cumplir con los siguientes puntos:\nLa empresa cubre todos los costes asociados al móvil . Debe existir un acuerdo claro sobre el uso del grupo de WhatsApp , especificando el tipo de comunicación que se llevará a cabo y las normas para su participación. Los trabajadores no están obligados a responder mensajes fuera del horario laboral . El derecho a la desconexión digital está protegido por la ley y debe ser respetado.\nGrupos de Whatsapp de empresa: ¿es legal? / 123RF\nLos trabajadores con este grado de discapacidad podrán jubilarse hasta 10 años antes\nEl derecho a la desconexión digital En España, el derecho a la desconexión digital es un derecho consolidado y respaldado por varias leyes. El artículo 20. Bis del Estatuto de los Trabajadores y el artículo 88 de la Ley Orgánica 3/2018 garantizan que los trabajadores no están obligados a responder a comunicaciones laborales fuera de su jornada laboral, incluyendo mensajes de grupos de WhatsApp.\nEste derecho a la desconexión se refuerza aún más con la reciente legislación sobre teletrabajo. Según la Ley 10/2021 sobre Trabajo a Distancia, las empresas deben implementar políticas que respeten el derecho de los trabajadores a desconectar digitalmente, tanto fuera de su horario laboral como durante los fines de semana y vacaciones.\nSemana Santa 2025: ¿Cuánto me tienen que pagar si trabajo en festivo?\n¿Qué hacer si tu jefe no respeta este derecho? Si la empresa o el jefe no respetan este derecho y te obligan a responder mensajes fuera de tu horario laboral, puedes denunciarlo ante la Inspección de Trabajo y Seguridad Social . La ley establece que la intrusión de la vida personal del trabajador es una infracción grave que puede acarrear sanciones para la empresa.\nAdemás, si los trabajadores se ven obligados a estar disponibles fuera del horario laboral, pueden negociar un plus de disponibilidad , que sea remunerado por la empresa, ya que el derecho a la desconexión es irrenunciable.",

    "title": "RTL resurrects Jesus in Kassel - Breaking Latest News",
    "text": "Kassel – The Son of God donates Pizza Frutti di Mare and Kassel is considered the “new Jerusalem”: RTL has once again retold the story of Jesus Christ in an extraordinary way with its second Bible musical “The Passion”. The show, which interweaves the suffering of the Savior with German pop songs, was staged in Kassel in the evening and broadcast live on television. Unfortunately the sky was not kind to the actors and spectators – it was raining in northern Hesse.\nJesus was played by singer and presenter Ben Blümel (42), actor Jimi Blue Ochsenknecht (32) took on the role of the traitor Judas. Singer Nadja Benaissa (41) from the pop band No Angels sang her way through several songs as Mother Mary, while actor Francis Fulton-Smith (57) portrayed a diabolical Roman governor Pontius Pilate with a tie and pocket square. “Good Times, Bad Times” actor Timur Ülker appeared as Peter – the disciple on whom Jesus wants to “build his church”.\nHannes Jaenicke leads through the Bible\nHowever, actor Hannes Jaenicke (64) had the biggest speaking role, as the narrator led through the biblical material and steadfastly defied the rain (“I’m not made of sugar”). The actor is also known as a committed environmentalist – and has highlighted the suffering of rhinos and orangutans throughout his career. That evening he tried to explain why Jesus’ suffering could still be relevant. “Our story today is not a fairy tale. “It really happened one way or another,” said Jaenicke. And it has the potential to “bring people together again”.\nRTL staged “The Passion” for the first time in 2022, back then in Essen. The viewership was impressive. The idiosyncratic mix of a decidedly modern interpretation of the Jesus story, a little theology and all sorts of RTL celebrities in supporting roles was fascinating and provided plenty of topics for discussion. The format has been running in the Netherlands for several years.\nLast Supper: Ciabatta and pizza\nSo now the second German performance, in which the ancient material was illustrated with images from a German city in the here and now. Jesus, for example, arrived in Kassel rock solid on the Deutsche Bahn – “on time,” as Jaenicke emphasized, which led to the biggest laugh of the evening in the audience. Meanwhile, some disciples roared up on e-scooters. For the Last Supper, the Savior then ordered Italian food – five ciabatta breads and two pizzas. Topping: Frutti di Mare. As a silent witness, ex-football manager Reiner Calmund followed the order of the Savior in a guest role, as he did in 2022. Reality TV veteran Jenny Elvers played a blind woman who was given back her sight by Jesus. Long robes, dust and sandals like those in Bible films were looked for in vain.\nSome people were still quite surprised. “I’m a bit irritated,” said viewer Mareike from Kassel. She didn’t realize that the production was so modern. Apart from the weather, she liked it. 8,000 people were able to watch the show on the main stage at the central Friedrichsplatz.\n“Kassel should be our new Jerusalem”\nNarrator Jaenicke portrayed Kassel – a city in the middle of Germany that is rarely featured in the media with a rough charm in some places – as an almost perfect location for the Bible drama. The “population center” of the Federal Republic is very close, he said. “So if we were all going to have a big meeting, Kassel would be the place for it.” Unfortunately, there is currently a long way to go in the country for a family reunion.\n“Society is drifting apart at an alarming rate. Racism, sexism, anti-Semitism and the climate crisis threaten our society,” said Jaenicke. And he added the iconic sentences: “Our population center today is RTL. And Kassel should be our new Jerusalem.” When looking at the television images showing many people in rain ponchos, it was sometimes difficult to follow this mental journey to Jerusalem.\nGod saves marriage after infidelity\nParallel to the Jesus story on stage, a procession with a heavy, glowing cross moved through the city. RTL presenter Angela Finger-Erben (“The atmosphere here is really breathtaking”) interviewed people there about their stories with God. Sometimes astonishing things were heard. For example, the story of a family that traveled from Flensburg to Kassel especially for the “Passion”. The husband, who was carrying the cross, told the TV audience about an affair that had once caused the marriage to break up. But she was saved with the help of God. “I prayed a lot,” said his wife. “He gave me courage to forgive.”\nAt the end, singer Ben Blümel stood on a multi-story shopping street in Kassel – beaming, in a white shirt and as a resurrected Jesus. Whether it was North Hesse or Jerusalem – the main thing was that Easter could come.",
