[BDSA](https://theartofmaryjanemedia.com/category/bdsa/) Which State Has The Cheapest Marijuana Who doesn’t love a good bargain? Or bragging right for a good deal….well here is the best deals on weed Everyone loves a good bargain! Be it real estate or eggs, most people look at prices and compare. A third of people claim they’re the best bargain hunter they know (34%). In addition, 87% say they’ll carry money-saving habits with them forever. In fact, the reason prices in at 99, . 95, or . 98 is a psychological pricing strategy to make products appear cheaper than they are. This is based on the theory that consumers are more likely to perceive an item priced at $4.99 as being significantly cheaper than an item priced at $5.00, even though the difference is only one cent. So which states have the cheapest marijuana and gas? One of the top bargain is the hunt for cheap gas…Costco is a winner. Gas prices are very complex and a global market. And there is always a profit motive. One study found gas prices fall twice as slowly as they rise after a major change in oil prices. This means, for example, if it took four weeks for gas prices per gallon to increase 25 cents, it would take them eight weeks to fall 25 cents once oil prices returned to their starting level. With this information, here is the top 5 places to fill you tank at the best price. RELATED: [California or New York, Which Has The Biggest Marijuana Mess](https://thefreshtoast.com/cannabis/california-or-new-york-which-has-the-biggest-marijuana-mess/) - Oklahoma. $2.59 - Arkansasa. $2.63 - Missouri $2.63 - Mississippi $2.66 - Wisconsin $2.67 When is comes to marijuana, it is a bit tricky. Legal New York City mainly sales via a black market. They have over 1,500 unlicensed dispensaries selling products at a premium. [BDSA](http://www.bdsa.com), one of the top data analysts shared information where consumers can purchase the cheapest legal weed. It Is not surprising market forces push up New Jersey and New York with all the weed available from the black market. And some states put a burdensome amount of taxes on products which always drives up the price. RELATED: [The Most Popular Marijuana Flavors](https://thefreshtoast.com/cannabis/the-most-popular-marijuana-flavors/) Here is the list! - New Jersey $17.9 - New York $15.5 - Missouri $13.5 - Maryland $13.3 - Illinois $12.7 - Florida $11.1 - Pennsylvania. $11.0 - California $10.4 - Massachusetts $9.8 - Ohio $9.7 - Nevada $9.2 - Oregon $7.1 - Colorado $7.0 - Arizona $6.9 - Michigan $5.4 Price doesn’t always mean the best – it means a bargain.

    "title": "Imam expulsé : qui ont été les derniers imams étrangers contraints de quitter la France ?",
    "text": "Accusé d’avoir proféré dans des prêches des appels à la haine visant les femmes, les juifs ou une société française « pourrie », l’imam tunisien de la mosquée de Bagnols-sur-Cèze (Gard), Mahjoub Mahjoubi, a été arrêté jeudi 22 février à son domicile et expulsé vers la Tunisie quelques heures plus tard. Plusieurs imams étrangers ont été expulsés du territoire français pour des propos qualifiés d’« incitation à la haine » ces dernières années.► Hassan Iquioussen, en janvier 2023En juillet 2022, le ministre de l’intérieur signe un arrêté d’expulsion contre Hassan Iquioussen, imam marocain de 58 ans à Denain (Nord), pour « un discours prosélyte émaillé de propos incitant à la haine et à la discrimination et porteur d’une vision de l’islam contraire aux valeurs de la République ». Les autorités lui reprochent d’« inciter à la haine » notamment envers les juifs, dans un discours en 2004 puis en 2014. Sa chaîne YouTube est alors suivie par 178 000 abonnés.À lire aussiExpulsion de l’imam Hassan Iquioussen : le gouvernement va-t-il trop loin ?Se défendant des accusations portées contre lui, le prédicateur fuit vers la Belgique à la fin du mois d’août, où il est arrêté un mois plus tard. Hassan Iquioussen, installé en France depuis sa naissance en 1964, est finalement expulsé vers le Maroc en janvier 2023.L’imam marocain dépose quelques mois plus tard une requête contre la France auprès de la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme, soutenant que son expulsion vers le Maroc lui fait encourir un risque de traitements inhumains et dégradants. La juridiction européenne rejette toutefois la requête en juin 2023, estimant que la demande d’expulsion émanait de la Belgique et non de la France. Un autre recours déposé par Hassan Iquioussen est pendant devant le tribunal administratif de Paris.► Mmadi Ahamada, en mai 2022En juillet 2021, Gérald Darmanin demande la suspension de l’imam de la mosquée de Saint-Chamond (Loire), Mmadi Ahamada, lui reprochant un prêche épinglé sur X (anciennement Twitter) par une conseillère municipale du Rassemblement national (RN). Il y promouvait un extrait de la sourate 33 du Coran : « Femmes musulmanes, tâchez d’obéir aux droits d’Allah et à ceux de vos époux, restez dans vos foyers. »Le ministre de l’intérieur demande dans la foulée à l’association qui gère cette mosquée d’instruire « le non-renouvellement du titre de séjour » de cet homme d’alors 34 ans, arrivé des Comores en 2013. La préfecture délivre également, sur demande du ministère, une obligation de quitter le territoire français (OQTF).Après un recours infructueux déposé auprès du tribunal administratif de Lyon, Mmadi Ahamada a finalement été expulsé en mai 2022 vers les Comores, avec son épouse et ses trois enfants, au terme d’un non-renouvellement de son titre de séjour. La juridiction avait toutefois rejeté le motif de « menace à l’ordre public » invoqué par la préfecture de la Loire et annulé l’interdiction de retour sur le territoire français d’une durée d’un an.► Doudi Abdelhadi, en avril 2018En avril 2018, Doudi Abdelhadi, imam de la mosquée As-Sounna, située en plein cœur de Marseille, reçoit un arrêté d’expulsion pour la teneur de ses prêches, jugés trop radicaux. Cette décision est toutefois suspendue par la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme (CEDH) qui demande un temps d’examen de la requête.Doudi Abdelhadi, d’origine algérienne, est placé en centre de rétention administrative en attendant la décision qui tombe deux jours plus tard. La CEDH donne son feu vert le 19 avril, estimant que les prêches de l’imam constituent des « actes de provocation explicite et délibérée à la discrimination, à la haine ou à la violence contre une personne déterminée ou un groupe de personnes ».À lire aussiÀ Marseille, un islam officiel fragmenté coexiste avec l’islam refuge des quartiers« Ils veulent en faire un exemple », estimait de son côté Vincent Geisser, sociologue spécialiste de l’islam, en 2018, interrogé par le New York Times à propos de la décision du gouvernement : « Cela relève davantage d’une stratégie de communication prônant la fermeté. »Plusieurs imams ont également été expulsés sous les quinquennats de Nicolas Sarkozy et de François Hollande, pour des propos discriminatoires ou d’incitation à la haine, à l’instar de l’imam tunisien Mohammed Hammami en 2012, ou encore une « dizaine » d’imams en 2015, comme l’avait annoncé le ministre de l’intérieur de l’époque, Bernard Cazeneuve.",
