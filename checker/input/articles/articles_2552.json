    "title": "Reba's Law 'resurrected' after expiring in legislative committee",
    "text": "CARSON CITY — Legislation that could land animal abusers in prison for as long as 10 years passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee this week after it appeared to die last week without a vote before the Legislature’s first deadline.\n“Amendments come and go and change at rapid speed as we approach the deadline,” the committee’s chairperson, Assembly member Brittany Miller said in Monday’s work session, indicating her internal polling of committee members last week, as amendments were crafted in the final hours, did not bode well for the measure. “At no time was there anyone who doesn’t want to address the heinous crimes and acts of animal cruelty.”\nMiller said lawmakers “don’t always have time to process” amendments, adding the committee was able to obtain a waiver allowing the Assembly Judiciary to vote Assembly Bill 381 out of committee. The bill, Reba’s Law, was “able to be resurrected,” Miller said, resulting in a “much more intense, robust bill than we had before.”\nThe measure is named for Reba, a bulldog who died of heat stroke days after she was found in a sealed tote behind a business last summer.\nAn amendment from the Nevada District Attorneys Association eliminated provisions that would have allowed for the prosecution of individuals who allow the abuse of an animal.\nThe amendment also removes language requiring permission from the animal’s owner or a veterinarian to euthanize an animal. It instead requires a peace officer to forfeit the animal to a local government if the owner does not request a hearing within a certain time frame, or cannot be found within five business days. The local government must then decide whether to euthanize the animal or transfer ownership to a rescue organization, shelter or individual.\nCausing the death of an animal would be deemed a category B felony, and could land offenders in prison for one to ten years and a fine of not more than $10,000.\nClark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson complained last year he needed stiffer penalties to impose against animal abusers than those allowed by law. However, a review of cases prosecuted by Wolfson indicates he rarely seeks prison time, even in egregious cases.\nLynn Whatford, a Clark County resident who cared for community cats in her neighborhood, spent much of the last year seeking justice for a colony of two dozen cats she says disappeared one by one. She suspects her neighbor killed them.\nNevada Voters for Animals founder Gina Greisen told lawmakers that Wolfson declined to prosecute the case after Whatford discovered a trapped cat left in her neighbor’s yard without protection from the sun and a high temperature of 114 degrees on July 25, the day the cat likely died. A veterinarian’s post mortem examination noted “it is clear (the cat) experienced extreme physical suffering in an inescapable situation, and that heat stroke is the likely cause of death in this case.”\nWhatford complained to Clark County Animal Control for months that the cats were disappearing and that she heard cries coming from her neighbor’s yard.\n“Animal Control told me I needed proof, yet the officer couldn’t access my neighbor’s property to get the proof. Animal Control referred me to Metro, but the detective wouldn’t do anything until I had proof,” Whatford said during an interview in September.\nGreisen testified in support of the measure, but warned that without proper training and resources for police and animal control officers, stricter penalties will do little to help stem abuse and neglect.\nLas Vegas justice activist Leslie Turner testified in opposition and said the measure is “just another way to funnel more people into the criminal legal system,” and does nothing to address the causes of cruelty, including “mental health struggles, childhood trauma, cycles of violence, economic instability.”\nA 1- to 10-year sentence, she noted, exceeds the 1- to 6-year sentence for child abuse. “How can we justify punishing someone more harshly for harming an animal than for harming a child? What does this say about our priorities?” she asked in written testimony, adding lawmakers should instead invest in “education, early intervention, and community-based mental health resources.”",

    "title": "Living on Purpose: Every day is a new opportunity to begin again",
    "text": "Living on Purpose: Every day is a new opportunity to begin again I hope everyone is having blessed holidays with family and friends. Spending time with those you love is much more meaningful than all the customs and traditions. The same is true with our spiritual lives, as it comes down to our personal relationship with God and the peace and joy we have living in His presence. I’ve spoken with several people over the last few weeks who have no family and spend holidays alone. However, they rejoice in the hope that comes from knowing God and trusting Him in everything. The New Year is a perfect time to examine where we are and where we would like to be and to appreciate all the good things that the past year has given us and all the blessings yet to come. January means “beginning” and as we plan our resolutions, they will most likely include developing physical, emotional and spiritual lifestyle changes. You notice I used the word \"developing\" because our goals are often a lengthy process. For example, eating a salad or taking a walk today is not going to automatically make us healthy, but it’s a positive first step that will pay off if we can embrace that secret weapon called perseverance. Let’s believe that anything is possible and just like all things in life, as optimism is a learned behavior, diligence and determination are important components of personal transformation. A lot can happen in a year and not everyone is in the mood for celebration. Many had difficulties and are trying to find the confidence to keep moving forward. Some have lost loved ones, or have received a negative health diagnosis, while others are filled with joy at the arrival of a child or grandchild, a new job, being wed, or buying a new home. As glasses are raised and fireworks explode into the sky, it’s important to remember that character is the ability to carry out a realistic strategy long after the excitement of the moment has passed. If after a couple of weeks, you sense you are failing do not allow discouragement to intimidate you. May we realize that every day is a new opportunity to begin again. Albert Einstein is quoted as saying, “Learn from yesterday, live for today, and have hope for tomorrow.” There have been many adaptations from the original Al-anon credo that encourage everyone to be realistic about trying to change everything all at once, as it’s important to realize that changing who we are is a lifestyle and not just a whim. No one else can do this for us. We must see our need to change and be willing to do whatever it takes to be victorious. There is nothing wrong with having long-term goals, but it’s also important to focus on our mission one day at a time. Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying, “How few there are who have the courage to own their faults, and the resolution to mend them.” It would be better to take it slow with permanent results than to go through the motions quickly become overwhelmed with frustration and eventually give up. I’m sorry for what many of you walked through last year, and we know that God is the only one who brings spiritual comfort in times of sorrow. Read John 14:27. I encourage you to think big and believe that nothing is impossible as you consider the old saying, “A ship in the harbor is safe, but that’s not what a ship is built for.” May we begin each day with gratitude and forgive those who have wronged us. Ephesians 4:32 says, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, as Christ God forgave you.” Let’s laugh more and take the time to consider those around us and how much they mean to us. We have the choice to see the glass half-full and to bring hope and love at a time when the world needs it the most. John Bunyan is quoted as saying, “You have not lived today until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.” Our decisions contribute to our destiny and having a clear conscience is the path to living in spiritual contentment. Edith Lovejoy Pierce is quoted as saying, “We will open the book. The pages are blank. We are going to write the words ourselves. The book is called Opportunity, and its first chapter is New Year’s Day.” Dr. Billy Holland is a minister, chaplain, and author. Read more about the Christian life at billyhollandministries.com.",

    "text": "Text size Volkswagen on Friday rejected as unrealistic a union proposal to make cost cuts at the carmaker's German operations without having to close factories, sparking anger from worker representatives as strikes loom.\nThe crisis-wracked auto titan has been locked in bitter talks with unions since announcing in September that it was mulling the unprecedented step of shuttering plants in Germany.\nThe powerful IG Metall union has indicated industrial action could start from December 1 if Volkswagen does not withdraw the drastic plans.\nVW has been hit hard by high manufacturing costs at home, a stuttering shift to electric vehicles and tough competition in key market China.\nAhead of the latest round of talks last week, the union and VW's works councils put forward a series of proposals they said would save 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in labour costs without the need for site closures.\nThese included proposals for management and staff to waive bonuses. The union also said it could drop a demand for pay rises in exchange for working shorter hours at some factories.\nBut Volkswagen said it had concluded that, while the measures could help in the short term, they would not lead \"to any long-term financial relief for the company in the coming years\".\n\"A sustainable saving of 1.5 billion euros cannot be determined even after intensive analysis,\" said the group, whose brands range from Audi to Skoda and Seat, in a statement.\nIG Metall described VW's response as \"extremely regrettable\", accusing it of \"ignoring the constructive proposals of the employee representatives\".\nVW was continuing to insist on \"extreme positions\", a union spokesman said, adding that the automaker \"has yet to answer the question of what steps it is willing to take to meet the employees halfway\".\nWorker representatives say at least three VW plants are at risk of closure in Germany and tens of thousands of jobs could go, with remaining employees facing hefty pay cuts.\nThe two sides are set for fresh talks on December 9.\nsr/fz/db",

    "text": "“Raised the daughter of a Hindu Brahmin priest, there was always a fug of disdain in our house for meat eating. My parents were, as were many first generation immigrants, keen horticulturalists who grew spinach, beets, radishes, squashes ... and used and cooked every part of them. Stems, flowers, leaves and even the peelings. Hinduism, you see, suggests that the fierce energy used to digest heavy meats should be channelled into philosophy and deep thought, into fathoming how to make the world a better place. In India, eateries will presume you are vegetarian – a minor area of the menu will be labelled “non-veg items”, from which one may order with a little blush of shame. While I am not a vegetarian or vegan, I, like many others, have wholeheartedly embraced the need to eat less meat and more veg, both for my own health and that of the planet”. extracted from Meat Free Mowgli by [Nisha Katona (](https://foodanddrink.scotsman.com/general/nisha-katona-of-mowgli-interview/)Nourish, [£12](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Meat-Free-Mowgli-Delicious-Plant-Based/dp/1848994117)) Angry cauliflower This is basically the Mowgli Angry Bird, but plant-based. There’s something luxurious about serving up a whole, roasted cauliflower that has drunk in the hot, spicy marinade to become soft and yielding, but fiery in colour and flavour. You could serve it with some turmeric-rubbed roast potatoes and my Indian Green Chopped Salad. It’s also lovely served with a simple lemon-dressed green salad and a raita. If you wanted to make this an even more hearty dish, you could serve it on a bed of warm whole grains. It’s very versatile, so make it your own. SERVES 6-8 400g Greek yogurt 1 tsp ground turmeric ½ tsp chilli powder 2 tsp ground cumin 2 tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder 2 tbsp tandoori masala 5cm /2in piece of fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped or grated 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated 1½ tsp salt juice of ½ lemon 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 whole baby cauliflower (about 600g) fresh green salad, to serve 1 Add all the ingredients, except the cauliflower, to a large mixing bowl. Mix well and taste for seasoning. 2 Use a sharp knife to make deep cuts in the entire surface of the cauliflower. Add the cauliflower to the marinade and use your hands to rub the marinade all over. Cover, then leave to marinate in the refrigerator overnight. 3 When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6 and line a baking sheet with baking parchment. 4 Place the cauliflower on the baking sheet and roast it in the oven for 45 minutes–1 hour, or until cooked through. A sharp knife or skewer should easily go all the way through the cauliflower with no resistance. 5 Serve whole or slice up for your guests to enjoy with a green salad or raita. Aubergine dhansak This is a vegetarian take on the classic Parsi dish of meat (usually mutton) cooked in a lentil and vegetable base, known as dhansak. The Parsi community originally migrated from Persia to India, settling on the coast of Gujarat. Their cuisine still heavily reflects their ancient Persian origins. Hearty and comforting, a good dhansak should be spicy, tangy and a little sweet. Here, aubergine/eggplant replaces the traditional mutton and soaks up the flavours of the sauce just as beautifully. It can easily be eaten on its own or with some chapatis and brown rice. A simple kachumber (onion and cucumber salad) makes a perfect side dish. SERVES 4 100g dried red lentils 3 garlic cloves 2.5cm/1in piece of fresh ginger 3 tbsp vegetable oil 1 cinnamon stick 1 red onion, finely chopped 1 large aubergine/eggplant, finely chopped 1 potato, finely chopped 1 tsp salt, or as needed 2 tomatoes, roughly chopped 1 tbsp tomato purée/paste 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander ¼ tsp chilli powder ½ tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp sugar, or as needed up to 450ml/15fl oz/scant 2 cups boiling water 2 handfuls of kale, leaves only, torn juice of ½ lemon 2 tsp garam masala 1 In a bowl, cover the dried lentils with boiling water and leave to soak for 20 minutes. 2 Blitz the garlic and ginger to a fine paste in a food processor. 3 Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, wide pan that has a lid over a medium heat. When hot, add the cinnamon and stir for 30 seconds, or until fragrant, then add the red onion. Cook for 4–5 minutes, then stir in the garlic and ginger paste and cook for a further minute. Add the chopped aubergine and potato with the salt and stir together before adding the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, spices and the sugar. Cover with the pan lid and cook for 8–10 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften. 4 Add the lentils, plus their soaking liquid, and 350ml/12fl oz/scant 11/2 cups of the boiling water to the pan. Cover and simmer for a further 10–15 minutes, or until the lentils and vegetables are cooked and soft. Keep an eye on the water level and don’t let it get too dry. 5 Stir in the kale until wilted, then add the lemon juice and garam masala. Before serving, taste for seasoning, adding salt or sugar, as needed. Add more water if it’s looking a bit dry. Baked rose yogurt This is a typical Bengali dessert. Baked yogurt is gently sweetened with a light tang and has a firm texture rather like cheesecake. For a pretty pink colour, try to find a genuine Indian rose syrup (in the Asian aisles of supermarkets or in Indian grocers). Other rose syrups will not give such a depth of colour, but will still taste wonderful. You can either make this in a large dish or in individual dishes. Either way, it is the perfect dessert for entertaining as it can be made ahead of time and is super easy. SERVES 4 250g full-fat Greek yogurt 125g condensed milk 3 tbsp rose syrup 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tbsp finely chopped pistachios 1 tbsp dried rose petals 1 Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4. Bring a kettle of water to the boil. 2 In a jug, mix together the Greek yogurt and condensed milk until well combined without any lumps, then add the rose syrup and vanilla extract. 3 Place 4 ovenproof ramekins in a baking dish, then carefully divide the yogurt mixture among them.

    "text": "Тренд укрепляется год от года.\nС начала 2025 года почти три тысячи соискателей в возрасте от 60 лет нашли работу с помощью службы занятости населения Красноярского края. Жители региона трудоустроены в разных отраслях экономики, пишет newslab.ru. Государственную поддержку в поиске работы люди старшего возраста получают в рамках нацпроекта «Кадры».\nСтаршее поколение тюменцев остается востребованным на рынке трудаВ 2024 году 1402 жителя региона воспользовались возможностью бесплатного обучения.\nКроме того, по государственной программе Красноярского края «Содействие занятости населения» в этом году к профессиональному обучению приступили 49 пенсионеров. Среди них — кондитеры, лифтеры, операторы ЭВМ, архивариусы, ландшафтные дизайнеры и другие работники.\nВ этом году краевая служба занятости специально для граждан старше 60 лет провела уже 40 ярмарок вакансий.\nСоискатели категории 60+ обладают ценными знаниями и навыками. Они могут быть наставниками для молодых специалистов, что также повышает их конкурентоспособность на рынке труда. Компании охотно берут к себе таких кандидатов на работу с гибким графиком, удалённым форматом, на вакансии с частичной или временной занятостью.\nПример успешной карьеры в зрелом возрасте продемонстрировала жительница Дивногорска. В свои 64 года с помощью центра занятости она продолжила профессионально развиваться и теперь работает заведующей магазина.\nВсего в этом году при содействии краевой службы занятости трудоустроены более 16 тысяч граждан. Уровень безработицы в регионе составляет 0,6%.\nФото: нейросеть",
