Across the 13 original albums and re-releases that have topped the charts, Swift has spent 68 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the most for any solo artist. Only The Beatles have more weeks at No. 1, cataloguing 132 weeks atop the charts across 19 albums. According to Billboard, Swift’s first No. 1 album was her sophomore album \"Fearless,\" which spent 11 weeks atop the list in 2008 and 2009. Her third album \"Speak Now\" spent six weeks at No. 1 in 2010 and 2011), \"Red\" was No. 1 for seven weeks in 2012 and 2013, and \"1989\" spent 11 weeks at No. 1, \"Reputation\" four weeks, and \"Lover\" held the throne for just one week. \"Folklore,\" \"Evermore,\" \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" and \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" earned the artist a collective 15 weeks at No. 1 between 2020 and 2021. \"Midnights\" spent six weeks at the top, and in 2023 \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" held the top spot for two weeks and \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" just marked its fifth week atop the charts. Swift had quite a year in 2023, making history time and time again. Her \"Eras Tour\" made more than a billion dollars, and the accompanying concert film raked in a record $200 million its opening weekend. She was named \"Person of the Year\" by [TIME magazine in December.](https://www.wqad.com/article/news/nation-world/taylor-swift-time-person-of-the-year/507-88cc1e19-d378-4de0-85a1-e2d9afa46520)",

    "title": "Bernie Moreno accepts support from key player in HB 6 scandal | wkyc.com",
    "text": "During the GOP U.S. Senate primary, Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno went after his opponents over their connections to the [biggest bribery and money-laundering scandal in Ohio history](/article/news/politics/fbi-agents-swarm-ohio-house-speaker-larry-householders-farm-in-connection-with-bribery-investigation/95-9113992a-c404-4b2d-842e-d090d304477e). But now he's welcoming the support of a man who brokered what was perhaps the key relationship in a scheme in which Akron-based FirstEnergy paid $61 million to purchase a $1.3 billion bailout that fell on the backs of ratepayers — which is to say everyday Ohioans. The supporter, Cleveland businessman Tony George, invited a now-convicted lawmaker to travel on FirstEnergy's private jet to Donald Trump's 2017 inaugural, and booked the lawmaker and FirstEnergy executives into the same hotel for days of events during which federal prosecutors say the conspiracy began. George was still communicating with the central players in 2020, when the FBI started making arrests. When asked to comment on the seeming hypocrisy, Moreno's campaign didn't respond directly. It instead attacked his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown. Crooked bailout A political newcomer, Moreno in March [sailed past](/article/news/politics/elections/cleveland-businessman-bernie-moreno-wins-republican-us-senate-primary-ohio/95-e54fa253-220b-416f-a40c-a49c5d774e1c) his more-experienced opponents buoyed by the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. Moreno was once a harsh Trump critic, calling him a \"lunatic\" and a \"maniac.\" But as with Ohio Sen. — and vice-presidential hopeful — JD Vance, Moreno got into politics and turned into an ardent supporter of Trump, who is now a [convicted felon](/article/news/nation-world/trump-trial-jury-deliberations-continue/507-36db2424-cf0c-48a6-a26c-bf046bc57584). Moreno might have experienced a similar conversion when it comes to 2019's corrupt bailout law, House Bill 6. In a Spectrum News 1 debate on Feb. 19, Moreno went after his Republican opponents, state Sen. Matt Dolan and Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Dolan in 2019 voted for HB 6, but then later told 3News' Stephanie Haney he supported a full repeal. LaRose, Ohio's top elections official, provided \"private\" information to FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones during a [brutal-but-successful](/article/news/local/ohio/larry-householder-trial-stalking-assault-alleged-repeal-fight-utility-bailout-ohio/95-233e43ec-2f46-45d0-b146-e64200919b0f) war to stop a repeal of the bailout, according to text messages from Jones that were presented during a criminal trial last year. LaRose at first refused to comment on the messages. Then last July, he said he didn't recall conversations with Jones and others involved in the scandal. As a result of the bailout conspiracy, former House Speaker Larry Householder, R-Glenford, last year received a [20-year prison sentence](/article/news/local/ohio/former-ohio-house-speaker-larry-householder-sentenced/530-2dd2485a-5143-4f13-bb3a-e8153b205232) and former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges was [sentenced to five years](/article/news/local/ohio/lobbyist-matt-borges-gets-5-years-for-role-in-60m-bribery-scheme/530-926cbc7e-1be3-4263-8a9c-720c4f914aa9). Jones and former FirstEnergy Vice President Michael Dowling were [charged by state authorities](/article/news/local/ohio/house-bill-6-scandal-indictments-ohio-attorney-general-dave-yost/95-72fe0337-f5e6-4191-9973-f5cb7fac4af0) earlier this year, while ex-Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chairman Sam Randazzo also faced state and federal charges before [dying by suicide](/article/news/local/ohio/sam-randazzo-former-puco-chairman-indicted-ohio-house-bill-6-scandal-dead-suicide/95-87190d86-9281-4eec-85c8-8e71a3f99138) in April. About 19-and-a-half minutes into February's GOP Senate debate, LaRose attacked Moreno over what LaRose said was Moreno's support for government subsidies of wind and solar energy. Moreno swung back with HB 6, the corrupt bailout law. \"I was against HB 6,\" Moreno said. \"These guys weren't. They're going to have to answer for their involvement in that scandal to a different audience than the one that's here tonight.\" Moreno previously took another swing at Dolan in an April 30, 2022 post on X, linking to an Ohio Capital Journal article [posted on WKYC.com](/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-utility-regulator-lobbied-legislation-save-firstenergy-millions-texts-show/95-d9ee22fb-e4ad-4a80-ae9c-426d9d9826b1). Support from 'Individual B' That last sentence was an apparent swipe at the Dolan family's ownership of Cleveland's Major League Baseball team. In 2021, it changed its name from the Indians to the Guardians in response to Native American protests — to the fury of some of its fans. But as for Moreno's problems with figures who were involved in the bailout scandal, they appear to extend only to his political opponents — not his supporters. On May 16, his campaign held a Bourbon With Bernie fundraiser in Mentor. Cleveland businessman Tony George was a host, a privilege for which George paid $2,500 . In addition to being a Moreno supporter, George has had a long and lucrative relationship with FirstEnergy. Entities linked to George received nearly $11 million from FirstEnergy over the years, according to a state audit. Unlike FirstEnergy's two top executives, Randazzo, Householder, Borges and three others, George has not been charged in the conspiracy, and there's been no public indication that state or federal authorities plan to. But George's role was substantial enough that he was called \"Individual B\" in FirstEnergy's [deferred prosecution agreement](/article/news/local/firstenergy-charged-agrees-to-pay-230-million-penalty-in-connection-to-hb-6-bribery-scheme/530-2d935458-73f7-4d4a-a806-dbee93822922) — a document in which the utility copped to its culpability for the bribery scandal, along with paying out $230 million. It lays out Individual B's close relationship with FirstEnergy's top executive and to Householder from the fall of 2016, when Householder was plotting his return to the House and then to regain the speaker's gavel. During his trial, Householder implausibly testified that during the 2016 World Series between the Indians and Chicago Cubs, he randomly wandered into the FirstEnergy luxury box at Cleveland's Progressive Field. Raising doubts that his visit was just happenstance, the deferred prosecution agreement includes a message from Jones, the FirstEnergy CEO, to George on Nov. 5, 2016 — just three days after Game 7 of the World Series. \"Pass on to (Householder),\" Jones said. \"When we were talking on (Wednesday, the day of Game 7) I told him there was gonna be a sense of urgency (for a bailout) but couldn't tell him all the details. If we don't move on some type of supplant (sic) in (the) first half of 2017 it will be too late. These (nuclear) plants will be shut, sold, or bankrupt. I don't have any contact info for him.\" George responded, \"He's more than ready to craft something,\" federal prosecutors said in closing arguments in Householder's trial. Expensive junket The following January, George invited Householder — and flew with him, Householder's son and FirstEnergy Vice President Michael Dowling — on the FirstEnergy jet to the Trump inaugural. George also booked Householder and then-CEO Jones into the same D.C. hotel. What followed were days of [swanky steak dinners](/article/news/local/ohio/ex-ohio-house-speaker-larry-householder-denies-dinners-firstenergy-execs/95-151a9cf1-6126-4b0a-aca8-e4825671e941) and other events during which prosecutors said the bailout scheme was hatched. FirstEnergy's deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, says that George continued as a conduit between Householder and Jones until 2020, when Householder was arrested. Before the feds brought the hammer down, Jones, George and Householder were plotting to change the Ohio Constitution so Householder could continue as speaker for another 16 years . That would have allowed them to continue to increase electricity rates and use the resulting dark money to dominate Ohio government in ways not calculated to benefit ratepayers, or the public at large. The DPA includes messages between Jones and George on Feb. 28, 2020. Jones referred to Householder as \"an expensive friend,\" but said it would be valuable to keep him in his position of power because, as Householder said, he could \"get a lot done in 16 years.\" George agreed, saying, \"Probably more than 5 previous Speakers combined.\" Then, George added, \"He will make Ohio great again.\" Response The Moreno campaign this week declined to answer questions about these matters on the record. It was asked whether Moreno was aware of George's involvement in the HB 6 affair when Moreno accepted George's support. It was also asked if Moreno would return George's money and decline support in the future. Communications Director Reagan McCarthy responded by asking in an email, \"When is Sherrod Brown going to return the donations made to his campaign over the years including when FirstEnergy admitted it was bribing public officials?\" In fact, Brown donated the $21,000 he'd received from FirstEnergy over the years to Ohio food banks within 10 days of Householder's 2020 arrest, according to Federal Election Commission records provided by the Brown campaign. \"While Bernie continues to actively fundraise with key players of the FirstEnergy bribery scandal, days after the FirstEnergy scandal was revealed, the Friends of Sherrod Brown campaign donated FirstEnergy contributions to local food banks across the state,\" a spokesperson said in an email.

    "title": "Mark Zeigler: An ailing Olympic movement turns to Paris for salvation",
    "text": "By Mark Zeigler - The San Diego Union-Tribune (TNS) ,\n28 minutes ago PARIS — The new sport for the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, which open Friday here and continue for 17 days, is breaking.\nIt is more commonly known as break dancing, but the dancing part has been removed, presumably, to deflect criticism and encourage its acceptance as a worthy athletic competition. It also fits the Paris Games in more semantic ways.\nBecause the goal, the hope, the aspiration of these Olympics, truly, is breaking.\nBreaking with the recent trend of flawed Games, either from authoritarian governments (Sochi and Beijing), overwhelmed organizers (Rio de Janeiro), remote locales (Pyeongchang) or pandemic restrictions (Tokyo).\nBreaking with the habit of building new venues that instantly become white elephants when the flame is extinguished at closing ceremonies.\nBreaking even financially, avoiding the tsunami of cost overruns and red ink that have sunk past host cities.\nBreaking with tradition, hosting the athletes’ parade before Friday’s opening ceremony on 94 barges over a four-mile stretch of the River Seine instead of monotonously marching into a stadium.\n“It’s not perfect, it’s never perfect,” said Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris organizing committee and a three-time gold medalist in whitewater canoe. “I remember when I crossed the finish line when I was an athlete with the gold medal, I didn’t make a perfect run. Perfect is never the case, but it’s also important to assess what we are willing to deliver.\n“We dared to be audacious, to be ambitious, to make sure the Games will not be the same as the previous editions.”\nThey arrive at an inflection point in the Olympic movement, with declining viewership, with increasing cynicism from doping and corruption scandals, with cities reluctant to submit host bids, with longtime sponsors departing, with rising terrorist threats, with political decisions jeopardizing its purportedly neutral image.\nParis’ great advantage, and Los Angeles in 2028, is that it isn’t using the Olympics to attract tourism or revitalize a region or launder a political ideology through the interlocking rings.\nA Frenchman, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, created the modern Games in 1896 after seeing a model of ancient Olympia at the Paris Exposition. The city has hosted the Summer Games twice, in 1900 and 1924. France has hosted the Winter Games three times and will make it four in 2030 in the Alps.\nThe 1900 Games didn’t go so well, spread over five months with a litany of obscure sports such as equestrian high jump and a swimming obstacle race where competitors dove under a row of boats in the Seine.\nParis got another shot in 1924 and began shaping the current Olympics, introducing the “Citius, altius, fortius” motto (faster, higher, stronger) and a dedicated athlete village of wooden shacks. Johnny Weissmuller won two gold medals in swimming before starring as Tarzan in Hollywood movies. Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi took home five golds in track and field.\nThis, then, is about reshaping the Olympics. Resuscitating, revitalizing, reimagining, rebooting them.\n“Light up people’s hearts,” French President Emmanuel Macron says.\nOne thing that hasn’t changed from 1900 is swimming in the River Seine. The swimming competition was held there back then, which the competitors liked because a) the river wasn’t as polluted then and b) the strong current meant world record times.\nFrance spent $1.5 billion in a massive clean-up campaign in order to stage a triathlon leg and marathon swimming there, with mixed reviews. A protest movement with the threat #JeChieDansLaSeine (literally, “I poop in the Seine”) claims the water quality is still unhealthy, prompting Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo to take a dip herself in wetsuit and goggles.\nOther venues, most of them in cost-efficient existing or temporary structures, have equally historic and photogenic backdrops.\nBeach volleyball is in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, fencing and taekwondo in a renovated Grand Palais, skateboarding and breaking at Place de la Concorde, equestrian at the Chateau de Versailles, judo and wrestling at the Champ de Mars exhibition hall, the marathon start at Hotel de Ville, the road cycling course up Montmartre hill past the Sacre-Coeur basilica, tennis on the famed red clay of Roland-Garros.\nSurfing is on a reef break off the French Polynesian island of Tahiti. Sailing is on the Cote d’Azur in Marseille.\nThe Olympic flame will be displayed not in a stadium but Jardin des Tuileries, a palace garden created by Catherine de Medici in the 1500s on the fashionable Right Bank of the Seine not far from the Louvre Museum.\n“It’s been very rich,” Christophe Dubi, the Olympic Games executive director for the IOC, said of their journey with the Paris organizing committee, “with people that always had this attitude of, ‘Let’s create, let’s innovate, although Paris offers a lot of history and culture, let’s use this to make it something very special.’ ”\nIt’s not perfect, as Estanguet says, it’s never perfect. Not when you bring 11 million visitors to see 10,714 athletes from 206 nations compete in 329 events over 754 sessions in 35 venues.\nThe biggest challenge is security in a city that has suffered several major terrorist attacks, including one in 2015 that killed 130 people and was attributed to the Islamic State as retaliation for French air strikes in Syria and Iraq.\nThe result is what is considered the largest peacetime security operation in French history, with 45,000 officers drawn from police, military and dozens of foreign countries. In the past few days, groups of uniformed soldiers have appeared on street corners with guns slung across their chests while police are regularly posted at Metro stations. Speed boats with armed officers zoom up and down the Seine. Divers patrol beneath the surface.\nA no-fly zone with a 100-mile radius will be imposed from 6:30 p.m. to midnight during opening ceremonies, forcing commercial airlines to cancel flights into area airports. Drones have been banned, and police estimate they are intercepting six per day, most by unknowing tourists.\nFrance’s interior minister said more than 4,000 Olympic credentials have been rejected on suspicion of being foreign spies or having radical Islamist ties. On Tuesday, authorities raided the Paris apartment of a 40-year-old, Russian-born chef, alleging he was “conducting intelligence work on behalf of a foreign power … to provoke hostilities in France” through a large-scale attack during the Games.\nThere also was a YouTube video posted this week of a masked person claiming Hamas would turn Paris into “rivers of blood” in retaliation for France’s support of Israel’s invasion of Palestine. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has since questioned its validity.\n“We’re not sure,” Attal told media, “but it looks like it is fake and has been spread by pro-Kremlin and pro-Russian channels.”\nThe other fear is a crippling Russian-backed cyberattack on Games-related computer systems. The Russian team has been banned from the Olympics as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine, although some individual Russian athletes are allowed to compete independently with no national association.\nAll this plays out amid the backdrop of political instability in France. Macron dissolved the National Assembly last month and called for snap elections, with no party receiving a majority of seats to form a new government without creating a coalition. Attal has resigned but agreed to stay on through the Games operating a government without the power to pass laws.\nBut the Games must go on. They always do.\nThe hope is the athletes come to the rescue and provide the ultimate diversion: Simone Biles in gymnastics, Katie Ledecky in the pool, LeBron James on the basketball court, 400-meter hurdler Sydney McLauglin-Levrone on the track, along with French stars like swimmer Leon Marchand, rugby player Antoine Dupont and 7-foot-4 NBA phenom Victor Wembayama.\nThe $10 billion budget, thanks to strong ticket sales and only a handful of new venues, so far is manageable. The Olympic rings hang majestically from the Eiffel Tower. Pollution levels in the Seine remain low. The famed Gallic indifference of Parisians appears to be waning. The opening ceremony dancers called off a threatened strike after receiving a new pay offer.\nThere are reports that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga will partner on a duet of a 1940s song by French singer Edith Piaf, “La Vie en rose.”\nA rough translation: Life in rosy hues.\n©2024 The San Diego Union-Tribune.
