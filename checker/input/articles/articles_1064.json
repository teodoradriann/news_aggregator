    "text": "New York, Dec 23 A prominent Hindu temple in the US state of California has been vandalised by pro-Khalistan elements with anti-Modi graffiti, leaving the members of the community in shock. prominent Hindu temple in the US state of California has been vandalised by pro-Khalistan elements with anti-Modi graffiti, leaving the members of the community in shock. The walls of Shree Swaminarayan Mandir in Newark, Bay Area, were spray painted on Friday with graffiti targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and eulogising Khalistan leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. \"Whatever happened last night was a clear act of vandalism and violence against the Indian community,\" Chintan Pandya, a member of the temple, told CBS News. He said the incident is \"concerning\" as it is the first time the temple has seen something like this ever since its opening almost two years ago. \"It is not safe for the community,\" Pandya said, adding that the temple leaders will be having a special meeting to discuss the incident. US-based advocacy organisation, Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA), said a thorough and urgent action is needed to address growing Hinduphobia in the region. \"Freedom of religion means little when sacred spaces that are meant to be an oasis of peace and calm, are vandalised with no consequences. We are sad but not shocked -- authorities, media and other groups have regularly downplayed or ignored the growing #Hinduphobia in the region,\" CoHNA said in a post on X on Friday. \"People who put those symbols and names up...what they are promoting is a separate state of Khalistan... So if those people who did this want that, that's something that I think most Americans, most Indians, most Hindus don't want,\" Mihir Meghani, co-founder of Hindu American Foundation, told CBS News. Meghani said the Indian-American community in the Bay Area is growing, and these political issues are now becoming a part of the division here. The incident comes just after the US Justice Department unsealing an indictment against an Indian national for his alleged involvement in a foiled plot to kill New York-based Khalistan leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.

    "title": "Is it OK to cook smelly fish?",
    "text": "Is it OK to Cook Smelly Fish? A Deep Dive into Fish Freshness and Food Safety Unequivocally, the answer is NO . Cooking smelly fish is not okay and is strongly discouraged. A pungent, fishy, or ammonia-like odor in fish is a clear indicator of spoilage. Consuming spoiled fish can lead to food poisoning and a range of unpleasant symptoms. Trust your senses; if it smells bad, discard it.\nUnderstanding Fish Spoilage: Why Does Fish Smell? Fish begins to spoil almost immediately after it’s caught. This spoilage is caused by several factors:\nEnzymatic Activity: Enzymes present in the fish’s flesh continue to break down proteins and fats even after death. Bacterial Action: Bacteria, both naturally present on the fish and from the environment, multiply and break down compounds in the fish. Oxidation: Fats in the fish can react with oxygen, leading to rancidity and off-flavors. The characteristic “fishy” smell is primarily due to the breakdown of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) , a compound found in marine fish. Bacteria convert TMAO into trimethylamine (TMA) , which has a strong, ammonia-like odor. The longer the fish sits, the more TMA is produced, and the stronger the smell becomes. This pungent odor signals that the fish is no longer fresh and may be unsafe to eat.\nRecognizing Fresh Fish: What to Look and Smell For Distinguishing fresh fish from spoiled fish is crucial for your health. Here are the key indicators of fresh fish:\nSmell: Fresh fish should have a mild, sea-like smell or no smell at all. Some describe it as smelling like fresh-cut grass or cucumbers. It should never smell overly fishy, sour, or ammonia-like. Appearance: The flesh should be firm, moist, and shiny, with no discoloration. Fillets should be bright pink, red (for salmon), or white, depending on the species. Avoid fish with a dull, slimy, or milky appearance. Eyes: Whole fish should have bright, clear, and bulging eyes. Sunken or cloudy eyes are a sign of spoilage. Gills: The gills should be bright red or pink and moist. Gray, brown, or slimy gills indicate that the fish is old. Texture: Fresh fish should be firm to the touch and spring back when pressed. Mushy or slimy textures are signs of spoilage. The Dangers of Eating Spoiled Fish: Food Poisoning Risks Consuming spoiled fish can lead to various forms of food poisoning, including:\nScombroid Poisoning (Histamine Toxicity): This is the most common type of fish-related food poisoning. Certain fish, such as tuna, mackerel, and mahi-mahi, contain high levels of histidine . When these fish are not properly refrigerated, bacteria convert histidine into histamine . Even after cooking, histamine remains, and consuming fish with high histamine levels can cause symptoms like flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching, and rash. Bacterial Infections: Spoiled fish can harbor harmful bacteria like Salmonella , Listeria , and Clostridium . These bacteria can cause a range of symptoms, from mild gastrointestinal distress to severe infections. Parasitic Infections: While cooking typically kills parasites, consuming raw or undercooked fish can lead to parasitic infections like anisakiasis (from roundworms) or diphyllobothriasis (from tapeworms). Masking the Smell: Why It Doesn’t Work Some people try to mask the smell of spoiled fish with lemon juice, vinegar, or other seasonings. While these may temporarily reduce the odor, they do not eliminate the toxins or bacteria that cause food poisoning. Attempting to mask the smell is a risky practice that can lead to serious health consequences.\nMilk Soak: Does it Really Work? Soaking fish in milk is a common practice believed to reduce fishy odors. The casein in milk binds to some of the volatile amines, like TMA, that cause the fishy smell. While this may slightly reduce the odor, it doesn’t eliminate the underlying spoilage or make the fish safe to eat if it’s already gone bad. If the fish has a strong, putrid smell, soaking it in milk will not magically make it fresh. However, for fish that has just a mild odor, soaking it in milk for about 20 minutes might help improve its flavor and aroma.\nSafe Handling and Storage of Fish: Preventing Spoilage Proper handling and storage are essential to prevent fish spoilage. Here are some tips:\nBuy from Reputable Sources: Purchase fish from trusted markets or suppliers that follow proper food safety practices. Keep it Cold: Store fish in the refrigerator at 40°F (4°C) or below. Use ice packs to keep fish cold during transport. Use it Quickly: Consume fresh fish within 1-2 days of purchase. If you can’t use it that quickly, freeze it. Proper Thawing: Thaw frozen fish in the refrigerator, not at room temperature. Avoid Cross-Contamination: Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw fish and other foods. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw fish. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Fish Freshness 1. What does “fishy” smell really mean? A “fishy” smell in fish is generally caused by the presence of trimethylamine (TMA) , a compound produced as fish spoils. The stronger the smell, the more TMA is present, indicating a higher level of spoilage.\n2. Is it safe to eat fish that smells slightly fishy if it looks fine? Even if fish looks visually appealing, a noticeable fishy smell is a warning sign. It’s generally best to err on the side of caution and avoid eating fish with any off-putting odor.\n3. Can cooking spoiled fish kill the bacteria and make it safe to eat? While cooking can kill some bacteria, it doesn’t eliminate all toxins produced by spoilage. For example, histamine in scombroid poisoning is heat-stable and won’t be destroyed by cooking. Therefore, cooking spoiled fish doesn’t guarantee safety.\n4. How long can I store raw fish in the refrigerator? Raw fish should be stored in the refrigerator at 40°F (4°C) or below for no more than 1-2 days.\n5. How can I tell if frozen fish has gone bad? Signs of freezer burn (dry, discolored patches) can affect the texture and flavor of frozen fish, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s unsafe. However, if the fish has a strong odor or appears slimy after thawing, it should be discarded.\n6. What is the best way to thaw frozen fish? The safest way to thaw frozen fish is in the refrigerator . Place the fish in a sealed bag or container to prevent leaks and contamination.\n7. Can I refreeze thawed fish? Refreezing thawed fish is generally not recommended , as it can degrade the quality and texture. However, if the fish was thawed in the refrigerator and remains cold, refreezing it may be possible, but the quality will be compromised.\n8. What are the symptoms of scombroid poisoning? Symptoms of scombroid poisoning can include flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching, rash, rapid heartbeat, and dizziness . These symptoms usually appear within a few minutes to an hour after eating spoiled fish.\n9. What should I do if I suspect I have scombroid poisoning? If you suspect you have scombroid poisoning, seek medical attention immediately. While symptoms are usually mild and resolve on their own, severe cases may require treatment.\n10. Are some types of fish more prone to scombroid poisoning? Yes, fish such as tuna, mackerel, mahi-mahi, and amberjack are more prone to scombroid poisoning because they naturally contain higher levels of histidine.\n11. How can I prevent scombroid poisoning? To prevent scombroid poisoning, ensure that fish is properly refrigerated from the moment it’s caught until it’s cooked. Avoid consuming fish that has been left at room temperature for an extended period.\n12. Does marinating fish make it safe to eat if it smells slightly off? No , marinating fish does not make it safe to eat if it smells slightly off. Marinating may mask the odor but does not eliminate the harmful bacteria or toxins that cause food poisoning.\n13. Why does my fridge smell like fish even when there’s no fish inside? A fishy smell in your fridge can indicate several issues, such as problems with the fan, a failed compressor, or a burnt start-up relay , leading to stagnant moisture. It could also be a lingering odor from spilled fish oils or previous spoilage. Thoroughly clean your fridge with baking soda and water to eliminate the odor.\n14. Can I trust the “sell-by” or “use-by” date on fish packaging? “Sell-by” or “use-by” dates are helpful guidelines, but they don’t guarantee freshness . Always use your senses (smell, sight, and touch) to determine if the fish is still safe to eat.\n15. Where can I learn more about food safety and environmental health? You can learn more about food safety and environmental health from reputable sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Environmental Literacy Council at enviroliteracy.org .\nIn conclusion, when it comes to fish, trusting your senses is paramount. A strong, unpleasant smell is a clear warning sign that the fish is spoiled and should not be consumed. Prioritize food safety by purchasing fish from reputable sources, storing it properly, and being vigilant about signs of spoilage. When in doubt, throw it out!",
