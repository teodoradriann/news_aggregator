    "title": "UAW rallies as Stellantis announces job cuts amid Michigan plant investments",
    "text": "A day after Stellantis announced $406 million in investments across three of its Michigan plants, the United Auto Workers (UAW) held a rally to emphasize that despite the automaker’s financial commitments, significant job cuts are looming at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant . The automaker’s plans to eliminate the second shift at the plant, which could affect nearly 2,500 jobs, were the focal point of the gathering on Thursday at UAW Local 140 in Warren, Michigan.\nUAW President Shawn Fain, addressing a crowd of union members and politicians, acknowledged Stellantis’ recent investments but stressed that they only represent a fraction of the company’s contractual commitments. Stellantis’ investment at Sterling Heights Assembly Plant will fund the production of the electric Ram 1500 REV pickup, while Warren Truck will build an electrified Jeep Wagoneer, and Dundee Engine will handle battery-related production. Fain criticized the company, noting that the investment at Warren Truck is just 17% of its pledged amount, and Stellantis has met only 2% of its commitments under the UAW agreement nationwide.\nFain also raised concerns about the future of the idled Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, warning that the union could escalate to a national strike if the company fails to meet its obligations. “What affects one of us affects all of us,” Fain declared, signaling that the union will fully enforce its contract, even to the point of striking if necessary.\nStellantis has denied violating any agreements, emphasizing in a statement that the company is focused on adapting to industry changes and ensuring future growth. The company highlighted its $97 million investment in Warren Truck as part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance competitiveness as it transitions to a sustainable mobility tech company.\nThe rally underscored the tension between Stellantis and the UAW amid declining sales, falling profits, and a shrinking market share. Once celebrating high profits, Stellantis is now trailing behind major competitors like General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, and Honda in the U.S. market. UAW President Fain has openly criticized Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, calling him “a terrible CEO.”\nLocal 140 President Eric Graham, who led the rally, said the event aimed to demonstrate unity among union members as the plant faces layoffs. Eliminating the second shift at Warren Truck, where the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are produced, will leave over 1,500 workers on indefinite layoff. Despite low morale at the plant, Graham urged members not to lose hope, highlighting the UAW’s resilience in past challenges.\nUnion members, including longtime employees like Gilbretta Hall, supported their colleagues facing layoffs. “We’re all feeling this,” Hall said, expressing solidarity with her fellow workers during this uncertain time.",

    "text": "A young mother in east Idaho named Rachael who is facing difficulty recently got a big surprise from a Secret Santa.\nIn May, Rachael was diagnosed with acute leukemia and her husband took her to a specialist in Salt Lake where she remained in the hospital for over a month, East Idaho News reported on Saturday.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, “Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made,” the site read .\n“The word ‘acute’ in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones,” it continued.\nRachael is back at home but must still undergo treatment that includes spinal taps and tests. When she finishes chemotherapy, doctors will have her take an expensive medication for the next several years.\nThe couple has two children and one of them has special needs. Therefore, Rachael is working hard to care for her family as she endures treatments for the illness.\nWhen the outlet’s Nate Eaton showed up at their home, he had a special message for them. The family needed an updated washer and dryer, so Secret Santa gave them $1,500 to purchase those appliances, grocery store gift cards for $2,500, $1,000 for clothes they need, and a $5,000 check.\nRachael was stunned when Eaton described each gift as she opened the packages.\n“I’m gonna start crying in a minute,” she said. “That’s so kind, thank you.”\nSocial media users share their thoughts on the big surprise, one person writing , “Rachael has a great attitude being surprised by strangers at her door with her ivs in her arm. What a sweet woman. Prayers she regains her health quickly.”\n“Wow!! She has such a sweet spirit. May the Lord bring total healing to her. Bless you Secret Santa,” another user commented .\nHealth Local Pre-Viral B Inspired News Christmas East Idaho News holiday Idaho Nate Eaton Secret Santa",

    "text": "La chanteuse britannique Marianne Faithfull est morte à l'âge de 78 ans\nLa chanteuse britannique Marianne Faithfull est morte à l'âge de 78 ans à Londres, a annoncé un porte-parole ce jeudi soir.\nLa chanteuse et actrice britannique Marianne Faithfull, connue pour sa chanson \"As Tears Go By\", est décédée à l'âge de 78 ans à Londres, a annoncé un porte-parole jeudi dans une déclaration transmise à l'AFP. \"C'est avec une profonde tristesse que nous annonçons le décès de la chanteuse, compositrice et actrice Marianne Faithfull. Elle s'est éteinte paisiblement à Londres aujourd'hui, en compagnie de sa famille. Elle nous manquera beaucoup\", est-il indiqué.\nMarianne Faithfull est née le 29 décembre 1946 à Londres d'un père officier, espion de Sa Majesté, et d'une baronne autrichienne d'origine juive hongroise. Égérie folk-rock des années 1960, la chanteuse est découverte par le manager des Rolling Stones, Andy Oldham. À 17 ans seulement, elle entre dans le Top 10 britannique avec \"As Tears Go By\" (1964), titre écrit par Mick Jagger et Keith Richards.\nMarquée par des hauts et des bas liés à des problèmes de toxicomanie, sa carrière l'a aussi menée au théâtre et au cinéma, sous la direction entre autres de Jean-Luc Godard, Sofia Coppola et Patrice Chéreau. Après \"As Tears Go By\", viennent d'autres succès : \"Come and Stay With Me\", \"This Little Bird\", \"Summer Nights\". Mais la chanteuse, alors compagne de Mick Jagger, est entraînée dans ce qu'elle appellera le \"cirque permanent\" des Stones et devient accro à l'héroïne.\nS'ensuivent, dans les années 1970, une tentative de suicide, la fin de sa relation avec Mick Jagger, la perte de la garde de son fils, né d'une précédente union, et une descente aux enfers dans les squats et les rues de Soho à Londres. Elle survit de justesse à une overdose, mais les drogues dures et la cigarette ont cassé sa voix. Après une période punk, pendant laquelle elle chante des textes mordants et désabusés comme \"Why D'Ya Do It?\", \"Working Class Hero\" de John Lennon, \"Broken English\" (1979), une cure de désintoxication lui permet de remonter la pente dans les années 1990. Elle était alors revenue à la musique, sur les planches, à la télévision et au cinéma.\n- \"As Tears Go By\" de Marianne Faithfull\nMarianne Faithfull - As Tears Go By (Official Lyric Video)",

Throughout the year, we’ll have a focus on prayer, with a special [emphasis on the Eucharist](https://aleteia.org/tag/real-presence/) as part of the ongoing Eucharistic revival. But already, the Aleteia archives has so many resources for our beautiful community. By clicking [here](https://aleteia.org/tag/prayer/), you can scroll through dozens (maybe hundreds!) of articles related to prayer, with offerings for young families, liturgical living, and many others. Then, I’d like to point out a special series created by our editorial director, [Dominican Father Peter John Cameron](https://aleteia.org/author/fr-peter-john-cameron-op/). It’s called [Prayer Is](https://aleteia.org/tag/prayer-is/), and each installment is a short, but incredibly insightful, reflection on one aspect of prayer.

    "title": "Morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy. The FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels. “The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance. Even then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.” People are also reading… Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms. Aaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said. Many highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms. Parker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels. “They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said. According to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked. The North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported. Marian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.” Heather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi. Mushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died. Before the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.” The FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert. The study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication. The study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms. Hallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs. In the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said. There hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",

    "text": "El éxito de [Dragon Ball](https://es.dragon-ball-official.com/) no sucedió de un día para otro. [Akira Toriyama](https://twitter.com/DB_official_en), a punta de su imaginación y experiencia, fue construyendo el monstruo en el que se terminó convirtiendo el más grande animé de toda la historia. Sin embargo, hubo un momento en el que tanta fama lo abrumó y estuvo a punto de lanzar la toalla por la enorme cantidad de trabajo que tenía. Simplemente quería dejar todo tirado y dedicarse a cualquier otra cosa, con tal de no tener que pasar tantas horas dentro del estudio dibujando personajes y creando las historias. De hecho, el arco de Freezer fue tan amplio y con un montón de episodios de relleno hechos por Toei Animation, precisamente porque Akira Toriyama y su equipo de trabajo no daban abasto en la publicación de nuevos capítulos. Entonces, el animé decidió rellenar por varios meses mientras Akira Toriyama terminaba de darle forma a la saga del Emperador del Universo. Para poder seguir adelante, el sensei acudió a dos trucos infalibles que lo ayudaron a que el trabajo fuese más rápido y así poder terminar, no sólo el arco de Freezer, sino continuar con el de Cell y los Androides, y el de Majin Buu, para después retirarse de Dragon Ball. Los trucos de Akira Toriyama 1) [Destruir todo: Akira Toriyama](https://www.fayerwayer.com/entretenimiento/2024/04/08/la-verdad-oculta-detras-de-la-destruccion-masiva-durante-los-combates-de-dragon-ball-explicado-por-akira-toriyama/) y sus dibujantes destruían todo lo más rápido posible para tener que realizar menos detalles en los diseños. “La verdad es que dibujar los fondos es bastante duro. Y dibujar una ciudad es duro de verdad... Todo el mundo se va haciendo fuerte y luchan, así que hay que destrozar la ciudad, ¿no? Por eso, cuando dibujo la ciudad ya planeo cómo destrozarla. Si sé cómo destrozarla entonces puedo dibujarla”, dice el genio creador de Dragon Ball. “Si mis asistentes tardan demasiado, entonces me toca dibujar a mi, por eso tengo ganas de destrozarla lo antes posible (risas). En el caso de la Capital Central me la cargo en la tercera viñeta. Ya tenía planes para destrozar la ciudad o el fondo que nos daba mucho trabajo. El escenario del Gran Torneo de las Artes Marciales también da mucho trabajo”, dice Akira Toriyama. 2) Transformaciones para cambiar el color del cabello: Pintar en negro les llevaba más tiempo. Es por eso que la transformación del Super Saiyajin es con cabello amarillo, para que los trazos sean más amigables para quienes pasan horas en los estudios ilustrando las obras de Dragon Ball.",

IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he would visit the Kursk nuclear plant next week, Russia’s permanent representative to the United Nations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, [said](https://t.me/ulyanov_mikhail/3158) on Wednesday. Ukrainian forces earlier this month fought their way across the Russian border into the Kursk region. They’ve remained in the area ever since, fighting with the Russian troops. Does Ukraine have anything to say about the alleged attack on the nuclear plant? Ukraine did not comment publicly on the allegations that it attacked the Kursk nuclear power plant. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday said Kyiv’s forces in Kursk were holding their positions and thanked the troops involved for their service.

    "title": "Trabajadores de Boeing votan por amplia mayoría a favor de una huelga en la región de Seattle",
    "text": "Trabajadores de Boeing votan por amplia mayoría a favor de una huelga en la región de Seattle\nSeattle (Estados Unidos) (AFP) – Los trabajadores de Boeing en la región de Seattle, en el noroeste de Estados Unidos, votaron masivamente a favor de una huelga el viernes y rechazaron el nuevo convenio del gigante de la aviación, que dijo estar \"comprometido\" con las negociaciones en medio de su difícil situación financiera.\nPrimera modificación: Última modificación:\nLa plantilla rechazó el acuerdo con un 94,6% de los votos y aprobó la huelga con un 96%, dijo Jon Holden, presidente del sindicato International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Distrito 751.\n\"Nuestros miembros han hablado claro esta noche\", dijo el dirigente de este sindicato que representa a más de 30.000 trabajadores del fabricante aeronáutico en esta región.\n\"Haremos huelga a medianoche\", afirmó.\n\"Seguimos comprometidos\"\nLa protesta afectará a dos grandes plantas de montaje en la región del estrecho de Puget y paralizará la producción de los aviones 737, 777 y 767, cuyas entregas ya están retrasadas.\nEsto supone un problema añadido, pues el fabricante de aviones cobra la mayor parte del pago (alrededor del 60%) una vez entregados los aparatos.\nPese a la abrumadora votación a favor de la huelga, el grupo Boeing dijo en un comunicado que está \"comprometido\" con las negociaciones.\n\"Seguimos comprometidos con restablecer nuestra relación con nuestros empleados y el sindicato, y estamos listos para volver a la mesa de negociaciones para llegar a un nuevo acuerdo\", dijo la compañía.\nSegún los analistas aeronáuticos de de TD Cowen, una huelga de 50 días privaría a Boeing de entre 3.000 y 3.500 millones de dólares de liquidez y tendría un impacto de 5.500 millones de dólares en los ingresos.\nLa plantilla se opuso al acuerdo preliminar alcanzado entre la dirección de Boeing y los líderes sindicales de la empresa que preveía un aumento salarial del 25% a lo largo de cuatro años y un compromiso de inversión en esta región.\nTambién preveía la construcción del próximo avión, anunciado para 2035, en el área de Seattle, cuna histórica del fabricante, que debía asegurar los empleos para las próximas décadas.\nUn aumento \"engañoso\"\nSin embargo, los trabajadores consideraron que el acuerdo no era tan generoso como se pretendía y señalaron, por ejemplo, que el aumento del 25% era engañoso porque al mismo tiempo se eliminaba un bono anual que daba la compañía.\n\"Están hablando de un aumento del 25% y no es así\", dijo Paul Janousek, un electricista de la planta de Everett que votó a favor de la huelga después de concluir que el giro de Boeing fue \"engañoso\".\nJanousek, de 55 años y en Boeing desde hace 13 años, calcula que su aumento es solo de alrededor del 9% si se elimina el bono anual.\nEl paro ocurre en un contexto delicado para Boeing, cuya reputación se ha visto empañada por distintos incidentes de seguridad aérea.\nEl fabricante esperaba que sus concesiones fueran suficientes para evitar la huelga, en medio de su situación económica precaria tras los accidentes de sendos 737 MAX 8 en 2018 y 2019, que se cobraron la vida de 346 personas, y por multitud de problemas de calidad de producción.\n\"No es ningún secreto que nuestro negocio está pasando por un momento difícil, en parte debido a nuestros propios errores en el pasado. (...) Una huelga pondría en peligro nuestra recuperación\", advirtió el miércoles por la noche Kelly Ortberg, quien asumió las riendas de la compañía en agosto.\nEl directivo, que una semana después de asumir se comprometió a \"reiniciar\" las relaciones con el sindicato IAM, instó a los empleados a no \"sacrificar\" el progreso futuro por \"frustraciones vinculadas al pasado\".\nLa huelga se enmarca en un contexto de creciente conflictividad laboral en Estados Unidos, que ha tenido protestas similares en el sector automovilístico, el entretenimiento y otras industrias.\n© 2024 AFP",
