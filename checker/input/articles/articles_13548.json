    "text": "Elon Musk and RFK Jr. Clash Over America's Obesity Approach\n[Henry Turner](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79353)Updated: 12-19-2024 07:14 PM\nThe Obesity Epidemic in America\nThe ongoing debate over how to combat America's staggering obesity epidemic affects 40% of adults and nearly 20% of children. This issue has sparked various opinions from influential figures within Donald J. Trump's circle, potentially reshaping public health policies in the U.S.\nContrasting Solutions from Influential Figures\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been selected as a potential candidate for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, emphasizes the necessity of lifestyle changes as a significant element of the solution. He advocates for a comprehensive approach focusing on nutritious eating and regular physical activity, aiming to guide Americans towards healthier living.\nElon Musk's Advocacy for Medicinal Solutions\nOn the other hand, Elon Musk, a prominent tech entrepreneur and close adviser to Trump, advocates for easier access to medication aimed at weight loss. He has publicly supported the use of drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, produced by Novo Nordisk A/S. Musk claims that these medications are crucial for addressing obesity effectively, stating that they could greatly enhance the overall health and quality of life for many Americans.\nKennedy's Criticism of Drug Companies\nKennedy has expressed concerns regarding the motives of pharmaceutical companies that produce obesity medications, suggesting that they may rely on the public's reliance on drugs rather than promoting essential lifestyle changes. During an interview with Fox News, he conveyed skepticism about the reliance on medication for obesity management.\nThe Concern Over Drug Safety\nIn a notable discussion, Kennedy mentioned that the European Union is investigating Ozempic due to potential links to suicidal thoughts. However, he overlooks that regulatory bodies have concluded that there's no conclusive evidence to support these claims. Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, criticized Kennedy for making unfounded assertions, asserting that such misinformation can be detrimental to public health.\nPath to Solutions: Lifestyle vs. Pharmaceuticals\nThe contrasting viewpoints of Musk and Kennedy reflect the deeper complexities of addressing America's severe obesity crisis. While some argue for the importance of significant lifestyle changes, others believe that pharmaceuticals can provide immediate and effective solutions.\nExploring Alternative Treatments\nAmidst this debate, the possibility of using cannabis as an alternative treatment for obesity is gaining attention. Recent studies indicate that cannabis could play a supportive role in obesity treatment by helping to reduce specific health measurements, although this idea remains controversial in the broader healthcare discussion.\nConclusion\nAs the discourse continues, it is essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of both recommended approaches. Whether lifestyle modifications or pharmaceutical solutions take precedence in tackling the obesity epidemic remains a topic of heated debate. The outcome of this discussion could significantly influence public health strategies in the future.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the current obesity rate in America?\nThe obesity epidemic affects about 40% of adults and nearly 20% of children in America.\nWhat are the key points of Kennedy's approach to obesity?\nKennedy advocates for lifestyle changes focusing on nutrition and exercise as vital components in managing obesity.\nHow does Elon Musk view weight-loss medications?\nMusk supports easing access to weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, believing they are crucial for public health.\nWhat concerns did Kennedy raise about Ozempic?\nKennedy mentioned an ongoing investigation in the EU regarding potential suicidal ideation linked to Ozempic, although regulatory conclusions disagree with this assertion.\nAre there alternative treatments being considered for obesity?\nRecent studies suggest that cannabis may have potential as an adjunct treatment in obesity care by reducing relevant health measurements.\nAbout Investors Hangout\n[Investors Hangout](https://investorshangout.com/) is a leading online stock forum for financial discussion and learning, offering a wide range of free tools and resources.

    "text": "The Alabama State Legislature recognized former Blount High School head football coach Ben Harris on Tuesday afternoon at its general session.\nState Representative Napoleon Bracy of Mobile introduced a proclamation congratulating Harris for being selected for induction into the National High School Football Hall of Fame. He will be inducted June 14, 2025, at Canton, Ohio.\nHarris was joined by his wife and daughter and AHSAA Associate Executive Director Brian McRae, as well as the entire legislative members from the Mobile area at the ceremony Tuesday.\n“I am so grateful,” Harris said in his address to the Legislature. “I have been very blessed.”\nHarris, who was inducted into the Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame in 2013, was recognized in a proclamation compiled jointly by State Legislature’s House and Senate.\nHarris attended Toulminville High School in Mobile where he was an outstanding quarterback and an All-Star basketball player. He then attended Alabama State University where he became one of the most prolific quarterbacks in Hornets history.\nHe took over in 1988 as head football coach at Mattie T. Blount High School in Prichard, a team that had gone 33-61-1 from 1978-1987 in the 10 years before he arrived.\nHarris’ teams won four Class 5A state championships (1990, 1992, 1996, 1997) over the next 10 seasons compiling 100-30 record during that stretch and produced some of the state’s legendary stars – among them the AHSAA’s first single-season 3,000-yard rusher Sherman Williams (Alabama); defensive lineman DeMarco McNeil (Auburn), who as the first true lineman to earn the Alabama Sportswriters Association Mr. Football Award in 1998; outstanding SEC quarterback Dameyune Craig (Auburn); and wide receiver Deandre Green (Auburn), named the AHSAA’s Class 5A Back of the Year in 1998.\n“I’m so excited that he is finally getting the recognition he deserved,” Craig told AL.com in February. “Coach Harris did more with less, and it was done coaching with love. He went to three straight state championships and won two from 1990-1992 and had a grand total of two Division 1 signees. He is the greatest to ever do it.”\nHarris was named Alabama High School Coach of the Year twice by the news media and earned the AHSAA 5A Coach of the Year four times. He was head coach of the Alabama team in the Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Football Game in 1991 and an assistant in 1997. He also received the NFL High School Coach of the Year Award in 1997.\nAfter a two-year break, Harris returned to coach at Daleville High School for two seasons and six more seasons at Blount before health issues forced him to finally retire. He has been honored as Citizen of the Year awards three times for civic and religious activities and was inducted into the Baldwin County High School Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Alabama State University Hall of Fame in 2024.\nHarris, who is still Blount High School’s all-time career football coaching wins leader, went on to win 135 games in 19 years as a high school head coach, most of which came in two stints with Blount.\nHarris is being inducted into the National High School Football Hall of Fame’s third class. Also selected is another AHSAA standout from Mobile County, Hanford Dixon. The 1974 Theodore High School graduate went on to earn All-America honors as a defensive back at Southern Mississippi.\nDrafted in the first round of the 1980 draft by the Cleveland Browns, he earned All-Pro honors during his NFL career with the Browns – which spanned from 1981-1989. He finished with 26 interceptions and 440 tackles in 131 games. Dixon was inducted into the Southern Miss Hall of Fame (1980) and Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.\nJoining Harris and Dixon in the Class of 2025 are other football legends: running back Ken Hall of Sugarland (TX) High School; quarterback Tim Couch of Leslie County High School (KY); quarterback Warren Moon of Alexander Hamilton High School (CA); Olympic legend Jim Thorpe, Carlisle Indian Industrial School (PA); and quarterback Michael Vick, Warwick High School (VA). A total of 38 players and coaches are being inducted.\n-- From the AHSAA\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
