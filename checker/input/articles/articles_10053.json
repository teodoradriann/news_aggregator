    "text": "Costi ormai diventati proibitivi in alta stagione e costi dei voli particolarmente rincarati. Da qui ne deriva un calo delle prenotazioni nei periodi di Natale e Capodanno. Questa la testimonianza che emerge dagli operatori delle agenzie viaggi di Lodi. Gli addetti ai lavori riferiscono anche come, dopo la pandemia da Covid, si è registrato un sensibile aumento dei prezzi di viaggio, a volte addirittura \"ingiustificati\". \"Ci sono – afferma Ernestina Abbà, dell’agenzia Ravenala Viaggi, in corso Archinti – molte meno prenotazioni rispetto al periodo festivo dell’anno scorso, si fanno anche meno giorni di vacanze, visto che anche i prezzi degli hotel non sono bassi. Normalmente in questo periodo si cerca di raggiungere mete al caldo, ma per varie motivazioni, come ad esempio la guerra in Medio Oriente e la situazione geopolitica, luoghi come l’Egitto non vengono più richiesti. Per i voli credo che per un bel po’ prezzi come quelli precedenti al 2020 non li vedremo più: tratte a 18 euro erano prezzi “finti”, ciò non giustifica però neppure aumenti di 10 volte. Ed è così anche per chi si rivolge a noi che, in qualità di operatori di viaggio, possiamo beneficiare di qualche sconto particolare con i voli. Questo oggi comunque non basta\". \"È aumentato d’altro canto – aggiunge – l’interesse per i posti freddi, come l’Islanda con i viaggi per cercare di vedere l’aurora. E visto che la vita in questi Paesi è più costosa si sceglie di diminuire i giorni di permanenza. Molte persone venute da noi nelle ultime settimane hanno così preferito prenotate viaggi fuori stagione, magari nel periodo di inizio scuola o direttamente a febbraio\".\nMarco Piccenoni da Bluvacanze, tour operator in corso Roma, concorda su come \"le vacanze invernali siano diventate qualcosa che non ci si può più permettere\". \"Noi – spiega – rispetto all’anno scorso notiamo solo un leggero calo. Quello che sta cambiando molto è l’abitudine di fare viaggi diversi, non c’è più il vincolo della settimana o dei 14 giorni, anzi questo periodo così lungo non lo fa più quasi nessuno. Oggi si cercano 4 o 5, notti a seconda delle esigenze. Per le mete con noi c’è stato un interesse per il caldo soprattutto dell’Oriente, come le Maldive che vanno sempre, ma anche la Thailandia riscuote interesse\".",

    "text": "Students at Laurel High School are getting creative with their Christmas toilet fundraiser to attend a leadership conference next year. The Family Career Community Leaders of America club is raising funds by moving a decorated toilet from yard to yard, with a portion of proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nLAUREL, Mont. – Students at Laurel High School are embracing the holiday spirit in a unique way to fund their trip to a leadership conference next year.\nMembers of the Family Career Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) club are hosting a Christmas toilet fundraiser for the second consecutive year. The club, which focuses on leadership skills and family values, is raising money to attend a state leadership conference in March.\nJennifer Painter, the club advisor, emphasized the importance of family and community support. \"In this day and age family has lost its way so if we have students at an early age the family is where your support lies and after that, that's where community support comes in. I feel that's where family, career, and community all go hand in hand,\" she said.\nClub members Kat Campbell, Raylea Brown, and Bryce Leonhardt explained the creative fundraiser. \"It's a toilet that our advisor got, don't worry it is clean and it's new, we just decorated it for Christmas. The first person that gets it in their yard, can either pay $10 for us to remove it and put it in someone else's yard that we choose, or they can pay $20 and you get to choose which house it goes to next. The more times we move it, the more money we get, and as a group we also decided that 10% of the money we make will be donated to the 'Make-A-Wish Foundation,'\" they said.\nLast year, the students raised approximately $400 and hope to surpass that amount this year. Painter expressed her hopes for community support, stating, \"Donating to this club helps future generations and it really gives those kids skills that they need further down the road in life.\"\nFor those interested in participating or displaying the FCCLA Christmas toilet in their yard, Painter can be contacted via email (Jennifer_painter@laurel.k12.mt.us).\nThis fundraiser not only supports the students' educational goals but also contributes to a charitable cause, making it a community effort during the festive season.\nMore from this section New Historical Fiction Novel Delves Into the Brutality of Impressment in 18th and 19th Century England Celebrities and coastal residents flee from wind-driven wildfire in Malibu Deer shot & left to waste in Blaine County after general season ends, authorities seek info",

    "title": "Illinois Supreme Court rejects GOP challenge to legislative maps",
    "text": "The Democrat-led Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday said Republicans waited too long to contest the 2021 redrawing of legislative districts that has maintained Democratic majorities in the state House and Senate.\nRepublicans had argued the Democratic mapping effort was unconstitutional political gerrymandering that limited voters’ choices. But the court’s five-member Democratic majority said the GOP’s “timing in filing the instant motion shows a lack of due diligence.”\n“Plaintiffs could have brought their argument years ago,” the majority wrote in an unsigned decision. “Their claim that waiting multiple election cycles is necessary to reveal the effects of redistricting is unpersuasive.”\nOf the court’s two Republicans, Justice David Overstreet dissented from the majority and Justice Lisa Holder White took no part in the case.\nAt issue was a Jan. 28 Republican challenge to the redrawing of legislative districts by Democrats who control the General Assembly that occurred following the 2020 federal census.\nLed by House Republican leader Tony McCombie of Savanna, the GOP contended the political gerrymandering of maps violated a state constitutional requirement that districts be “compact” and that elections be “free and equal.” In making the argument, the GOP said the boundaries limited voter choice.\nIn their lawsuit, Republicans contended that under a 1981 standard adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court involving a single district’s boundaries, 52 of the 118 Illinois House district boundaries violate being constitutionally compact.\nThe 2021 legislative redistricting map, used in elections in 2022 and last November, has resulted in Democrats gaining and maintaining a 78-40 supermajority over Republicans in the state House and a 40-19 advantage in the state Senate.\nHouse Republicans had sought to use the results of those two elections to bolster their case, citing as guidance a U.S. Supreme Court decision on redistricting. But the state’s high court majority said the decision to wait more than three years after the maps were signed into law by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker failed to recognize “the expeditious filing and disposition of every previous redistricting case considered by this court since the adoption of the 1970 (Illinois) Constitution.”\nIn reaching their finding, the court majority did not address the House Republicans’ gerrymandering claims. Instead, in allowing Democratic legislative leaders House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and Senate President Don Harmon to intervene in the case, majority justices accepted their argument and introduced the legal timeliness doctrine of “laches” to redistricting challenges — though the state constitution contains no specific time limit for filing such an action.\nGenerally, under the “laches” doctrine, the majority of justices said Republicans knew or should have known of their claim but unjustifiably delayed asserting it, and that the delay would negatively hurt the Democratic defendants.\nRepublicans’ “approach would also be prejudicial and create uncertainty for voters and officeholders alike, now and in the future, as to whether any redistricting plan in Illinois is ever final,” the court majority wrote. “We are now closer to the next decennial census than the last.”\nUnder a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the issue of partisan political gerrymandering is not subject to federal court review and is left to the states. Under the state Constitution, the Illinois Supreme Court has sole jurisdiction over redistricting cases.\nHouse Republicans assailed the ruling as political “dirty work” by Democratic justices to uphold Democrats’ legislative power and vowed to seek ethical reforms for the state’s highest court.\n“Never has a greater injustice been foisted on the voters of Illinois through a judicial decision than it was today. Two hundred seven years of our state’s history and this has to be the absolute worst,” said state Rep. Dan Ugaste of St. Charles, a member of the House GOP leadership.\n“They had the chance to make this right, just to give the voters a chance to pick their representatives instead of representatives picking their voters, and they declined. And why did they decline? Because of a technical term in the law that I believe was completely misapplied,” he said. “Someone has to be called to account on this.”\nIn his dissent, Overstreet noted the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that political gerrymandering was not justiciable in the federal courts. He said that while the state’s highest court in the past has indicated ‘“political fairness’ is an Illinois constitutional requirement for redistricting plans, it has yet to provide standards and guidance” for what that entails and how it should be enforced.\nOverstreet also disagreed with applying the “laches” timeliness standard to the case.\nChicago Tribune’s Jeremy Gorner contributed.",

    "title": "New Manga, Anime Petition Asks Legislatures to Censor Shota, Loli Content",
    "text": "New Manga, Anime Petition Asks Legislatures to Censor Shota, Loli Content The 213th Diet is being asked to further criminalize content that exploits minors including anime, manga. In the world of anime and manga, there is something for every one. Whether we are talking romance or action, the industries cover a ton of genres. Of course, there are types of anime and manga more controversial than others. One of the most contested tropes boils down to loli and shota content. Now, a politician in Japan wants the legislature to reexamine the trope and implement censorship on it. The confession comes from [Japan as the 213th Diet session features](https://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_seigan.nsf/html/seigan/2131422.htm) a petition by Masako Okawara. The politician is asking for stricter regulation on any content – including anime and manga – that exploits children. This is why the use of loli and shota content is on the docket as the tropes are long controversial. For those unaware, loli and shota refer to type of project that focuses on children or adults who look like children. Oftentimes, loli and shota content sexualizes its young stars, and this has long been a controversial issue with anime fans. As you can imagine, different cultures feel differently about the genre, but the global consensus on loli and shota is fraught. As such, Okawara is eager to adjust the law in Japan to better censor content that exploits minors such as loli and shota. \"The neglect of the sexual commodification of children through their images perpetuates harmful values in society and gravely infringes on children's rights to live and grow up safely and securely,\" she shared in a recent statement to constituents. \"The unchecked sexualization of children in media perpetuates damaging societal norms and poses a serious threat to children's safety and well-being.\" While Japan does have laws regarding child exploitation and pornography, they are not without fault. In 2019, a committee at the United Nations asked Japan to further criminalize the \"production, distribution, provision, sale, access, viewing and possession of images and depictions of children, or persons who primarily appear to be children, engaging in explicit sexual acts, or depictions of sexual parts of a child's body for sexual purposes\". It seems Okawara is taking this request to heart, and she is petitioning the 213th Diet to look over the issue. What do you make of this latest legislative report?

    "title": "'American Pickers' Star Mike Wolfe Locks Lips With Girlfriend Leticia Cline During Memphis Trip",
    "text": "American Pickers star Mike Wolfe posted a photo of himself kissing his girlfriend Leticia Cline on Instagram this week , and fans are swooning. The couple sat at an upright piano together, and it looked like Wolfe was the one playing before he got distracted. For those catching up, here's what we know about their burgeoning relationship.\nWolfe has been a staple of unscripted TV for a decade and a half now thanks to American Pickers , which is now in its 25th season. Unlike other reality shows, this one rarely delves into its stars' personal lives, so fans may not realize that Wolfe went through a divorce in 2020. According to a report by The Sun , Wolfe and Cline had become friends in 2018, and sometime in 2021 they began dating.\n(Photo: Instagram / Mike Wolfe) Cline is 45 years old and has an eclectic background in her career, education and interests. She was born in Cave City, Kentucky and began modeling at age 14, with photos in various magazines. She studies psychology and finance at the University of Kentucky and became a certified public accountant (CPA). At the same time, she pursued hobbies that are more in line with Wolfe's lifestyle.\nCline's website says: \"Currently I'm a journalist, motorcycle racer, Heritage Tourism Preservationist, owner of a Wolfdog named Jack London, and mother to a human named Caleb.\" She has had a hand in several businesses, particularly in her hometown. She co-founded Standard Motorcycle Corporation in 2014, owns a community motorcycle garage, and helps run a bar called The Dive with her sister and mother. She also co-founded the food and drink company SuckerPunch, and just last month she opened a coffee shop called Ace Coffee Cafe in Cave City.\nAmazingly, Cline also found the time to work as a councilwoman for Cave City in the past. To this day, she helps host and coordinate various events for the betterment of the community, all while keeping up with Wolfe on his globe-trotting, treasure-hunting adventures. Wolfe is still working on American Pickers with Danielle Colby and a rotating cast of guest co-hosts. So far, Cline has not been one of them.\n0 comments Related:\n'American Pickers' Accused of Faking Scene 'American Pickers': Rob Wolfe Snaps Back at Frank Fritz Supporter Backlash 'American Pickers' Star Weds in Scenic Mountain Ceremony",

    "text": "'Noticeable progress' in Hamas-Israel cease-fire talks\nA delegation of the Palestinian militant group\nHamas was in Cairo on Saturday as Egyptian state media reported “noticeable progress” in cease-fire talks with Israel, though an Israeli official downplayed the prospects for a full end to the war in Gaza.\nPressure has mounted to reach a deal halting\nthe nearly 7-month-long war. A top U.N. official says there is now a full-blown famine in northern Gaza, while Israel insists it will launch an offensive into Rafah, the territory's southernmost city on the border with Egypt, where more than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering.\nEgyptian and U.S. mediators have reported signs of compromise in recent days, but chances for a cease-fire deal remain entangled with the key question of whether Israel will accept an end to the war without reaching its stated goal of destroying Hamas.\nEgypt’s state-owned Al-Qahera News TV channel said Saturday that a consensus had been reached over many disputed points but did not elaborate. Hamas has called for a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza.\nCreate a More Connected Minnesota\nMPR News is your trusted resource for the news you need. With your support, MPR News brings accessible, courageous journalism and authentic conversation to everyone - free of paywalls and barriers. Your gift makes a difference.\nA senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, played down the prospects for a full end to the war. The official said Israel was committed to the Rafah invasion and that it will not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a deal to release hostages.\nThe proposal that Egyptian mediators had put to Hamas sets out a three-stage process that would bring an immediate, six-week cease-fire and partial release of Israeli hostages, and would include some sort of Israeli pullout. The initial stage would last for 40 days. Hamas would start by releasing female civilian hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\nGershon Baskin, director for the Middle East at the International Communities Organization, said it appears that Hamas has agreed to the framework that Egypt proposed and Israel has already accepted. He said if Israel sends its top negotiators to Cairo after the Sabbath ends on Saturday evening, that would signify it’s very serious.\nThe war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s local health officials, caused widespread destruction and plunged the territory into an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.\nThe conflict erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, abducting about 250 people and killing around 1,200, mostly civilians. Israel says militants\nstill hold around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.\nIsraeli strikes early Saturday on Gaza killed at least six people. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble of a building in Rafah and taken to Yousef Al Najjar hospital. A strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed three people, according to hospital officials.\nIn the last 24 hours, the bodies of 32 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Saturday. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies but says that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.\nThe Israeli military says it has killed 13,000 militants, without providing evidence to back up the claim. It has also conducted mass arrests during its raids inside Gaza.\nGaza's Health Ministry urged the International Criminal Court to investigate\nthe death in Israeli custody of a Gaza surgeon. Adnan al-Borsh, 50, was working at al-Awda Hospital when Israeli troops stormed it in December, detaining him and others inside, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Club.\nIn related developments this week,\nIsrael briefed Biden administration officials on plans to evacuate civilians ahead of the Rafah operation, according to U.S. officials familiar with the talks.\nThe United Nations has warned that hundreds of thousands would be “at imminent risk of death” if Israel moves forward into the densely packed city, which is also a critical entry point for humanitarian aid.\nThe director of the U.N. World Food Program, Cindy McCain, said Friday that trapped civilians in the north, the most cut-off part of Gaza, have plunged into famine. McCain said a cease-fire and a greatly increased flow of aid through land and sea routes was essential.\nIsrael recently opened new crossings for aid into northern Gaza, but on Wednesday, Israeli settlers blocked the first convoy before it crossed into the besieged enclave. Once inside Gaza, the convoy was commandeered by Hamas militants, before U.N. officials reclaimed it.",
