    "text": "This is the sickening moment a killer was caught on video casually buying snacks after murdering a 26-year-old man by spraying him in the face with ammonia. Andrew Foster was attacked when he answered the door in August 2023 as part of an organised hit. Just moments after carrying out the horrific attack, John Wandless was captured on CCTV at a garage smiling at the person serving him and even debating what kind of milkshake to buy with his accomplice, Kenneth Fawcett. They had stopped off in a stolen VW Golf which they used to carry out the attack, which was later burnt in an attempt to conceal evidence. The horrific incident was just one of a series of attacks in Gateshead and South Tyneside, one of which caused a victim to lose an eye. Newcastle Crown Court heard that there were four corrosive substance attacks in the space of 11 days, connected with drug dealing. Youssef Wynne was a drug dealer and John Wandless, Kenneth Fawcett and Josh Hawthorn worked for him, the court heard. Wandless can be seen at a petrol station, speaking to a cashier, just moments after the brutal attack At one point, he turned to his accomplice, Fawcett, to debate about what kind of milkshake to buy The killer seemed calm and relaxed. At one point he could be seen smiling and seemingly without any cares The VW was also stolen and was later burnt in an attempt to hide evidence. They casually used to service station while, Andrew Foster was fighting for his life Fawcett was described as Wynne&#039;s &#039;enforcer&#039; and was physically present at the attacks. He recruited Wandless, who was at the last three attacks. The prosecution said the group were involved in a scheme to &#039;tax&#039; other drug dealers by stealing from them and trying to scare them off. The quartet were found guilty today of all counts they were charged with, including murdering and robbing Mr Foster at his home in Wrekenton. During the trial, Mark McKone KC, prosecuting, told jurors: &#039;On the night of the 20th of August last year, Andrew Foster was at home with his partner when two men entered his home and attacked him by throwing a chemical in his face. &#039;As a result, he couldn&#039;t breathe. He suffered a severe respiratory attack, he had a heart attack and died. &#039;The chemical attack upon Mr Foster was the fourth similar chemical attack in that general area in just 11 days, between 9th and 20th of August. &#039;The prosecution say that four separate victims were attacked at their homes in the Gateshead or South Shields areas by ammonia, or a similar corrosive liquid, being thrown or sprayed into their faces. &#039;Andrew Foster died, one woman lost an eye and two other men needed medical treatment. &#039;The prosecution say that the violence was connected to drug dealing. &#039;The prosecution say that the four defendants were part of a scheme to tax other drug dealers. &#039;Taxing is a slang word in the drugs world for dealers stealing drugs from another dealer and, at the same time, scaring off the competition from future drug dealing.&#039; The prosecution did not say that Wynne and Hawthorn were present at any of the four attacks. But Mr McKone added: &#039;The prosecution do say that Wynne was involved in organising all the attacks and that Hawthorn was also involved in organising the fourth and fatal attack. &#039;The attacks were carried out, we submit, for the benefit of Wynne and Hawthorn.&#039; Mr McKone added: &#039;The prosecution submit that anyone attacking someone in the face with ammonia must intend to cause at least really serious harm. &#039;Those using ammonia to attack others will have seen the suffering of the victim on the earlier occasions. &#039;The prosecution say that all four defendants were part of a joint enterprise. Andrew Foster (pictured) was attacked when he answered the door in August 2023 as part of an organised hit Pictured top left, Youssef Wynne, top right, John George Wandless, bottom left, Josh Craig Hawthorn and bottom right, Kenneth Fawcett &#039;The defendants formed a joint plan for Fawcett and Wandless to drive to the victim&#039;s home at Eighton Terrace, Wrekenton, in Gateshead in order to attack him with ammonia.&#039; Mr Foster&#039;s partner, Katie Harrison, came downstairs during the attack after hearing a commotion to find him shouting, &#039;It&#039;s ammonia, I can&#039;t breathe&#039;. The jury saw footage of a police interview with Ms Harrison which took place days after her boyfriend&#039;s death. She explained that she had gone to bed when there was a knock at the door. Seconds later, Mr Foster screamed to call an ambulance. She later realised a box was missing from the kitchen, which contained a kit for making sweets which were then sprayed with cannabis oil. She said: &#039;He was screaming and he grabbed his face, his eyes were all red and swollen. He said it&#039;s ammonia, I can&#039;t breathe, I can&#039;t breathe.&#039; Mr McKone added: &#039;The ammonia caused Andrew Foster to have breathing difficulties and a cardiac arrest which led to brain damage as oxygen could not get to his brain. He died in hospital the following day.&#039; A doctor said that the ammonia triggered an asthma attack which caused cardiac arrest which also caused a hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. According to the doctor, this meant there is a direct link between the ammonia attack and death. One of the group&#039;s attack victims, Nicola Dixon, gave evidence in the trial. Police cordon off the property following the attack on Monday, August 22, 2023 Andrew Foster was attacked at his property (pictured) as part of a &#039;taxing&#039; scheme organised by the gang The horrific incident was just one of a series of attacks in Gateshead and South Tyneside. Pictured, a police cordon after the fatal ammonia attack Speaking anonymously via video link, she said she was at home with her boyfriend in Jarrow, on South Tyneside, on August 16, 2023. He was recovering from surgery for a broken leg and was in a plaster when two men appeared at the sitting room door. One of them was carrying a hammer which he &#039;swung&#039; at the victim&#039;s boyfriend. Ms Dixon said she jumped up and grabbed the hammer when suddenly, something was squirted in her face. &#039;We were struggling and then the next thing he squirted something in my face,&#039; she told the court, &#039;It hit my lungs. I didn&#039;t know what it was but it hit my eyes.&#039; She broke down as she explained how she was instantly blinded in one eye and passed out. Although she underwent three operations to save her eye, they failed and her left eye had to be removed a few months later. The four killers were convicted at Newcastle Crown Court of murder and robbery relating to the stealing of cannabis edibles after Mr Foster was attacked with ammonia at his home in Gateshead. Wynne was also convicted of assaulting Mr Foster 11 months before he died in an alleged dispute over drugs. Wynne, Fawcett and Wandless were also convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Nicola Dixon on August 16 last year. Wynne, Fawcett and Wandless were also convicted of of attempting to cause GBH with intent on another man at his house in Hebburn on August 12 last year. The man was sprayed in the face with ammonia and required hospital treatment. Wandless pleaded to handling a stolen VW Golf and arson by burning it out after it was allegedly used in three of the incidents. Wynne, 39, of Wuppertal Court, Jarrow, Wandless, 33, of no fixed address, Fawcett, 33, of Balkwell Avenue, North Shields and Hawthorn, 22, of Ashfield, Jarrow, were further remanded in custody and will be sentenced on July 26. The violent thugs face mandatory life sentences for murder. Speaking after the trial, Andrew Foster&#039;s mother Karen said his family will never get over his death. She said: &#039;We as a family will never get over Andrew&#039;s death. &#039;To those who didn&#039;t know Andrew, he was a practical joker, always laughing and had a heart of gold. &#039;I spoke to him every day, usually on video calls when he would pull funny faces just to make me laugh. He cared for his family and friends so much. &#039;Andrew was our only son, as well as a loving and supportive partner, grandson, nephew and cousin. &#039;He was particularly close to his Grandad who was very special to him.&#039; Speaking following the convictions, Detective Inspector Tam Fowler, of Northumbria Police, said: &#039;Our thoughts are firmly with Andrew&#039;s loved ones following his tragic death as well as the victims of everyone who was involved in this reckless spate of attacks. &#039;This was a shocking crime spree which saw the offenders act together, intimidating and causing serious harm to their intended targets. &#039;Not only did their cowardly actions lead to a young man losing his life, they also led to life-changing injuries to another woman. &#039;The defendants have also continued to deny the charges put to them without showing a hint of remorse. &#039;That meant Andrew&#039;s family and the survivors of the other attacks have had to endure a lengthy court process and subsequent trial. &#039;Of course, no result will ever take away the pain that their actions have caused, but I hope these guilty verdicts today give some comfort to knowing that those behind the attacks have been brought to justice.&#039;",

    "text": "MIAMI – It took Michael Wilson a little more than 17 hours to travel to Miami from his home state of Arkansas.\n“I was tired of the life I was living, and I knew I had to get away from everyone I knew,” he said. “So, I decided to come down to Florida.”\nLeer en español.\nBut his road to physical and emotional wellbeing took much longer than that.\n“I had such horrible depression where I tried killing myself more than once, and that’s all I thought about for so long until I came here,” Wilson said.\nThe “here” he was referring to is The Caring Place at the Miami Rescue Mission.\nAn unexpected encounter with a stranger in a food line one year ago led the 32-year-old Wilson to walk through their doors and find the nourishment he so desperately needed.\n“I’m in such a better place now, and it all started because someone told me I could come here and get some food,” he said.\nLian Navarro, the Assistant Director of Community Development at The Caring Place, said the facility is a “365-day operation.”\nShe told Local 10 News that, like Wilson, most men there find that hope begins with a meal.\n“Over 1,200 meals are served at all of our centers in Miami and Broward County,” she said.\nDuring the fall season, that number rises significantly. The Caring Place serves 250,000 plates of food.\n“These are the combination of homeless individuals and also families that come in that have food insecurity,” Navarro said.\n“When you finally get something to eat, you’re relaxed,” said Wilson. “You’re able to think better. You’re actually able to focus on something you need to do to better yourself.”\nBetter himself and others.\nWilson recently graduated from the organization’s regeneration program.\nHe’s also helping men at the education center develop skills to enter the workforce.\nWith his treasured brown cowboy boots on, Wilson is now walking with confidence, gratitude, and a healthy outlook for the journey ahead.\n“What I am going to do is go to college,” he said. “I am going to get a degree in a field where I can help other people who are trying to get out of drug addiction or trying to get out of a bad position in life that they don’t see any help. This place will always have a place in my heart, because they gave me what I needed to start a new life.”\nMiracles happen every day at The Caring Place, and the nonprofit hopes Local 10′s Day of Giving on Friday is no different.\nWith a donation of just $2.70, The Caring Place can provide one Thanksgiving meal, and with your support, they can feed thousands during the holidays.\nThe Caring Place will be at the Publix in Hollywood, located at 1700 Sheridan Street, as will Local 10′s Calvin Hughes and Nicole Perez, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Alerta científica, caída abrupta en los niveles globales de agua dulce",
    "text": "Entre mayo de 2014 y marzo de 2016, los niveles globales de almacenamiento de agua terrestre, experimentaron una caída abrupta, una de las más significativas registradas desde el inicio de las observaciones satelitales. Este fenómeno, documentado por las misiones GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) y su sucesora GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), de la NASA, dejó huellas profundas en el balance hídrico de la Tierra y plantea interrogantes cruciales sobre su recuperación en el contexto del cambio climático.\nLa disminución media del líquido vital, durante este período alcanzó aproximadamente 22 mm en términos de altura de agua equivalente, lo que equivale a millones de litros de agua faltantes.\nSegún análisis basados en modelos bayesianos, este descenso representa un cambio estructural estadísticamente significativo en la serie temporal del almacenamiento global de agua terrestre, con una probabilidad superior al 99.9%. El epicentro de esta crisis fue el noreste de América del Sur, afectado por una sequía sin precedentes que coincidió con una serie de eventos de El Niño consecutivos, incluidos los de 2015-2016.\nEste fenómeno no fue aislado. Sequías simultáneas en otros continentes, desde África hasta Asia, impidieron que los niveles de TWS se recuperaran incluso años después. Para 2023, el rango superior de TWS global seguía siendo 1 cm más bajo en comparación con los niveles previos a la caída, lo que subraya la persistencia de sus efectos.\nCambio climático y el ciclo hidrológico El calentamiento global emerge como un factor potencial que agrava esta crisis hídrica. Las temperaturas en aumento intensifican la evapotranspiración, reduciendo la disponibilidad de agua en la superficie terrestre. Este secado neto de la tierra también está asociado con una mayor frecuencia e intensidad de eventos de sequía, lo que plantea dudas sobre el equilibrio a largo plazo del ciclo hidrológico global.\nLas observaciones también revelaron una correlación entre la disminución de TWS y un aumento acelerado en el nivel del mar durante el mismo período. La pérdida de agua terrestre contribuyó a este incremento, reflejando la transferencia de masa desde la tierra hacia los océanos. Sin embargo, las estimaciones del nivel del mar han mostrado discrepancias significativas en los últimos años, lo que subraya la complejidad de este fenómeno.\nEl noreste de América del Sur fue una de las regiones más afectadas, con un mínimo histórico de almacenamiento de agua durante la sequía de 2015. Las anomalías de TWS en esta región, monitoreadas a través de GRACE y GRACE-FO, fueron drásticas, evidenciando un estrés hídrico extremo que impactó ecosistemas, comunidades y la agricultura local.\nTe puede interesar: ¿Por qué el agua embotellada es perjudicial para nuestra salud? ¿Es más segura que el agua del grifo? Además, el impacto se extendió más allá de las fronteras sudamericanas. Al menos el 52% de las áreas terrestres no cubiertas de hielo alcanzaron mínimos históricos de TWS entre 2015 y 2023, según los datos analizados. Este porcentaje es significativamente mayor que el promedio histórico y evidencia la magnitud global de la crisis.\nLa recuperación de los niveles de agua dulce enfrenta múltiples desafíos. Mientras que las precipitaciones en algunas regiones han aliviado parcialmente las condiciones, las proyecciones climáticas sugieren que los eventos extremos, como las sequías prolongadas, serán más comunes en el futuro. Esto plantea la necesidad de medidas urgentes para gestionar de manera sostenible los recursos hídricos, especialmente en regiones vulnerables.\nAdemás, las discrepancias en las estimaciones del nivel del mar y su relación con el TWS subrayan la importancia de mejorar los modelos hidrológicos y las capacidades de monitoreo satelital. Entender mejor cómo interactúan el ciclo hidrológico y el clima global será clave para prever y mitigar crisis futuras.\nImagen: n-trash",
