Suddenly, this past week or so, folders inside a fence can't be moved as I need to, usually putting higher priority items at the bottom inside a given fence. Uninstalled and reinstalled yesterday, restarted laptop, still no change. Windows not set to \"Auto Arrange\" , I did enable the regedit to show the 'Lock Fences' feature removed in v5, but that doesn't have any affect. No clue what's happened but hard to use Fences now with this bizarre issue which is multiplied because I have about 12 fences on my desktop - many folders within each. Please advise\nN.B: Just noted that this only happens on one (1) of my 3 monitors, my other two, I can move icons around without issue\nMoved to Fences area\n[basj](/users/281/basj)\nReply #1 Friday, November 15, 2024 8:14 AM\nHello,\nSorry to hear you are having issues. Need to know more on your system and issue.\n- Your Windows10 or 11 full version and OS Build number. Please use Winver.exe.\n- Fences full version number.\n- Is this issue on Desktop Fences or Portal Fences?\n- Does the Icons move as you click and drag and move itself back to its old position or it does not react to your click and drag at all?\n- Did you have recently install a new software or update something that also introduce something onto your desktop area.\nThank you.\nBasj,\nStardock Community Assistant.\nPlease [login](/account/logon) to comment and/or vote for this skin.\nWelcome Guest!

    "text": "( MENAFN - ACCESSWIRE) WASHINGTON, DC / ACCESSWIRE / January 18, 2024 / In a powerful and unprecedented effort, the R.T. Weatherman Foundation has organized meetings in Washington, D.C., between the families of American military veterans who lost their lives in Ukraine and members of the United States Congress. This meeting is part of a broader effort to advocate for continued support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression.\nAndrew Duncan, co-founder of the R.T. Weatherman Foundation, emphasized the importance of this meeting. \"We are beyond honored and privileged to bring our fellow Americans to Washington, D.C. They have sacrificed their health and the families have paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of Ukraine and global democracy. Vladimir Putin is wounding and killing Americans. Putin must leave Ukraine now.\"\nThe event highlights the personal stories and sacrifices of the veterans and their families. It underscores the urgency of the conflict in Ukraine and its impact on American lives. The families, sharing their experiences and the memories of their loved ones, aim to shed light on the real consequences of the war and the importance of continued support from the U.S.\nThe R.T. Weatherman Foundation, known for its commitment to supporting families affected by the conflict in Ukraine, believes this meeting is a crucial step in raising awareness and garnering further support for the cause. The Foundation will hold a press conference on Friday, Jan. 19, to discuss.\nAbout the R.T. Weatherman Foundation:\nThe R.T. Weatherman Foundation is a nonprofit organization that stands in the center of turmoil, taking risks that others cannot. We are the last-mile convener. We uncover the gaps and bring together the skills and resources for precision delivery of lifesaving aid and the safe passage of children and families.\nContact Information\nMeaghan Mobbs\nPresident\n[email protected]\n7034020373\nTori Hill\nDirector of Strategy, Programs, and Outreach\n[email protected]\n407-755-7584\nSOURCE: R.T.
