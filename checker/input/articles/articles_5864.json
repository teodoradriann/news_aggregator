    "text": "Las últimas muertes registradas en España de personas que habían padecido las altas temperaturas en plena ola de calor durante su jornada laboral son algo más que tragedias aisladas. Es la constatación de que el cambio climático ya hace mucho que ha dejado de ser un desafío abstracto para convertirse en una amenaza para la vida. Otros muchos empleados han sido atendidos por presuntos golpes de calor. Cada verano, las temperaturas baten nuevos récords. En Aragón, sin ir más lejos , hemos asistido a un mes de junio en el que se han batido récords históricos de temperaturas . Ante unas condiciones climatológicas adversas, solo cabe ahondar en la capacidad de adaptación. Una necesidad que interpela especialmente a las instituciones y empresas. Las políticas laborales deben estar a la altura. Proteger la salud de quienes trabajan al aire libre es una responsabilidad urgente. Las condiciones en las que operan los profesionales de limpieza, jardinería, reparto o construcción deben ser constantemente revisadas. El marco laboral que podía servir hace una década ha quedado obsoleto por las nuevas características climáticas. Del mismo modo que es probable que el presente tenga fecha de caducidad. Trabajar a pleno sol en las actuales temperaturas -y las que están por venir- es una amenaza directa para la salud. Las empresas deben garantizar condiciones de trabajo dignas y seguras para aquellos empleos más expuestos, del mismo modo que la externalización de servicios públicos no puede ir, en ningún caso, en detrimento de los derechos de los trabajadores. Es imprescindible, por tanto, que los ayuntamientos y las empresas públicas y privadas actualicen sus protocolos de forma realista y con enfoque preventivo. La justicia climática y la justicia laboral son indisociables.\nAdaptar la jornada laboral a las nuevas condiciones climáticas es un acto de cuidado colectivo. Del mismo modo que Zaragoza está ampliando la red de refugios ante las olas de calor, cabe ahondar en los criterios de salud climática de los trabajadores , así como reforzar la cultura preventiva. También la ciudadanía debería responder asumiendo una mayor responsabilidad en el cuidado de las calles. La limpieza no es solo la obligación del empleado encargado de la recogida . Previamente, está la responsabilidad de la ciudadanía.\nLos sindicatos llevan tiempo alertando de que este tipo de fallecimientos requieren más atención y más planes de prevención e inspección . En Aragón escasean, quizá por el férreo marcaje que supone para las empresas y el escaso compromiso que desde lo público se tiene en articular medidas que protejan al ciudadano no solo como contribuyente, sino también cuando trabaja. ¿Cuándo se debe parar? ¿A qué está obligado quién contrata y cuándo puede ejercer ese derecho el contratado? Quizá marcar las reglas y hacerlas cumplir aliviaría la preocupante estadística.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo\nRRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email Copiar URL",

In-plant inventory slightly increased WoW. This week, the operating rate of Xinjiang silicon enterprises remained basically stable. During the week, silicon metal futures prices fell again, with the most-traded contract hitting a low of 10,330 yuan/mt. The prices of futures and spot cargoes were lower than the quotations of silicon enterprises, and market transactions were mainly concentrated in futures and spot cargoes. New orders for silicon enterprises were sluggish, leading to a slight increase in inventory. Silicon metal prices remained at low levels, coupled with a lack of improvement in demand, resulting in insufficient price-driving factors. Some silicon enterprises in Xinjiang showed negative production sentiment.\nThe weekly production of silicon enterprises in north-west China (accounting for 75% of capacity) was 11,045 mt, with a weekly operating rate of 81%. The statistical scope for north-west China includes Qinghai, Ningxia, and Gansu. In January, both production increases and cuts were observed among sample silicon enterprises in this region. The production increases were mainly driven by the commissioning of newly built capacity, and the overall operating rate in the region remained high.\nThe weekly production of silicon enterprises in Yunnan (accounting for 30% of capacity) was 3,195 mt, with a weekly operating rate of 38%, down WoW. In-plant inventory fluctuated slightly. Due to sampling bias, the weekly operating rate in Yunnan appeared relatively high. Some silicon enterprises in Baoshan plan to cut production in the coming days, which is expected to further lower Yunnan's operating rate next week. After the production cuts, only a few silicon enterprises in Yunnan will remain in operation.\nThe weekly production of silicon enterprises in Sichuan (accounting for 32% of capacity) was 0 mt, with a weekly operating rate of 0%, down WoW. Currently, none of the sample silicon enterprises in Sichuan are in operation, and among non-sample enterprises, only one with small hydropower capacity is maintaining production.\n》Click to View the SMM Metal Industry Chain Database",

    "title": "Seven Tasmanian devils find a new home at Bridport facility | The Examiner | Launceston, TAS",
    "text": "Seven male Tasmanian devils were introduced to Bridport this week and the new residents are already making themselves at home. Having previously been based at a research facility in Cressy, the marsupials made the move north to the free-range enclosure. The 22-hectare location is intended to be a stepping stone between the intense captivity experienced at Cressy and the freedom of complete release. A spokesperson from the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE Tas) said the Bridport enclosure provided a more natural environment for the devils to live in and interact with one another. \"It provides an ideal space for breeding, as well as encouraging more wild behaviours like being active mostly at night, building their own dens, locating their own food and being wary of people,\" they said. The initiative comes from the department's Save the Tasmanian Devil Program, which has worked to prevent the species' decline since 2003. It was established in large part to curb the spread of devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), an almost universally-fatal cancer that has decimated populations since developing in the 1980s. The NRE Tas spokesperson said despite ongoing efforts, DFTD is still spreading across Tasmania. \"In the wild, devils are cryptic and nocturnal and live across much of the state even though they have been reduced to very low numbers,\" they said. \"Loss of devils due to road incidents remain of significant concern and the development of a vaccine is a promising long-term solution for the survival of the species.\" Before being released into any free-range enclosures, the devils undergo a health check by a vet to ensure they're clear of any diseases. The seven male Tasmanian devils will have their health monitored during their stay in Bridport, which is expected to last until the end of 2024. The enclosure can facilitate breeding once females are introduced to slow the decline of the endangered species. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (MIT News) — MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson PhD ‘89, whose work has illuminated the relationship between political systems and economic growth, were named winners of the [2024 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2024/press-release/) on Monday, October 14. Political scientist James Robinson of the University of Chicago, with whom they have worked closely, also shares the award. “Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better,” the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences stated in the Nobel citation. “The laureates’ research helps us understand why.” The long-term research collaboration between Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, which extends back for more than two decades, has empirically demonstrated that democracies, which hold to the rule of law and provide individual rights, have spurred greater economic activity over the last 500 years. “I am just amazed and absolutely delighted,” Acemoglu told MIT News this morning, about receiving the Nobel Prize. Separately, Johnson told MIT News he was “surprised and delighted” by the announcement. MIT President Sally Kornbluth congratulated both professors at an Institute press conference this morning, saying that Acemoglu and Johnson “reflect a kind of MIT ideal” in terms of the excellence and rigor of their work and their commitment to collaboration. Their research, Kornbluth added, represents “a very MIT interest in making a positive impact in the real world.”",

It’s a perfect few days to put up Halloween decorations or head to the pumpkin patch.\nIf you want to see fall leaves, take a short drive to the Poconos or parts of the Lehigh Valley, where leaf colors reach moderate to high color.\nHigh pressure is the dominant feature of the region, keeping us dry and unseasonably warm on Saturday and Sunday.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nBalmy for the birds Next week it will look more like November Here’s your seven-day forecast: More from CBS News Balmy for the birds\nThis means great weather for the Eagles game Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field. Kickoff Sunday is at 1:00 PM against the Cleveland Browns and conditions will be in the mid-70s under mostly sunny skies.\nBy Sunday evening, the aforementioned low-pressure system will sweep its associated cold front across the region, bringing a slight chance of a few stray showers across the region into early Monday morning. At this point, it looks like the slight chance of rain will disappear from the region Monday morning for the commute.\nClouds will approach Sunday evening, followed by a cold front from the west. That front could bring some isolated showers and a few thunderstorms Sunday night and Monday morning.\nNext week it will look more like November You’ll need to find the fall coat on Monday as the coldest air so far this season arrives behind the cold front. Highs will struggle to reach the mid to upper 50s on Tuesday.

    "text": "The University of Portsmouth is partnering with Gosport-based ocean sailing team, Gentoo Sailing Team, to help protect our planet's marine ecosystems.\nThe University is supporting James Harayda, Skipper and Team Principal, in his bid to compete as the youngest international sailor in the world's biggest and toughest ocean race, the Vendee Globe, a single-handed (solo) non-stop round the world yacht race.\nThe skipper will be competing in the 2024 edition of the round the world race (with the aim of winning the 2028 race and being the first Briton to do so) which will start and finish in Les Sables-d'Olonne, France. The three-month race, which is known as 'the pinnacle of ocean racing' is scheduled to begin on 10 November.\nUniversity researchers will use his yacht, Gentoo, as a platform to conduct world-leading global marine research to help measure the challenges faced by the world's oceans, such as climate change, pollution and disappearing biodiversity. The partnership will also raise awareness with the general public and within schools internationally.\nThe partnership contributes to the UN Ocean Decade of Science for Sustainable Development led by the UNESCO-IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission) to advance global ocean science, foster sustainable development and protect marine ecosystems through collaborative research and innovation.\nProfessor Pierre Failler, Director of the Centre for Blue Governance at the University of Portsmouth, and Unesco Chair holder in Ocean Governance, said: \"This research is embedded in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Decade of Ocean Science and UNESCO's mission to contribute to the building of a culture of peace, the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, the sciences, culture, communication and information.\"\nCommenting on his own motivation, 26 year old double British Champion, James Harayda said: \"The oceans are not only my racetrack but also the lifeline of our planet's health. It's crucial that we, as a population, begin to take the protection and management of our world's oceans more seriously. I am extremely proud to be using Gentoo Sailing Team as a platform to not only raise awareness and inspire the next generation of ocean advocates, but to collect invaluable data to help inform policy makers and drive positive change to our oceans.\n\"Gentoo is an IMOCA class racing yacht, a Formula One car on the high seas, so to accommodate the equipment and research tasks within my 24/7 working day will be a challenge, but one that I am delighted to take on.\"\nRobert Watherston, Commercial Director, Gentoo Sailing Team, added: \"We race, using the power of nature, in front of millions of fans, fully engaged in the extraordinary exploits of James and Gentoo. This project offers an inspiring example of how elite sport and world leading science combines to inform, challenge and ultimately change opinions. There is a great opportunity, for like minded brands, to join us in making this happen.\"\nProfessor Alex Ford, Deputy Director of the Centre for Blue Governance, said:\" We will conduct world-leading oceanographic research to understand and inform international decision-making to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.\n\"This project is the latest one of several we have been fortunate to work on involving oceanographic races. These provide unique opportunities to sample in global locations and in ways not undertaken before and help us better understand our planet and the impacts we humans have on our environment.\"\nProfessor Ford recently contributed to a University of Portsmouth-led study that highlights the growing trend of combining marine sports and science to protect our oceans. The research showed the power of using the global marine recreation community with the purpose of driving scientific advancements to protect our planet's marine ecosystems.\nDr Sophie Quintin, researcher in ocean governance and security from the Centre for Blue Governance, who has promoted the project since meeting the Gentoo Sailing Team at the start of the Route du Rhum in Saint Malo in 2022, said: \"As an amateur ocean racer who has followed ocean racing for many years, I am really excited to see our university supporting James and look forward to collaborating with other universities involved in conducting research.\n\"As sailors and users of the sea, we can all do more to minimise our impact on the seas and the Vendée Globe race, as well as the IMOCA class world series, are spearheading ocean racing in this regard with the incorporation of sustainability as a core objective. I know James is passionate about making a difference so I hope our students and university, our island-city and county will rally behind him.\n\"From a research standpoint, the partnership is a unique opportunity to explore the role played by sailing and the yachting industry in improving the health of our oceans within a broader global policy framework. It is a chance to raise awareness about the many challenges to biodiversity from pollution to overfishing in areas which are rarely researched and not mentioned enough to improve their management.\"\nTo find out more about Gentoo Sailing Team's racing programme, its sustainability objectives and commercial opportunities, please visit: www.gentoosailingteam.co.uk/sponsorship\nTo follow the race which starts in November 2024 visit: www.vendeeglobe.org/fr/edition-2024",
