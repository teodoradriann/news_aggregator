    "text": "Església\nEl Vaticà suspèn l’agenda del Papa almenys fins diumenge\nSegons fonts del Vaticà, l’audiència jubilar de dissabte ha sigut cancel·lada, així com la missa del jubileu dels diaques de diumenge\nFrancesc ha passat una «nit tranquil·la» i aquest matí s’ha «dedicat a la lectura d’alguns diaris»\nÚltima hora de la salut del papa Francesc, avui en directe: quina malaltia té i evolució a l’hospital\nEl Papa pateix un quadre clínic «complex» i estarà hospitalitzat «el temps adequat»\nDesprés de passar una nit «tranquil·la», el Vaticà ha informat aquest matí que el papa Francesc, de 88 anys, ha suspès la seva agenda d’activitats fins com amínim diumenge a causa de la infecció respiratòria per la qual divendres passat va ser hospitalitzat.\nD’aquesta manera, l’audiència jubilar de dissabte ha sigut cancel·lada. I, en el mateix sentit, la missa del jubileu dels diaques, que se celebrarà diumenge, ha sigut delegada al cardenal italià Rino Fisichella, proprefecte del Dicasteri per a l’Evangelització.\nNotícies relacionadesFora d’això, el portaveu vaticà ha explicat aquest dimarts a les 12.30 hores que, en la mateixa línia que els dies anteriors, el Papa ha descansat durant la nit, ha esmorzat i s’ha «dedicat a la lectura d’alguns diaris». A la tarda hi haurà un nou comunicat mèdic.\nQuadre clínic complex\nEl Papa ha imposat un gran hermetisme al voltant de la seva hospitalització. Amb prou feines se sap que el Pontífex, que en els últims dies havia passat una grip, pateix una infecció respiratòria «polibacteriana» que l’ha obligat a canviar de medicació dues vegades en els últims dies. En els informes de dilluns, també es va informar que no té febre, tot i que el quadre clínic és «complex».",
