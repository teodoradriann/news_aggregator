    "text": "La Roma partecipa all'inaugurazione del centro sportivo intitolato a Carlo Mazzone\nIl 19 marzo, giorno dell’ottantottesimo anniversario della nascita di Carlo Mazzone, è stato inaugurato a Roma, nel quartiere Bravetta, un impianto intitolato all’indimenticabile allenatore romano e romanista che guidò i giallorossi dal 1993 al 1996 sotto la Presidenza di Franco Sensi e che mosse i primi passi da calciatore proprio sul terreno che ospita il nuovo campo.\nIl recupero del centro di Via dei Capasso, di proprietà comunale, è stato disposto dal Municipio XII che ne ha affidato la gestione per il primo anno – tramite un bando ponte – alla gloriosa società dell’Alba Roma 1907, erede del sodalizio che partecipò alla fondazione dell’AS Roma nel 1927.\nIl campo intitolato a Mazzone ha ora un manto sintetico da 42 mm, spogliatoi rinnovati, tribune accessibili a tutti e sarà a disposizione delle scuole del quartiere per realizzare eventi che possano coinvolgere il territorio.\nOltre al Chief Football Operating Officer dell’AS Roma Maurizio Lombardo, alla cerimonia di intitolazione del campo hanno partecipato i familiari di Carlo Mazzone insieme al Sindaco di Roma Roberto Gualtieri, al Presidente del Municipio XII Elio Tomassetti, al Sindaco di Ascoli Piceno Marco Fioravanti e ad alcuni calciatori giallorossi del passato legati al mister come Massimiliano Cappioli, Fabio Petruzzi, Sebino Nela e Franco Peccenini.\n“Porto i saluti da parte della famiglia Friedkin e della società, che è sempre presente per queste occasioni”, ha detto Maurizio Lombardo, che ha donato al nipotino di Carlo Mazzone una maglia personalizzata a nome del Club. “Non ho mai avuto la possibilità di lavorare con lui ma è come se lo conoscessi, perché tutti ne hanno parlato benissimo e ha scritto pagine di storia per la Roma e per altri club della nostra nazione. Ringrazio le istituzioni che hanno permesso tutto questo, che aiuta una società come la Roma perché porta passione, sentimento e valore aggiunto per questi ragazzi che hanno la possibilità di crescere in un posto come questo”.",

    "title": "Pope Francis on the Situation in Gaza: \"Yes. It is War. It is Terrorism!\"",
    "text": "The head of the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican, Pope Francis, said that he continues to receive serious and painful news from the Gaza Strip, where, he said, unarmed civilians are the target of bombings and shootings. As part of the traditional Sunday prayer, the Pope addressed the faithful in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican and once again appealed for an end to the war in the “Holy Land”. “Let us not forget our brothers and sisters who suffer from wars in Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and other conflict zones. May the approach of Christmas strengthen efforts to open paths to peace,” the Pope said. Francis also spoke about the Israeli army’s attacks on Christians and churches in the Gaza Strip. Pointing out that unarmed civilians are exposed to bombing and shooting, Pope Francis stated that this happened even inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists, but families, children, people who are sick or disabled, and nuns. “A mother, Mrs. Nahida Khalil Anton, and her daughter Samar Kamal Anton, were killed by snipers while they were going to the toilet and many people were wounded. The home of Mother Teresa’s nuns was damaged, and the generator was hit. Some say this is terrorism, this is war. Yes. It is war. It is terrorism,” the pope emphasized, [N1](https://n1info.ba/svijet/papa-franjo-o-situaciji-u-gazi-jeste-ovo-je-rat-ovo-je-terorizam/) writes. E.Dz.",

    "text": "Venerdì all'insegna della pioggia al Masters 1000 di Miami. Una giornata segnata proprio dal maltempo che ha costretto gli organizzatori a rinviare più volte l'inizio della giornata, modificando anche l'ordine di gioco con i nove match di doppio cancellati. La pioggia senza sosta si è abbattuta sulla Florida dalle prime ore del giorno fino a metà pomeriggio statunitense, con gli organizzatori che hanno approfittato di una finestra senza acquazzoni dopo le 21 italiane per asciugare i campi dare il via alle partite. Tra queste c'è anche quella di Jannik Sinner (che ha ingannato il tempo giocando a calcio con un bambino) contro Andrea Vavassori, secondo match in programma sullo Stadium. Oltre all'altoatesino e il torinese, nella notte italiana dovrebbero giocare anche Flavio Cobolli, Matteo Arnaldi, Jasmine Paolini e Camila Giorgi.\n In campo anche la numero due del mondo Aryna Sabalenka contro la spagnola PaulaBadosa. La bielorussa ha dovuto dire addio nei giorni scorsi all'ex fidanzato Konstantin Koltsov morto sucida secondo la polizia.",

    "text": "Blog\nHow to Maximize the Potential of Your ERGs\nCreating or strengthening a company ERG? Corporate leaders share tips for success.\nEmployee Resource Groups (ERGs) can be powerful tools for organizations striving to advance an inclusive culture and support employee development. But how, exactly, do you make your ERGs effective drivers of workplace inclusion?\nDow Chemical’s Shruti Bahadur, Global Employee Experience and ERG Leader, and Tiffany D. Torain, Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Relationship Manager for the Great Lakes Bay Region, offered up these helpful guidelines for maximizing ERG potential at the\n2024 Catalyst Awards. Above all else, it’s key to have an intentional focus and take deliberate action to drive meaningful progress and results. Read on to learn how to put these principles into action.\n- Offer a solid value proposition: Don’t forget that ERGs are first and foremost a resource for employees. ERGs can offer them a voice within the organization, cultivate positive workplace experiences, and provide a platform for business growth. An ERG must be welcoming, foster cross-collaboration, and align with organizational core values.\n- Create a robust governance structure: For ERGs to meet their potential, you need to maintain open pathways of communication from both company leadership and ERG members, and the right governance structure can achieve this. For example, an office of inclusion might be at the center, under the supervision of executive sponsors from firm leadership who can share their annual business targets and objectives. ERG sponsors can work alongside this “central office,” sharing feedback from ERG members as well as communicating firmwide goals to the ERGs. This creates a robust feedback loop, collaboration at all levels, and a platform for enterprise engagement.\n- Design mechanisms for measurement and accountability: To ensure that ERGs are effective, it’s important to have tools to measure their success. For example, many ERGs create dashboards that display the number of members, a lineup of future events or projects, past event attendance, and any other relevant data. Once you have established the right metrics to track your ERGs’ progress, don’t forget to schedule regular check-ins with ERG sponsors to review results and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n- Align ERGs with strategic priorities: Don’t forget to activate your ERGs to help with organizational priorities, for example recruiting or increasing supplier diversity. Roll out an agenda of priorities each year, but make sure that your ERGs have enough flexibility to develop programming that works for their audience. For example, an ERG that focuses on people with disabilities might help an organization design packaging that is easier to open.\n- Focus on engagement: It’s critical for employees to feel genuinely engaged with their ERGs and inspired to participate in a meaningful way. Collaboration with other ERGs can help to increase allyship and amplify impact, so don’t forget to provide opportunities for members of different ERGs to connect, learn from one another, and volunteer. For example, all-ERG conferences allow representatives from each ERG to come together to learn from one another and get inspired.\n- Promote advocacy and action: ERGs are a great way to transform your organization’s vocal support for inclusion into actions that directly benefit employees. They have the potential to communicate to company leadership which benefits and policies would make the biggest difference for employees. For example, a company might choose to adjust its parental leave policies to include those who are not birth parents, or offer more targeted flex-work options.\nEmployee Resource Groups have so much to offer an organization: they increase employee satisfaction, they are a fantastic conduit for employee feedback to leadership, and they can provide invaluable assistance with organizational initiatives. By maximizing the potential of your ERGs for inclusion, you can bring your diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative—and your organization—to a whole new level.\nJoin us at enERGize on 5 June, an online learning engagement for ERG leaders, members, and sponsors, and other DEI leaders. Attendees will learn to engage in effective partnership across lines of business and at all levels of their organization.\nBy leveraging Catalyst’s unparalleled research in the DEI space, the event provides innovative tools and solutions to build cost-effective ERGs that drive inclusion, employee engagement, and retention in a shifting labor landscape.\nREGISTER FOR CATALYST ENERGIZE",

    "text": "Lisa Schnirring Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Dima Sidelnikov/iStock\nShare Copied to clipboard\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) said yesterday that tests have confirmed H5 avian flu in two cats that died after drinking recalled raw milk that it is investigating three other possible cases in cats that weren't exposed to raw milk.\nIn other developments, health officials in Wisconsin and Louisiana shared a few more illness details on recently announced suspected and confirmed human cases, respectively, and federal officials confirmed more outbreaks in cows and poultry.\nRaw meat may be culprit in latest cat illnesses The confirmed LA County infections involve indoor cats from the same household, which were initially announced as suspected cases on December 12 . After drinking raw milk from Raw Farm, the cats experienced appetite loss, fever, and neurologic signs. They initially tested positive for influenza A, which officials said is rare in cats. Other pets in the household are under quarantine.\nMeanwhile, officials are investigating possible infections in three other cats from a different household. One tested positive for influenza A, and the others died from presumed influenza A. Confirmation tests are under way.\nThe three cats with suspected infections don't have any known exposure to raw milk, and investigators are examining other potential sources of the virus, including raw meat. People exposed to the three cats are under symptom monitoring and have been offered antiviral prophylaxis.\nBarbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, Med, director of LACDPH, said, \"The risk of H5 bird flu remains low in Los Angeles County, but these confirmed cases of the virus in pet cats are a reminder that consuming raw dairy and meat products can lead to severe illness in cats.\"\nShe urged residents and their pets to avoid raw milk and undercooked meat products, limit exposure to sick and dead animals, report sick and dead birds, and keep pets and poultry away from wild birds.\nMore details on recent human cases In other developments, Wisconsin health officials shared more details about the state's first presumptive positive case, announced yesterday.\nAt a media briefing following the announcement yesterday, Thomas Haupt, MS, respiratory disease epidemiologist with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the patient is a woman who worked on a farm and had mild flu symptoms that included sore throat, a slight fever, fatigue, and some eye discharge. She has finished a course of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and is recovering.\nDarlene Konkle, DVM, Wisconsin's state veterinarian, said though the genotype isn't known, the virus that infected the worker is likely a genotype circulating in wild birds, given that Wisconsin doesn't have any outbreaks of the B3.13 virus in dairy cattle.\nRegarding Louisiana’s recently confirmed severe case, BNO News reported yesterday, citing a health department spokeswoman, that the patient is older than 65 years and has underlying medical conditions. The patient remains hospitalized and is in critical condition.\nMore confirmations in dairy cows, poultry The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed yet another outbreak in dairy cattle in California. The confirmation lifts the state's total since late August to 650 and the national total to 866 across 16 states.\nIn addition, APHIS confirmed more poultry outbreaks in four states, including a backyard flock in Louisiana's Jefferson Davis Parish in the southwest, marking the state's second such outbreak. Two other confirmations were in backyard flocks North Dakota's Nelson County and Iowa's Monona County.\nMeanwhile, the virus was confirmed at more commercial farms, including layer facilities in Iowa's O'Brien and Sioux counties, a turkey farm in Iowa's Worth County, and a layer pullet farm in California's Merced County.\nIn a related development, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection yesterday reported a second outbreak in poultry, this time in Kenosha County in the southeast corner of the state.\nRelated news Previous Next Avian flu infects 2 more California dairy workers as CDC confirms Wisconsin case Lisa Schnirring Wisconsin reports presumptive avian flu in poultry worker as California declares emergency Lisa Schnirring CDC confirms first severe H5N1 case in US patient Lisa Schnirring Flu surveillance flags probable H5 avian flu case in Delaware Lisa Schnirring Positive avian flu bulk-tank tests prompt another raw-milk recall in California Lisa Schnirring Louisiana reports its first probable human H5N1 case as California logs 2 more Mary Van Beusekom Avian flu suspected in cats that drank raw milk as virus kills animals at Arizona zoo Lisa Schnirring California health officials probe raw milk link in child's flu A infection Lisa Schnirring This week's top reads Avian flu suspected in cats that drank raw milk as virus kills animals at Arizona zoo In other developments, federal and state officials report more detections in dairy cows, poultry, and wild birds.\nLisa Schnirring Cases rise in unexplained DR Congo outbreak amid testing challenges A group of 78 more samples, a variety of types, are on their way to the INRB lab in Kinshasa.\nLisa Schnirring Wisconsin reports presumptive avian flu in poultry worker as California declares emergency California's dairy farm outbreaks have spread beyond the Central Valley to the southern part of the state.\nLisa Schnirring Indicators show US flu and COVID activity rising Flu activity continues to elevate, and COVID-19 markers are also starting to rise from very low levels.\nLisa Schnirring Louisiana reports its first probable human H5N1 case as California logs 2 more The Louisiana patient, who was exposed to sick and dead birds with suspected infection, has been hospitalized.\nMary Van Beusekom Health workers think COVID, flu vaccines safe and effective, but many remain hesitant, global survey shows Many participants believe that pharmaceutical firms and public health officials minimized the vaccines' side effects.\nMary Van Beusekom CDC confirms first severe H5N1 case in US patient The infection also marks the first US case with exposure to backyard poultry, which fits H5N1's global pattern.\nLisa Schnirring Flu surveillance flags probable H5 avian flu case in Delaware Also, the USDA reported more confirmations in cows, poultry, and other mammals and Labcorp announced the launch of its H5 molecular test.\nLisa Schnirring COVID-19 linked to more heart complications than flu, RSV The odds of myocarditis were 61% lower in flu and 85% lower in RSV than with COVID-19.\nStephanie Soucheray Los Angeles County confirms avian flu in cat deaths as more cases suspected The three cats with suspected infections don't have any known exposure to raw milk, and investigators are examining other potential sources, including raw meat.\nLisa Schnirring Our underwriters Unrestricted financial support provided by Principal Underwriter Leading Underwriter Major Underwriter Supporting Underwriter Become an Underwriter Help make CIDRAP's vital work possible\nSupport Us Home Editorial policy Search news",

    "text": "January 3, 2025 in News 494 SHARES 1.4k VIEWS Share on Facebook Share on Twitter\nNorthern Florida and the Panhandle appear set for freezing temperatures in January, as a polar vortex is forecast to push frigid winds across the country.\nWhy It Matters As one of the most populous states in the U.S. and a favored winter destination for those looking to escape the northern cold, this news is unlikely to be well received in the Sunshine State.\nWinter weather, including ice and snow, can severely affect travel safety and disrupt daily activities, often leading to school closures.\nVulnerable groups, such as young infants and senior citizens, are among those particularly at risk from the health hazards posed by freezing temperatures.\nWhat To Know According to a forecast map by Pivotal Weather, based on data from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts and visualized below by Newsweek , most of Florida’s northern and northwestern counties will see temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit in the first week of January.\nIn Santa Rosa County, for example, wind chills as cold as 22 degrees were forecast.\nNearby Okaloosa and Walton counties would fare similarly, the data showed.\nHolmes and Jackson counties were both forecast for 23 degrees. Bay, Calhoun, and Liberty counties were forecast for 25.\nMoving southward, temperatures improve, though only marginally, with counties like Gilchrist, Alachua, and Bradford just breaking into the low 30s.\nPivotal Weather said the map was valid until January 7, although forecasts are often updated.\nThe Arctic polar vortex is a strong band of west-to-east winds that form in the stratosphere during winter, approximately 10 to 30 miles above the North Pole.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, the polar vortex often expands, driving cold air southward alongside the jet stream, according to the agency.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) previously forecast a high likelihood of the Sunshine State seeing below-average temperatures this January.\nWhat People Are Saying Meteorologist John Brown wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday: “Artic air could bring Florida the coldest weather of the year, lows may reach freezing levels.”\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist John Feerick told Newsweek: “Cold temperatures are likely to have the greatest impact in northern parts of the state and across the interior. Actual temperatures can drop below freezing at night in the north and it’s possible the interior of central Florida also dips below the freezing mark.”\nWhat Happens Next Forecast models have predicted that cold air will spread across the U.S. from early to mid-January.\nThe NWS urges the public to monitor their local forecast at weather.gov to ensure they are dressed appropriately for the weather. While the agency stressed that there was no reason for alarm about the polar vortex, it advised staying prepared for colder conditions.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

    "text": "( MENAFN - PR Newswire) EL-DHEER, Somalia, Dec. 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- In a remarkable turn of events,\nEl-Dheer town in Somalia, once held captive by the oppressive rule of Al-Shabaab for 16 long years, is now basking in the glow of newfound freedom and peace. Government forces, in collaboration with local freedom fighters, successfully liberated the town, culminating in a significant victory over the notorious terrorist group.\nContinue Reading\nJournalist Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar interviews leader of Somali freedom fighters, Khalif Omar Moalim Nur.\nPost this\nKhalif Omar Moalim Nur, leader of local Somali freedom fighters in El-Dheer, the former stronghold of al-Shabaab pirates.\nSenior NewsBlaze journalist Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar had the privilege of conducting an exclusive interview with the charismatic leader of the local freedom fighters, Khalif Omar Moalim Nur. Despite the challenges, Khalif Omar Moalim Nur and his forces played a pivotal role in driving Al-Shabaab militants from El-Dheer, bringing an end to years of Al-Shabaab brutality.\nRead the full story here:\nThe interview, conducted via phone from the Khalif's base in a remote area outside El-Dheer, offers a unique insight into the operation and the ongoing efforts to eliminate any remaining Al-Shabaab remnants in the region.\nThe Khalif expressed cautious optimism about the future, emphasizing a commitment to continue the fight until the entire central Galgduud region is free from the clutches of terrorism. The leader underscored the importance of witnessing the transformation firsthand, inviting local and international media to observe the resurgence of normalcy in El-Dheer and neighboring areas.\nThe strategic control over coastal regions was highlighted by the Khalif as a significant blow to Al-Shabaab, rendering them landlocked and disrupting their ability to escape or import crucial supplies. The liberation of seaports Igo and Mareeg, once under the control of militants, marks a turning point in the fight against Al-Shabaab.\nResidents, who endured so much hardship, can now experience a gradual return to normalcy. Some medical care has been reinstated, and the reopening of the town's hospital stands as a testament to positive changes. However, challenges persist, and schools need repairs and learning materials. The international community is urged to support the region's recovery, with assistance to rebuild what was destroyed during years of Al-Shabaab rule.\nAs the world witnesses the triumph of resilience over terror in El-Dheer, NewsBlaze remains committed to surfacing the stories of hope and recovery from regions emerging from the shadows of conflict.\nFor media inquiries or further information, please contact:\nAlan Gray\nMaxMention\ncontact@MaxMention. com\n+1 775 241 8446\nAbout Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar\nShafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar Islaw is an accomplished journalist based in the UK with a versatile portfolio that spans a range of subjects, including sports.

    "text": "Uma adolescente nascida em Balneário Camboriú morreu vítima de bombardeio no Líbano. Mirna Raef Nasser tinha apenas 16 anos. O pai dela, nascido naquele país, também faleceu. Os dois tinham deixado a casa de um parente e voltado à residência onde moravam para buscar roupas e material escolar quando foram surpreendidos por um ataque aéreo.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nReceba notícias por WhatsApp\nPai e filha morrem na segunda-feira (23) e os familiares só conseguiram tirar os corpos dos escombros no dia seguinte, quando o bombardeio cessou. As informações são do tio e irmão das vítimas, Ali Nasser.\nMirna deixou o Brasil quando tinha apenas um ano e dois meses. Ela foi descrita como uma jovem alegre, inteligente e que gostava muito da família. Os três irmãos e a mãe dela não estavam no local do ataque e foram levados em segurança à capital do Líbano. Os corpos estão em um hospital da região, aguardando condições seguras para a famílias fazer os sepultamentos.\nVeja fotos de Mirna Mirna e o pai morreram no ataque (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) A jovem nasceu em Balneário Camboriú (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) Ela morreu ao buscar o material escolar (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) Casa onde Mirna e a família moravam (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) Imóvel foi destruído no bombardeio (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) (Foto: Arquivo pessoal) Voltar Avançar\nContinua depois da publicidade\nAli conta que ele e os irmãos vieram para o Brasil incentivados pelo pai justamente por causa dos constantes conflitos no Líbano. O homem revela que até mesmo terras que o pai tinha no país eram proibidas por Israel de serem acessadas. Após nove anos em solo brasileiro, o pai de Mirna decidiu voltar ao país de origem com a esposa e os filhos.\nAté então, a cidade onde a família morava não convivia com bombardeios, mas o conflito se intensificou recentemente, conforme Ali. Na manhã em que o irmão e a sobrinha morreram, ele chegou a mandar mensagens e estranhou a demora de resposta. Pouco tempo depois veio a informação dos óbitos.

    "text": "© Getty Images La Roma si è qualificata ai quarti di finale di Europa League e De Rossi si gode il traguardo dopo aver eliminato il Brighton di De Zerbi: \"I complimenti sono da fare ai ragazzi che all'andata hanno fatto il grosso del lavoro. Abbiamo fatto una prestazione attenta e di personalità, anche se avremmo potuto fare un po' meglio per rifiatare - ha commentato il tecnico giallorosso -. Baldanzi ? Lo vedo sempre in allenamento e per me è in grande evoluzione. Alla prima esperienza di questo tipo ha fatto molto bene, ma giorno dopo giorno è sempre più un giocatore da Roma , ma può essere ancora più decisivo\".\nLa Roma ha gestito l'enorme vantaggio dell'andata soffrendo il giusto: \"Con la palla potevamo fare meglio anche se è vero che il Brighton te la fa vedere poco. Potevamo attirarli un po' di più per sfruttare le ripartenze, invece abbiamo giocato un po' troppi palloni lunghi. Ogni volta che saltavamo la pressione per loro era difficile prenderci\".\nIn Inghilterra si è vista una squadra brillante dal punto di vista fisico: \"I ragazzi li ho trovati in condizione fisica buona e in allenamento tutti, ma veramente tutti vanno forte. Se ti alleni bene poi le prestazioni fisiche le fai e in Europa servono. Bisogna essere più lucidi con la palla perché le qualità le abbiamo\" ha proseguito De Rossi a Sky.\nAi quarti di finale ci sarà un avversario di prestigio: \"Rispetto agli ultimi anni non è caduta nemmeno una big, ma è normale. Abbiamo già avuto due turni difficili e siamo pronti per affrontarne altri che se da una parte è stimolante, dall'altra ogni tanto vorremmo avere un pizzico di fortuna. Nessuno sarà contento di affrontare la Roma \".",
