    "text": "Parcourez la nécrologie de Wendy Irene Macintyre Fraser June 20 1954 August 26 2024 70 Years Old résidant dans la province Nova Scotia pour le détail des funérailles Wendy Fraser Obituary It is with heavy hearts and profound sorrow that we, the family, announce the passing of Wendy Irene (Macintyre) Fraser on Monday, August 26, 2024, following a hard-fought and courageous battle with cancer. While cancer may have ultimately won the fight, Wendy will forever live on in our memories and our hearts. Born in Sydney Mines on June 20, 1954, Wendy was one of seventeen children born to the late Rod (Topper) and Ellen (Vickers) Macintyre. She was a loving mother, grandmother, partner, sister, aunt, and friend and will be greatly missed by all those who knew and loved her. Prior to her illness, Wendy had been employed as head bartender at Branch 8 Legion in Sydney Mines for 46 years. She was a long-time member of Branch 8 and a 50-year member of the Ladies Auxiliary, having served as its president for 26 years before stepping down due to ill health. Wendy dedicated her entire adult life to working for and on behalf of veterans and received many awards for her hard work and dedication. For her dedication and commitment, Wendy was awarded the Meritorious Service Award (Auxiliary) and the Meritorious Service Medal (Branch). She was also awarded the Palm Leaf, which is one of the highest awards a legion member can receive. This award recognized not only her work on behalf of the branch and veterans but also her community involvement. Wendy also catered to many suppers at the Legion and was known in the community for her delicious meals (especially her gravy). Before her illness, Wendy loved to travel whenever she could. Her travels took her to many places, including Spain, New Orleans, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, to name but a few. Wendy was also an avid bingo player and never found a bingo game she didn’t like. Wendy enjoyed life and lived life to the fullest. Wendy is survived by daughters Crystal Serafinus and Nicole Fraser and grandchildren Brianne, Logan, Zach, Keisha, Jeremiah, Grayson, and Zoe. She is also survived by her loving partner, Brian Bobbitt, who was by her side through it all and who was her rock to lean on. Also, stepdaughters Holly MacMillan (Mike) and Crystal Larade (Joe), stepson Brian Bobbitt Jr. (Victoria), and step-grandchildren MC, Max, Madison, Emma, and Leah. Also left to mourn her loss are her sisters Ann Mann (Jim), Barbara Macintyre (Paul), Cathy Macintosh (George), and Heather Macintyre (Sharon) and brothers Len Macintyre (Margie) and Cliff Macintyre (Ruth). Also, by numerous nieces and nephews. Besides her parents, Rod and Ellen, Wendy was predeceased by sisters Bev Tobin, Alice Power, Bernetta MacGean and, three sisters in infancy, and brothers Arthur, Purvis, Clayton, and Raymond MacIntyre. While our hearts mourn Wendy’s loss, we take comfort in the fact that she is no longer suffering. A special thank you to the VON and the palliative care nurses for the excellent care provided to Wendy, both at home and at the An Cala Palliative Care unit at the Regional. Your kindness and compassion were greatly appreciated. Also, a heartfelt thank you to Mary Helen Luker, friend and caregiver, who went above and beyond for Wendy and the entire family. We will be forever grateful. Per Wendy’s wishes, cremation has taken place. A celebration of Wendy’s life will be held at Branch 8 Legion, Main Street, Sydney Mines, on September 27, 2024. The family will receive visitors at a meet & greet at 1 pm, followed by the service at 2 pm. Light lunch will follow. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the An Cala Palliative Care Unit at the Regional Hospital or to a charity of one’s choice.

    "title": "UN ‘appalled’ by killing of 50 people in Mali attacks",
    "text": "GENEVA: The UN rights chief said Thursday he was “appalled” by alleged summary executions of 25 people by Mali´s army and “foreign military personnel” last week in a region plagued by jihadist insurgency. Volker Turk also expressed alarm at the killing of around 30 others in attacks at the weekend in central Mali, a particular hotbed of violence. “I am appalled by credible allegations that Malian armed forces accompanied by foreign military personnel summarily executed at least 25 people in Welingara village, in the central Nara region on 26 January,” Turk said in a statement. “I am also alarmed by reports that about 30 civilians were killed in attacks by yet unidentified gunmen on two other villages — Ogota and Oimbe — in the Bandiagara region over this past weekend,” he added. Gathering and verifying information in Mali is made difficult by the country´s vast geography, detriorating communications and security concerns. Jihadist violence that started in northern Mali in 2012 spread to the centre of the country in 2015, when Katiba Macina — an Al Qaeda-affiliated group — was established, led by the Fulani preacher Amadou Kouffa. Mali is led by a junta that seized power in 2020 and turned away from former colonial power France, before pushing the UN stabilisation mission MINUSMA to leave at the end of 2023. The junta has chosen instead to pivot towards Russia, both politically and militarily. Many observers claim it has enlisted the services of Russian mercenaries, despite constant denials. The UN and local sources regularly accuse the Malian army and its allies of abuses against civilians, which they systematically deny. UN rights investigators say Malian troops and foreign forces — presumed to be Wagner -- were behind the massacre of at least 500 people in the central Malian town of Moura in March 2022. “It is essential that all allegations of arbitrary deprivations of life, including summary executions, are fully and impartially investigated and those found responsible brought to justice in trials observing international standards,” the UN rights chief said Thursday. To date, none of the investigations launched in Mali into abuses by the military have been successful. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for blast, which followed flurry of strikes by Huthis US Rear Admiral Carlos Sardiello called the joint exercises — involving around a dozen US ships It also offers rare window into lengths DEA was willing to go to fight drug war in a country that banned US drug... “I will never forget the day that I ran up to my high school's Mac lab and signed up for Facebook,” Intelligence...

    "text": "RICHBORO, Pa. (WPVI) - A family in Pennsylvania says they have a quick-thinking Taco Bell manager to thank for saving their child’s life.\nNatasha Long says the situation started when her 11-week-old baby suddenly stopped breathing while she was in the drive-thru at the fast-food restaurant.\n“It was the scariest moment of my entire life,” Long said.\nThe mother of two had just finished some errands and decided to grab food when she says she noticed baby Myles struggling for air in the back seat of the car.\n“I pulled him out and he turned completely blue and was lifeless. At that point I just completely blacked out. I didn’t know what to do,” she said.\nFortunately, Long was in earshot of Taco Bell manager Becky Arbaugh, who heard the mother’s screams and quickly jumped in to give baby Myles CPR.\n“I ran outside and took the baby,” Arbaugh said. “I then started to do chest compressions on the baby, and he finally started to breathe.”\nLong said the manager appeared out of nowhere like a guardian angel.\nAccording to Arbaugh, her own scares as a mother helped her prepare for a moment like this.\n“When my kids were little, my daughter had similar incidents. So, I knew what she was feeling, and there was no thought in my mind that the baby wasn’t going to breathe again,” Arbaugh said.\nBaby Myles did regain his breath and was rushed to Saint Christopher’s Hospital for treatment.\nThe next day Long said she called Taco Bell to thank Arbaugh, who she calls her hero.\n“We couldn’t be more grateful to Becky. She saved my son’s life,” Long said.\nBaby Myles remains in the hospital as doctors try to understand what happened to him.\nMeanwhile, Long has been sending videos and pictures to Arbaugh -- who now has a deep bond with the family.\nCopyright 2024 WPVI via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "Desde marzo pasado, la prensa estadounidense dio a conocer que Jennifer López y Ben Affleck enfrentan una crisis matrimonial que los mantiene separados. Desde ese momento a la fecha, los famosos [han evidenciado que no están juntos](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/espectaculos/2024/7/20/jennifer-lopez-subio-unas-fotos-que-delatan-que-podria-divorciarse-de-ben-affleck-622636.html) porque han hecho sus vidas por separado. Sumado a esto, ahora se dio a conocer que la separación es un hecho porque las estrellas de Hollywood están próximas a hacer pública la ruptura amorosa. El medio Page Six informó que JLo y el actor y director están separados y la conclusión del matrimonio se encamina a un “cierre de varios millones de dólares” debido a que ambos son figuras altamente posicionadas porque cuentan con grandes fortunas. La actriz, de 55 años de edad, posee un patrimonio neto de 400 millones dólares y el protagonista de “Pearl Harbor” tiene en su cuenta bancaria $150 millones de dólares, según información de Celebrity Net Worth.

Esto quiere decir que la pareja daría este paso a finales de septiembre, que es cuando oficialmente concluirá la temporada veraniega. De momento, ni “La diva del Bronx” ni el director del cine han abordado el tema, pero un amigo cercano de ambos habló con Page Six y expuso que los famosos tenían pendiente su historia de amor porque salieron por primera vez entre 2002 y 2004 cuando incluso se comprometieron, pero se separaron por la presión mediática. Por qué Jennifer López y Ben Affleck se separaron Luego de casi 20 años, en 2021 Jennifer López y Ben Affleck retomaron su relación y en 2022 se casaron; primero en Las Vegas, Nevada, y luego en Riceboro, Georgia. A pesar de esto, la pareja enfrentó altibajos en su matrimonio “y ahora saben, por fin, que no están hechos para ello. Ya no hay preguntas que resolver. Se han dado cuenta de lo que tenían que saber y es el final definitivo”, destacó la fuente entrevistada. La misma fuente indicó que el matrimonio de las estrellas de Hollywood se dio porque “se dejaron llevar por el momento. Jennifer ha querido esa boda -los trajes, los amigos, los adornos, los manjares- por décadas”, pero Ben Affleck no quería precisamente lo mismo, pero cedió para complacer a la intérprete de “Jenny from the Block”.",
