    "title": "Lunar New Year becomes a recognized holiday in WA",
    "text": "Gov. Jay Inslee signed legislation Wednesday officially making Lunar New Year a recognized legislative holiday in Washington.\nThe bill’s sponsor, Rep. My-Linh Thai, D-Bellevue, proposed it as part of an effort to\npromote inclusion of Asian Americans earlier this year. The bill passed the house on Jan. 31 with a vote of 96-1 and on Feb. 28 it unanimously passed the Senate with a 96-0 vote.\nWashington now joins\nColorado and California, which mark Lunar New Year as an official, but unpaid, holiday. In recent years, New York and Philadelphia began recognizing it as a public school holiday, and U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., reintroduced a proposal to make Lunar New Year a federal holiday.\nAlthough Washington’s newest state-recognized holiday is not a paid day off for those who celebrate, Thai said this moment still sends a message of belonging to Asian Americans.\n“I hope that our children get to see themselves,” said Thai, who had a group of students with her in the room during the bill’s signing on Wednesday. “I want them to see within society and culture, at least in Washington state, that we see them, that we heard them and that we acknowledge them.”\n“They are American,” she added. “They are part of the fabric of what makes Washington Washington, and they can be proud of who they are.”\nThai, who immigrated to Washington as a Vietnamese refugee when she was 15, said the new law builds on a dream she had during her teenage years to preserve a culture that has nourished her and “made me who I am.”\nLunar New Year celebrations include Tết in Vietnam, Seollal in Korea and Spring Festival in China. Because the holiday is based on the lunar calendar, it isn’t on a set day and floats between January and February. Lunar New Year is generally a 15-day celebration.\nConnie So, a professor of American ethnic studies at the University of Washington, praised the law’s passage for recognizing the large communities that celebrate the holiday and acknowledging a cultural tradition without European roots.\nMore than 900,000 Washingtonians identify as Asian,\nabout 12% of the state’s population and about 20% of King County’s population, according to 2020 census data. The law comes more than a year after legislation calling for it to become a paid holiday failed to advance through the state Legislature.\nLast year’s bill,\nHB 1516, would have made Lunar New Year a paid state holiday that gave state employees and public schools the day off. The 2023 bill would have cost about $5.7 million every two years, according to a fiscal note. Thai’s new proposal estimates needing $10,000 the first year to hire a consultant and purchase materials for the commission and $4,000 every two years after that to update programming.\nThe legislature\ncurrently recognizes 19 days that are not considered legal holidays, including Korean American Day, Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day and Human Trafficking Awareness Day. There are 11 paid state legal holidays, including Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Presidents Day. Juneteenth, which has been federally observed since 2021, was designated as a day of remembrance in Washington in 2007 before it became a paid state holiday in 2022.\nThai hopes the new law will build momentum at the national level for Lunar New Year to become a federal holiday. Thai added this legislation is a tool to spread awareness of a culturally significant holiday as well as combat anti-Asian racism and xenophobia targeting many Asian Americans.\n“Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians live across our nation, and when one of us suffers and is not being seen, all of us suffer,” Thai said. “I want to see this as a national movement, and we can do this. It’s not just California, It’s not just Colorado, nor is it just Washington. It should be recognized in all 50 states.”",

    "text": "A Kitchener boxing legend is raising concerns over the sport possibly being dropped from the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has yet to include boxing on the 2028 program after stripping the International Boxing Association (IBA) of its Olympic recognition over differences in governance, finance, and ethics. In a statement released in May, the IOC said in part: “Olympic boxing needs to be organized by a credible, well-governed international federation. It is therefore already clear that any boxer whose national federation adheres to the IBA will not be able to participate in the Olympics Games LA28.” Fitz “The Whip” Vanderpool is one of the most decorated Canadian boxers in history. His career titles wins include the Canadian Professional Boxing Federation title, World Boxing Federation Intercontinental title, World Boxing Council Welterweight Fecarbox title, World Boxing Federation Superwelterweight World title and the World Boxing Council Superwelterweight Fecarbox title. The Waterloo County Sports Hall of Famer said his commitment to the sport began in 1988, after watching the Summer Games in Seoul. “Lennox [Lewis] was there and there was another guy Asif Dar who was very good. Those are the guys I grew up fighting with and they were there,” Vanderpool told CTV News. “I’m like, ‘Man I want to be there.’” Vanderpool says the IOC’s decision to keep boxing out of the Olympics is a massive blow to boxers at all levels, especially Olympic hopefuls. “They put all those years and that time in getting ready for the Olympics and you’re going to take that from these kids,” Vanderpool said. “You’re kind of pulling the plug on something and you’re letting the air out of the balloon.” Jesse Phillips is a youth boxer from Kitchener. Currently 16-years-old, he’ll be 20 when the LA Games begin. “ [In] four to five years I could potentially be in the Olympics if I work hard enough,” Phillips told CTV News. “If it’s just gone what are they fighting for? They train lots of years and it’s just gone.” The IOC says a final decision on the LA Games will be made by 2025.

    "text": "According to DelveInsight's analysis, the growth of the gene therapies market in ophthalmology is expected to be mainly driven by the increasing prevalence of eye disease, rise in awareness and access to treatment, increased adoption of enhanced genetic testing and robust pipeline activity for eye disease in the 7MM. LAS VEGAS, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DelveInsight's Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market Insights report includes a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging gene therapy in ophthalmology, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted market size from 2020 to 2034, segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].Key Takeaways from the Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market ReportAccording to DelveInsight's analysis, the market size for gene therapies in ophthalmology reached roughly USD 132 million in 2023 across the 7MM.The ophthalmology segment has emerged as the major therapeutic area targeted for the current clinical development of gene therapies, with indications including Retinitis Pigmentosa, Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Achromatopsia, Leber Congenital Amaurosis, Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), Stargardt Disease, and others. DelveInsight's analysis reveals that out of all the rare indications in ophthalmology, Retinitis Pigmentosa has the highest rate of gene therapies development. Furthermore, Wet-AMD, Geographic atrophy, and Diabetic Retinopathy have the largest prevalent pool among the target indications for gene therapies in ophthalmology. Leading gene therapy in ophthalmology companies such as BEACON THERAPEUTICS, NANOSCOPE THERAPEUTICS, COAVE THERAPEUTICS, BIONIC SIGHT, GENSIGHT BIOLOGICS, ADVERUM BIOTECHNOLOGIES, EYEVENSYS, EXEGENESIS BIO, MEIRAGTX, JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE, NEUROPHTH THERAPEUTICS, 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS, ATSENA THERAPEUTICS, OCUGEN, ABBVIE, REGENXBIO, SKYLINE THERAPEUTICS, HUIDAGENE THERAPEUTICS, OPUS GENETICS, and others are developing novel gene therapy in ophthalmology that can be available in the gene therapy in ophthalmology market in the coming years.The promising gene therapy in ophthalmology in the pipeline include Botaretigene sparoparvovec, AGTC-501, MCO-010, GS030, 4D-125, BS01, CTx-PDE6b, ATSN-101, LUMEVOQ (GS010), NR082 (NFS-01), ABBV-RGX-314, AAV-CNGB3, AGTC-401, JNJ-1887 (HMR-59), 4D-150, Ixo-vec (ADVM-022), and others.4D Molecular Therapeutics is anticipating a Phase II dose expansion interim landmark data analysis of the PRISM study of 4D-150 in wet AMD at the Angiogenesis, Exudation, and Degeneration 2024 Conference and an update on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) feedback on Phase III pivotal trial plan in February 2024. 4D Molecular Therapeutics is also anticipating initial interim landmark data analysis for the Phase II population extension arm of 4D-150 in diabetic macular edema (DME) in the second half of 2024.In December 2023, the US FDA granted the regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation, and in October 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation to 4D-150 for intravitreal treatment of wet AMD.In December 2023, Ocugen announced that the US FDA had granted RMAT designation to OCU400 for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa associated with RHO mutations.Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major gene therapy in ophthalmology market share @ Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology Market ReportGene Therapy in Ophthalmology OverviewGene therapy is becoming a promising solution for retinal degenerative illnesses, particularly due to the retina's suitability for studying and treating eye conditions. Remarkably, it has pioneered approved gene therapy for inherited disorders in the United States, marking a significant advancement in medical treatment. Gene therapy presents a distinctive chance to address and potentially cure retinal degenerative illnesses, bringing optimism to millions impacted by genetic disorders or carrying mutations causing disease. Nevertheless, numerous hurdles must be overcome before gene therapy can be widely accessible for ocular conditions. Key areas such as determining the best timing for intervention, establishing standardized methods for evaluating outcomes, managing inflammation, raising awareness, and ensuring fair access are crucial for progressing treatments for inherited retinal diseases and transforming the outlook for visual impairment.Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Epidemiology SegmentationIn the US, the highest number of diagnosed prevalent cases comprised of diabetic retinopathy with approximately 5.1 million, while the lowest cases comprised of LHON in 2023.In EU4 and the UK, Germany accounted for the highest number of retinitis pigmentosa-treated cases with approximately 24K in 2020.The gene therapies in ophthalmology market report proffer epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020–2034 in the 7MM segmented into:Total Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of Selected Indications for Gene Therapies in OphthalmologyEligible Cases of Selected Indications for Gene Therapies Treated Cases of Selected Indications for Gene Therapies Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Treatment Market In recent years, gene therapy has garnered significant attention in research, especially concerning its application in ocular treatments. The eye is notable among the body's organs as it has gained approval from the FDA for gene therapy, distinguishing it from others in this regard. LUXTURNA, also referred to as voretigene neparvovec-rzyl, is a singular genetic therapy designed to address vision loss caused by a genetic anomaly in both instances of the RPE65 gene. The FDA approved Spark Therapeutics' LUXTURNA in December 2017, while the European Commission (EU) followed suit in November 2018. This authorization extends to all 28 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The approval of LUXTURNA for individuals diagnosed with inherited retinal dystrophy due to biallelic RPE65 mutations, where there are still functional retinal cells, marks a significant advancement in the progress of ocular gene therapy.The main treatment for AMD and DME entails administering injections of anti-VEGF. Vision decline in both ailments arises from unregulated expansion and fluid seepage of retinal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF treatments work by obstructing the overgrowth of these vessels. Current clinical studies are investigating the potential of introducing genes into retinal cells. This method seeks to prompt cells to independently manufacture anti-VEGF, effectively turning retinal cells into small-scale production units for needed proteins. The overarching goal is to reduce the need for frequent injections during treatment.Researchers remain deeply engaged in the field, yet concerns persist regarding potential immune and inflammatory reactions that could undermine the effectiveness or safety of treatments. The eyes, being particularly prone to inflammation, are especially vulnerable to such issues. The severity of these reactions depends largely on the choice of vector and how it is administered. Various preclinical and clinical investigations have highlighted a link between the dosage of the vector and the level of immune response and inflammation in the eye. Moreover, the method of administration directly impacts the intensity of these reactions. For example, subretinal delivery tends to elicit a less pronounced immune response compared to intravitreal injection. Nevertheless, studies have suggested that subretinal delivery may trigger a more vigorous inflammatory response.To know more about gene therapy in ophthalmology, visit @ Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology AnalysisGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Pipeline Therapies and Key CompaniesBOTARETIGENE SPAROPARVOVEC: JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE /MEIRAGTXAGTC-501: BEACON THERAPEUTICSMCO-010: NANOSCOPE THERAPEUTICSGS030: GENSIGHT BIOLOGICS4D 125: 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICSCTX PDE6B: COAVE THERAPEUTICSOCU 400: OCUGENBS01: BIONIC SIGHTLUMEVOQ: GENSIGHT BIOLOGICSNR082 (NFS-01): NEUROPHTH THERAPEUTICSADVM-022 (AAV.7M8-AFLIBERCEPT): ADVERUM BIOTECHNOLOGIESJNJ-1887 (AAVCAGSCD59/JNJ-81201887): JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINEEYS 606: EYEVENSYS4D 150: 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICSEXG102-031: EXEGENESIS BIOAAV-RPE65: MEIRAGTX/JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINEAAV-CNGB3: MEIRAGTX/JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINEAAV-CNGA3: MEIRAGTX/JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINENFS-02: NEUROPHTH THERAPEUTICS4D 110: 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICSATSN-101: ATSENA THERAPEUTICSATSN-201: ATSENA THERAPEUTICSOCU410: OCUGENOCU410ST: OCUGENAGTC-402: BEACON THERAPEUTICSAGTC-401: BEACON THERAPEUTICSABBV-RGX-314: ABBVIE/REGENXBIOSKG0106: SKYLINE THERAPEUTICSHG 004: HUIDAGENE THERAPEUTICSOPGX-001: OPUS GENETICSLearn more about the FDA-approved gene therapy in ophthalmology @ Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Treatment Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market DynamicsThe dynamics of gene therapy in ophthalmology market are expected to change in the coming years. AAVs have emerged as the predominant vectors for delivering genes of interest to target tissues with improved specificity, efficiency, and safety, leading companies to offer innovative payment plans for one-time gene therapies, which can enhance the uptake of gene therapies. Additionally, larger firms, leveraging their resources and expertise, have gained an edge in the gene therapy industry by organizing intricate development pathways. The exponential advancements in the field of gene therapy for eye disease over the past few decades hold the potential to treat most eye diseases caused by genetic mutations.Furthermore, many potential gene therapies are being investigated, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact gene therapy in ophthalmology market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate are expected to drive the growth of gene therapy in ophthalmology market in the 7MM.However, several factors may impede the growth of gene therapy in ophthalmology market. Even when a rare disease therapy is available, the out-of-pocket cost to patients can be prohibitive, as orphan drugs are priced higher than common treatments to generate sufficient returns on investment despite small patient populations. Simply delivering the product to the desired tissue can be a physical challenge due to the isolated nature of the eyes and the delicate nature of diseased tissue, while gene therapies may face more rivalry for production capacity as more companies join the market, potentially increasing prices or reducing its utility as a treatment choice. A potential crisis with gene therapies for rare disorders is looming in Europe, as many companies have failed to secure reimbursement in the EU and withdrawn the drug after approval.Moreover, gene therapy in ophthalmology treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients' overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the gene therapy in the ophthalmology market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies, unaffordable pricing, market access and reimbursement issues, and a shortage of healthcare specialists. In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact gene therapy in ophthalmology market growth.Of the target indications, Retinitis Pigmentosa and Wet AMD are anticipated to generate the most revenue by 2034 due to the highest level of clinical development and authorization of gene therapies. Apart from AMD, ocular diseases associated with diabetes may offer the most commercial potential for gene therapy because millions of people with diabetes suffer from ocular issues. Among them include diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market Report MetricsDetailsStudy Period2020–2034Coverage7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany,
