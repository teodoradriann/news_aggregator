    "text": "Rome – At a High-Level event organized by the Permanent Delegation of Brazil to the United Nations Rome-based agencies and Global Citizen , FAO Director-General QU Dongyu highlighted today the urgent need to prioritize food security and climate action in 2024 and reaffirmed FAO’s support to the G20 Presidency which Brazil currently holds.\nIn a keynote speech, Qu underlined the grim reality of global hunger, reminding that 735 million people faced chronic hunger in 2022 . The Director-General emphasized the interconnectedness of conflicts, climate extremes, and economic crises, stressing their disproportionate impact on food security and nutrition for the poor and vulnerable.\nThe high-level event, held at the Brazilian Embassy in Rome, was hosted by the Ambassador of Brazil to Italy Renato Mosca; the Brazilian Ambassador to the UN Rome Based Agencies Carla Carneiro, and the Global Citizen Vice President of Global Policy and Advocacy Friederike Roder.\nIt also had the participation of other leaders from the UN Rome Based Agencies: Alvaro Lario, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and Carl Skau, Deputy Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, World Food Programme (WFP).\nA high-level panel focused on how the G7 and G20 presidencies, Italy and Brazil respectively, prioritise food security and agricultural adaptation, including with the recently announced G20 Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty to be launched in November.\nAmong the panelists were the Director General for Development Cooperation and Special Envoy for Food Security of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Stefano Gatti; and the Permanent Representative to the UN Agencies in Rome of the Republic of South Africa, Nosipho Nausca-Jean Jezile.\n“FAO is pleased with the fruitful synergy and effective collaboration with the Government of Brazil, and we continue to be committed to providing our full technical and professional support for a successful G20 under Brazil’s Presidency”, the FAO Director-General said.\nLinking poverty and hunger, Qu also pointed out the alarming connection between inequality and various forms of malnutrition, contributing to a triple burden. He urged the expansion of social protection programs, citing Brazil as a successful example with its conditional cash transfers. However, he stressed the need for innovation in social protection, particularly in response to climate shocks.\nLooking towards long-term solutions, the Director-General outlined the need for investments in infrastructure, digitalization, innovation, and technologies, along with a crucial focus on human capital through improved education and health services.\n“Significantly increased and more targeted investment to transform global agrifood systems will be necessary to reduce hunger, bring people out of poverty and promote sustainable agricultural production,” he explained, noting that transforming agrifood systems would require an investment of $4 trillion from now to 2030 in low- and middle-income countries.\nQu stressed the importance of increased investments for a more diverse and productive agricultural sector that promotes nutritious foods and highlighted the sector’s role in addressing all dimensions of sustainable development, including climate action.\nThe Director General explained that although agrifood systems are responsible for about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions transforming them can improve their efficiency and make them more inclusive and resilient.\nHe cited the recently launched Global Roadmap for Achieving SDG2 without breaching the 1.5C threshold as an innovative plan and concrete package of solutions to support achieving Zero Hunger and accelerating climate actions.\n“The roadmap could also act as a catalyst for increased financing”, he said.",

Isso porque o Clube presidido por Augusto Melo não consegue manter boa sequência, e tem uma enorme dívida declarada.\n© Jorge Rodrigues RJ - RIO DE JANEIRO - 17/08/2024 - BRASILEIRO A 2024, FLUMINENSE X CORINTHIANS - Augusto Melo presidente do Corinthians antes da partida contra o Fluminense no estadio Maracana pelo campeonato Brasileiro A 2024.

Augusto Melo perdeu o apoio que tinha dentro do clube, e revoltou a todos com suas decisões e polêmicas. Atualmente, o executivo pode sofrer um processo de impeachment.\nCitou a Gaviões da Fiel Mário Gobbi, ex-presidente do Corinthians, é completamente a favor da saída de Augusto do comando político do Timão. Porém, Mário envolveu a torcida organizada Gaviões da Fiel em suas falas.\n“ Os Gaviões foram coerentes com a manifestação deles. Eles lançaram o Augusto, eles apoiaram o Augusto, eles trabalharam para o Augusto, eles elegeram o Augusto, e eles fazem parte da gestão do Augusto. Então, eles, por lealdade, têm que morrer abraçados com o Augusto até o final. Eles estão absolutamente corretos na posição deles “, disse.\nA principal organizada do Timão atualmente divulgou seu posicionamento, onde foi completamente contrária à saída de Augusto do poder, citando que este não é o momento correto para isso.\nPUBLICIDADE PUBLICIDADE\nAugusto deve:\nAugusto deve:\n0 PESSOAS JÁ VOTARAM\nPUBLICIDADE PUBLICIDADE Carta branca para investigações Apesar de não ser a favor do impeachment, a organizada concorda que investigações devem ser feitas: “ Estamos dando carta branca para as investigações, quem errou vai ter que pagar, mas desde que tenham provas. Não vamos aceitar impeachment sem provas. O momento é de união. Se quiserem se matar politicamente, se matem, mas com os Gaviões fiscalizando.

    "title": "US judge urges Biden to examine support for ‘plausible genocide’ in Gaza",
    "text": "A United States federal court has dismissed\na case accusing President Joe Biden and other senior US officials of being complicit in Israel’s alleged genocide in Gaza.\nStill, the court’s decision (\nUS District Court Judge Jeffrey White dismissed the case on procedural grounds late on Wednesday, citing the division of powers under the US Constitution. He said in his decision that “disputes over foreign policy are considered nonjusticiable political questions” and fall outside his jurisdiction.\n“There are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the Court. This is one of those cases. The Court is bound by precedent and the division of our coordinate branches of government to abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this matter,” he wrote.\nBut White added that, as the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) said in a provisional ruling last month, “it is plausible that Israel’s conduct amounts to genocide.”\n“This Court implores Defendants to examine the results of their unflagging support of the military siege against the Palestinians in Gaza.”\nThe lawsuit came as the Biden administration has faced mounting pressure to end the US’s unwavering support for Israel amid its war on Gaza, which has\nkilled more than 27,000 Palestinians since early October.\nFiled late last year by human rights groups and individual Palestinians affected by the war, the complaint accused Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin of failing to fulfil their responsibilities under international and domestic law to prevent genocide.\nThe US, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid annually, was obligated to “exercise its clear and considerable influence on Israel”, the lawsuit argued.\nIt also pointed to “dehumanising” remarks by senior Israeli officials, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, to illustrate an intent to pursue the “erasure and destruction of Palestinians”.\nWhile Israel has rejected the charge, international law experts have said the bombardment of Gaza and restrictions on the entry of water, food and other humanitarian supplies could amount to genocide.\nThe 1948 Genocide Convention, which the US ratified, states that “genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which [state parties] undertake to\nprevent and to punish”. It also outlines that “complicity in genocide” is a punishable act.\n‘End deadly course of action’\nKatherine Gallagher, senior staff lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), a nonprofit involved in the case, said the judge’s ruling “affirmed that what the Palestinian population in Gaza is enduring is a campaign to eradicate a whole people — genocide”.\nThe decision, Gallagher said in a\nstatement, also affirmed “that the United States’ unflagging support for Israel is enabling the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the famine facing millions”.\n“While we strongly disagree with the court’s ultimate jurisdictional ruling, we urge the Biden administration to heed the judge’s call to examine and end its deadly course of action. Together with our plaintiffs, we will pursue all legal avenues to stop the genocide and save Palestinian lives.”\nThe Biden administration, which is under widespread pressure over its\nstaunch support for Israel, called for the lawsuit to be thrown out.\nIn December, government lawyers argued that the court was being asked to “intrude into areas committed to the political branches of the government and violate constitutional separation of powers”.\nThe\n[@theCCR]team knew this going in so the outcome (dismissed for PQD) is not surprising. What’s more significant re outcome is that Palestinians shared their story & compelled judge to note that the “facts are indisputable” & plausibly demonstrate Israel is committing [#genocide].\n— Noura Erakat (@4noura)\n[February 1, 2024]\nDespite Wednesday’s decision, the plaintiffs and their supporters said the court’s decision to\nhear their arguments marked an important step. A hearing was held last Friday in California, and Palestinians testified about the dire situation in Gaza.\n“It is important that the court recognized the United States is providing unconditional support to Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza and that a federal court heard Palestinian voices for the first time,” Mohammed Monadel Herzallah, a Palestinian American with family in Gaza, said in the CCR statement. He was one of the plaintiffs in the case.\n“But we are still devastated that the court would not take the important step to stop the Biden administration from continuing to support the slaughter of the Palestinian people,” Herzallah continued.\n“Currently, my family lacks food, medicine and the most basic necessities for survival. As Palestinians, we know this is a hard struggle, and as plaintiffs, we will continue to do everything in our power to save our people’s lives.”\nThe post\nUS judge urges Biden to examine support for ‘plausible genocide’ in Gaza appeared first on Al Jazeera.",
