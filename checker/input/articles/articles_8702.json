    "text": "France ambassador Jean-Baptiste Faivre Qatar and France have deepened their strategic partnership with a renewed focus on co-operation, marked by high-level diplomacy and joint efforts to address global challenges, French ambassador Jean-Baptiste Faivre has said. Speaking at a press briefing marking French National Day, the ambassador highlighted the two countries’ close collaboration, particularly in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. “France is supporting Qatar’s efforts to secure the release of all hostages, achieve an immediate and sustainable ceasefire, and ultimately lead to a political solution,” Faivre said. This support, he noted, translates into concrete actions, including joint humanitarian initiatives such as the delivery of medicine and ambulances to Gaza, along with a $200 million contribution for the Palestinian population. Faivre stressed that the close diplomatic consultation between Qatar and France is evident in the round-the-clock communication between officials from both countries. He underlined the importance of such a collaborative approach which goes beyond the Gaza conflict, extending to critical situations like the war in Ukraine, where the security of Europe hangs in the balance. The ambassador lauded Qatar’s participation in the Summit of Peace in June in Switzerland and its successful mediation efforts in returning Ukrainian children to their families. In addition, both countries are committed to supporting Lebanon in its efforts to regain stability and unity. “We are also very grateful to Qatar for its position based I would say under the key principles of international law, respect of sovereignty of state which is very important to France and to Qatar,” he said. Faivre cited the exceptional number of high-level visits between the two countries in recent years, including four visits by the French President to Doha and three visits by His Highness the Amir to France. These exchanges, he said, have culminated in two strategic dialogues, with a third planned for the coming months in Paris. “I think the best reflection of the renewed strength of the strategic partnership between France and Qatar was His Highness’ State visit to France last February. It was the first State visit in 15 years. A State visit is a great mark of friendship and trust,” he stressed. Beyond diplomacy, Faivre said such partnership covers economic and investment collaborations, with cross-investments in both countries benefiting from their respective economic strategies. The focus is on key sectors like energy transition, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and health. Bilateral trade between France and Qatar reached over €6.4 billion during 2022-2023. He also acknowledged France’s recent democratic elections, highlighting the high voter turnout and the importance of debate within French society. Faivre said France will also host the 19th Francophonie Summit in October, and Qatar’s participation is expected. This event, he added, signifies the commitment to cooperation and shared values between the two nations.",

    "title": "Biden’s Pre-debate Poll Numbers Sag, Trump Leads Nationally, in Battleground States",
    "text": "Heading into tonight’s debate with GOP candidate and former President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden received some bad news. Trump has expanded his lead in the national election polls as well as some battleground states that could decide the election, the Real Clear Politics Average of election polls shows. Though Biden has pared Trump’s lead in some states, Trump still leads by handy margins. A Trump victory in tonight’s debate, when Americans get a good look at the aging, infirm president in action, might seal a win in November. The Numbers Perhaps the biggest stunner for Biden is the latest New York Times-Siena poll [that put](https://web.archive.org/web/20240627011000/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/politics/trump-poll-hush-money-conviction.html) Trump four points ahead, 48-44, among likely voters. And for registered voters, Trump came out six points ahead, 48-42. Those numbers followed another bad survey for Biden. A recent Quinnipiac survey also put Trump four points ahead, 49-45. A recent Rasmussen poll has Trump clobbering Biden by nine points, 49-40. Those numbers, plus the RCP average, are bad news for Biden, who voters increasingly perceive as unable to do his job. The RCP average of general election polls gives Trump a 1.5-point lead, 46.6-45.1. Trump has prevailed in 10 of the last 20 polls with four ties. Numbers aside, the Times-Siena poll revealed that Biden is a weak candidate, even among Democrat supporters. “Voters overall say they now trust Mr. Trump more on the issues that matter most to them,” the [Times reported](https://web.archive.org/web/20240627011000/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/politics/trump-poll-hush-money-conviction.html). As well, Democrats voters are much more reluctant to embrace Biden as their man than Republicans are to embrace Trump. Age is another issue, the Times survey showed. “Age remains a clear challenge for Mr. Biden, 81, even though Mr. Trump, 78, would also be the oldest president ever to serve if he wins,” the [Times continued](https://web.archive.org/web/20240627011000/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/us/politics/trump-poll-hush-money-conviction.html): Roughly 70 percent of voters view Mr. Biden as too old to be effective, including a majority of Biden voters. Those figures are virtually unchanged since April. “He’s done good things in the past, but he’s too old,” Philip Hopkins, 78, a retired Democrat living in Peoria, Ariz., said of Mr. Biden. Mr. Hopkins said he worried that the president’s age might result in a loss to Mr. Trump. “That age thing, that could cost us our freedom,” he said. “It could cost us the destruction of our country.” In contrast, only about 40 percent of voters view Mr. Trump as too old. Swing State Trouble, Job Approval Significantly, Trump has increased his lead in some swing states, the RCP average shows. [Trump has expanded](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/arizona/trump-vs-biden) his lead in Arizona by a full point, from 4.6 percent to 5.6. Likewise, [he’s up](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/north-carolina/trump-vs-biden) a half-point in North Carolina, from 5.3 to 5.8. [Trump also widened](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-biden) his margin in all-important Pennsylvania from 2.3 to 2.8. Though Trump lost ground in Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan, he’s still ahead in all but Wisconsin, where he and Biden are tied. Biden’s job approval is in the tank: 56.1 percent of those polled think he’s doing a bad job. That number is even worse when broken down by issues. A whopping 60.2 percent of those polled disapprove of his immigration policies, which include inviting an invasion of penniless, illiterate Third World “migrants.” Another [59.5 percent disapprove](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/foreign-policy) of Biden’s foreign policy, while [61 percent think](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/joe-biden/inflation) he is mishandling inflation. Given those numbers, no wonder [64.9 percent of those surveyed](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/state-of-the-union/direction-of-country) think the country is headed in the wrong direction. On every front, voters tell pollsters, Biden has failed, and miserably so. Tonight’s Debate Tonight’s debate might be Biden’s only chance to turn around what appears to be a certain loss in November. The problem for Biden: His age, and the time of the debate — 9:00 p.m. Given Biden’s [advancing dementia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/expert-answers/sundowning/faq-20058511), he might well be [sundowning](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/expert-answers/sundowning/faq-20058511) by that time. Sundowning, late afternoon-evening anger and confusion, is a common symptom among those suffering with dementia. Biden’s puppet masters must be terrified that he might serve up some false memories about his past as a [civil rights leader](https://thenewamerican.com/us/politics/biden-falsely-claims-civil-rights-activism-again-false-memories-a-symptom-of-dementia-could-be-the-reason/) or [long-haul truck driver](https://thenewamerican.com/us/politics/bidens-cognitive-slide-shows-again-white-house-struggles-to-back-truck-driving-claim/). Or perhaps, noting that Trump threatens democracy, he might regale the nation with a tale about his Uncle Bosie, who died while defending democracy in the South Pacific and was [eaten by cannibals](https://thenewamerican.com/us/papua-new-guinea-pm-mad-about-bidens-false-memory-that-cannibals-ate-ww2-aviator-uncle/) on New Guinea. Worse, given what has occurred at the recent G7 meeting in Italy and other public events, he might well not know where he is. Speaking on The View to promote his new book, Bill Maher explained that Biden is, well, old. Biden “presents as old,” he said: It’s not really fair, because he’s almost the same age — Trump is almost the same age as him but Trump doesn’t present that way. You look at somebody, you can kind of just sum them up.… I saw him yesterday making that speech. I mean, I’m sorry, he’s cadaver-like. Voters think so, too. [A recent poll showed](https://thenewamerican.com/us/politics/election-shocker-third-poll-shows-biden-trump-tied-in-blue-virginia-voters-polled-think-biden-will-forget-where-he-is-during-debate/) that 49 percent expect Biden to forget where he is, 41 percent expect him to walk off the wrong side of the stage, and 40 percent expect him to have problems standing up. But he can’t be “cadaver-like” tonight, particularly next to Trump, who is alert, strong, vigorous, and seemingly ready for anything, even at 78 years old. One possible problem for Trump would be appearing to pick on an old, infirm man.",

    "text": "Las temperaturas asfixiantes provocan la muerte de cuatro personas en Salamanca\nLa mayoría de los fallecidos tenía más de 75 años, según la atribución realizada por el Instituto Carlos III\nLa primera ola de calor del verano sumado a las altas temperaturas ha tenido su reflejo en el sistema de monitorización de la mortalidad diaria (MoMo). Desde el inicio del mes de junio, el Instituto Carlos III señala que se han registrado cuatro muertes en la provincia de Salamanca relacionadas con el calor extremo. En todos los casos, tal y como refleja esta estadística que comenzó a aplicarse de forma masiva en la pandemia, se ha dado en personas mayores: tres de ellas superaban los 85 años y una que se encontraba entre los 75 y los 84.\nPrecisamente, tanto a esta franja de edad como a los niños y a los pluripatológicos son a los que se dirigen los consejos de los profesionales de la salud para evitar que se descompensen las patologías previas con las altas temperaturas. Los fallecimientos por el calor se concentran entre los días 27 y 1 de julio, fechas en la que se han superado los 37 grados centígrados durante cinco días consecutivos.\nLa llegada de las masas de aire caliente ha obligado a activar el aviso amarillo por parte de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología desde el viernes pasado en que arrancó la peligrosa ola de calor. Salamanca se mantendrá al menos hasta el viernes marcado por este color debido a temperaturas que oscilarán entre los 36 y los 37 grados previstos para mañana. En el día de ayer se alcanzaron en la capital los 35,5 grados y unas mínimas de 19,3 grados que se quedaron muy cerca de la calificación de 'noche tropical'.\nFuentes hospitalarias señalan que por el momento no se han producido golpes de calor en el servicio de Urgencias. En el momento que se producen casos de este tipo son de declaración obligatoria. Donde sí ha habido casos ha sido en el servicio de Medicina Interna donde han tenido que asistir e ingresar a personas mayores o pluripatológicas que se han visto descompensadas por el exceso de temperaturas. Desde los centros de salud tampoco se han recibido un incremento de atenciones por el exceso de temperatura.\nPese a la multitud de avisos que se producen durante el verano, lo cierto es que el frío polar causa en Salamanca el triple de muertes que el excesivo calor. Si se tienen en cuenta los datos del año pasado, el Instituto Carlos III atribuye casi un centenar de decesos a las bajas temperaturas, casi el triple que las que se registraron durante el periodo estival el pasado año.\nCampaña de Cruz Roja en los parques y pueblos\nCon la llegada de nuevas olas de calor a la provincia, Cruz Roja en Salamanca ha reforzado sus acciones para prevenir los efectos negativos de las altas temperaturas sobre la salud, especialmente entre los colectivos más vulnerables. Bajo el lema «En guardia contra el calor», la organización ha desplegado un amplio dispositivo de sensibilización y prevención en espacios públicos y localidades de la provincia, con actividades que se mantendrán durante todo el verano.\nLa campaña comenzó esta semana en el parque de La Alamedilla, donde personal técnico y voluntariado de Cruz Roja han ofrecido consejos a la ciudadanía, repartido trípticos informativos, botellas de agua, abanicos y protección solar, además de realizar catas de agua para promover la hidratación. Durante los meses de julio y agosto, esta misma actividad se trasladará a otros parques de la ciudad como Würzburg y Jesuitas, así como a municipios como Vitigudino, Peñaranda de Bracamonte, Ciudad Rodrigo, Béjar, Tamames y Santa Marta de Tormes.",

    "text": "The Spirit of Peace Lutheran Church in Milwaukee has officially decided to close its doors.\nLeaders with the LGBTQ+ affirming congregation say they were unable to fully recover from the pandemic. Their last service will be this weekend.\nSpirit of the Peace was known to be as inclusive as churches come. TMJ4's Sydni Eure says she felt that welcome as soon as she shook Pastor Michael McAllister's hand.\nThe church has hosted a Lutheran congregation for more than a hundred years, but it became Spirit of Peace Lutheran Church in 2014. Inclusivity has become a major part of the church's mission, from welcoming members of the LGBTQ+ community to meeting people through the food pantry they've operated for years. Pastor McAllister says all walks of life worship at Spirit of Peace.\nHe says it'll be bittersweet to say goodbye, but a legacy will live on.\n\"The love and the faithful service and worship that we've done in this place will live on,\" McAllister says. \"It will live on through us and the other ministries we will continue to support and that's something important to realize and remember.\"\nMcAllister says the congregation will find other churches to call home.

    "text": "The documentary, currently titled 'David Attenborough: Ocean\" will premiere in 2025\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- How healthy are our world's oceans? National Geographic and renowned natural historian David Attenborough are teaming up to produce a feature-length documentary to look at just that.\nCurrently titled \"David Attenborough: Oceans,\" the documentary will take a closer look at our interconnected waters and what we all can do to keep them healthy. It's the first time the two have partnered for a project.\nIn a statement, Attenborough said, \"My lifetime has coincided with the great age of ocean discovery. Over the last hundred years, scientists and explorers have revealed remarkable new species, epic migrations and dazzling, complex ecosystems beyond anything I could have imagined as a young man. In this film, we share those wonderful discoveries, uncover why our ocean is in such poor health, and, perhaps most importantly, show how it can bounce back to life.\"\nTom McDonald, National Geographic's executive vice president of Global Factual and Unscripted Content, had this to say about working with Attenborough, \"There is no one better to deliver this landmark film than Sir David. I have had the privilege and pleasure of working with him many times over the past decade, and so I am, of course, personally and professionally thrilled that he has agreed to work with National Geographic for the very first time on a subject that is timely and close to his heart.\"\n\"David Attenborough: Oceans\" will premiere in 2025 in theaters, then will air on National Geographic and stream on Disney+ and Hulu.\nThe Walt Disney Company is the parent company of National Geographic, Disney+, Hulu and this ABC station.",
