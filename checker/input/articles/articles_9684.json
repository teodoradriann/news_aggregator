    "text": "Zero Carbon Certification for Chadstone Place Chadstone Place in Melbourne’s Chadstone Shopping Centre is believed to be the first Australian office building to achieve Zero Carbon Certification from the International Living Future Institute.\nThe fully electric building also achieved a 6 Star Green Star Design and a 6 Star Green Star Design and As Built certification and is targeting a 5.5 NABERS Energy rating.\nVicinity, the building’s owner, chose to retrofit the existing property rather than rebuild, leading to an estimated reduction of 85 per cent in embodied carbon.\nThis also saw 88 per cent of the building’s net lettable area could be reused and 90 per cent of all construction waste was diverted from landfill.\nNew tenant Officeworks, which aims for 100 per cent renewable energy by 2025 and net zero emissions by 2030, was approached by Vicinity to create an office space that would meet those requirements and set a new benchmark for green commercial buildings.\nVicinity’s national head of design, David Waldren, said the achievement shows that “the greenest buildings can be the ones that already exist.\n“This project is a bricks-and-mortar example of a building that meets the Paris Agreement goals of net zero emissions and moves us closer to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, embracing circular economy principles and delivers exceptional places for people.”\nAsian countries are cracking down on plastic. Malaysia has flagged new extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws, which will make producers pay for the management of end-of-life waste instead of cash-strapped local governments.\nExperts have raised questions over the effectiveness of the law, pointing to the Philippines, which enacted similar laws two years ago but needed help to get large enterprises to comply due to the unclear guidelines. Similar struggles can be seen in other Asian countries, such as Singapore, which has a deposit refund system for plastic bottles caught in delays. Vietnam received complaints about the exorbitant recycling fee.\nBusan in South Korea will follow in Malaysia’s footsteps with a landmark decision to finalise next month.\nWollemi Capital joins bid on low carbon cement Australian climate investment firm Wollemi Capital has joined several US investors in backing Californian based materials technology company Fortera in a Series C USD$85 million funding round.\nThe company has developed technology that reduces carbon dioxide in making cement by intercepting carbon dioxide exhaust from kilns and permanently sequestering it by mineralising the CO2 into ready-to-use cement. This cement can then be blended back into any non-green cement produced by the original plant.\nThe company claims the process lowers emissions by 70 per cent compared to ordinary cement on a ton-for-ton basis. The technology is currently under trial at ReCarb, the first full-scale plant in Redding, California, with a “bolt-on” cement plant, which can capture 6,600 tons of carbon dioxide annually and produce 15,000 tons of green cement.\nWollemi Capital says the US company did what all “previous cement technologies have failed to do”: to provide a solution for a cleaner industry.\nWhy are office buildings not being retrofitted? Why can’t we just turn these empty office buildings into housing? Here’s a fun clip tackling this very serious topic from former chief urban designer of The City of New York, Alexandros Washburn, answering this age old question:",

    "text": "Tras el deceso del productor Guillermo del Bosque debido a una enfermedad terminal, muchos internautas buscan dar una explicación a su fallecimiento por lo que de forma temeraria hasta se habla, el mal que aquejó al creativo fue obra de una brujería.\nY usuarios están relacionando con supuestas pruebas a la comediante Karla Panini con el deceso de Del Bosque, ya que dicen, es una coincidencia que él también haya fallecido de un cáncer incurable, tal como en su momento lo hizo Karla Luna, examiga de la rubia luminaria.\nEn un tuit incluso se puede ver el trabajo realizado tiempo atrás hacia 'Memo' y Karla Luna, cuya tercia de personalidades fueron unidas cuando Del Bosque fue productor del programa Guerra de Chistes, emisión que tuvo varias veces invitadas a quienes fueran el dúo de Las Lavanderas.\nLee también: Hallan tres cadáveres dentro de un auto robado en Cuautitlán Izcalli\nSobre este supuesto maleficio hecho por Panini, el payaso Platanito, quien fuera muy cercana al par de humoristas contó su verdad sobre la brujería hacia el productor.\n“Desconozco si le hicieron algo, pero no creo en eso. Memo, siendo tan creyente, tampoco lo habría creído. Memo se fue por una enfermedad. Mi mamá también tiene cáncer y no se lo atribuyo a rituales ni energías oscuras. Es una enfermedad que llega”, indicó a la revista TVNotas.\nLo que sí renuncia hecho contado de propia voz del creativo, es que una vez tuvo una experiencia sobrenatural, hecho que contó a su gran amigo Jorge 'El Burro' Van Rankin.\nEn el programa del conductor mencionó que se encontraba en terapia intensiva cuando tuvo contacto con un ser sombrío, que al parecer no era de este plano de vida.\nCorría el año de 2019 cuando Memo realizó la impactante declaración.\n\"Yo estaba solo en mi cuarto y entra una señora toda de negro, con una pañoleta, tapada, alta como europea, pálida y me dice 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' [...] La señora me dijo '¿Ya estás listo?' y yo le dije 'Voy bien'. Para mí era como si fuera la muerte [...] me preguntó que, si necesitaba algo de ella, le avisara. Ya nunca más la volví a ver\", reveló Del Bosque a su entrañable amigo.",

    "title": "'He didn’t deserve this.’ Patient dies after being restrained in psych ward",
    "text": "By Heather Catallo ,\n37 minutes ago A local couple says they sent their son to a crisis center for help. But then they say he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital without their knowledge where he ended up dying while being restrained.\nThe feds recently told Pontiac General Hospital that they’re terminating their CMS contract. Without a contract, the hospital can no longer bill Medicare and Medicaid.\nOne part of the federal government’s decision to intervene was because of the death of Ryan White, a 41-year-old from Milford whose parents say was just trying to get some help from the mental health system.\nFriends and family describe White as a gentle giant who loved to create art, loved to grill, and loved to have fun.\nHe was the center of his parent’s world.\n“He was a really good person. He was a sweet guy,” said Margo White, Ryan’s mother. “It's just heartbreaking. I wake up crying. I can't go to sleep because I'm sitting out here looking at his picture crying.”\nNow Margo and Tom White want to know why their only son is dead. They also say they want to know why hospital video shows a crowd of medical personnel watching as their son stops breathing.\n“He didn't deserve this. It should have never happened. He did not deserve this,” said Margo.\nThe Whites say Ryan struggled with schizophrenia for the last two decades.\n“When he was on his medication, he was golden. He got off that medication… He couldn't even think straight,” said Margo.\nLast April, Tom says he could tell Ryan was becoming more paranoid. Tom and Margo are Ryan’s legal guardians, so Tom took his son to Common Ground, a crisis center in Pontiac.\n“I called them before we went. I described what was going on with him. They said, ‘Hey, that's what we're here for. Bring him on down,’” said Tom.\nRyan’s records from Common Ground show he was there for 2 days and then the 41-year-old was sent involuntarily to Pontiac General Hospital.\n“Did they ever tell you they were transferring him?” asked 7 Investigator Heather Catallo.\n“No, no, no. I didn't know he was at Pontiac General,” said Tom. “I got a call in the morning… Pontiac General told me he went into cardiac arrest. And I said, ‘well, is he okay?’ And she said, ‘I can't tell you.’”\nThe Whites say Ryan was far from OK: Ryan had died.\n“You shouldn't have to bury your own children,” said Tom.\nTom and Margo say at first, they did not know all of the details about Ryan’s death.\n“I didn't know what happened until I saw your report about the person having the knee and the elbow and just - on top of them,” said Margo.\nLast month, the 7 Investigators revealed a report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). That report listed the death of a patient in restraints as a key factor in terminating Pontiac General’s CMS contracts, which means the privately-owned psychiatric center can no longer accept Medicare or Medicaid. Records show that patient was Ryan White, and now the 7 Investigators have obtained video of the hospital response when Ryan stopped breathing.\n“That's just appalling to me,” said Margo. “My mind just always goes back to his last few minutes of life.”\nRyan had only been at Pontiac General Hospital about 8 hours on April 4, 2024. When he emerged from his room, staff said in police and CMS records that Ryan was agitated and started swinging at staff and patients.\nThe video shows a mental health technician holding Ryan’s door shut for 20 seconds. Once he emerges, staff restrain him and Ryan falls to the floor.\nCMS records show staff are not allowed to place a patient face down during restraints, but video and federal records reveal Ryan was kept down with staff “straddling” Ryan and using a knee and elbow to hold him down.\nAccording to records, Ryan had stopped breathing.\nLISTEN: 911 call from Pontiac General Hospital\nLISTEN: 911 call from Pontiac General Hospital The video shows a nurse start doing chest compressions, all while a crowd filled with psychiatrists, attending physicians, and other medical personnel watch, talk to each other, and make phone calls. At one point, 18 people can be counted in the area. CMS records point out, \"Multiple staff were noted in the immediate area without participation in the code.\"\nFederal records show no one finds a crash cart for the patient for 2 full minutes. The CMS investigators also noted in documents that the video shows a defibrillator was not accessed until 13 minutes after Ryan stopped moving.\nAnd according to those records, Pontiac General’s Director of Nursing admitted to federal investigators “the defibrillator was not used.”\n“How can a hospital not have the ability to respond to a patient first in crisis and then having an obvious cardiac event?” said attorney Marc Lipton, who represents the White family.\n“The cause of death is positional asphyxia, which basically means he was strangled to death,” said Lipton. “Ryan was at this place for help. He was there in crisis. This was their job. They have a job to do, to care for people like Ryan.”\nThe medical examiner said the manner of Ryan White’s death was an accident, but his parents say they disagree.\n“That shouldn't be allowed to happen,” said Tom. “As a father, you always feel like you should protect your child… I'll never forgive myself for turning him over to those people.”\nAfter the 7 Investigators first story on this death aired in November, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office asked the prosecutor to review this to see if a crime was committed.\nThe 7 Investigators reached out to both Pontiac General Hospital and Common Ground.\nA spokesperson for Common Ground said due to health privacy issues they are not able to answer any questions.\nThe 7 Investigators have tried reaching the owners of the hospital by phone, email and text. So far they have not responded, nor has their attorney.\nIf you have a story for Heather Catallo, please email her at hcatallo@wxyz.com or call 248-8274473.",

On a fait circuler des mensonges sur moi.

Il s’est défendu, en évoquant un « lapsus », expliquant qu’il dénonçait les rivalités entre supporteurs du Maghreb , lors de la Coupe d'Afrique des Nations (CAN) de football.\n« Ce sont des mensonges » Mais les propos qui lui sont reprochés couvriraient un champ bien plus large encore, selon l’arrêté d’expulsion, consulté par l’AFP : il est accusé d’avoir véhiculé « une conception littérale, rétrograde, intolérante et violente de l’ Islam , de nature à encourager des comportements contraires aux valeurs de la République », sur les femmes ou les Juifs.\nA BFM TV, Mahjoub Mahjoubi a assuré qu’il n’avait « en aucun cas » dit que « les Juifs étaient l’ennemi », ou véhiculé des p(...)

    "text": "Interfaith greetings are part of our commitment to live in harmony without compromising our faith.Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Religious Affairs Ministry has said that offering interfaith greetings is a good practice to maintain religious harmony, and their use must not be discouraged. The ministry's director general of Islamic community guidance, Kamaruddin Amin, said that interfaith greetings have become a medium to propagate peace, which is taught in every religion, and enhance relations between people from different religions. \"Interfaith greetings is a good practice for religious harmony. It is not an attempt to syncretize religious doctrine. The people know that one's faith is the matter of each individual and, sociologically, interfaith greetings strengthen harmony and tolerance,\" Amin said, according to a statement issued here on Friday. Such greetings are commonly conveyed by residents while starting their remarks at public events or meetings. The greetings of Indonesia's six religions are usually started with the Islamic greeting Assalamualaikum. However, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has discouraged the practice and, during the recent VIII National Fatwa Commission Ulema Meeting, declared it haram (forbidden) for Muslims. Amin said that in a multicultural nation-state like Indonesia, the expression of diversity must reflect social flexibility while remaining within the limits set by religious teachings. Religious greetings are also an effective form of social communication to improve religious harmony in Indonesia. \"Interfaith greetings are part of our commitment to live in harmony without compromising our faith,\" he said. Efforts to maintain religious harmony must also be made by strengthening cohesion instead of restricting oneself, which could end in segregation, he explained. \"Our work to maintain harmony has been successful. The good practice among residents helped increase our religious harmony index,\" Amin said. The ministry official noted that Indonesia's religious harmony index has increased three years in a row, from 72.39 in 2021 to 73.09 in 2022 and 73.09 in 2023. \"We need to be flexible and thoughtful in practicing our religion to realize synergy between religious practices and national development,\" he said.

    "text": "Tomate y choclo: cuánto y por qué bajarán sus precios\nEl alza de algunos productos de temporada se debió a diversos episodios meteorológicos.Por\nSthefania Díaz González\nEn las primeras semanas se presentó una baja en la oferta y un incremento en los precios de productos de temporada, especialmente en los de el choclo humero y el tomate.\nEl ministro de Agricultura, Esteban Valenzuela, explicó que los temporales de invierno del año pasado atrasaron las cosechas de ambos productos y, como consecuencia, su costo subió durante enero.\nA pesar de esto, aseguró que sus precios comenzarán a disminuir desde febrero.\nLa Oficina de Estudios y Políticas Agrarias (ODEPA) del Ministerio de Agricultura dio cuenta que al finalizar la tercera semana del año se detectaron cosechas de tomate atrasadas, principalmente en la Región del Maule, debido a las lluvias.\n“Muchas zonas tomateras estuvieron anegadas, por lo que los cultivos están corridos dos o tres semanas de las temporadas normales” afirmó el ministro. Así mismo, dijo que su precio volverá a situarse en torno a los $1.000, incluso menos, aun que esta quincena estará a $1.500\nA día de hoy, su valor va desde los $788 el kilo, en Arica, hasta los $1.950, en la Región de Los Lagos. Todo esto considerando ferias y supermercados.\nPor otro lado, en la Región Metropolitana los precios varían entre los $1.500 y $1.890.\n“Bueno, La Vega en esto está siendo muy generosa en los valores. También hay que pensar en el precio justo para los productores, no podemos esperar que productos tan importantes estén a cien pesos” agregó.\nEl Ministerio de Agricultura por su parte publicó en su cuenta de\nX que Arturo Guerrero y Esteban Valenzuela se encontraban en La Vega. “Observando precios y viendo los mejores alimentos de la temporada” dice el tweet.\nArturo Guerrero, relacionador público de La Vega, explicó que “inevitablemente el 2 de enero, porque venimos del año nuevo, es una fecha en que el campo no se trabaja“. En relación a la alza de los precios no solo del choclo y el tomate fueron afectados, sino también el limón.\nA pesar de esto, desde el ministerio indicaron que, considerando su período de cosecha más tarde de lo normal, el choclo aumentó su presencia en las estanterías de supermercados en un 30%.\n“Donde comenzó a salir en grandes cantidades, está a $400” agregó Arturo Guerrero .\nLéenos en",

    "text": "Amid speculation whether she will participate in the inauguration of Ram mandir in Ayodhya, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday came down heavily on the BJP for mixing religion and politics.\nMs. Banerjee, however, remained non-committal on the question whether she will participate in the inauguration of the temple or not. “You people seem to know everything. I know nothing,” the Trinamool Congress chairperson said when asked about whether she will be participating in the event or not. Sources in the Trinamool Congress have, however, said the Chief Minister might give the event a miss.\nAccusing the BJP of playing the card of religion before every election, Ms. Banerjee, addressing a gathering in State’s North 24 Parganas, said, “Following religion is an individual’s affair. But a festival involves all, irrespective of their religious belief. Before every election, they [BJP] play the card of religion”.\nThe Trinamool Congress in its 12-year-old regime has not hesitated from promoting religion and mixing it with politics. Not only does the West Bengal government under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee provide financial allocation to community Durga Pujas, the State government is working for renovation of key temples at Kalighat, Dakhineshwar and Tarakeshwar. The State government through the Wakf Board provides honorarium to Imams and Muezzins.\nFree food grains While addressing the gathering at Deganga on Thursday, the Chief Minister also criticised the BJP’s promise of free food grains to the majority of country’s population and said her government had been doing it from the very start.\nReiterating that she will not allow the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in West Bengal, Ms. Banerjee said, “All of you are citizens of this country. CAA will not be allowed in Bengal. If you face any problem related to your citizenship, the concerned district magistrates will take care of it.” The Chief Minister told the gathering that everyone is a citizen.\n‘You all are citizens of this country. If not, how are you getting the ration every day? How did you get PAN cards, Aadhaar cards or voter cards? All this is a bluff,” Ms. Banerjee said.\nShe also asserted that the Trinamool Congress would spearhead the fight against the BJP in West Bengal in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls and alleged that the Congress and the CPI(M) have an understanding with the BJP in the State.\n“The CPI(M), BJP, and the Congress have forged an alliance in West Bengal and are actively campaigning against us. The INDIA opposition alliance will confront the saffron camp nationwide, with the TMC spearheading the battle against the BJP in West Bengal,” Ms. Banerjee said.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",
