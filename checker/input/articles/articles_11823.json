    "text": "El Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología (Senamhi) informó que la costa centro y sur del Perú presentará incremento de la temperatura diurna desde hoy hasta el domingo 20 de octubre.\nExplicó que estas condiciones se deben al debilitamiento y alejamiento del Anticiclón del Pacífico Sur, lo que generará el atenuamiento de los vientos del sur, y por ende mayor frecuencia de vientos cálidos del norte.\nDichas condiciones aumentan la probabilidad de que la nubosidad se disipe con mayor facilidad, especialmente hacia el mediodía. Asimismo, no se descarta la presencia de niebla/neblina principalmente en horas de la madrugada en los distritos cercanos al litoral.\nSegún el Senamhi, en el departamento de La Libertad se tendrían temperaturas entre 22 °C y 28 °C, mientras que en Áncash se presentarían valores entre los 21 °C y 27 °C.\nAsimismo, en Lima región se alcanzarían valores entre 19 °C y 27 °C, en tanto que en Ica se registrarán temperaturas máximas entre 22 °C y 35 °C.\nPor otro lado, en Arequipa, Moquegua y Tacna se estiman temperaturas diurnas entre 22 °C y 26 °C.\nFinalmente, en Lima metropolitana se esperan valores entre los 21 °C y 23 °C en distritos próximos al litoral costero. En los distritos alejados de la costa de Lima metropolitana se prevén temperaturas máximas entre los 24 °C y próximos a los 26 °C.\n(FIN) NDP/LZD\nTambién en Andina:\nVientos de hasta 45 kilómetros por hora (km/h) soportará la sierra norte y centro desde hoy hasta el martes 15 de octubre, pronosticó el @Senamhiperu .\n?? https://t.co/OVbXcGwuXK pic.twitter.com/ny1aEejYX3\n— Agencia Andina (@Agencia_Andina) October 13, 2024",

    "text": "A handout picture by Venezuela's government shows President Nicolas Maduro (C) delivering a speech in Caracas before members of the country's armed forces on December 28, 2023 - Copyright Venezuelan Presidency/AFP Zurimar Campos Javier TOVAR, Esteban ROJAS Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday ordered more than 5,600 military personnel to participate in a “defensive” exercise near the border with Guyana, in response to Britain sending a warship to the area.\nMaduro said he was launching “a joint action of a defensive nature in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against peace and the sovereignty of our country.”\nBritain said Sunday it would divert the patrol vessel HMS Trent to Guyana, a former British colony, amid the South American country’s simmering territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela over the oil-rich Essequibo region.\nA Guyana foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that the ship was due to arrive Friday and would be in its territory for “less than a week” for open sea defense exercises. The ship will not dock in Georgetown.\nThe television broadcast accompanying Maduro’s announcement showed fighter jets participating in the Venezuelan exercise, as well as ships and ocean patrol vessels.\nThe Venezuelan government earlier asked Guyana, in a statement, “to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the HMS Trent, and to refrain from involving military powers in the territorial controversy.”\nGuyana’s vice president Bharrat Jagdeo said the country was not doing anything to threaten Venezuela.\n“A lot of these measures were long-planned and they are routine and they are part of our building a defensive capability,” he told a press conference.\n“We don’t plan on invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and he need not have any worry about that.”\n– ‘We are warriors’ –\nMaduro claims that Essequibo — which makes up about two-thirds of Guyana’s territory — is actually Venezuelan land, a decades-old contention that has flared since massive oil deposits were found in its waters.\nThe rising tensions have raised fears in the region of a potential conflict over the remote area of 160,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles).\nThe South American neighbors agreed earlier this month not to resort to force to settle the dispute, during a meeting between Maduro and Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali.\n“We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue, in peace,” said Maduro.\n“But no one should threaten Venezuela, no one should mess with Venezuela. We are a people of peace, but we are warriors and this threat is unacceptable for any sovereign country,” he said.\n“The threat of the decadent, rotten, ex-empire of the United Kingdom is unacceptable.”\nA UK foreign minister, David Rutley, visited Guyana earlier this month and reiterated sovereign borders “must be respected” and that London would work internationally “to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld.”\nMaduro’s government held a controversial referendum on December 3 in which 95 percent of voters, according to officials in the hard-line leftist government, supported declaring Venezuela the rightful owner of Essequibo.\nHe has since started legal maneuvers to create a Venezuelan province in Essequibo and ordered the state oil company to issue licenses for extracting crude in the region.\nGuyana’s Ali has branded the moves a “grave threat to international peace and security.”",

(WLUC) - On Saturday with blizzard conditions, owners of one Marquette County store said they weren’t affected at all. Down Wind Sports in Marquette said they saw several customers in their store looking for last-minute items like boots, hats, and gloves on Saturday. Employees also said in the past during storms like this, they will see more traffic in the store. Co-owner Bill Thompson said the snow is what he and other Yoopers have been praying for. “People want snow, and they want to get out and so a lot of our customers are out on the woods today either cross-country skiing or snowshoeing,” Thompson said. “A lot of our customers are going out to the ski hill which just opened up and we are thankful for that so we are very excited to have this storm coming in,” Thompson also said now that the real winter has begun, he is hoping to see even more new customers in his store.

    "text": "Venlo, the Netherlands, Feb. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced two significant achievements in sustainability through recognitions by My Green Lab, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing sustainability in scientific research:\n- Two newly launched environmentally friendlier QIAwave nucleic-acid extraction kits have received the prestigious ACT Environmental Impact Factor Label, bringing the number of QIAGEN products with this recognition to eight. These new kits are the QIAwave RNA Plus Mini Kit and QIAwave DNA/RNA Mini Kit that are used in labs around the world.\nIn awarding the ACT (Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency) labels, My Green Lab found that the two new QIAwave products had an up to 27% improvement in the Environmental Impact Factor when compared to the respective QIAGEN standard kits.\n- QIAGEN’s R&D lab for Sample technologies at its European operational headquarters in Hilden, Germany, has achieved the Platinum certification level in a review by My Green Lab. This certification provides scientists and lab-supporting teams with actionable ways to make meaningful changes, reduce costs, preserve resources, and ensure a safe, healthy environment in support of science. QIAGEN has set a roadmap to have all of its Life Sciences labs at the Hilden site certified by My Green Lab.\n„My Green Lab puts the spotlight on companies to meet planet Earth’s immense ecological challenges head-on. We at QIAGEN take that challenge very seriously. The recognition of our eco-friendlier kits and the Platinum certification of our Sample technologies lab are proof points of our commitment to sustainability and important milestones in our campaign to significantly reduce the environmental impact of our entire product range,” said Nitin Sood, Senior Vice President and Head of QIAGEN’s Life Science Business Area.\nIn early 2023, QIAGEN’s emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the company committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. In 2022, the company surpassed its target for a 9% reduction in plastic usage with a 16.5% decrease. QIAGEN aims to reduce plastic packaging waste by a further 7% in 2023.\nQIAGEN’s commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices has been recognized by independent rating agencies such as ISS-ESG, which recently elevated QIAGEN’s rating to B-, reaffirming its „Prime“ status, and MSCI ESG Research, which gave QIAGEN a grade A. Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings placed the company in the low-risk group.\nMore information on QIAGEN’s sustainable products can be found here:\nhttps://www.qiagen.com/us/sustainability/environment/more-sustainable-products\nAbout QIAGEN\nQIAGEN N.V., a Netherlands-based holding company, is the leading global provider of Sample to Insight solutions that enable customers to gain valuable molecular insights from samples containing the building blocks of life.

Consumer demand has shifted more towards canned cocktails and nonalcoholic beers. Additionally, Generation Z consumes less alcohol than any other generation, favoring spirits like vodka and tequila over beer.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

    "text": "Dec. 15 marked a momentous and heartfelt reunion for combat medical specialist Sgt. Kate Cole. The Nebraska National Guard hero surprised her mother, Kris, during her shift as a nurse in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit at the local hospital Bryan Health, news outlet 1011 Now reported.\nDeployed to the Middle East in February, Sgt. Cole had been working firsthand with other medics and doctors to treat combat emergencies and stabilize wounded soldiers with the Charlie Troop 1-134 Cavalry Squadron for the post 10 months. On Dec. 7, the Nebraska native — and 90 of her fellow troops — earned a ticket home for the holidays.\nExplore Atlanta’s Ronald McDonald House is supporting local patients in a big way To surprise her mother, Sgt. Cole told Kris that her tour had been extended and that she consequently would not be coming home for the holidays. Then the combat medical specialist went into action, surprising her mother on the morning of Dec. 15 with a visit to the Bryan East Campus. They had not seen each other since Sgt. Cole’s deployment.\n“My mom has always been my biggest role model,” Sgt. Cole told 1011 Now. “She taught me how to be a caring and compassionate person and to always serve those around me. I’m so thankful and blessed to surprise her and be able to spend Christmas with her everyone here at home.”\nAccording to the Nebraska nurse, seeing her daughter at the end of her shift was a welcome surprise.\nExplore Emory School of Nursing takes to the fields for farmworkers in need “Nobody said a word to me about any of this,” Kris told 1011 Now. “I’m so surprised she is home! We were just starting to plan our family get together for Christmas. And now Kate will be with us. It’s been a stressful 10 months, but I know her whole unit is well trained and taken care of. I’m just so excited to have her back.”\nAbout the Author\nHunter Boyce Hunter Boyce is a writer, digital producer and journalist home grown from a Burke County, Georgia farm.
