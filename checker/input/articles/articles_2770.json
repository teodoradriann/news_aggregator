    "text": "“Iran is currently at its highest level of military readiness, and if the United States or the Zionist regime attempts any act of aggression, they will be caught by surprise,” the official, who did not wish to be named, told Press TV.\nThe security official downplayed recent US military repositioning in the region, calling it a defensive reaction to Iran’s warnings that it would target their regional interests and bases in case of any act of aggression in the country.\n“What the Americans are doing is not a message of threat to Iran, but rather a reaction to Iran’s threats against their interests,” he said.\nThe remarks come as the United States begins a partial evacuation of its personnel from the West Asia region. On Wednesday, the US State Department ordered the departure of non-emergency staff from its embassy in Baghdad and authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from bases in Bahrain, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed the move, saying, “They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place. We’ve given notice to move out, and we’ll see what happens.”\nUS officials cited heightened tensions in the region and intelligence suggesting that Israel may be preparing a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting fears of Iranian retaliation against American assets in the region.\nThe Iranian security official said the trove of secret Israeli documents Iran has recently obtained “has given Iran extensive intelligence superiority regarding the target bank of the United States and the Zionist regime.”\nHe pointed to recent advances in Iran’s military capabilities, including the successful test of a ballistic missile with a two-ton warhead, as announced by Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Nasirzadeh.\n“Iran is now capable of catching its enemies by surprise by launching deadly preemptive strikes before any hostile movement on their part,” the official said.\nThe contradicting messages coming out of Washington indicated that they have no “practical initiative on the battlefield” and therefore have resorted to psychological warfare, he added.\nOn Sunday, Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib of Iran confirmed that the materials, which include documents on Israel’s clandestine nuclear program and records of its nuclear plans and facilities, had been transferred under heavy secrecy to Iran and would be published soon.\nIn a statement on Monday, Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) said the country will hit Israel’s secret nuclear facilities if the regime carries out any act of aggression against the Islamic Republic.\nThe SNSC said the complex intelligence operation was part of Iran’s broader plan and covert acts to counter the enemies’ propaganda.\nMNA/",

    "title": "Montreal's forecast for the first weekend of spring: snow | CTV News",
    "text": "While winter tires are no longer mandatory in Quebec, you might want to think twice about removing them. A low pressure system moving into southwestern Quebec for the first weekend of spring is expected to bring accumulating snow. Light snow is expected to move into the Montreal area in the pre-dawn hours of Saturday. The city will be right on the edge of the steady snowfall, making predictions challenging, but five centimetres is likely, with up to 10 cm possible if the system tracks further west. Steadier snowfall is expected east of Montreal, and places like Sherbrooke could see upwards of 15 cm of accumulation. Environment and Climate Change Canada has issued special weather statements for the Eastern Townships and the Beauce, warning that snow could significantly impact road travel. The same system is expected to move into southern Ontario Friday. Parts of that province, including Toronto, are under a snowfall warning for up to 15 cm of accumulation. Toronto should brace for one of its biggest snowfalls of the year. Outside of the snowfall warning, there are travel advisories with five to 10 cm of accumulation expected. Montreal should see the snow come to an end by Saturday afternoon, but temperatures are expected to remain cold for the first half of the weekend. Sunshine should return by Sunday as the daytime high climbs back above the freezing mark. More typical spring-like weather is expected next week, with milder air and occasional showers.

    "text": "The Russo Brothers are hitting the road with their brand-new sci-fi film, The Electric State, which is powering up with a release date that's not too far away. Following the first trailer's release earlier today , it was revealed at New York Comic Con that the next project from the long-time Avengers directors will be streaming on Netflix starting March 14th, 2025. This places The Electric State on the same release date as Steven Soderbergh 's upcoming thriller Black Bag and the Amber Midthunder -starring action comedy Novocaine. Their first directorial feature film since 2022's The Gray Man, which starred Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans , The Electric State is very close to being the Russos' most-star-studded film since Avengers: Endgame . The two leads are fulfilled by Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown and Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt , who will play an unlikely pair of companions as they embark on a perilous road trip. The rest of the cast is nothing to scoff at either, as it also includes Loki star Ke Huy Quan, Seinfeld star Jason Alexander, The Hunger Games star Woody Harrelson, Captain America: Brave New World star Anthony Mackie , Succession star Brian Cox, Bob's Burgers star Jenny Slate, The Mandalorian star Giancarlo Esposito , and Citadel star Stanley Tucci . The official plot synopsis of The Electric State reads as follows:\"Set in the aftermath of a robot uprising in an alternate version of the ’90s, The Electric State follows an orphaned teenager who ventures across the American West with a cartoon-inspired robot, a smuggler, and his sidekick in search of her younger brother.\" The Russo Brothers Are Making Big Moves in the Movie World The Electric State, in large part thanks to its ambitious concept and phenomenal cast, is destined to be a big hit for both Netflix and the Russo Brothers. Following their widely praised work on Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War , the Russos brought the Infinity Saga of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a triumphant close with the jaw-dropping event that was Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. After initially saying they were retiring from Marvel movies after those films, the directing duo surprised everyone at the 2024 San Diego Comic Con by revealing they would be coming back to the MCU to take on Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars . The Russos are also producing a number of upcoming projects, including their ongoing Citadel saga and the upcoming A24 film, The Legend of Ochi . The Electric State premieres on Netflix on March 14th, 2024. Stay with Collider for the latest updates.",

    "text": "Imagens impressionantes que circulam nas redes sociais nesta quinta-feira (9), mostram aeronaves quase sendo totalmente cobertas pelas águas no [Aeroporto Internacional Salgado Filho](https://revistaforum.com.br/temas/aeroporto-56139.html), em [Porto Alegre](https://revistaforum.com.br/temas/porto-alegre-243.html), [Rio Grande do Sul](https://revistaforum.com.br/temas/rio-grande-do-sul-182.html). O Salgado Filho foi um dos locais atingidos pelas chuvas que atingem o estado desde a semana passada. Te podría interesar O vídeo chama a atenção para o nível da água, que é maior do que o registrado anteriormente. Por conta da mudança dos ventos, há o medo de que o nível do lago Guaíba chegue a níveis anteriores. Uma das aeronaves da companhia Azul Conecta estava, na semana passada, com a água na altura do bagageiro. Neste momento, a cheia já atinge parte das asas. Te podría interesar Risco de chuvas Nota técnica divulgada por institutos de meteorologia alerta para os riscos de [novas chuvas fortes](https://revistaforum.com.br/temas/chuvas-2130.html) em parte do Rio Grande do Sul a partir desta sexta-feira (10). Segundo a análise publicada pelo Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet), em conjunto com o Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais (Cemaden), o Centro Nacional de Gerenciamento de Riscos e Desastres (Cenad) e o Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Inpe), entre a sexta e a segunda-feira (13) as chuvas serão mais intensas nas regiões centro-leste e nordeste do estado, incluindo a região metropolitana de Porto Alegre, onde estão algumas bacias de captação do rio Guaíba. O [documento](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/noticias/inmet-cemaden-e-cenad-emitem-nota-t%C3%A9cnica-sobre-os-riscos-geo-hidrol%C3%B3gicos-para-o-rio-grande-do-sul) aponta que os acumulados de chuva neste período poderão superar os 150 milímetros (mm), indicando a possibilidade de agravamento da [situação do estado](https://revistaforum.com.br/temas/rio-grande-do-sul-182.html). Na segunda, a previsão dos institutos sinaliza a passagem de uma nova frente fria mais intensa sobre a Região Sul do Brasil, \"incluindo a possível formação de um ciclone extratropical nas proximidades da costa, o que pode causar o incremento dos ventos do setor leste\". No decorrer da próxima semana, a frente fria e a chegada de uma massa de ar frio e seco deve causar queda nas temperaturas e possibilidade de chuva. O documento aponta ainda que \"as rajadas de vento seguirão soprando do setor sul e dificultando o escoamento das águas\". Situação dos rios gaúchos Os institutos também analisam o panorama das bacias hidrográficas do estado, pontuando que os rios Taquari, Caí e Sinos seguem em recessão, assim como toda a região do delta do Jacuí. Por conta da velocidade e direção dos ventos, existe uma situação de estabilidade com leve tendência de subida no nível do rio Guaíba. Mas, nos próximos dias, a volta da chuva pode aumentar o volume de água que chega no rio. A previsão aponta que a posição dos ventos na Lagoa dos Patos vai dificultar o escoamento das águas, \"aumentando o risco de inundação dos municípios na região de Pelotas, Rio Grande e arredores\". Por conta dessas condições, o documento adverte que \"é necessário atenção redobrada a bacia do rio Uruguai e seus afluentes, localizados na região da fronteira oeste do estado gaúcho, que devem continuar subindo pelos próximos dias\".",
