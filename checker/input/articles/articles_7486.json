    "text": "Following one of the warmest starts to a year around the globe, humanity is now facing a harsh new reality: the world may already be in breach of the 1.5°C level of long-term global warming set under the Paris Agreement. The stark truth is that the global transition to net zero has yet to take root universally. Emissions from developing and emerging economies are rising rapidly, outpacing reductions achieved in wealthier nations. While 25 years may not seem like a long period of time, technological advancements have the capacity to transform the way we live our lives in the blink of an eye. Take photovoltaics, for example – solar technology, which is believed to have taken 115 years from concept to development, helped drive the manufacturing scale-up in China just 25 years ago. Meanwhile, here in the UAE, we have witnessed the establishment of two of the largest and most cost-effective solar farms – Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park (2015) and Al Dhafra Solar PV (2020) – during this period. In this context, the next 25 years will define the course of our planet for generations to come. Put simply, the decisions we make now, the innovations we pioneer, and the collaborations we forge will determine when – or indeed if – we arrive at net zero. I choose to remain optimistic that, through the power of collective action, we still have the opportunity to create major shifts that will allow us to secure a sustainable future for our planet. But for this to be effective, we must act in synchronisation, and we must act now. When I founded the UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators, or UICCA, in September 2022, I posed a rhetorical question: “What would happen if we eliminated silos and focused on collective action?” We have made significant headway in bridging the gaps over the past two and a half years, but for our actions to generate true and lasting impact, it is imperative that multi-sectoral and multi-industry stakeholders come together to address the challenges that lie ahead. Last week, at the inaugural “UICCA Forum: 25 to 2050”, we gathered leaders across a variety of disciplines to identify the opportunities, while confronting the timeframe-related challenge we are facing. Ahead of the Forum, we asked our broader network to share one action that must be prioritised in the next 25 years, in order to secure a sustainable future. Perhaps one of the most profound contributions came from a young Emirati activist called AlDhabi AlMheiri, who highlighted the importance of global accountability and commitment. At just 10 years old, AlDhabi has the depth of understanding and foresight to recognise that without tangible steps and deadlines that are adhered to, words mean very little. This, together with the many youth-led solutions I have seen emerge across the region, shows great promise in the next generation’s role as the driving force behind a brighter future – particularly as they are the ones who stand to gain or lose the most from the actions we take now. Today, the UICCA has released a report with the key findings from the Forum. However, one overarching sentiment stands out: inclusivity must sit at the heart of all that we do. From the powerful youth voices among us, to those displaced by climate disasters, we must ensure that every voice within our ecosystem is represented and heard, especially the ones being affected the most, as they are often best placed to be part of the solution. This commitment extends to the very language we use to discuss climate issues. Recognising the power of effective communication, we have launched the second edition of our Climate Change Glossary, with support from the UN Development Programme’s Regional Bureau for Arab States as well as the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre. This document aims to provide Arabic and English storytellers, journalists and writers with precise terminology to report on climate matters clearly and accurately. While much of today’s news coverage tends to be negative in nature, there is a treasure trove of untold positive stories that have the power to inspire climate action. My hope is that, by using tools such as the Climate Change Glossary, we will all be able to honour the retelling of these stories, while maintaining authenticity and integrity. The path to net zero requires all of us – not just the usual voices, but stakeholders across every industry, region and demographic – to collectively tackle humanity’s greatest challenge. The clock is ticking, but transformative change is possible when we collectively commit to making it happen – and to young AlDhabi’s point, when we hold ourselves accountable in delivering on those commitments.",

Publié par l’Agence scientifique nationale australienne, une organisation soutenue par l’Etat australien, le magazine a en effet utilisé le [GPT-4 d’Open AI](https://www.20minutes.fr/high-tech/4069546-20240109-2024-microsoft-va-ajouter-touche-claviers-premiere-fois-depuis-30-ans) pour écrire six articles parus au mois de juillet dernier. « De sérieuses inquiétudes » Bien que l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle ait été révélée, l’Association des journalistes scientifiques d’ [Australie ](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/australie)a déclaré que son utilisation « soulevait de sérieuses inquiétudes ». Le président de l’association, Jackson Ryan, a déclaré à l’AFP que dans l’article de Cosmos généré par l’IA et intitulé « Qu’arrive-t-il à notre corps après la mort ? », les descriptions des processus scientifiques étaient « incorrectes » ou « considérablement simplifiées ». Par exemple, l’IA a décrit des signes de rigidité cadavérique trois ou quatre heures après le décès… Or, selon M.

Des inexactitudes qui « nuisent à la confiance » Un autre exemple incluait la description de l’autolyse – un processus dans lequel les [cellules](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/cellule) sont détruites par leurs enzymes – que l’article décrit comme « autodestructeurs ». Là encore, il s’agit d’une « description inappropriée du processus » pour M. Ryan. De manière générale, ces inexactitudes vont nuire à la confiance et à la perception des gens dans la publication, estime-t-il. Un porte-parole de l’Agence scientifique nationale a déclaré que le contenu de l’IA avait pourtant été vérifié par un « \"outil scientifique qualifié\" et édité par l’équipe de Cosmos » .

Check out our review of the first three episodes of Netflix's Berlin. Sonal Pandya Updated Dec 29, 2023 | 06:54 PM IST Berlin Review: Money Heist Spinoff Brings Thrills In Engaging Flashback Tale In the ever-expanding realm of heist dramas on Netflix, the streaming giant has unveiled its latest addition to the genre, Berlin. Following in the footsteps of successful predecessors such as Money Heist and Lupin, this series promises an exhilarating ride for fans of high-stakes capers. Berlin: NarrativeSet in the same universe as Money Heist, Berlin serves as a prequel, focusing on the character Berlin and delving into his dual interests in romance and robbery. The narrative unfolds in the city of love, Paris, where Berlin leads a daring heist to snatch $44 million worth of jewels from an auction house. Guiding a diverse team through an intricately planned operation, viewers are left wondering whether Berlin and his crew will emerge triumphant in the eight-episode series. Related News Berlin: Writing and DirectionHailing from the creative minds of Álex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato, the duo behind Money Heist and Sky Rojo, Berlin introduces the familiar elements of a classic heist—surveillance, deception, and a diverse crew featuring archetypal roles like the tech genius, the upstart, and the wildcard. Notably, Berlin assumes the role of the mastermind, a position previously held by his brother, the Professor, in the original series. Pina and Lobato skillfully infuse the narrative with Berlin's conflicting characteristics, portraying him as both a fun-loving individual and a ruthless strategist. The storyline cleverly explores Berlin's tendencies, especially his knack for falling for the wrong woman concerning the task at hand. Berlin: PerformancesThe Spanish series boasts a stellar cast, with Pedro Alonso reprising his role as Berlin, supported by talented actors like Tristán Ulloa, Michelle Jenner, and others. Despite the show's titular focus, all characters receive significant development, offering a comprehensive view of their roles within the intricate plot. Berlin provides a nostalgic journey into a happier period of the protagonist's life, capturing his enthusiasm for chaos and adrenaline. Alonso's portrayal masterfully navigates Berlin's complex persona, bringing authenticity to the character's evolution. Berlin: CritiqueWith its breezy yet suspenseful tone, Berlin delivers an all-or-nothing vibe, making it ideal for an end-of-the-year streaming binge. While injecting humor and flirtations to distract viewers, the series truly shines when executing jaw-dropping heist sequences, capturing the essence of the genre. While Berlin may not achieve the iconic status of its predecessor, Money Heist, it undeniably succeeds in providing an entertaining crime drama. As it expands the Money Heist franchise, the prequel introduces new characters and weaves an engaging narrative, ensuring that fans remain captivated by the thrilling world of heists and character backstories.

    "text": "“Yo fui sano por su sangre, libre camino por su sangre, soy diferente a lo que era antes”, menciona el apodado como ‘Jefe del Reguetón’ o ‘The Big Boss’, en una estrofa de la canción que se publicará a las 00.00 horas de Puerto Rico, que para Colombia estaría disponible desde la 1:00 a.m. de este viernes. Quizá le pueda interesar: [Tarot de Mavé gratis: lectura de cartas para la semana del 24 al 30 de marzo](/entretenimiento/tarot-de-mave-gratis-lectura-de-cartas-para-la-semana-del-24-al-30-de-marzo-4/) Yankee en este tema destaca la importancia de valores como la fe, la humildad y la gratitud, por encima del ego, la fama y el dinero. Esta canción se publica tras anunciar a finales del año pasado, al completar su quinto concierto ‘La Meta’ con el que finalizó su carrera artística, que se acababa una historia e iba “a comenzar una nueva historia, un nuevo comienzo”, el de vivir su vida para Cristo. De esta manera, Yankee se une a Héctor ‘El Father’, Farruko, Voltio, Gocho, Jomar ‘El Caballo Negro’, Larry Over y El Sica entre los varios artistas urbanos que han decidido dejar la música y seguir el Evangelio. El boricua arrancó su carrera musical a principios de la década de 1990 en el disco ‘Playero 34’, del productor musical DJ Playero, y donde por primera vez el intérprete mencionó la palabra reguetón o reggaeton. Debido al talento que DJ Playero vio en el joven promesa, decidió ubicarlo en sus siguientes producciones, que le catapultaron en Puerto Rico, aunque su estrellato a nivel internacional lo logró en 2004 con el tema ‘Gasolina’. Su último álbum, ‘Legendaddy’, que superó los 600 millones de reproducciones en menos de un mes, contó con colaboraciones de artistas como Bad Bunny, Rauw Alejandro, Pitbull, Natti Natasha y Becky G.

On one hand, she is terrified of heights; on the other, she is loath to turn away from a good-natured goading. So up the ladder she went. “At first I was going to do it without my gear,” said Robertson, a Washougal city councilor. “But (one of the firefighters) said, ‘I dare you,’ and I’m like, ‘Ah, he knows me. I cannot pass on a dare.’” So the pack went back on. “(Firefighters) have got to do it. They don’t have a choice. And the job of that firefighter is not just making up the ladder; their job is to do what’s at the top of the building,” she said. Robertson overcame her fears to complete the exercise, part of Fire Ops 101, an annual event put on by the Washington State Council of Firefighters to provide firefighting training to elected officials and media members. The training offers perspective on how crews operate and the challenges that firefighters face on the job.",

    "title": "Can fear win the vote? Democrats have a dangerous strategy to demonize Trump.",
    "text": "The Democratic Party’s nominee is deliberately spreading false, fear-driven narratives to turn her base against Donald Trump, regardless of the consequences. Have you noticed how Kamala Harris and her allies in the corporate left-wing media have become bolder in labeling Trump a “fascist”? A recent New York Times article revealed that Democrats have shed their reluctance to use the term. In fact, it has become their rallying cry as Election Day approaches. What’s the real goal here? According to John Daniel Davidson at the Federalist , Harris and her supporters are using this rhetoric to energize their base — and more disturbingly, to prepare them for violence if Trump wins. The fearmongering isn’t just about driving people to the polls; it’s about creating an atmosphere of rage and chaos. Let’s show the Democrats that our republic doesn’t bend to fear and certainly doesn’t bend to those who twist the truth for political gain. Harris is deliberately spreading false, fear-driven narratives to turn her base against Trump, regardless of the consequences. This is the same Kamala Harris who, during the George Floyd riots in 2020, encouraged bailing out rioters and urged the violence to continue both before and after the election. For example, Harris has claimed that Trump will use the Department of Justice as a weapon against his political enemies if he returns to office. But let’s pause for a second: Who is using the Justice Department as a political tool right now? Harris’ own administration, led by Joe Biden, has weaponized federal agencies against Trump and conservatives for years. Harris also recently entertained the idea that Trump would round up people who “don’t look white” and throw them into camps. During an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a caller suggested this scenario. Instead of refuting the caller’s paranoia, Harris nodded and said, “ You have hit on a really important point. ” This kind of divisive rhetoric fuels fear and division in our country. Let’s not forget: Trump was president for four years, and there were no camps, roundups, or authoritarian crackdowns on dissenters. Leftists claim Trump and his supporters spread conspiracy theories, but they are the ones pushing baseless and dangerous claims. While Democrats claim to defend democracy, they are increasingly aligning with authoritarianism. For example, the EPA funneled billions of dollars to left-wing organizations, including one tied to Stacey Abrams, for “voter mobilization” efforts. This funding came through the Inflation Reduction Act — a taxpayer-funded omnibus bill. Imagine the outrage if Republicans in Congress gave billions of taxpayer dollars to right-wing groups. The media would be in an uproar, and there would be protests at the White House gates. But because it’s Democrats doing it, the mainstream media turns a blind eye. These are the warning signs of an authoritarian regime. This is why it’s more critical than ever for Americans to see through the left’s manipulation. Trump’s not the fascist here — he’s a threat to the left's power. The real danger lies in the left’s escalating rhetoric, which is designed to incite chaos if things don’t go its way. And let me be clear: That’s exactly what leftists are preparing for. Don’t let them succeed. The best way to counter their lies is by getting out to vote and encouraging others to do the same. If every single one of us does this, we won’t let the fearmongering and lies being peddled by Harris and the Democrats succeed. Let’s show them that our republic doesn’t bend to fear and certainly doesn’t bend to those who twist the truth for political gain.",

    "title": "Norway is essential for cutting difficult emissions, says climate expert John Kerry - TIme News",
    "text": "– Altogether, the First Movers Coalition represents a demand for goods of 16 billion dollars in 2030. Never before have we seen such a large demand for climate technology from the private sector. These companies are committed to changing the way they procure basic goods and services such as steel, aluminium, concrete, as well as jet fuel and shipping. And our friends in Norway have been the first, also within this group, and taken concrete steps to meet these obligations, says John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate change. The FMC was launched during COP26 to help decarbonise the world’s biggest emitting sectors with the help of the private sector and their demand for climate technology. In the course of two years, it has become a leading, global coalition consisting of 96 companies that have entered into various partnerships and established new business models. Seven Norwegian companies are members of FMC: Yara International, which has been involved since the coalition was established in 2021, as well as Hydro, Aker Biomarine, Choose, Höegh Autoliners, Norsk Stål and Norge Mining. – The green shift is not about subsidies, but about investments. We must collaborate across entire value chains, as well as the private and public sectors. Many solutions for decarbonisation already exist, but supply and demand must be developed in parallel. At Yara, we will drive forward the green shift in shipping, fertilizer production and other power-intensive industries, including through the production of low-emission ammonia, and we are now working on what will be the world’s first container ship that uses low-emission ammonia as fuel, the Yara Eyde, says Svein Tore Holsether, CEO of Yara and NHO president. FMC targets sectors that do not have competitive alternatives to fossil energy, such as steel, cement, aluminium, chemicals, shipping, aircraft and transport, as well as carbon capture. Together, these sectors account for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. The members have collectively committed to more than 120 climate measures, which entails a demand for new climate technology corresponding to 16 billion dollars annually by 2030. By adopting these technologies, the annual greenhouse gas emissions will be cut by 31 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. In comparison, the total greenhouse gas emissions in Norway were 48.9 million tonnes in 2022.",

    "text": "Real Madrid 90-89 Baskonia\nHezonja aprovecha el indulto concedido por el BaskoniaSecciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nReal Madrid 90-89 Baskonia\nHezonja aprovecha el indulto concedido por el BaskoniaCruel, fulminante y con una precisión mortal. Mario Hezonja ajusticia al Baskonia con una acción de superclase, un triple que ha parado el reloj a dos décimas del final para colocar un 90-89 definitivo que mata a la escuadra azulgrana. Un golpe certero que ... tumba a una escuadra azulgrana de nuevo impecable en el esfuerzo y en su apuesta baloncestística, pero que sacó en el momento más inoportuno su vena más generosa.\nHasta tres tiros libres se han desperdiciado, dos de Baldwin y uno de Samanic, para encarrilar un triunfo que casi se acariciaba con la yema de los dedos. En realidad, Hezonja ha sido el encargado de abordar una maniobra de resucitación del Real Madrid cuando se encontraba contra las cuerdas. Un parcial de 0-13 permitió al Baskonia entrar en el último minuto con un margen exiguo pero precioso de 84-88.\nA partir de ahí, ha sido Hezonja el salvador de los locales con un primer triple que acercó a los suyos (87-88) antes de que Samanic buscara y no encontrara la respuesta desde la misma distancia. Caían los segundos y Baldwin se ha colocado en la línea de 4,6 metros para errar dos tiros libres. Tras el segundo, Samanic se apoderó del rebote ofensivo para volver a la misma línea tras recibir una nueva falta cuando restaban 17 segundos. Una de cal y otra de arena y el margen en el marcador de 87-89 que se mantenía a distancia de francotirador.\nEl Madrid ha abordado su última posesión y la defensa azulgrana ha dejado unos instantes de margen para actuar a Hezonja. Ha sido recibir el balón, botar a derechas para quitarse sin problemas de encima a Moneke y activar un misil directo al corazón azulgrana. Acierto de pleno y final cruel para un Baskonia que ha vuelto a morir en los últimos segundos después de la correspondiente retahíla de concesiones.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?
