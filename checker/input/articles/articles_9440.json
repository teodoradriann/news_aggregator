    "title": "Renowned Evangelical Rev. John MacArthur Remembered for Upholding Truth to the Woke",
    "text": "Widely renowned evangelical theologian John MacArthur has passed away at the age of 86, leaving a lasting impact on the Christian community. MacArthur, who died on Monday, refused to bend the knee to woke ideology and made national headlines in 2020 when he refused to follow California law to close his church during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nLos Angeles County sued Grace Community Church, and the suit ended in a settlement in 2021 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state could not force churches to close, according to Newsweek.\nNewsweek reported that MacArthur wrote in a letter at the time, “We know that there is no circumstance that can cause the church to close. The church is not only a building but is the bride of Christ and exists to proclaim the truth.”\nIn August 2020, President Donald Trump called MacArthur to thank him for not closing his church, The New York Times reported. The two talked about how Christians could not vote Democrat, and MacArthur said, “There’s no way that a Christian could affirm the slaughter of babies, homosexual activity, homosexual marriage, or any kind of gross immorality.”\nMacArthur passed on Monday after contracting pneumonia, according to his ministry’s website.\nHe pastored Grace Community Church for 56 years and served as president of The Master’s University in Santa Clarita, California, since 1985, before transitioning to chancellor in 2019. His media ministry, Grace to You, is a nonprofit organization that distributes MacArthur’s audio programs, books, and television programs.\nMacArthur opened The Master’s Seminary in 1986, which trains men “for pastoral ministry—to preach the Word of God, reach the world for Christ, and teach others to do the same,” according to the seminary’s website.\nKnown for being an expository preacher, MacArthur dedicated his life’s work to teaching on passages from the Bible verse by verse, to directly align his sermons with the meaning of the Scripture.\nCharlie Kirk, an evangelical Christian and the founder of Turning Point USA, posted on X: “Pastor John MacArthur faithfully testified to the Truth of the Gospel for decades all while the culture, the media, and our politicians peddled lie after lie. He was a legend and he will be deeply missed.”\nPastor John MacArthur faithfully testified to the Truth of the Gospel for decades all while the culture, the media, and our politicians peddled lie after lie.

A little over a year ago, he interviewed MacArthur for “The Focused Pastor,” a resource that seeks to equip and encourage pastors.\n“He had recently written a book on the war on children ,” Zeichik told The Daily Signal. “He was so committed to proclaiming truth and protecting the vulnerable. … You hear people preach sermons. You hear them in chapel. But when you get to sit down and hear their heart face-to-face and his commitment to claiming truth because to not would leave kids vulnerable, I thought was so inspiring.”\nZeichik recalled a time when we heard MacArthur speak about 20 years ago at The Master’s University when he was a student there and somebody asked MacArthur how they could pray for him. MacArthur said that he was preparing to be a guest on “Larry King Live,” on CNN and would have an opportunity to speak to the masses. But what MacArthur said next was unexpected: His prayer request was not for him, but for King.\n“He goes, ‘Pray for Larry, because I feel like Larry’s very close to believing,’” Zeichik said.\nWhile MacArthur was known for plain, true, and unwavering commitment to proclaiming the truth of the Gospel, he ultimately wanted to see that translate to winning over people’s souls for the Lord, Zeichik said.\n“Many are eulogizing Pastor John as internationally renowned, but he was not a celebrity pastor,” Jenna Ellis of the American Family Association and host of “Jenna Ellis in the Morning” said on X. “He was a humble and gracious teacher and witness to the goodness of God. He used every moment to proclaim the truth of the gospel and make the name of Christ renowned and glorified.”\nWithout a doubt, the most significant legal fight I have been a part of was not representing billionaires or presidents, which I have done, but representing this pastor and his church.\nJohn MacArthur’s insistence in the simple truth that the church is essential was one of the… pic.twitter.com/fiz9rx3Xo5\n— Jenna Ellis ? (@realJennaEllis) July 15, 2025 One X account posted a quote by MacArthur on the day of his passing: “All death can do to the believer is deliver him to Jesus.”",

    "text": "Photo: Xinhua\nAfter the British Union Jack, which had flown over Hong Kong for more than 150 years, was lowered for the last time on June 30, 1997, terms such as \"Her Majesty\" and \"Governor,\" which had persisted in various Hong Kong laws, finally made their exit on Wednesday.\nSome legal representatives in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) hailed it as necessary legal reforms to remove such outdated colonial references and fill gaps in the law.\nThe Legislative Council (LegCo) of the HKSAR passed the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2024 in its third reading, officially removing terms like \"Her Majesty,\" \"Governor,\" from the legal texts of several Hong Kong laws.\nThe bill is divided into 15 parts, with the most notable being Part 14, which concerns amendments made for legal adaptation, according to media reports.\nThe modifications in Part 14 include replacing \"Her Majesty, her heirs and successors\" with \"the Central People's Government or the Government of the HKSAR in accordance with the Basic Law and other laws\"; \"Governor\" with \"Chief Executive\"; and \"Governor in Council\" with \"Chief Executive in Council.\"\nIn an interview with Yangcheng Evening News, Deputy Secretary for Justice of HKSAR government Cheung Kwok-kwan said that the Part 14 was proposed by different policy bureau of the Hong Kong government, including the Department of Justice, suggesting amendments to various expressions and provisions in statutory laws. Most of the proposed amendments are of a terminological or technical nature.\nThe purpose of the legal adaptation amendments is to ensure that certain provisions or expressions in ordinances and subsidiary legislation in force before July 1, 1997, conform to the Basic Law of Hong Kong and reflect Hong Kong's status as a SAR of the People's Republic of China, appropriately mirroring the policy intentions of the relevant policy bureau.\n\"The issue of inaccurate legal terminology has existed for many years and should have been addressed long ago,\" Chan Man-ki, a deputy to the National People's Congress and a member of the LegCo, wrote to the Secretary for Justice of the HKSAR government and the Chairman of the Legislative Council's Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services in September 2022, urging the acceleration of the \"decolonization\" of local laws.\nOn Wednesday, Chan Man-ki told Yangcheng Evening News that the long-term presence of colonial-era legal provisions in Hong Kong posed a significant obstacle to the implementation of patriotic education.\nThis amendment directly adapts expressions that do not conform to the constitutional status of the HKSAR, such as deleting terms like \"Her Majesty\" and \"Governor,\" and this amendment effectively and swiftly implements the \"decolonization\" of local laws, correctly reflecting the constitutional order of the HKSAR, Chan was quoted as saying in the media report.\n\"I believe this amendment will enable Hong Kong's local laws to keep pace with the times,\" Chan said.\nWilly Fu, a law professor who is also director of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong & Macao Studies, welcomed and supported the second and third readings of the bill.\n27 years after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, it is necessary to undertake legal reforms to remove these outdated colonial references and fill gaps in the law, Fu said, noting that this is a necessary and appropriate measure that deserves support.\nHong Kong residents should set aside their colonial nostalgia, unite, and fully support the SAR government's lawful administration. By relying on the motherland and connecting with the world, Hong Kong can leverage its unique advantages, integrate into the national development agenda, boost the economy, pursue development, and benefit people's livelihoods, Fu noted.\n\"Hong Kong can achieve a renaissance, faithfully implementing One Country, Two Systems and steadfastly maintaining its prosperity and stability. The future of Hong Kong will certainly be brighter,\" he said.\nTerms such as \"Her Majesty,\" \"royal family,\" and \"loyalty\" might lead to misunderstandings that Hong Kong has not fully returned to the motherland in many aspects, potentially forming long-term misconceptions about One Country, Two Systems, Priscilla Leung, Chairperson of the LegCo's Bills Committee, was quoted as saying in media reports on Wednesday.\nHong Kong was a member of an international treaty in 1989, but has since ceased to apply the relevant regulations. Revising them after 35 years is hard to accept, and Leung said that she hopes that all departments will expedite their work to complete the adaptation process as soon as possible.",

    "title": "Berners-Lee: \"Algoritmi sono causa della tossicità sui social\", la protezione dei dati è nuova sfida Da Euronews IT",
    "text": "La tossicità dei contenuti presenti sulle piattaforme di social media può essere evitata se le aziende modificano i loro algoritmi con un semplice ritocco del codice. Lo ha dichiarato Tim (BIT: TLIT ) Berners-Lee, l'inventore del World wide web, in un'intervista a Euronews Next.\n“Dovreste incolpare la persona che ha scritto il messaggio? Forse, ma in realtà è una piccola parte dell'ecosistema. Forse si dovrebbe incolpare il fatto che l' algoritmo ha mostrato quel tweet a due milioni di persone. Quindi il motivo per cui l'avete visto non è che il mondo web è tossico, è che questo vi farà cliccare, vi farà alzare le sopracciglia”, ha detto l'esperto durante la conferenza tecnologica Web Summit a Lisbona.\nPer le aziende, i post scioccanti sui social media non solo fanno alzare le sopracciglia agli utenti, ma aumentano anche il loro capitale, ha aggiunto.\nUna ricerca pubblicata all'inizio del mese ha rilevato che Elon Musk sembra aver incrementato artificialmente i suoi post sulla sua piattaforma di social media X per promuovere contenuti a favore di Donald Trump .\nRelated\nI fatti più strani su Elon Musk che potreste non conoscere L'appoggio di Musk a Trump fa salire il valore di Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ): superati i mille miliardi di dollari Nel frattempo, una ricerca pubblicata a febbraio dall'University College di Londra e dall'Università di Kent ha rilevato che gli algoritmi utilizzati dalle piattaforme di social media amplificano i contenuti misogini estremi, che vengono poi trasferiti nelle scuole e nella cultura giovanile.\n“È davvero importante rendersi conto che la tossicità deriva dagli algoritmi e che è possibile cambiarli ”, ha dichiarato Berners-Lee.\n“C'è qualche coder che può sedersi lì e modificare il modo in cui l'Intelligenza artificiale viene addestrata in modo che possa essere più sana, costruttiva, creativa e utile”.\nIl Web 35 anni dopo Il World Wide Web compie 35 anni da quando Berners-Lee scrisse una proposta per sviluppare un sistema informativo unico e distribuito per soddisfare la richiesta di condivisione automatizzata delle informazioni tra gli scienziati delle università e degli istituti di tutto il mondo.Alla domanda se il web si è rivelato come si aspettava, ha risposto: “In gran parte è come l'avevo immaginato , anche se credo che il punto fosse se sarebbe stata una piattaforma generale per aggiungere alla creatività altrui. Quindi le tante cose stravaganti che la gente fa, non avrei potuto pensarle”, ha aggiunto.\n“La prova di una buona piattaforma è che le persone la usano per fare cose che hanno creato e che il creatore stesso della piattaforma non potrebbe mai eguagliare”, ha ancora spiegato Berners-Lee e ha poi detto che ci sono “un sacco di cose meravigliose” che il web ha contribuito a creare, soprattutto quando si tratta di istruzione, e che ci sono due lati nel dibattito se i bambini dovrebbero avere o meno i telefoni nelle scuole.\nRelated\nGrecia, da settembre vietati i cellulari nelle scuole Concorda sul fatto che se i bambini possono usare i loro telefoni per accedere alle informazioni o alle piattaforme open source come GitHub, è una buona cosa. Il motivo per cui i genitori si preoccupano del fatto che i bambini abbiano i telefoni è che avranno accesso alle pagine di Facebook (NASDAQ: META ), Instagram, TikTok o Snapchat, ha detto Berners-Lee.\n“Se un algoritmo per i social media polarizza effettivamente le persone, se si può dimostrare matematicamente che polarizza le persone e che c'è un sacco di gente che lo sostiene, allora si può regolamentare”, ha detto.\n“Dobbiamo trovare il modo di dare ai bambini un telefono che risponda a tutte le cose belle, ma che blocchi tutte le cose che polarizzano la società”, ha spiegato l'esperto.\nLa nuova missione di Berners-Lee Quest'anno Berners-Lee ha chiuso la World wide web foundation, che ha operato per 15 anni con l'obiettivo di rendere il web più accessibile e conveniente.Lui e la cofondatrice della fondazione, Rosemary Leith, hanno dichiarato che la missione dell'organizzazione è stata in qualche modo portata a termine, con il 70 per cento delle persone oggi connesse al mondo online rispetto al 20 per cento di quando hanno iniziato.\nBerners-Lee è concentrato su una nuova battaglia: la protezione dei dati .\nIn una lettera online di quest'anno, ha affermato che il web è stato creato per essere “uno strumento per potenziare l'umanità”, ma che nell'ultimo decennio “invece di incarnare questi valori, ha contribuito a eroderli”.\nTim Berners-Lee al World Web Forum di Zurigo, 2017 Walter Bieri/ KEYSTONE / WALTER BIERI\n“Le conseguenze sono sempre più ampie. Dalla centralizzazione delle piattaforme alla rivoluzione dell'Intelligenza artificiale, il web funge da livello fondamentale del nostro ecosistema online, un ecosistema che ora sta rimodellando il panorama geopolitico , guidando i cambiamenti economici e influenzando la vita delle persone in tutto il mondo”, ha aggiunto nella dichiarazione.\nLa sua soluzione alle disfunzioni del web è un terzo livello di protocolli, che dia a una persona la possibilità di accedere a qualcosa con il proprio ID personale. Nel 2016 ha lanciato il progetto Solid e successivamente una nuova società chiamata Inrupt per aiutare Solid a decollare.\nSolid è accessibile dal browser. Invece di un'app, lo chiama “Pod”, dove è possibile memorizzare i propri dati privati e accedervi con estrema facilità. In termini più semplici, si può pensare a una chiave o a un ID digitale che viene tenuto al sicuro .\n“Possiamo restituire il valore che è andato perduto e ripristinare il controllo sui dati personali”, ha dichiarato Berners-Lee.\n“Con Solid, gli individui decidono come gestire, utilizzare e condividere i propri dati”, ha aggiunto. La tecnologia ha già iniziato a prendere piede ed è ora utilizzata nelle Fiandre.\n“La mia grande spinta è sempre stata quella di mettere in grado gli esseri umani, le persone”, ha detto Berners-Lee, aggiungendo che ‘la tecnologia dovrebbe lavorare per voi’.",

    "text": "Con l'87% di raccolta differenziata, Baronissi (SA) è la prima città \"Rifiuti Free\" - con oltre 15.000 abitanti - in provincia di Salerno anche nel 2024. Comuni Rifiuti Free vuol dire corretto funzionamento della raccolta, dove ogni cittadino produce, al massimo, 75 kg di secco residuo all'anno, ovvero di rifiuti indifferenziati avviati allo smaltimento. Dal report reso pubblico oggi da Legambiente, emerge nello specifico che Baronissi è prima in provincia di Salerno per i comuni con oltre 15.000 abitanti per la produzione pro capite di secco residuo.\n \"Si tratta di un importante risultato, - spiega Anna Petta, sindaco di Baronissi - raggiunto anche nella classifica nazionale di Legambiente, che dimostra l'efficacia del modello di gestione dei rifiuti applicato e conferma come la tutela ambientale sia un obiettivo raggiungibile. Baronissi si attesta come Comune riciclone da anni, merito dei cittadini, che ormai hanno capito l'importanza della raccolta differenziata, e degli operatori che ogni giorno lavorano per realizzare un efficiente porta a porta\".\n Il titolo di \"riciclone\" spetta ai Comuni che hanno una raccolta differenziata superiore al 65%, ma Baronissi già da anni ha superato il 75%. \"Baronissi - aggiunge Alfonso Farina, assessore all'Ambiente del Comune di Baronissi - ha raggiunto alti standard di raccolta differenziata grazie a 15 anni di impegno e progettualità.\n L'attenzione ai rifiuti e al decoro resta centrale nell'amministrazione di Baronissi. Questo è un premio simbolico, ma per la nostra città deve essere motivo di vanto e soddisfazione: i nostri cittadini, insieme al lavoro certosino dei nostri operatori ecologici, riescono a contribuire alla salvaguardia dell'ambiente e al rispetto del nostro territorio\".",

    "title": "Review: Patrick Leahy, Senate stalwart",
    "text": "Review: Patrick Leahy, Senate stalwart Like many great statesmen, Patrick Leahy is a chameleon. He is the small-town lawyer from Vermont who became a Democratic senator and moved comfortably for decades in the corridors of power. He is the “Watergate Baby” who challenged the old ways of doing business in Congress before evolving into one of the greatest defenders of the institution’s norms. On matters of both policy and cultural sensibility, the now-retired politician has a way of seeming simultaneously traditional and progressive. These juxtapositions are at the core of The Road Taken, Leahy’s deeply personal new memoir. He writes lovingly about his family, his Catholic faith and his home state but seems focused largely on describing the Washington, D.C., that was—and what it has become. Leahy is one of many Washington veterans who lament the erosion of old-fashioned give-and-take, across-the-aisle, art-of-the-possible parliamentary imperatives, laying blame for their decline largely at the feet of Donald Trump and his political allies. In the latter stages of the book, Leahy pillories Trump as a gasbag who never listens to anyone. In Leahy’s mind, the Trump administration succeeded primarily in unmooring the country’s governing institutions to the point of unworkability, putting piles of right-wing judges on the bench and setting the stage for the Jan. 6 insurrection. Leahy concedes that the ignorance he witnessed from the MAGA crowd has crept into the Democratic side of the aisle. Citing the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, Leahy bemoans the counterproductive tactics some liberal and left-wing groups employed to oppose Barrett’s nomination. These included the idea that Democratic senators should have simply boycotted the hearings, which would have allowed for her confirmation without Barrett even facing serious questioning. Despite Leahy’s extensive discussions of recent events in Washington, his memoir is not primarily a rumination on the recent past. It reads more like a requiem for a far-from-perfect, though basically positive, political culture. Nor is this a book thorough in its dissections of public policy or the legislative process. The Road Taken is a kind of catalog of dramatis personae, but not just of people, because Leahy also focuses on the places he inhabited. Leahy spent eight terms in the Senate; many of the people he cites are well-known. Never does the appearance of a big figure come across as name dropping. If anything, he talks about his interactions with Washington bigwigs to show how much the kind of person inhabiting those positions has changed. “Mr. Conservative,” Barry Goldwater, for example, takes the stage to stand up for the Supreme Court nomination of his friend and longtime colleague Sandra Day O’Connor against criticism from ideologues within his own party. O’Connor went on to be confirmed 99-0, a tally that would be unthinkable today. Leahy writes with great warmth about three prairie legislators, all with distinct political inclinations, who mentored him upon his arrival in Washington: Bob Dole, George McGovern and Hubert Humphrey. As a native Vermonter, he related a great deal to each of their rural upbringings and admired their respective commitments to working in a bipartisan fashion to achieve shared policy goals. Though Leahy never discussed it explicitly, his memoir demonstrates the degree to which the political diversity that existed in Washington several decades ago has dissolved in favor of a politics of litmus tests. Leahy spends considerable time discussing his life as a Catholic in Vermont, historically a Protestant stronghold. His father was an Irish Catholic Democrat in a state where their numbers were few and far between. Leahy’s education came entirely through Catholic schools. He attended parochial elementary and secondary schools in Montpelier before spending his undergraduate days at St. Michael’s College in Colchester, Vt., studying government at the Edmundite institution. At St. Michael’s, Leahy found a mentor in Ed Pfeifer, a historian who had attended the same schools that he had in Montpelier. Pfeifer played a significant role in shaping Leahy’s interests and aspirations, “challenging us to think critically, test our ideas, and debate relentlessly.” Leahy concluded his education at Georgetown Law School. Well before attending law school in Washington, Leahy caught the “political bug”—a product of both his upbringing and formal education. In 1960, Leahy knocked on doors for John F. Kennedy. He heard time and again from Vermont voters who, even though they were not exactly fond of Richard Nixon, felt that they had to vote for the Republican because Kennedy was a Catholic. Even after Kennedy’s historic election win, this lesson about voter prejudice remained front and center in Leahy’s mind. When Leahy decided to run for the Senate in 1974, not only were his youth (he was 33) and party affiliation considered detriments to his electability; his Catholic faith was still also considered a hurdle, nearly 15 years after Kennedy was elected president. A castle keep of Yankee WASPdom, Vermont had elected its first Catholic governor, Tom Salmon, only two years earlier, but Leahy benefited from the “throw the bums out” mentality of the first election after Watergate. The Vermont press dubbed him “the accidental senator”—the election of a Catholic in that state being no small part of the “accident.” Turning to more recent times, Leahy expresses particular ire with “the convenient, sudden interest of so many non-Catholics in defending the faith,” pointing out episodes of Republican politicos advancing their policy goals by painting their opponents as anti-Catholic bigots on issues such as abortion. He seethes at Republicans such as Rick Santorum and Josh Hawley (who was raised Methodist but later joined a Reformed church), whom he describes as explaining to him what political opinions made someone a “real” Catholic—itself a bizarre manifestation of litmus-test political culture. Shockingly, the event that made Leahy a statewide figure in Vermont, giving him sufficient name recognition and reputation to challenge for a Senate seat, receives nary a mention. During his tenure as state’s attorney in Chittenden County (Vermont’s most populous county), Leahy took down a villainous narcotics agent named Paul Lawrence who planted drugs on dozens of young Vermonters and put piles of innocent people in jail. Leahy and his squad caught Lawrence red-handed, and the one-time Green Mountain State “super cop” found himself behind bars. Governor Tom Salmon ended up pardoning 71 people convicted based on Lawrence’s testimony. While The Road Taken offers an incomplete look at the legacy of the senator from Vermont, it reveals a series of often compelling snapshots of his life and times. At its best, it reads like an acquaintance’s yearbook, replete with the signatures and recollections of other familiar faces.

    "text": "Guerre en Ukraine : attaque de drones russes, une promesse de Biden, arrestations pour sabotage au profit de Kiev… le point sur la situation\nTous les jours, Midi Libre fait le point sur la situation en Ukraine. Ce jeudi 26 septembre 2024, découvrez les dernières actualités autour de ce conflit.\nNouvelle attaque russe de drones sur l’Ukraine\nLa Russie a lancé une attaque aérienne sur l’Ukraine dans la nuit de jeudi 26 septembre, tuant au moins une personne et endommageant des infrastructures critiques, selon les autorités. L’armée de l’air ukrainienne a de son côté annoncé avoir détruit 66 drones et quatre missiles de croisière lancés par la Russie au cours de la nuit de mercredi à jeudi. Un total de 78 drones de conception iranienne et six missiles ont été lancés en direction de plusieurs régions du pays, a-t-elle précisé.\nÀ Odessa, dans le sud de l’Ukraine, une femme a été tuée lors d’un tir de missile et huit personnes ont été blessées lors d’une attaque à la bombe guidée sur la ville de Zaporijjia, dans le sud-est du pays, a déclaré le ministre de l’Intérieur, Ihor Klymenko, sur les réseaux sociaux. La défense aérienne ukrainienne a abattu au moins cinq drones à la périphérie de Kyiv et des explosions ont retenti dans la ville tôt jeudi, selon des journalistes de Reuters.\nLes alertes aux raids aériens restent actives dans la capitale et dans la majeure partie du centre du pays. Le chef de l’administration militaire de Kyiv, Serhi Popko, a signalé quelques dégâts infligés par des drones aux infrastructures civiles. Une vingtaine de voitures et une canalisation de gaz d’un quartier résidentiel ont été endommagées, a-t-il précisé. Des débris ont également été retrouvés dans une aire de jeux pour enfants.\nCertaines parties de la ville d’Ivano-Frankivsk, dans l’ouest du pays, ont été privées d’électricité à la suite d’une frappe russe sur des infrastructures essentielles, a déclaré la gouverneure de la région, Svitlana Onichtchouk.\nBiden promet à Zelensky que la \"Russie ne l’emportera pas\"\nJoe Biden s’est engagé jeudi à ce que la Russie \"n’emporte pas\" la guerre en Ukraine, lors d’une visite de Volodymyr Zelensky à la Maison Blanche. La \"Russie ne l’emportera pas\", a lancé le dirigeant américain depuis le Bureau ovale, à 39 jours de l’élection présidentielle américaine qui s’annonce extrêmement serrée, et dont dépend l’avenir du soutien à Kiev.\nAfin d'\"aider l’Ukraine à gagner cette guerre\", le président américain a annoncé jeudi matin une \"augmentation de l’aide à la sécurité\", sans toutefois mentionner le feu vert espéré par Kiev pour tirer vers la Russie des missiles de longue portée fabriqués aux Etats-Unis. Volodymyr Zelensky a salué cette annonce qui favorisera, selon lui, la \"victoire\" de son pays dans la guerre que lui livre la Russie.\nArrestation de six Russes accusés de sabotage au profit de Kiev\nLes services de sécurité russes (FSB) ont annoncé ce jeudi l’arrestation de six personnes dont trois adolescents, le plus jeune né en 2009, qu’ils accusent d’avoir incendié des infrastructures ferroviaires et de communication pour le compte de l’Ukraine. Depuis le début de l’offensive militaire en Ukraine, les autorités russes ont multiplié les arrestations pour espionnage, trahison ou collaboration avec l’Ukraine dans le cadre d’une vaste campagne de répression.\nLe FSB a dit avoir arrêté six citoyens russes \"impliqués dans des incendies criminels d’infrastructures de transport ferroviaire et de communication\", sans plus de détail sur les sites qui auraient été visés. Ils sont accusés de \"terrorisme\" et de \"haute trahison\", et risquent des peines de prison allant jusqu’à la perpétuité, selon les services russes.\nTrois sont mineurs, dont un né en 2007 et un autre en 2009, d’après cette même source. Le FSB affirme que les suspects avaient été \"recrutés par les services secrets ukrainiens\" contre une rémunération de 10 000 à 15 000 roubles, soit environ 100 à 150 euros. Une vidéo, diffusée par les médias d’Etat, montre des agents du FSB en train de plaquer de jeunes hommes au sol, avant de les embarquer dans un van blanc.\nL’un est interrogé alors qu’il est menotté, visage contre le sol. Un autre, la joue tuméfiée, dit avoir été contacté via Telegram, messagerie très populaire, afin de commettre des incendies. Sur ces images, les suspects n’évoquent que des incendies d’antennes-relais téléphoniques. L’un affirme que leur contact avait transmis des instructions pour concocter des explosifs afin de mener des attaques de plus grande ampleur, par exemple contre des trains. Ils ont été arrêtés dans les régions d’Irkoutsk, de Nijni-Novgorod et de Samara, toutes très éloignées de la frontière ukrainienne.",
