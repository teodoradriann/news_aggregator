    "title": "财经聚焦｜一些地区取消\"国补\"？不存在的--消费品以旧换新热点追踪",
    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n“618”期间，线上线下促销活动持续多日，消费者对于以旧换新的热情不减。然而，社交媒体也出现一些关于部分地区暂时无法申领“国补”的讨论。针对相关热点话题，记者在多地进行了采访。\n5月底以来，关于重庆、江苏、湖北等地“国补”暂时无法领取的讨论，在社交媒体上引发关注。\n记者查阅云闪付App重庆消费品以旧换新页面，一则公告提及绿色智能家电、家装厨卫“焕新”27个小类补贴资金已使用完毕。\n近日在登录淘宝的国补专区时，记者也看到，江苏省的页面曾出现“江苏国补活动升级中，升级期间您将无法领取”的提示。京东国补专区湖北省的页面也曾出现“湖北智能家居国补活动升级中”等提醒。\n正是基于这些表述，部分网友开始猜测，一些地方“国补”是否就此停止？\n通过采访多地相关负责部门和相关负责人，记者了解到，所谓取消“国补”的情况是不存在的。\n记者联系江苏省商务厅市场运行和消费促进处获悉，江苏消费品以旧换新政策并未暂停。江苏此前发布的相关通知明确了“消费品以旧换新资金实行限额管理、资格调控”的规定，即“国补”实行限额管理。\n重庆市商务委5月下旬在其官网“公开信箱”栏目里回复表示，全市加力扩围实施消费品以旧换新补贴政策，市民群众参与积极性高，第一阶段补贴资金即将使用完毕。目前，相关部门正在起草第二阶段以旧换新补贴政策。\n湖北省商务厅明确答复记者称，湖北国补活动贯穿2025年全年，持续到12月31日。“目前家电和数码3C类产品国补资格券每日限量发放，先到先得。”湖北省商务厅流通处工作人员董伟告诉记者。\n业内人士表示，少部分地区阶段性地完善了“国补”政策实施节奏，实际上消费品以旧换新工作将持续全年，消费者每月每周都有参与申领“国补”的机会。最近一些企业、平台和自媒体借机炒作，搞饥饿营销，营造恐慌情绪，消费者要特别注意辨别。实际上，除上述少数地区外，大多数省份国补优惠活动也在正常推进。\n消费品以旧换新是国家层面部署推进的一项重要政策。为何各地执行落地后，“国补”使用情况不尽相同？\n记者通过调研发现，在国家确定补贴规则“大框架”的基础上，各地拥有一定的自主权，可以确定国补落地的“小细节”，如具体如何申领使用补贴等。\n中国社科院财经战略研究院财政研究室主任、研究员何代欣认为，少数地区政策实施进度较快，跟当地消费结构和消费者积极性有关。“这也说明市场对‘国补’的需求旺盛，政策激发了消费活力。”\n今年以来，消费品以旧换新政策“加力”又“扩围”，不仅增加了手机、平板、洗碗机等新品类，安排的超长期特别国债资金规模也翻了一番，从去年的1500亿元增至今年的3000亿元。\n这3000亿元超长期特别国债，再加上地方按比例配套和自行安排的资金，共同构成了“国补”的资金来源。\n记者了解到，这3000亿元是“切块”分配到地方的。在分配时，会综合各地区常住人口数量、地区生产总值、汽车和家电保有量、2024年消费品以旧换新政策及资金执行情况等因素，资金分配向2024年消费品以旧换新工作成效较好的地区适度倾斜。\n今年中央安排超长期特别国债支持消费品以旧换新的资金总规模是3000亿元，这个额度是确定的。为了让地方合理有序可持续地使用中央资金，在下达流程上，今年的3000亿元中央资金按批次下达。\n记者从有关部委了解到，今年1月和4月已分别下达两批共计1620亿元中央资金，支持地方做好一、二季度消费品以旧换新工作。后续还有1380亿元中央资金将在三、四季度分批有序下达，同时地方也将相应配套和自行安排足够的地方资金，“国补”还将继续惠及广大消费者。\n消费品以旧换新政策落地的相关链条长、环节多。在6月初推出的“中国经济圆桌会”访谈中，国家发展改革委综合司副司长丁琳在介绍扩内需的一系列政策举措中提及，将加快消费品以旧换新资金下达。\n记者在调研中发现，多地积极优化完善政策流程，着力减轻参与企业垫付补贴资金的压力，创新工作举措，提升消费者的体验感和获得感。\n多位专家学者表示，自去年实施以来，消费品以旧换新政策已成为促消费、扩内需的重要发力点。\n在湖北，截至6月11日，今年全省3C数码、家电、厨卫、电动自行车等以旧换新产品总销售量3358.15万台，累计带动销售总额414.83亿元；在辽宁，全省参与消费品以旧换新活动的消费者已达200万人次，直接拉动消费超过150亿元……从各地落地情况来看，政策进展积极、效应持续显现。\n商务部数据显示，截至5月31日，2025年消费品以旧换新5大品类合计带动销售额1.1万亿元，发放直达消费者的补贴约1.75亿份。\n“从各地实践来看，政策不仅直接带动相关消费品销售额显著提升，还积极推动相关消费品结构升级和相关产业链转型跃升。”中央财经大学教授、中国财政发展协同创新中心副主任姚东旻说，随着后续资金下达、相关制度持续优化，消费品以旧换新政策有望继续发挥积极效用、惠及更多百姓。（记者申铖、刘巍巍、龚联康、李晓婷）\n（责任编辑：苗苏）",

Hundreds of concert goers visited the local organ procurement organization last Saturday, and enjoyed the show hosted by legendary actor and musician, Danny Trejo, co-hosted by Becky Lu, and including the performances of Baby Bash, Cota the Barber, Pepe Marquez, Amoraa, Tarah New, and Raquel. The event also included testimonials from donor families, transplant recipients and living donors.\nThis press release features multimedia.

(Photo: OneLegacy)\nA portion of the funds raised by this concert will be donated to the OneLegacy Foundation to help promote public education efforts to inspire local communities to Donate Life. With over 100,000 men, women, and children currently waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant in the U.S., OneLegacy continuously connects with local communities to inspire them to say “YES” to organ, eye and tissue donation and register as donors.\n“Our partnership with Danny Trejo has opened the doors to a group of talented musicians and producers, ‘Connecting the Dots’ with a greater audience of Trejo fans and local community members that trust Danny as a native Angelino,” said E’Tiffany Jones, Head of Communications and Strategic Partnerships at OneLegacy. “We are excited about the upcoming initiatives between OneLegacy and Danny Trejo’s enterprises, and we are immensely grateful to Danny and his team for using their voice and platform to lift our mission.”\nThe OneLegacy surgical team took the stage for a moment of acknowledgement. Trejo claimed, “There are angels among us,” to which the team received a standing ovation.\nHundreds of guests from around Los Angeles visited OneLegacy on Saturday, March 9. The event included a display of lowrider cars, a special meet and greet session with Danny Trejo, merchandise from Trejo’s Music Label and Danny Trejo, raffle prizes provided by OneLegacy and the OneLegacy Ambassadors, a 90’s inspired photo booth and food and drinks provided by Trejo’s Tacos.\nAbout OneLegacy\nOneLegacy is the nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives through organ, eye and tissue donation in seven counties in Southern California: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Kern. It serves more than 200 hospitals, 10 transplant centers, a diverse population of 20 million people across the region and waiting recipients across the country. Becoming an eye, organ or tissue donor is easy and can be done by registering online at donateLIFEcalifornia.org/OneLegacy or by “checking YES” at your local DMV.

The stores will have items such as noise reducing headphones, fidget tools, visual cue cards, KultureCity branded lanyards and strobe reduction glasses available.\nIn its announcement, Lego shared the story of Sean, an adult with autism who is a Lego fan.\n\"Being able to experience the Lego store at my own pace would have allowed me to connect to so many other people and Lego fans, and truly feel like I belong,\" Sean said. \"This move will allow for people like me, a full-grown adult, to experience everything the store has to offer and let children visiting the store have their own perspective on their own lives changed in a positive way. That’s something that can’t be replaced.”\nSEE MORE: Study finds link between diet drinks and boys with autism\nLego also announced changes to its Lego Life Magazine, which include numbering the boxes used in cartoons to make them easier to follow; ensuring consistent and meaningful use of visual simples; planning content to suit varied abilities and interests; and having consistency in placement of useful items, such as prompts for activity answers.\n“All Lego entities are united by our mission to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow and a belief that the benefits of play are equally critical to all children. This fuels our exploration of how to make the Lego experience more inclusive and welcoming for everyone,\" Colette Burke, chief commercial officer at the Lego Group, said.\nAccording to KultureCity, it has worked with businesses across the world to make 1,800 sensory-friendly. A list is available on its website.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 36 children have autism in the U.S. The CDC added that over 5.4 million adults have autism.",

    "text": "The first weekend of 2025 is here and it will get off to a cold start.\nA strong cold front will push through on Friday morning bringing some very gusty winds behind it. Winds will gust at 25-35MPH out of the northwest through the day. Highs will only reach the mid/upper-40s with feel like temps in the 30s through most of the day.\nSaturday will remain breezy with winds gusting around 10-20MPH early dropping off gradually through the day. The heart of this cold snap will be overhead with highs in the mountains remaining in the 30s and low/mid-40s for the lower elevations.\nThings will get interesting very briefly on Sunday with some light sleet or freezing rain possible just as the precipitation moves in ahead of our next rain maker, but it will change over quickly to just cold rain. Rain will remain likely through the day Sunday and especially overnight. Total rainfall Sunday into Monday of 1-2″ is likely. Fortunately, no severe weather or flooding concerns exist right now but stay tuned in case that changes.\nHave a great weekend!",

    "title": "Apple: Geheime Pläne für Roboter und KI-Revolution enthüllt",
    "text": "Der Tech-Gigant aus Cupertino steht unter Druck. Nach dem verhaltenen Start der Vision Pro und dem Gefühl, den Anschluss an die KI-Revolution verpasst zu haben, schien die Innovationskraft von Apple zu schwinden. Doch nun sickern Details eines geheimen Masterplans durch, der einen Großangriff auf völlig neue Märkte vorsieht: Roboter, eine runderneuerte KI und eine Offensive im Smart-Home-Bereich.\nDas Herzstück der neuen Strategie ist ein ambitioniertes Robotik-Projekt, das für eine Markteinführung um 2027 anvisiert wird, wie Bloomberg berichtete. Dabei handelt es sich nicht um einen humanoiden Roboter sondern um einen cleveren Tischroboter. Insider beschreiben das Gerät als eine Art iPad, das auf einem beweglichen Arm montiert ist. Dieser Roboter soll Nutzern im Raum folgen, sich bei Gesprächen zuwenden und als proaktiver Begleiter im Alltag dienen.\nDoch die eigentliche Revolution steckt im Inneren: Eine von Grund auf neu entwickelte Version von Siri soll dem Gerät eine beinahe menschliche Intelligenz verleihen. Diese KI soll in der Lage sein, Gespräche zwischen mehreren Personen zu verstehen, kontextbezogene Vorschläge zu machen – etwa für Restaurants oder Rezepte – und komplexe Aufgaben wie die Planung einer Reise im Dialog zu erledigen. Damit würde Apple nicht nur zu OpenAI aufschließen, sondern die KI direkt in den physischen Raum der Nutzer bringen.\nApple hat erkannt, dass das vernetzte Zuhause ein entscheidendes Schlachtfeld der Zukunft ist. Um hier endlich eine dominante Rolle zu spielen, plant der Konzern eine Doppelstrategie. Bereits im kommenden Jahr soll ein smartes Display auf den Markt kommen, das als Einstiegsprodukt dient. Ähnlich wie Googles Nest Hub oder Amazons Echo Show soll es die Steuerung des Zuhauses, Videotelefonie und Medienwiedergabe ermöglichen.\nParallel dazu wird eine eigene Linie von Sicherheitskameras entwickelt, die es direkt mit dem Marktführer Ring (Amazon) aufnehmen soll. Durch fortschrittliche Gesichtserkennung und Infrarotsensoren sollen die Kameras nicht nur für Sicherheit sorgen, sondern auch intelligente Automationen ermöglichen. Verlässt eine Person einen Raum, könnte das Licht automatisch ausgeschaltet oder die Musik an den Geschmack des jeweiligen Familienmitglieds angepasst werden. Ziel ist es, das Apple-Ökosystem noch unverzichtbarer zu machen und Kunden enger an die Marke zu binden.\nAll diese Hardware-Pläne wären ohne eine massive Weiterentwicklung der Software undenkbar. Intern laufen die Arbeiten an einer runderneuerten Siri auf Hochtouren. Unter dem Codenamen „Linwood“ wird an einem neuen Gehirn für die Sprachassistentin gearbeitet, das auf modernen großen Sprachmodellen basiert. Diese neue Siri soll tief in die persönlichen Daten des Nutzers integriert werden, um präzise und personalisierte Antworten zu liefern.\nSoftware-Chef Craig Federighi deutete kürzlich in einem internen Meeting an, wie ernst es dem Konzern ist: „Die Arbeit, die wir in diese komplette Überarbeitung von Siri gesteckt haben, hat uns die nötigen Ergebnisse geliefert“, so Federighi. Er fügte hinzu, dass dies Apple in die Lage versetze, „ein viel größeres Upgrade zu liefern, als wir es uns vorgestellt hatten“.\n|",

    "text": "Nearly 400,000 homes and businesses in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont grappled with power outages early Friday after a severe winter storm dumped several inches of snow in the northeast region and caused major travel disruptions.\nHeavy snow covers Beaver Meadow Golf Course in Concord, N.H., on Thursday.\nKey Facts According to Power Outage.us, more than 285,000 homes were without power in Maine early on Friday.\nIn a statement on Facebook, the state’s largest power supplier, Central Maine Power Company, said its crews were working to restore power in all affected areas but added that the “damage is severe and repairs are expected to take multiple days.”\nIn neighboring New Hampshire, more than 109,000 homes and businesses remained without power early on Friday, along with 14,500 in Vermont.\nNew Hampshire’s biggest electricity provider, Eversource, said its crews were also working overnight to restore power in affected areas but warned: “This will be a multi-day restoration effort.”\nThe state’s other major power provider, New Hampshire Electric Co-Op, also sought patience from customers and said they are facing a “lengthy restoration process.”\nWhat To Watch For In an update Friday morning, the National Weather Service said the low-pressure system that caused the northeast winter storm would “linger around Downeast Maine” for the next few days and spread “snow showers” across the state and nearby areas that may be as high as 4 to 8 inches. But the “heaviest snowfall” is expected to end at night.\nCrucial Quote “As crews continue to clear the roads, I urge Maine people to drive safely during the Friday morning commute…Be sure to move over for plow trucks, utility crews, and first responders working to keep us safe—it’s the law,” Maine Governor Janet Mills said, adding that all state offices will open after 11 a.m. local time on Friday.",

    "text": "Sergio Sylvestre è stato uno dei protagonisti della quindicesima edizione di Amici , ovvero quella che si svolse nel 2016 e che lo vide trionfare sugli altri concorrenti. Il cantante, poi, partecipò anche al Festival di Sanremo nel 2017 e fece altre importanti apparizioni su palchi noti. Se di Sergio artista si conosce molto, di Sergio persona non si sa quasi nulla, se non che è originario di Los Angeles. Proprio per questo, il suo coming out è stata una sorpresa anche per i suoi fan.\nSergio Sylvestre e il fidanzato Sergio Sylvestre , anche quando era ad Amici , ha sempre dato prova della sua grande discrezione e, infatti, i suoi fan non si sono mai stupiti molto se, una volta, terminato il programma non hanno mai saputo nulla della sua vita privata. In realtà, si vociferava che si stesse frequentando con una ragazza ma, poi, non si è più saputo niente. Negli ultimi giorni, tuttavia, Sergio è apparso nelle storie e nei post Instagram di Roberto De Carolis . I due sembrano essere felici insieme: ridono, sorridono e si dedicano cuori e storie. I follower del cantante non si aspettavano il suo coming out ma sono molto felici per lui e Roberto (del quale non si sa praticamente nulla) e per questo hanno lasciato commenti molto positivi.\nVisualizza questo post su Instagram Un post condiviso da Roberto de Carolis (@rdecarolis)\nIl fidanzato di Sergio Sylvestre Una delle poche caratteristiche che si possono carpire dal profilo di Roberto De Carolis è che non è un personaggio dello spettacolo, ama i cani e lo sport e lo si capisce anche dal suo fisico super tonico. Lui e Sergio , recentemente, si sono concessi qualche giorno di vacanza ad Amsterdam .",
