    "text": "As expected, the start of October has been quite dry in Colorado – and hot, too. But fear not, powderhounds, a round of snow is on the way. According to [Mountain-Forecast.com](http://Mountain-Forecast.com), October 18 and 19 should bring a bit of snow to some of the higher peaks around the state, including about four inches on [Longs Peak.](https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Longs-Peak/forecasts/4345) That's obviously not a lot of snow, but it's a start, with cooler temperatures expected to emerge that same week, as well. While at least one Colorado resort tends to be open before the end of October, slopes around the state are still lacking snow. That said, resorts are starting to get their snow guns ready to go, set to start firing as soon as temperatures drop to a cold enough level consistently to support their efforts. At this point, the OutThere Colorado team is still hopeful that an October opening will be the case – Arapahoe Basin is one spot to watch closely for potential updates as they're usually a frontrunner on drier years given their higher average elevation. So there you have it – while it might seem like the currently hot and dry October that's underway has no end in sight, that's not the case. Coloradans just have to wait about a week or so for another cold front.",

    "text": "Bengals' Ja'Marr Chase on Chiefs secondary: 'Nothing' stands out [Ja'Marr Chase](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jamarr-chase-player) and the [Cincinnati Bengals](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals-team) (8-7) meet [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/patrick-mahomes-ii-player) and the [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs-team) (9-6) again this coming Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium — but likely not for the last time. In what's a rematch of the last two AFC Championship Games, what impresses Chase about the unit that he'll line up against? Nothing. Literally, \"nothing\" stands out to him about Kansas City's secondary. \"If I'm being honest, nothing, they just know how to play us,\" Chase told the Cincinnati press core Thursday on what stands out about the Chiefs secondary. \"They know the leverages, they know what splits we in; they just know what we're gonna do at certain moments; they throw a little double-doubles at us to stop the two best players on our side, and that's all they do. It's not really like they got a [Jalen Ramsey](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jalen-ramsey-player) on their squad.\" Chase later doubled down on his comments. \"They can take it how they want it; I don't care,\" [Chase said](https://twitter.com/Trags/status/1740478104886546451). \"At the end of the day, there's only so much that I can do myself. It's not like I'm Iron Man; I can't throw the football to myself. It's a team sport. I know what I see on paper, and I know what I see in-game. That's why they double everybody because they can't do it one-on-one. The best player on their team is [L'Jarius] [Sneed](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/ljarius-sneed-player), and that's a fact. Everybody knows that. That's why they double everything they see.\" While Kansas City has struggled against the run (it's surrendering 113.5 rushing yards per game, good for 18th in the [NFL](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl)), it has been a plausible unit on the whole, surrendering just 173.8 passing yards (third), 287.3 total yards (second) and 17.7 points (second) per game. Defensive linemen [Chris Jones](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/chris-jones-3-player) and [George Karlaftis](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/george-karlaftis-player), linebacker [Nick Bolton](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/nick-bolton-player) and the aforementioned Sneed headline Kansas City's defense. The Chiefs' issues have primarily come on the other side of the ball. While they're averaging 22.2 points per game (tied for 11th), it's their lowest offensive output since [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/patrick-mahomes-ii-player) became the full-time starting quarterback in 2018. To boot, Mahomes has thrown a career-high 14 interceptions, while boasting a 91.7 passer rating — his lowest mark as a starter. Kansas City is fresh off a 20-14 loss to the [Las Vegas Raiders](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/las-vegas-raiders-team), which saw quarterback [Aidan O'Connell](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/aidan-oconnell-player) not complete a pass after the first quarter and the Raiders' two touchdowns come on defensive scores. The Chiefs have lost five of their last eight games. Chase missed the Bengals' Week 16 loss to the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers-team) due to a shoulder injury suffered the week prior and is questionable to play against Kansas City this weekend. Cincinnati continues to roll with [Jake Browning](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jake-browning-player) at quarterback in the aftermath of [Joe Burrow](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/joe-burrow-player) suffering a season-ending wrist injury in Week 11. Across the 14 games he has appeared in this season, Chase has totaled 93 receptions for 1,156 yards and seven touchdowns. The two-time Pro Bowler and 2021 Offensive Rookie of the Year has posted 1,000-plus receiving yards in each of his three seasons in the NFL. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

    "title": "Midwesterners Can Expect Higher Heating Costs This Winter",
    "text": "Key Takeaways\nAccording to EIA, the Midwest will see fuel heating bills 2% to 11% higher under a normal winter, while a 10% colder winter will see those bills as much as 17% higher.\nBills for Midwesterners who heat their homes with natural gas are expected to see increases of 11% under normal winter temperatures.\nThose Midwesterners heating with propane will see an increase of 2% under a normal weather winter, but a colder winter will raise propane heating bills by as much as 19%.\nElectric heating bills in the Midwest are expected to rise by 6%, partly from increased demand and also as part of an overall 24% increase in electricity prices under the Biden-Harris administration.\nHomeowners can expect regulations developed by the Biden-Harris EPA to drive energy prices higher as they take effect in the future.\nAs temperatures in the Midwest are expected to be normal this winter compared to a record-setting mild winter last year, heating fuel costs are expected to rise between 2% and 11%, depending on the energy source, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). If temperatures are 10% colder than normal, energy prices in the Midwest could be as much as 17% higher. Colder weather requires more energy to keep a home at a specific temperature and can also disrupt supply through increased demand and freezing pipelines and fuel inventories. Low fuel inventories can also affect price increases.\nWinter household natural gas bills in the Midwest are forecast to average $590–11% more than last winter. Midwestern residential consumers primarily heating with natural gas are expected to consume 60 thousand cubic feet of natural gas this winter—11% higher than the estimated 54 thousand cubic feet of natural gas used last winter. Over the past two years, U.S. natural gas stockpiles have typically exceeded the five-year average; however, they are now nearing typical levels. This year, natural gas consumption in the United States has increased, particularly in the electricity sector, where demand is rising and natural gas is the dominant source of generation. Additionally, natural gas production has decreased due to voluntary cutbacks by several companies in response to low market prices.\nMidwestern residential propane users are expected to see expenditures increase by 2% from last winter due to an 11% increase in consumption. That increase in consumption is partly offset by EIA’s forecast of 8% lower retail propane prices in the Midwest this winter. If it turns out to be 10% colder than normal this winter, however, EIA expects a 19% increase in Midwest household expenditures for propane. In the case of electricity, EIA expects Midwesterners’ residential electricity expenditures to increase by 6% under normal weather conditions.\nEIA’s Forecast for National Heating Expenditures\nOn average, nationwide, EIA expects little change in heating costs this winter as colder than expected weather on average balances out lower expected energy prices. Nationwide, EIA expects residential heating costs to be 1% higher for natural gas and 2% higher for electricity—the two primary heating fuels—under normal weather conditions. In the case of temperatures 10% colder, residential natural gas expenditures for heating would be 7% higher, and for electricity, 6% higher. Under normal temperatures, propane heating expenditures are expected to be about the same as last year, and oil heating expenditures are expected to be 5% lower. If temperatures are 10% colder, however, residential propane expenditures for heating are expected to be 13% higher, and for oil, 5% higher. Propane is used as a heating fuel in 5% of U.S. households, mostly in rural areas, and heating oil is the primary space heating fuel for 4% of U.S. households, principally in the Northeast.\nNot All Forecasters Agree with EIA\nAccording to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, residential home heating costs will be higher this winter nationwide. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association represents the state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). It estimates that home heating costs, on average, for this winter to increase by 10.5% from last year primarily due to a colder winter in the Northeast and Midwest, with expenditures increasing from $889 to $982.\nFor households using electricity to heat their homes, expenditures are expected to increase from $1,063 to $1,208—a 13.6% increase. Electric prices have increased 24% under the Biden-Harris administration and are expected to continue increasing due to increased consumption from AI demand centers and the Biden-Harris administration’s plan to electrify everything from autos to gas stoves to heating devices and its regulatory assault on the roughly 60% of electric generation represented by coal and natural gas. Electricity is one of the fastest-growing indexes in the September 2024 Consumer Price Index.\nThe association also expects higher prices for natural gas, with average residential heating expenditures increasing from $601 to $644. Households that use heating oil are projected to see a 6.1% rise in expenses, moving from $1,851 to $1,963, largely due to higher consumption linked to colder weather in the Northeast. Meanwhile, families relying on propane can expect a 7.3% increase in their costs, rising from $1,343 last winter to $1,442 this year for comparable reasons.\nAll Energy Prices Have Increased Under the Biden-Harris Administration\nThe Biden-Harris administration has instituted onerous regulations on the fossil fuel industry, pushing its politically correct technologies under the guise that they will eventually be cheaper and even providing them with lucrative subsidies paid by American taxpayers. However, after almost four years of the Biden-Harris administration, the opposite has been the case. As mentioned above, residential electricity prices have increased by 24% since Biden took office, residential natural gas prices have increased by 32%, and gasoline prices by over 50%.\nIER has documented 250 ways that the Biden-Harris administration, along with Democrat friends in Congress, has made it harder to produce oil and gas in the United States, from removing acreage from leasing to increasing royalties and other fees on oil and gas producers. The Biden-Harris power plant rule has been designed to force coal plants to retire prematurely since carbon capture technology is not yet commercially available to keep the plants within the 90% reduction of carbon dioxide that the regulation demands. That regulation also applies to new natural gas plants that are needed to ensure reliable power for AI and the Biden-Harris climate plan to electrify everything. The Biden-Harris EPA plans to provide a new regulation for reducing carbon dioxide from existing natural gas plans by the end of the year, which could have a major impact on the electric grid’s reliability.\nConclusion\nThere are differing forecasts for residential heating expenditures this winter, with EIA saying that the increased demand from colder weather essentially will be balanced out by lower prices, on average, across the nation. The exception is in the Midwest where the agency sees home heating expenditures increasing by 2 to 11%, depending on the fuel, and assuming normal weather, compared to the mild weather last year. However, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association sees home heating expenditures increasing by 10.5% nationwide this winter and assuming normal weather, but recognizing that energy prices have been increasing fairly continuously under the Biden-Harris administration.\nBiden and Harris have been instrumental in increasing energy prices through regulatory activity, promoting legislation, and signing executive orders that move the United States from domestic energy production to supporting a major foe, China, which dominates the supply chains for the green technologies that support the administration’s climate initiatives and its UN promises under the Paris Accord. Harris has provided the tie-breaking vote for 33 bills in the Senate, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which is handing out massive subsidies to clean technologies, estimated in the trillions.",

    "text": "VALLADOLID.— Familias desesperadas de última hora para cortar árboles, asegurar ventanas de cristal, amarrar tinacos, techos de láminas y todo objeto que pudiera representar un peligro por el impacto del huracán “Beryl”, es lo que se observó ayer, a horas del azote del fenómeno meteorológico. En lo referente a las ventas, se intensificó un poco más el movimiento en las tiendas, hay escasez de sogas, cinta canela, paños de madera de triplay, velas, veladoras, aunque alguno comercios anunciaron que resurtieron su inventario sobre todo de autoservicio. Ayer por la mañana y parte del día, aprovechando que aún no había llegado el huracán, muchas personas se la pasaron asegurando su patrimonio, como puertas y ventanas de cristal, amarrando tinacos, compresores de aires acondicionados, poda y corte de árboles entre otras cosas. En algunos puntos de la ciudad se observó que la gente ponía paños de triplay en puertas y ventanas, cinta canela para evitar que las astillas se dispersen en caso de que los vientos o algún proyectil rompan los vidrios. De la misma manera estuvieron ocupados amarrando láminas de algunos techos, aunque se observó que muchos no tuvieron el tiempo de atender ese asunto porque se encontraban trabajando. En las tiendas se observó un mayor número de compradores, pero no se consideró como compras de pánico, según dijo Protección Civil, porque desde el transcurso de la semana han acudido las familias a realizar sus compras, ya que ya hay una mejor cultura de prevención ahora, en comparación con años anteriores, incluso no compran víveres en exceso, solo lo indispensable. Se averiguó que muchos productos ya escaseaban, como sogas, cintas, madera, galletas, pan blanco, entre otros, aunque algunas empresas durante el día de ayer se resurtieron, sobre todo de autoservicio, aprovechando que aún había las condiciones para hacerlo. El Sistema de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado del Municipio de Valladolid (Sapamv) anunció que a las seis de la tarde se apagarían las bombas de agua potable, a fin de evitar algún desperfecto por la suspensión de la energía eléctrica y se reconectarán apenas haya las condiciones para hacerlo. En cuando a la energía eléctrica, se dijo que a las doce de la noche se suspendería, aunque empleados de la CFE dijeron que se bajarán las cuchillas de la subestación en cuanto haya riesgo de afectación a la sociedad y la infraestructura de la empresa, todo dependerá de la fuerza de los vientos que traiga el ciclón. En Tizimín, las autoridades municipales, poco después de las 5 de la tarde habilitaron el primer refugio temporal en la escuela primaria “Francisco Alcalá Martín” ubicada en la calle 42 entre 49-b y 51 con capacidad hasta para 250 personas. Las autoridades municipales, Protección Civil y Policía Municipal realizaron un recorrido en este espacio para verificar las condiciones y que todo esté listo para recibir a quienes puedan requerirlo por las lluvias que se avecinaban. El alcalde Pedro Couoh dijo que también habría personal del ayuntamiento en las comisarías de Tixcancal, Chan Cenote y Popolnah para auxiliarlos en caso de ser necesario. La policía puso a disposición el número 9861200520 para quienes tengan alguna emergencia durante la noche y el tiempo del paso del huracán por la Península. En el Sur del estado, en donde se pronosticaba un impacto mayor del ciclón, algunas comunidades como Peto, Tekax y Hunucmá recibieron la visita del gobernador Mauricio Vila Dosal. En Peto Ejecutivo estatal inspeccionó en sus visitas los albergues que se habilitaron para gente que fue desalojada de zonas vulnerables. Al aterrizar, Vila caminó dos cuadras hasta llegar al jardín de niños María Amada Cárdenas, donde fue recibido por el alcalde Renán Jiménez Tah. La reunión fue privada, no se les dio acceso a los medios de comunicación, pero trascendió que la finalidad de la visita del funcionario estatal, fue la de recorrer el refugio y ver que esté listo para atender a las familias que llegaran.— Juan Antonio Osorio Osorno / Isauro Chi Díaz / Miguel Ángel Moo Góngora",

    "text": "Prevê-se que as temperaturas se mantenham 28 graus acima da média em partes da Antárctida oriental durante os próximos 10 dias. A estação do Pólo Sul regista o mês de Julho mais quente desde 2002. As temperaturas no solo da Antárctida oriental subiram mais de 28 graus Celsius acima da média, na segunda grande vaga de calor que aflige a região nos últimos dois anos. Esta vaga de calor histórico poderá persistir por mais 10 dias e é um exemplo assustador dos grandes picos de temperatura que este clima polar poderá registar com maior frequência num mundo em aquecimento. \"Esta onda de calor é um evento quase recorde (ou recorde) para a região da Antárctida, onde está a ter o maior impacto\", disse Edward Blanchard, um cientista atmosférico da Universidade de Washington, num email. \"A grande pegada da onda de calor é também notável\", uma vez que cobre uma grande secção da Antárctida oriental, que constitui a maior parte do continente. A onda de calor ocorre a meio do Inverno antárctico, pelo que as temperaturas ainda rondam os 20 graus Celsius negativos. Ainda assim, a anomalia de temperatura na Antárctida é a maior do globo, de acordo com os modelos meteorológicos. Prevê-se que as temperaturas se mantenham entre os 20 a 30 graus Celsius acima da média em partes da Antárctida oriental durante os próximos 10 dias. Têm estado substancialmente acima da média, com mais 10 graus Celsius, se considerarmos todo o mês Julho, mas não tão elevadas como agora. Na semana passada, subiram para 12 graus acima da média. A estação do Pólo Sul vai registar o mês de Julho mais quente desde 2002, cerca de 6,3 graus Celsius acima da média, de acordo com o analista de temperatura da Antárctida, Stefano Di Battista. De 20 a 30 de Julho, a temperatura média na estação foi de 47,6 graus negativos, uma temperatura típica do final de Fevereiro — o final do Verão na Antárctida. Vostok, no centro da camada de gelo oriental, registará o mês de Julho mais quente desde 2009, com 6,5 Celsius acima da média. \"A onda de calor no planalto Antárctico é extraordinária, mais pela sua duração do que pela sua intensidade, embora alguns valores sejam notáveis\", disse Di Battista por email. Embora grande parte do continente tenha estado excepcionalmente quente, uma vaga no Norte trouxe um frio extremo no início de Julho. No dia 17, por exemplo, as estações meteorológicas do Domo Fuji caíram para -82,1 graus Celsius, a segunda temperatura mais fria de Julho de que há registo. Uma porta do frigorífico aberta As temperaturas de Inverno na Antárctida flutuam substancialmente devido à falta de luz solar , mas esta onda de calor é um desvio da norma muito maior do que o habitual. É demasiado cedo para determinar todas as suas causas, mas os cientistas dizem que pode estar, pelo menos parcialmente, ligada a processos que ocorrem a 30 quilómetros acima da superfície, na estratosfera. A estratosfera contém uma forte faixa de ar frio e baixa pressão que gira em torno de cada pólo, conhecida como vórtice polar. O vórtice é tipicamente forte e estável durante o Inverno no hemisfério sul, disse Amy Butler, uma cientista atmosférica da Administração Nacional Oceânica e Atmosférica. Mas este ano, disse ela, foi sacudido por ondas atmosféricas, enfraquecendo o vórtice e fazendo subir as temperaturas a grande altitude; isto é conhecido como um evento súbito de aquecimento estratosférico. \"A principal razão pela qual é notável é o facto de ser normalmente uma altura do ano relativamente calma para o vórtice polar do hemisfério sul\", disse Butler. Este fenómeno conduziu a alguns recordes de temperatura na estratosfera. Os dados mostram que o súbito aquecimento da estratosfera também está a afectar a baixa atmosfera. O aquecimento enfraqueceu a cintura de ventos de oeste à volta da Antárctida, normalmente designada por corrente de jacto. Isto permitiu que o ar gelado normalmente confinado perto do Pólo Sul se desviasse para norte, em direcção à Nova Zelândia, ao Sul de África e ao Sul da América do Sul, como uma porta de frigorífico entreaberta. Como o frio profundo escapou da Antárctida Oriental, as temperaturas subiram drasticamente em resposta. As pressões atmosféricas sobre a Antárctida oriental também estão a subir para níveis \"absolutamente loucos\", escreveu no Twitter Ben Noll, um meteorologista baseado na Nova Zelândia. \"O tempo no hemisfério sul está um pouco selvagem neste momento!\", comentou. Vários outros factores podem estar a contribuir para intensificar a onda de calor. A cobertura de gelo marinho da Antárctida é a segunda mais baixa de que há registo para esta época do ano — apenas um pouco acima dos níveis recorde registados em 2023. O gelo marinho ajuda a manter as regiões polares frescas, reflectindo a luz solar para o espaço. Também ajuda a manter o ar fresco, actuando como uma barreira entre o ar mais frio e as águas que têm estado excepcionalmente quentes este ano. \"É provável que a existência de menos gelo marinho e de um oceano Antárctico mais quente em torno do continente 'carregue os dados' para um Inverno mais quente na Antárctida\", afirmou Blanchard. Deste ponto de vista, pode ser um pouco \"menos surpreendente\" ver grandes ondas de calor na Antárctida este ano, em comparação com um ano \"normal\" com condições médias de gelo marinho\". Os cientistas dizem que também é difícil ignorar que o mundo inteiro tem registado um calor recorde desde Julho passado, excedendo consistentemente uma média de 1,5 graus Celsius de aquecimento acima da era pré-industrial. No entanto, à medida que o globo aquece, os pólos estão a aquecer a um ritmo ainda mais rápido. Dados recentes sobre plataformas de gelo e os cálculos com modelos mostram que a Antárctida está a aquecer duas vezes mais depressa do que a média global. Com o aumento das temperaturas globais, isso aumenta a potencial \"linha de base\" para as temperaturas médias, explica David Mikolajczyk, meteorologista investigador da Universidade de Wisconsin-Madison. Consequentemente, \"episódios de forte aquecimento como este podem ocorrer com mais frequência e ter um impacto maior\". A maior onda de calor na Antárctida — e em qualquer parte do mundo — ocorreu em Março de 2022, quando a costa oriental da Antárctida atingiu, pelo menos, 39 Celsius acima do normal. \"Infelizmente, estas ondas de calor estão a tornar-se cada vez menos surpreendentes para mim nos últimos anos, quando ocorreram vários destes fenómenos\", lamenta Sergi Gonzàlez Herrero, cientista atmosférico do Instituto WSL para a Investigação da Neve e das Avalanches.",

Per rimanere competitivi sul mercato del lavoro, ai lavoratori \\xe8 infatti richiesto un aggiornamento e un potenziamento continuo delle proprie competenze. L\\u2019uso efficace degli strumenti digitali costituisce un fattore abilitante al mondo del lavoro senza il quale non pu\\xf2 essere garantita al meglio l\\u2019occupabilit\\xe0 dei cittadini. A ci\\xf2 si unisce una esigenza connessa all\\u2019uso di tecnologie emergenti e all\\u2019integrazione di tecnologie digitali avanzate come, ad esempio: l\\u2019intelligenza artificiale (AI), la realt\\xe0 virtuale (VR), l\\u2019Internet delle cose, il cloud computing, etc.\n\\nPer guidare le imprese nella transizione digitale e, in particolare, nell\\u2019adozione dell\\u2019intelligenza artificiale e della realt\\xe0 virtuale, \\xe8 necessario non solo potenziare le competenze dei lavoratori ma anche guidare la transizione che, se non adeguatamente accompagnata, pu\\xf2 generare effetti \\u201cnegativi\\u201d sui processi e sulle attivit\\xe0 lavorative.\n\\n\\n Il progetto European Learning Experience Platform \\u2013 EULEP \\nObiettivo del progetto europeo EULEP \\u2013 finanziato dal programma Erasmus+ e in corso di realizzazione \\u2013 \\xe8 quello di mettere a punto un\\u2019offerta di formazione utile a potenziare le competenze di chi opera in azienda , con riferimento all\\u2019intelligenza artificiale e alla realt\\xe0 virtuale, fruibile attraverso una piattaforma di apprendimento centrata sulla personalizzazione dei percorsi.\n\\nIl progetto riunisce organizzazioni con background diversi come camere di commercio e industria, fornitori di Istruzione e Formazione Professionale, mondo accademico, Istituti di ricerca e autorit\\xe0 pubbliche provenienti da 8 paesi europei: Austria, Belgio, Cipro, Francia, Italia, Lettonia, Spagna, Turchia. Il partenariato italiano \\xe8 composto da Inapp, Unioncamere, IFOA e Universit\\xe0 di Genova.\n\\nNell\\u2019ambito del progetto \\xe8 stata condotta un\\u2019indagine sui livelli di digitalizzazione di 717 imprese ( 53 quelle italiane coinvolte) , i cui risultati non si scostano da quelli di Eurostat [1] riferiti al 2023 [2] , nonostante la diversit\\xe0 e l\\u2019estensione del campione di riferimento (27 Paesi contro gli 8 di Eulep). Di seguito riportiamo le principali evidenze.\n\\n Bassa maturit\\xe0 digitale delle imprese europee \\n Solo il 38% degli intervistati ha dichiarato di avere all\\u2019interno dell\\u2019azienda un reparto, una unit\\xe0 organizzativa o un membro del personale, dedicato specificatamente alla gestione e allo sviluppo delle tecnologie dell\\u2019informazione (IT). Considerando che le aziende pi\\xf9 avanzate nella digitalizzazione sono quelle che possono contare su personale specializzato, si pu\\xf2 arguire che il livello di digitalizzazione delle imprese non sia molto elevato.\n\\n Una nota negativa viene anche dall\\u2019investimento in tecnologia (hardware, software, connessione Internet, ecc.), dato che il 69% dei rispondenti ha speso meno di 10.000 euro nell\\u2019anno precedente l\\u2019intervista. Pi\\xf9 in dettaglio, il 27% ha speso meno di 3000 euro, il 42% tra 3000 e 10000 euro e solo il 31% pi\\xf9 di 10000.\n\\nLa tecnologia digitale pi\\xf9 diffusa tra tutte le aziende intervistate \\xe8 decisamente il sito web (82%). Alta anche la percentuale di coloro che dispongono di un software gestionale intern o (70%), di uno per l\\u2019 analisi dei dati (57%) e che utilizzano il cloud computing (51%). Al contrario, solo meno della met\\xe0 degli intervistati dispone di tecnologie come CRM (47%), app mobili (42%), machine learning (39%), e-commerce (35%), rilevamento delle anomalie (33%), sistemi di fidelizzazione (33%), previsioni, ottimizzazione dei prezzi e processo decisionale (27%) e internet of things (22%).\n\\nIn termini di digitalizzazione, si evidenziano quindi situazioni che indicano complessivamente una bassa maturit\\xe0 digitale , se si considera che meno della met\\xe0 delle aziende intervistate ha una persona o una unit\\xe0 organizzativa responsabile dell\\u2019IT e la maggior parte investe troppo poco in tecnologia.\n\\nInoltre, per quanto riguarda la tecnologia utilizzata, si fa soprattutto ricorso a siti web e processi di gestione interna, che allo stato attuale appartengono alla categoria delle tecnologie di base , mentre le tecnologie pi\\xf9 avanzate (come quelle che coinvolgono l\\u2019AI o la VR), sono ancora molto poco diffuse.\n\\n Servono lavoratori al passo con l\\u2019innovazione \\nL\\u2019indagine ha affrontato anche il tema della gestione delle risorse umane e dei modelli di sviluppo delle competenze dei dipendenti dell\\u2019impresa. Da questo punto di vista il 51% delle aziende intervistate effettua regolarmente una valutazione delle competenze dei propri dipendenti. Guardando ai risultati per Paese, la media varia notevolmente: in Italia, l\\u201981% delle aziende ha effettuato valutazioni periodiche delle competenze, seguita da Francia (73%), Spagna (63%), Belgio (58%), Turchia (49,8%), Cipro (46,2%), Austria (37,7%) e Lettonia (32%).\n\\nIl 50% delle aziende dichiara inoltre di avere una funzione dedicata allo sviluppo delle competenze del personale, anche in questo caso con una variazione significativa per Paese. Le aziende Belghe dichiarano di averne nel 68% dei casi, seguiti da Spagna (63%), Italia (59%), Cipro (53,8%), Turchia (48%), Francia (46%), Lettonia (42%) e Austria (39%).\n\\nUna ampia maggioranza delle imprese (73%) dichiara che la propria azienda trarrebbe vantaggio dall\\u2019aggiornamento o dalla riqualificazione del personale in tema di IT, contro il 27% che non la pensa allo stesso modo. Il 68% degli intervistati ritiene inoltre che i propri dipendenti non siano sufficientemente formati in materia di IT e il 53% ritiene che i dipendenti non abbiano competenze informatiche sufficienti per il lavoro che svolgono. Infine, il 62% dichiara di aver offerto formazione ai propri dipendenti nell\\u2019anno precedente le interviste (2021).\n\\n Poche aziende usano l\\u2019IA, ma molte pensano di farlo in futuro \\nDopo le domande relative alle politiche formative, i quesiti hanno avuto come obiettivo quello di far emergere quanto le aziende siano consapevoli dell\\u2019adozione dell\\u2019IA e della VR e quante di esse stiano effettivamente utilizzando queste nuove tecnologie e quali, infine, siano gli eventuali impedimenti.\n\\n Dall\\u2019indagine \\xe8 emerso che solo il 21% delle imprese intervistate fa ricorso a soluzioni di intelligenza artificiale. La Turchia \\xe8 il Paese con il minor utilizzo, di contro, l\\u2019Austria e l\\u2019Italia sono invece pi\\xf9 avanti rispetto agli altri Paesi con rispettivamente il 39% e il 45%.\n\\nTra le aziende che utilizzano soluzioni di intelligenza artificiale, si distingue un 69% che fa ricorso a software con intelligenza artificiale e un 27% che sviluppa invece soluzioni di intelligenza artificiale.\n\\nLa tendenza \\xe8 simile in tutti i paesi, ad eccezione di Cipro, Francia e Italia, dove c\\u2019\\xe8 una quota leggermente pi\\xf9 alta di sviluppatori di soluzioni di intelligenza artificiale.\n\\nTra le aziende che non utilizzano soluzioni di intelligenza artificiale (il 79% delle imprese intervistate), il 53% dichiara che questa non presenta un campo di applicazione in azienda. Circa un terzo dichiara di non sapere come introdurla o di non conoscerne i vantaggi. Da notare che la mancanza di competenze della forza lavoro aziendale \\xe8 all\\u2019ultimo posto come motivazione (14%).\n\\nIl fatto che oltre la met\\xe0 degli intervistati dichiari che non esiste un campo di applicazione dell\\u2019intelligenza artificiale in azienda, sta ad indicare una mancanza di consapevolezza sull\\u2019ampia gamma di soluzioni disponibili.\n\\nPer le aziende che utilizzano l\\u2019intelligenza artificiale (21%), i processi in cui questa \\xe8 maggiormente presente sono la gestione economica seguita, a ruota, dalla gestione dei servizi e/o della produzione e dal marketing digitale.\n\\n\\xc8 interessante notare che, indipendentemente dal fatto che le aziende utilizzino o meno soluzioni di intelligenza artificiale, c\\u2019\\xe8 una percezione generale (54% degli intervistati) che questa possa migliorare la produttivit\\xe0 e l\\u2019efficienza in azienda.\n\\nIl 43% degli intervistati dichiara infatti che \\xe8 un vantaggio, mentre solo il 2% la considera una minaccia. Il dato pi\\xf9 interessante in questo senso \\xe8 che la maggioranza delle imprese intervistate (55%) dichiara di non essere in grado, in questo momento, di prefigurare se queste tecnologie possono essere valutate come una opportunit\\xe0 per il futuro o, invece, come una possibile minaccia.\n\\nIl 62% intende utilizzare l\\u2019intelligenza artificiale in un prossimo futuro , anche se circa la met\\xe0 dei rispondenti dichiara di aver bisogno di riqualificare, o aggiornare, i propri dipendenti o ricercarne di nuovi in possesso del giusto know how. Il 38% dichiara invece di non voler adottare o aumentare l\\u2019uso dell\\u2019intelligenza artificiale in impresa.\n\\n Poche aziende fanno ricorso alla realt\\xe0 virtuale \\nIn relazione invece alla realt\\xe0 virtuale, la stragrande maggioranza degli intervistati (86%) dichiara che la propria azienda non utilizza questo tipo di soluzioni. Intorno a questi valori medi esiste per\\xf2 una certa variabilit\\xe0 tra paese e paese con l\\u2019Italia, ad esempio, con il 42% degli intervistati che ha risposto positivamente, e all\\u2019opposto la Turchia con solo l\\u20198%.\n\\n Si fa ricorso alla realt\\xe0 virtuale principalmente come utenti (73%) e non come sviluppatori di soluzioni specifiche.\n\\nIl 12% utilizza questa tecnologia per la gestione del servizio e/o della produzione, il 9% per il marketing e la promozione digitale, il 6% rispettivamente per la formazione del personale e l\\u2019e-commerce e il 4% per i manuali utente.\n\\nTra coloro che non la utilizzano, il 52% dichiara che l\\u2019azienda non ha un campo di applicazione dedicato, il 34% non sa come introdurla nel modello di business o nei processi aziendali e il 14% che la forza lavoro non ha le competenze necessarie.\n\\nAllo stesso tempo, alle aziende \\xe8 stato chiesto quali potrebbero essere gli utilizzi futuri delle tecnologie di realt\\xe0 virtuale. In questo senso il 18% vede possibili applicazioni nel marketing e nella promozione digitale, il 17% nella gestione dei servizi e nella produzione, il 13% nella formazione del personale, l\\u201911% nell\\u2019e-commerce, l\\u20198% per i rapporti con l\\u2019utente e il 6% per la realizzazione della manualistica utente. \\xc8 importante sottolineare come il 27% degli intervistati non sa, al momento, in cosa possano essere utilizzate in futuro le tecnologie di VR o, afferma, che non la userebbe in nessun caso (4%).\n\\n Necessaria pi\\xf9 formazione in IA e VR \\nIl numero di aziende che ha intrapreso attivit\\xe0 formative su questi temi \\xe8 piuttosto contenuto; infatti, solo il 7% dichiara di aver formato i propri dipendenti in relazione all\\u2019intelligenza artificiale e il 6% alla realt\\xe0 virtuale.\n\\nAllo stesso tempo, gli intervistati ritengono che vi sia una chiara necessit\\xe0 di formazione su entrambi i temi , con una maggiore necessit\\xe0 per quelli connessi l\\u2019AI. Rispettivamente il 76% e il 61% degli intervistati ha indicato che c\\u2019\\xe8 un bisogno da moderato a estremo di formazione nell\\u2019AI (34% di necessit\\xe0 estrema) e VR (20% estrema).\n\\nLe aziende sembrano riconoscere una necessit\\xe0 di sviluppare competenze connesse a questi temi dichiarando, nel 63% dei casi, di voler pianificare in futuro azioni formative per i propri dipendenti.\n\\nAlle aziende \\xe8 stato anche richiesto quale a loro avviso dovesse essere il livello degli interventi formativi da proporre all\\u2019interno delle proprie aziende. Il 61% degli intervistati ha dichiarato che la formazione dovrebbe essere mirata ad un livello iniziale, mentre Il 27% ritiene che sia necessario operare con interventi di livello intermedio e, infine, l\\u201911% ritiene che si debba intervenire con proposte di livello avanzato.\n\\nIn merito al contenuto delle competenze da sviluppare, le pi\\xf9 richiesto risultano essere quelle relative all\\u2019uso di tecnologie di machine learning (23% degli intervistati), alla programmazione (21%), ai big data (17%), alla modellazione informatica (13%), alla realt\\xe0 virtuale (12%), alla robotica (9%).\n\\n Un ultimo aspetto indagato \\xe8 stato quello etico. Per gli intervistati, le principali preoccupazioni sono connesse al tema della privacy e alla protezione dei dati (27%), alla fiducia e alla sicurezza (24%) e alla responsabilit\\xe0 (20%).\n\\nAlle aziende \\xe8 stato chiesto anche di valutare l\\u2019attuale livello di competenze del proprio personale rispetto all\\u2019etica nell\\u2019utilizzo di queste tecnologie. Lo ritengono insufficiente il 33% per quanto attiene l\\u2019intelligenza artificiale e il 36% riguardo la realt\\xe0 virtuale.\n\\n Focus sulle imprese italiane \\nConcentrandosi solo sui rispondenti italiani, il 56,6% delle aziende intervistate dichiara di avere nella propria organizzazione staff dedicati all\\u2019IT. Il 62,3% di queste, nell\\u2019ultimo anno, ha investito (oltre i 10.000 euro) in tecnologia (hardware, software, connessione Internet, ecc.).\n\\n Le soluzioni IT vengono soprattutto utilizzate dalle aziende per il web, i l data analysis e l\\u2019internal management. Dai risultati delle interviste, il 49,1% delle imprese dichiara di utilizzare l\\u2019intelligenza artificiale, mentre il 41,5% dichiara di utilizzare le tecnologie connesse alla realt\\xe0 virtuale. Nei casi in cui i rispondenti abbiano dichiarato di non utilizzare queste tecnologie, i motivi possono essere ricondotti alla mancanza di campi di applicazione nelle aziende, alla mancanza di competenze specifiche e alla mancanza di conoscenza su come introdurre tali soluzioni nei processi aziendali.\n\\n I processi aziendali in cui risulta esserci una maggiore propensione all\\u2019utilizzo dell\\u2019AI sono: la gestione dei servizi e dei prodotti erogati dall\\u2019azienda, la gestione della produzione, il marketing e la promozione digitale. In via residuale, al momento l\\u2019AI trova applicazione in specifiche attivit\\xe0 come il monitoraggio finalizzato alla predittivit\\xe0 dei macchinari, lo sviluppo di applicazioni, la produzione di contenuti multimediali, l\\u2019esecuzione di processi di riconciliazione amministrativa, la \\u201csensoristica indossabile\\u201d, lo sviluppo di soluzioni personalizzate per i clienti e lo sviluppo di applicazioni specifiche di tipo settoriale.\n\\n Anche per la VR gli ambiti di maggiore impiego nei processi aziendali delle imprese italiane intervistate risultano essere quello della gestione del servizio e del prodotto, della gestione della produzione e del marketing digitale . Si segnalano a titolo esemplificativo alcune applicazioni specifiche come la creazione di ambienti immersivi per la promozione turistica e culturale, Handbook per installazioni hardware e software, gestione di interventi manutentivi complessi, sviluppo di applicazioni e produzione di contenuti multimediali, sistemi per \\u201cremotizzare\\u201d i contatti del personale.\n\\nIn linea generale il 66% delle imprese italiane intervistate ritiene che la maggior parte del personale sia sufficientemente formato in materia di IT e quasi la totalit\\xe0 degli intervistati afferma che il miglioramento delle competenze IT, o la riqualificazione del personale, possa portare vantaggi all\\u2019azienda. Per quanto riguarda la necessit\\xe0 di competenze connesse direttamente alle tecnologie per l\\u2019applicazione dell\\u2019AI e la VR le aziende hanno dichiarato un fabbisogno alto o molto alto in circa il 50 % dei casi per l\\u2019AI e circa il 30% dei casi per la VR.\n\\nDi seguito la tabella che riassume le percentuali complessive ottenute dalle due domande.\n\\n Tabella x.

Di contro, la diffusione delle tecnologie connesse all\\u2019AI e alla VR appare ancora molto limitata.\n\\nUn dato che pi\\xf9 di altri ci sembra importante sottolineare \\xe8 quello relativo alle difficolt\\xe0 connesse, ancora prima che all\\u2019introduzione in azienda di queste tecnologie, alla percezione che i rispondenti hanno dell\\u2019utilit\\xe0, delle potenzialit\\xe0 e delle opportunit\\xe0, che queste tecnologie possono generare.\n\\nDa questo punto di vista \\xe8 importante ricordare che solo il 21% delle aziende ha dichiarato di fare uso di tecnologie di AI e di VR. Di contro il 79% delle imprese intervistate ha dichiarto di non farne uso e di queste, poco pi\\xf9 della met\\xe0 (53%) dichiara di non sapere quale potrebbe essere il campo di applicazione nella propria azienda, pi\\xf9 di un terzo dichiara di non sapere come introdurle o di non conoscerne i vantaggi.\n\\nQuesti risultati indicano come al momento il fabbisogno pi\\xf9 urgente sembra essere connesso a competenze che facilitino l\\u2019individuazione e l\\u2019introduzione in impresa di soluzioni tecnologiche di efficientamento dei processi di lavoro piuttosto che competenze specifiche riferite all\\u2019uso delle tecnologie dell\\u2019AI e della VR.\n\\n Fattori che possono ostacolare sviluppo e adozione di IA e VR \\n L\\u2019indagine ha consentito di individuare alcuni fattori che possono ostacolare pi\\xf9 di altri lo sviluppo e l\\u2019implementazione di queste tecnologie . Il primo \\xe8 riferito proprio agli imprenditori, soprattutto delle PMI europee, che potrebbero non disporre delle competenze digitali necessarie ad attuare iniziative di trasformazione. A questo \\xe8 necessario associare fattori di natura culturale, come ad esempio la resistenza al cambiamento, che pu\\xf2 portare a preferire le pratiche aziendali tradizionali.\n\\nUn ulteriore tema \\xe8 quello relativo all\\u2019integrazione con i sistemi gia esistenti in impresa, che pu\\xf2 essere un fattore di difficile gestione soprattutto quando i sistemi pre-esistenti risultano obsoleti e difficili da aggiornare o sostituire.\n\\nAnche attrarre e trattanere lavoratori qualificati capaci di progettare, implementare, gestire e sviluppare, soluzioni digitali avanzate pu\\xf2 costituire un fattore di criticit\\xe0 soprattutto per le PMI . Questi lavoratori, peraltro, costituiscono spesso anche il tramite con cui accedere alle opportunit\\xe0 finanziare, come le sovvenzioni governative o il credito bancario, per sostenere le iniziative di trasformazione digitale dell\\u2019impresa.\n\\n \\n\n\\n Bibliografia \\nBezegov\\xe1, E., Ledgard A.M., Molemaker, R.J., Ober\\u010d, B.P., Vigkos, A.

    "text": "Las rachas de viento podrían superar los 70 kilómetros por hora (km/h), poniendo en riesgo a zonas pobladas y tramos carreteros de la entidad.\nCondiciones esperadas para este fin de semana Viernes 1 de noviembre: Los primeros efectos de este frente frío se manifestarán con ráfagas de viento de más de 45 km/h en localidades como Ahumada, Ascensión, Gómez Farías, Namiquipa, Temósachic, Matachí, Bachíniva, Guerrero, Carichí, Cuauhtémoc, entre otros municipios. Además, se prevén lluvias aisladas en zonas como Ojinaga, Manuel Benavides, Juárez y Coyame.\nSábado 2 de noviembre: Con el ingreso directo del frente frío, se espera que los vientos moderen su velocidad a 35 km/h en municipios como Ahumada, Temósachic y Guachochi. Sin embargo, se mantiene la posibilidad de precipitaciones aisladas en algunas áreas.\nDomingo 3 de noviembre: Para el cierre del fin de semana, los vientos retomarán fuerza, alcanzando intensidades de hasta 75 km/h en Ignacio Zaragoza, Gómez Farías, Carichí, Ascensión, Janos, Casas Grandes y otras localidades. Las rachas podrían dificultar la visibilidad y la seguridad en carretera, especialmente en las zonas de mayor altitud y exposición.\nImpacto en la región serrana y posibles riesgos La CEPC anticipa un marcado descenso de temperatura, principalmente en la Sierra Tarahumara. Durante la madrugada del domingo, los termómetros podrían registrar mínimos de hasta -1°C en Balleza, 1°C en Guachochi, y 2°C en Bocoyna, mientras que en el resto del estado, las mínimas oscilarán entre 10 y 12°C. La combinación de bajas temperaturas y vientos fuertes también podría provocar caída de aguanieve en las zonas altas de Madera y Bocoyna, así como actividad eléctrica y granizo en áreas dispersas.\nRecomendaciones de Protección Civil Ante estas condiciones, Protección Civil exhorta a la ciudadanía a tomar las siguientes precauciones:\nInformarse constantemente sobre las actualizaciones del clima y avisos oficiales. Asegurar objetos que puedan ser arrastrados por el viento, como macetas y mobiliario exterior. Evitar actividades al aire libre durante las rachas de viento intenso, especialmente en las zonas pronosticadas. Conducir con precaución en tramos carreteros expuestos a vientos fuertes. Tener a la mano lámparas de batería, agua y alimentos en caso de cortes de energía. Preparar un plan de emergencia y conocer las rutas de evacuación en zonas de riesgo. Protegerse del frío y evitar el contacto con cables eléctricos caídos . Para emergencias, Protección Civil invita a la población a comunicarse al 9-1-1 y mantenerse resguardada ante el posible impacto de este frente frío, con especial atención a las zonas serranas donde el clima será más severo.\nComparte este artículo",

    "text": "Decommissioning chairman wanted to quit in 2001 after slow progress – records\nThe three commissioners ‘did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September’, a briefing note said.\nThe chairman of the body in charge of decommissioning as part of Northern Ireland’s peace process considered standing down from the role in June 2001 after months of slow progress.\nDocuments released from Ireland’s state files this year show a “downbeat” view of the pace of attempts to ensure the IRA and other paramilitary groups disabled their arms after the Good Friday Agreement.\nOfficials from Ireland’s Department of Justice and from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) met the three commissioners of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) on June 27.\nDespite six meetings with the IRA representative since March, IICD chairman John de Chastelain said that “we are no nearer actually decommissioning”.\nWilliam Fittall of the NIO noted that, “more provocatively”, the three commissioners were proposing to be released from their roles by September 24, on its fourth anniversary.\n“John de Chastelain stressed that he and his colleagues did not want to be irresponsible or walk away from their commitments. But they had personal lives they needed to get on with.”\nHe also expressed concern about the commission’s credibility given “the impasse and growing unionist scepticism”.\n“They thought that putting the date in the public domain might produce a helpful jolt to the system.\n“Nevertheless, they were open to discussion on this. They understood that the governments might want the commission still to exist with a staff member there to answer the phones.\n“But the present three commissioners did not want to remain in Belfast beyond September.”\nMr Fittall noted that “their restlessness is something which we can exploit privately with Sinn Fein”.\nA week prior, Irish diplomat Niall Holohan recounted a meeting he had in Belfast with Clifford Garrard, who was Mr de Chastelain’s deputy.\nMr Garrard told Mr Holohan that the “waiting game” had been “an exasperating experience” for the commission.\n“Garrard was of the view furthermore that nothing less than an act of putting arms completely and verifiably beyond use would be enough to save David Trimble’s scalp on July 1,” the note said.\nIt added: “If David Trimble proceeds with his threat to resign on July 1 and the Good Friday institutions were to collapse as a result, it might prove difficult for de Chastelain to justify his continued presence in Belfast.”\nThe commission remained in place for four more years until it was verified that all IRA materiel was decommissioned.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/155/6.",
