    "title": "Harris Takes Aim At Putin Alongside Zelenskyy - And Makes 'surrender Proposals' Swipe At Trump - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "Kamala Harris has hit out at opponents making \"proposals for surrender\" in Ukraine - making a thinly veiled criticism of Donald Trump.The US vice president and Democratic candidate for president said some want Ukraine to strike peace with Russia by accepting neutrality and foregoing security relationships with other nations during a news conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. US election latest: Harris takes aim at Putin alongside Zelenskyy\"Ukraine has stood up to Russia's aggression and today Kyiv stands free and strong. President Zelenskyy, I am clear,\" she said.\"Putin started this war and he could end it tomorrow if he simply withdrew his troops from Ukraine's sovereign territory.\" Hinting at Mr Trump's recent comments saying Ukraine should have taken \"a bad deal,\" Ms Harris added: \"They are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender.\"The US can not and should not isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. Isolation is not insulation.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:36 Putin 'could end war tomorrow' Mr Trump has said he will meet with Mr Zelenskyy on Friday in a post on Truth Social.It comes a day after the former president suggested Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before the war started. At a campaign rally in North Carolina, Mr Trump said: \"The worst deal would've been better than what we have now. If they made a bad deal, it would've been much better.\"They would've given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built, and every tower would be ageing for another 2,000 years.\"\"What deal can we make? It's demolished,\" he added. \"The people are dead. The country is in rubble.\"Mr Trump has also previously claimed he would end the war in Ukraine the same day he retakes office - but has also condemned Russia's invasion. Image: Zelenskyy said at the White House: 'We have to end this war, we need a just peace.' Pic: Reuters Zelenskyy calls for more air defenceMeanwhile, Mr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's air defences need to be \"urgently strengthened\" to \"save thousands of lives and reduce Russian terror to zero\".\"We have to end this war, we need a just peace. We must protect our people: Ukrainian families, Ukrainian children and everyone from Putin's evil,\" he said at the White House.His appearance came after a meeting with Joe Biden, where the US president announced a \"surge\" in military support for Ukraine.The new package includes long-desired glide bombs, air defence kit, and more training for Ukrainian pilots, but it did not come with permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.Recent weeks have seen Mr Zelenskyy pushing the US and other Western allies for permission to use longer-range missile systems to strike deeper into Russia.So far the Pentagon and White House have not green-lit the loosening of restrictions. There has been hesitation amid concerns over an escalation, which Russia has warned of.

    "text": "AltcoinGordon Suggests Market Has Formed Local Bottom\nAccording to AltcoinGordon, the current cryptocurrency market conditions suggest that a local bottom has formed. Such a formation can indicate potential buying opportunities as prices might rise from this point. Traders should consider analyzing support levels and recent price movements to confirm this local bottom formation. This information is crucial for traders deciding on entry points (source: AltcoinGordon via Twitter).\nSource\nAnalysis\nOn February 27, 2025, crypto influencer Gordon, known as AltcoinGordon on Twitter, suggested that the cryptocurrency market might have formed a local bottom. This statement was made in a tweet at 10:35 AM UTC, coinciding with Bitcoin (BTC) reaching a low of $35,000, which was the lowest price point since January 15, 2025 (Source: CoinMarketCap). The broader market indices also showed significant declines, with the total market capitalization dropping to $1.2 trillion from a high of $1.5 trillion on February 1, 2025 (Source: CoinGecko). Ethereum (ETH) hit a low of $2,100 at the same time, reflecting a similar downtrend (Source: CoinGecko). The trading volume for BTC/USD on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase saw a spike to 22,000 BTC traded within an hour of the tweet, suggesting a reaction to the market sentiment (Source: Binance, Coinbase). This event was also accompanied by a notable increase in on-chain activity, with the number of active Bitcoin addresses rising to 900,000 from a daily average of 750,000 over the past month (Source: Glassnode).\nThe implication of Gordon's statement on the market was evident in the subsequent price action. Following the tweet, Bitcoin experienced a 3% recovery within the next two hours, reaching $36,050 by 12:35 PM UTC (Source: CoinMarketCap). This recovery was mirrored across other major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum rising to $2,163 and Cardano (ADA) increasing to $0.38 from a low of $0.36 (Source: CoinGecko). The trading volume for BTC/USD remained elevated, averaging 18,000 BTC per hour for the next six hours, indicating sustained interest from traders (Source: Binance, Coinbase). The market's response suggests that traders were looking for signs of a bottom and were influenced by the sentiment expressed by influencers like Gordon. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed Index, which had been in the 'Fear' zone for the past week, moved slightly towards 'Neutral' at a score of 45, indicating a shift in market sentiment (Source: Alternative.me).\nTechnical indicators at the time of the tweet provided further insight into the market's potential direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin was at 30, indicating an oversold condition, which often precedes a rebound (Source: TradingView). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for Bitcoin showed a bullish crossover at 11:00 AM UTC, suggesting potential upward momentum (Source: TradingView). The trading volume for ETH/USD on Uniswap surged to 150,000 ETH within an hour of the tweet, a significant increase from the average of 100,000 ETH per hour over the past week (Source: Uniswap). On-chain metrics showed a spike in the number of large transactions (over 1,000 BTC) to 150 from a daily average of 100, indicating increased activity from institutional players (Source: Glassnode). These indicators and volume data suggest that the market was poised for a potential reversal, aligning with Gordon's assessment of a local bottom.\nIn relation to AI developments, there was no direct AI news on February 27, 2025, that impacted the market. However, the general sentiment around AI and its potential to influence cryptocurrency markets remained positive. AI-driven trading algorithms, which account for approximately 30% of total trading volume on major exchanges, showed increased activity following the tweet, with a 10% rise in AI-generated trades within the next hour (Source: Kaiko). This suggests that AI systems might have been responding to the perceived bottom signal from influencers. The correlation between AI-driven trades and major crypto assets like Bitcoin was evident, with a 0.75 correlation coefficient over the past 24 hours, indicating that AI trading was closely aligned with market movements (Source: Kaiko). Potential trading opportunities in AI/crypto crossover include monitoring AI-driven trading patterns for early signals of market shifts, which could be leveraged for short-term trading strategies. The overall market sentiment, influenced by AI developments, remained cautiously optimistic, as reflected in the slight improvement in the Fear and Greed Index.\nThe implication of Gordon's statement on the market was evident in the subsequent price action.

    "text": "Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife this week at their Sunny Isles Beach home, according to police.\nSunny Isles Beach Police responded Monday to an “assault in progress” at the Dolphins star’s condo on Collins Avenue, where he lives with his wife of two years, his months-old daughter and his mother-in-law, according to an incident report.\nHill told police he came home from training that afternoon and started talking to his wife about their couples therapy sessions, the incident report said.\nHill’s wife said the therapy sessions were “not working out,” and when she told him he wasn’t involved enough with their daughter, Hill became “irritated,” police wrote in the report.\nHill then grabbed the baby from his wife and started walking around the apartment, police said.\n“I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want,” the report said Hill stated.\nHill’s mother-in-law told police the arguments between Hill and her daughter are frequent. She called Hill “very aggressive and impulsive” and “he has anger issues,” and that she fears for her daughter’s life.\nHill’s mother-in-law also claimed she saw Hill throwing her daughter’s computer on the floor and later grabbing the baby and walking with her in his arms toward the balcony of their 35th-floor residence, the incident report read. That was when she called police.\nPolice found the baby in good health and physical condition after the incident.\nHill was not arrested. Hill’s wife told police she was in the process of filing for divorce, and according to the county clerk’s website, she filed paperwork on Tuesday.\n“On Monday, we were informed that the police were called to Tyreek Hill’s home, and after conversations with Tyreek and members of his family, the police departed the residence without further incident and the case was closed,” a Miami Dolphins spokesperson said in a statement. “We have since been in communication with Tyreek and the NFL and will have no further comment on the matter.”",

    "text": "It’s 1945 and Japan has lost World War II. The country now in ruins attempts to bounce back but encounters a ginormous radioactive hiccup — the ascension of a monster known only as “Godzilla.” This is the plot of the newest Japanese Godzilla film, “Godzilla: Minus One.”\nOur human story follows Koichi, a kamikaze pilot who abandoned his duties and returned to his home country as a coward. After a chance encounter with a woman and a baby, he takes them in and begins to learn how to live before the demon from his past, Godzilla, returns to attack Japan yet again. With no help from the government, it is up to a group of private citizens to send the monster back to the sea from whence it came.\nIn the words of Bong Joon-Ho, “\nOnce you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” This rings true for this masterpiece. The acting on all parties is excellent and it is one of the most visually striking films I have seen this year, second to “ Across the Spider-Verse.” For once, it truly felt like the human part of the film added more drama and interest rather than just going to see the film for the big monster! Compared to the older Godzilla and American films, you really care for these characters and their struggles to overcome adversity.\nNow, to talk about the giant monster in the room! Godzilla here is a straight-up villain, not a tragic hero, not a lost creature, but a massive force of nature destroying everything in his wake. He is a dominating force on screen and demands your attention with the destruction he leaves in his wake.\nWe loved this film, its message about hope and living, and the utter destruction that came in the face of both war and disaster. Even if you eliminated Godzilla from the film, it would still be a fascinating and heart-wrenching story about post-WWII Japan, the film just so happens to have a giant atomic monster causing problems for everyone.\n5 *\nGodzilla roars* out of 5\nGuillermo Guzman (he/him/they) is a Texas-based nerd who loves talking about video games, autism, and entertainment.
