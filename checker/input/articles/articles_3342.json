We condemn these posts in the strongest possible terms.”\n”This matter is being reviewed by the University and is being referred to the Harvard College Administrative Board, which is responsible for the application and enforcement of undergraduate academic regulations and social conduct,” the university said. “Harvard rejects antisemitism in all of its forms.”\nHarvard Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine issued a statement apologizing for sharing the anti-Semitic graphic.\n”It has come to our attention that a post featuring antiquated cartoons which used offensive antisemitic tropes was linked to our account. We removed the content as soon as it came to our attention. We apologize for the hurt that these images have caused and do not condone them in any way,” the group wrote. “Harvard FSJP stands against all forms of hate and bigotry, including antisemitism.”\n[[RELATED: House committee requests documents from Harvard on anti-Semitism response, gives two week deadline]]https://www.campusreform.org/article/house-committee-requests-documents-from-harvard-on-anti-semitism-response-gives-two-week-deadline/24622\nIn a separate\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C3il7vOpoLg/?hl=en&img_index=1, the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee and the African and African American Resistance Organization also apologized.\n”In an earlier version of this post we shared an image that was not reflective of our values as organizations. We reiterate our unending support for solidarity between Black and Palestinian communities and have updated our post to reflect what we stand for,” the groups wrote. “Our mutual goals for liberation will always include the Jewish community- and we regret inadvertently including an image that played upon antisemitic tropes. Antisemitism has no place in the movement of Palestinian liberation, and we wholeheartedly disavow it in all its forms.”",

    "text": "(Blue Fox) Category: Anime The Massive Anime Leak Goes Beyond Just Netflix Titles Kirsten Carey | Published: Aug 8, 2024 04:58 pm\nOn August 7, 2024, there was a major anime and animation leak. The heart of the breach is centered at Netflix , where DANDAN , Terminator Zero , Arcane ‘s second season, Ranma 1/2 , Plankton: The Movie , Spellbound , and somehow even more have all leaked. However, there are a few outliers—namely, Re:ZERO ‘s upcoming third season.\nRecommended Videos Re:ZERO – Starting Life in Another World is one of the most beloved isekai series out there. Based on Tappei Nagasuki’s light novel series, Re:ZERO has spun out into countless manga series, OVAs, video games, and an anime series. It’s rather famously difficult for newcomers to figure out where to go start and what order to watch in, but that’s okay, we love it anyway.\nThe third season of the Re:ZERO anime is a huge deal. The anime kicked off in 2016 and hasn’t had a new season for three and a half years. The official premiere of the first episode is slated for August 30, 2024, and we found out at Anime Expo last month that the episode will be movie-length. They’re pulling an Oshi no Ko! Shit’s going to go down!\nThat’s all the more reason why the fact that there’s a leak is so disappointing.\nSo what happened? The vast majority of the August 7 leaks came from Netflix. But Re:ZERO is primarily licensed by Crunchyroll. It’s notable that Re:ZERO is on Netflix in countries beyond Crunchyroll’s purview, but that doesn’t seem to be the cause of this particular leak.\nInstead, the Re:ZERO leak bears the watermark from Japan Expo Paris, which took place last month, during the weekend of July 11. The film-length first episode of Re:ZERO ‘s long-awaited third season was supposed to get an advanced first screening, but the screening was canceled.\nWhether or not the leak is connected to the cancellation is unknown, but someone sure came away with something. Equally strange is the why, if the leaker had this episode a month ago, they wanted until this week’s massive deluge to unleash it. That seems to suggest that these leaks are all connected.\nThe official release of a series is something that the hundreds of people who worked on it actively look forward to. It’s disrespectful to rob them of that payoff for all their hard work. Not to mention that, as a fan, having to dodge spoilers online for something that isn’t even officially out yet is a huge bummer.\nThe first episode of Re:ZERO ‘s third season will officially drop on Crunchyroll on August 30, 2024. Just three weeks away!",

    "text": "Stolen vehicle chase from Kansas to Nebraska ends with arrest LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - A pursuit of a stolen vehicle from Kansas to Nebraska ends with a 19-year-old man in custody. Thursday at approximately 1:40 a.m., NSP learned that Kansas law enforcement authorities were in pursuit of a stolen Mercury Milan traveling northbound toward Nebraska on Highway 281. After entering Nebraska, Webster County sheriff’s deputies located the vehicle and picked up the pursuit. The vehicle turned westbound onto Highway 136. A trooper, along with a Franklin County deputy joined the pursuit as the vehicle continued fleeing through Franklin County. A Harlan County deputy was then able to successfully deploy stop sticks to bring the vehicle to a stop near the county line. The driver then fled on foot into a field. After a search utilizing a thermal drone and K9 to track the subject, the driver was located and taken into custody. Silas Cooper, 19, of Mount Airy, North Carolina, was arrested for willful reckless driving, flight to avoid arrest, theft by unlawful taking, and obstructing a peace officer. He was lodged in Harlan County Jail. [Click here](https://www.1011now.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.

    "text": "Utility Scale EDP Renewables cuts ribbon on 200 MW solar + storage park in Fresno County Paul Gerke 7.18.2024 Share EDPR North America employees cut the ribbon at Scarlet I alongside dignitaries and industry partners (courtesy: EDP Renewables) EDP Renewables North America, a leading U.S. renewable energy developer, proudly unveiled its Scarlet I Solar Energy Park (Scarlet I) in Fresno County, California Wednesday during a ribbon cutting that hosted dozens of dignitaries and industry partners. The 200 MW project, which includes a 40 MW battery energy storage system (BESS), will generate enough energy to power the equivalent of 68,000 average California homes each year. The project is actively exploring agrivoltaics possibilities, including sheep grazing on site after a recent trial run utilizing locally sourced sheep. This newest solar + storage facility builds upon EDPR NA’s existing 248 MW operational footprint in California, which is spread across three phases of the Rising Tree Wind Farm in Kern County, two phases of the Lone Valley Solar Park in San Bernardino County, and the Windhub A Solar Park in Kern County. EDPR NA also has several additional California projects in late-stage development including the 200 MW Scarlet II Solar Energy Park, which also includes 150 MW of BESS, and the 300 MW Sandrini Solar Park located in Kern County. “California remains a priority state for EDPR NA’s development efforts, and we are pleased to finalize this significant solar + storage project in The Golden State,” stated Sandhya Ganapathy, CEO of EDP Renewables North America. “Scarlet I will be a benchmark project as we look to develop additional hybrid multi-technology renewable projects across our portfolio and contribute further to grid resiliency.” GO DEEPER: Lucy Bullock-Sieger, vice president of strategy for developer Lightstar Renewables, joined Episode 46 of the Factor This! podcast to discuss a new approach to agrivoltaics.
