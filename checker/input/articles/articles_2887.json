    "title": "Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Is Getting Terrible Steam Ratings After Rough Launch",
    "text": "Another year, another flight sim from Microsoft. However, compared to 2020’s entry, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is getting destroyed in Steam reviews due to a disastrous launch.\nAs Polygon noted, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been having trouble since its launch on Tuesday. Among the most prevalent issues are long loading times and missing content. Due to these problems, the game currently has an “overwhelmingly negative” Steam rating.\nTrying to fan the flames of discontent, Microsoft Flight Simulator head Jorg Neumann blamed the massive amount of players for the mess. “We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 , but frankly, we completely underestimated how high, and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure.” Developer Asobo’s CEO, Sebastian Wloch, added that while his team tested the servers with a whopping 200,000 player simulation, the number of actual humans trying to play the title eclipsed that number. Even trying to limit the amount of gamers accessing the sim at one time proved ineffective.\nWhat exactly are players experiencing? Hours spent waiting on loading screens, crashes, and missing models and textures are just a taste of the difficulties facing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 . One user on Steam named VonBarb even quipped the simulation was too true to reality, stating, “… it now feels like Boeing was actually involved in building the servers.” Speaking as someone wary of flying on Boeing planes, this must be quite a disastrous launch.\nFor their part, both Microsoft and Asobo are planning on fixes, though they did not give a timeline for them. Regardless, the companies should have seen this coming. Microsoft Flight Simulator was a big deal in 2020, especially due to the pandemic. It was a way of experiencing the joy of flight at a time when we could not leave our homes. Though people’s lives have steadily returned to normal since then, the simulation is still a welcome break from reality. Hopefully, the team can get things back up and running soon.",

    "text": "Alors que les yeux sont tournés sur l’offensive ukrainienne dans la région de Koursk en Russie et sur l’avancée des troupes russes dans le Donbass vers la localité de Prokovsk, Kiev continue de frapper des cibles stratégiques russes. Jeudi 22 août, un ferry transportant des citernes de carburant a été visé dans un port russe situé en face de la Crimée annexée. Ce navire a finalement coulé. Publié le : Malgré l’arrivée d’une centaine de secouristes et d’un train spécial de lutte contre les incendies, le ferry, ciblé par une attaque ukrainienne dans le port russe de Kavkaz a fini par couler, jeudi 22 août. Il contenait trente citernes de carburant. « Du fait des dommages subis, le ferry a coulé dans les eaux du port de Kavkaz. Il n'y a pas de foyer d'incendie dans le port », a indiqué sur Telegram le service opérationnel de la région russe de Krasnodar (sud-ouest), qui avait dénoncé plus tôt une attaque du « régime de Kiev » contre ce navire. L’équipage était, semble-t-il, à bord lors de cette attaque dans le port de Kavkaz, situé dans le détroit de Kertch, qui sépare la Russie de la Crimée annexée par Moscou en 2014. Deux membres d'équipage du ferry sont portés disparus et 17 autres ont pu être sauvés, a indiqué le gouverneur régional, Veniamine Kondratiev. Viser des points stratégiques Après les attaques en 2022 et 2023 contre le pont reliant la Crimée au continent, Moscou avaient été obligé de trouver d'autres moyens pour ravitailler la Crimée. Ce ferry faisait partie de ces moyens de ravitaillement. L’ Ukraine continue de pilonner des cibles stratégiques avec des drones et des missiles. Les dépôts de carburant font partie des cibles prioritaires. Dimanche 18 août, Kiev avait frappé un dépôt de carburant dans la ville de Proletarsk, dans la région de Rostov. Cette attaque a provoqué un énorme incendie, qui n’était toujours pas éteint, malgré l’intervention de plusieurs centaines de pompiers et d’avions. Cette attaque avait été menée à plusieurs centaines de kilomètres de la frontière ukrainienne.

    "text": "Mental health struggles surge among Quebec’s teens 19 December 2024 at 17 h 54 min Reading time: 2 min 30 s Dr. Tina Montreuil, Associate Professor at McGill University, shared her insights on the rising mental health challenges among Québec high school students, emphasizing the importance of community support and actionable solutions (Photo : McGill University) By William Crooks\nLocal Journalism Initiative\nA newly released report from the Institut de la statistique du Québec highlights a worrying trend: a sharp rise in mental health issues among high school students over the past decade. The report, which draws on data from over 70,000 students in French and English schools across Quebec, underscores alarming increases in anxiety, depression, and other disorders—issues that experts like Dr. Tina Montreuil emphasize need urgent attention.\nDr. Montreuil, an Associate Professor in Educational and Counselling Psychology at McGill University, reflected on the findings during a recent interview. “This report provides a snapshot of how mental health among teenagers has evolved over the past ten years,” she noted. While some conditions like attention deficit disorders have long been present, new phenomena, such as eco-anxiety, have emerged as significant concerns.\nStark statistics on youth mental health\nThe report paints a grim picture: professionally diagnosed anxiety disorders rose from 9 per cent in 2010–2011 to 20 per cent in 2022–2023. Depression also climbed from 4.9 per cent to 7 per cent, and eating disorders showed the most dramatic increase, from 1.8 per cent to 5 per cent. Attention deficit disorders now affect a staggering 25 per cent of students, up from 13 per cent in 2010.\nThe data also reveals gender disparities. Girls are disproportionately affected by anxiety (8 per cent take medication compared to 3.8 per cent of boys), depression, and eco-anxiety—a newer metric that tracks stress tied to environmental concerns. The decline in self-esteem was also more pronounced in girls, dropping from 15 per cent in 2010 to just 7 per cent in 2023. For boys, the decline was smaller but still significant, falling from 24 per cent to 16 per cent in the same period.\nDr. Montreuil pointed out, “Eco-anxiety is a reflection of our increasing awareness of climate change and the stress it induces, especially in younger generations who feel they have little control over the situation.”\nFactors behind the numbers\nWhile the pandemic has been blamed for rising mental health challenges, Dr. Montreuil argued it’s not the sole culprit. “Interestingly, the steepest increase in issues occurred before the pandemic,” she explained. “During the pandemic, there was more awareness and discussion about mental health, which might have temporarily slowed the upward trend. Parents were more present, and there was a surge in available resources.”\nDr. Montreuil emphasized that increased awareness and better diagnostic tools also contribute to the rising numbers. “We’re more attuned to what anxiety looks like, which leads to more diagnoses,” she said. “But there’s no denying societal factors, like social media, play a role. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram amplify social comparison, contributing to low self-esteem and even eating disorders.”\nSubscribe to read this story and more\nShare this article",

    "text": "Beca Benito Juárez: ¿de cuánto es el último apoyo para los estudiantes en este 2024?\n[EMILIO BARRIENTOS](/archivo/?q=EMILIO BARRIENTOS&busqueda=autor)\nLos estudiantes de educación básica y media superior inscritos en el programa Beca Benito Juárez recibirán el último apoyo económico del año este mes de diciembre. Este pago representa un alivio económico significativo para las familias, en especial por los retrasos acumulados en meses previos. En total, el monto para este nivel será de 3,680 pesos, cubriendo dos bimestres: septiembre-octubre y noviembre-diciembre.\nApoyo para estudiantes de nivel superior\nEn el caso de los jóvenes inscritos en universidades públicas bajo la modalidad de Beca Jóvenes Escribiendo el Futuro, el monto destinado es notablemente mayor, alcanzando los 11,200 pesos.\nEste apoyo también corresponde al acumulado de los dos últimos bimestres del ciclo. Se trata de un impulso clave para estudiantes en situación de vulnerabilidad, quienes suelen enfrentar mayores desafíos económicos durante sus estudios.\nLos beneficiarios deben estar atentos a las notificaciones oficiales del programa, ya que el pago se realiza de forma directa a las cuentas registradas o a través de operativos especiales en localidades sin acceso bancario.\nEs crucial verificar el estatus de la beca mediante los canales habilitados, como el buscador oficial con la CURP, para garantizar que no existan contratiempos en la recepción.\nCon un alcance nacional, las Becas Benito Juárez buscan garantizar que ningún estudiante abandone sus estudios por falta de recursos económicos. Este programa ha sido fundamental para disminuir la brecha de desigualdad educativa y ofrecer oportunidades a los sectores más vulnerables.\nEste cierre de año pone en evidencia la importancia de estos apoyos, no solo para las familias beneficiadas, sino también como una herramienta para fomentar la continuidad educativa en México.",
