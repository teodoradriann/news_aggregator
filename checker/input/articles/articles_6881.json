    "title": "'Good Times' cast to celebrate 50th anniversary in Delaware in March",
    "text": "Have you ever wondered what the cast from the famous sitcom \"Good Times\" is up to now? You could ask Jimmie Walker (JJ), Bern Nadette Stanis (Velma) and Ralph Carter (Michael) when the iconic TV stars celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show during a special visit at Wilmington Public Library on Friday, March 15. No tickets or registration are required for this free event. Seating is first come, first served. The moderator for the event is actor Ernest Lee Thomas , best known as “Raj” from the ‘70s sitcom “What’s Happening!!” Here's what you need to know about the cast of \"Good Times,\" and more. What is 'Good Times' about? Set against the backdrop of the 1970s in Chicago, \"Good Times\" followed the struggling Evans family, led by James (John Amos) and Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), who were trying to keep their heads above water. The couple lived in the projects with their three children: JJ (Jimmie Walker), Thelma (Bern Nadette Stanis) and Michael (Ralph Carter). Despite the Evans' fight against poverty, the family still managed to keep a smile on their faces, hence the title: \"Good Times.\" The sitcom \"Good Times\" ran from (1974-79) and is considered one of the most iconic Black TV shows for its mix of comedy and ability to tackle social issues. Janet Jackson was on 'Good Times' Years before the King of Pop, Michael Jackson's little sister Janet Jackson became a pop icon, earning her acting stripes as a child star playing the role of Penny on \"Good Times\" (1977-79), per IMDB. Penny was a sweet little girl who was abused by her mom, and the child was eventually saved from her troublesome mother when she was adopted by Willona (Ja'net Dubois), the Evans' upbeat and stylish neighbor. Janet Jackson won't be in attendance at this \"Good Times\" cast event. But it's inevitable her name will be brought up. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer will stop by the Wells Fargo Center in Philly on June 26 as part of her \"Together Again\" summer tour. Who is Jimmie Walker? The brightest star of \"Good Times\" is comedian/actor Jimmie Walker for his portrayal of JJ, a boney artist who often introduced comic relief into the show. He was the eldest of the three Evans children and generated laughs from the audience due to constantly roasting his sister Thelma for her bad cooking skills. JJ's famous catchphrase is \"Dy-no-mite!' Walker has appeared in countless films and TV shows like \"Everybody Hates Chris\" and \"Scrubs,\" plus the comedian still tours. But his role as JJ has overshadowed any other project he's done. Who is Bern Nadette Stanis Fans of \"Good Times\" still marvel at the youthfulness of actress Bern Nadette Stanis (Thelma), who turned 70 years old in December, according to IMDB. Stanis, like her other \"Good Times\" co-stars coming to Delaware, is most recognized from the show for her role as JJ and Michael's attractive sister, who loved to tease her goofy brother JJ. But again, the actress continues to charm fans with her beauty, and her supporters aren't shy about stating as much on social media. Last Halloween on Instagram , she posted a video of herself wearing a catsuit, along with her two daughters. Her supporters nearly lost their minds. \"Thelma stay Fine, geesh!\" one thirsty fan said. \"Why are you still this fine???\" another added. Who is Ralph Carter? Ralph Carter played a key role as the young boy Michael on \"Good Times,\" the baby of the Evans family. Michael was a child activist and smart kid whose character was used to smuggle in Black history and political commentary. Wilmington Public Library (10 E. 10th St., Wilmington) at 6 p.m. Friday, March 15. Admission is free. Visit Facebook.com/WilmingtonLibraryDE , wilmington.lib.de.us or call (302) 571-7400.",

    "text": "News\nGreece’s Commitment to Legalize Same-Sex Marriage Faces Orthodox Church Opposition\n(CTN News) – Despite strong resistance from the powerful Orthodox Church, the centre-right government of Greece said on Thursday that it will carry out its promise to allow same-sex marriage.\nAccording to government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis, the law will be introduced to parliament within the current term of the house, which concludes in 2027.\nThe remark follows a strong rejection of the measure expressed in a 1,500-word opinion delivered late Wednesday by the Church’s governing Holy Synod.\nThe primary point made by the Church was that homosexual couples are treating their children as “companion pets” and “accessories” when it comes to childrearing.\nMarinakis meant that they always respectfully listen to the Church’s viewpoints. “However, we are also carrying out our policy and will consider the opinions of all relevant parties, as well as society, civil society, the general public, and institutions.”\nIn light of Greece’s international rights commitments, the Church maintains that expanding marriage rights would compel the country to grant parental rights in due course.\nAccording to the Church of Greece’s stance, children have an inherent need and, by extension, a right to be raised by a male and a female parent. “This cannot be evaded by any amount of social modernization or political correctness,” the Church bulletin proclaimed.\nA child is not a “companion pet” for someone who wants to feel protective, and neither is it a “accessory” to legitimize or normalize same-sex cohabitation, it noted.\nThe comment became a major story in Greek news outlets.\nAccording to surveys, Greeks are on the fence on same-sex marriage but strongly against gay couples having full parenting rights.\nA U.S. organization established to track prejudice against LGBTQ+ persons, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, reports that 34 nations around the world have legalized\nsame-sex marriage.\nGreece is unique among these nations in that it is home to a predominantly Orthodox Christian population; nonetheless, a few of these nations have recently recognized civil partnerships.\nWhile opposition parties on the left and centre-left typically favour the government’s promise, prominent conservatives in Greece’s ruling coalition have openly voiced both support and criticism.\nAfter winning the party leadership election a few weeks earlier, Stefanos Kasselakis, the country’s left-wing opposition leader, wed his male partner in New York in October.\nIn 2015, Greece passed a law making same-sex civil partnerships lawful.",

    "text": "PARIS, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Omar Harfouch’s \"Concerto for Peace\", which took place on September 18, is being hailed as a resounding success across the music sphere. The historic event brought together classical and oriental music and a call for global harmony. Following its gala performance at the prestigious Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, France, the initiative has garnered international attention as the bearer of a message of peace during difficult times.\nComposer, soloist pianist and award-winning peace champion Omar Harfouch greeted many of the VIP and other guests in the impressive lobby as they arrived. They included diplomats, politicians, media personalities, artists, and peace activists from different religious communities. Notable amongst the celebrities attending was iconic French actress and film producer Catherine Deneuve.\nHarfouch walked onto the stage to welcome a capacity audience of over 1900, before presenting the 60-piece Orchestre Béziers Méditerranée, maestro Mathieu Bonnin, composer and co-orchestrator Houtaf Khoury, and violinist Anne Gravoin.\nStrikingly, all the orchestra donned sunglasses throughout the entire recital. Harfouch, who is widely known for wearing sunglasses as a matter of course, explained as he introduced the first piece, that there was a good reason for this symbolic gesture: he wanted to draw attention to the necessity of light as the antidote to the darkness of hatred, since light and dark cannot coexist. He wanted his audience to bathe in the sunlight of hope.\nThe evening opened with a beautiful and resounding ‘Fantaisie Orientale’ featuring Western and Eastern instruments. Inspired by Harfouch’s infectious zest and sparkle, the audience clapped along. It was so well received that it was immediately reprised, much to everyone’s delight.\nThis was followed by 'Tripoli,' a heartfelt affectionate love letter to his hometown in Lebanon, where, as he described, east meets west. A video accompanied the piece, showcasing the city's diverse architecture and featuring his beloved wife, Yulia, to whom the love letter was undoubtedly also addressed.\nThe penultimate arrangement was ‘You save one life, you save humanity,’ which he premiered last year at the European Commission in Brussels. The title, he explained, was from the Talmud and the Qur’an, expressing how each human life is worth the same, none more than others, none less.\nThe final piece was the much-anticipated concerto. Harfouch told the audience that we wanted them to listen carefully to each movement and hear its message. He joked that some people had phoned him to ask who would be attending, saying, “If X is coming, then I am not!” Clearly, he said gracefully, peace is a concept that has to apply to everyone, even here.\nWhile earlier in the performance Harfouch wore a beaming smile, exuding warmth and joie de vivre, the complex and intricate structure of the concerto, with its interplay of anxiety and anticipation, drew from him an entire spectrum of human emotions. The pain and horror of conflict - something he experienced firsthand in his childhood and which are all too evident today - were often etched on his face. Yet, at other moments, as discordant tones transformed into harmony, there was a palpable sense of relief and resolution, reflecting the concerto's message: peace is the fruit of transformative work.\nThe concerto's conclusion unfolded in a powerful resolution, where the lingering tension of conflict was gradually dissolved into a triumphant, yet fragile, harmony—expressing both the lingering anxiety of past strife and a profound hope for a peaceful future. The final notes resonated with a bittersweet sense of relief, leaving the audience with a reminder that peace, though hard-won, is within reach.\nFollowing a standing ovation, Harfouch stood alone before the audience, raised his arms, and said, “Now it is time for you to respond to the call for peace.” They stood as a 30-strong chorale lined the aisles and sang a thrilling, exquisite harmony on their behalf, serving as a call to action, to commitment to change.\nSpeaking about the importance of the initiative, Harfouch notes, “This event has shown me just how powerful music can be in bringing people together. I hope ‘Concerto for Peace’ keeps inspiring a world united in harmony. We hope to contribute to a global conversation that emphasizes understanding and unity over division.”\nLater this year, the ensemble is slated to expand the concerto’s reach with performances scheduled at the United Nations office in Switzerland, the Vatican, the Italian Parliament, and other key locations across Europe and Asia. Each concert will be tailored to address local issues while reinforcing the profound message of peace and unity. The initiative is expected to attract even more attention in the coming months, as it aligns with broader efforts to bring cultural diplomacy into the mainstream of international relations.\n\"Peace is not an abstract concept; it’s something we must actively pursue,\" Harfouch remarks. \"By using music as our vehicle, we hope to inspire individuals, communities, and leaders to come together in the spirit of cooperation. This is just the beginning of a long journey toward harmony.\"\nFor more information on the \"Concerto for Peace\", visit Omar Harfouch’s official website .\nAbout Concerto for Peace\nThe \"Concerto for Peace\" is a global initiative founded by Omar Harfouch, a celebrated pianist, composer, and humanitarian.
