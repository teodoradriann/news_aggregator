    "text": "▲南韓京畿道烏山市16日暴雨來襲，白色轎車行駛高架橋旁，遭擋土牆崩塌活埋。（圖／達志影像／newscom）\n記者羅翊宬／編譯\n隨著全球氣候極端異常，南韓從昨（16）日起再度迎來「極限暴雨」！光是在忠清南道，短短兩天內的降雨量便高達400mm，而大田、忠清北道、京畿道也淪為豪雨災區，暴雨夾帶雷電狂襲，造成4人死傷，京畿道烏山市一名40多歲男性駕駛轎車行經高架道路旁，豈料卻在9秒內遭到崩塌的擋土牆瞬間活埋，最後慘死車內。\n根據《韓聯社》、《中央日報》，南韓忠清南北道、京畿道從16日起開始降下「極限暴雨」，光是從16日0時至今（17）日上午10時的降雨量，忠清南道瑞山市高達419.5mm、洪城郡411.4mm、唐津市376.5mm、牙山市349.5mm，南韓中央災難安全對策本部針對集中豪雨緊急召開會議，並針對京畿道、忠清南北道發布豪雨警報。\n▼白色轎車行經高架橋旁道路，遭崩塌的擋土牆活埋。\n這場豪雨也為當地帶來慘痛的傷亡災情！一名40多歲男性16日晚間7時4分（台灣時間晚間6時4分），駕駛著白色轎車行經京畿道烏山市佳長洞的高架橋沿線道路，豈料一旁高架橋的擋土牆，因為承受不住暴雨狂襲，而瞬間如骨牌般傾塌，彷彿是水門洩洪，最後白色轎車慘遭土堆活埋。\n在擋土牆崩塌後，設置在高架橋上、長達數十公尺的水泥欄杆也隨之往下傾斜倒塌，最後覆蓋在土堆上，在畫面中完全找不到遭掩埋的白色轎車下落。事後，白色轎車遭活埋的行車紀錄器影像也被媒體公開，從擋土牆坍塌到活埋的時間只有短短9秒鐘，而拍下畫面的轎車駕駛則是緊急剎車，才因此並未受到重傷。\n至於遭擋土牆崩塌活埋的白色轎車40多歲男性駕駛，則是於16日晚間10時緊急送往醫院搶救，不過到院前就已無生命跡象，最後宣告不治。\n▼位於韓國西南部的光州廣域市17日暴雨成災，道路宛如小河。（圖／達志影像／newscom）\n▲南韓首爾17日發布豪雨注意報。（圖／VCG）\n另外，忠清南道瑞山市石南洞，則有一名50多歲男性於17日凌晨3時59分開車行經道路，豈料卻因遇到暴雨來襲，導致車輛遭洪水灌頂淹沒，最後被人發現時已停止呼吸心跳，送往鄰近醫院急救後宣告身亡。\n至於忠清南道青陽郡，則是於17日上午9時34分發生土石流，2名居民遭到活埋，由消防當局搶救當中。\n報導指出，這場暴雨為南韓忠清南北道、京畿道當地帶來慘重災情，伴隨著打雷雨閃電的影響，多地河川氾濫、暴雨成災，至於連接首爾至釜山的幹線鐵道「京釜線」，從首爾車站至大田車站的一般列車也宣告停駛。",

    "text": "LONDON: The Palestinian town of Jericho has named a street after Aaron Bushnell, the US air force member who set himself on fire in an act of protest against Israel’s war in Gaza outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, the Guardian reported on Sunday.\nThe incident took place on Feb. 25, when the 25-year-old, dressed in military attire, shouted “I will no longer be complicit in genocide,” during a live stream on the Internet.\nHe then doused himself in a clear liquid and set himself on fire, screaming “Free Palestine.”\nAt a ceremony to reveal the new street sign on Sunday, Jericho's Mayor Abdul Karim Sidr paid tribute to Bushnell, stating he \"sacrificed everything\" for the Palestinian cause.\n“We didn’t know him, and he didn’t know us. There were no social, economic or political ties between us. What we share is a love for freedom and a desire to stand against these attacks (on Gaza),” the mayor told the crowd.\nThe decision to name the street after Bushnell was made swiftly, just two weeks following his death. “We made a quick decision so we would be first,” Sidr said.\nThe city has also dedicated a square to South Africa in recognition of its government's legal action against Israel at the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide, the Guardian reported.",

    "text": "Reese Witherspoon has opened up about how she no longer speaks to a friend after she roasted her at an awards evening.\nThe 48-year-old revealed how an A-list celebrity actor no longer speaks to her because of the mishap, as she sat down with Will Ferrell to answer hilarious questions on flashcards provided by People as they promoted their new rom-com You're Cordially Invited.\nAdvert\nThe Legally Blonde actor asked the 57-year-old: \"You ever had this moment where you gave a speech and then you're like three years later, 'why did I do that? Why did I do that?'\"\nThe Step Brothers actor said he didn't, to which Witherspoon replied: \"Wow, you just have no regret?\"\nThe Oscar-winning actor continued: \"I have one and it haunts me, it literally haunts me. So this friend of mine who I didn't really know that well but she was a very serious proper actress and she asked me to give her an award, but I had never been to this award ceremony so I thought it was like a roast... so I got up and I roasted her.\"\nFerrell interjects and asks: \"But that was not the tone? Oh boy.\"\nAdvert\n\"The tone was British, elegant, classy... and I was like, 'do you rembember the time we got laser hair removal?', not even kidding! I'm still embarrassed about it,\" she explained, before spilling the tea further.\n\"We're not friends anymore, I'm not even kidding, we're not friends anymore.\n\"I thought it was so funny, and it was just I had the wrong audience. Yeah I'm not even kidding she doesn't talk to me anymore. Oh well.\"\nThe name of Witherspoon's former friend was never really leaked, and a deep search on YouTube of ceremonies where the Louisiana-born mom-of-three spoke at didn't uncover any answers.\nAdvert\nHowever, last year she did honor Nicole Kidman, after she won the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. That same night, she impersonated Kidman's Australian accent, although her speech was moving.\n\"She is every bit as talented and gorgeous and sophisticated and elegant as you can possibly imagine.\n\"When you're sitting opposite her watching her work, it is literally mesmerizing. I would have to stop myself sometimes and go, 'oh my God, that's Nicole Kidman! Oh my God. Be profesh. Be profesh' - because I was that blown away.\nAdvert\nShe went on to describe her as 'one of the most brilliant business women I've ever met', and that 'she's very, very much taller than me as well'.\nSo, can we rule out Kidman?\nTopics: Celebrity, Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Hollywood, Oscars",

    "text": "El Kremlin dijo el jueves que los cambios en la doctrina rusa sobre armamento nuclear esbozados por el presidente Vladimir Putin deben considerarse una señal a los países occidentales de que habrá consecuencias si participan en ataques contra Rusia. Putin dijo el miércoles que Rusia podría usar armas nucleares si era atacada con misiles convencionales, y que Moscú consideraría cualquier ataque en su contra apoyado por una potencia nuclear como uno conjunto. La decisión de cambiar la doctrina nuclear oficial de Rusia es la respuesta del Kremlin a las deliberaciones en Estados Unidos y Reino Unido sobre si dar o no permiso a Ucrania para disparar misiles convencionales occidentales contra Rusia. Este contenido se hizo gracias al apoyo de la comunidad de El Destape. Sumate. Sigamos haciendo historia. El portavoz del Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov, dijo que se habían formulado ajustes a un documento titulado \"Los fundamentos de la política estatal en el ámbito de la disuasión nuclear\". Preguntado por los periodistas si los cambios eran una señal a Occidente, Peskov dijo: \"Esto debe considerarse una señal definitiva\". \"Es una señal que advierte a estos países de las consecuencias si participan en un ataque contra nuestro país por diversos medios, y no necesariamente nucleares\", dijo Peskov. La actual doctrina nuclear publicada de Rusia, establecida en un decreto de Putin de 2020, dice que Rusia puede usar armas nucleares en caso de un ataque nuclear por parte de un enemigo o un ataque convencional que amenace la existencia del Estado.

    "text": "Good\nnews for fans of the Quebec star! One of Celine Dion’s villas, located in Quebec, Canada, is now available for rent on Airbnb since the end of December. At the time, the singer had it built, in 2002, for her mother, Thérèse Tanguay. With a “amazing water view”the villa composed of eight bedrooms and of four bathrooms is able to accommodate up to 17 people. And for people traveling with their pets, the platform reports that it is possible to accommodate them as well.\nEquipped with a large double garage, fully equipped for washing cars, the residence 560 square meters, fully furnished, also includes three independent fireplaces. The house has been available to interested Canadians and tourists since December 23. “We were booked almost each day from the beginning”underlines François Duplantie, a real estate developer from Laval, for\nthe Journal de Montréal.\nREAD ALSO Johnny Hallyday and Nathalie Baye: their old house has been abandoned since the sale\n800 euros per night\nThe residence was purchased in 2023 by François Duplantie, three years after the death of “Maman Dion”, at the price of $2.1 million. “The minimum price is $1,100 per night (800 euros) for 17 people, but we have a discount right now for the first three Airbnb rentals”specifies the real estate developer.\nThe villa is located next to one of the largest parks in the Quebec region. And with a little luck, snow lovers will even be able to snowshoe, cross-country ski, and slide. According to the announcement, it is even possible to skate or fish on the ice right in front of the house. The owners also promise a “thermal experience” from spring 2024 with spa, sauna, cold bath, outdoor fire, meditation dock, yoga, etc.\nRead more: Already 16 episodes of FC De Kampioenen are no longer broadcast due to inappropriate humor | show\nReceive our latest\nnews Every week, your appointment with real estate news.\n2024-01-05 22:00:15\n#house #belonged #Céline #Dion #rented #Airbnb",

    "text": "Norsk Renewables AS: Private placement of NOK 36.27 million successfully completed\n15 Feb 2024 23:39 CET\nCompany Name\nNORSK RENEWABLES AS\nISIN\nNO0010941925\nMarket\nSymbol\nNSOL\nNorsk Renewables AS: Private placement of NOK 36.27 million successfully\ncompleted.\nNOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR\nINDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO AUSTRALIA, CANADA, HONG KONG, JAPAN OR THE UNITED STATES\nOR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION\nWOULD BE UNLAWFUL. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE\nSECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.\nOslo, 15 February 2024: Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement\npublished by Norsk Renewables AS (\"Norsk Renewables\" or the \"Company\") on 13\nFebruary 2024 regarding a contemplated share issue in the Company (the \"Private\nPlacement\"), in which Pareto Securities AS has acted as sole global coordinator\nand bookrunner (the \"Manager\").\nThe Company hereby announces that it has allocated 120,895,299 new shares (the\n\"Offer Shares\") in the Private Placement at a subscription price of NOK 0.30 per\nOffer Share (the \"Offer Price\"), raising gross proceeds of approx. NOK 36.27\nmillion. The Company had received a pre-commitment from its largest shareholder,\nValinor AS (\"Valinor\"), which had committed to subscribe for NOK 30 million and\nwas therefore allocated 100 million Offer Shares.\nThe net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement will be used to cover\ndevelopment expenses to further develop the Company's significant project\npipeline in South Africa to the ready-to-build stage as well as for general\noperating expenses through 2024.\nThe Offer Shares will be issued by, and are subject to, a resolution by the\nCompany’s extraordinary general meeting to be held on or about 2 April 2024 (the\n\"EGM\"). The Company expects to send the notice for the EGM during the course of\nweek 8 2024.\nSettlement of the Offer Shares is expected to take place on or about 5 April\n2024. The allocated shares will be delivered to the applicant’s account in the\nNorwegian Central Securities Depository (\"VPS\") on a delivery versus payment\n(“DvP”) basis as soon as practicable after the Conditions (as defined below)\nhave been met. DvP settlement of the Offer Shares is facilitated through a\npre-funding agreement entered into between the Company and the Manager (the\n\"Pre-Payment Agreement\").\nThe completion of the Private Placement is subject to: (i) the EGM resolving to\napprove the Private Placement and issue the Offer Shares, (ii) the Pre-Payment\nAgreement remaining in full force and effect, (iii) the share capital increase\npertaining to the issuance of the Offer Shares being validly registered with the\nNorwegian Register of Business Enterprises, and (iv) the allocated Offer Shares\nbeing validly issued and registered in the VPS (together, the \"Conditions\").\nFollowing registration of the new share capital pertaining to the issuance of\nthe Offer Shares, the Company will have a share capital of NOK 1,967,205.61\ndivided into 196,720,561 shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.01.\n*Subsequent Offering*\nThe Board has, subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other\nconditions, resolved to propose to carry out a subsequent offering of up to\n23,200,000 new shares at the Offer Price (the \"Subsequent Offering\") which, if\napplicable and subject to applicable securities law, will be directed towards\nexisting eligible shareholders in the Company as of 15 February 2024 (as\nregistered with the VPS two trading days thereafter, the \"Record Date\") who (i)\ndo not have a pro-rata share of the Private Placement which is equal to or\nhigher than the minimum order and allocation in the Private Placement (3.1325%\nof the shares outstanding in the Company), (ii) were not allocated Offer Shares\nin the Private Placement, and (iii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where\nsuch offering would be unlawful or would (other than Norway) require any\nprospectus, filing, registration or similar action (the \"Eligible\nShareholders\"). The Eligible Shareholders will receive non-transferable\nsubscription rights in the Subsequent Offering. Over-subscription will be\npermitted for Eligible Shareholders. Subscription without subscription rights\nwill not be permitted in the Subsequent Offering.\nCompletion of the Subsequent Offering will be subject to (i) completion of the\nPrivate Placement, (ii) relevant corporate resolutions, including a resolution\nby the EGM to authorise the Board to issue the new shares in the Subsequent\nOffering, and (iii) the prevailing market price of the Company's shares,\nincluding the trading price of the Company's shares exceeding the Offer Price.\nThe subscription period for the Subsequent Offering (if applicable) will\ncommence as soon as possible following the Board's decision to carry out the\nSubsequent Offering. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to\ncancel the Subsequent Offering.\nThe net proceeds from any Subsequent Offering will be applied for general\ncorporate purposes. A separate stock exchange notice will be made relating to\nthe key information for the Subsequent Offering.\n*Equal treatment considerations*\nThe Private Placement represents a deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive\nright to subscribe for and be allocated the Offer Shares. The Private Placement\nhas therefore been considered by the Board in light of the equal treatment\nobligations under section 3.1 of the Euronext Growth Rule Book Part II and Oslo\nBørs' Circular no. 2/2014, and the Board is of the opinion that it is in\ncompliance with these requirements and guidelines. The issuance of the Offer\nShares was carried out as a private placement and, combined with focusing the\ngeographical footprint of the Company, other available funding sources\n(including potential sale of operating assets) and other strategic options, is\nexpected to cover development expenses to further develop the Company’s\nsignificant project pipeline in South Africa to ready-to-build stage and general\noperating expenses through 2024. Following the maturation of the said portfolio\nin South Africa up to ready-to-build stage, further capital will be needed to\nconstruct and complete the projects under the Company’s current strategy. By\nstructuring the equity raise as a private placement, the Company is able to\nefficiently raise the necessary capital for the abovementioned purposes.\nIn addition, the Company had received a pre-commitment from its largest existing\nshareholder to reduce transaction risk. In order to limit the dilutive effect of\nthe Private Placement and to facilitate equal treatment, the Board has proposed\nthe Subsequent Offering, subject to the conditions set out above. Finally, the\nPrivate Placement and ancillary corporate resolutions are subject to approval by\nthe EGM, at which the Company's shareholders will be given an opportunity to\nexpress their opinion and vote over the related share capital increase. On the\nbasis of the above, and an assessment of the current equity markets as advised\nby the Manager, the Company's need for funding, deal execution risk and\navailable alternatives, the Board is of the opinion that the waiver of the\npreferential rights inherent in the Private Placement is in the common interest\nof the Company and its shareholders.\n*Legal advisor*\nAdvokatfirmaet Thommessen AS acts as legal counsel to the Company in connection\nwith the Private Placement and potential Subsequent Offering.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIngrid Sara Grimstad Amundsgård\nEVP Sustainability, HSE, Communications & Investor Relations\ningrid.sara@norskrenewables.com\n+ 47 90135533\nThis information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU\nMarket Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant\nto the STA section 5-12.\nThis stock exchange announcement was published by Ingrid Sara Grimstad\nAmundsgård, media contact at Norsk Renewables AS, on 15 of February 2024 at\n23:32 CET.\n***\nAbout the company: Norsk Renewables is a vertically integrated independent power\nproducer with approximately 100 MW of solar power in operation or under\nconstruction, combined with a 1 GW secured portfolio under development.\nExpanding commercial offerings with wind and storage projects is in line with\nthe company`s strategy to replace consumers' energy consumption with 100%\nrenewable power.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nThe information contained in this announcement is for background purposes only\nand does not purport to be full or complete.
