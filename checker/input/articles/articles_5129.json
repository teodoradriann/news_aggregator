    "text": "Trump uses 'racist slur' against senator as he furiously 'live truths' while watching DNC The Democratic National Convention comes to a dramatic end on Thursday night with Kamala Harris' speech - and Donald Trump is watching. [Donald Trump](/latest/donald-trump) is watching the final night of the Democratic National Convention - and his 'live Truthing' has already caused a scandal. Trump has missed many powerful moments at the DNC this week, with [Tim Walz's 17-year-old son breaking down in tears](/news/politics/146600/tim-walz-s-17-year-old-son-breaks-down-tears-father-s-dnc-speech) and [Michelle Obama slamming Trump like a naughty schoolbo](/news/politics/146564/michelle-obama-donald-trump-chicago-dnc-democrats-kamala-harris)y as the [Democrats move to the right on key policies.](/news/politics/146637/democrat-policy-immigration-policing) But he's definitely watching on Thursday night as headline act [Kamala Harris](/latest/kamala-harris) takes to the stage.

Elizabeth Warren. He wrote: \"Pocahontas is now speaking at the DNC. She used her fake Indian heritage to scam the system. Her mother told her she had “high cheekbones,” and therefore she was Indian, who would use this hoax on applications everywhere. It worked until she got caught. 10024th Indian, remember?\" Trump has a long-standing feud with Warren, and it's not the first time he's used the 'Pocahontas' nickname. The 78-year-old has taken delight in taunting Warren over claims about her Native American heritage - with many claiming the nickname is a 'racial slur'. As a teacher during the 80s and 90s, Warren formally notified administrators at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard law schools that she had partial Native American heritage and was listed as a Native American faculty member. But she's faced allegations of using her ancestry to advance her career, something Trump has been keen to remind her of. Trump previously said he would give a million dollars to charity if Warren will take a test proving her heritage. DON'T MISS: In 2018, Warren did take a DNA test which showed \"strong evidence\" of some Native American ancestry. \"While the vast majority of the individual’s ancestry is European, the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor in the individual’s pedigree, likely in the range of 6-10 generations ago,\" the report read. This morning, Trump was humiliated after [giving a live interview on Fox News as he falsely claimed Kamala Harris had previously met with Vladimir Putin](/news/politics/146665/donald-trump-humiliated-fox-news-kamala-harris-putin-claim). Moments after Trump hung up the phone following an interview with Fox & Friends, co-host Brian Kilmeade [moved quickly to set the record straight about Harris](/news/politics/146459/Michelle-Obama-dnc-chicago-kamala-harris-democrats-barack-trump-Donald).

    "text": "By Scout Springgate ,\n1 hour ago\nWhile at the podium for day three of the ACC Football Kickoff event in Charlotte, North Carolina, North Carolina Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown gave a fierce take on how he views the current state of college football.\nBrown has seen the college football landscape drastically change throughout his time as a head coach. He said on the podium that there have been more shifts in the 2020s than any other period of his 40-plus year coaching career.\n“There’s been more changes in my last three years than my first 47,” said Brown on the ACC Network. “Somebody said today, ‘Why don’t you write a book about your first day at Appalachia [Appalachian State] and now the way things have changed?’ I said, ‘Some people have to die first’ – we couldn’t say all the things.”\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown. Ken Ruinard-USA TODAY Sports\nWhen asked about his views on the new NIL and free-moving transfer portal element in the sport, Brown explained those who can quickly adapt to the changes will be the most successful.\n“We’re dealing with things we’ve never dealt with before,” Brown said. “The people that can adjust and make it work are going to be the ones that have the best programs.\"\nBrown continued by stating that the amateurism of the sport is long gone and referred to college football as a miniature version of the NFL.\n“It’s not ideal for any of us,\" he said. \"None of us voted for it, but it’s here. Amateurism is gone. We’re the mini-NFL. So now we’ve got to figure out how to handle it.\"\nIt's often difficult to alter one's self for someone as deep into their career as Brown but he knows that he has little choice to what other programs are achieving by embracing the changes to the sport.\n“Instead of griping about it, they’re going to win most games,” said Brown. “That’s just what you do as the structure of college football changes and moves forward.”\nBrown enters the sixth year of his second stint as Tar Heels' head coach when North Carolina opens its 2024 campaign on Aug. 29 from Minneapolis' Huntington Bank Stadium against the Minnesota Golden Gophers at 8:00 pm (ET) on Fox.\nRelated: Dabo Swinney Makes His Perception On Transfer Portal Crystal Clear\nRelated: College Football Fans Have Unanimous Reaction To Banner At ACC Football Kickoff\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "FORT SHAFTER, Hawaii- The Women’s Air Raid Defense (WARD) stands as a testament to the resilience and dedication of women during World War II. Formed in response to the Pearl Harbor attack, WARD was a civilian organization comprised of women who played a crucial role in air defense.\nVolunteers for WARD, primarily military spouses, underwent rigorous training. Criteria for recruitment included an age range of 20 to 34, no children, and the successful passage of an Army intelligence test. These women became skilled in plotting airplane positions using experimental radar technology, showcasing their adaptability and commitment during a time of innovation.\nAfter completing their training, WARD recruits worked tirelessly, staffing the air defense center 24/7 from a tunnel known as “Lizard” or building 1492 at Fort Shafter.\nThese women faced the challenges of wartime uncertainty. As they monitored updates about their husbands through communication channels, they formed bonds and a sisterhood that became essential in navigating the stresses of the era.\nUnderstanding the historical contributions of these women is crucial in recognizing the contemporary importance of military spouses.\nWARD, active until the end of World War II in 1945, witnessed some members transitioning to civil service roles in Hawaii. Despite the unfortunate loss of official records in a 1973 fire, the legacy of WARD endures through works like \"Shuffleboard Pilots,\" a book by Kam Napier and Candace Chenowith that documents the history of the organization based on personal experiences of the women who served as WARDs.\nThe story of WARD is one of adaptability, sacrifice, and resilience. These women, through their pioneering work in radar technology and their unwavering dedication, played a pivotal role in the defense of our nation during a consequential time in history.\n|Date Taken:||03.08.2024|\n|Date Posted:||03.08.2024 14:49|\n|Story ID:||465755|\n|Location:||FORT SHAFTER, HI, US|\n|Web Views:||7|\n|Downloads:||0|\nThis work, The Radar Women of World War II, by\n[SGT Perla Alfaro](/portfolio/1776210/perla-alfaro), identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.",

    "text": "Après le déluge, le calme. La vigilance orange a été levée samedi 21 juin dans la soirée en Savoie et en Isère. Après les pluies torrentielles qui se sont abattues sur les massifs de l'Oisans et des Ecrins le village de Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans, qui fait partie du domaine skiable des 2 Alpes, restait \"totalement enclavé\" en début de soirée, tandis que le village de Venosc, à l'orée du parc national des Ecrins était \"relié uniquement par une télécabine vers les Deux Alpes\", a fait savoir la préfecture de l'Isère. \"De nombreux dégâts matériels sont constatés sur les habitations et les axes routiers\" et un diagnostic de l'état des routes sera lancé samedi, pour plusieurs jours.La route départementale desservant \"Saint-Christophe-en-Oisans est fortement impactée à de nombreux endroits\", \"certaines zones ne sont pas encore diagnostiquées car elles sont inaccessibles ou sous l'eau\", a précisé de son côté le département de l'Isère.Au total, \"une centaine de personnes\" ont été évacuées \"en un temps record\" au moyen de quatre hélicoptères du hameau de la Bérarde, s'est félicité le préfet Louis Laugier, dans une vidéo publiée par Le Dauphiné libéré. La décrue en cours en MayenneEn déplacement vendredi en Mayenne, le ministre de la Transition écologique, Christophe Béchu, a promis la reconnaissance de l'état de catastrophe naturelle pour les communes touchées la veille par la crue historique de l'Oudon. La procédure de reconnaissance de catastrophe naturelle devrait être engagée \"dès la mi-juillet\", et permettra \"d'accompagner les sinistrés\", a-t- expliqué. Le bassin de l'Oudon a vécu \"une crue absolument exceptionnelle\", puisque \"en l'espace de quatre heures, il est tombé l'équivalent de 135 litres d'eau par m2, c'est-à-dire l'équivalent de ce qui tombe normalement plutôt en l'espace de quatre mois\", a souligné le ministre.La vigilance rouge pour crues a été levée vendredi pour les départements de la Mayenne et de Maine-et-Loire, repassés en jaune dans l'après-midi. \"Depuis huit mois (...) nous avons dépassé la 100e alerte de vigilance orange ou rouge aux crues. Sur les 20 dernières années, on n'avait jamais dépassé 40 pour vous donner un ordre de grandeur de ce qu'on est en train de vivre\", a déclaré Christophe Béchu, appelant les Français à \"vraiment tenir compte des prévisons\".",

The Valley star had a confident comeback for online trolls after facing shameful remarks about her body. \"Babe those b*obs are too big,\" an Instagram critic commented on Brittany's April 17 post. \"They make you heavier than you even are.\" The Vanderpump Rules alum didn’t hold back, and had just the right reply for the hater. \"Could you imagine me going on your page and commenting on your body?\" the 35-year-old replied. \"Yes my boobs are big, cool.\" The Bravolebrity showed off her latest fashion moment, showcasing her curve-hugging strapless corset dress and beautiful makeup look in the post. Brittany hasn’t shied away from being open about her plastic surgery journey, and even shared her breast augmentation on the fourth season of Vanderpump Rules. Jax Taylor, her then-boyfriend and now estranged husband, was the one who convinced her for the b*objob. \"It's not just for you, it's for me,\" he said in the February 2016 episode. \"Who doesn't love big b*obs?\" Other than this, the star has had liposuction and Morpheus8 treatment, which is a procedure to boost collagen production.

    "text": "Mr Bates Vs The Post Office stars Toby Jones, Monica Dolan and Katherine KellyREAD MORE: Meet Paula Vennells: As chief executive officer of the Post Office, she presided over an organisation that covered up the prosecutions of hundreds of innocent postmasters for fraud\nPossibly the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history happened in one of Britain’s most trusted institutions.\nBetween 2000 and 2015, the Post Office falsely accused 3,500 subpostmasters of theft, fraud and false accounting. Over 700 were prosecuted. Some went to prison. Many lost their homes and life savings paying back money the Post Office claimed was missing.\nA Daily Mail investigation found the scandal was linked to four suicides, and it’s claimed that 60 victims died before they found any justice at all.\nYet they’d done nothing wrong – the fault lay with the Post Office’s own malfunctioning Horizon computer system which wrongly reported financial discrepancies.\nNow a major new ITV drama, Mr Bates Vs The Post Office, starring Toby Jones, Monica Dolan and Katherine Kelly, lays bare the full horror of this story and champions the stoic subpostmasters who stood up for themselves and fought to expose the shocking actions of Post Office bosses, who continued to pursue them despite warnings that Horizon was to blame.\nMr Bates Vs The Post Office tells the true story of how the Post Office falsely accused 3,500 subpostmasters of theft, fraud and false accounting between 2000 and 2015\nFollowing a landmark Court of Appeal decision to overturn their convictions, dozens of former subpostmasters have been exonerated on all counts after 20 years of fighting. An independent public statutory inquiry into the matter is ongoing, expected to end in early 2024.\n‘In three years working on this project, I’ve never got over that initial shock of disbelief,’ says writer Gwyneth Hughes, who was also behind real-life dramas Honour and Three Families.\n‘To this day, every victimised subpostmaster I meet, every appalling story I hear, makes me squeal with astonishment and rage.’\nToby Jones plays Alan Bates, the subpostmaster who organised the fightback, setting up the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) in 2009.\nHe ran the Post Office in Craig-y-Don, a suburb of Llandudno in Wales, for five years until he was fired for refusing to comply with Post Office policy.\nHis scenes were filmed in the shop that the real Alan worked in, alongside his partner Suzanne Sercombe (Julie Hesmondhalgh).\nToby, 57, hopes that the drama will amplify this shocking national scandal – one he admits that he didn’t know much about before taking the role. ‘To my shame, I hadn’t understood the full severity of the story,’ he says.\nThe Detectorists and Indiana Jones star adds, ‘I assume it’s because when you hear ‘Post Office’ you take for granted what it does. It’s shocking how appalling this scandal is.\n‘If we’ve done our job, when people watch it will make them see a senselessness and vindictiveness that makes you wonder how on Earth it isn’t being spoken about more.’\nW1A actress Monica Dolan has a pivotal role as real-life Hampshire subpostmaster Jo Hamilton, driven to despair by discrepancies in her accounts. ‘She kept thinking it was her fault,’ explains Monica, 54.\n‘She remortgaged her house and got into huge debt. She was so ashamed. She kept ringing the helpline but they kept saying, as they did to all the other subpostmasters, ‘It’s only you that this is happening to.’\nGwyneth attempts to tell the Post Office’s side of the story too, asking who knew the Horizon software was faulty and when.\nToby Jones stars as Alan Bates, the subpostmaster who organised the fightback, setting up the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) in 2009, while Julie Hesmondhalgh plays his partner Suzanne\nFew employees were willing to talk, so she had to create scenes featuring CEO Paula Vennells (The Crown’s Lia Williams) from emails and a transcript from a 2015 Select Committee hearing.\nLia, 59, says, ‘It was one of the hardest things I’ve had to do as an actor. Paula’s dialogue is literally transcripts that I had to try to make fit in my mouth and sound natural.\n‘It was very important I didn’t present her as some evil monster when I don’t know what was going on behind closed doors. We only know she lost control of a situation she had no idea how to manage.’\nEx-Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was on the Select Committee in 2015, and he plays himself. ‘There was an issue of whether we should use the real footage, but the real Alan Bates was behind Nadhim,’ says director James Strong.\n‘So we thought, ‘Shall we ask Nadhim if he’ll do it?’ And he said yes. He did exactly what he did on the day, which is one of the only times the Post Office has been taken to task in a public setting. To see him give them both barrels was great.’\nToby considers it a privilege to play Alan Bates. ‘It’s a very uplifting story, it shows that people can unite and take action. I’m honoured to have anything to do with Alan Bates. He’s an extraordinary man.’\nMr Bates Vs The Post Office, New Year’s Day, 9pm, ITV1.",

On Thursday, while in Vidarbha, ... Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray's state tour has been marred by controversies. On Thursday, while in Vidarbha, a meeting of MNS saw a major conflict among party workers regarding candidate nominations, leading to a physical altercation between factions. Thackeray will be touring Vidarbha until August 26. On Thursday, he held a meeting with party officials and workers in Chandrapur. After the meeting, as he was leaving for his next destination, a clash broke out between two MNS factions within the hall. Disagreements over the candidacy of party official Sachin Bhoyer led to a major dispute and a physical brawl between Bhoyer’s and Chandra Prakash Borkar’s supporters. MNS leader Raju Umbarkar announced that Prakash Borkar, who had attempted to damage the party’s reputation, has been expelled. Thackeray stated that strict action will be taken against those causing internal disputes. District Secretary Chandra Prakash Borkar criticized Thackeray for not giving the assembly ticket to Chandrapur resident Chandrakant Bhoyer, calling it a significant mistake and warning of potential rebellion if the error is not corrected. Thackeray assured that party candidates will be prioritized for assembly tickets. Earlier, during his tour of Marathwada, Thackeray faced protests from Maratha activists who targeted the hotel where he was staying in Dharashiv. His visit to Beed also saw protests, with workers blocking his convoy and throwing betel nuts in front of his car, drawing significant attention to his tour.

Friday, 02 Aug 2024 11:28 AM MYT TOKYO, Aug 2 — Japan sweltered through its hottest July since records began 126 years ago, the weather agency said, as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe.\nTemperatures in the country were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average, breaking last year’s record for July of 1.91 degrees Celsius above average.\n“It was the highest since statistics began in 1898,” the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said yesterday, noting that the figures were “considerably higher” nationwide.\nOf 153 observation posts across Japan, 62 broke their average temperature record in July.\nContributing factors included a high-pressure system over the Pacific and “warm air from the south” that shrouded northern parts of the archipelago, the JMA said.\nSince April, heatstroke has killed 59 people in Japan, according to the disaster management agency.\nParasols and chunky necklaces that can be stored in the freezer have been a common sight around Tokyo, where street performer Jiro Kan, 56, told AFP he was feeling the heat.\n“After spending two hours standing here, I get so sweaty I can literally squeeze it all out from my shirt. I’m drenched,” said Kan, dressed in an all-yellow suit.\n“People who are used to a more dry type of heat like in the United States find the heat and humidity in Japan more difficult to handle,” he said in tourist hotspot Asakusa.\nLast month, Shizuoka west of Tokyo became the first Japanese region to see the mercury reach 40 degrees Celsius this year — far surpassing the 35-degree threshold deemed “extremely hot” by authorities.\nHeatwaves are becoming increasingly common across the globe, with the European Union’s climate monitor saying in July that the Earth experienced its warmest day in recorded history. — AFP\n You May Also Like Related Articles\nWorld / 1 m ago Blinken cites ‘overwhelming evidence’ for Gonzalez Urrutia’s win, as US urges Venezuela to release voting data\nWorld / 13 m ago Manila Chinatown inferno claims 11 lives\nWorld / 1 h ago Kamala Harris set for Democratic nomination as Trump faces backlash over ‘birtherism’ remarks Just IN\n5 m ago Palestine liberation rally at Bukit Jalil this Sunday with PM Anwar, come and show your support, says Fahmi\n18 m ago After formal Brics bid, PM Anwar says will meet Putin in Russia soon\n23 m ago Nenggiri by-election: Candidate nominations open tomorrow",
