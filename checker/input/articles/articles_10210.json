    "title": "Kamala Is Running From Policy Proposals As Much As From the Media – PJ Media",
    "text": "This week, we learned that Kamala Harris intends to unveil her first major policy proposal. However, she didn't plagiarize this one from Donald Trump; she plagiarized it from Soviet Russia. According to the campaign, her new policy proposal is “the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries,” which is just a euphemistic way of saying “ price controls .” Anyone who knows history knows that such policies don’t work and backfire spectacularly. But Kamala is continuing the Biden tradition of trying to claim that Bidenomics doesn't cause inflation but that greedy corporations do and that the only way to fix the problem is for the government to step in. The critics of this proposal have come out in full force, and the policy could come under fire from friendly sources once details come out. As recently as a few months ago, CNN poured cold water on the idea that corporate greed is the leading cause of inflation. \"Some progressives have frequently blamed corporate greed for fueling the high cost of living that Americans are fed up with,\" the report said. \"Yet new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco casts doubt on the greedflation theory.\" Related: Kamala Officially Chickens Out of First Debate With Trump CNN may not be so honest about it now, but it's hardly surprising that Kamala's campaign advisers are worried about revealing the specifics of her economic plan, fearing it could backfire, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. \"As they flesh out Harris’s agenda, her economic advisers have debated how detailed they should be, some of the people familiar with the discussions said, amid concerns from some Democrats that releasing a lengthy plan could open the vice president up to criticism from Republicans and members of her party,\" the paper reported. \"The policy framework is expected to outline broad policy areas she supports, while avoiding many of the thorny details.\" \"Harris’s ascension to the top of the ticket has energized Democrats and some allies have cautioned against doing anything that could slow that momentum, including lengthy interviews with media outlets,\" the article pointed out. Because we have to elect her to find out what's in her policy proposals. Meanwhile, you can go on the Trump campaign website and get all the details you need about Trump's positions and policy proposals. Related: Kamala Just Blew Up Her Excuse For Not Doing Interviews Perhaps the biggest problem Harris will face, regardless of what her proposals are and how detailed they are, is the question of why she hasn't done anything about the problems that she says she wants to fix. As the sitting vice president, she can't help but be linked to and have to run on the agenda and record of the current administration — which would be difficult for even a competent politician to do. 🚨SINCE HARRIS TOOK OFFICE— Jacki Kotkiewicz (@jackikotkiewicz) Gas: +50.5% Electricity: +31.7% Fuel oil: +49.1% Airfare: +22.6% Hotels: +51.2% Groceries: +21.6% Eating out: +23% Baby food: +30.1% K-12 food: +65.5% Rent: +22% Transportation: +32.9% Car insurance: +54% Real average weekly earnings: -3.9% [August 14, 2024] According to Axios , \"Harris doesn't want to be completely defined by the Biden-Harris record,\" but that will be nearly impossible without a detailed agenda or policy proposals. The problem is that the devil is always in the details.",

    "title": "Illinois plays bad - like really bad - in overtime loss at Nebraska",
    "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. — Another bad loss in Big Ten play.\nNebraska entered Thursday’s game as the losers of six straight Big Ten games, including two blowout losses. The Illini have struggled recently too, but were coming off a mostly dominant win over Northwestern just four days ago.\nYet, Nebraska outlasted Illinois in overtime in Lincoln, winning 80-74, without either team playing particularly well. Illinois closed the gap late with some timely shooting from Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn and Will Riley, but couldn't pull it out in the end.\nIllinois beat themselves in this one. The lack of a functioning offense, attributed to bad shooting and lazy turnovers caused their downfall, even though they managed to force overtime.\n“We’re the youngest team in Power Four,” Brad Underwood said postgame. “We’ve had two games without Kasparas, we’re three now without Tomi...It’s nice when we have our pieces and would like to continue to grow. It is frustrating for me, because I know where we could be and where we’re getting to. Tonight’s frustrating for me because of the mental lapses we had that we haven't been making. I don't know when we get whole again.”\nIt was another poor shooting night for Illinois (14-7, 6-5 Big Ten), who went 10-for-42 from downtown, including 0-for-8 in overtime. Freshman Will Riley did his best to keep Illinois alive in the second half, finishing with 16 points on the night.\nFor the ninth time in 11 conference games, Illinois shot under 33% from distance. Nebraska (13-8, 3-7 Big Ten) is one of the worst teams in the conference at defending the three-pointer, yet Illinois was unable to capitalize.\nIllinois managed to stick around in the first half despite shooting just 3-for-18 from beyond the arc and not recording a single assist. They went without a field goal for nearly six minutes, but didn't trail by more than five points during that scoring drought.\nNebraska eventually capitalized on Illinois’ poor shooting, costly turnovers, and foul trouble, going on a 16-6 run late in the half. The Cornhuskers caught the Illini sleeping several times, scoring in transition easily and getting wide-open dunks due to defensive miscommunications. They took a 40-31 lead into the break.\nIllinois shot better in the second half, led by Riley’s three triples, but played incredibly sloppy basketball otherwise. Nebraska’s veteran roster took advantage of lazy turnovers and uncharacteristic mistakes from Brad Underwood’s squad.\n“Tonight was very uncharacteristic of us from a scouting report standpoint making those turnovers,” Underwood said. “Not gonna beat anybody doing that.”\nSophomore center Tomislav Ivisic (mononucleosis) missed his third consecutive game. Illinois clearly missed his presence, as they were outscored 44-28 in the paint. The Illini didn't have much offensive success down low and struggled to initiate much offense in general.\n“Without Tomi...we’re not the greatest post-up team in the world,” said Underwood. “We’ve gotta be able to crease the defense with our guards and we have been. We’re one of the top teams in the country with two-point rate. Tonight, we didn't do it very well and that's a tribute to their defense.”\nIllinois had won nine straight games against Nebraska, with three of those wins coming in Lincoln.\nSTAT STUFFERS\n- Kasparas Jakucionis (ILL) — 18 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists\n- Will Riley (ILL) — 18 points, 4-for-10 3pt\n- Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn (ILL) — 15 points, 4 rebounds\n- Brice Williams (NU) — 27 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists\n- Connor Essegian (NU) — 14 points, 4 rebounds\nYOU GOTTA SEE THIS\nClutch shooting from the sophomore.\nGibbs-Lawhorn ties it up in Lincoln ‼️\n— Big Ten Men's Basketball (@B1GMBBall)[@IlliniMBB][#B1GMBBall]on FS1[pic.twitter.com/UESumBTi8i][January 31, 2025]\nUP NEXT\nIllinois returns home to Champaign for a game against Ohio State on Sunday. The game is at noon and can be watched on CBS.",
