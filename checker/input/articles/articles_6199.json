    "text": "Israeli forces have attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said.\nThree Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly one per cent of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on October 7, killing 1200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a November 24-December 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nUS President Joe Biden on Thursday said Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on October 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on December 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEgypt on Thursday confirmed it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\nwith DPA\n ",

    "text": "SAN JACINTO COUNTY, Texas — A murder case that had gone cold was recently solved by investigators in San Jacinto County when 67-year-old Robert Dale Clary, of Shepherd, pleaded guilty to murder. Clary killed Rhonda Darline Richardson, also of Shepherd, in May 2019, but the case wasn't solved until years after her death. Her death Richardson was found dead in a wooded area near her home. San Jacinto County Sheriff's Office deputies were the ones who discovered the gruesome crime scene. Early in the investigation, Clary was identified as the primary suspect, but authorities didn't have enough evidence to formally charge him. Case goes cold Investigators weren't able to charge Clary by the end of 2020, but in 2022, a team of independent investigators with Cold Justice were brought in to review the case files and conduct new interviews. New digital evidence was discovered from both Richardson and Clary's phones that investigators said definitively linked Clary to the murder. Clary's trial was slated to begin on April 29, 2024, but he pleaded guilty before it began. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Who was Richardson? Richardson spent years as a corrections officer for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and worked at several different prisons. Most recently, Richardson worked at the Polunsky Unit, a prison near Livingston that houses Texas' death row inmates. \"Let this case be a reminder to all who prey on the residents of San Jacinto County,\" District Attorney Todd Dillon said. \"Even if it takes years, what is done in the dark will be brought to the light. Rhonda was beloved by family, friends and coworkers; she was looking forward to being there for them in retirement. Clary took that future away from her, so it is only fitting that he surrenders his.\"",

    "title": "La actividad económica quebró la tendencia bajista y creció 2,3% en mayo por el agro",
    "text": "Luego de varios meses de franca caída, la actividad económica registró un crecimiento 2,3% en la comparación interanual y de 1,3% respecto a abril en la medición desestacionalizada. A pesar del signo de recuperación, el acumulado de los primeros cinco meses de 2024 fue negativo en -2,9%. Los datos surgen del Estimador Mensual de la Actividad Económica (EMAE), que difunde el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INDEC). La medición interanual no arrojaba una cifra positiva desde octubre de 2023 (1,2%) mientras que la variación mensual desde agosto del año pasado (1%). “La expectativa del productor es de incertidumbre”, indicó el presidente de Confederaciones Rurales Argentinas De esta manera, la economía parece haber encontrado un piso en el bimestre comprendido entre marzo y abril tras la fuerte contracción de diciembre, enero y febrero debido al salto del tipo de cambio oficial de 118% y el pico inflacionario de 25,5%. Rubro por rubro: el comportamiento de la actividad económica en mayo &quot;Con relación a igual mes de 2023, seis sectores de actividad que conforman el EMAE registraron subas en mayo, entre los que se destacan Agricultura, ganadería, caza y silvicultura (+103,3% ia) y Electricidad, gas y agua (+11,0% ia). El sector Agricultura, ganadería, caza y silvicultura (+103,3% ia) fue, a su vez, el de mayor incidencia positiva en la variación interanual del EMAE, seguido por Explotación de minas y canteras (+7,6% ia)&quot;, indica el informe del INDEC. Además del notable alza del campo, que revirtió los resultados negativos de la sequía del año previo, otros tres rubros exhibieron registros positivos en mayo: Transporte y comunicaciones (2,6%), Enseñanza (0,9%) y Servicios sociales y de salud (0,2%). Por otra parte, nueve rubros de la economía experimentaron desplomes caídas en la medición anual, entre los que sobresalieron Construcción (-22,1% ia) e Industria manufacturera (-14,2% ia). Junto con Comercio mayorista, minorista y reparaciones (-11,41% ia) le restaron 4,6 puntos porcentuales al crecimiento interanual estimador. Actividad económica de mayo También retrocedieron los siguientes segmentos: Pesca (-10,5%), Hoteles y restaurantes (-7,2%), Intermediación financiera (-8,2%), Actividades inmobiliarias, empresariales y de alquiler (-0,6%), Administración pública y defensa; planes de seguridad social de afiliación obligatoria (-0,5%), Otras actividades de servicios comunitarios, sociales y personales (-5,4%), Impuestos netos de subsidios (-3,6%). Actividad económica: una consultora registró una caída en mayo De acuerdo a la medición de la consultora Orlando J. Ferreres &amp; Asociados, el nivel general de actividad marcó una caída de 4,4% interanual en mayo de 2024, acumulando para los primeros cinco meses del año una contracción de 6,0%. Por su parte, la medición desestacionalizada registró una caída de 0,8% respecto al mes precedente. &quot;EL IGA-OJF registró una caída durante mayo, consolidando un piso en el nivel de actividad. La medición desestacionalizada observó una baja de 0,8% respecto de abril, y aunque no cayó por debajo del piso de marzo, quedó cerca de ese nivel&quot;, reza el informe de la firma. En cuando al comportamiento de la economía, los sectores con mayor incidencia negativa fueron la industria (-9,8%), el comercio (-10,4%), la construcción (-20,2%) y la intermediación financiera (-10,5%). Por el otro lado, se destacó el agro, con cifras considerables por la comparación entre la actual campaña gruesa y la del año pasado, y la minería impulsada por la producción petrolera y gasífera en Vaca Muerta. &quot;Hacia adelante esperamos que en los próximos meses comience una lenta recuperación, contingente a que se consolide el ordenamiento de las variables macro y de que los ingresos de las familias crezcan por encima de la inflación&quot;, anticiparon los economistas.

    "text": "After a few months in its developer preview phase, Android 15’s first beta version is finally here – Google has just announced the availability of the beta version, which can be accessed by both developers and early adopters, provided that they enrol their device for the beta program. While we won’t know more about Android 15 until Google I/O, we do have an idea of what to expect at the moment.\nFor one, apps for Android 15 will be displayed edge-to-edge by default, so developers no longer have to call additional classes to show their content beyond system bars (fingers crossed that this finally addresses full-screen displays in games). Of course, Android 15 will also feature improvements for performance – this comes in the form of OS-level support for app archiving (as well as unarchiving), allowing users to free up space on their device from apps that they seldom use.\nREAD:\nAndroid 15 Developer Preview 2 released: Here are the changes\nFor privacy and security, the Android 15 beta will come with an OS-level API for end-to-to-end encryption for contact keys, which will allow users to securely manage and verify other people’s contact details. Additionally, Android TalkBack now supports Braille displays that use human interface devices via USB and bluetooth for better accessibility.\nOf course, there’s a lot more to discover with the first official beta for Android 15, but these are just some of the backend workings that we can expect within Android’s next big upgrade.",

A fifth paper, Religious Nationalism and Political Violence, will be reviewed in the next meeting on July 1.\nPTINew Delhi | June 26, 2025 13:09 IST\nA Delhi University panel’s decision to drop proposed postgraduate Political Science papers on Islam, Pakistan, and China has failed to find consensus among the members. While some called it ideological censorship, those who supported the decision termed it a step towards making the syllabus “India-centric” and free from bias.\nIn its meeting on Wednesday, DU’s Standing Committee for Academic Matters directed the removal of four elective papers — Islam and International Relations, Pakistan and the World, China’s Role in the Contemporary World, and State and Society in Pakistan. A fifth paper, Religious Nationalism and Political Violence, will be reviewed in the next meeting on July 1.\nOpposing the decision, committee member Professor Monami Sinha said such changes undermine critical thinking and reflect a push to dilute controversial but academically relevant content.\n“We argued that it is imperative to study Pakistan and China in detail. Ignoring these geopolitical realities would be academically short-sighted,” she said in a statement.\nShe also flagged the removal of references to caste, communal violence, and same-sex relationships in revised syllabi for Sociology and Geography.\nHowever, Professor Harendra Tiwari, also a member of the committee, supported the changes, calling the syllabus “agenda-driven” and lacking in balance.\n“Why only a paper on Islam and International Relations? Why not on Hinduism or Sikhism? We want a syllabus that serves students and our nation,” he told PTI.\nHe added that the dropped papers will not be reinstated unless the revised syllabus aligns with an “India-first” perspective.\nThe next committee meeting on July 1 is expected to see further debate on the syllabus.",

    "title": "'American Idol' Fans Can't Stand Carrie Underwood's Annoying Judging Habit",
    "text": "Carrie Underwood has returned to American Idol as a judge, marking a full-circle moment 20 years after winning the competition. Joining fellow judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan , Underwood brings a unique perspective, having experienced the show’s transformative journey from contestant to country music superstar. Unfortunately, some fans watching American Idol Season 23 don’t love one of Underwood’s judging habits. Here’s why viewers find her annoying.\n‘American Idol’ Season 23 judge Carrie Underwood annoys fans with 1 habit Carrie Underwood went on to become one of the most successful American Idol winners. She’s renowned throughout the country music world for her incredible voice and poignant lyrics. Now, she’s taking the reality TV singing competition world by storm as the new judge for American Idol Season 23 .\nShowrunner Megan Michaels Wolflick told TheWrap that “all roads led to Carrie” when deciding who would replace Katy Perry . “It just made so much sense to put [Carrie] in there, because she was bringing something new to the table that we never had before,” Michaels Wolflick said. “That firsthand experience is something that any other judge who’s ever been on the show can talk for years about what it’s like to stand on the oval, though they don’t know.”\nFans were excited to see Underwood back on the show that gave her monumental fame. However, some viewers aren’t happy with one of Underwood’s habits. Underwood often sings along with the contestants during their songs, and some fans find that her voice can be overpowering.\n“I do think Carrie is a good addition …,” one fan wrote on Reddit , “but I can’t stand how she sings along with the songs. I think if I were the contestant, that would throw me off to see her lip syncing right back at me.”\nAnother fan agreed. “I don’t mind it now during the performances because at least there’s a band,” they commented. “It was annoying during auditions because at times she was singing louder than the contestants.”\nOther viewers think the contestants should grow accustomed to watching others sing along to their songs if they want to perform for a living.\n“I feel like, if I were a contestant, I would feel better looking out to the crowd and seeing her having fun, singing along, and rocking out to my performance than looking out and seeing the judges looking serious and unmoved,” a fan countered.\nSome viewers think Carrie Underwood puts the focus back on the contestants American Idol viewers had divided opinions on Katy Perry as a judge. Perry wasn’t scared to express herself to the fullest, often making a public spectacle on the show. However, in American Idol Season 23, Carrie Underwood has all of her attention on the contestants, and she allows Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie to shine alongside her.\n“Carrie gives her full attention to the contestants while Katy was thinking about how to make it about herself,” a fan on Reddit said.\n“I agree, and I do love Katy, but I almost feel like with Carrie, we are also seeing more of Luke and Lionel’s personalities this season, too,” another fan noted. “Katy was kind of front and center, and now, it feels like the judges are more evenly spread out.”\nLionel Richie and Luke Bryan seem to enjoy the country singer as an ‘American Idol’ judge Related Carrie Underwood Appeared ‘Tense’ and ‘Serious’ While Filming ‘American Idol,’ Source Says\nAmerican Idol Season 23 fans were curious to see the dynamic between Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan, and Carrie Underwood. Katy Perry commanded the most attention as a judge. While Richie and Bryan loved Perry’s eccentric behavior, they also adore Underwood, even giving her the nickname “Jukebox Carrie” thanks to her ability to know and sing any song.\n“It’s amazing what she has up in that little jukebox head of hers,” Richie said. “I have never met anyone like that.”\nHowever, Richie does have one complaint about Underwood. While on Good Morning America , he claimed Underwood is “too nice” to the contestants. “She’s always saying, ‘But he’s so cute,'” he added.\nFor more news and exclusive interviews, follow Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram .",

    "text": "Checking out the new Sentral for Parents app are Executive Officer of the ACT Council of Parents and Citizens Associations, Veronica Elliott, Education Minister Yvette Berry, parent Lauryne Grant and Hawker Primary principal Amy Czoban. Photo: Ian Bushnell.\nPutting the kids on the bus to school may have had its moments this week, but one new piece of tech is set to make busy parents’ lives easier.\nHawker Primary School parent Lauryne Grant has been trialling the new Sentral for Parents app and has declared it a game-changer.\nThe app delivers all the functions of the Parent Portal – where school information and business can be securely accessed online – to your smartphone.\n“Going from a position where all of the information was scattered across emails and paper copies and on the newsletter and all over the place, it’s just wonderful to have that single source of truth now,” Ms Grant said\n“So if you miss anything, you don’t have to crawl back through your emails to find stuff.”\nREAD ALSO Education minister questions ‘for profit’ childcare after Genius staff walk out\nMs Grant said that before the Parent Portal, which was rolled out this year, the payment systems were archaic and difficult to manage, but the app also meant any fees could be paid on the go.\n“It really has made my life a lot easier,” she said.\n“We’re all working and have lots of things on, but you don’t necessarily have a finger on the pulse all the time.”\nAs a piece of tech, the app had good functionality, and the experience was seamless. Education Minister Yvette Berry puts that down to a managed phase-in so it wasn’t rushed.\n“We’ve been careful to make sure we phase it in to make sure it works straight up, starting with a smaller number of schools with the website and then developing the app and starting to roll the app out,” she said.\nEducation Minister Yvette Berry says more functions and improvements will be made to the app, including permission notes.\nMs Berry said the app was in response to parents who enjoyed using the Parent Portal but wanted more convenience.\nThe Portal has been gradually rolled out across all ACT public schools throughout this year and 24,405 parents have signed up.\nThis number is expected to grow now that the Sentral for Parents app is available.\nMs Berry said more functions and improvements would be added to the app as parent feedback came in, “because we know that there’s more that we can do, particularly around permission notes”.\n“That’s still something that’s required to be done in paper form but we want to see that moving to electronic access because that’ll change the contact that parents have with schools and just make it easier for everyone.”\nExecutive Officer of the ACT Council of Parents and Citizens Associations Veronica Elliott said the Parent Portal and now the app highlighted the collaboration and partnership between schools and families, which was key to improving student outcomes.\nMs Elliott said she was confident the app would make a real difference for parents and how they interacted with their children’s school\n“This app’s been through a lot of testing and the team at the directorate have been really responsive to feedback from council and from parents and carers in the community,” she said.\n“One of the things that we’ll be really excited about when it comes is the need to no longer complete paper forms for excursions and things like that because there is a lot of duplication in that process.”\nHawker Primary School principal Amy Czoban said the Parent Portal had already reduced paperwork, particularly with payments and teacher workload.\n“With everything being up there, and parents having access to everything, it means that there’s not as much chasing up that we have to do for notes and things like that, which is a job that the teachers would normally do, so this is definitely helping with the workload,” she said.\nREAD ALSO New figures show Emergency Department remedies are working, says Stephen-Smith\nAnd for those few who might be comfortable with old-fashioned paper, Ms Berry reassured them that they would not be left behind.\n“Schools will have ways that they communicate with parents, who might need that extra kind of contact,” she said.\n“I expect that at some point in the future, the app will used by all parents, but there will always be some families who just need different kinds of contact and schools can do that already.”\nParents of new ACT public school students, including those starting kindergarten in 2025, will receive a registration link and access key from their school. They will need to set up an ACT Digital Account if they don’t already have one to register.\nTo learn more about the Parent Portal and the Sentral for Parents app, visit the Education Directorate website .",

    "text": "Shakira quedó inmortalizada en una escultura de bronce que tiene una altura de 6.5 metros y tuvo la participación de más de 30 personas para la realización de la figura que se inauguró en Barranquilla-Colombia. Sin embargo, los usuarios dicen que hay una falta ortográfica-\nEn varias imágenes que difundieron en redes sociales, se observó la placa de la dedicatoria de la escultura que cuenta detalles de la realización y comparte un mensaje: “Un corazón que compone, unas caderas que no mienten, un talento inigualable, una voz que mueve masas y unos pies descalzos que marchan por el bien de la niñez y la humanidad”.\nEn la parte de abajo se ve quien fue el realizador de la obra pero hubo un error en el apellido y esto se hizo rápidamente viral.\nEn primer lugar, se lee: “Elaborado por el artista Yino Márques”, lo que evidencia que en esta parte su apellido fue escrito con la letra “s”.\nEn la parte de abajo, junto al nombre del alcalde, el nombre del artista es escrito diferente: “Márquez”, el cual termina esta vez en “Z”. Gracias a esta comparación, usuarios notaron el error. No obstante, hasta el momento nadie ha explicado la equivocación.\nY ahora ¿se escribe con s o con z? Según la “Real Academia Española (RAE), “la ortografía de los nombres y los apellidos tienen fijada una forma canónica que no puede ser modificada por los hablantes”.\nEn el caso del apellido del artista encargado de dar vida a la escultura de la barranquillera, ambas maneras con “s” y “z” son correctas. No obstante, se desconoce cómo realmente se escribe, debido a las dos denominaciones presentadas en la placa.",
