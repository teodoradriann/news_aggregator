    "text": "A warm, dry spring has U.S. forecasters worried about the upcoming wildfire season Most of the United States is expected to see warmer-than-average temperatures this spring, federal forecasters say, with dry conditions likely in the West. That's raising concerns about wildfires, especially in parts of the Southwest, Great Plains, and the Upper Mississippi River Valley, said Jon Gottschalck, operations branch chief at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. The southern High Plains, in particular, which includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, is going to be \"quite vulnerable to high wildfire risk, especially during high wind events,\" Gottschalck said Thursday on a call with reporters. Texas recently suffered the largest wildfire in the state's history, which investigators [say was started by power lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/texas-smokehouse-creek-fire-xcel-energy.html). In the Mid-Atlantic this week, high winds [helped fuel blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/virginia-wv-wildfires.html) in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. NOAA [released its Spring Outlook](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/spring-outlook-warmer-for-most-of-us-wetter-in-southeast) amid a stretch of record warm weather. Last month was the [hottest February on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-warmest-february-on-record), and 2023 was the [hottest year ever](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221827923/2023-hottest-year-record-climate-change). High average temperatures last year were exacerbated by a strong El Niño climate pattern, which is a [natural cycle](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186098964/with-el-nino-and-climate-change-this-week-saw-some-of-the-hottest-recorded-weath) that heats water in the Pacific Ocean and raises average temperatures worldwide. Gottschalck said the effects of the current El Niño are expected to weaken through the spring. But recent heat records are part of a longer warming trend that scientists expect to continue as climate change intensifies. Global temperatures are rising because of the accumulation of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, [according to the World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that,ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record.), which is part of the United Nations. Those greenhouse gasses come from humans burning fossil fuels. \"Climate change is affecting the timing, intensity, and duration of weather events in the United States,\" Rick Spinrad, NOAA's administrator, said in a news release. Forecasters also warned of low water levels on the Mississippi River this summer because of below-average snowpack and precipitation in the Northern Plains and the Midwest. Ed Clark, director of the National Water Center, said low-flow conditions could affect navigation on the entire Mississippi River system, as well as water supplies for communities and industries. NOAA doesn't expect major flooding anywhere in the country this spring. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "Al Levin, a longtime businessman known for his work in the Dayton entertainment business and his generosity, died Dec. 23.Levin, 98, of Centerville died of cancer.He was a World War II veteran who fought at the Battle of Okinawa, and when he returned to Dayton, he started Levin Service Company with his brother Sam and his twin, Lou.Levin Service Company operated several iconic Dayton businesses, including the Dixie Drive-In, which is still operated by the company, Kon-Ike Theater on Salem Avenue, the Rhino Restaurant in downtown Dayton, Caeser Creek Flea Market and Treasure Aisles Market. The company owned more than 17 movie theaters at one point.The brothers also ran the Levin Family Foundation, which was founded after Sam Levin died. The foundation focuses on alleviating hunger, homelessness and other basic needs in the Dayton region.“People had a lot of legitimate respect for him, held him in high regard and he was just a sweet guy,” said Ryan Levin, owner of Levin Service Company, which expanded into land development, and a board member on the Levin Family Foundation.Ryan Levin remembered Al Levin as someone who was concerned about the general welfare of people. He was a long-time member of the Optimist Club.“He was a very loyal businessman,” Ryan Levin said.Karen Levin, Al’s sister-in-law who was with him when he died, said Levin took pleasure in his work in the foundation.“Al was one of the most kind and gentle people you will ever want to meet,” she said. “He had a very strong sense of family and community.”Al and Lou Levin were inseparable, both Karen and Ryan Levin said.“I mean World War II together, everything in their lives, they’ve done together,” Karen Levin said. “They called themselves womb mates.”Karen Levin said Al Levin received his cancer diagnosis in November and due to his age, couldn’t receive treatment. At the doctor’s appointment, he sat for a minute, then told her that he’d lived a good life.His last wish was to die peacefully in his sleep at home, which Karen Levin said he was able to do. She sat with him on Saturday as he took his last breath.“I feel really bad because we’ve lost him, but he got his wish,” she said.Later, she went to his apartment to get a few things for his burial.“I walked in there and I looked at the bed because I almost expected to see him,” she said. “You can feel, you knew he had been there. But all of a sudden, there was just this sense of emptiness.”His funeral is scheduled for today Friday, Dec. 29 at 11 a.m. at the Beth Abraham Cemetery Chapel, 1817 West Schantz Ave. At 1 p.m., the family is having a light lunch at the Levin Family Foundation office, 7812 McEwen Rd., Dayton. Any donations to be made are requested to go to the Ohio Hospice of Dayton.",

The [Salvation Army](https://salvationarmyntx.org/) is one of several [warming shelters](/article/news/local/fort-worth-homeless-shelters-preparing-winter-weather/287-490faab7-ac67-41d2-a665-675aa07e22e9) in Collin County and is also one of the largest in the area. \"Because life is in danger, and they need to be protected,\" said Major Gabriel Elias with the Salvation Army. Major Elias says they had 60 people show up to the warming shelter earlier in the week when the temperatures first dipped. Organizers anticipate more people to show up this weekend into Tuesday as temperatures are [expected to plummet](/article/weather/dallas-texas-snow-forecast-arctic-blast-how-cold-timeline-fort-worth-dfw-weather/287-8bb6377d-b611-4cbb-abb7-27eb7e90d324). The vast majority of people who show up to the warming shelter are unhoused, according to Elias. \"There are some families that come. They don't have enough heaters,\" said Elias. \"I feel the pain of those people.\" Elias is doing exactly what he says he's always wanted to do: help. Now retired, he was a criminal lawyer in his home country of Mexico. He left all of it behind to offer his children opportunities in education. He's learned now that his moving to the U.S. also gave him an opportunity to help through the Salvation Army. \"I left everything so my kids [can be] university-graduated,\" Elias said. People have been slowly dropping off blankets and warm clothes at the drop-off at the McKinney location at 600 Wilson Creek Parkway. Volunteers are also staffed to help with meals and any other needs. \"We're in our nice warm beds at night, and they're cold. I just felt we've got to do something,\" said Sharon Reagan. The doors at the Salvation Army open at 7 p.m. on nights it is expected to dip below freezing. For now, there are plans to open at 7 p.m. until 8 a.m. each day for the next several days.",

This better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by robust demand for its software offerings.\nThe company highlighted the growing interest in generative AI, which significantly contributed to their success. IBM's cumulative business value has now surpassed $6 billion, marking an increase of over $1 billion within the quarter.\nCEO Arvind Krishna expressed optimism about the long-term prospects for both technology and the broader economy, despite acknowledging the volatile nature of the current macroeconomic environment. IBM plans to uphold its full-year forecasts for revenue growth and free cash flow, indicating confidence in sustained performance.",

    "text": "La DANA que azota la provincia de Huelva desde la madrugada del viernes se cebó con el litoral onubense, mientras que fue más benévola con la zona Norte. A las 5:00 de la madrugada la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) activaba el aviso rojo en la Costa, Condado y Andévalo por las lluvias torrenciales. El resto de comarcas del territorio onubense, por su parte, permanecía en aviso naranja. La mañana avanzaba y, alrededor de las 10:00, era el litoral la única parte del mapa que mantendría el aviso rojo hasta las 15:00. Solo dos horas después desaparecían todos los avisos por riesgos como consecuencia de los fenómenos meteorológicos adversos. Por estaciones meteorológicas de la Aemet, es la de Cartaya la que recogió más litros por metro cuadrado entre la medianoche y las 18:30 de este viernes -momento en el que las precipitaciones cesaron-, con 137,8 litros por metro cuadrado. Muy por encima de los 65,0 litros por metro cuadrado registrados en la capital entre la medianoche y la tarde de este viernes y los 72,7 de la estación de El Arenosillo, en el término municipal de Moguer. Son las tres estaciones de la Aemet que más precipitaciones registraron en la franja comprendida entre las 00:01 y la tarde del viernes. En lo que se refiere al resto de estaciones dispuestas por la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología a lo largo de la provincia de Huelva y, siempre con datos recogidos desde la medianoche hasta las 18:30, hay que destacar los 56,7 litros por metro cuadrado en la de El Cerro de Andévalo, los 51,0 en la de Villarrasa, los 35,0 de Alájar, los 34,8 de Alosno-Tharsis, los 33,0 en la de El Campillo, los 28,2 de Valverde del Camino, los 25,8 de la estación de Aroche o los 21,7 litros por metro cuadrado de Ayamonte. Por debajo de los 20 litros por metro cuadrado, se situaban las estaciones de Cala (19,2), El Granado (12,6) y Almonte (9,6). Todas estas cifras se refieren a las precipitaciones acumuladas en las estaciones meteorológicas de la Aemet, según los datos consultados hasta las 18:30.",
