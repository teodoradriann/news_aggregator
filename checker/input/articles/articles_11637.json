    "text": "The measures presented by the Department of Justice are part of a landmark case in Washington which has the potential to reshape how users find information. Send this page to someone via email\nThe United States Department of Justice on Wednesday argued in court that Google must sell Chrome, its flagship browser, to break what officials say amounts to a monopoly on online searches.\nExperts say the sale of a browser used by millions could have far-reaching impacts on the way people use the internet, and even help reshape what browsers of the future might look like.\nThe proposed measures would be in place for up to a decade, enforced via a court-appointed committee to remedy what the judge overseeing the case deemed an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising in the U.S., where Google processes 90 per cent of searches.\nCarmi Levy, a technology analyst, said if Google is forced to sell Chrome, the implications could be \"seismic\" and lead to uncertainty.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"This could be the industry's next Y2K if it comes to pass because so many workflows, so many apps, so many services rely on Chrome as a foundation. And if Google is no longer in position to maintain Chrome as that foundation, the entire industry is going to have to pivot,\" he said.\nLevy said any potential buyers would have to have \"deep pockets\" to maintain a global resource such as Chrome.\n\"It can't be a small tech startup. They have to have very deep engineering capabilities and that means it's a very short list. Frankly, I think Microsoft is at the top of that list.\"\nLevy said it might be some time before users notice a difference.\n\"In the short term, nothing changes,\" Levy added. \"But longer term, it's difficult to see where that's going to go,\" he said, adding that the user experience of the browser could change depending who buys the browser and how they treat your private data.\n2:11 Business Matters: Google granted 5-year exemption from Canada's Online News Act\nWill your smartphone look different?\nThe DOJ's proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to…\nUday Rana",

    "title": "25 ways to stay warm this winter that won’t break the bank",
    "text": "25 ways to stay warm this winter that won’t break the bank\nBy Kristen Rogers, CNN\n(CNN) — As wintry weather\nwhips across the United States, one challenge may be staying warm if you can’t afford or are cutting back on indoor heating.\nStaying warm is necessary “for a variety of health reasons” in addition to comfort, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association. For people with arthritis, stiffness “in your back and neck and sore joints do occur more in colder weather. … People who have metabolic conditions can be sensitive to the weather, like diabetes, for example, and heart disease. The more cold you are, th\ne more stress you put on your heart.”\nA little savvy based on our warm-blooded bodies, food, appliances, furniture,\nthe outdoor elements and more can go a long way. Here are 25 ways to stay warm this winter — with or without indoor heating — that won’t break the bank.\nHow to warm your body\n1. Warm up with store-bought hand warmers, microwavable heating pads, hot water bottles or heated blankets. Following the manufacturer’s instructions and concentrating on your torso are key, said JohnEric Smith, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology at Mississippi State University. “If you warm the core you can warm the hands and feet. It is harder to warm the core by warming the hands and feet.”\nBe careful that you don’t burn yourself, Benjamin said. “They’re very effective on a knee or shoulder or the back of the neck. … You rarely put it directly on your skin. You usually wrap it in something, maybe a thin towel.”\n2. Move your body. Physical activities like indoor exercise or dancing can help you warm up, but don’t get to the point where you’re sweating, Smith said. “We sweat to lose heat and sweating will make us colder.”\n3. Think twice about taking a warm shower or bath. “While a\nwarm bath or shower will feel good for the minute,” Smith said, “you will be cold after you get out and your wet skin is losing heat more quickly.”\n4. Cuddle. Snuggles really can keep you warm. “Each of us produces heat through our metabolic processes. We lose our heat to the environment as we maintain body temperature,” Smith said via email. “Increasing skin contact decreases opportunities for the heat to be lost to the environment around us. If two people are under a blanket both of their heat losses combined can increase the temperature under the blanket more quickly than either could do independently.”\n5. Change how you perceive cold. Some people have trained their minds to perceive cold as an objective, acceptable sensation rather than something dreadful to control. The best ways to adapt include wearing clothing in layers then removing it, or gradually lowering the thermostat and putting on a sweater, Benjamin said.\nWarmth that’s comforting\n6. Enjoy warm\nbeverages and foods, and use the oven and stove to cook them. Since foods higher in fat and protein are metabolized slowly by the body, those could make you feel warmer, Smith said. “Consider hearty soups with beans and meat.” Slow cooking meals can help generate heat throughout the day.\nDrinking\nwarm beverages “certainly helps take the chill off,” Benjamin said. Leaving the oven or stove on is “a bad idea because it burns fuel,” Benjamin said, “but more importantly, people fall asleep, they forget and leave the stove on. Sometimes things on the stove can catch on fire. So like any tool, you should use it for the purpose in which it was designed.”\n“It only has to go poorly once to be life changing,” Smith said. If you don’t have children or pets, when you’re done cooking and you turn off the oven, what doesn’t hurt is leaving the oven door open to let residual heat escape.\nHow to dress for the cold\n7. Layer on the clothes. “Layering is critical,” Smith said. “Even thin layers added together to increase one’s\nability to retain heat … focus on keeping the torso warm. Often an extra shirt or vest can warm your hands and feet more than an extra pair of socks or gloves.” Inexpensive pairs of tights or long johns can be worn underneath clothes. However, be sure that layering doesn’t make your clothing tight, he added, since that could reduce blood flow and thus your body’s ability to get warm blood to those areas. Wearing a hat, too, can also keep the heat in.\n8. Wear thick socks and slippers. Fuzzy socks, slippers or a pair of shoes you reserve for wearing around the house can add extra comfort.\n9. Pile on the blankets. “The more layers you put on, the better it helps trap the air between you,” your sheets\nand your blankets, Benjamin said. Since you lose a lot of heat from your head while you’re under blankets, he added, wearing a skull cap can help also.\n10. Embrace less breathable clothing and linens. Breathable linens (such as the cotton-based variety) are often recommended during the summer, but linens with other materials and higher thread counts may be better for winter since higher thread counts have more weaving per square inch.\nOptimize your home and appliances\n11. Work with the weather. Open your curtains or blinds to let the sun in during the day, or when outside is warmer than inside your home.\n12. Seal your windows and doors. Even if your windows and doors are totally shut and locked, drafts can seep in through small crevices. You can use caulk or shrink film to seal those cracks. Placing inexpensive, transparent shower curtains over windows can keep the sun in but the cold draft out. For the bottoms of doors, cloth draft stoppers are “very effective,” Benjamin said.\n13. Close off unoccupied rooms. By shutting the doors of rooms no one is using, you can create additional barriers between yourself and the cold outdoors. This can also aid preventing heat loss from the room you’re in.\n14. Reverse your ceiling fan. If possible, send your ceiling fan in a clockwise direction so that it sends the warm air down.\n15. Sit near indoor heaters. You can safely use portable heaters if they are space heaters that have automatic shutoffs and can be plugged into a wall outlet instead of an extension cord. Since space heaters are a common cause of fires, they should be at least\n3 feet away from any drapes, bedding or furniture. To prevent high levels of carbon monoxide — which can cause potentially fatal poisoning — ensure you have a carbon monoxide monitor installed and that you don’t “use any type of outdoor gas heater or anything that is not electric,” Benjamin said.\n16. Move anything that’s blocking heat vents or radiators. The heat will better circulate throughout your home that way.\n17. Spend time and sleep in the upper levels of the house. Heat rises, so moving your working, sleeping and living spaces upward may be more comfortable.\n18. After showering, don’t run the bathroom fan or close the door. Unless your bathroom is prone to growing humidity-induced mold, the warm steam from the shower can make the nearby air less dry and cool for a short period of time.\n19. Buy magnetic vent covers from home improvement stores. Used to cover vents, they can be inexpensive and help to force heat to exit vents in the occupied rooms only.\n20. Put down rugs or carpets. These can be warmer to the touch than bare floors.\n21. Insulate your attic. If you can afford to, padding your attic with insulation from hardware stores can help to retain some of the heat you usually lose through the attic since heat rises.\n22. Research what your residential area offers. Some locations may be running warming centers set up for safety during the pandemic.\nCozy up near the elements\n23. Light a fire. If your fireplace runs on wood instead of gas, a fire is another way to keep a room warm and enjoy a cozy night. “Make sure that your flue is properly opened and clean to make sure that smoke doesn’t come back in the home but goes properly up the flue,” Benjamin said. “When the fire is out, you should of course close the flue because it’s like having an open window.”\n24. Keep warm and enjoy s’mores. If your state, city, county or neighborhood allows, have a (moderate-size) backyard bonfire to keep warm for a while.\n25. Don’t light candles. Candles can emit a small amount of heat, but using them as a source of warmth can be dangerous. “People will light candles and go to sleep, and they fall over,” Benjamin said. “The cat comes in and kicks it over and starts a fire.”\nWith these tips in mind and any others you find, be “broadly thoughtful about how to stay warm in the winter,” he added. “If it sounds like it’s a bad idea, it probably is. Look it up and check it out before you do it.”\nThis story has been updated to reflect recent weather advisories.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

    "text": "By Dr Mukesh Batra\nWinter can be a challenging time for individuals living with arthritis, as the cold weather tends to exacerbate joint pain and stiffness. Recent reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that osteoarthritis predominantly affects individuals aged 55 and above, with 73 per cent falling into this age group, and 60 per cent of those affected being female. The data further indicates that the knee is the most commonly impacted joint, followed by the hip and hand, leading to a prevalence of 365 million arthritis patients. Given the ageing populations, rising obesity rates, and increased instances of injury, the global prevalence of osteoarthritis is anticipated to persistently rise.\nOsteoarthritis can arise from various factors, including a history of joint injury or overuse, older age, and excess weight, with a higher prevalence observed among women compared to men.\nPrioritise regular exercise to sustain joint health Engaging in indoor workouts, such as yoga or gentle stretching exercises, maintains flexibility and supports heart health. Regular physical activity can contribute to a substantial 40 per cent reduction in pain and notable improvement in function for adults dealing with arthritis.\nWeight management matters: A key to pain reduction The holiday season often brings indulgence, and the colder weather may discourage outdoor activities, potentially leading to unwanted weight gain. Managing a healthy weight is paramount, as even a slight increase can intensify joint pressure, worsening pain. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight enables adults to ease arthritis pain and enhance overall function. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, weight loss emerges as an effective, non-drug method to manage arthritis and joint pain.\nHeat therapy for aching joint Embracing the healing power of heat proves to be an effective strategy for combating aching joints during winter. Electric heating pads or hot water bags can provide targeted relief, while warm water soaks or hot baths effectively alleviate joint aches and induce muscle relaxation. Studies by the Arthritis Foundation indicate that heat treatments can effectively alleviate muscle discomfort and promote increased flexibility in stiff joints.\nEnsure adequate vitamin D intake for joint health Vitamin D plays a crucial role in joint health, and during winter, when sunlight exposure is limited, it becomes even more essential. Lack of this fat-soluble nutrient can contribute to muscle and joint pain, as well as increase the risk of osteoporosis. Boosting Vitamin D levels by spending time outdoors when possible and incorporating Vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish, egg yolks, orange juice, cereals, and oatmeal into the diet becomes crucial during the winter months.\nHomoeopathy for arthritis As a complementary medical system, homoeopathy offers holistic treatments that are safe and without any side effects. Homoeopathy works by modulating the body's immunity, which helps to reduce joint inflammation. Furthermore, it helps to slow the progression of the condition. These therapies work well to relieve pain, edema, and joint stiffness. Prioritise your safety and well-being by seeking appropriate medical assistance and following the advice of a certified homoeopath.\n(The author is a Padmashree recipient, and the founder and chairman of Dr Batra’s Healthcare).\n[Disclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal and do not reflect the opinions, beliefs, and views of ABP News Network Pvt Ltd].\nCheck out below Health Tools-\nCalculate Your Body Mass Index ( BMI )\nCalculate The Age Through Age Calculator",
