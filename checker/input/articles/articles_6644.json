    "text": "During the AMD leadership meeting with the press at CES 2025, the company was asked about the shortage of Ryzen 7 9800X3D. According to AMD, it is caused by the “horrible” Intel Arrow Lake.\nAMD boasted unprecedented demand and noted that the release of “horrible”, in the company’s opinion, Intel Arrow Lake processors , led to a crazy increase in demand for AMD processors with 3D V-Cache, which are considered the best chips for gaming.\n“We knew we had created something great. We didn’t know that the competitor had created something horrible. So the demand was a little higher than we anticipated,” joked Frank Azor, head of AMD’s gaming division.\nThe performance of Arrow Lake chips in games disappointed many during their launch. According to Tom’s Hardware, a “complete” patch of this issue , tested on several systems, did not fix the situation. The latest version of Windows, recommended by Intel, brought more benefits to its competitors — the site has not yet published this study and will do so soon.\n“We were ramping up our production capabilities, monthly, quarterly output of X3D components, and this includes both the 7000 [series] and the 9000X3D. It’s insane how much we increased the plans. I would say the demand for 9800X3D and 7800X3D was unprecedented,” says AMD head David McAfee.\nAMD noted that they do not have any production complications or any “bottleneck” in manufacturing, but increasing it takes time. The company says that new 9950X3D and 9900X3D processors will not help cover the deficit since customers predominantly choose 8-core X3D processors at a ratio of 10 to 1 to X3D models with more cores.\nSource: Tom’s Hardware",

    "title": "Why Emmie & Bridget Really Left 'Farmer Wants A Wife' 2025 | marie claire",
    "text": "The new season of Farmer Wants A Wife has only just begun, but viewers have already witnessed a fair share of trouble in pastoral paradise. Namely, the shock departure of Emmie and Bridget, after the first week with Farmer Tom failed to sow the seeds of affection.\nNoticeably uncomfortable with the whole sheep shearing exercise – which to be fair, can be quite confronting for most people – Emmie explained she was content to remain an “observer” rather than a participant.\nLater that evening, when the group was prepping dinner with Farmer Tom, Emmie and Bridget looked on from the sidelines, choosing to head back to their rooms for a moment of peace while the night continued on.\nPrompted by a message from host Natalie Gruzlewski asking the farmers to select two ladies for a double date, Farmer Tom decided to use the opportunity as a “check in” with both Emmie and Bridget. Meanwhile, Bridget and Emmie were packing their things, having already made the decision to leave well before Farmer Tom even had the chance to say goodbye.\nFor his part, Farmer Tom remained composed enough to wish them well, commenting “It’s good that they know what they are after.”\nWith barely enough time to get a full to-camera from each of the ladies, producers were scrambling to get the inside scoop behind their sudden exit. But lucky for us, both Emmie and Bridget have been more than willing to spill the tea in the days following their on-screen departure, and we are graciously accepting every sip.\nWhy Did Emmie Leave Farmer Tom On Farmer Wants A Wife?\nAs the cameras frantically tried to catch Emmie before she closed the door on farm life forever, she offered up a relatable explanation: “We gave it all we could. But what’s the point in staying if there isn’t something there that both of us want to pursue?”\nViewers were quick to pounce on the pair, calling them rude and impolite for leaving without saying goodbye. But if you were in their situation – one week in – wouldn’t you do the same? Plus, getting a taxi in a rural location is no easy feat. As soon as that cab is available – you grab it and go! So can we really blame them?\nIn the days following, Emmie has been openly sharing her grievances with her Instagram followers, and we are hanging on every word.\nIn a post to her stories, Emmie explained that both she and Bridget made the decision because they weren’t going to “settle for disrespect.”\n“What was happening behind the scenes didn’t align with who I am or what I stand for. There was immaturity, selfishness, and toxic behaviour that I wasn’t willing to tolerate especially from someone I was supposed to be building a connection with,” she wrote.\n“Walking away was the healthiest & BEST choice I could make for myself,” she concluded – and if that’s not a refreshing take on the reality show rodeo than we don’t know what is.\nIn a subsequent IG Q&A, Emmie went into detail, letting her followers know that she had “absolutely zero tolerance for grown adults who think it’s okay to bully, belittle, or gang up on someone.”\n“Watching someone constantly get dragged down by the same toxic behaviour? Not on my watch. I will always stand up for the ones who are kind, quiet, or different because they deserve support, not cruelty. We’re too old for high school drama. Be better.”\nShe also had some choice words for Farmer Tom, who she called “immature” after revealing she had “icky vibes” about him from the start.\nWhy Did Bridget Leave Farmer Tom On Farmer Wants A Wife?\nAs producers watched the ladies leave Farmer Tom’s homestead, they reached out with one last question, asking Bridget why she wouldn’t stay to say goodbye, to which she responded: “I’m sorry, I’m gonna politely decline.”\nIn the days following, Bridget also shared details of her own through her dog’s Instagram account @laceythegreyhound – which is a legendary move in itself.\n“There’s so much the show didn’t reveal,” Lacey – aka Bridget – revealed in a series of Instagram stories this week.\n“They left out the moment when the farmer was openly rude to my Ma in front of everyone, just hours after she arrived on the farm. Other contestants and the House A/P (featured in my story) immediately checked in with her, concerned about how she’d been treated. My Ma retreated to her room to read a book because this made her feel safe in an uncomfortable environment,” she added.\nIn another shock turn of events, Lacey revealed that Farmer Tom admitted to the ladies that he actually didn’t even sign onto the show himself. Instead, his mother had “done it all for him” which as she noted “changes the whole context.”\nLet’s be real – that’s a glaring red flag in itself, and the admission alone would be enough for most viewers to go running for the hills – let alone everything else.\nPlus, can we just normalise contestants leaving reality tv shows when the experience is no longer serving them? Why force themselves into a situation they weren’t comfortable with for the viewers?\nMore of this, please and thank you.",

    "text": "TN lineman laid to rest after being hit, killed by alleged drunk driver in Alabama\nThomas Ferrell was repairing downed powerlines at an intersection when he was hit and killed by an alleged drunk driver.\nGOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - A Tennessee lineman has been laid to rest after he was killed by an alleged drunk driver while he was on the job in Alabama.\nIn March, 49-year-old Thomas Ferrell, of White House, went to Talladega County, Alabama, to help repair a powerline damaged by a tornado.\nAccording to WSMV sister station WBRC, Ferrell was repairing powerlines in the Ashland Highway/Mount Olive Circle and Mountain View Road intersection when the crash happened.\nWBRC reports that Ferrell was walking across Ashland Highway, while wearing a fluorescent green safety jacket, when he was hit by a pickup truck driven by Miguel Manzana-Martinez, 45, of Talladega. Police say Manzana-Martinez was believed to have been drunk when the crash happened.\nOn Wednesday, WSMV spoke with Ferrell’s son outside his visitation, who said he remembers his dad for his dedication to helping others – which is what he was doing when he passed.\n“He cared for everybody. He loved working. That’s what he loved doing. He loved chasing storms. He would get on a job in a heartbeat if he had to,” Drew Ferrell said.\nManzana-Martinez is still in jail in Talladega County and has been charged with manslaughter, first-degree assault and driving under the influence. He is being held on a $50,000 cash bond in the Talladega County Jail.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Reports: Death Toll in Venezuela Anti-Socialist Protests Rises to 24",
    "text": "The Venezuelan Education-Action Program on Human Rights (Provea), a non-governmental organization, stated in a report published on Tuesday that it has so far confirmed 24 people killed under the brutal repression of the socialist government there.\nNationwide protests erupted in Venezuela after the National Electoral Council (CNE) declared Nicolás Maduro the “winner” of the July 28 sham presidential election. Although Venezuela’s top electoral authorities moved to rapidly certify Maduro’s “victory” less than 24 hours after polls closed, they have refused to publish vote tallies and scrutiny documents that can prove Maduro obtained the roughly 51 percent of the votes the CNE claims he got.\nThe Venezuelan opposition has contested CNE’s “results,” publishing vote tallies allegedly obtained from voting stations throughout the country on July 28 that, they claim, can demonstrate their candidate, 74-year-old former diplomat Edmundo González, defeated Maduro by a landslide.\nSeveral countries, including the United States , have called the CNE’s claimed results into question and recognized González as the winner of the sham election.\nMaduro — who has illegitimately clung to power in multiple unfree elections — has only been congratulated by other allied rogue regimes such as China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia, and Nicaragua, as well as by nations that have maintained friendly ties with the ruling socialists over the past 25 years such as Dominica, Honduras, and Antigua and Barbuda.\nMaduro and his authoritarian socialist regime have responded to the protests with a fierce persecution campaign against dissidents. Maduro said last week that his regime’s security officials have detained over 2,000 dissidents and promised to send them to “ reeducation” centers that the socialist regime is building on the grounds of two of Venezuela’s most infamous prisons, which were emptied of their inmates by Venezuelan security forces in late 2023.\nProvea noted in the report that most of the documented protests have taken place in barrios and other low-income areas of Caracas and other cities of the country.\n“Provea has recorded 24 deaths between Sunday, July 28 and Monday, August 5 in events and protests related to the July 28 elections,” the NGO’s report stated.\nProvea said that the colectivos , armed socialist gangs at the service of Maduro, were involved in at least nine of the registered homicides, citing eyewitnesses. In addition to the colectivos , Provea stated, the Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions (DAET) of the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) has been identified as responsible in two cases of assassination of protesters.\n“The participation of these groups in open coordination with law enforcement agents in suppressing demonstrations, attacks on polling stations on election day and acts of threats and harassment against opponents has been widely documented,” the report reads.\nSimilarly, the National Union of Press Workers of Venezuela (SNTP) denounced on Wednesday that the Maduro regime has carried out the arbitrary detention of four journalists and graphic reporters, who are now facing “terrorism” charges for having covered the protests.\nThe Maduro regime has also used its smartphone applications and regime-developed social media platforms to hunt down dissidents, in addition to relaunching Operation Tun Tun (“Knock Knock”), a persecution campaign that hunts down dissidents in their homes, forcing them to “confess” their “crimes” and issue “public apologies” to Maduro.\nMaduro claims that the protests against his regime are part of a purported “international Zionism” plot to overthrow his authoritarian rule. The socialist dictator has accused several regional heads of state – such as Argentina’s Javier Milei, El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele, Chile’s Gabriel Boric, and Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa – as well as former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Spain’s populist Vox party – of all taking part in the “Zionist” plot against him.\nForo Penal, another Venezuelan non-governmental organization, announced on Thursday morning that it has been able to confirm and identify 1,229 individuals arbitrarily detained by Maduro regime forces during the protests. Out of the total confirmed, Foro Penal explained, 105 are teenagers, five are indigenous people, 16 are disabled, and 157 are women.\nForo Penal’s president, Alfredo Romero, told the Argentine outlet Infobae on Wednesday that most of the detainees are young people, who average 20 years of age.\n“The regular pattern, let’s say new, that occurred with regard to these indiscriminate detentions, is the restriction of the right to defense,” Romero said. “Private defense is not allowed. They are imposed on them by the State Defender and the hearings are conducted with the persons locked up in the detention centers, mostly without allowing the detainee access to any communication with the outside.”\n“There is also no communication with family members. This has not allowed them, obviously, to know the physical state or the health condition of the person because they have not been seen, we have not talked to them, we have not been able to verify it,” he continued. “Including minors who have also not had, for the most part, the possibility for family members to talk to them and see them.”\nProvea concluded its report by denouncing that it had begun to receive reports of acts of harassment, dismissals, and job demotions of public administration employees for political reasons.\n“These acts, which, we warn, could escalate in the coming days, have been recorded in other periods of high conflict and constitute crimes of discrimination for political reasons that violate the right to work and the right to personal integrity,” Provea stated.\n“Denying people the human right to democracy, to electoral truth and repressing those who demand these basic principles, is a crime against human rights. Power and sovereignty reside in the people, who want guarantees that their decisions and political destiny will be respected,” the report concluded.\nThe Venezuelan Armed Forces, which have been at the forefront of the brutal repression against protesters and dissidents, together with the Venezuelan police forces, reiterated their “ absolute loyalty ” to Nicolás Maduro on Tuesday, claiming that he is the “constitutional president” of Venezuela and “commander in chief” of the armed forces.\nChristian K.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) [#2](c2#c-2) no se qué veis de incomprensible\nNo sólo se ha facilitado y propiciado durante siglos, sino que en los últimos años, aún se les ha dado más manga ancha.\nPor lo visto, con eso de que toda la gente le pide tanto a su dios continuamente, se debe de amortizar de algún modo.\nEn fin, magufadas, lo normal.. mientras formen parte del adn político-socio-cultural.\n[#2](c2#c-2) El PSOE de antes de la guerra civil participó en la Constitución española que incluyó el siguiente artículo:\nArtículo 26.\nTodas las confesiones religiosas serán consideradas como Asociaciones sometidas a una ley especial.\nEl Estado, las regiones, las provincias y los Municipios, no mantendrán, favorecerán, ni auxiliarán económicamente a las Iglesias, Asociaciones e Instituciones religiosas.\nUna ley especial regulará la total extinción, en un plazo máximo de dos años, del presupuesto del Clero.\nQuedan disueltas aquellas Órdenes religiosas que estatutariamente impongan, además de los tres votos canónicos, otro especial de obediencia a autoridad distinta de la legítima del Estado. Sus bienes serán nacionalizados y afectados a fines benéficos y docentes.\nLas demás Órdenes religiosas se someterán a una ley especial votada por estas Cortes Constituyentes y ajustada a las siguientes bases:\n1ª. Disolución de las que, por sus actividades, constituyan un peligro para la seguridad del Estado.\n2ª. Inscripción de las que deban subsistir, en un Registro especial dependientes del Ministerio de Justicia.\n3ª. Incapacidad de adquirir y conservar, por sí o por persona interpuesta, más bienes que los que, previa justificación, se destinen a su vivienda o al cumplimiento directo de sus fines privativos.\n4ª. Prohibición de ejercer la industria, el comercio o la enseñanza.\n5ª. Sumisión a todas las leyes tributarias del país.\n6ª. Obligación de rendir anualmente cuentas al Estado de la inversión de sus bienes en relación con los fines de la Asociación.\nLos bienes de las Órdenes religiosas podrán ser nacionalizados.\nhttps://www.congreso.es/constitucion/ficheros/historicas/cons_1931.pdf\nLuego en pleno franquismo, en 1974, se compró a base de talonario al PSOE en el congreso de Suresnes. Y desde entonces el PSOE \"actual\" pasó a ser pseudofranquista, dado que a pesar de haber tenido una mayoría absoluta en el 82, mantiene privilegios y protege con uñas y dientes a tooooooda la herencia del franquismo: ejército, judicatura, monarquía, FFCCSE, grandes fortunas nacidas del latrocinio franquista, iglesia, etc.. Ha tardado décadas en quitar parte (que no todos) de los monumentos que glorificaban a Franco y al franquismo.\nEspecialmente a la iglesia le aumentó el % que se llevan de la \"X\" de la renta, y le han dejado carta blanca para expandirse por servicios esenciales como educación, residencias, sanidad, etc, a la vez que se ha permitido el pago con dinero público para los negocios privados de la multinacional vaticana.\nPor un Concordato fullero prorrogado del franquismo se ha librado la iglesia de ser juzgada por todos los casos de abusos sexuales a menores que lleva perpetrando \"desde siempre\" y hasta nuestros días, y está exenta de pagar la mayoría de impuestos que sí pagamos el resto de los súbditos. ¡Con la excusa de que no tienen dinero! Luego te enteras de que a raíz de inmatricularse a su nombre la Mezquita de Córdoba por 30€ están sacando un beneficio EN NEGRO (sin tributar por ello) de hasta 18 millones de euros al año. Y tienen 99.999 propiedades más dedicadas a su dios verdadero: EL DINERO\n[#4](c4#c-4) Primero hay que derogar el Concordato y luego establecer un sistema de financiación como el alemán, cortando cualquier atisbo de dinero público para la secta y donde sean los fieles los que paguen y mantengan a la secta con un 8-9% de su dinero.\nDespués, si se ve que ya casi no hay adeptos a la secta, desamortización con la restauración del artículo 26 de la anterior Constitución española (ver\n[#33](c33#c-33)). Que dicho artículo se redactó así por algo, todos sus puntos tienen un sentido recogido de un porqué histórico, menudos problemas ha dado la iglesia en España desde siempre, conspirando, adoctrinando, abusando y trincando todo lo público que les ha venido en gana sin pagar por ello.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Estas sectas siempre están disponibles para entrar en los negocios de verdad: nadie mejor que ellos para legitimizar y glorificar golpes de estado y dictadores genocidas como los que han propiciado el expolio en España o la religión que alimenta con su irracionalidad la invasión de Palestina.\n[#11](c11#c-11) No se donde leí que la desamortización de Mendizabal fue quitarle tierras a la iglesia para repartírselas luego 4 señoritos ricos.\nAdenda (De la susodicha desamortización de Mendizabal en la wikipedia) :\nLos pequeños labradores no pudieron entrar en las pujas y las tierras fueron compradas por nobles y burgueses urbanos adinerados, de forma que no pudo crearse una verdadera burguesía o clase media en España que sacase al país de su marasmo.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Añádele que, según alguinos cálculos, suposu la deforestación de entre el cinco y el 7% de todo el país, una ruina para el partrimionio artístico y una ruina fatal para los aparceros que pasaron de estar en \"renta antigua\" a no poder vivir de sus tierras.\nUn desastre.\nA mi me hace bastante gracia, ( por decirlo suavemente) cada vez que paso por la calle Almagro de Madrid por la puerta de un conjunto de edificios de la Iglesia que abarcan toda una enorme manzana y que probablemente este en el podium de los terrenos más caros de todo Madrid. ¿sabeis como se llama la congregación que vive allí? Hermanitas de los pobres. Con dos ovarios.\nY empezaron con un establo!\nHay que desamortizar todos los bienes cuyo uso no sea el de templo para oficios reliosos o monasterios.\nLas residencias de los curas, obispos y demás deben estar a su nombre y pagar los impuestos correspondientes como persona física.\n[#18](c18#c-18)\nNo me hagas reír.\nInmuebles para caridad ?\nPor eso no pagan IBI ,ni IVA y muy probablemente esas monjas cobraban en negro.\nDecía Saramago que la Iglesia solo ha servido para separar, quemar y torturar\nNunca para unir a la gente.\nLa Iglesia es el Gran Parásito de nuestra sociedad..",
