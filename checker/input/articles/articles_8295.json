    "text": "City dwellers thrilled by magnificent aurora borealis display over the Big Apple: ‘Absolutely speechless!’ Lights, camera, aurora! New Yorker’s were left awestruck Thursday night when the night sky was illuminated by a breathtaking aurora borealis display over the Big Apple. “It has been a LONG time since we’ve seen visible aurora over NYC,” X account New York Metro Weather wrote in a post that included a photo of the vibrant shades of purple and pink visible high above the bustling city streets. “And it will likely be a long time until we see it again. Go outside and look up!” Many New Yorkers did in fact go outside and look up – and they weren’t the only ones, as the northern lights show was visible over a much larger swath of the globe than experts initially expected. The aurora borealis was witnessed as far south as Washington DC, and across the pond in the United Kingdom. “Wow, absolutely speechless!” New York City-based meteorologist Allan Nossoff wrote in all caps on X. “These aurora visible with the naked eye #NYC!” Another city dweller who couldn’t contain their excitement simply wrote : “A .” One X user in New Jersey posted photos of the overwhelming vision from their backyard and asked: “why is the aurora literally in my backyard?” Another X user showed a panoramic view from Fair Haven, NY, on the banks of Lake Oswego. Even in Lewes, Delaware, the striking scene made for a shot worth posting for one X user. England’s Met Office shared photos that meteorologists there took from various locations around the isle. Folks as far as the French Alps were blessed with the once-in-a-lifetime sight. The cause for Mother Nature’s special effects is a coronal mass ejection (CME) which erupted from the Sun earlier in the day. That outburst triggered geomagnetic storms, which produced the trippy effects on the night sky here on Earth. The severity of the CME dictates how visible the aurora will be. Meteorologists did not expect Thursday’s storm to be as powerful as it turned out. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said earlier Thursday that expectations were for the aurora to only be somewhat visible from upstate New York – but that people in the city would miss out on the prime sky-peeping. The CME was apparently strong enough to provide the other-worldly display to cover a large swath of the Atlantic coast. Experts say that the expanded aurora may be visible in parts of the world for as many as a couple days – but that by Friday night the lights should be out in New York City.",

    "text": "Top-Talent kritisiert FC Bayern nach Abgang\nEin offensives Top-Talent verlässt den FC Bayern und kritisiert anschließend mangelnde Kommunikation. Eine Rückkaufklausel bleibt dem FCB erhalten.\nMünchen – Einst als Shootingstar gefeiert, verlässt Nestory Irankunda den FC Bayern mit gemischten Gefühlen. Der australische Nationalspieler kritisiert im Zuge seines Transfers zu Watford den Umgang des Rekordmeisters mit ihm – und zeigt sich enttäuscht von der fehlenden Kommunikation.\nTop-Talent Nestory Irankunda kritisiert FC Bayern nach Abgang\nAm Flughafen in London-Heathrow, auf dem Weg zu seinem neuen Klub Watford, sprach Nestory Irankunda offen über seinen Abschied vom FC Bayern – und offenbarte dabei auch eine gewisse Enttäuschung. „Es war eine sehr harte Entscheidung“, sagte der 19-Jährige gegenüber Sky Sports Australia – um dann nachzuschieben: „Als ich von der Leihe zurückkam, habe ich das erste Team nicht wirklich gesehen. Ich konnte eigentlich mit niemandem sprechen.“\nVor seiner Leihe zu den Grasshoppers Zürich im Januar 2025 hatte Irankunda eigenen Angaben zufolge noch ein paar Gespräche mit Trainer Vincent Kompany geführt. Nach seiner Rückkehr blieb der Kontakt jedoch aus – kein Austausch, keine Perspektive. „Aber das ist Teil des Fußballs“, sagte der Offensivspieler lapidar – nicht ohne einen Anflug von Ironie.\nWechsel nach Watford: WM-Traum statt Bayern-Bank\nIrankunda wechselte im Sommer 2024 für weniger als eine Million Euro von Adelaide United zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister kam er ausschließlich in der zweiten Mannschaft zum Einsatz (15 Spiele, 4 Tore). Die Rückrunde verbrachte er dann auf Leihbasis in der Schweiz, wo er für Grasshopper Club Zürich immerhin 21 Pflichtspiele absolvierte (1 Tor, 3 Assists).\nNun folgt der dauerhafte Abschied – zum englischen Zweitligisten Watford FC, der rund vier Millionen Euro Ablöse bezahlt haben soll. Für Irankunda ein logischer Schritt: „Ich muss spielen. Die Weltmeisterschaft 2026 steht vor der Tür und ich will dabei sein“, so der schnelle Außenstürmer.\nGleichzeitig erfülle sich mit dem Wechsel nach England auch ein Kindheitstraum. Den Watford-Fans versprach er: „Ich bin ziemlich schnell, ich habe einen guten Schuss. Ich will die Zuschauer zum Ausrasten bringen.“\nBayern sichert sich Rückkauf-Option\nGanz abgeschlossen hat der FC Bayern mit Irankunda offenbar nicht. Nach Informationen von Transfer-Insider Fabritio Romano soll sich der Klub eine Rückkaufklausel gesichert haben – ein Modell, das bereits bei anderen Talenten Anwendung fand. Zudem soll den Münchnern eine 50-Prozent-Beteiligung bei einem zukünftigen Weiterverkauf zustehen. (Dieser Artikel entstand in Kooperation mit FCBinside.de)",

    "text": "Operation Home for the Holidays Published Dec. 29, 2023 By Senior Airman Evan Lichtenhan 5th Bomb Wing Public Affairs MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. -- A new program, Operation Home for the Holidays, was recently instituted by U.S. Air Force Col. Daniel Hoadley, 5th Bomb Wing commander, U.S. Air Force Col. Kenneth McGhee, 91st Missile Wing commander, with the city of Minot Chamber of commerce. This program was put in place to raise funds for single Airmen to visit their families during the holiday season free of charge. Airmen were offered the opportunity to visit their families either during Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year’s Day. The program raised approximately $125,000 and was able to send over 115 Airmen from Minot AFB home for the holidays. Airman 1st Class Bryce Conner, 705th Munitions Squadron nuclear weapons technician, chose to visit his family in Pennsylvania during Christmas and New Year’s Day. “I had to fill out a form with a few questions regarding why it would benefit me, what I was looking forward to the most, and then send it to the First Sergeant,” said Conner. “I am looking forward to seeing my family and my girlfriend who has not moved out here yet.” Airman 1st Class Xavier Patton, 91st Missile Security Forces Squadron missile security operator, is looking forward to going back to Phoenix, Arizona, where he will catch up with his younger sister. “I am excited to get back to the good weather and to see my family. I’m especially looking forward to seeing my little sister,” said Patton. “She just started kindergarten and misses me a lot. She is excited to tell me about what she has been learning in school.” Both Conner and Patton are incredibly thankful for Operation Home for the Holidays, and look forward to seeing their families this holiday season.",
