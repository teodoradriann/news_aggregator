    "text": "The Guardian ‘If Jesus was born today, he’d be born under the rubble’: Bethlehem set for forlorn Christmas Read full article Bethan McKernan and Sufian Taha in Bethlehem 24 December 2023 at 7:00 am · 6-min read Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images\nAt Bethlehem’s Lutheran Evangelical church, the nativity scene looks very different this Christmas. Instead of a cot in a hay-filled manger, the baby doll has been wrapped in the famous black and white keffiyeh associated with Palestine, and lies among broken breeze blocks and paving slabs.\nChristmas celebrations have been cancelled across the Holy Land this year as the region mourns the Palestinians – now more than 20,000, according to Hamas – killed in the Gaza Strip. Munther Isaac, the pastor of the Lutheran church, said he wanted to send the world a message with this year’s nativity scene. “This is the reality of Christmas for Palestinian children,” he said. “If Jesus was born today, he’d be born under the rubble of Gaza.”\nBethlehem, 10 miles south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, is one of the most important centres of Christianity; the Church of the Nativity, today shared by several sects, was built by Emperor Justinian 1,500 years ago above the grotto where it is believed Christ was born.\nToday, the majority of Bethlehem’s population is Muslim but the town is still home to a thriving Christian community and many Christian orders, and the area relies heavily on the tourism and pilgrimage sector. Around 70% of the Bethlehem economy depends on international visitors, said the mayor, Hana Haniyeh.\n“This period is usually very active. We get 1.5 - 2 million visitors a year, but now we have zero,” he said. “Israel has made it very difficult to get here through the checkpoints and our economy has crashed, but we could not celebrate anyway. We are in mourning for the people of Gaza.”\nSince the occupied Palestinian territories do not have an airport, most international visitors enter through Israel, crossing checkpoints in its West Bank barrier wall that keeps the two holy cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem separate from one another, despite the fact that they’re only six miles (10km) apart.\nManger Square in the heart of Bethlehem, outside the Church of the Nativity, is usually thronged with tourists in December. There are festive lights, a giant Christmas tree, and the town’s alleyways and restaurants are filled with music. This year though, Manger Square is grey and empty. No one the Observer spoke to in Bethlehem on Friday could recall a time that there was no traditional tree. Outside the Bethlehem Peace Center, a banner said in Arabic and English: “Stop the genocide, stop the displacement, lift the blockade”.\nStory continues The busy December programme includes hosting international delegations and performances from artists and singers before the festivities culminate with a parade and midnight mass on Christmas Eve. But attendance is expected to be so low this year that the Franciscan order that assigns tickets and deals with security for the event has scrapped the usual protocols; instead, the prayer service will be open to anyone who can make it.\nInteractive Weathering the pandemic was a challenge, but last year Bethlehem’s 5,000 hotel rooms were once again fully booked over Christmas, and were set to do good business again in 2023 before the war broke out.\n“I would get 50 tour groups a month in my shop. All the hotels were reserved again this year and we expected it to be great but that dream was shattered because of the conflict. Everyone cancelled,” said Nabil Giacaman, a third-generation woodworker, and owner of the Il Bambino arts and sculpture shop. His was the only shop open on Friday; he said he had come by just to keep himself busy.\n“I have 12 employees but I don’t think I can pay them at the end of the month,” he said. “We desperately need the tourists.”\nMillions of pilgrims usually visit every year, but very few Christians live in the Holy Land. A century ago, they made up a quarter of Jerusalem’s population but now represent less than 2%. The community struggles to afford housing, and the West Bank security wall has isolated them from their brethren in Jerusalem.\nToday there are just 182,000 Christians in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and 1,300 in Gaza, according to US state department estimates. When the Islamist group Hamas seized control of the strip in 2007 , 3,000 Christians were registered as living there. In the besieged territory, the already tiny Christian community has been decimated by the new war, sparked by the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas that killed 1,140 people.\nThe Catholic Holy Family church in Gaza City has become a makeshift shelter but has been repeatedly hit by Israeli airstrikes. Last week, the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had placed the church under siege, and snipers shot and killed two Christian women , a mother and daughter, who had ventured outside for food and water. Pope Francis condemned the attack, which the IDF denied knowledge of.\nThe Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, Layla Moran, has said she worries that her family members and the other 300 people trapped at the church will not survive until Christmas.\nIn Jerusalem, too, Christmas festivities were cancelled by heads of the major churches. The ancient passageways of the Old City, normally full of tourists and pilgrims throughout the year, have been quiet since October. Most shops and restaurants are closed, with business owners saying they are too scared to come to work.\nIsraeli settlers in the Old City – like the rest of East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1980 – have used the chaos of the war to their advantage. There have been attempts by Israeli developers to seize land in the Armenian quarter that belongs to both the church and individual Armenian Christians; members of the 800-strong community are now camping out 24 hours a day on sites they believe are under threat.\nBoth the Muslim and Christian presence in the Old City and its surroundings were steadily being eroded anyway, owing to efforts by settlers as well as the Israeli government. Over the last few years, the state has accelerated its campaign to demolish increasing numbers of Palestinian homes on the grounds they lack building permits, and displace the community with development projects.\nChristian leaders in Israel and Palestine have been refraining from entering politics or current affairs, but the outpouring of grief and condemnation of the war from the patriarchates this year shows the depth of the anger many of the churches feel.\n“We are sad at seeing all the victims, especially women and children, and we are sad that the international community hasn’t taken serious action to end the massacre, as they did when Russia invaded Ukraine,” said Father Rami Askarieh, the parish priest of Bethlehem’s St Catherine’s church.\n“We pray each day for Gaza and for the victims of the war on both sides,” he said. “Israelis, Palestinians; we are all human, we are all the children of God.”\nTRENDING Ukraine-Russia war – live: Putin issues ‘serious’ warning to west as Kyiv ‘shoots down three bombers’ The Independent · 37-min read Shocking moment Christmas thieves raid alcohol aisle in northwest London Tesco Evening Standard · 2-min read Iran threatens to shut Strait of Gibraltar as tensions ramp up The Telegraph · 4-min read Alison Hammond breaks down in tears over \"lovely\" This Morning present Digital Spy · 2-min read Dad spots children’s stolen Christmas presents on Facebook after police appeal Yahoo News UK · 4-min read",

En simultáneo, rigen alertas en varias provincias por nevadas y vientos fuertes .\nTodo se debe gracias al persistente viento norte, que se registra desde hace días en la zona, y a la ausencia de frentes fríos. “Por lo tanto, se produce un gradual ascenso de temperaturas ”, explicó días atrás Cindy Fernández, vocera del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) , a Infobae .\nDe esta manera, hoy será el día más caluroso, con una máxima que rondará los 27 grados en horas de la tarde en el territorio porteño y el Conurbano bonaerense. Por la noche, los valores térmicos descenderán solo un poco, hasta tocar los 24°C. Durante toda la jornada, el cielo permanecerá nublado .\nLa lluvia llegaría el sábado , que comenzará con 21 grados por la madrugada. Sin embargo, con las lluvias, las temperaturas comenzarán a descender nuevamente. A su vez, se esperan tormentas fuertes durante la mañana y algunas precipitaciones aisladas en horas de la tarde. Al llegar la noche, la lluvia cesará y las temperaturas tocarían los 15 grados.\nLas temperaturas se acercarán a los 30 grados Según el pronóstico del SMN, para el domingo, el termómetro volverá a marcar valores propios de este momento del año, con una mínima cercana a los 9 grados y una máxima de 17. El cielo permanecerá parcialmente nublado durante todo el día y no se pronostican lluvias.\nMás hacia el norte del país, los valores térmicos esperados para hoy son aún más elevados. Por ejemplo, en Chaco se prevén que las máximas alcancen los 38 grados , mientras que en otras provincias como Salta y Santiago del Estero el termómetro alcanzará los 35 grados. En Córdoba y Santa Fe se esperan también temperaturas por encima de los 30°C.\nLas alertas que rigen en el país En simultáneo a las altas temperaturas, 16 provincias se encuentran bajo alerta para este viernes por nevadas, vientos fuertes, lluvias y viento zonda.\nEn ese sentido, el SMN emitió una advertencia de nivel amarillo por fuertes ráfagas de viento que afectarán durante toda la jornada a las provincias de Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa , Corrientes , casi todo el territorio de Santa Fe y el centro norte de Entre Ríos . En esta región, los vientos del sector norte alcanzarán una velocidad de entre 30 y 50 km/h, mientras que las ráfagas serán de 65 km/h.\nA su vez, rige la misma alerta para la zona cordillerana de Jujuy , Salta, Catamarca , La Rioja , San Juan y Neuquén . Aquí se esperan vientos del noroeste con velocidades de entre 40 y 60 km/h y ráfagas que pueden llegar a alcanzar los 110 km/h; sobre todo, en los niveles más altos. Incluso, podría experimentarse una reducción de la visibilidad por viento blanco.\nEl mapa de alertas para este viernes 2 de agosto Sin embargo, el centro de Catamarca, La Rioja, San Juan y gran parte de Mendoza se verán afectadas por el viento zona.\nMás allá de los fuertes vientos, el SMN emitió una alerta amarilla por lluvias en el norte de Neuquén y gran parte de la provincia de Santa Cruz. De igual forma, la advertencia se mantendrá hasta la mañana de hoy.\nPor último, se esperan nevadas de consideración en la región cordillerana de San Juan, Mendoza, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut y Santa Cruz . Pese a que en estas zonas el nivel de advertencia es amarillo, la situación sería aún peor en el centro sur de Mendoza y centro Norte del territorio neuquino, donde rige una alerta naranja por nevadas.\nLa única advertencia que se mantendrá activa el sábado será la alerta por nevadas en el sur del territorio mendocino, pero la situación podría cambiar con el correr de las horas.",

    "text": "25/07/2024 - 17:50\nA Red Bull está tomando medidas drásticas para voltar a ganhar na Fórmula 1. Antes do GP da Bélgica, que ocorre neste domingo, a equipe austríaca proibiu Max Verstappen de jogar simuladores de corrida virtuais nas madrugadas que antecedem as etapas da modalidade.\nO piloto holandês é conhecido por sua paixão por videogames e, no último final de semana, participou de uma corrida virtual horas antes de entrar em seu monoposto e disputar o GP da Hungria. O nervosismo e a irritação de Verstappen durante a prova chamaram atenção e o tricampeão foi alvo de inúmeras críticas.\nCom o segundo carro mais rápido do grid, o holandês acabou se acidentando ao forçar uma ultrapassagem no britânico Lewis Hamilton e teve de se contentar com um quinto lugar. Para Helmut Marko, conselheiro da Red Bull, os videogames podem explicar o rendimento ruim de Max.\n“Max estava muito irritado neste fim de semana e não demorou muito para que as críticas surgissem. Não é uma surpresa, afinal, ele joga corridas online durante boa parte da noite”, afirmou o ex-piloto austríaco em sua coluna no site “Speed Week”.\nEm seu texto, o conselheiro relembrou que Verstappen também jogou o simulador de corrida em Ímola até tarde da noite, mas que o holandês venceu o GP na ocasião. “Ele só participou da corrida online na Hungria porque um piloto de sua equipe virtual não estava disponível. No entanto, combinamos que ele não vai mais jogar videogames até tarde.”\nPara o GP da Bélgica, o piloto holandês deve trocar o motor de combustão interna do seu carro e ser penalizado com a perda de algumas posições. Nas últimas etapas, a Red Bull viu a McLaren crescer de rendimento e ameaçar a liderança do Campeonato de Construtores. Além de terem o carro mais rápido, a equipe inglesa também faz boas pontuações com ambos os carros, algo que não ocorre na equipe da bebida energética.\nNo time austríaco, o mexicano Sergio Pérez está em péssima fase e Verstappen têm sido a única fonte confiável de pontos na atual temporada. Com 265 pontos, o tricampeão está confortável em primeiro lugar no Campeonato de Pilotos. Na disputa entre as escuderias, a Red Bull tem 389 pontos contra 338 da McLaren.\nO final de semana do GP da Bélgica começa nesta sexta-feira, dia 26, às 8h30. No sábado, dia 27, a classificação acontece às 11h. E, por fim, a corrida começa às 10h deste domingo, dia 28.",

    "text": "El nivel del Mediterráneo aumenta en las costas tres veces más rápido de lo previsto Roma.- El nivel del mar Mediterráneo está subiendo en la costa tres veces más rápido de lo previsto “y a finales de siglo pondrá en peligro las actividades humanas y las infraestructuras”, según un informe publicado hoy por el Instituto Nacional de Geofísica y Vulcanología italiano (INGV) El informe, en el que también ha colaborado el Radboud Radio Lab del Departamento de Astrofísica de la Universidad de Radboud (Países Bajos), explica que las proyecciones actuales de aumento del nivel del mar, publicadas en 2021 por el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Ipcc) están “subestimadas a lo largo de las costas”. “La subsidencia, es decir, el lento movimiento descendente del suelo debido a causas naturales o antropogénicas, desempeña un papel crucial en la aceleración de la subida del nivel del mar a lo largo de las costas, desencadenada por el calentamiento global desde 1880”, explica Marco Anzidei, investigador del INGV en una nota. “Nuestros análisis muestran que, precisamente debido al hundimiento, en algunas zonas del Mediterráneo el nivel del mar está aumentando casi tres veces más rápido que en zonas estables “, añade Antonio Vecchio, investigador de la Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen y primer autor del estudio. A la luz de estas evidencias, el equipo de investigadores recalculó las proyecciones del IPCC hasta 2150 en 265 zonas del Mediterráneo, correspondientes también a los 51 mareógrafos de las redes internacionales de vigilancia, incluyendo en los análisis datos relativos al hundimiento. “Los resultados muestran diferencias máximas y mínimas con respecto al informe del IPCC que oscilan, respectivamente, entre aproximadamente más 109 cm y menos 77 cm, con un valor medio superior en aproximadamente 8 cm ”, explica Vecchio. Se explica que, según estos datos, “aproximadamente 38.500 km2 de costas mediterráneas – de los cuales aproximadamente 19.000 km2 sólo en el sector norte de la cuenca – pronto estarán más expuestas al riesgo de inundaciones marinas, con los consiguientes mayores impactos sobre el medio ambiente, actividades humanas e infraestructuras”. “Por lo tanto, es necesario tomar medidas concretas para apoyar a las poblaciones costeras, que serán cada vez más vulnerables al aumento del nivel del mar y a los mayores riesgos asociados a él a finales de este siglo y en el futuro” , concluye el informe.

    "text": "A handout picture by Venezuela's government shows President Nicolas Maduro (C) delivering a speech in Caracas before members of the country's armed forces on December 28, 2023 - Copyright Venezuelan Presidency/AFP Zurimar Campos Javier TOVAR, Esteban ROJAS Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday ordered more than 5,600 military personnel to participate in a “defensive” exercise near the border with Guyana, in response to Britain sending a warship to the area.\nMaduro said he was launching “a joint action of a defensive nature in response to the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against peace and the sovereignty of our country.”\nBritain said Sunday it would divert the patrol vessel HMS Trent to Guyana, a former British colony, amid the South American country’s simmering territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela over the oil-rich Essequibo region.\nA Guyana foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that the ship was due to arrive Friday and would be in its territory for “less than a week” for open sea defense exercises. The ship will not dock in Georgetown.\nThe television broadcast accompanying Maduro’s announcement showed fighter jets participating in the Venezuelan exercise, as well as ships and ocean patrol vessels.\nThe Venezuelan government earlier asked Guyana, in a statement, “to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the HMS Trent, and to refrain from involving military powers in the territorial controversy.”\nGuyana’s vice president Bharrat Jagdeo said the country was not doing anything to threaten Venezuela.\n“A lot of these measures were long-planned and they are routine and they are part of our building a defensive capability,” he told a press conference.\n“We don’t plan on invading Venezuela. President Maduro knows this and he need not have any worry about that.”\n– ‘We are warriors’ –\nMaduro claims that Essequibo — which makes up about two-thirds of Guyana’s territory — is actually Venezuelan land, a decades-old contention that has flared since massive oil deposits were found in its waters.\nThe rising tensions have raised fears in the region of a potential conflict over the remote area of 160,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles).\nThe South American neighbors agreed earlier this month not to resort to force to settle the dispute, during a meeting between Maduro and Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali.\n“We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue, in peace,” said Maduro.\n“But no one should threaten Venezuela, no one should mess with Venezuela. We are a people of peace, but we are warriors and this threat is unacceptable for any sovereign country,” he said.\n“The threat of the decadent, rotten, ex-empire of the United Kingdom is unacceptable.”\nA UK foreign minister, David Rutley, visited Guyana earlier this month and reiterated sovereign borders “must be respected” and that London would work internationally “to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld.”\nMaduro’s government held a controversial referendum on December 3 in which 95 percent of voters, according to officials in the hard-line leftist government, supported declaring Venezuela the rightful owner of Essequibo.\nHe has since started legal maneuvers to create a Venezuelan province in Essequibo and ordered the state oil company to issue licenses for extracting crude in the region.\nGuyana’s Ali has branded the moves a “grave threat to international peace and security.”",

    "title": "St. Francis Honoured by a Simple Man (1300) by Giotto",
    "text": "The artwork titled “St. Francis Honoured by a Simple Man” was created by Giotto in the year 1300. This fresco, a significant work from the Proto Renaissance art movement, measures 270 x 230 cm. It belongs to the series “Legend of St Francis” and is classified under the genre of religious painting. The masterpiece is currently housed in the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, located in Assisi, Italy.\nThe artwork depicts St. Francis being honored by a humble individual, highlighting the virtue of humility associated with the saint. The composition features architectural elements reminiscent of classical structures, situating the scene in a serene and reverent setting. The saint is distinguished by his halo, which signifies his sanctity, and he is surrounded by figures dressed in contemporary attire, enhancing the narrative’s accessibility. Rich in detail and imbued with a sense of piety, this fresco is an exemplary piece of Giotto’s innovative approach to capturing human emotion and spirituality.",
