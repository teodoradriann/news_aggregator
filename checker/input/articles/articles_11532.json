    "text": "‘I discovered DALL-E and was blown away’: How artists are using AI to create very offline art Sage Lazzaro April 11, 2024 at 10:23 PM Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nHello and welcome to Eye on AI.\nIn recent issues, I’ve covered why artists and creatives are pushing back on generative AI. In short, they worry about their work being used to train these models without consent, their work being devalued, and fewer opportunities for human creatives in a world where AI can be faster and cheaper. But even the more than 200 prominent musical artists who last week signed an open letter laying out such concerns emphasized they believe that “when used responsibly, AI has enormous potential to enhance creativity.”\nWe’re still very much in the early days of these issues and generative AI overall, and there are no easy answers for how to balance all this just yet. But as it’s unfolding, some artists are experimenting with how they can use generative AI as a tool to enhance, not hinder, their creative work.\nOne such artist is Sydney Swisher, an Illinois-based painter and photographer. I’ve been following Swisher for a while. Her unique works involve painting on fabric, immersing a scene—a quaint windowsill, a dresser adorned with jewelry and photos, a dreamy bedroom—into the pattern (usually floral) on a piece of fabric, bringing them together as one. The result is always beautiful, textured, and dimensional, and the whole thing feels incredibly offline. So I was shocked to learn that in between thrifting old fabrics and brushing on paint, Sydney uses generative AI to help bring her visions to life.\nAfter choosing a fabric to serve as the base for the painting, Swisher selects photos she’s taken to use as reference images, brings them into Midjourney, and adds prompt descriptions to describe a memory she has that the fabric seems to invoke. She then tweaks the prompts, adds more reference images, and plays with how the images and fabric can interact. After selecting one image Midjourney produced, she further edits it in Photoshop to get it closer to the specific memory she’s channeling in order to create a final reference image she’ll paint.\n“I discovered DALL-E and was blown away by its ability to craft a scene I had in my mind. I found Midjourney around April of last year and was amazed at the quality of images and ability to edit specific details,” she told me, adding that the quality of Midjourney images won her over and that she also loves being able to feed it her own reference images, including old film photos from her childhood.\nA large part of her art, Swisher said in a TikTok video describing her process, is based around machine intelligence visually interpreting descriptions of memories.\n“I want my work to be a reflection on memory. I have very vague visual references in my mind of places that evoke strong nostalgia and emotion,” she said. “I'm interested in the exploration of trying to fully bring that time back.\nShe continued: “When you focus on trying to pinpoint every detail of a memory, pieces will always be blurry and you begin to question yourself. What parts are accurate? Did I dream that, or did it really happen? The first time I saw a generated image from DALL-E, I felt like it perfectly captured this feeling. To me, it truly looked like a still from a memory or a dream.”\nIn another example of creatives trying to play nice with generative AI, filmmaker Paul Trillo spoke on the Hard Fork podcast about his experience previewing Sora, OpenAI’s new text-to-video model that recently sent both Hollywood executives and much of the general public into a panic. Trillo’s account is one of the first hands-on reviews of Sora, and he describes how he tried to test what the model could do and found it had its own sense of editing and pacing.\n“I was shocked. I was floored. I was confused. I was a little bit unsettled because I was, damn, this is doing things that I didn’t know it was capable of,” he said when asked what his initial emotional response was the first time he typed in a prompt and got a video.\nTrillo said the video he created in days with Sora would’ve taken months with traditional tools—and also that the model “can give us some experimental wild, bold weird things that may be difficult to achieve with other tools.” Still, he thinks the model is only supplemental to human video production. Similar to Swisher, he views it as a new part of the process he can use to achieve his vision.\n“I’m only going to focus on this tool to get everything out of my head,” Trillo said.\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news.\nSage Lazzaro\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\nsagelazzaro.com\nToday's edition of Eye on AI was curated by Sharon Goldman.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The average temperature in July was 2.16 C higher than the overall monthly average recorded between 1991 and 2020, with the mercury rising above 40 C in seven locations on some days during the month, the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Thursday. So far this year the country has recorded 3,509 instances of \"extreme heat\" of 35 C or higher among the 914 nationwide observation points, surpassing the previous peak of 3,127 seen in July 2018. According to the agency, the country was hit by warm air due to the effects of a high-pressure system in the Pacific, experiencing sweltering temperatures particularly in early July and toward the end of the month. On July 29, Sano, Tochigi Prefecture logged 41.0 C, as a number of locations throughout the country topped previous record highs. In August 2020, the mercury hit a record high of 41.1 in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, tying the all-time high logged in July 2018 in Kumagaya, Saitama Prefecture. With the heat expected to continue in August, the public has been urged to take measures to prevent heat exhaustion such as using air conditioning and staying hydrated.",

Se trata de Caleb Adams de 46 años de edad quien compartió su historia mientras todavía sigue recuperándose de las heridas que esto le dejó.\nExclusive: A San Diego swimmer who was recently attacked by a shark shares his story with @GadiNBC , including details of his interaction with the animal and how people around him helped. pic.twitter.com/IXkfyQiTgt\n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 18, 2024\nAdams y sus amigos nadaban en aguas abiertas, el domingo 2 de junio, cuando el día de pronto dio un giro de 180 grados. Describe “un dolor o aplastamiento” en donde asegura haber forcejado con el tiburón durante unos segundos.\nAdams indicó que la lucha se volvió intensa e intentó utilizar sus manos para rechazar al animal, colocando sus manos en la boca o nariz, pero se sentía como sujetar una pelota de basketball.\nEl hombre fue trasladado de inmediato al hospital más cercano.\nPese a este caso, los expertos insisten en que los ataques de tiburones siguen siendo raros. (Getty)\nUn biólogo marino expresó que es importante que el mundo sepa que las mordeduras de tiburón son muy raras. Se podría hablar de estadísticas y compararlas con otras cosas como las máquinas expendedoras que caen sobre la gente.\nFinalmente Adams asegura estar curándose y planea apoyarse en la comunidad local, a la cual agradeció por su apoyo y preocupación durante este tiempo.\nTAMBIÉN TE PUEDE INTERESAR | EN VIDEO\nUn enorme tiburón mako salta fuera del agua mientras persigue un cebo",

    "text": "Crisis en el Ministerio Público: ¿Quién es el hombre que debilita al equipo Lava Jato desde adentro y está vinculado al fujimorismo?\nJuan Antonio Fernández Jerí ha sido el responsable de suspender a los fiscales José Domingo Pérez y Rafael Vela del Equipo Especial Lava Jato. La cuestionada autoridad pública tendría vínculos con Fuerza Popular y el APRA.\nLa gestión de Juan Antonio Fernández Jerí al frente de la Autoridad Nacional de Control (ANC) del Ministerio Público\nha estado envuelta en múltiples controversias y cuestionamientos que ponen en entredicho su idoneidad para el cargo. Designado el 6 de septiembre de 2022 por la Junta Nacional de Justicia (JNJ), su nombramiento generó dudas debido a antecedentes previos y acciones posteriores que han sido cuestionadas, como la reciente suspensión a Juan Domingo Pérez de su cargo de fiscal por el Equipo Especial Lava Jato.\nUn audio que revela una conversación entre Fernández Jerí con el abogado de Fuerza Popular, Christian Salas, y el testimonio del exasesor Jaime Villanueva, el cual indica que el jefe de la ANC se habría reunido con el exministro aprista Hernán Garrido Lecca para pedir la destitución de los fiscales Lava Jato, ponen en evidencia los vínculos políticos y de favoritismos que tendría Juan Fernández con los partidos Fuerza Popular y el Partido Aprista Peruano (APRA).\nPUEDES VER:\n[Congreso: Comisión de Constitución aprueba proyecto fujimorista para suspender a fiscales, jueces, ministros y miembros de la JNJ]\nAcusaciones previas a su designación\nAntes de asumir la jefatura de la ANC, en 2014, Fernández Jerí fue señalado por Yanet Guerrero Mego de haber negociado la liberación de su padre a cambio de 80.000 soles. Esta grave acusación fue archivada en 2017 por el exfiscal supremo Víctor Rodríguez Monteza sin considerar el testimonio de la principal testigo, lo que provocó críticas sobre la transparencia del proceso.\nPosteriormente, se conoció que dicho proceso había sido archivado sin notificación previa a la Procuraduría Anticorrupción. La sospechosa omisión de Rodríguez, permitió que Fernández Jerí pueda alegar ser absuelto y que nadie apele, indicando que se trataría de una decisión \"consentida\".\nSin embargo, el caso se volvió polémico cuando Víctor Rodríguez Montaza fue destituido como fiscal supremo por la JNJ el 24 de noviembre de 2021 por haber tenido vínculos con la organización criminal Los Cuellos Blancos del Puerto. Esto ocasionó que el nombramiento de Fernando Jerí en la ANC quede suspendida en abril de 2022; pero en septiembre del mismo año se concretó su inicio en el órgano del Ministerio Público.\nReuniones con autoridades investigadas\nDurante su gestión, Fernández Jerí admitió haberse reunido en 2022 y 2023 con diversas autoridades políticas, incluyendo ministros y congresistas que estaban bajo investigación por delitos de corrupción. Entre ellos se encuentran José Luna Gálvez, investigado por presuntos delitos de cohecho activo, organización criminal y lavado de activos; María Acuña Peralta, investigada por presunto delito de concusión; Miguel Ciccia Vásquez (Renovación Popular), investigado por presuntos patrocinio ilegal y tráfico de influencias y Martha Moyano, congresista fujimorista del actual parlamento.\nAunque Fernández Jerí argumentó que estos encuentros tenían como finalidad gestionar recursos para la ANC, la JNJ inició una investigación preliminar por posible inconducta funcional\n.\nAdicional a dichas reuniones oficiales, surgieron los testimonios del exasesor Jaime Villanueva, que señalaron que Fernández Jerí habría coordinado con la entonces fiscal de la Nación, Patricia Benavides, y con figuras políticas como el exministro aprista Hernán Garrido Lecca y el abogado José Luis Hauyón, para facilitar la suspensión de fiscales como Rafael Vela y José Domingo Pérez (ambos del Equipo Especial Lava Jato).\nEn su declaración, Villanueva reveló que Fernández Jerí inició los procesos disciplinarios contra los fiscales, sacando nuevamente a la luz viejas denuncias de fujimoristas contra Vela y Domingo. “Fernández Jerí no iba a parar hasta suspenderlo (a Vela)”, y le recomendó que “mejor sería que busque defensa legal”, pues, “detrás del jefe de la ANC-MPFN tendrían sus intereses Hernán Garrido-Lecca y José Luis Hauyón, ya que dicho jefe de la ANC-MPFN había sido nombrado con ayuda de ellos y les debía ese favor”, contó el exasesor.\nSuspensión de fiscales Rafael Vela y José Domingo Pérez\nLa ANC, bajo la dirección de Fernández Jerí, ha tomado decisiones polémicas respecto a fiscales emblemáticos en la lucha anticorrupción. La primera fue en noviembre de 2023, cuando se suspendió por más de ocho meses al fiscal Rafael Vela, coordinador del Equipo Especial Lava Jato, por comentarios críticos hacia una decisión judicial.\nRecientemente, en abril de 2025, se ha suspendido por seis meses al fiscal José Domingo Pérez por presuntas faltas administrativas. Estas acciones han sido interpretadas por diversos sectores como intentos para debilitar las investigaciones de corrupción, como el Caso Cocteles contra Keiko Fujimori.\nTras su suspensión, José Domingo Pérez denunció a Fernández Jerí por el presunto delito de cohecho pasivo, basándose en el audio que revela una supuesta conversación entre Fernández Jerí y Christian Salas Beteta, abogado de Fuerza Popular, en la que se habría discutido su destitución del cargo.\nEl fiscal Pérez asegura que el Ministerio Público se negó a recibir la grabación durante meses y recientemente, hace unos días, pasó a una oficina para su investigación. Por su parte, la ANC ha negado tales reuniones y cualquier complot contra fiscales.",
