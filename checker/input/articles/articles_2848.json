Together, Fahmi said, each school can raise students' and citizens' awareness of the importance of humanity and global justice and provide tangible support to the struggling Palestinian people, as mandated in the 1945 Constitution's preamble and the implementation of Pancasila's second precept, Fair and Civilized Humanity, as well as participating in maintaining world peace. “Be part of this movement and show that Indonesia's young generation cares and is ready to stand up against injustice with the hashtag #alleyesonrafah. Let's realize our real action on Friday, May 31, 2024, a full day together with the struggle of the Palestinian people,” Fahmi Zulkarnain exclaimed. Please note that until Friday (31/05) morning, there are already 420 Integrated Islamic Schools spread from Aceh to Papua and will simultaneously participate in Solidarity Action for Palestine in each school. The estimated number of participants in the action reached tens of thousands spread over several regions.

    "text": "Exclusivo\n[Actualidad]\nAguacero en Guayaquil y sus estragos en habitantes: \"Cada invierno es un infierno\"\nEl caos vehicular fue una de las principales consecuencias de la lluvia. Muchos llegaron tarde a sus ‘camellos’ debido al colapso del tráfico\nMartha Carranza se levantó temprano, como todos los días. A las 06:00 ya estaba en pie, preparándose para salir de su casa en el sector de Sauces 6 y subirse al automóvil de su esposo, quien la lleva hasta su lugar de trabajo, en el centro de Guayaquil.\n(Te invitamos a leer: Allanamientos en urbanización de La Aurora: detenidos y miles de dólares incautados)\nSin embargo, la adversa condición climática de la mañana de ayer le jugó una mala pasada. Eran casi las 09:00 cuando finalmente comenzaba su trayecto al ‘camello’ y, como suele ocurrir en su zona, la inundación la sorprendió. El agua, que alcanzaba casi las rodillas, ya había ingresado en varias viviendas, dañando electrodomésticos y enseres.\n“Pensábamos que la lluvia disminuiría pero, en cambio, se intensificaba con el paso de los minutos. Nos daba miedo salir y que nuestras pertenencias se mojaran. Antes de irme, le pedí a mi esposo que pusiera una tranca en la puerta para evitar que el agua ingresara. Esto pasa todos los años. El invierno es una pesadilla para quienes vivimos en este sector de Sauces”, relató la señora con visible preocupación.\nSu esposo, quien la transportaba, también expresó su frustración ante la situación recurrente que enfrentan cada invierno. Aseguró que el problema no radica en las mareas altas, sino en la inadecuada evacuación del agua en la zona.\n“No sabemos si el problema es culpa de las alcantarillas. Un día, un funcionario del Municipio nos comentó que era nuestra responsabilidad, pues los ciudadanos arrojamos desechos en las calles y eso tapa las alcantarillas. Pero no creemos que sea así. Este año, junto con los vecinos, limpiamos las calles antes de la temporada de lluvias. Ya es hora de que las autoridades tomen cartas en el asunto, no solo en nuestro sector”, agregó con indignación el morador.\nLa fuerte lluvia que azotó gran parte de Guayaquil desde las 18:00 del martes no solo afectó a quienes viven en zonas propensas a inundaciones, sino también a muchos que llegaron tarde a sus trabajos, debido al caos vehicular generado por las calles anegadas, semáforos dañados y carros dañados.\nEntre los lugares más afectados, según información de Segura EP, estuvieron las avenidas 25 de Julio, Domingo Comín, Benjamín Carrión, del Bombero, Barcelona, además de sectores como Sauces, Alborada y partes del centro porteño.\nEn la vía a Daule se registró un denso tráfico vehicular; mientras que en la avenida Isidro Ayora, un automóvil perdió el control y se estrelló contra varias palmeras y un poste de alumbrado público.

    "text": "Álvaro Sáez: \"Ser caritativos es cumplir con la misión que nos mandó Jesús hace dos mil años\" Álvaro Saez reflexiona sobre la importancia de la caridad en la sociedad cristiana, la cual celebramos el próximo domingo: \"Ser caritativos no debería ser un motivo para medallas\" Tiempo de lectura: 2' Actualizado 02:04 Qué la Iglesia está por todo el mundo no es novedad. Que ejerce una labor importante con los que más lo necesitan, tampoco. Sin embargo, esta semana hemos ido recibiendo, a la espera de conocer el informe a nivel nacional, las distintas memorias de actividades de Cáritas diocesanas. No siendo algo nuevo, sí que es noticia, además interesante. ¿Por qué? Porque nos muestra y nos ejemplifica, precisamente, cómo la Iglesia es un agente fundamental en la sociedad. Un agente necesario. Para todas las personas, no solo para los creyentes. La Iglesia está con la gente, entiende a la gente. Es capaz de analizar y detectar sus problemas. Se da cuenta de que la pobreza se ha convertido en algo estructural en nuestro país. Sabe donde están los fallos y cómo es importante seguir poniendo al ser humano en el centro. Ahora bien, y esto es importante recordarlo. La Iglesia es solo asistencialista. La Iglesia no es una ONG. Ya nos lleva mucho tiempo alertando Francisco sobre esto... La Iglesia está donde están todos. También con el que más lo necesita. Pero le propone un modo de vida, cambia el paradigma con el que se trata y se mira a los más desfavorecidos.Y por eso, en la solemnidad del Corpus del Domingo, celebramos también el día de la Caridad. Pero la caridad bien entendida...Una caridad que, sí, que sale al encuentro y anuncia el Evangelio.Que ayuda y levanta al pobre... pero que también le dice que Dios le ama.Que detecta injusticias. Actúa sobre ellas. Y le dice que Jesús murió injustamente por él.Que en mitad de cualquier miseria siempre ha esperanza. Siempre.Y que, como nos cuenta Eva San martín, la coordinadora de la campaña de caridad de Cáritas Española, siempre podemos recalcular la ruta. Una ruta que nos debe guiar a Dios. Y la caridad es eso. La caridad no es compansión. La caridad no es una actitud solidaria con el sufrimiento ajeno. La caridad lleva necesariamente consigo el amor y la esperanza. Es ser misionero, y nosotros como bautizados tenemos esa misión. Ser caritativos no debería ser un motivo para ponernos una medalla. Ser caritativos es cumplir con nuestra misión que nos mandó Jesús hace 2 mil años. Id al mundo entero y llevar la buena noticia - item no encontrado",
