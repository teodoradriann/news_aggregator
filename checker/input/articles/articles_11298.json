    "text": "No cayeron para nada bien las declaraciones hechas recientemente por el alto comisionado de paz, Otty Patiño, quien sugirió cerrar la Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz (JEP). Este jueves, el presidente de ese tribunal, Roberto Carlos Vidal, señaló las consecuencias para el país si prospera la propuesta que fue puesta sobre la mesa por parte de Patiño.Entre estas, se encontraría una sanción por parte de la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) en contra de Colombia, puesto que se habría omitido el cumplimiento de uno de los compromisos adquiridos para investigar a fondo los hechos del conflicto armado interno.“La declaración que produce esta reacción nuestra nos hace temer que el Estado colombiano pudiera incurrir en incumplimiento de sus obligaciones internacionales, lo cual podría tener un efecto muy negativo para el Estado”, explicó el magistrado Vidal.Para ello, planteó un escenario “de cara a que podrían volver a abrirse mecanismos como el examen preliminar –ojalá nunca suceda– o que la Corte Penal Internacional tuviera que asumir sus obligaciones en la falta del cumplimiento del Estado colombiano ”.En rueda de prensa, el magistrado Vidal reseñó que las funciones de la JEP de investigar, juzgar y sancionar hechos registrados durante el conflicto armado se verían afectadas por la decisión de cerrar anticipadamente ese “tribunal” que tiene ocho de existencia.“En ese sentido, la JEP tiene una función clave a futuro en lo que tiene que ver con la estabilización, la seguridad jurídica, la protección de los derechos de las víctimas, la reconciliación y el cumplimiento del Acuerdo Final de Paz”, aseguró el presidente del tribunal creado tras la firma del Acuerdo de Paz entre el Gobierno y la guerrilla de las Farc.“La JEP también alerta sobre la posición que puede tomar la Corte Penal Internacional frente a cualquier decisión que apunte a cerrar la JEP antes de tiempo o que impida el desarrollo de sus funciones, o restrinja los recursos para su operación. Esto puede ser visto por la CPI como un incumplimiento de las obligaciones del Estado en materia de juzgar crímenes internacionales. Teniendo en cuenta que, a raíz del trabajo de la JEP, la CPI decidió levantar el examen preliminar sobre Colombia en materia de investigar crímenes de guerra y de lesa humanidad”, señaló el magistrado.Igualmente, aprovechó la oportunidad para llamar la atención del Gobierno Petro por la falta de cumplimiento en sus obligaciones en materia de Presupuesto, con el componente restaurativo del Acuerdo Final de Paz.Esto después de conocer que el presupuesto del Fondo Colombia en Paz fue reasignado. “Este dinero estaba destinado a la implementación de la imposición de sanciones, a través de las que los comparecientes deberán cumplir con sus sentencias para restaurar el daño causado a las víctimas y a sus comunidades. Esto puede llevar a un escenario en el que la JEP emita sentencias y no existan recursos para ejecutarlas”.Parte del presupuesto de 450 mil millones de pesos habría sido reasignado pese a que este dinero estaba destinado a la implementación de la imposición de sanciones a través de las que los comparecientes deberán cumplir con sus sentencias para restaurar el daño causado a las víctimas y a sus comunidades.",

    "text": "Travis Head hits 154 as England fall to seven-wicket defeat in ODI series opener against rivals Australia Published 19/09/2024 at 19:39 GMT Australia won the first match of their five-game ODI series against old rivals England by seven wickets. Travis Head hit an unbeaten 154 at Trent Bridge as Australia put on a sensational showing with the bat. Fast bowler Jofra Archer returned to ODI action, but it was not enough to inspire England to victory. The second match of the series gets under way on Saturday at Headingley. Travis Head hit a brilliant unbeaten 154 as England fell to a seven-wicket defeat in the opening match of their ODI series with Australia. Ben Duckett top scored with 95 runs for England, who were captained by Harry Brook, as the tourists were set a target of 315 to win. However, Head was indomitable at the crease, smashing Australia to victory with 36 balls to spare. Head shared an unbroken partnership of 148 with Marnus Labuschagne, who added 77 runs from 61 balls. Stand-in England skipper Brook admits that he was wrong to opt to bat after winning the toss at Trent Bridge. \"It probably went wrong at the toss when I batted first, and it turned out to be a belter,\" [Brook told BBC Test Match Special.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/live/cxr2n052p3qt#LiveReporting)\"A tough night but we move forward. It's a five-game series and four more to go. \"Last night I was thinking about bowling first, then changed my mind 20 minutes before the toss. \"Hindsight is a beautiful thing. You can't think too much into it. \"We probably didn't rotate spin well enough through the middle period. It's something I am working on personally as well. \"There were too many dot balls in the middle period. I felt we were in a good position at the halfway point. \"Under the lights at the end there, it got better, and they could hit through the ball easier.\" The second ODI in the five-match series will get under way on Saturday at Headingley. Jofra Archer was playing his first ODI for England since the 50-run defeat against Bangladesh in March 2023, but went wicketless. Head was named player-of-the-match and admitted Australia's bowlers did well to limit England to 315. \"I got a bit lucky at the start. If you can get through there are a lot of runs on offer, especially here,\" he added. \"It is nice I could contribute. I felt we did an exceptional job to get it to 315 [with the ball]. It felt like it would be a few more. The start was tough. Jof [Jofra Archer] had it moving around corners.\" [discovery+](https://get.discoveryplus.com/gb/watch-tnt-sports-on-discoveryplus?utm_campaign=UK-TNT-D1-TNT-C7-TNT-BAU-DR-W-Cricket-Undefined-240101-NA&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tntsports.co.uk&utm_content=story-content-text-subscribe&vid=81nbs63f13fv0cyy&cid=0ee1b05714eadfd3193bf34fbc4e5980&c=%7B%22875074%22%3A%221089459%22%2C%221086912%22%3A%221348017%22%2C%221286498%22%3A%221595017%22%2C%221286521%22%3A%221595043%22%7D)is the home of every international series played in India, including England's tour in 2025.

    "text": "What Is Injury Legal?\nInjury legal is the branch of law that determines your rights when someone else's actions harm you. It covers everything, from how to seek financial compensation to the circumstances that can trigger an action.\nThe first issue is whether a person owed you a duty of care. If they did, the next question to ask is whether their breach caused injury to you.\nTort law\nTort law is among the most important pillars of the legal system.\ninjury claim norman addresses injuries caused to others by other people. Its goal is to compensate victims and avoid injury by holding responsible parties accountable. Torts may be criminal or civil.\nMost legal systems provide ample protection for the life, limbs, and property of a person. For example, a court will typically award significant damages to the victim of battery or assault for the injury, and punish the person who did the harm with a criminal sanction.\nTo be eligible for a remedy, a harmed event must be certain (prohibiting speculation damages), direct, and cause a legitimate concern. The injury must also be fairly previsible, however exceptions are permitted in cases where the plaintiff could not have reasonably prevented the injury from happening.\nIn some instances there are situations where liability is dependent on strict liability (non-fault) such as that for defective products or abnormally dangerous activities. However, the participants are typically required to sign an indemnity waiver and are warned about the risks of the activity. This is a common defence for a tort claim. For example, a situation one woman who suffered severe brain damage because the company Athena Diagnostics misclassified a mutation in her gene can be defended by the principle of volenti non fit injuria.\nStatute of limitations\nA statute of limitation is a law which sets an upper limit on the time period beginning from the date that an incident took place during which a victim is able to commence legal actions. This permits cases to be settled before they become stale, and no longer proveable. Statutes of limitations are essential to stop injustice, making sure that the memories of witnesses do not fade and that individuals can continue to live their lives.\nThe time limit for filing a claim varies depending on the state and the type of case. In New York, personal injury claims must be filed within three years following the date of the accident or the time the case was discovered. In addition the statute of limitation may be suspended or tolled in certain situations such as cases involving minors, or a wrongful death lawsuit.\nSpeak with a lawyer who is qualified to determine the impact of the statute of limitation on your case. A lawyer can also assist you in understanding the particulars of your case and give you an exact estimate of how long your case could take.\nDamages\nDamages, also referred to as monetary compensation, are meant to assist a victim in recovering from his or her injuries. They may include medical bills as well as loss of income and property damage, as well funeral expenses in cases of death. Typically, the person who was injured must prove that these expenses were directly connected to the injury to be eligible for compensation.\nThe term \"damages\" is used to refer to the damage and losses sustained by a person as a result of the negligence of someone else or an wrongful act. Civil damages are designed to put the person who was injured back to the same position as if she had not been injured by the act of negligence. Damages are categorized as either general or specific. Special damages are able to be listed and include medical expenses as well as lost wages. General damages are less quantifiable, and include things such as suffering and pain, mental distress, and loss in quality of life.\nIn a lot of personal injury cases, the parties responsible and their insurance companies will demand that the injured person undergo an independent medical examination (IME). Learn more about IMEs and what they are and when they are appropriate and how they may impact your case.\nAlternative dispute resolution\nAlternative dispute resolution is a different option to litigation that aims at settling disputes without litigation. It's typically less expensive and more efficient than traditional court procedures. Arbitration and mediation are two instances of alternative dispute settlement.\nIn mediation, a third party neutral is employed to help parties in conflict reach an agreement. The neutral is usually proficient in negotiations and skilled at identifying issues that require to be solved. This method encourages open communication and solving problems.\nSome mediators choose to take a more moderate approach by focusing on shuttle diplomacy while hiding their own opinions. Others adopt a more evaluative approach and use their own knowledge and opinions to guide parties towards an agreement. The most experienced mediators mix these methods according to the situation and the style of the participants.\nMany large corporations employ alternative dispute resolution methods. NCR, which is now AT&T Global Information Solutions, is one of them. When management committed to this policy, NCR's number of filed lawsuits dropped from 263 in 1984 down to 28 in 1993. In addition the outside counsel and internal counsel fees were lower than they would have been for a traditional lawsuit.\nWorking with an attorney\nIf you or someone close to you has been injured in an accident, it's crucial to seek medical attention right away. Additionally, a personal injury attorney will assist you with any financial losses that you've suffered. You can get compensation for medical expenses, loss of income or income, pain and suffering and more. In some cases, you may be able claim damages for wrongful death. Williamson, Clune and Stevens is an experienced New York personal injury law firm. They can provide more advice on your particular case during a private consultation.\nIn many cases, the defendant's insurance company will try to deny your claim, or pay the victim less than they should. Your attorney can make sure that your claim is handled fairly and that you're compensated for the full amount of your losses.\nYou'll need your lawyer present at all stages of the lawsuit, including depositions and other procedures. You should inform your lawyer promptly if your work or personal schedule is disrupted.",

    "title": "Chizuko Ueno's Feminist Ideals Captivate China, Inspiring Both Women and Men",
    "text": "As China grapples with entrenched gender discrimination, Japanese women's studies pioneer Chizuko Ueno emerges as a beacon of inspiration for many, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. With over 700,000 copies of her books sold in mainland China and a significant presence on Douban, China's largest book review platform, Ueno's feminist ideals resonate deeply within Chinese society. Her impact highlights a growing consciousness around gender issues and the feminist movement among Chinese women and men alike, challenging traditional societal roles and advocating for equality.\nBreaking Barriers: Ueno's Influence in China\nIn an era where gender discrimination remains pervasive, Chizuko Ueno's works offer a fresh perspective on feminism, encouraging a dialogue among Chinese women about their societal roles and aspirations. Her popularity soared when her book on misogyny, originally published in 2015, was ranked first in the Douban list of \"Reprint Editions with Honorable Mention\" in 2023, sparking widespread discussion online. This engagement underscores a collective yearning for change and empowerment among women, who navigate the challenges of gender bias in their personal and professional lives.\nCultural Shifts and Feminist Awakening\nThe traction gained by Ueno's feminist ideologies in China is not just limited to women. Men, too, have found solace and insight in her teachings, reflecting on their own positions within a competitive society that often equates strength with success. This broad appeal suggests a cultural shift towards recognizing and addressing gender inequality, influenced by Ueno's candid discussions on the subject. Her works serve as a catalyst for change, inspiring individuals to reevaluate gender norms and advocate for a more equitable society.\nChallenges and the Path Forward\nDespite the growing interest in feminism and gender studies, the path forward remains fraught with challenges. The tightening control of civic groups advocating for women's rights by the Chinese government poses a significant obstacle to the feminist movement. The sustainability of this burgeoning interest, particularly in Ueno's ideals, hinges on the ability of Chinese society to embrace these discussions openly and persistently. As more individuals engage with feminist ideas, there is hope for a future where gender equality is not just an ideal but a lived reality.\nThe widespread resonance of Chizuko Ueno's feminist principles in China underscores a pivotal moment in the fight against gender discrimination. As her ideas continue to inspire and challenge societal norms, the impact of her work offers a glimpse into the potential for transformative change. By fostering a dialogue that transcends cultural boundaries, Ueno's legacy empowers individuals to envision a more equitable world.",
