    "title": "‘I Would Have Told Him, Suck It Up’: Walz’ Decision To Retire Before Deployment Frustrated National Guard Superior",
    "text": "DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION —A former noncommissioned officer who served as Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota’s superior said he would not have allowed him to retire shortly before his National Guard unit was ordered to Iraq, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\nA 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sgt. Major Thomas Behrends accusing Walz of retiring after learning his unit would be deployed to Iraq resurfaced after Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in the upcoming presidential election.\nRetired Army Command Sgt. Maj. Doug Julin, who was the command sergeant major of the brigade Walz was assigned to, said Walz went over his head in arranging his retirement with higher officers before the unit was scheduled to be deployed, The Washington Post reported .\n“I would have analyzed it and challenged him,” Julin told The Washington Post. “It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, ‘Suck it up, we’re going.’”\nJulin previously criticized the Minnesota governor in a Sept. 26, 2022, interview with Alpha News, where he expanded on what took place prior to Walz’s May 2005 retirement, calling it a “backdoor deal.”\n“I’m going forward,” Julin recalled Walz telling him during an early 2005 meeting he and Walz attended where the unit’s deployment to Iraq was discussed, according to Alpha News. “Then out of nowhere in June of 2005, Tom Behrends is there as the new [command sergeant major].”\nJulin said that the sudden retirement caused his fellow soldiers to ask questions.\n“Soldiers are thinking, ‘What does he know that I don’t know?’ That’s the kind of message it sends,” he told Alpha News.\n“When the nation called, he quit,” Behrends and Paul Herr wrote. “He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of. He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.”\nWalz did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation",

    "text": "MONROE, Mich. (WXYZ) — The woman charged in the deadly crash at the Swan Boat Club in Berlin Township on Saturday has been released after posting bond, jail officials confirmed. Bond for Marshella Chidester, 66, was set at $1.5 million. She was given conditions that included not operating a motor vehicle, substance abuse monitoring and a GPS tether. Chidester crashed into the boat club on Saturday afternoon as it was hosting a child's birthday party. VIDEO: Video shows vehicle right before deadly crash at Swan Boat Club According to the sheriff's office, two siblings, 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and 4-year-old Zayn Phillips, were pronounced dead at the scene. Ten other people, including Alanah and Zayn’s mother, were injured in the crash and hospitalized. One of the victims suffered minor injuries and sought treatment on his own. The other nine victims’ conditions varied from minor injuries to critical condition. Chidester was arraigned Tuesday morning on eight charges, including two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of OWI causing death and four counts of OWI causing serious injury. In court Tuesday, the judge [allowed friends and family members of the victims to speak](https://www.wxyz.com/news/driver-accused-in-swan-boat-club-crash-that-killed-2-kids-injured-others-to-be-arraigned-tuesday) and emotions ran high. During the arraignment, the prosecution asked for a $1.5 million bond and said that they have substantial evidence in the case and that the suspect had a substance abuse issue. In arguing against the high bond, Chidester's attorney, Bill Colovos, said that Chidester has never had any traffic citations and that Chidester has a history of having seizures since last November, saying that it was an \"epileptic-type seizure in her legs.\" VIDEO: Hear from the aunt during the arraignment below: The arraignment was interrupted several times on Zoom by people watching. “I had to see my deceased niece and nephew. I had to see their very last moment before her car was removed,” Alanah and Zayn’s aunt Raquel Smothers said. “I had to be the one to tell my sister her babies were gone when they removed her ventilator yesterday. She said 'How am I supposed to live without my babies?'” VIDEO: Hear from the aunt during the arraignment below: Related: ['Very rare': Judge allows loved ones to address alleged boat club drunken driver](https://www.wxyz.com/news/very-rare-judge-allows-loved-ones-to-address-alleged-boat-club-drunken-driver) If you would like to help the family pay for funeral services, you can do so at the verified [GoFundMe link here.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-lana-and-zayns-funeral-services) A [GoFundMe has also been set up](https://www.gofundme.com/f/hit-by-a-drunk-driver-at-swan-boat-club) for one of the victims in the hospital.

    "text": "4月末，西班牙、葡萄牙遭遇大停电，法国局部地区也受到短暂影响。此次大停电是近年来欧洲记录到的最严重事件之一，共计超5000万民众生活被彻底打乱，交通、通信、医疗等关键领域停摆。这场停电暴露出能源转型进程中的深层矛盾，不仅敲响了全球能源体系变革的警钟，也为我国能源转型提供了镜鉴。究竟是什么原因，让欧洲国家陷入如此困境？\n　　极端气候发难。温度的剧烈变化，成为事故导火索。葡萄牙电力部门称，一种“罕见的大气现象”导致温度严重失衡，进而引发大规模停电。西班牙气象部门资料显示，快速升温导致输电线路参数突变，引发频率失衡，用电负荷飙升也加剧了电网压力。\n　　电网结构脆弱。西班牙和葡萄牙部分电网设施老旧，抗极端天气能力不足，这使得电网弹性较差，容易产生故障，且损坏发生后难以修复。同时，两国电网仅通过少数跨境互联线路与法国相连，进而与欧洲其他地区连接。这种特殊结构使得电网一旦出现问题，就会引发连锁反应，导致大面积停电。\n　　 新能源 施压。近年来，西班牙大力发展可再生能源。然而 风能 和 太阳能 具有随机性、间歇性和波动性，如果电力系统调节能力未能跟上 新能源 发展步伐，当极端天气出现， 新能源 发电骤减，电网无法及时平衡电力供需，就容易引发故障。\n　　从大停电发生到逐步恢复供电，整个过程漫长而艰难，部分地区甚至持续数天。为何供电修复如此低效？\n　　电力系统不是电灯开关，按下开关就能重启。电网是复杂系统，重大事故后的恢复极为繁琐。“黑启动”是大面积停电后恢复供电的重要方式，它通常始于小型柴油发 电机 ，这些发 电机 无需从电网获取任何电力即可启动。然后，“黑启动”装置启动大型发 电机 ，恢复选定电网电路的供电，并确保频率和电压稳定。随着越来越多发电机和输电线路重新投入使用，电网逐渐恢复供电。这一过程必须严格按照顺序进行，如果过快地连接大量负载，可能会使发电机过载并再次崩溃。此外，向电网注入电力的速度也必须控制，若速度过快，电力系统可能会再次失稳。\n　　本次大停电事故，也为我国能源转型带来了诸多启示。\n　　能源安全是能源转型的基石。能源安全是关系国家经济社会发展的全局性、战略性、基础性问题。本次事故警示我们，能源转型必须以能源安全为前提。可再生能源“靠天吃饭”的特性对电力系统稳定性提出了更高要求，我们必须在大力发展可再生能源的同时，加强 储能 技术研发和应用，确保能源供应稳定性和可靠性，避免类似的大规模停电事件发生。\n　　电网升级是能源转型的关键。此次停电暴露了欧洲电网系统的脆弱性，而我国电网系统也面临类似挑战。过去的电网架构，是基于传统能源特性设计建设的，随着新能源大规模接入，电网的智能化、灵活性和韧性至关重要。我们需要加快构建新型电力系统，加强跨区域电网互联互通，提升电网的调节能力和应急响应能力，确保在面对极端天气、技术故障等突发情况时，能够快速恢复供电。\n　　应急机制是应对危机的保障。西班牙、葡萄牙大停电事件中，政府的应急响应至关重要。我国应进一步完善能源应急机制，建立健全的应急预案和应急管理体系。在面对突发停电事件时，能够迅速启动应急响应，优先保障关键设施供电，维持社会秩序。\n　　西班牙、葡萄牙大停电事件是一次惨痛教训，让人们看到了能源转型中可能面临的风险和挑战。我国正处于能源转型关键时期，既要保持赶超引领的锐气，更要筑牢安全底线的根基。如何走出一条既“绿”且“稳”的能源转型之路，是中国能源革命必须书写的答案。\n（文章来源：经济日报）",
