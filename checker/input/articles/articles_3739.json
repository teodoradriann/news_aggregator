    "title": "Schmitz sentenced to 10 years for Custer woman's death",
    "text": "Richard Schmitz, the 55-year-old man who accepted responsibility for the 2013 death of 38-year-old Meshell Will, was sentenced Friday morning to 10 years in prison for second-degree manslaughter. Will's body was found near mile marker 54 and the Pigtail Bridges on Iron Mountain Road on Aug. 31, 2013. Senior Deputy Pennington County State's Attorney Roxanne Hammond said Will's body was so decomposed it was \"barely recognizable as human.\" Schmitz and Will lived across the hall from one another in Custer and were in a romantic relationship during the summer of 2013. On Aug. 24, 2013, the two checked into the Brookside Motel in Keystone to spend the weekend together, law enforcement reports show. Hammond said the last time a witness saw Will alive was when the hotel upgraded the couple's room because of maintenance issues. People are also reading… \"Meshell was thrilled,\" Hammond said. In July 2021, eight years after Will's body was found, Schmitz was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. Schmitz's arrest coincided with a 2021 pathology report that ruled Will's manner of death as either undetermined or homicide. The initial autopsy ruled her manner of death as undetermined. \"It's difficult to tell how Meshell died,\" Hammond said, but she pointed to the circumstantial evidence surrounding the case as enough to prove Schmitz killed Will in the hotel room and discarded her body in the Black Hills. Hammond highlighted Schmitz's lies to law enforcement. Investigators interviewed him several times following Will's death. He initially stated he did not see her in the days prior. He told police conducting a welfare check at her residence she returned to Texas. He later admitted he was with her in Keystone, but denied any involvement in her death until he entered an Alford plea to second-degree manslaughter on Jan. 30. An Alford plea is an acknowledgement that the state has enough evidence to convict without explicitly admitting guilt. The plea, however, functions the same as a guilty plea. Hammond asked the judge to sentence Schmitz to the maximum of 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. \"He deserves a lot more time than this court can give him,\" Hammond said. Martha Rossiter, Schmitz's defense attorney, made an impassioned sentencing argument focused primarily on what she characterized as weaknesses in the state's case. She said Will's family knew her to wander off, and she was a heavy drinker who took medications for mental health issues. Rossiter said evidence indicated Will died at the place her body was found, and her body was not moved. She did not, however, dispute that her client lied to law enforcement. \"Mr. Schmitz has an issue being honest, particularly with police,\" Rossiter said. Hammond stated Schmitz killed Will in the hotel room, but Rossiter said hotel staff did not notice anything unusual about the room after the couple's stay. She also called into question the pathologist who determined Will could have died by homicide, highlighting a [1999 Los Angeles Times article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jul-11-mn-54984-story.html) that discussed the overturning of a case where two parents had been convicted of murder based on the pathologist's determinations. Deborah Lemonds, a Custer woman, spoke on behalf of Schmitz as well. She said he took care of her after she suffered an injury, and he \"has never, ever hurt people.\" Rossiter asked Presiding Judge Craig Pfeifle to sentence Schmitz to time served — 966 days — over two-and-a-half years. Pfeifle said although he \"appreciates the passion\" of Rossiter's argument, Schmitz agreed to the plea deal. The judge said he based his sentence off of the plea and Schmitz's past conduct, which included convictions of violent crimes against women. \"You have a significant challenge dealing with romantic relationships in your life,\" Pfeifle said. \"I think you continue to remain a danger.\" The judge emphasized Schmitz could have disputed the facts of the case at trial. \"You elected not to do that,\" he said.

    "title": "PLA Faces Nomadic Resistance",
    "text": "In the rugged terrains of Eastern Ladakh, a recent incident near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) showcased the indomitable spirit of local nomads as they stood their ground against the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China. The confrontation unfolded in the village of Kakjung, where PLA troops attempted to prevent nomads from grazing their cattle. The resilience of the nomads, coupled with the steadfast support of the Indian Army, resulted in a remarkable display of courage and determination. The incident, captured on camera by the locals, revealed a tense standoff between the nomads and PLA soldiers. The nomads, with a strong sense of attachment to their ancestral lands, refused to yield to the Chinese forces’ attempts to restrict their movements. Stones were thrown, voices raised, and the nomads repelled the PLA soldiers, forcing them to retreat. The nomads, undeterred by the foreign intrusion, continue to graze their cattle in the area, a testament to the successful collaboration between the local population and the Indian Army. The incident highlights the unwavering spirit of the Ladakhi nomads. Facing intimidation from troops and armoured vehicles, they stood their ground, refusing to be cowed down.\nStrong civil-military relations have empowered the local communities along the north bank of Pangong. This incident highlighted the positive impact of the Fire and Fury Corps of the Army in bolstering the morale of the locals and safeguarding their interests. The incident underscores the importance of community engagement and the collaborative efforts between the army and the local population in safeguarding the border regions. While the official stance of the Indian Army is yet to be released, the incident highlights the challenges faced by border communities and the critical role played by the army in supporting their rights. The nomads’ ability to repel the PLA sends a powerful message about the resilience and determination of those living in these harsh and contested border areas. The collaboration between the military and the community is crucial to maintaining the cultural and territorial integrity of border regions.\nAs geopolitical tensions persist, the story of Kakjung serves as a reminder of the courage and resilience exhibited by those living on the front lines. The recent stand-off speaks volumes about the intricate dynamics at the LAC. These nomads, grazing their cattle for generations, possess unparalleled knowledge of the territory, making them the unsung heroes of frontline defence. Their act of resistance highlights the critical role of local communities in bolstering border security, especially where army presence might be limited. Recognising their significance, the Government and army have been working hand-in-hand to empower them, viewing them as an extension of security forces. Special facilities and training provided by the army instil confidence and preparedness to confront potential threats.\nFurthermore, this incident underscores the importance of asserting traditional grazing rights. Not only does it symbolise resistance against China’s gradual encroachment strategy, but it also serves as a motivator for other border communities. The sling-wielding nomad exemplifies the community’s readiness to handle immediate situations independently, acting as a warning to China and urging them to refrain from similar attempts. Local politicians’ involvement and appreciation for the nomads act as significant motivators. This event serves as a stark reminder that every member of society has a role to play in national defence. Each act of resistance by the locals reinforces the message that India will meet any aggression with equal measure. Moving forward, a multi-pronged approach is essential. Continued support for border communities through development initiatives and training remains crucial while maintaining clear communication channels and responsible media coverage are paramount to preventing misunderstandings and escalation. By acknowledging the various perspectives of this incident, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex reality at the LAC and strive to defend our territory through responsible actions and collaborative efforts.\nPLA Faces Nomadic Resistance\nIn the rugged terrains of Eastern Ladakh, a recent incident near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) showcased the indomitable spirit of local nomads as they stood their ground against the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China.

    "text": "A notorious threat actor known as ‘Sorb’ claims to have obtained and is selling a CRM database allegedly linked to Nike’s use of ESnkrs platform. This platform has been compromised, exposing sensitive information from over 42 million log entries (totalling 11.9 GB) spanning four years, from 2020 to 2024.\nThe ESnkrs platform is a raffle bot that simultaneously automates registration forms and submits entries to multiple raffles. Due to their speed and efficiency at repetitive data entry tasks, these tools allow users to submit significantly more entries than manual submission.\nCompanies use raffle bots to manage online raffles of limited-edition products like sneakers.\nAutomating form-filling and submission verification gives users employing these tools a substantial statistical advantage over those entering manually, making traditional single-entry participation increasingly challenging in the current landscape.\nThe leaked dataset can include a wide range of sensitive user information:\n- Discord IDs: Potentially linking users to their online profiles and activities.\n- Email addresses: Enabling phishing and spam campaigns.\n- Physical and IP addresses: Creating opportunities for doxxing or geographically targeted attacks.\n- Proxy usage details: Indicating attempts by users to bypass restrictions, which could interest malicious actors.\nThis breach poses significant privacy and security risks for affected users if verified. Personal data such as email addresses and physical locations could make them vulnerable to phishing, identity theft, and targeted harassment.\nThe presence of proxy details could also expose users’ attempts to circumvent regional restrictions, potentially leading to further scrutiny or exploitation.\nIn other news, Kia Russia faced a massive data leak where hackers stole over 700,000 leads and approximately 120,000 user records. This year, some high-profile government agencies also faced data leaks. For instance, the Brazilian Finance Ministry was hit by a data breach exposing financial information.\nIn India, too, the child welfare agency of Madhya Pradesh was hit by a ransomware attack by Funksec. The threat actors claim to have infiltrated 2 GB of sensitive data from the agency’s system.\nIn the News: VLC previews AI-generated subtitles at CES 2025",

    "title": "Canicules : Les écoles vont être massivement touchées… pourtant l'Etat freine les rénovations",
    "text": "Aude Lorriaux\nAlors que plus de 2.000 établissements scolaires ont été fermés en France ces derniers jours à cause de la canicule - 2.213 pour être précis - plusieurs questions taraudent les parents des marmots qui suffoquent en silence, ou sont contraints de rester chez eux : l’école française est-elle adaptée aux fortes chaleurs ? Que font les établissements pour protéger les enfants ? Et surtout, que fait l’Etat ?\nJusqu’à une période récente, la question ne se posait pas. Les canicules s’installaient au mois de juillet et août, au moment où les écoles fermaient. On construisait des bâtiments sans prendre en question la question climatique, du moins pas la chaleur de l’été. Mais aujourd’hui, ces évènements climatiques sont « plus longs, arrivent plus tôt dans l’année - dès le mois de juin - et durent plus tard, jusqu’en septembre, explique Alexandre Florentin, élu Les Écologistes au Conseil de Paris, qui a mené la mission « Paris à 50 °C ». Ils pourraient même s’installer dès le mois de mai et durer jusqu’au mois d’octobre, d’ici à 2.100.\nDes alertes depuis des années\nBien avant que la France n’étouffe sur six mois de l’année, les écoles telles que nous les connaissons aujourd’hui deviendront infréquentables. D’ici à 2030, d’après les estimations de l’entreprise de conseil en environnement Ecoact, plus de 7.000 écoles maternelles seront exposées à des vagues de chaleur supérieures à 35 °C. Avec des conséquences immédiates pour les capacités d’apprentissages, puisqu’on estime qu’au-dessus de 28 degrés, celles-ci déclinent.\nQue font, en réponse, les écoles pour s’adapter à ce changement climatique ? Les recommandations du ministère de l’Education nationale, prodiguées dimanche 29 juin à travers un communiqué, font rire jaune les acteurs de terrain : « Utiliser, dans la mesure du possible, des salles à l’ombre pour les épreuves », « Fermer les volets et rideaux des façades les plus exposées au soleil durant toute la journée », « Maintenir les fenêtres fermées tant que la température extérieure est supérieure à la température intérieure »… « Tout ce qui est préconisé, les personnels le font déjà. Le communiqué du ministère enfonce une porte ouverte. On est en colère », commente Aurélie Gagnier, porte-parole du FSU-SNUipp, syndicat du premier degré.\nSi les syndicats sont amers face à ces annonces, c’est parce qu’ils alertent depuis des années, sans voir le ministère se saisir réellement de ces enjeux. « En 2019, nous avions alerté Jean-Michel Blanquer (ex-ministre de l’Education nationale), nous lui demandions de faire poser des volets, de faire en sorte qu’il ait des points d’eau, de végétaliser. Mais en six ans, cela a très peu progressé », constate Aurélie Gagnier.\n50 milliards au bas mot pour rénover\nImpossible pour beaucoup d’écoles d’aérer la nuit, comme le font la plupart des gens, pour refroidir les locaux. Le personnel présent la nuit n’est pas assez nombreux, le risque d’intrusion est trop grand. Surtout, le bâti scolaire présente pour certains établissements toutes les caractéristiques d’une bouilloire thermique, soit un bâtiment extrêmement mal isolé qui se transforme en four l’été. « J’ai déjà vu un relevé de 44 degrés en septembre dans une école », commente Alexandre Florentin. Le programme de recherche-action « Racine » a quant à lui mesuré 37 degrés dans une école. Et nous ne sommes qu’en 2025.\nSeule solution pour anticiper des fermetures massives, il faut rénover. Considérant comme inacceptable d’ « acter une rupture dans la continuité du service public d’éducation », le syndicat Sud Education demande un « plan national de rénovation énergétique et écologique du bâti scolaire public ». « Nous attendons un plan massif de 50 milliards », demande Aurélie Gagnier, qui tire ce chiffre d’un rapport de 2023 sur l’adaptation du bâti scolaire aux enjeux climatiques, chiffre qui ne concerne que le premier degré. « Les besoins financiers seront en tout état de cause supérieurs aux 52 milliards d’euros évoqués », soulignent les rapporteures de ce texte.\nLes écoles ne pourront pas se passer de clim\nDans la course à la rénovation thermique, certaines villes caracolent en tête. C’est le cas de Paris, qui construit à tour de bras des cours oasis, censées apporter « davantage de végétation, une meilleure gestion de l’eau de pluie et des points d’eau ». Et rénove ses écoles, parfois en délogeant les enfants pour effectuer des rénovations en profondeur. Le travail sur le parc scolaire est ainsi la première mesure de la mission « Paris à 50 degrés », qui recommande de « débitumiser au maximum les cours en y créant une végétalisation de pleine terre ». « Paris est une des rares collectivités de France qui suit le rythme des accords de Paris, ce qui signifie que tout sera rénové en 2050 », commente Alexandre Florentin.\nMais d’ici à 2050, toutes les écoles parisiennes seront exposées à des vagues de chaleur atteignant 35 degrés. Et par ailleurs, d’autres villes sont loin de rénover au même rythme. Il apparaît donc hautement improbable que les écoles de l’Hexagone puissent se passer de climatisation, à court ou moyen terme. Avec les conséquences que l’on sait : si on double le nombre de climatiseurs à Paris en 2030, ils pourraient faire grimper la température de 0,5 à 3 degrés supplémentaires.\n« Coupes drastiques » dans les aides à la rénovation\nOn pourrait espérer limiter cet impact en forme de cercle vicieux, en accélérant encore le rythme des rénovations énergétiques des écoles, mais ce n’est semble-t-il pas l’option prise par l’Etat, qui a opéré des « coupes drastiques » dans le plan de réhabilitation des écoles présenté en 2023 par Emmanuel Macron, dénonce Sud Education, qui prévoyait de rénover 40.000 écoles. Le Fonds Vert, budget spécial pour aider les collectivités pour ces chantiers, a été raboté de moitié cette année. Environ 5.000 écoles ont néanmoins été rénovées depuis le lancement de ce plan, a cependant annoncé la ministre de la Transition écologique le 1er juillet.\n« C’est une question nationale or cela n’intéresse pas beaucoup les ministres qui se succèdent, dénonce Alexandre Florentin. Depuis 2003, le pays a pris des dispositions pour personnes âgées, avec des clims dans les Ehpad, des protocoles, des équipes renforcées l’été. Il n’y a pas d’équivalent côté Education nationale. Or la prochaine population qui va être en souffrance, ce sont les enfants en bas âge et les femmes enceintes. Nous faisons grandir nos enfants dans des endroits où nous n’accepterions même pas de travailler. »",

    "title": "The Beautiful Story and Meaning Behind “O Come All Ye Faithful”",
    "text": "As Christmas is upon us, it becomes time to start singing the familiar songs that we know and love. These songs have a special place in my heart, being a pastor’s kid. I would hear these songs every year leading up to Christmas, and it would fill me with such excitement as I waited to celebrate the holiday. One of my favorite hymns that was sung was “O Come All Ye Faithful.”\nEvery year, we sing these same songs without really knowing much about them. Each song has a story about how it was written and a meaning behind it. Let’s look at “O Come All Ye Faithful” and discover where it came from and why it was written.\nThe History of “O Come All Ye Faithful”\nThe hymn “O Come All Ye Faithful” is believed to have been written between the years of 1740 and 1743, as the earliest manuscripts of it show. It seems to be a collaboration between a group of individuals, but John Francis Wade is the one who has his name written on the hymn that we see today. Wade was an English musician who made his living off of copying and selling music. This hymn was originally written in Latin, with the title being “Adeste Fideles,\" and comes from a Roman Catholic tradition. It was later translated into the English version by Frederick Oakeley, William Brooke, and Abbé Etienne Jean François Borderies. Oakeley translated verses 1, 2, and 3 of the hymn. Borderies is known to have translated three more.\nAfter Oakeley had done his translating, the hymn appeared in a hymnal that was used in the English church. It went by the title, “Let us go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass.” Many other versions and alterations of this well-known hymn exist as well.\nOne particular thing to note is that the second verse seems to be inspired by the Nicene Creed, which was written at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. What a unique characteristic that links us back to the early years of church history. It makes the significance of this hymn that much richer.\nThe Meaning Behind “O Come All Ye Faithful”\nThe beautiful story in this hymn takes us right to the words of Luke 2. It’s a beautiful thing that part of the Christmas story can be told not only in the Bible but in song as well.\nAs the text says, shepherds were tending to their flocks when all of a sudden, angels appeared before them. They were terrified, but the angels reassured them that they should not be afraid because of the wonderful news they had for them. On that very day, the Messiah had been born in Bethlehem. He would be recognized by this sign, “You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.” (Vs. 12) Suddenly, the angel was joined by many others, and they were singing and praising God. When the angels were gone, the shepherds decided to go to Bethlehem and see for themselves what the angels had proclaimed to them. They went to Bethlehem, and they found Mary, Joseph, and the baby just like they had been told. The shepherds told everyone about what they had experienced, and they all were amazed. After all of this, the shepherds returned to the fields to tend to their sheep again. As they went back, they praised God for all that had happened.\n“O Come All Ye Faithful” seems to put us as worshipers right in the middle of the story. In the first verse, we are beckoned to come and see what has taken place in Bethlehem. Jesus, our Savior, has been born, the one who frees us from all of our sins. All who believe in him are welcome. We are invited along with the shepherds to behold what has happened.\nThe second verse reminds us that he chose to become like each one of us and be born as a baby. He was fully human, but at the same time, he was not created like us. He was completely divine as well, even in his human state.\nThe third verse tells us all who are citizens of heaven to sing along with the angels about our God. He is worthy of our praise from everyone on earth and in heaven. We can rejoice and be glad because of what Jesus has done for us.\nThe fourth verse proclaims that all glory goes to Jesus. He was the “Word of God,” coming to us in flesh and bones just like us. What a wonderful thought that even though he is God, he has experienced everything that we do. He is not a God who is far off but one who came to meet us where we are.\nThere is so much that went into writing this beloved hymn and the significance that it has. I like to think back to all the people who contributed to it and wonder if they could even dream that it would be part of our present Christmas celebrations. They probably wouldn’t realize how many versions and translations that there would be of it.\nWhat a blessing those of us get to have this hymn be a part of our celebrations of Christmas. It’s not always easy to have the words to express how we feel. Much like the worship leaders of our time who give us beautiful songs to sing, these individuals who wrote this hymn have given us a way to express how we feel with the words they have written. These are not just random words; they are words that remind us of the great sacrifice and love of Jesus. We need reminders like this in the world we live in. It is so easy to forget the hope that we have when we are in the middle of everyday life. The hardships and trials of this life can be overwhelming and can cloud our vision if we let it. Thank goodness that at the end of the day, we can take our focus off of our problems and place them on the one who came to save us. This is what we get to celebrate as we sing these hymns at Christmas. Jesus who came to earth as a baby, our king who did not think of himself too highly, who became like us, should be given all the glory and praise. I know that I need to hear this right now, and I am sure others do as well.\nThis is why hymns like “O Come All Ye Faithful” have been written. There is a reason to sing and celebrate during Christmas because of the hope that we have in Jesus. We can come together with other believers and the angels in heaven to behold our Savior. I pray this knowledge makes our Christmas season that much more joy-filled.",

    "text": "The union umbrella Travail.Suisse published its “Barometer of working conditions” this Friday. Well, it seems the Swiss don’t like them that much. According to the organization: “The representative results for 2024 clearly show the extent of stress and overload in the world of work.”\nThe result is that “six out of seven workers admit to sometimes being too exhausted after work to still take care of their personal or family affairs.” Worse still, one in three people say they are “exhausted very often”. A result described as “record” by Travail.Suisse.\nIn this context, hundreds of thousands of people would be looking to change jobs next year. This situation worries national advisor Léonore Porchet (V/VD), vice-president of the organization: “The fight against stress must be an absolute political priority. (…) If more than 770,000 workers are thinking of changing jobs next year because of the stress they have undergone, we can clearly see that we must combat stress not only for reasons of health protection, but also in the interest of the national economy.\nSwiss",
