    "title": "Will the Northern Lights be visible in South Carolina?",
    "text": "Stargazers could be in store for a spectacular show Thursday night. A coronal mass ejection - a large cloud of energized and magnetized plasma ejected from the sun - reached Earth on Thursday. The northern lights were already on full display in darker parts of the world. When these sun outbursts are directed toward Earth, they cause geomagnetic storms which disturb Earth's magnetic field. Severe geomagnetic storm (G4) conditions were observed Thursday afternoon and will remain possible Thursday night. According to the Space Weather Prediction Center, there is even a possibility the storm will reach extreme (G5) levels. So what does this all mean? Severe to extreme geomagnetic storms are capable of impacting communication satellite systems, power grids, and GPS services. FEMA has been informed this could disrupt recovery efforts for Hurricane Milton. If the storm's intensity remains at a G4, the northern lights may be visible low on the horizon or with a high exposure camera in South Carolina. If the storm intensifies to a G5, then it is more likely the northern lights will be visible to the naked eye in the Palmetto State. Those rare G5 conditions were met earlier this year on May 10th, resulting in a rare northern lights display over the Midlands. The sun has been more active this year as it nears the peak in its 11-year solar cycle. Those hoping to catch a glimpse in South Carolina can expect clear skies Thursday night. Your best chance at seeing the northern lights will be at locations away from city lights. Smartphones set to night mode can often capture what our eyes can't see.",

    "text": "CNN political commentator Van Jones is tired of people holding [Kamala Harris](https://hollywoodunlocked.com/?s=Kamala+Harris+) and Donald Trump to different standards. On Wednesday, Van Jones weighed in on the tight race between the two candidates. CNN’s Erin Burnett questioned Jones about a new report from The Wall Street Journal showing Trump is leading by nearly 10 percent in the upcoming election. [RELATED: Beyonce To Reportedly Join Kamala Harris At Campaign Rally In Houston](https://hollywoodunlocked.com/beyonce-to-reportedly-join-kamala-harris-at-campaign-rally-in-houston/) “Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are not taking the same exam,” Jones replied. “I think it bothers people. They’re not taking the same exam. He gets to be lawless. She has to be flawless. That’s what’s unfair.” “She has policies, she may not articulate them perfectly every time, she may not put the stories in the right places, but she’s fighting for actual ideas that will help real people, and he’s talking about peoples’ penises,” Jones added. Jones’ comments comes after a panel discussion on CNN took place about Harris’ performance at a town hall hosted by the network, where she took questions from undecided and persuadable voters in Pennsylvania, a key battleground in the election. Most recently, Kamala Harris has been slamming Donald Trump for his praise of Adolf Hitler. “It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler — the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews, and hundreds of thousands of Americans,” Harris said from her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington.

    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021.\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK.\nThe data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change.\nAll figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.\nSystems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nSome forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate.\nNot all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end.\n– Avon & Somerset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nThe force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion.\n– Gwent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3\nThe force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries.\n– Hampshire & Isle of Wight\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4\n– Hertfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record.\n– Humberside\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2\n– Kent\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6\nThe force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached.

The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures.\n– Northumbria\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim.\n– Nottinghamshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19\nThe force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker.\n– South Wales\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9\nThe force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”.\n– Suffolk\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0\n– Surrey\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10\nThe force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member.\n– Thames Valley\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20\n– Warwickshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: No information held\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods.\n– West Mercia\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4\n– West Midlands\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”.\n– West Yorkshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49\nThe force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.”\n– Wiltshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nSome 15 forces are not included in this list.

    "text": "La noticia ha sido una bomba política. Íñigo Errejón deja la política. Al principio, las causas de su caída son confusas. Luego se sabe que la decisión viene propiciada por una denuncia anónima por un presunto delito de acoso sexual en la que ni siquiera se le nombra.\nEn principio, lo que me sorprende es que nadie respete la presunción de inocencia. Sus ex compañeros Pablo Iglesias e Irene Montero asumen implícitamente las acusaciones. \"Ante cualquier caso de violencia sexual lo primero son las víctimas... \", dice en X Montero. Su compañero reproduce el mensaje: \"Íñigo Errejón dimite de todos sus cargos y abandona la política por acusaciones de violencia sexual\". Requiem in pace .\nEl partido del que era portavoz, Sumar, hizo un comunicado en el que afirma que \"se inicia un proceso para recabar información sobre las declaraciones que se habían vertido, fundamentalmente en redes sociales, sobre Íñigo Errejón\". A las 19,10 de la tarde, desde Colombia, donde se encuentra en una cumbre, Yolanda Díaz , también en X remata: \"Nuestro compromiso contra el machismo y por una sociedad feminista es firme y sin excepciones\".\nTodo suena a falso. Los comentarios en redes sociales no obligan a ningún partido a abrir una investigación interna. Se dicen tantas barbaridades... A no ser que la líder y los dirigentes de Sumar lo supieran ya de antes. Y si lo sabían, ¿por qué no lo denunciaron?\nPero, con todo, lo más alucinante de este caso es la carta del propio Errejón en X . El ya ex portavoz de Sumar no dice nada de acoso ni de violencia sexual. No admite que haya cometido ningún delito, tan sólo suelta un discurso farragoso para auto justificarse. Lo más parecido a una confesión se encierra en un párrafo confuso, en el que achaca a la política \"una subjetividad tóxica que en el caso de los hombres el patriarcado multiplica, con compañeros y compañeras de trabajo, con compañeros y compañeras de organización, con relaciones afectivas e incluso con uno mismo\". Hay que ser muy fino para colegir de ese alambicado argumento que Errejón está admitiendo algún comportamiento machista.\nNadie respeta la presunción de inocencia. Si sus compañeros piensan que es culpable, ¿por qué no lo han denunciado?\nEs verdad que en ese texto, el ex fundador de Podemos junto a Pablo Iglesias, asume que lleva tiempo \"trabajando en un proceso personal y de acompañamiento psicológico\" (cosa que yo no sé como interpretar). Lo que sí dice claramente es que no puede soportar la dualidad entre el personaje y la persona que está viviendo por llevar en la primera línea de la política tanto tiempo. Una contradicción entre \"una forma de vida neoliberal\" y unos ideales que no tienen nada que ver con ese estilo de vida. ¡Acabáramos! Ahora resulta que la culpa de lo que le pasa es que lleva una \"vida neoliberal\". ¿Qué significa eso? ¿Que come caviar todos los días? ¿Que no da ni chapa? ¿Que trata de forma vejatoria a sus subordinados/as?\nYo creo que se trata de una carta para darnos pena. Me recuerda un poco en su estilo llorón a la que escribió Pedro Sánchez en abril. Me parece que tanto el presidente como el ex portavoz de Podemos coinciden en la idea de que no nos merecemos a gente tan buena como ellos.\nEl fin de Errejón es la puntilla a Sumar. Resulta curioso que este desplante haya coincidido en el tiempo con la despedida de Ada Colau del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona. Es una época que acaba. Un sueño que se desvanece y que comenzó su declive con un chalé en Galapagar .\nDe este caso, del caso Errejón , me interesa esa cadena de sobreentendidos, de decir sin decir, de acusar sin acusar, de reconocer sin reconocer. ¿Por qué la supuesta victima no ha dado su nombre? ¿Acaso tiene miedo? ¿Por qué no se ha hecho una denuncia formal en una comisaría de policía?\nPor más que Errejón fuera con mucho la persona más brillante de Sumar, nada le disculpa si ha cometido un delito. Un delito que su grupo ha elevado a la categoría máxima, una traición a uno de los principios básicos de ese movimiento que nació con el 15-M.\nErrejón tiene ahora 40 años. Hace diez, cuando todavía era el amigo y compañero de Iglesias, parecía que se iba a comer el mundo. Era como el Lamine Yamal de la política, el Trostki que necesita todo Lenin . Ahora ya no es nada. Y han sido sus propios compañeros los que ni siquiera le han dado la más mínima presunción de inocencia. Unos porque se relamen pensando en la venganza después de años de enfrentamiento y odio mutuo; otros, por cobardía, porque quieren alejar de sí el cáliz de la vergüenza.\nMientras no se demuestre lo contrario, yo sigo creyendo en su inocencia. Por el momento, sólo se le puede acusar de ser un cursi un punto soberbio.\nComunicado íntegro de Errejón en el que anuncia su salida de la política\nEn los últimos meses, y de forma más insistente en las últimas semanas, he ido pensando en que tenía que […]",

    "text": "Newly named director of Campus Safety hopes to hear from students and become a familiar face\nby Nicole Greenberg ’25, Editor-in-Chief\nJudith “Judie” Trimboli will begin a new role as director of Campus Safety on Monday, Dec. 9. A desire to connect with students on campus prompted her interest in the role. “I wanted a position where I was going to be more boots on the ground, engaging with students, listening to them, hearing concerns, strategizing, problem solving,” she explained. As she begins her tenure at Campus Safety, Trimboli plans to be on campus at night working with the officers, sharing that she believes it is “the only way to truly understand what’s happening…to determine the needs of the community.”\nHamilton administration began a nationwide search to fill the director of Campus Safety position in August following the retirement of Francis “Frank” Coots, who served as Hamilton’s director of Campus Safety for seven years. Trimboli was chosen from a group of four finalists, Dean of Students Chris Card explained in an email on Dec. 3. She will take over the role from Assistant Director of Campus Safety Wayne Gentile Jr. who acted as interim director of the department during the search process.\nTrimboli has served the Hamilton community since July 2021, when she joined the Dean of Students Office as Campus Investigator and Compliance Officer. In this role, her work primarily relates to Title IX, investigating reports of sexual harassment and misconduct, and student conduct investigations. Trimboli also conducts all first-year training sessions, meaning she has “been in front of every student on this campus at least once,” leading her to feel a strong connection to the student body. She shared that she has been “jokingly saying [she is] a fourth year this year.”\nTrimboli’s current title falls within the Dean of Students office, but she collaborates frequently with Campus Safety. She noted that she has already worked with everybody in the department. “I’m really hoping it’s going to be a pretty seamless [transition] because we’ve already established working relationships and we all have respect for each other,” she said. Trimboli attends Campus Safety’s weekly leadership meetings, where she lends “help and expertise” to the department. She also works with Campus Safety for any large scale social events, “like Class & Charter Day or Great Names or graduation or the inauguration.”\nTrimboli is also a member of the Hamilton Emergency Response Team (HERT), a group of stakeholders on campus that meet regularly to discuss possible emergency scenarios and assess needs on campus “so that if a situation occurs, we are better able to respond and we are better trained.” She attends all discussions for that team and has “been responsible for all of the Everbridge emergency messaging that goes out in times of crisis on campus.”\nIn the spring of 2023, a social media post threatening gun violence led to a campus-wide lockdown. Afterwards, students expressed concerns regarding safety and emergency procedures on campus, including inconsistent and contradictory messaging from the Everbridge system. Specifically, a message stated an active shooter was on campus even though there was no confirmed active shooter, only a threat. When asked about this event, Trimboli did not offer a personal statement on the matter, instead referring The Spectator to Jeff Landry, the director of HERT, for a unified response from the team.\nStudent activism — on campus and at colleges nationwide — continues to generate conversations about the relationship between law enforcement and protest. Trimboli shared that she cannot yet discuss any specific plans for the department, but her tactic, for now, is to listen. “I really want to spend time getting to know all of the student groups on campus. I want to hear what their concerns are. I want to hear what possible ideas they have for solutions. I want to hear what makes them feel safe and when they feel unsafe.”\nLooking forward, Trimboli hopes students will feel comfortable engaging with her. “I loved how the students would engage with Frank. They seemed to all know who Frank was, and I hope there is a day where they all feel as comfortable with Judy,” she said. One piece of student engagement she looks forward to is feedback. Though she asks for “some grace and some time to get [her] feet on the ground,” Trimboli is eager to hear the concerns and thoughts of members of the Hamilton community. “I really want to be that approachable person that people can come to and say, ‘hey, I saw something really good the other day’ or ‘hey, this kind of bothered me’ because we can’t fix what we don’t know.”",

    "text": "New Yorkers certainly love their takeout.\nSupposedly, in NYC, around 45 to-go food searches are made each month per 1,000 residents, according to a study from Betway, originally reported by Time Out .\nWhile it’s easier than ever for New Yorkers to snap their fingers and have food delivered to their home — they have to be careful with how long they’re storing their leftover food in the fridge and how they’re reheating it, especially anything involving rice.\nSurprisingly, cooked rice can harbor a toxin-producing bacterium called Bacillus cereus.\n3 Surprisingly, cooked rice is a dangerous food. ahirao – stock.adobe.com “[The bacteria] survives the initial cooking process as a spore and if [the rice is] left out at room temperature, it’ll produce toxins,” Emily Hovis, an assistant teaching professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health, explained to Right as Rain by UW Medicine .\n“So even when you reheat [rice], you’re killing the vegetative cells, you’re not destroying the toxins.”\nAnd these toxins can cause food poisoning or sometimes more serious health issues , especially if a person has a compromised immune system or is pregnant.\nWhen reheating rice or any leftover food — on the stovetop or in the microwave — the food should reach an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees , according to experts. You can check this using an inexpensive food thermometer.\n3 There are certain things to know about reheating leftover food. Getty Images/iStockphoto Speaking of reheating, as tempting as it may be to throw yesterday’s takeout order of vodka pasta in the microwave to reheat it using the plastic container it came in — experts warn against this.\nAs reported in Well & Good , those containers can have materials that spread chemicals like microplastics, phthalates or BPA into your food.\n“When these plastics are heated, they can break down and release harmful chemicals into your food, increasing your exposure to toxins,” Shanina Knighton, PhD, RN, an infection preventionist and adjunct associate professor at Case Western Reserve University , told the outlet.\n3 As tempting as it may be to reheat food in the plastic container it comes in — try your best to avoid doing it. Seventyfour – stock.adobe.com “The hotter, greasier, or more acidic your food is, the more likely these chemicals will leach into your meal,” the expert said.\nInstead of lazily relying on the dangerous takeout containers, store your leftover food in the fridge in a container with an air-tight lid and always reheat it in microwave-safe ceramic, glass bowls or plates, according to the Food Network .\nAnd considering 32% of Americans admit they’re likely to forget about leftovers once they’re out of sight, try not to let your leftover pizza sit in the fridge for longer than three or four days, because food can still go bad there.\nAccording to the USDA , “spoilage bacteria can grow at cold temperatures, such as in the refrigerator. Eventually, they cause food to develop off or bad tastes and smells.”",
