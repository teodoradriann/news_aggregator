    "text": "Girl Scouts of Southern Alabama gives back to the Wiregrass The group’s most recent effort was the Hometown Hero project cookie delivery at Fort Novosel DOTHAN, Ala. (WTVY) - Over the last 112 years, Girl Scouts have pushed boundaries for the better. The organization pushes girls to strive for greatness and empowers them to accomplish this today, tomorrow, and beyond. Girl Scouts of Southern Alabama accomplishes this in the 30 counties it serves. “The focus of Girl Scouts is helping build girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the world a better place,” Karlyn Edmonds, the CEO, said. It all begins with teaching leadership skills and teaching the importance of community service and patriotism. Edmonds said this is to prepare these girls to be productive citizens. One of the group’s most recent efforts was the Hometown Heroes Donation Program where they donated 50 cases of cookies to Fort Novosel. “We want to make sure those people feel a little bit of love from the Girl Scouts and a thank you for their service,” Edmonds said. This is an annual project to show appreciation to military service members, police departments, fire rescue, and other first responders. “We offer the opportunity both for people to maybe they don’t want to actually purchase a box of cookies themselves, or they are a company that wants to give back to their community, to donate funds for our cookies for our hometown heroes,” Edmonds said. When you think of Girl Scouts you probably think of your favorite cookie. Whether it’s Thin Mints, Samoas, or Tagalongs, just know there is so much more meaning behind this program than these cookies. Edmonds is not only the CEO of Girl Scouts of Southern Alabama, but she is a Girl Scout mom. Her daughter has been a Girl Scout for 13 years. “Not only have I seen the magic that girl scouting provides for so many girls across southern Alabama, I have seen it in my own home,” Edmonds said. It’s a strong task, but it’s all done while having a little fun. “It’s fun to make new friends and I can make more friends and have more fun,” Emma Ehrig, a Girl Scout, said. The group’s calendar stays filled with trips and activities. “From spending the night at the Montgomery Biscuits Stadium to exploring different activities at Troy University and at Auburn University,” Edmonds said. “We also do an overnight at the USS Alabama each year. We also do some programming around STEM. You name it and if that’s what the girls are interested in, that is what we provide for them.” An extra plus to keep these girls motivated and earn recognition for their dedication to the organization’s mission is earning badges. Audrey Griger has been a Girl Scout for four years. She has too many badges to count…her favorite? “The babysitting course one,” Geiger said. A course where she learned about babysitting safety. She was taught hands-on experience for a skill she can use for life. “I know the Girl Scout experience is making a difference in the lives of girls across southern Alabama and really across the world and it’s an honor to be a part of that,” Edmonds said. These girls challenge you to become, invest, or volunteer. Girl Scouts is open to girls in kindergarten through 12th grade. There are numerous ways for you to join the Girl Scouts mission. “We are always looking for new volunteers to support these girls,” Edmonds said.

    "text": "Umer Jamshaid Published September 13, 2024 | 05:00 PM\nSeattle, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 13th Sep, 2024) Thousands of Boeing factory workers in the United States walked off the job Friday after voting overwhelmingly to reject a contract with the embattled aviation giant, its first strike in 16 years.\nUnion leaders called for the strike to start just after midnight on Friday (0700 GMT), hours after hourly workers in the Seattle region in the Pacific Northwest spurned the tentative contract with a vote of 94.6 percent and to strike with 96 percent.\nA strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants for the 737 MAX and 777 in the Puget Sound region and sidelines some 33,000 workers, further delaying the financially stressed company 's turnaround efforts.\n\"Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,\" said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, after the vote .\n\"We strike at midnight.\"\nPicketers were out in front of the Renton plant -- where Boeing's flagship 737 Max aircraft is produced -- in the early hours of Friday, holding signs reading \"On strike against Boeing\", according to Bloomberg.\nThursday's vote was a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto, entertainment and other industries.",

    "text": "D-Wave CEO Says Jensen Huang’s Comments ‘100% Off Base:’ Stocktwits Poll Shows Retail Divided Over Outlook For Quantum Computing Industry Prospects D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz said the company’s powerful annealing quantum computing solutions are already available and are being used for solving real-world problems of businesses, researchers and governments.\nStocktwits Inc First Published Jan 10, 2025, 7:31 AM IST | Last Updated Jan 10, 2025, 7:31 AM IST Follow After Nvidia Corp. ($NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang triggered a sell-off in quantum computing stocks on Wednesday, D-Wave Quantum, Inc. ($QBTS) CEO Alan Baratz talked up the industry’s prospects in an interview with CNBC.\nReleasing excerpts of the interview on Thursday, D-Wave noted that its CEO said the company’s powerful annealing quantum computing solutions are already available and are being used for solving real-world problems of businesses, researchers and governments.\nBaratz noted that there are different quantum computing solutions, with some maturing faster than others. He added that among the different approaches to quantum, annealing and gate are the two primary approaches.\nThe executive said Huang’s comments may not be totally off base for gate model quantum computers, they are 100% off base for annealing quantum computers. “When it comes to D-Wave annealing quantum computing, he is dead wrong,” Baratz said.\nIn an Analyst event held late Tuesday, Huang poured cold water on the optimism regarding quantum computing by stating that it might take 15 to 30 years to develop very useful quantum computers, with 20 years being a more credible timeframe.\nBaratz said, “We are not 30 years out, we're not 20 years out, we're not 15 years out. We are today. We are supporting businesses today with quantum compute to solve their hard problems.”\nAccording to D-Wave’s CEO, the company has been able to solve problems on its quantum computer in the area of materials simulation in minutes, which otherwise would take more than millions of years to solve on massively parallel graphic processing unit (GPU) computers.\nD-Wave said annealing quantum computing is emerging as the critical accelerant to commercial adoption of quantum computing. It believes that nearly every industry can benefit from annealing quantum computing technology.\nQuantum annealing, which uses quantum mechanics to solve optimization problems, relies on the process of annealing that involves heating, soaking and cooling a material to improve its properties.\nBaratz’ comments, which temporarily lifted retail sentiment toward D-Wave stock following the interview, haven’t been successful in producing a lasting impact.\nQBTS sentiment and message volume January 9, 2025, as of 8:51 pm ET | Source: Stocktwits On Stocktwits, the sentiment meter read 35/100, suggesting a return of ‘bearish’ mood toward D-Wave after it improved to ‘bullish’ a day ago. Message volume has tapered off from ‘extremely high’ levels to ‘normal.’\nAn ongoing Stocktwits poll that sought opinions from retail watchers of quantum computing stocks on the platform said, views are divided. About 44% of the respondents said they would be bullish and considered Tuesday’s move as merely a ‘dip.’\nA sizeable 32% said the technology is in its nascent stage and the hype about quantum computing stocks is fading. Fifteen percent said they were staying out, considering quantum computing investments as risky and 9% voted that they would trade the swings despite their views that these stocks are speculative investments.\nD-Wave stock fell 36.13% to $6.10 on Tuesday but climbed 6.39% in the after-hours session.\nThe stock had surged up by 855% in 2024 but is down over 27% so far this year.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\nFor more reliable and latest news subscribe to Asianet Newsable WhatsApp channel by clicking here.
