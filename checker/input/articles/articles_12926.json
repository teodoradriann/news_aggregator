    "title": "Best Armor In Helldivers 2",
    "text": "Now that armor rating issues have (mostly) been fixed, and both Medium and Heavy armors have received a small buff, Helldivers now have a wide variety of armor to choose from in\nHelldivers 2. As a rule of thumb, the best amor to choose will depend on what enemies you intend to face, the mission you need accomplished, and sometimes, what weapon your allies are bringing because everyone knows friendly fire isn't friendly. [ ](/helldivers-2-super-credits-farm-guide/)\nWith new Helldivers 2 Warbonds releasing every month, it's so important to have a quick and reliable method for farming Super Credits.\n[ Helldivers 2: Super Credits Farm Guide ](/helldivers-2-super-credits-farm-guide/)\nTo give your Helldiver the best possible advantage against the many enemies of democracy, this list breaks down the best armor you should wear, and against which faction they will serve you best. Whether you're preparing to take on\nswarms of Terminids or hordes of Automatons, this list will cover the armor you want to bring to the battlefield.\nUpdated by Chris Ng on April 11, 2024: This list has been expanded to include 5 additional armor sets, including ones available in the latest\nPremium Warbond, Democratic Detonation (B-01 Tactical, EX-03 Prototype 3 Armor/ Ex-16 Prototype 16 Armor, CE-27 Ground Breaker/SA-12 Servo Assisted, CM-17 Butcher Armor, CE-07 Demolition Specialist). Entries have also been streamlined to include the latest info regarding stat fixes, along with where you can acquire each armor.\n20 B-27 Fortified Commando\nArmor Rating\n| |\n200\nStamina\n| |\n450\nStamina Regen\n| |\n50\nPassive\n| |\nExtra Padding\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Best of the worst armors\n- Highest Armor Rating in the game\n- May become better in the future\nThe Fortified Commando sadly sits as the best of the worst armors. This armor has the highest Armor Rating in the game, making it the perfect symbol for both the biggest strengths and weakness of the heavy armor archetype.\nExtra padding puts this armor at a staggering 200 Armor, allowing your helldiver to tank through 7 - 9 hits from small enemies before finally going down. The additional protection will also push you out of one-shot range of most attacks like the automatons rocket launchers. However, the heavy toll on speed and stamina regeneration makes it a less than ideal choice for missions where you need to run around. However, all of these points are also what make the armor perfect for Eradication missions.\nBesides its problems with speed, the flaws in this armor highlight an overall problem with heavy armor - head shots against a Helldiver ignore all Armor Rating. This means if an enemy ever hits your head you'll take the same amount of damage as a light armor would. This limits the usefulness of Extra Padding since you'll still die to 2 - 3 headshots. In order for a Heavy Armor to be good, it needs to bring more utility in addition to its additional protection.\nRegardless, keep an eye on this suit for the future. If the damage of critical hits is ever changed, this suit will become much better. Alternatively, if new vehicles could help Fortified Commando users transport themselves from place-to-place, this armor might see more usage in the future.\nThe weakness of heavy armor can be mitigated with the right equipment. Use Vitality Booster to increase your health out of even more one-shot ranges (and some two-shot ranges). Stamina Booster can help circumvent slow stamina recovery, and a Jet Pack can be used to mitigate its speed weakness.\n19 B-01 Tactical\nArmor Rating\n| |\n150\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nExtra Padding\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nHelldivers Mobilize Warbond/You start the game with it\n- Armor Rating of a Heavy Armor while still retaining the speed of a medium armor\n- Best used against Automatons\n- Not bad against Terminids, but light weight armor will serve you better\nThe B-01 Tactical and its many variations are surprisingly useful. They're perfect for times when you want Heavy Armor protection without dealing with the Heavy Armor sluggishness.\nThe secret to its surprising success is in its overall Armor Rating. While you retain the speed and stamina regen of a medium armor, you'll also have the same level of protection offered by a heavy armor. This means you can tank a good number of Automaton shots while still scrambling to cover at a decent speed. It's less useful against Terminids where multiple Hunters, Stalkers, and Bile Spewers will work together to tear you apart. As you unlock more armors, you'll get better tools for specific situations and builds (like the prototype armors), but the B-01 Tactical still has some good use cases due to its unique blend of stats.\n18 EX-03 Prototype 3 Armor/ Ex-16 Prototype 16 Armor\nArmor Rating\n| |\n150\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nElectrical Conduit\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nCutting Edge Warbond\n-\nWonderful with teammates who are using the\nArc Throweror other Arc weapons\nAre you tired of being reduced to bloody atoms by your Arc Throwing teammates? The answer to your problems is the Prototype line of Helldiver armor. These suits provide 95% protection against Arc weapons, reducing those deadly Arc bolts down to a luminescent tickle. Additionally, Arc bolts can chain into other targets after striking you, allowing you to go from victim to asset for your Arc throwing buddies.\n[ ](/helldivers-2-eruptor-tips-best-loadout/)\nHelldivers 2's new Democratic Detonation Warbond introduced the Eruptor, a primary weapon that can destroy bug holes and bot fabricators!\n[ Helldivers 2: How To Use The Eruptor Effectively ](/helldivers-2-eruptor-tips-best-loadout/)\nBut the real benefit of this armor is when you and your entire squad suit up in the prototype armors and bring Arc Throwers. Since the Arc Thrower is capable of damaging heavily armored enemies, all of you can focus fire on larger targets to bring them down, while wildly spraying lighting bolts into hordes without any fear of killing teammates. The only downside to this plan is that you'll give up other useful armor passives for this plan, but for how fun and effective this stratagy is, it's still a useful suit of armor to have around when a friend wants to electrocute everything.\nTesla Towers also become safer to use when this armor is equipped, but these turrets still do a small amount of damage and can break limbs despite the armor. This is still preferable to dying.\n17 CE-27 Ground Breaker/SA-12 Servo Assisted\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nServo-assisted\nWhere To Get It\n| |\n- Increased throwing distance lets you safely throw grenades or deploy stratagems onto bases without putting yourself in danger\n- More limb health gives you a little more HP\n- Medium Armor isn't bad for its mix of speed and defence\nThe SA-12 Servo Assisted and CE-27 Ground Breaker armor enjoys a 30% increase in its throw range and 50% more limb health. This means it can throw grenades and stratagems farther than the other armors while still enjoying the balanced benefits of medium armor.\nIt's best used when you want to use stratagems that cover a wide area without the risk of exploding teammates into unhappy bits, or when you want to destroy a base without getting too close and alerting all the enemies inside of it. Stratagems like the Eagle Cluster Bomb, Orbital Airburst, and Orbital Laser will benefit from the extra throwing distance the most since they cover such a wide area. Additionally, the extra throwing distance also makes it much easier to tag enemies with the beacon itself, which can help when you're trying to land a 500KG bomb on a\nBile Titan, an Orbital Precision Strike on a Tank, or tagging a Charger with an EAT-17's calldown pod.\n16 SC-34 Infiltrator\nArmor Rating\n| |\n75\nStamina\n| |\n525\nStamina Regen\n| |\n113\nPassive\n| |\nScout\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nHelldivers Mobilize Warbond\n- The first light armor players get access to\n- Decent speed and stamina regeneration\n- Useful to get comfortable with stealth mechanics\nThe SC-34 is the first light armor you'll unlock in the 'Helldivers Mobilize' War Bond, making it the first light armor everyone has access to. While it has a niche as a high speed, high stamina regen, stealth armor for low-level Helldivers, it still has plenty of uses as a durable Light Armor that's harder to detect than its Medium Armor counterpart. This gives it a small niche for light armor users looking for something a little more durable without sacrificing too much speed while still keeping the Scout passive.\n15 B-08 Light Gunner\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n550\nStamina Regen\n| |\n125\nPassive\n| |\nExtra Padding\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Decent armor rating thanks to Extra Padding\n- All the speed of a light armor with all the protection of a medium armor\n- Armor rating makes it forgiving to use against bots (except against rockets) and speed makes it useful against bugs\nPossessing all the speed of a Light Armor and all the protection of medium armor, the Light Gunner armor is perfect for anyone looking for good protection without sacrificing any of their speed. This can be problematic against headshots, but its unique combination of speed and armor rating make it relevant against both automatons and Terminids. Specifically, this is the perfect armor to use in evacuation missions where you need to run to each button as fast as possible, but you're still in the same general location.\nIts biggest competition is the SC-34 Infiltrator which is the next tankiest Light Armor. While the Infiltrator is the tankiest Scout armor (it's perfect for stealth gameplay while offering more protection than the Trailblazer), the Light Gunner still has its own niche as the most durable Light Armor currently. The Light Gunner is also faster than the Infiltrator armor and has better Stamina Regeneration, making it more useful since the higher speed makes it easier to run away from patrols and it saves time on the mission clock by cutting down travel time without giving up any defense.\n14 SC-37 Legionnaire\nArmor Rating\n| |\n56\nStamina\n| |\n544\nStamina Regen\n| |\n122\nPassive\n| |\nServo-assisted\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Tied with three other armors for the highest speed and stamina regen stats in the game\n- Better against bugs than bots, but has some uses against bots with an Energy Pack\n- Servo-assisted passive helps for using stratagems to clear bases or to throw Impact Grenades further to take down heavy armored elites\nSimilar to the SA-12 Servo Assisted armor, the SC-37 Legionnaire armor enjoys a 30% increase in its throw range. This allows it to stay well away from enemies while still accurately throwing stratagems and grenades. Combined with the Legionnaire armor's high speed and increased limb health, the Helldiver wearing this armor becomes the perfect candidate to run up into range of a base or a nest, unload a few stratagems to clear it, and then run away. If all else fails, the high speed of the Legionnaire armor allows its users to run into the base, throw grenades from a safe distance into bug holes or fabricator vents, and flee for their lives back to a safer location.\nServo-assisted can also help with throwing your mech somewhere safe if you're being chased by a horde of enemies. Use the Legionnaire's speed to run away from your pursuers then make a run for your mech when you get the chance.\n13 FS-38 Eradicator\nArmor Rating\n| |\n56\nStamina\n| |\n550\nStamina Regen\n| |\n125\nPassive\n| |\nFortified\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Tied with Trail Blazer for highest speed and stamina regen stat in the game\n- Fortified allows you to survive a rocket hit without an Energy Shield Pack\n- Best against bots with an Energy Pack but has some uses against bugs at high difficulties\nCurrently, this armor occupies a few useful niches. When combined with a Vitality Booster, this armor will protect you from being body shot by a rocket launcher and sent to the respawn screen. You could even swan dive into an automaton mine and barely survive. As a result, if you leverage your speed to get into cover fast enough and trust that the Fortified passive will save you from explosives where you don't expect it, you'll survive against bots much longer (and more consistently) than other armors. However, its low armor rating also means that the conventional fire power from automaton guns will tear through you with little trouble. Heavy Devastators will be your worst nightmare, so be prepared to handle them whenever they appear.\nIn comparison, the speed and stamina refresh rate allows you to stay ahead of bugs, while Fortified protects you from the explosions of Bile Spewers. While there are better high speed armors to bring against bugs, this isn't a bad option to take if you're also worried about allied explosive weaponry in addition to the few explosives from the Terminids.\n12 DP-40 Champion Of The People/ DP-53 Savior Of The Free\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nDemocracy Protects\nWhere To Get it\n| |\nHelldivers Mobilize Warbond\n- A 50% chance to resist Death is surprisingly useful, just don't rely on it\n- Decent middle-weight armor\n- Great against both factions as long as Democracy Protects triggers\nCurrently, the best armor for staying alive when you shouldn't be. These two armor sets have the same stats and the same passive. They're both middle-weight armors, so they're not the fastest nor the slowest armors you can equip, but their passive, Democracy Protects, gives you a 50% to live through an otherwise lethal hit.\nIf you're not sure what armor to wear for a mission, you can never go wrong with these ones. On the surface, this can be a handy tool to keep you alive through tricky situations, but at the same time, the best usage of this armor is keeping you alive through deaths that were almost unavoidable or through situations that no other armor could have saved you in. Its medium armor stats also give you plenty of additional protection so you can get away or stim in time to survive.\n[ ](/helldivers-2-grenade-pistol-tips-loadout/)\nThe Grenade Pistol has completely upended loadout strategy in Helldivers 2. Here's how to use the powerful secondary weapon effectively.\n[ Helldivers 2: How To Use Grenade Pistol Effectively ](/helldivers-2-grenade-pistol-tips-loadout/)\nHowever, the problem with this armor is the inconsistency of its passive. Relying on a coin-flip to go your way isn't a good strategy, and most of the time having a more reliable passive like Fortified, Scout, or Med-Kit could have served you better. An extra boost of speed and better positioning will also put you in positions where you don't need to rely on this passive as much. Regardless, this armor is still useful as a general way to give yourself more breathing room and to lessen the risk of greedy overcharges with a\nRailgun in Unsafe mode. Combine this with an Energy Shield and you'll truly be a hard-to-kill force to be reckoned without compromising too much speed.\n11 FS-11 Executioner/ FS-05 Marksman/ FS-23 Battle Master\nArmor Rating\n| |\n150\nStamina\n| |\n450\nStamina Regen\n| |\n50\nPassive\n| |\nFortified\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nHelldivers Mobilize Warbond, Page 2\n- Useful budget option for missions against Automatons\n- Keeps you alive through artillery, rockets, or your own explosions\n- Bring a Vitality Booster\nFunctionally, these armors are all the same. They're great, easy-to-obtain options when you need more protection against Automatons and their rocket launchers. Fortified will allow you to tank a missile shot and survive, while the heavy armor rating makes you more resistant to small arms fire. When paired with a vitality booster, you'll be able to tank explosives and survive through damage more consistently.\nThe additional protection against explosives and decent defense against smaller attacks is what makes it a more useful armor against Automatons than an armor like the Fortified Commando. Being able to tank multiple rockets or cannon shots will be worth its weight in gold when you're completing objectives against bots, and while a little bit more maneuverability may be preferred, these armors are still solid choices to take when you want to prioritize survivability over everything else.\nYou can take the Jump Pack to help mitigate the speed loss, or an Energy Shield Pack to further enhance how tanky you are.\n10 CE-35 Trench Engineer/ CE-27 Ground Breaker\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nEngineering Kit\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nHelldivers Mobilize Warbond/ Demolition Democractic Warbond\n- Great for using multiple grenades to bail you out of problems or destroy objectives\n-\nAdditional recoil control can help with special weapons like autocannons and\nAnti-Material Rifles\nBonus grenades are a wonderful boon to have at your disposal. They can get you out of sticky situations, destroy objectives like bug holes, and offer more utility to your team if you're running a smoke or napalm grenade. Impact Grenades can be used to finish off heavy enemies like Bile Titans and even Tanks or Hulks, while 6 Stun Grenades can trivialize large threats when paired with a hard hitting weapon like the Autocannon.\nThe Trench Engineer's medium armor resilience is useful in case you want a little more protection against hordes of enemies. While you'll lack the speed of a light armor, a medium armor's protection will keep you alive through Automaton fire, while the extra grenades can help you fight your way out of bad situations against bugs. Engineering Kit's recoil reduction also gives you a better handle for rapid firing heavy weapons like the the Anti-material rifle.\n9 SA-04 Combat Technician\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nScout\n- Stealthy medium armor\n- Plenty of protection and will get you out of most bad situations\n- A good compromise between speed, armor, and stealth\n- Good against both factions\nThe Scout passive is an extremely powerful tool in Helldivers 2. It lets you sneak into mission objectives, avoid patrols, and scan the map for any nearby threats. Effectively, you're almost always able to react to any enemy spawns at any given moment as long as you keep an eye on the map. With that in mind, the Combat Technician is the most durable of the Scout armors, giving more protection at the cost of the light armor's speed and stamina regen.\n[ ](/helldivers-2-illuminate-faction-explained/)\nThe Illuminate faction is rumored to be returning in Helldivers 2. But just who are they, and why do they hate Democracy so much?\n[ Helldivers 2: Who Are The Illuminate? ](/helldivers-2-illuminate-faction-explained/)\nThe Combat Technician is an amazing armor to use because it provides medium armor levels of protection but with all the sneakiness found in the Infiltrator and Trail Blazer light armors. Against Automatons where speed isn't necessarily the most important stat, having the Combat Technician's improved protection will help you stay alive for much longer against non-critical, smaller attacks. When you're facing off against bugs, having a little bit of extra health against Stalkers or Hunters can be the difference between successfully getting a stim off or begging your friends to reinforce you.\n8 FS-34 Exterminator\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nFortified\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Mid-weight armor that's best used against automatons\n- Besides the Enforcer, only other non-heavy armor with Fortified\n- Has a healthy amount of speed and stamina regen while still protecting you from explosives and small arms fire\nOne of the best armors to use against automatons, the FS-34 Exterminator hits a perfect middle ground among the armors with Fortified. It has more durability than the Eradicator, higher speed than the Enforcer, and for comparison's sake, a more consistently useful passive against bots than Democracy Protects. It's perfect when you need a slightly faster version of the Enforcer without giving up too much Armor Rating.\nSadly, Fortified will not save you from environmental hazards like Meteor Showers.\nThe Exterminator's additional speed is best used to evade hordes of melee automatons. While it's similar to the Enforcer, the extra bit of speed and smart positioning can keep you alive longer than the additional protection offered by the Enforcer. Plus, you'll be able to reach objectives or flee bad situations more comfortably than the Enforcer can.\n7 CM-17 Butcher Armor\nArmor Rating\n| |\n150\nStamina\n| |\n450\nStamina Regen\n| |\n50\nPassive\n| |\nMed-kit\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Become an unkillable god for 4 seconds every time you pop stims\n- Enough Armor Rating to tank through most small hits\n- One of the best armors to use against Automatons on stationary mission objectives\nThe only threat that can kill you during the stim's healing effect are attacks that can one-shot you. While this is more of a worry for light and medium armors, Heavy Armors with a vitality booster can shrug off the majority of body shot attacks. This means, when you combine all the protection of the Heavy Armors with the health regen of the med-kit armors, the result should be a highly durable suit of armor. The Butcher armor is exactly that, sporting enough defenses to survive a majority of threats while also having a built-in panic button in case things go wrong.\nIts high armor rating will protect you from rockets and hard-hitting attacks, while the 4-second health-regen duration allows you to become practically invulnerable for all 4 seconds. This can be an invaluable tool when you need to fight your way out of a situation. However, if you do need to run, using a stim for the Stamina refresh can help overcome the cumbersome slowness of this armor.\nAdditionally, being in Heavy Armor means you're more likely to take more hits because of how much slower you are. This means you'll be popping stims more often to keep yourself above one-shot thresholds, but with 6 stims in reserve, you'll have more than enough to last you until the next resupply drop.\n6 CM-21 Trench Paramedic\nArmor Rating\n| |\n50\nStamina\n| |\n550\nStamina Regen\n| |\n125\nPassive\n| |\nMed-kit\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Heals for the team and additional stims for yourself will let you escape more enemies\n- Surprisingly durable because of additional stims\n- One of the best armors against bugs\nThe Trench Paramedic is the high-speed, light armor variant of the Med-kit armors. Against Terminids, it hits a good niche of survivability, speed, and healing for Helldivers looking for a more lenient way to play the game. Compared to its medium armor versions, the Trench Paramedic gets more value from the increased stim effect duration because the constant healing can counteract the low armor rating of this armor. During that time, the increased speed in the Trench Paramedic armor lets you create more space between yourself and the hordes of enemies that almost killed you.\nThis armor is only okay against Automatons because of its low armor rating, and the ability for rocket bots to one-shot you before you get to use your Stim. The speed and stims are nice to survive through mass automatons shooting at you though.\nHaving an additional two stims is also extremely useful for a light armor. Stray hits and headshots will deal an obnoxious amount of damage to you, which means you'll need to use more Stims to stay at full life so you can safely get to cover when you need to. Additionally, since Stims also recover Stamina, haivng a full stamina bar for light armor means you can escape most dangerous situations extremely quickly.\nThis armor and the other two med-kit armors are also the backbone to support builds if you plan on running a\nSupply Pack with those armors to keep your teammates healed and stocked up on ammo. These builds are more fun than they are effective, but they can be a great way to vary up your build when playing with lower-level friends, especially if you want a break from the tried-and-true meta loadouts.\n5 B-24 Enforcer\nArmor Rating\n| |\n129\nStamina\n| |\n471\nStamina Regen\n| |\n71\nPassive\n| |\nFortified\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Fortified keeps you alive through Automaton rockets\n- Slower than the Exterminator, but with better armor\n- Increased armor rating and Fortified makes it one of the best armors against Automatons\nFortified increases your resistance to explosive damage and further reduces recoil when you're crouched or prone by 30%, but the increased resistance is the real winner here.\nAutomatons can no longer one-shot you with a missile, and allied explosives (like mortar sentries and stratagems) will deal half damage to you, giving you a better chance to survive than you otherwise would have had.

It's slower than its closest competitor, the FS-34 Exterminator, but an additional 29 armor rating will help you tank through more of the Automaton's small arms fire. The only exception is if an automaton shoots your Helldiver in the head, where the additional armor rating doesn't matter at all. But in a realistic usage case where you're most likely scrambing for cover or shooting back while hiding in cover, the extra protection will give you more space to make mistakes and more opportunities to fire back without dying.\n4 CE-74 Breaker\nArmor Rating\n| |\n50\nStamina\n| |\n550\nStamina Regen\n| |\n125\nPassive\n| |\nEngineering Kit\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nSuper Store\n- Tied with Trail Blazer for the highest speed and stamina regen stat in the game\n- Good solo armor because an additional 2 grenades can get you out of trouble or help close up an entire nest by yourself\n- CE-27 Titan Armor is similar, but has a little more Armor Rating at the cost of a little speed, making it better for Automatons than the CE-74 Breaker\nIt is an amazing armor to solo content with if you plan to fight on Terminid controlled worlds. 6 Grenades can be used to clear out a heavy nest or to blast your way out of situations where you're surrounded by bugs. Since it has a high speed and stamina regen stat, you can outrun most enemies and get to each objective at a break-neck pace. Having a surplus of grenades is also great for taking down threats like\nChargers or Bile Spewers, which will take extra damage from grenades (Chargers are vulnerable to explosions directed at their underbellies, and Bile Spewer sacs are also vulnerable to explosions).\nWhile it's better against Terminids, the CE-74 Breaker still has some uses against Automatons if you use your speed to get into cover faster, and bring smoke grenades to cover your retreats or Impact Grenades to handle heavily armored enemies. The Breaker's speed allows you to run circles around tanks and stay ahead of Hulks which can disintegrate Helldivers in seconds with their flamethrowers.\n3 CE-07 Demolition Specialist\nArmor Rating\n| |\n64\nStamina\n| |\n536\nStamina Regen\n| |\n118\nPassive\n| |\nEngineering Kit\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nDemolition Democratic Warbond\n- tanky light weight armor\n- Engineering Kit and high speed is good for bugs and automaton\n- Closest competitor is the CE-74 Breaker\n- Better against Automatons than the CE-74 Breaker\nThe Breaker and the Demolition Specialist occupy the same niche — they're both high speed armors that give you two additional grenades. Since Grenades have become an amazing utility slot thanks to the strength of impact grenades — and the niche usefulness of napalm, smoke, stun, and thermite — these two armors have become even better options for almost any mission you can jump into.\nBetween those two armors, though, the Demolition Specialist trades a little bit of speed and Stamina Regen for a little bit more protection. At face value, that seems like a small change, but against Automatons, where you're more likely to get shot, this armor can help you live through one extra bullet.\nHowever, if you're planning to run weapons that need more breathing room to use (like the\nQuasar Cannon, Arc Thrower, or the HMG) you'll want to use the Breaker's additional speed to stay ahead of the horde. If you're looking for more chances to take shots against enemies, the Demolition Specialist will be superior because you can take an extra shot or two while only giving up a hair bit of speed.\n2 CM-09 Bonesnapper/ CM-14 Physician/ TR-117 Alpha Commander\nArmor Rating\n| |\n100\nStamina\n| |\n500\nStamina Regen\n| |\n100\nPassive\n| |\nMed-kit\n- Great for increasing your own survivability\n- Med-Kit meshes well with medium armor\n- More forgiving than Trench Paramedic\nIf you don't want to be stealthy and don't want to micromanage map markers, the medium Med-kit armors are the two best armors you can use. These two armors have the same stats and the same passive, but the Med-kit passive and medium armor stats make it the most flexible armor in the game currently. Med-kit provides an extra 2 stims and 2 additional seconds to the stim effect's duration. With medium armor, the extra protection gives you more opportunities to survive long enough to stim when enemies are mobbing you, and the extra two seconds of stim's effect means you can fight your way out more safely with less fear of having the stim effect being overwhelmed.\nMed-kit also means you'll always come down with a minimum of 4 stims, even if no one in your squad takes the Hellpod Optimization booster (which can happen since the Vitality booster is so useful). With the Optimization booster, having 6 stims gives you plenty of survivability to achieve objectives and get out of bad situations without fear.\nWhile Med-kit armors are often compared to the Engineering Kit armors because of how useful these two passives are, Med-Kit tends to be the preferred choice for players who are looking for a more forgiving style of play. After all, it's much easier to survive until you find more grenades when you have 6 stims, but it's harder to survive until you find more stims with just 6 grenades.\n1 SC-30 Trailblazer\nArmor Rating\n| |\n56\nStamina\n| |\n544\nStamina Regen\n| |\n122\nPassive\n| |\nScout\nWhere To Get It\n| |\nHelldivers Mobilize Warbond\n- Tied with three other armors for the highest speed and stamina regen stat in the game\n- Scout passive is useful in almost every difficulty\n- Enhanced stealth with light armor makes solo missions easier since enemy patrols will have more difficulty detecting you\n- The best armor to use against Terminids or Stealth play\nThe best armor in the game is still the SC-130 Trail Blazer, but not by much. This armor still suffers from having an extremely low armor rating, which means Helldivers have little room for error when they're using this armor. However, with the high speed and stamina regen in the game, along with one of the best passives available to players, it's very easy to sneak around a map, complete objectives, take out enemies where you need to, and extract without being detected very often.\nHowever, doing so requires constant scans around the map with the Scout armor passive, and for the player to be constantly aware of where to best position themselves so that they're always in cover against bots, or one step ahead of bug swarms.\nBut once this armor is mastered, part of its charm is how it can fit into almost\nany kind of strategy. Scanning for patrols or points of interest when you have the opportunity is incredibly useful in longer missions, regardless of what equipment you're running or how many people you're playing with. In comparison, enhanced stealth allows you to sneak past enemies more easily to complete missions, allowing you to comfortably perform a solo operation if you need to or break away from the main group of Helldivers to complete some out-of-the-way objectives before returning to the main group.
