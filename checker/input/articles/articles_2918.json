(EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Ejército israelí ha llevado a cabo este jueves una nueva oleada de bombardeos contra objetivos del partido-milicia chií libanés Hezbolá en el sur de Líbano en el marco de la campaña intensificada de ataques aéreos contra el país desde el lunes.\nLos ataques han afectado a las localidades de Salaa, Abbasiyé, Tura y Selá, en el distrito de Tiro, ubicado en la gobernación de Líbano Sur. Asimismo, se han registrado otros cuatro bombardeos en Ghaziye, al sur de Beirut, según ha recogido 'L'Orient Le-Jour'.\nPor su parte, Hezbolá ha anunciado en un comunicado que ha atacado la ciudad israelí de Kiriat Ata, situada a pocos kilómetros al este de Haifa, con cerca de 50 misiles, según ha recogido la cadena de televisión libanesa Al Manar, vinculada a la milicia.\nEstados Unidos y Francia hicieron un llamamiento el miércoles a una tregua \"temporal\" de 21 días entre Israel y Hezbolá, si bien el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, ha recalcado este mismo jueves que ha dado orden al Ejército para que continúe \"con todas sus fuerzas\" las operaciones contra el país vecino.\nLeer más acerca de: Líbano Israel",

    "title": "Benazir Bhutto: A real champion of democracy",
    "text": "In a country which except for its first couple of years had always been ruled by its establishment, founder Chairman Pakistan Peoples Party Zulfikar Ali Bhutto proclaimed “democracy is our politics” and “all power to the people” as two of the four of the founding principles of his new party on its foundation day. In spite of all the machinations of the establishment, the PPP defeated all reactionary pro-establishment parties in the elections of 1970 and won with a big majority in what is now Pakistan. A new pole of power, that of the power of the people, was thus created in Pakistan. In the post-Bhutto period, political power has been oscillating between these two poles: the establishment and the people.\nIt is dictatorship when the establishment captures state power, either directly or through proxy parties created by it to block the march of democracy. One distinguishing factor for Pakistan has remained that the establishment has always ruled with the support of Western imperialism, who in the garb of friendship have always been taking military duty from our country. It has been democracy although for limited periods when the forces of the people have asserted their right on state power even after heavily rigged elections.\nQuite a few countries have experienced long periods of military dictatorship and their tyranny after the execution of their democratic leaders with one general succeeding the other. Those aspiring for democracy in Pakistan also faced the worst tyranny after the assassination of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Many went to the gallows and suffered lashes and jails. Some went into hiding. Some others secretly left the country. There was despair and hopelessness. The forces of democracy were all scattered and uprooted. What was happening in Pakistan during military dictatorship was not dissimilar to what had happened in other countries which had faced long military dictatorships.\nYet there was a difference and the difference was young Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed, who in that darkest period of our history stepped forward with commitment, courage and wisdom to lead the democratic movement.\nShe understood that all growing movements are inclusive in essence. One could not lead by dividing the nation. Power of the people lay in their unity. Leading from the front, she set out to collect the scattered workers of her party. She rekindled hope in their hearts. She made them believe that the flow of time and history was towards the future. Dictatorships and their tyranny could not last for ever. The journey towards democracy had to be restarted with unity in their ranks and faith in their hearts. PPP workers responded with a new determination.\nHer next step was to bring other parties together on a common platform of restoration of democracy. Many of these parties had been opposed to Bhutto Shaheed and had provided political support to the military dictator. Yet they were watching that in spite of the dirty maligning propaganda campaign against the PPP and its leadership, public support was with the PPP and Benazir Bhutto. For their own political survival, there was no option left for them but to join the common platform of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD).\nBrave workers of the PPP led by their brave leader Benazir Bhutto gave immense sacrifices in the MRD movement. The MRD did not remove the dictator. But both within and outside the country dictatorship was crippled. Within the country the dictator was no longer feared by the people. Outside the country the movement had made it obvious that people of Pakistan wanted revival of their Constitution and Democracy. The very forces of Western imperialism which had brought and sustained military dictatorship for their own reasons started raising questions on whether it was possible to continue the old policies. The dictator was forced to call general elections to appease his foreign support. In an attempt to fortify his rule through the policy of dividing the nation on multiple fault lines of language, sect, biradri, tribe etc. as also to ward off the danger of a PPP victory, these sham elections were called on a non-party basis. Ground was already slipping from under the feet of dictatorship. The forces of Democracy were making new advances in the leadership of Benazir Bhutto. General elections had to be called in the country after the military dictator was killed in a plane crash. A great damage, however, had already been done by the dictator in the process of appeasing the West in the shape of recruiting non-state militants for the so-called Jihad against Russia.\nThe next 10 years are conspicuous with the establishment resorting to continuous manipulations and conspiracies against the two elected governments of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and their ultimate dismissal by the president and bringing up the PML (N) as their own proxy in the government. This partnership arrangement being devoid of the support of the people had its own internal contradictions, with each of the two partners clamouring for more space in governance. The conflict between the two however did not stop the two PML (N) governments to institute false cases against the PPP leadership and throwing Mr. Zardari and other PPP leaders in jail.\nStatesmanship and commitment to democracy of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto is seen at a climax when she saved the PML (N) government from being dismissed by the president through directing her party’s elected members in the parliament to vote for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, thus taking away the powers of the president to dismiss governments. The next step for strengthening democracy was taken by her when the door to floor crossing was shut with the PPP support to the passage of the 14th Amendment. Saving the PML (N) government on both these occasions by her had been unconditional. To her own party members she explained that the parliament had to be protected against the establishment because ‘democracy was our politics’.\nA power drunk PML (N) government refused to learn its lessons even after its narrow survival. Instead of creating a broad-based consensus for strengthening democracy, they continued with the policy of false cases against the opposition and throwing them in jails. Journalists writing against the government were similarly victimised. The Supreme Court was physically attacked. Two army chiefs were dismissed.\nThe advent of the next military dictator Pervez Musharraf can be seen as nothing but the culmination of the internal growing conflict between the creator and the creation when any reconciliation between the two was no longer possible. However, after a brief term in jail and a court decision against them, the PML (N) leadership soon reached one more compromise with the establishment with the help and arbitration of a third country. They agreed to live abroad for a fixed period leaving a leaderless party behind them. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, who was already leading her party from exile, took over the democratic struggle against the new dictatorship.\nInside Pakistan she was in daily contact with her party leaders and directing them in their struggle. Abroad, she was continuously meeting opinion makers in other countries and giving lectures on the dangers of denial of democracy in Pakistan. She told her audience everywhere that to the existing dangers had now been added new threats from non-state actors in the shape of extremism and terrorism. These non-state actors enjoyed the overt and covert support of our establishment.\nShe realised that it was necessary to bring PML (N) the other major party in the democratic camp for the revival of democracy in Pakistan. The time was ripe since the PML (N) had been stung by the ruling dictatorship. Leaving all grudges behind she moved forward to convince them on the need of reviving democracy in Pakistan. The Charter of Democracy which has resulted in the passage of 18th Amendment under the guidance of President Asif Ali Zardari after her martyrdom was signed between the two parties.\nDemocracy and terrorism cannot coexist. Unfortunately, the denial of democracy for a long period had let her country slip in the expanding grip of terrorism and extremism. Very few understood but she was the one who successfully negotiated a return for PML (N) leadership and herself to Pakistan at great risk to her life to run election campaigns with their respective election manifestoes in order to make the elections meaningful and democracy sustainable in Pakistan.\nIt was this day in 2007, when as the winter sun was setting at Rawalpindi, Benazir Bhutto rose from her vehicle for the last time to respond to the rousing slogans which the people were raising.\nThey stood in all directions as far as one could see. These were people for whose political, economic and social rights she had fought all her life and given her all, for whom she had returned at great risk to her life: her people. For her this was a familiar sight but being amongst her people had always renewed her faith in the destiny and the bright future of her nation. Then suddenly she was no more.\nSomeone said that she could have saved her life if she had not stood up in her vehicle. Perhaps not. These people were her people and she was Benazir Bhutto. A real champion of democracy.",

    "text": "Dialogue Day honors five years of fostering inclusion, conversation TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - A Topeka coffee shop that aims to inspire conversations celebrated a milestone Thursday. Mayor Mike Padilla joined the party and presented a certificate to recognize [Dialogue Coffee House](https://www.dialoguecoffeehouse.com/)’s fifth birthday. Caitlyn Halsey founded Dialogue as a place to celebrate - and employ - people of all abilities. Five years later, they’ve grown from one location with 15 employees to a team of 50 across three shops, with a fourth set to open next month. “I think that the community is starting to see and really highlight the abilities of our staff, and to get to champion them and create authentic connection with our staff and feel those lasting relationships,” Halsey said. Dialogue partnered with [ Capper Foundation](https://www.capper.org/dialogue-coffee-house/) last year. Halsey now serves as Capper’s director of employment services. Erica Peterson has been an employee at Dialogue since they opened. She is one of their lead bakers, churning out delicious cookies, breads, muffins and other treats. \" I get to learn a lot of different skills,” she said. “(I enjoy) working with all the employees, getting to know everybody.” Dialogue’s original location is at SW 29th and Gage. They’re also open at Fellowship Bible Church, SW 10th and Urish; and in Silver Lake. Their fourth location will open in May at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas in downtown Topeka.
