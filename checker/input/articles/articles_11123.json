    "text": "Streaming ATP Miami live tennis\n🎾 Thiago Seyboth Wild vs Quentin Halys\n* You can watch and bet on this match live here..\nSomething big may be brewing in the world of tennis right now, with Federico Cinà being a strong contender to join the list of players called to do important things in the future. At just 17 years old and after reaching his first final in a Challenger tournament, the Italian defeated Comesaña at the Miami Open 2025, achieving some astonishing precocity records.\nTennis runs in his veins, and he can convey sensations of power and a budding champion that are not common in a 17-year-old. Federico Cinà has claimed his first ATP victory at one of the most important stages on the global tennis calendar, the Miami Open 2025. He achieved this win against the current world No. 67, Francisco Comesaña, overcoming untimely cramps when he was one game away from winning the match, after putting forward all the arguments that make him one of the great promises of world tennis.\n- Federico Cinà is the son of a prestigious Italian coach\nWith a much more agile mobility than his notable stature suggests, the Italian is a player of the future in the present, a giant who moves swiftly across the court, executing levers that give unprecedented speed to his shots, while also displaying tactical intelligence and a disposition to endure from the baseline that are unusual for someone his age. He has become the first player born in 2007 to win a match in a Masters 1000, with a record of 10 victories and 1 loss so far this year, ensuring his entry into the top 400 next week.\nFederico CINA'🇮🇹 is the first player born in 2007 to win a match in a 1000 tournament.\n— Luca Brancher (@LucaBeck)[pic.twitter.com/1gdxKPHlVC][March 19, 2025]\nHe breathed in tennis from a young age as the son of Francesco Cinà, who was a coach for years to Roberta Vinci. A renowned coach in Italy, Federico's father owns his own academy in Palermo, the Cinà Tennis Institute, where the young player grew up under the watchful eye of his father. His serve is disruptive, showing offensive will and an outstanding forehand, as well as a very reliable backhand that gives away very little, executing interesting directional changes effortlessly.\n- Cinà is the 15th youngest to win a match in a Masters 1000 in history\nHe has room for improvement in physical aspects and in the power of his shots, but the maturity to manage emotions and tactical intelligence he displays present him as an example of triumphant precocity, suggesting the emergence of a generational talent. Proof of this is that he is the 15th youngest player in history to win his first match in a Masters 1000, achieving it ahead of Alcaraz and just a few days before Sinner and Fonseca did.\nHe will try to enjoy the experience of facing a legend of the current circuit, such as Grigor Dimitrov, who will be his next opponent at the Miami Open 2025. \"I'm exhausted but very happy. I couldn't even move due to cramps, but I kept fighting until the end. I wasn't going to give up. I'm very excited to face Dimitrov,\" stated a Federico Cinà who promises intense emotions on the circuit in the near future.\n📊 Les plus jeunes joueurs au moment de remporter leur premier match en Masters 1000 :\n— Jeu, Set et Maths (@JeuSetMaths)\n🇫🇷 Gasquet - 15 ans et 301 j\n🇪🇸 Nadal - 16 ans et 315 j\n🇷🇴 Pescariu - 17 ans et 10 j\n🇫🇷 Santoro - 17 ans et 97 j\n🇨🇦 Shapovalov - 17 ans et 101 j\n🇷🇺 Rublev - 17 ans et 156 j\n🇺🇸 Roddick - 17 ans…[pic.twitter.com/AMpmPhPvpf][March 19, 2025]\nThis news is an automatic translation.

    "text": "The Montgomery County Asian American Health Initiative (AAHI), a program under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), has awarded $1.5 million in grants to 14 community programs. The funding from the Healthy Communities Fund will support culturally and linguistically appropriate health and social support services for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities in the county.\nThe AAPI community in Montgomery County makes up 15 percent of the population. AAPI residents come from diverse cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds, making tailored health and social support services essential to meet the diverse needs of this community.\nThis is the third year AAHI has administered the Healthy Communities Fund with the Primary Care Coalition (PCC). In past years, AAHI and partner organizations reached more than 15,300 individuals and hosted 835 community events and facilitated over 16,000 hours of volunteer service, valued at more than $400,000.\n“Our County’s diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and it is essential that we support culturally relevant services for our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities,” said County Executive Marc Elrich. “The Healthy Communities Fund is a vital resource that enables us to collaborate with trusted community organizations to deliver services that effectively reach and impact these communities. We are committed to ensuring every resident in Montgomery County has access to meaningful and supportive health care.”\nAAHI introduced several process enhancements to increase equity and strengthen the capabilities of applicant’s this year. The improvements included strategy consultations for interested applicants, an applicant interview phase and consultations with a data expert for awardees to support outcome measurement and reporting. These steps aimed to increase the capacity of organizations to apply, advocate for funding effectively and create systems to track their impact.\n26 proposals were submitted, requesting more than $2.9 million in funding and 14 received grants to provide services from October to June 2025.\nThe following organizations received funding:\nAmerican Diversity Group – $142,260.00 Asian American LEAD – $117,790.84 Chinese American Community Health Services – $123,053.00 Chinese Culture and Community Service Inc. – $149,500.00 Hepatitis B Initiative of Washington, D.C.

    "text": "Ce serait très facile de glorifier Lane Hutson. Le livreur en mobylette est sensationnel, rien de moins.\nIl va rejoindre et dépasser le légendaire Nicklas Lidstrom et devenir le détenteur du record pour le plus grand nombre de mentions d’aide pour un défenseur de première année dans l’histoire de la Ligue nationale de hockey.\nCe sera un peu plus ardu, mais il pourrait rejoindre et dépasser Chris Chelios et devenir la recrue en défense avec le plus grand nombre de points de l’histoire du Canadien de Montréal. Chelios avait amassé 64 points en 1984-1985, et ce, en 74 matchs. Il avait 22 ans et a eu 23 ans en cours de saison. Hutson vient tout juste d’avoir 21 ans...\nBref, je pourrai facilement vous parler de Hutson pendant longtemps. Je pourrais faire de même avec Nick Suzuki, qui a toujours su élever son jeu d’un cran lorsque la situation le commandait et qui encore mardi soir a pris les choses en mains alors que le CH disputait un match horrible après 40 minutes de jeu.\nSuzuki a sonné la charge en troisième période, récoltant au passage le but vainqueur. Bravo à Martin St-Louis pour la présence du capitaine sur la deuxième vague de jeu de puissance. Que Martin l’a fait exprès ou non, bravo à Martin.\nAvec le Storm de Guelph en 2019, Suzuki a été exceptionnel, notamment face au Spirit de Saginaw en demi-finale. Le Storm tirait de l’arrière 3 à 1 dans la série et Nick a montré le chemin en route vers un gain en sept et un championnat remporté lors de la finale. Suzuki a cumulé 42 points, dont 24 buts en 28 matchs, lors des séries de la OHL en 2019 et Marc Bergevin se pinçait pour être certain de ne pas rêver, lui qui privilégiait obtenir Cody Glass des Golden Knights de Vegas dans la transaction impliquant Max Pacioretty. Bergevin se trompait royalement, mais le DG des Knights aussi.\nIl me serait très facile de vous parler de Suzuki, de Cole Caufield, de Samuel Montembeault, de Hutson ou encore de St-Louis, qui ne reçoit vraiment pas assez de crédit pour les succès du Canadien actuellement. J’ai plutôt envie de vous parler de Josh Anderson, le futur gagnant du trophée Jacques-Beauchamps remis à la quatrième étoile de la saison chez le Tricolore. Il ne l’aura pas volé. L’impact d’Anderson sur le groupe de joueurs du CH est exponentiel cette saison.\nVoilà un gars qui était tout mêlé depuis très longtemps. Il était perdu dans les demandes et les schémas de son coach, en plus d’être malheureux au milieu d’un groupe dans lequel il ne se reconnaissait plus.\nUn ailier de puissance en totale perte de confiance, impuissant devant son incapacité de comprendre ou voulait aller St-Louis et déprimé devant le constat qu’il n’eût pas ce qu’il fallait pour faire œuvre utile. Anderson, dont on voulait tous voir le contrat racheté l’été dernier. J’ai d’ailleurs été le premier déçu de constater que ce vulgaire boulet se présentait au tournoi de golf de l’équipe.\nJe peux maintenant affirmer que je ne me passerais pas d’Anderson et que tout le crédit revient d’abord à Anderson lui-même. Le gars s’est pris en mains et a décidé d’essayer vraiment.\nAnderson a donc écouté et il s’est ajusté. Crédit second, mais total au coach qui a trouvé les mots et qui est entré sous la peau d’Anderson, ce qui semblait être une mission impossible avant cette saison.\nSt-Louis a ensuite trouvé une combinaison parfaite. Le trio des trois boulets, Dvorak, Gallagher et Anderson, est devenu le trio le plus constant et le plus fiable du CH. Un troisième trio qui dans les faits est un excellent deuxième trio dans cette saison de transition, de «mi » qui est en train de se transformer en saison de rêve.\nAnderson aime tellement ce qui se passe qu’il endure. Son seuil de tolérance à la douleur lui mérite honneurs et distinctions. C’est Anderson en 2025, comme c’était Shea Weber en 2021.\nUn gars démonté, disloqué, magané pas mal plus que Dave dans Slap Shot. Anderson a besoin de deux à quatre heures de traitement par jour, qu’il y ait match ou non. Il encaisse avec bonheur et plaisir. Il est heureux et veut faire partie de la belle histoire.\nAnderson est inspirant et ses coéquipiers se servent de lui pour mieux rêver éveillés, pour mieux avancer. Quand il est entré tête première dans la bande, je me suis dit : «Ça y est, il est mort». Pourtant en troisième période, il était de retour au banc. Anderson a tout mon respect et je m’excuse de m’être emporté contre lui, c’est un vrai guerrier!",

    "text": "GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - When emergency events take place, phone service could be dropped across the Coast. The Mississippi Coast Amateur Radio Association (MCARA) is prepared for that exact scenario. On Saturday, members of the MCARA practiced setting up and making communications as part of a field day. “We take time to share our knowledge and develop relationships in case you need them later on, perhaps in an emergency,” said MCARA coordinator Steven Harrison. Hurricanes are an example of when ham radio communication is critical. “If you remember Hurricane Katrina, I was on my roof with my cell phone holding it up in the air trying to get in touch with anybody,” explains Harrison. “With ham radio, all you have to do is pull your radio out and call, and a group like this is going to have somebody listening.” Other groups like this around the country are also taking part in the 24-hour field day activity to make as many contacts as possible. “We’ve made contacts so far with groups in Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and as far as Oregon,” Harrison said. While radio communication can be important in an emergency, it’s also a fun hobby. “Ham radio is communicating not using your telephone or wires and radio frequencies,” said Harrison. “When you were younger, you might have used walkie-talkies too. Ham radio is for people who want to buy more capable, probably more expensive walkie-talkies. It’s fun to be able to do that and say, ‘Yeah, I can talk to the world.’” The field day event continues until Sunday afternoon.
