    "title": "What does 12/31/23 mean? The last day of 2023 is an angel number",
    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests.\nIf you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported.\nThe once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "text": "Digital Media Pad prototype The healthcare landscape is constantly evolving, demanding innovative solutions to address challenges faced by patients and medical professionals alike. In this pursuit of progress, health resources and strategy leader Ela Vashishtha has emerged as a pioneer, spearheading the development of a groundbreaking invention: the Digital Medical Pad. More than just a technological innovation, this patented device embodies Ms. Vashishtha's deep understanding of healthcare complexities, honed through her vast experience managing a $3 billion portfolio and driving data-driven initiatives across 25+ hospitals in her state of residency. This expertise shines through in every facet of the Digital Medical Pad, designed to address critical issues plaguing healthcare systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Secure Access, Streamlined Processes At the heart of the invention lies a secure biometric scanner. Gone are the days of misplaced charts and stolen identities; fingerprints grant authorized personnel instant access to a patient's medical history, ensuring both privacy and efficient care delivery. Medication management takes a leap forward with the pad's ability to display medication history and facilitate digital order creation. This not only reduces waiting times but also minimizes errors and potential drug interactions. Real-Time Intelligence Powering Decisions The Digital Medical Pad transcends mere data storage. Embedded AI and machine learning algorithms work synergistically with real-time data to empower healthcare professionals. Imagine a scenario where a doctor, upon entering a patient's fever symptom, receives treatment suggestions tailored to the patient's unique medical profile, considering factors like co-existing conditions and potential allergies. This level of real-time decision support enhances diagnostic accuracy and optimizes treatment plans, paving the way for personalized, effective care. Bridging the Global Healthcare Divide Ms. Vashishtha's vision extends beyond borders. Recognizing the immense potential of the Digital Medical Pad in resource-limited countries, she is leading the charge in adapting the technology for these specific contexts. The device's affordability and portability make it ideal for rural areas, where access to quality healthcare has traditionally been limited. By eliminating paper records and cumbersome processes, the pad promises to revolutionize care delivery in underprivileged regions, democratizing access to crucial medical information and services. Partnerships for Progress The journey towards widespread adoption of the Digital Medical Pad is underway. Ms. Vashishtha is actively seeking partnerships with multiple entities in India, aiming to pilot the device in rural areas and smaller cities.

Currently, she is partnering with and providing strategic advice on product advancement ideas, market strategies, future iterations of testing the pad in Indian healthcare market. A Beacon of Hope Ela Vashishtha's Digital Medical Pad opens the possibility of a future where healthcare is accessible, efficient, and personalized in developing and developed worlds alike. By harnessing the power of technology and focusing on real-world needs, Ms. Vashishtha is trying to forge a path towards a healthier, more equitable world. This innovation holds the potential to bridge healthcare divides, empower medical professionals, and improve the lives of millions, making it a truly transformative force in the global healthcare landscape.

    "text": "La guerra en el sur del Líbano o en el norte de Israel, como quiera que se le denomine, ha empezado. ¿O no había terminado nunca desde hace décadas? A lo que no se llama todavía inicio de la guerra —¿qué otra cosa falta?— es al bombardeo masivo de la aviación israelí y a la intensificación de las ráfagas de misiles de Hezbollah hacia objetivos situados cada vez más hacia el sur de Israel.\nEl intercambio de fuego casi ritual, intermitente, en la llamada línea azul fronteriza, alcanzó después del 7 de octubre pasado una intensidad creciente día por día, con un resultado inevitable: el desplazamiento en gran escala de los habitantes del norte de Israel, unos 60 mil, hacia el sur, y de unos cien mil libaneses del sur del Líbano, hacia el norte.\nEste ha sido el argumento de Benjamin Netanyahu para justificar lo que llama la segunda fase de su guerra. La primera, inconclusa y aparentemente olvidada, ha sido el enfrentamiento con Hamás en Gaza, pero sin cumplir su promesa de hacer desaparecer a la organización palestina, sino después de arrasar ciudades casi completas y de matar a más de 41 mil palestinos, entre ellos gran cantidad de mujeres, niños y hombres inocentes. Ahora ha emprendido otra fase, mucho más complicada.\nLos acontecimientos de los últimos días evidencian una vertiginosa escalada.\nUna vieja cuenta\nRetrocedamos al pasado 30 de julio. Ese día, en una operación al mejor estilo del Mossad, estalló un explosivo en el lugar donde se encontraba Fouad Shukr, un veterano dirigente de la rama militar de la organización chiíta libanesa.\nYa no era un dirigente palestino. Habían abierto la vieja cuenta entre Israel y Hezbollah.\nEl 25 de agosto, Hezbollah respondió con bombardeos coheteriles contra varias instalaciones militares israelíes, cuarteles y los sistemas de defensa antimisiles Domo de Hierro, en el norte de Israel. Pero sobre todo contra un importante emplazamiento de la inteligencia tecnológica israelí, la base Gilot, cercana a Tel Aviv.\nLa base Gilot es una instalación que apoya las operaciones de la Unidad 8200, una importante división de las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel, con funciones similares a las de la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional de los Estados Unidos. En la versión israelí, el ataque no tuvo consecuencias. Hezbollah afirma haber causado daños físicos y humanos en la instalación. Se habría alcanzado un objetivo muy sensible.\nCasi de inmediato, un centenar de aviones de combate israelíes llevaron a cabo ataques en el sur del Líbano, en el mayor bombardeo desde el 7 de octubre pasado. La escalada militar y la retórica han continuado acrecentándose.\nIsrael ha seguido concentrando fuerzas y medios blindados en el norte de Galilea.\nEl 17 de septiembre ocurrió uno de los hechos más estremecedores e inexplicables de este viejo duelo. Estremecedor por su crueldad e inexplicable por el momento en que se produjo. A una hora precisa, estuvieran donde estuvieran, en manos de sus usuarios, en un mueble cerca de un niño o en el bolsillo de cualquier persona, más lejanos o más cercanos a su propietario, seis mil beepers suministrados por una oscura firma tecnológica, estallaron simultáneamente en el Líbano. Al día siguiente fue el turno de los walkie talkies. El saldo de la criminal operación: al menos 12 muertos y 3000 heridos.\nCasi 23 años antes, el ciudadano británico jamaiquino Robert Reid había sido detenido por los tripulantes del vuelo 63 de American Airlines, que se dirigía de París a Miami, cuando se detectó que iba a detonar un explosivo plástico insertado en el tacón de su zapato.\nEn la operación hubieran muerto los 196 pasajeros y tripulantes del avión, ajenos a las motivaciones de Reid, militante del Estado Islámico.\nReid cumple hoy tres condenas a cadena perpetua más 110 años en la cárcel de máxima seguridad ADX Florence en Colorado, conocida como “Supermax”. Esta instalación alberga a algunos de los criminales más peligrosos de Estados Unidos.\nTerrorismo puro y duro\nSin embargo, los medios informativos occidentales no han llamado terrorista a la acción de Israel. Más bien han destacado su supuesta eficacia. Aunque el rechazo en las Naciones Unidas ha sido casi total, en los medios de prensa occidentales no aparece el calificativo de “terrorismo” para referirse a estas acciones.\nDos días después, un ataque aéreo contra un edificio de Beirut dejó también un saldo copioso de víctimas. El objetivo en este caso fue una de las figuras veteranas de Hezbollah, Ibrahim Aqil. Junto con él murieron más de treinta personas que habitaban en el mismo edificio.\nPensé que la guerra ya había comenzado. Sobre todo después de que Israel aprovechara su gran predominio aéreo para lanzar un nuevo y más poderoso bombardeo masivo, lo que se conoce como carpet-bombing o bombardeo en alfombra, mientras Hezbollah disparaba una lluvia de cohetes hacia el territorio israelí, golpeando objetivos tanto en el norte como en el centro.\nSegún las fuentes, los bombardeos israelíes no buscan tanto destruir objetivos militares como localizarlos. Ghassam Salameh, ex ministro de Cultura libanés y residente en París hoy, aprecia además de la superioridad aérea, otro recurso a favor de Israel:\n“El ejército israelí también podría mostrar su hegemonía tecnológica mediante el uso de la inteligencia artificial, algo que ya está haciendo masivamente en Gaza, para el reconocimiento facial o en asesinatos selectivos en el sur del Líbano. Los programas de big data e inteligencia artificial permiten a Israel contraer el tiempo. El tiempo entre la capacidad de identificar un objetivo y la capacidad de atacarlo se ha vuelto extremadamente corto …”\nNo son divulgados los resultados de la cohetería libanesa. Las Fuerzas de Defensa Israelíes han impuesto una censura absoluta sobre todas las noticias provenientes de esta región.\nNo obstante, se filtran videos e informaciones que indicarían que no solamente están provocando la destrucción de objetivos a 60 kilómetros de profundidad, sino alcanzando zonas estratégicas, como el puerto de Haifa. “Los israelíes (del norte del país) estaban en los refugios; ha habido una gran destrucción”, dijo el veterano diplomático británico Alastair Crooke, conocedor de primera mano de la región en una entrevista.\nEntre tanto, la concentración de medios y fuerzas de las Fuerzas de Defensa Israelíes en la frontera anuncian un nuevo paso: la invasión terrestre al Líbano. Es decir, la invasión del estado de Israel, una vez más, a otro estado soberano.\nA nadie le conviene\nPero ninguna de las partes asume que ya hay una guerra. Israel insiste en que su objetivo es el repliegue de Hezbollah más allá del río Litani, a casi treinta kilómetros al norte de la frontera.\nPara Hezbollah sus acciones se detendrían solo si se alcanzara un acuerdo justo en Gaza. Netanyahu no quiere ningún acuerdo.\nEl pasado 24 de septiembre un éxodo de libaneses del sur atestaban las carreteras emigrando hacia el norte del país, y casi un millón de israelíes se protegen en refugios antiaéreos, el norte y en el centro del país.\nEn el Líbano han muerto a causa de los bombardeos unas 550 personas, la tercera parte mujeres y niños. En comparación, en toda la guerra del 2006, que duró más de un mes, murieron 1600 personas.\nEs de prever que la aviación israelí, que tiene más de 750 aviones, casi todos de combate, mantenga su bombardeo y su presión sobre las supuestas posiciones de Hezbollah, sin preocuparse por las bajas civiles.\nTampoco es improbable la entrada en acción del ejército por tierra. Pero en este caso, la guerra de 2006 será también una referencia diferente.\nEl ejército de Hezbollah estaría combatiendo en un teatro de operaciones muy estudiado y perfeccionado. Más de 2 mil combatientes de la organización adquirieron una intensa experiencia combativa en la guerra civil de Siria, donde contribuyeron a la consolidación de las fuerzas del presidente Bachar el Assad.\nLas cifras totales de soldados de Hezbollah varían mucho según la fuente, pero nadie las calcula en menos de 20 mil.\n¿Para quién es útil esta guerra?\nEl principal beneficiado de esta guerra es Benjamin Netanyahu. Esta confrontación forma parte de su huida hacia adelante, que le permite seguir estirando la duración de su gobierno y escapar a su cita con los tribunales, en los que le espera una causa por corrupción.\nPor supuesto que incluyo en esto a los sectores ultraortodoxos que integran y apuntalan su mayoría parlamentaria y que ejercen una influencia significativa sobre las políticas del gobierno de Netanyahu, especialmente en temas de seguridad y en el conflicto con los palestinos.\nIrán y Hezbollah no tenían interés en la expansión de las operaciones, y han dado muestras de una gran capacidad de contención frente a las acciones contra sus dirigentes. En particular, Hezbollah recibirá el reconocimiento y la solidaridad de quienes coinciden con su identificación con la causa palestina.\nPero el Líbano es un país muy complejo, fragmentado y contradictorio, y la guerra reanimará opiniones y sentimientos encontrados, desde siempre, respecto a la situación regional.\nLa vieja Europa, de vínculos tradicionales con la región, en particular el Reino Unido y Francia, se encuentra demasiado involucrada en la guerra entre Ucrania y Rusia, y con complejos problemas internos, varios de los cuales comprometen seriamente el futuro de sus sociedades. Su actuación diplomática hasta hoy ha tendido a llamar a la paz. Cuna de la declaración de los Derechos del Hombre, tendría que condenar la crueldad demostrada por el Estado de Israel.\nRusia tiene que considerar su estrecha relación con Siria y sobre todo con Irán, pero también con Israel, pese a que ha vivido momentos mejores que los actuales, cuando Netanyahu ha pasado del elogio al insulto contra el presidente Putin.\nChina, la gran potencia, está implementando sus primeras políticas hacia la zona, al promover iniciativas como las relaciones entre Irán y Arabia Saudita, o al convocar a reuniones de unidad entre las organizaciones palestinas.\nEl resto del mundo árabe, aún en su diversidad, probablemente no irá más allá de las posiciones recientemente reiteradas por la Liga Árabe sobre la cuestión palestina. El escenario bélico podría cuestionar los intereses de varios de sus integrantes.\nSalameh, en la entrevista citada, lo dice con especial crudeza: “En los últimos cincuenta años, ha habido una especie de desarabización de la naturaleza del conflicto (con Israel) y una apropiación palestina del mismo. Por lo tanto, no es sorprendente la actitud actual de los gobiernos árabes: han pasado cincuenta años desde que se distanciaron (de la causa palestina)”.\nFinalmente, el gran patrón, la gran potencia con mayores intereses en la región, no ha dejado de apoyar a Israel y lo seguirá haciendo. Pero no hay duda de que Joe Biden, al menos, ha encontrado en Netanyahu un socio molesto y altanero, que no ha dudado en boicotear a los negociadores estadounidenses en busca de un alto el fuego en Gaza.\nY, esto, en la fase culminante de sus elecciones presidenciales.\nLa gran noticia para Netanyahu sería la expansión regional de la guerra, que obligaría a Estados Unidos a involucrarse en ella. Porque no nos olvidemos: para Israel, el verdadero objetivo es Irán, y contra Irán no puede ir solo. Eso querría, para, luego, tranquilamente, seguir expandiendo sus relaciones con el mundo árabe, como en los dorados tiempos de Donald Trump.\nAntes de ser electo primer ministro por enésima vez, Netanyahu había afirmado: “Los palestinos son el uno por ciento de los árabes. rimero me voy a entender con el 99 por ciento restante y, cuando haya terminado, me ocuparé de ellos”.\nLa historia se ha encargado de invertir el orden.",
