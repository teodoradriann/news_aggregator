    "title": "Accra's Leap Towards Sustainable Waste Management",
    "text": "In the heart of Accra, a significant stride towards enhancing the city's waste management and recycling efforts has taken place, setting a new precedent for the industry. Elizabeth Naa Kwatsoe Sackey, the Mayor of Accra, has recently commended J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited for its substantial investment in acquiring three cutting-edge waste management vehicles. This move, according to the Mayor, is not just a step forward for the company but a leap towards a cleaner, more sustainable Accra.\nInnovative Steps Towards Cleaner Urban Living\nAt a ceremony held in the bustling streets of Accra, Mayor Sackey highlighted the importance of modern and efficient fleet vehicles in revolutionizing waste management services. \"These new vehicles are not merely additions to the company's fleet; they are the bearers of change,\" she stated, emphasizing how such advancements are crucial in the fight against sanitation-related challenges and climate change. The Mayor's speech was a clarion call to other waste management firms, urging them to follow suit and elevate the industry's standards through competition and innovation.\nFurthermore, the Mayor underscored the Assembly's dedication to transforming Accra into a clean and livable city. Initiatives such as the Street Sweepers Initiative, the CLEAN project, and the ambitious Zero Waste Street demonstrate a concerted effort to not only beautify the city but also engage its residents in sustainable waste management practices. \"Our vision is a city where every resident plays a part in maintaining cleanliness,\" Mayor Sackey remarked, stressing the importance of community involvement in achieving these goals.\nCollaborative Efforts and Future Plans\nJoshua Abrako Darko, the General Manager responsible for Finance and Administration at J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited, shared insights into the company's future plans. \"Our goal is to establish landfills in all sixteen regions of Ghana, significantly improving waste treatment and disposal,\" he revealed. This ambitious plan, coupled with the deployment of the new vehicles within the Okaikoi South Sub-Metropolitan District (excluding the Bubui Electoral Area), promises to enhance waste collection efficiency and recycling efforts across the city.\nThe Mayor also called on the residents of Accra to cooperate with accredited waste management companies for recycling, highlighting the critical role public participation plays in achieving a sustainable urban environment. \"It is through our collective efforts that we can combat the menace of waste and embrace recycling as a way of life,\" she added, encouraging residents to see themselves as active agents of change in their community.\nA Turning Point in Urban Waste Management\nThe collaboration between the Accra Metropolitan Assembly and private sector players like J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited marks a turning point in the city's approach to waste management. By embracing advanced technologies and fostering competition within the industry, Accra sets an example for other cities to follow. The acquisition of new fleet vehicles by J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited is a testament to the company's commitment to environmental stewardship and a reflection of the growing awareness of the importance of efficient waste management in urban settings.\nIn conclusion, the commendation of J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited by Mayor Elizabeth Naa Kwatsoe Sackey is more than a ceremonial gesture; it is an acknowledgment of the critical role that modern infrastructure and collaborative efforts play in enhancing urban waste management. As Accra continues to implement innovative solutions and engage its residents in sustainable practices, the vision of a clean, livable city becomes increasingly attainable. This initiative not only signifies progress in waste management but also reinforces the connection between urban sanitation and the broader environmental challenges posed by climate change. Through such endeavors, Accra is paving the way for a sustainable future, demonstrating that effective waste management is both a civic responsibility and a cornerstone of environmental conservation.",

    "title": "Is AI ignoring consent and harming users?",
    "text": "By Aayush Agarwal, Darshil Shah & Pavan Mamidi\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping our digital world, unlocking opportunities while sparking ethical debates. As forms collect data under the guise of “informed” consent, they draw lucrative inferences about our attitudes and behaviours, often without our full understanding. This information asymmetry between users and firms raises questions about the ethics of data hoarding. Furthermore, clever design elements nudge us into sharing more than we realise, leaving us vulnerable to exploitation. The complexities of these issues urge us to take a closer look at the balance between innovation and ethical responsibility.\nIs consent really “informed” if users don’t know the extent of the inferences drawn by firms? Within AI and digital markets, informed consent is a prerequisite between users and firms that allows firms to extract user data in exchange for the digital service, which is often free, resulting in a non-price transaction with data as currency. Two aspects of legal consent are unique to digital markets: (a) whether users are adequately informed about the amount of their data that firms will collect (if there exists low awareness, the contract is imperfect, and the value derived by one party is greater than the other, resulting in user exploitation); and (b) whether users are informed of the breadth and depth of inferences drawn by digital firms about their users using their data. In (b), if users are unaware that their data will be used outside of the purposes of firms’ immediate service, perhaps to gain a competitive advantage in an adjacent market, serious consumer welfare and competition concerns arise. For instance, Netflix has leveraged users’ viewing data to enhance the development of Netflix-produced content. This practice challenges the foundational ethics of data use, as users inadvertently contribute to other markets.\nWhy are people who are concerned about the privacy of their data doing little to actually protect their privacy? Surveys show that people do not fully comprehend key concepts described in privacy policies. Moreover, they report feeling coerced by online platforms into accepting these policies (Bashir et al., 2015). Users do not know enough about what they consent to when using digital services, which goes against major international regulations calling upon digital firms to make it easier for users to make informed decisions. As of 2021, 137 out of 194 countries had enforced data protection and privacy legislation (UNCTAD, 2021). By creating informational asymmetry and undermining informed consent, digital firms may be not compliant with most of these countries’ regulations.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) definition of consent distinguishes “freely given consent” from consent under any form of pressure. Digital platforms like Instagram design user choices, subtly guiding interactions toward profit-centric goals. This persistent nudging compromises user autonomy.\nDigital platforms employ sophisticated design elements to create an illusion of user control over their data while nudging them towards choices that may not align with their best interests. For example, Facebook and Instagram offer users various privacy settings and controls, giving them the perception of having control over their data. However, these settings may be complex and difficult to navigate, leading users to default to the platform’s pre-selected options, which favour data collection and sharing. Moreover, platforms utilise behavioural science techniques to nudge users towards actions that benefit the platform’s bottom line. One such technique is confirm-shaming, where users are subtly coerced into accepting data collection policies by framing privacy-conscious choices as inconvenient or socially undesirable.\nNavigating these ethical complexities necessitates a pivot not just towards prioritising consumer welfare but redefining it. Upholding user welfare should mean securing consent and ensuring user data isn’t exploited for undisclosed, intricate inferences. It involves safeguarding the integrity of user choice and curbing persistent nudges towards profit-driven objectives that distort genuine user experiences. Policy initiatives like the European Union’s AI Act and GDPR have set commendable benchmarks in protecting privacy and user data control. The GDPR grants individuals greater control over personal data, requires explicit consent before collecting and using their data, and imposes strict data security measures. However, the ethical challenges posed by inferred preferences and choice architectures demand a broader conversation.\nIndia has taken steps to safeguard digital consumer welfare with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, and the Digital Competition Bill (DCB). The DPDP Act mandates that consent must be free, informed, specific, and clear by enforcing stricter transparency requirements. Similar to the GDPR, it attempts to reduce information asymmetry over data usage between users and firms. The DCB could promote fair competition while addressing monopolistic behaviour like rent-seeking and data hoarding. Both legislations emphasise accountability and transparency from digital firms about their data practices and competitive behaviours. If the DCB is enacted, in conjunction with the DPDP Act, they can foster a more ethical AI ecosystem in India by empowering users with better control over their personal information.\nRegulatory agencies like the Competition Commission of India are crucial in enforcing these laws and holding firms accountable for violations. Safeguarding digital consumers requires a multi-faceted approach encompassing legal, regulatory, and enforcement measures.\nAI systems delving beyond explicit user consent should mandatorily disclose and seek consent for these extended uses. Simultaneously, crafting digital frameworks that prioritise user autonomy over commercial gains holds significance. Ethical AI development demands user-centric designs that respect users’ original objectives, nurturing genuine interactions devoid of coercive nudges towards profit-oriented goals.\nThe writers are respectively senior associate and lab manager, research associate, and director, Centre for Social and Behaviour Change, Ashoka University .\nDisclaimer: Views expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of FinancialExpress.com .

This is a person without identity documents and whose age is estimated between 20 and 30 years old, he said.\nThe man was transported in serious condition to Henri-Mondor hospital in Créteil, according to the prosecution, which specified that the air transport gendarmerie (GTA) was in charge of the investigation.\nEarlier Thursday, an airport source explained that the young man was “alive but in absolute emergency because of severe hypothermia”. The GTA has confirmed a “seriously injured person” at Orly, without further details immediately.\nA mortality rate of 77%\nSeveral cases of stowaways hidden in the landing gear of planes, unheated or pressurized spaces, have marked the news in recent years. In April, the body of a man was found at Amsterdam-Schiphol upon the arrival of a plane from Toronto (Canada), but apparently had previously passed through Nigeria. Four months earlier, two stowaways, also dead, were discovered hidden in the storage space of the landing gear of a plane coming from Santiago de Chile to Bogota.\nAt the cruising altitude of commercial aircraft, 12 kilometers, the air temperature plunges below −50°C, while the lack of oxygen can be fatal.\nAccording to global statistics from the American Civil Aviation Authority (FAA) cited in January 2022 by the New York Times, between 1947 and 2021, 132 people attempted to travel clandestinely by hiding in airplane landing gears. One hundred and two of them died, a mortality rate of 77%, according to the same source.\n1703803929\n#man #landing #gear #plane #Orly",

    "title": "\"La Abadía de Montserrat forzó a mis padres para que no denunciase por el bien de la Iglesia\"",
    "text": "“Abusaron de mí cuando era un adolescente. Mi agresor fundó el grupo de scouts y durante ese tiempo abusó de 12 menores”. Es el testimonio de Miguel Hurtado (Barcelona, 1982), víctima de abusos sexuales por parte de la Iglesia Católica cuando tenía 16 años.\nEl catalán relata a este medio el horror que vivió siendo tan solo un adolescente por culpa de aquel monje benedictino, Germa Andreu, y lo que es peor, la sensación de soledad cuando se atrevió a contarlo. Porque él, a diferencia de muchas otras víctimas a las que el miedo les imposibilita denunciar, sí se vio capaz, pero fue como darse de bruces contra un muro. “Se lo dije a la propia abadía y reaccionó como suele reaccionar la jerarquía católica: encubriendo, sin avisar a la justicia ni a los padres y, por supuesto, eludiendo de buscar otras víctimas”, lamenta.\nDe hecho, sus padres “sí se habían quejado”, pero los poderes eclesiásticos, aprovechando la condición religiosa de los progenitores, les presionaron para que la cosa se quedara ahí: “Intentaron llamarlos y persuadirles, convenciéndoles de que por el bien de la Iglesia y de todos lo mejor era gestionarlo internamente, sin que la justicia se enterase (…) No tuve apoyo de la familia, ni de la institución”.\n“La gente tiene miedo de denunciar. A nadie le gusta ser el primero”\nCon esta situación, intentó seguir con su vida “como buenamente pudo”, hasta que ve la luz la investigación de los periodistas de The Boston Globe que destapa multitud de casos en Estados Unidos y que muchos lectores conocerán por la película Spotlight. Entonces habla con su abogada, pero no pudieron hacer nada porque el delito estaba prescrito. Después, intentó continuar: se fue a Londres y estudió Medicina.\nSin embargo, algo no estaba bien dentro de él, no solo a título individual, sino también colectivo, y se dio cuenta de que contarlo podía ayudar -tal y como sucedió- a que otras víctimas dieran el paso. “En 2019 denuncié públicamente mi historia en medios de comunicación. Fui pionero, sí, pero porque en estos casos la gente tiene miedo, a nadie le suele gustar ser el primero”.\nAsí lo demuestran los estudios. Los mismos que el Parlament de Catalunya aceptó para el pasado miércoles votar a favor de\nelevar la cuestión al Congreso, y que muestran, entre otras cosas, cómo muchas víctimas no dan el primer paso hasta que cumplen 50 años. Asimismo, Europa, la ONU y otros organismos advierten de la importancia de modificar el Código Penal para equiparar España con otros 32 países que ya han aprobado la imprescriptibilidad de los delitos de pederastia. “Hasta que no denuncia mucha más gente, la Abadía no reconoce en una comisión de investigación que este hombre había abusado de 12 menores (…) Y a pesar de todo, no ha pasado ni un día en prisión”.\nUn camino pedregoso por la Justicia\nEn 2020, Hurtado narra su experiencia en El manual del silencio, un libro que llega después de la derogación del secreto pontificio por parte del Papa Francisco, que supuso un gran paso para el reconocimiento de las víctimas y la aplicación de la justicia para los pederastas que habían sido protegidos durante años; algo que iba categóricamente en contra del modus operandi de opacidad que se había dado bajo el liderazgo eclesiástico de Benedicto XVI, y no digamos antes.\nCada página y cada testimonio es más duro que el anterior, desde ese silencio cómplice de la guardia pretoriana de la Iglesia o la entidad misma, hasta el pretexto bajo el que justificó actuar el cura. En el manual expone otras cuestiones demoledoras, como que el responsable de los scouts justificaba los abusos para “ayudarle a cursarse” de su posible homosexualidad; y pregunta. “Si los padres no pueden enviar con tranquilidad a sus hijos a Montserrat, ¿adónde pueden mandarles?”. “Tu madre quiere llevarte al psiquiatra para curar tu posible homosexualidad, tu padre quiere llevarte de putas para que te conviertas en un hombre, y el rarito eres tú”. Una radiografía tan dura como acertada de la España todavía rancia de los 90.\nDespués de publicar el libro, en 2021 consiguió que el Congreso ampliara en 17 años el plazo de tiempo que las víctimas de pederastia tienen para denunciar. Un avance vital, aunque poco menos que un “parche legislativo”. De ahí que el objetivo último para con los delitos de pederastia sea el que se ha expuesto: “Fue un avance importante, sí, pero una ley mediocre que no tiene en cuenta ni la evidencia científica, ni el derecho comparado ni las recomendaciones de organismos internacionales. Pedimos la total imprescriptibilidad”.\nEn octubre del año pasado valoró el informe sobre la pederastia en el Vaticano elaborado por el Defensor del Pueblo. En aquel momento puso de manifiesto que el organismo no había tenido acceso a los archivos y que había sido la Santa Sede -la misma que había encubierto casos durante años- la que había mirado los documentos.\nAhora, en su lucha particular -pero que es la de todos los que sufrieron abusos y, por qué no decirlo, positiva para el conjunto social- busca que la Cámara Baja apruebe la modificación del Código Penal para que los delitos de pederastia no prescriban.\nSíguenos en Whatsapp y recibe las noticias destacadas y las historias más interesantes.",

    "text": "Permit granted to allow Nibi the beaver to stay with wildlife rescue group\nBy Victoria D\nClick here for updates on this story\nCHELMSFORD, Massachusetts (WJZ) — Gov. Maura Healey has issued a special permit allowing a beaver to stay at a Massachusetts wildlife facility after MassWildlife said she had to be released into the wild.\nThe beaver, named Nibi, has captured the hearts of many people in Massachusetts and around the country. She was found orphaned in Sturbridge two years by Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, who have cared for her since.\nMassWildlife initially said Nibi had to return to the wild and Newhouse disagreed, saying Nibi would die and that she should remain with the rescue as an educational animal. A judge issued an order on Tuesday, preventing MassWildlife temporarily from taking the beaver.\n“Nibi has captured the hearts of many of our residents, mine included,” said Healey in a statement. “We’re excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse’s care, continuing to educate the public about this important species. I’m grateful to our state’s dedicated wildlife biologists who work every day to care for Massachusetts wildlife, and I hope Nibi inspires more people to protect our natural world.”\nA Change.org petition calling for Nibi to remain with Newhouse got more than 30,000 signatures.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "Western governments on Thursday warned of a “backwards step” in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, after a report found Tehran has increased its production of enriched uranium.\nA report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released this week said that Iran has “increased its production of highly enriched uranium, reversing a previous output reduction from mid-2023“.\nThe US , UK , France and Germany warned that the findings “will result in Iran tripling its monthly production rate of uranium enriched up to 60 per cent\".\n“We condemn this action, which adds to the unabated escalation of Iran’s nuclear programme,\" the joint statement read.\n“These decisions demonstrate Iran’s lack of good will towards de-escalation and represent reckless behaviour in a tense regional context.\n\"We urge Iran to immediately reverse these steps and de-escalate its nuclear programme.\"\nRead More Iran nuclear diplomacy 'remains vital' to Middle East security, UN says Opinion: 2023 showed us the cost of Iran's interventionism in the Middle East Iran's atomic energy chief Mohammad Eslami played down the IAEA report on Wednesday, saying it showed “nothing new”, Iranian media reported.\n“We did nothing new and are doing the same activities according to the rules,” Mr Eslami was quoted as saying.\nHighly enriched uranium is anything above 20 per cent, and weapons-grade uranium is commonly considered to have been enriched above 90 per cent, according to the Centre for Arms Control and Proliferation.\nLast week, the US said that it was prepared to use “all means necessary” to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear arms.\n“Iran should take actions to build international confidence and de-escalate tensions, not continue nuclear provocations that pose grave proliferation risks,” John Kelley, a US political counsellor, told the UN Security Council.\n\"We remain postured and prepared to use all means necessary to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\"\nTension between Iran and the US has escalated in recent months, as Washington continues to support Israel in its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians with no signs of slowing.\nTehran supports Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that launched a deadly attack on Israel that sparked the war and took 1,200 lives.\nIran also backs other regional militants, such as the Houthis in Yemen, who have escalated tension in the wider region as Israel's western-backed siege in Gaza endures.\nTehran suspended its compliance with limits on its nuclear activities set by a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, after former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions.\nIt has since built up its stocks of enriched uranium to 22 times the level permitted under the deal, AFP said, quoting a confidential IAEA report it saw last month.\nEfforts to revive the nuclear deal remain frozen after a breakdown in negotiations last year and subsequent political developments that have led to a further deterioration in relations between the parties.\nUpdated: December 28, 2023, 9:52 PM",

    "title": "I profeti della Bibbia erano antisemiti?",
    "text": "- supporto Réseau International Abbiamo bisogno di te da Michael Hudson Se i profeti dell’antico Israele come Isaia, Geremia, Ezechiele, Malachia e Amos fossero vivi oggi, Benjamin Netanyahu li accuserebbe di antisemitismo per aver osato descrivere il suo governo come un simulacro dell’alleanza mosaica. Uno dei temi ricorrenti che attraversa tutta la Bibbia ebraica – l’Antico Testamento del cristianesimo – è la critica ai re, alle corti ricche e corrotte che violavano i Dieci Comandamenti di Mosè che miravano a creare una società giusta ed equa proteggendo i poveri dalle l’oppressione economica della schiavitù per debiti e la perdita delle loro terre. Se i profeti fossero chiamati a esprimere un giudizio oggi, sarebbero il partito di destra Likud di Netanyahu e l'economia altamente diseguale di Israele che sarebbero condannati per aver violato le leggi più fondamentali del giudaismo biblico. Un profeta dopo l'altro descrisse tante volte che il Signore era estremamente dispiaciuto perché Israele si stava allontanando dai Suoi comandamenti al punto da ritirare la sua protezione e condannare come punizione la terra in cui Mosè aveva condotto i suoi discepoli ad essere conquistata. I profeti biblici attribuivano la sconfitta di Israele per mano di Sargon nel 722 aC alla punizione del Signore per aver infranto l'alleanza offerta dal Signore. La punizione di Israele corrispondeva al crimine: proprio come la sua ricca élite di creditori aveva espropriato i suoi fratelli della loro terra, le dieci tribù di Israele furono deportate in Mesopotamia e in Media, e le dimensioni della Giudea furono ridotte alla sola regione circostante Gerusalemme. Ezechiele, il grande profeta dell'esilio, fu portato a Babilonia nel 597 aC come ostaggio militare. Divenne la principale influenza di Esdra e della scuola sacerdotale che modificò le prime fonti della Torah in una versione che fu finalizzata quando gli ebrei tornarono da Babilonia e inscrisse i concetti babilonesi di giustizia economica nella Sacra Legge mosaica. In tono apocalittico, Ezechiele 7 annuncia: “Mi fu rivolta la parola del Signore: …La fine è ormai su di te e scatenerò su di te la mia ira. Ti giudicherò secondo la tua condotta e ti ripagherò per tutte le tue pratiche detestabili.”, citando la polarizzazione della ricchezza da parte degli ebrei più ricchi, la corruzione dei tribunali e la violazione dell'alleanza originaria con il Signore. I profeti odiavano se stessi? Coloro che criticano i politici di destra che ora stanno abolendo i tribunali del paese, incoraggiando lo sterminio di massa di civili e distruggendo le infrastrutture di un’intera società sono antisemiti? Dire che il 7 ottobre non è avvenuto “nel vuoto”, come ha fatto il segretario generale delle Nazioni Unite Antonio Guterres – anche dopo averlo definito un’atrocità – ti rende un antisemita? Ciò che trovo più incredibile è che nessuno studioso religioso indichi che la pretesa di Netanyahu di agire secondo un impegno biblico come scusa per commettere un genocidio conquistando la terra palestinese e distruggendo la sua popolazione esistente sia un simulacro di ciò che è effettivamente scritto nella Bibbia. Con un gioco di mano simile a quello di un mago che cerca di distrarre il pubblico da ciò che sta realmente accadendo, Netanyahu ha evocato quella che sostiene sia una scusa biblica per il genocidio israeliano. Ma quello che egli sostiene essere un patto della tradizione di Mosè è una richiesta feroce del giudice ed eminenza grigia Samuele che dice a Saul, il generale che voleva fare re: “Ora va' e colpisci Amalek [un nemico di Israele] e distruggi totalmente tutto ciò che appartiene a loro. Non risparmiarli, uccidi uomini e donne, bambini e neonati, bovini e pecore, cammelli e asini» (1 Samuele 15, 3). Queste parole non erano le parole del Signore, e Samuele non era Mosè. E non c’era alcuna promessa generale di sostenere gli ebrei indipendentemente da come si comportassero. E infatti, seguendo la richiesta di conquista di Samuele – come mezzo per rendere Saul abbastanza popolare da essere nominato re – Saul aveva infranto i comandamenti del Signore riguardanti le cerimonie religiose e le abitudini alimentari adeguate. Non c'è alcuna prova di ciò nella celebrazione da parte di Netanyahu dell'accordo di Samuel e Saul di diventare popolari attraverso la conquista militare. La cattiva condotta di Saul portò lo stesso Samuele a rimproverarlo, dicendogli che il Signore aveva deciso che si dovesse trovare un altro uomo come re d'Israele. Non fu il Signore a dare l'ordine di distruggere Amalek, ma un profeta desideroso di mettere un re sul trono. L’invocazione di un simile comando è la prova prima facie dell’intenzione di commettere un genocidio. Ma questo sembra meno importante per Netanyahu che soddisfare il desiderio di vendetta degli israeliani. Netanyahu non menziona il fatto che Saul disobbedì ai comandamenti del Signore e che il Signore lo rifiutò come re. Il Likud inoltre non riesce a riconoscere il contesto, alcuni capitoli prima, in 12 Samuele 15:XNUMX, che descrive la corruzione dei giudici e l'avvertimento di Samuele che: \"Se non obbedisci al Signore, se ti ribelli ai suoi comandi, la sua mano sarà contro di te\". L’avvertimento del Signore che “se persisti nel fare il male, tu e il tuo re sarete spazzati via» avrebbe dovuto avere una forte risonanza per Netanyahu. La Bibbia ebraica è nota per la sua critica ai re che governarono i regni di Giudea e Israele. Si tratta infatti di una lunga storia di rivoluzione sociale in cui i leader religiosi hanno cercato - spesso con successo - di sconfiggere il potere di un'oligarchia egoista e aggressiva, più volte denunciata per la sua avidità di impoverire i popoli, di impadronirsi delle loro terre e di ridurli in schiavitù dai debiti. . (Il mio libro \"…e loro condonano i loro debiti» “…e perdona loro i debiti” [Dresda 2018] descrive questa storia). Re ebrei, famiglie benestanti e corti corrotte portarono il Signore ad abbandonarli ripetutamente in Assiria, Babilonia e ad avversari minori quando si impegnavano in un comportamento egoista e oppressivo. Qual era il patto stipulato sull'Oreb, vicino al monte Sinai? Per dirla semplicemente, il Signore diede a Mosè i Dieci Comandamenti che avevano uno scopo morale di giustizia economica, e fece un patto che vincolava tutti i futuri ebrei a obbedire a questi comandamenti (Esodo 19-23 e Deuteronomio 5:2 e 28:43). Fin dall'inizio, il Signore minacciò di punire gli ebrei se avessero infranto questa alleanza. Le parole dei profeti citano i molti modi in cui le generazioni successive lo hanno spezzato. Il riferimento a questo contesto di parità era il ruolo dei profeti (sia antichi che moderni): risvegliare il popolo – ed essere disprezzato da chi detiene il potere, in particolare dalle oligarchie oppressive. La Giudea, secondo i comandamenti, avrebbe dovuto fornire aiuto reciproco, proteggere i poveri e impedire ai creditori di appropriarsi della terra. La Giudea perse quindi le battaglie contro gli stranieri, che i profeti descrissero come strumenti del Signore, usati per punire gli ebrei per aver trasgredito le leggi economiche e morali che il Signore aveva stabilito. Può esserci qualche dubbio che il grande Israele di oggi [il territorio su cui esercita il controllo totale, comprese Gaza, Cisgiordania e Gerusalemme Est] sia economicamente polarizzato e disuguale, sia finanziariamente che in termini di diritti umani? Deuteronomio 28:21-25 avverte gli ebrei che se non obbediscono ai comandamenti del Signore, “il Signore ti colpirà di malattie finché non ti avrà distrutto dal paese di cui entri in possesso\", e \"sarai sconfitto davanti ai tuoi nemici\". Il Deuteronomio (29, 24-25) ricorda poi agli ebrei che se il Signore fa a loro quello che ha fatto a Sodoma e Gomorra, Admat e Zeboim, “è perché questo popolo ha abbandonato l'alleanza del Signore, Dio dei suoi padri, l'alleanza che aveva concluso con loro quando li fece uscire dall'Egitto'. I profeti descrissero cosa significasse l’obbedienza al patto. Isaia 5:3 e 8 citano la disuguaglianza economica come il più grande guaio, incolpando gli anziani e i governanti per aver preso “il frutto della rapina dei poveri nelle vostre case\". Egli esclamò: \"Guai a voi che aggiungete una casa all'altra, che unite un campo all'altro, finché non ci sia più spazio libero sulla terra.\". Questo è esattamente il destino riservato ai palestinesi cacciati dalle loro terre dall'odierno Israele che agisce come stato colonizzatore. Isaia 10:1-3 esclama: “Guai a coloro che fanno leggi ingiuste, a coloro che emanano decreti oppressivi intesi a privare i poveri dei loro diritti e a derubare la giustizia del mio popolo oppresso depredando le vedove e derubando gli orfani. Cosa farai nel giorno del giudizio, quando la sventura verrà da lontano?» E in 29-13: «Il Signore ha detto: “Queste persone vengono a me con la bocca e mi onorano con le labbra, ma il loro cuore è lontano da me. Il culto che mi rendono è fatto solo di regole insegnate dagli uomini. … Guai a coloro che fanno di tutto per nascondere i propri piani al Signore”.'. Questo ti ricorda qualcosa? Isaia 48:1 e 8 dice: “Ascolta, o casa di Giacobbe, tu che porti il nome di Israele... e che invochi il Dio d'Israele, ma senza verità o giustizia. …So quanto sei perfido; sei stato chiamato ribelle fin dalla nascita'. Il profeta successivo, Geremia 2, accusa Israele di abbandonare il Signore e di infrangere così il patto, attirando su di loro il disastro con la loro “malvagità e il suo errore» e diventando “una vite selvatica e corrotta\". Chiamando Israele infedele (3:8 e 20-21), il Signore”diede all'infedele Israele il suo certificato di divorzio e la mandò via”, e la Giudea era altrettanto brutta. Il Signore minaccia ancora (17-3): «Per colpa tua perderai l'eredità che ti ho dato... perché hai acceso la mia ira ed essa brucerà per sempre'. In uno sviluppo che non ha né scioccato né sgomento i conservatori cristiani, gli Stati Uniti sono diventati i protettori e i signori del moderno Israele, mentre l’economia israeliana (come quella degli Stati Uniti) si polarizza sulle stesse linee denunciate dai profeti biblici, come quando Ezechiele (7 e 16) ripete l’ira del Signore contro l’infedele Gerusalemme, dicendo metaforicamente (16) che “ti sei fidata della tua bellezza e hai usato la tua fama per prostituirti”, senza tener conto dei poveri e dei bisognosi. E in 34:2: “Guai ai pastori d'Israele che si prendono cura solo di se stessi» mentre saccheggiavano il loro gregge. Amos 2 accusa Israele di molti peccati: “Vendono i giusti per denaro... e calpestano la testa dei poveri... e negano giustizia agli oppressi\". E Michea 7:3 dice: “Guai a coloro che organizzano l'ingiustizia, a coloro che tramano il male nei loro letti... perché è in loro potere farlo. …Per questo il Signore ha detto: “Io preparo contro questo popolo una sciagura dalla quale non potrete scappare”\", quando i ricchi si uniscono in modo che\"il sovrano esige doni, il giudice accetta tangenti, i potenti dettano ciò che vogliono – tutti cospirano insieme'. Il sionismo oggi è in contraddizione con la Bibbia ebraica. Ciò è comprensibile dato che la sua ideologia proviene da un gruppo molto laico nonostante la sua recente presa di potere da parte di ebrei autodefiniti ortodossi. La retorica usata da Netanyahu è una parodia, soprattutto se consideriamo quanto la Bibbia ebraica proclami che la ricchezza e la proprietà dovrebbero essere distribuite equamente e non concentrate nelle mani di un’oligarchia. I versetti 1 e 9 di Esodo 23 forniscono informazioni su come dovevano essere trattati gli stranieri – i palestinesi dell’epoca: “Non seguire la folla nel fare il maleMa \"stabilisci la legge della giustizia e della misericordia: non opprimere lo straniero; voi stessi sapete cosa vuol dire essere straniero perché siete stati stranieri in Egitto'. È giustizia e misericordia tagliare acqua, cibo, medicine e carburante a un’intera popolazione e radere al suolo o danneggiare metà dei suoi edifici e la maggior parte delle sue infrastrutture essenziali, compresi interi quartieri di case? È giustizia e misericordia costringere gli ospedali a chiudere, bombardare le ambulanze e sganciare sei bombe da una tonnellata su un campo profughi? Mentre miliardi di persone in tutto il mondo guardano i massacri della Notte dei Cristalli a Gaza e i palesi pogrom in Cisgiordania, i giornalisti occidentali “seri” avvertono della minaccia esistenziale rappresentata dai rifugiati che volano in deltaplano ma non hanno né aerei, né carri armati, né pezzi di artiglieria. . Questi stessi giornalisti ignorano la verità, ormai consolidata, che “il sangue dei martiri è il seme della fede” e che uccidere migliaia di innocenti immediatamente e molte migliaia nel caos che segue non indebolirà un movimento di resistenza ma lo rafforzerà. È questa stessa reazione, sulla scia del nazismo, che ha trasformato i leader sionisti di oggi in uomini pieni di odio. Nelle righe conclusive della Bibbia ebraica, Malachia 4 parla dell'insistenza del Signore sul fatto che il patto di Israele con Dio includeva un forte quid pro quo contrattuale come condizione del suo sostegno: “Tutti i superbi e tutti gli empi saranno pula e il giorno che verrà li brucerà, dice il Signore Onnipotente. «Ricordati della legge del mio servo Mosè, dei decreti e degli statuti che gli diedi sull'Oreb per tutto Israele». Se continuiamo a disobbedire nuovamente a queste leggi, il Signore ha minacciato: “Verrò e colpirò la terra con una maledizione”'. Sembra che la maledizione sia ora arrivata, sotto forma di una maggioranza della popolazione mondiale così sconvolta dal genocidio ipocrita commesso da due governi secolari che rivendicano (a discredito delle religioni occidentali) la santificazione divina, Israele e Stati Uniti, a un’epoca in cui l’economia occidentale non sovietica, creata nel 1945 sulla scia della seconda guerra mondiale, si sta dividendo in due parti. Viviamo in un’epoca secolare. Gli Stati Uniti sono diventati i protettori e i signori del moderno Israele, e si sono corrotti seguendo le stesse tendenze denunciate dai grandi profeti. Gli evangelisti americani, come il governo israeliano, hanno escluso il messaggio dei profeti biblici e il messaggio sociale di Gesù, ritenendo solo l'Alleanza come atto di conquista e come promessa di un biglietto per il paradiso senza alcuna contropartita comportamentale. L’ampio spettro della religione giudaico-cristiana è stato secolarizzato perché il mondo odierno differisce in maniera così fondamentale da quello dell’antichità classica. Gli evangelisti televisivi americani travisano il tentativo di Gesù di ripristinare l'anno giubilare mosaico inteso a cancellare i debiti che minacciavano di schiavitù le popolazioni antiche e le privavano dei mezzi di sussistenza sulla terra. Il “vangelo della prosperità” ha sostituito Gesù con Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman e Frederick Hayek. Già nel IV e V secolo, quasi non appena Costantino fece del cristianesimo la religione di stato romana, Agostino cambiò la traduzione della Preghiera di Gesù al Signore e del Discorso della Montagna da cancellazione del debito a idea non economica del peccato originale ereditato da Adamo. Per finire, la nuova interpretazione ha sostituito l'appello di Gesù alla cancellazione dei debiti con la richiesta di contributi in denaro da parte della Chiesa per ottenere indulgenze e perdono. Alla fine, il cristianesimo divenne così pro-creditore da difendere la sacralità del debito, non la sua cancellazione. Per finanziare le crociate del XIII secolo, i papi scomunicarono il clero cristiano e i riformatori secolari che si opponevano al pagamento dell'usura, ridefinita come \"interesse\" e consentita purché fossero i banchieri cristiani a concedere i prestiti. Israele potrebbe avere il diritto legale contorto di sparare ai palestinesi che attraversano il suo muro nel tentativo di difendere la terra che i coloni hanno loro illegalmente confiscato. Ma in quanto potenza occupante, non ha il diritto morale di ignorare praticamente tutte le leggi internazionali riguardanti la guerra e le punizioni collettive semplicemente per vendicarsi e mostrare al Libano, alla Siria, alla Turchia e all’Iran cosa farà loro con il sostegno degli Stati Uniti se unirsi alla mischia. Le azioni e le richieste di santificazione religiosa di Netanyahu sono l'antitesi del giudaismo originale. Il suo governo guidato dal Likud rifiuta l’etica della Bibbia ebraica tanto quanto gli evangelisti cristiani americani rifiutano il messaggio di Gesù. fonte: [Michael Hudson](https://michael-hudson.com/2023/11/were-the-biblical-prophets-anti-semitic/) inviata da A.

    "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — A man has been found guilty of killing a woman and injuring another while driving under the influence of marijuana near Town Center in Virginia Beach. A jury found Nathan Poole, a 26-year-old from Chesapeake, guilty of involuntary manslaughter, maiming and driving under the influence on Thursday. [On Aug. 22, 2022,](https://www.wtkr.com/news/one-dead-one-injured-one-arrested-in-drunk-driving-crash) Poole got behind the wheel after using marijuana, prosecutors said. While Poole was driving in the Town Center area, he hit two women: Rosa Blanco and her cousin Concepcion Blanco. WATCH: Man, 60, dies after being hit by vehicle in Portsmouth The cousins were leaving a restaurant after celebrating Rosa’s birthday, prosecutors added. They said the women were crossing the street when Poole hit them. Rosa died at the scene, and while Concepcion survived, she was hospitalized for five weeks and has severe, permanent injuries, prosecutors said. Video surveillance shows Poole’s vehicle rolling over the women without braking, prosecutors noted. [ 11:33 AM, Aug 23, 2022 ](https://www.wtkr.com/news/one-dead-one-injured-one-arrested-in-drunk-driving-crash) News One dead, one injured, one arrested in DUI crash Police say they conducted field sobriety tests — which indicated that Poole was impaired — and noted that he smelled like burnt marijuana. He admitted using marijuana the morning of the crash, and a toxicology report showed that the level of THC in Poole’s blood indicated “recent use,” police say. Virginia Beach Commonwealth’s Attorney Colin Stolle says the case is proof that it’s unsafe to drive after using marijuana. “While there is no forensic standard for THC impairment, the jury clearly rejected the defense’s assertion that Poole was not impaired and sent the message that he should be held accountable for his actions that day,” said Stolle. Poole was previously convicted for providing false information on a firearm consent form. He is scheduled to be sentenced on August 15.",
