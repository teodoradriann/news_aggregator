    "text": "A computer designed this house to be hurricane-proof: ‘The concept of inside-outside is constantly being questioned’\nA home in Punta Cana designed with the help of digital technology has a clear message for the successors of hurricanes Tammy, Philippe, and Lee: Bring it on.\nThe Dominican Republic household was made to withstand hurricanes and tropical storms like the ones with those monikers, according to a story on the project by Designboom.\nThe Mareines Arquitetura design studio borrowed digital tech from North America and Europe to create parts of the home, engineering a building meant to withstand 186-mile-per-hour winds, according to the studio.\nSevere weather is a growing concern around the world as planet overheating increases the odds of extreme events like tornados.\nIn the Dominican, hurricanes are already a seasonal concern. Evolving building designs, some inspired by Legos, are part of the way we can change our perspective about dealing with the impact of planet overheating and the weather.\nAnd, the designers of Punta Cana House make it clear that amenities and high style don’t need to be sacrificed in the process.\nIt’s “a house where the concept of inside-outside is constantly being questioned,” the designers wrote on the studio’s website.\nThe home, designed for an American family, includes a gym, bar, and barbecue, along with all the other standard rooms we are familiar with in the States. The more than 18,500-square-foot home was finished in 2017.\nThe design is where things become a bit foreign. From an aerial perspective, the home looks like a painting shape made by Picasso, as the mind tries to create images of familiar objects from the curvy, half-moon shapes that are part of the architecture.\nIt’s also reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous Fallingwater in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Wright’s ingenious cantilever design concept is fixed into the mountainside with a waterfall practically running through the home.\nIn the Dominican, the designers had to plan for a hurricane to safely pass over, and even through, the architecture.\nGlued, laminated wood makes the roof, veranda, and suites — all with a smooth, curved design. An open-air concept spills onto the beach. Steel pillars support much of the structure.\nThe home’s roof is made from copper from Spain. Water-tight design and thermal insulation help to secure the dwelling’s structure, with materials from France, the United States, and elsewhere. The ground was even raised to prevent storm swells from driving the ocean into the living spaces, per Designboom.\n“Local labor made all the difference in the finishing of the project. Besides the perfection in the location, construction of the foundations and concrete walls that received the steel and wood structures, the artistic quality of the stone, wood, and copper finishes that dominate the aesthetic composition of the house were not neglected,” project manager Matthieu Van Beneden told Designboom.\nAnd, while most people don’t have design studios creating Punta Cana Houses for them on every beach, concepts learned from the build can likely be applied to structures in Virginia, Florida, and the Gulf Coast, where severe storms are becoming more common.\n“Our projects are always faced as a challenge, running away from pre-established recipes and the repetition of our own solutions,” the designers said on the studio’s website.\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet .\nA computer designed this house to be hurricane-proof: ‘The concept of inside-outside is constantly being questioned’ first appeared on The Cool Down.",

    "text": "The defence minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader also said that Assembly elections would be held in Kashmir soon, but did not specify when. Defence minister Rajnath Singh , in an interview to PTI on Sunday, claimed that India would not need to capture Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by force as residents there would willingly want the territory to be merged with India on account of development works in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Union minister and veteran Bharatiya Janata Party said: “The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India. Such demands are now coming.” The Union minister also said: “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was, is, and will remain ours [India’s].” Singh added that there would soon come a time when the implementation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is no longer required in the Union territory. However, he clarified that this matter was the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act empowers security personnel to conduct operations and arrest individuals without a prior warrant and also provides immunity to members of the armed forces for shooting people dead. On Sunday, Singh also said that Assembly elections in Kashmir would be held soon, but did not specify when. In August 2019, the BJP-led Union government had abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories. In December, the Supreme Court in its verdict on petitions challenging the Centre’s decision had directed the government to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood “at the earliest and as soon as possible”. The court had also set September 2024 as the deadline for the Election Commission to conduct elections for the Legislative Assembly that is to be restored in Jammu and Kashmir.

    "text": "Is 90 Degrees Too Hot for Hermit Crabs? A Comprehensive Guide Yes, 90 degrees Fahrenheit is generally too hot for hermit crabs . While these creatures hail from tropical environments, prolonged exposure to temperatures that high can lead to heat stress , dehydration, and even death. Maintaining a stable and appropriate temperature range is crucial for their well-being.\nUnderstanding Hermit Crab Temperature Requirements Hermit crabs thrive in a specific temperature range that mimics their natural habitat. Understanding these requirements is the first step in providing proper care.\nIdeal Temperature: The optimal temperature range for most common hermit crab species is 72-84 degrees Fahrenheit (22-29 degrees Celsius) . Purple Pincher (PPs): As indicated, Purple Pincher hermit crabs (Coenobita clypeatus) can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures, with a minimum of around 75 degrees Fahrenheit . Temperature Gradient: It’s beneficial to create a temperature gradient within the crabitat, allowing the crabs to move to warmer or cooler areas as needed. This can be achieved using an under-tank heater (UTH) placed on one side of the tank. The Dangers of Overheating When the temperature exceeds the recommended range, hermit crabs can suffer serious consequences. Recognizing the signs of overheating is vital.\nHeat Stress: High temperatures cause stress, making crabs more susceptible to illness and impacting their molting process. Dehydration: Hermit crabs rely on humidity to keep their gills moist. Excessive heat can lead to rapid dehydration, compromising their ability to breathe. Signs of Overheating: Watch out for these warning signs: Lethargy: Reduced activity and a general lack of energy. Hanging out of the shell: A desperate attempt to cool down. Foaming at the mouth: Indicates severe distress and potential gill damage. Leaking brown liquid: A sign of severe overheating and internal damage. Maintaining the Right Temperature Several factors contribute to keeping your hermit crab tank at the correct temperature.\nUnder-Tank Heater (UTH): A UTH is the most common and effective way to heat a crabitat. Choose a size appropriate for your tank and place it on one side to create a temperature gradient. Thermostat: Use a thermostat to regulate the UTH and prevent overheating. This is particularly important in areas with fluctuating ambient temperatures. The thermostat probe should be placed inside the tank, near the center, to monitor the temperature accurately. Thermometer: Use a reliable thermometer to monitor the temperature inside the tank. Place the thermometer in the middle of the tank, away from the heat source, to get an accurate reading. Ventilation: Proper ventilation is essential to prevent the buildup of excessive heat and humidity. A mesh lid is ideal for allowing airflow while maintaining security. Ambient Temperature: Be mindful of the room temperature. A crabitat in a hot room will require more cooling measures than one in a cooler environment. Cooling Down an Overheated Tank If you notice that your hermit crab tank is too hot, take immediate action.\nTurn Off the UTH: Immediately turn off the under-tank heater or decrease the thermostat setting. Increase Ventilation: Increase airflow by opening the lid slightly or using a small fan to circulate air across the tank. Be cautious not to dry out the substrate too quickly, as this can lower the humidity. Misting: Gently mist the tank with dechlorinated water to increase humidity and provide a cooling effect. Ice Packs: Place ice packs (wrapped in towels to prevent direct contact) on top of the tank to help lower the temperature. Move the Tank: If possible, move the tank to a cooler location away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Humidity: The Other Half of the Equation Temperature and humidity are interconnected. High humidity helps crabs regulate their body temperature and prevents dehydration.\nIdeal Humidity: Aim for a humidity level between 75% and 85% . Hygrometer: Use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level in the tank. Maintaining Humidity: Several methods can help maintain adequate humidity: Misting: Regularly mist the tank with dechlorinated water. Water Bowls: Provide shallow dishes of dechlorinated fresh and saltwater for the crabs to soak in. Substrate: Use a substrate mix that retains moisture, such as coconut fiber (Eco Earth) and play sand. Lid: A tight-fitting lid helps retain humidity, but ensure adequate ventilation to prevent mold growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some frequently asked questions related to hermit crab temperature and care.\n1. What happens if the hermit crab tank is too cold? A tank that is too cold can be just as harmful as one that’s too hot. Cold temperatures can lead to lethargy, decreased appetite, and a weakened immune system, making crabs more susceptible to illness. Use an under-tank heater to maintain the appropriate temperature.\n2. Can I use a heat lamp instead of an under-tank heater? While heat lamps can provide warmth, they can also dry out the tank quickly and are less effective at creating a temperature gradient . An under-tank heater is generally recommended as the primary heating source. If using a heat lamp, monitor humidity levels closely.\n3. How do I know if my hermit crab is molting? Signs of molting include lethargy, hiding for extended periods, loss of appetite, a dull appearance, and digging into the substrate. Do not disturb a molting crab. It is a vulnerable time, and they need to be left alone.\n4. What substrate is best for hermit crabs? A mixture of play sand and coconut fiber (Eco Earth) is a popular and effective substrate. The sand provides a stable surface for digging, while the coconut fiber helps retain moisture, maintaining humidity.\n5. How deep should the substrate be? The substrate should be at least 6 inches deep , or three times the height of your largest crab, whichever is greater. This allows the crabs to bury themselves for molting.\n6. What do hermit crabs eat? Hermit crabs are omnivores and require a varied diet. Offer a mix of commercial hermit crab food, fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and proteins like dried shrimp or mealworms. Always provide a source of calcium , such as cuttlebone.\n7. How often should I clean the hermit crab tank? Spot clean the tank daily, removing any uneaten food or waste. A full substrate change is typically needed every 6-12 months , depending on the size of the tank and the number of crabs.\n8. What type of water should I provide for my hermit crabs? Provide two shallow dishes of water: one with dechlorinated fresh water and one with dechlorinated saltwater (using a marine aquarium salt mix). The saltwater is essential for maintaining shell water and overall health.\n9. Do hermit crabs need toys and enrichment? Yes! Hermit crabs are active and curious creatures. Provide them with plenty of climbing opportunities , such as driftwood, rocks, and vines. Offer extra shells in various sizes and shapes, and rotate toys regularly to keep them entertained.\n10. How long do hermit crabs live? With proper care, hermit crabs can live for 10-20 years or even longer in captivity.\n11. Is it normal for hermit crabs to fight? Shell fighting is common as crabs compete for the best-fitting shells. Provide a variety of shells in different sizes and shapes to minimize fighting. The shells must be bigger than the one they are currently wearing.\n12. Can hermit crabs drown? Yes, hermit crabs can drown if they cannot easily access air. Ensure that water dishes are shallow and that the substrate is deep enough for them to burrow if they need to escape the water.\n13. What size tank do I need for hermit crabs? A minimum of a 10-gallon tank is recommended for two small hermit crabs. For larger crabs or more crabs, a larger tank is necessary. A 20-gallon long or larger is ideal. The general rule is 5 gallons per crab.\n14. Why is my hermit crab not moving? There are several reasons why a hermit crab might not be moving: it could be molting , stressed, sick, or adjusting to a new environment. Observe the crab closely and ensure that the temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions are optimal.\n15. Are hermit crabs good pets for children? Hermit crabs can be enjoyable pets, but they require specific care and are not ideal for very young children. Older children who are responsible and willing to learn about their needs can make great hermit crab owners. It’s important to teach children how to handle them gently and understand their specific requirements.

    "text": "Moderne KI-Systeme könnten laut Verfassungsschutz künftig in der Lage sein, große Datenmengen automatisiert auszuwerten und so individuelle psychologische und soziale Merkmale von Nutzerinnen und Nutzern analysieren. In einem solchen Szenario könnten extremistische Organisationen diese Technologien nutzen, um maßgeschneiderte Inhalte zu entwickeln, die gezielt auf persönliche Überzeugungen, Interessen und Schwachstellen zugeschnitten sind. So könnte die KI etwa gezielt Personen ausfindig machen, die für radikale Inhalte empfänglich sind und personalisierte extremistische Inhalte generieren. KI-gesteuerte Chatbots und täuschend echte, gefälschte Videos könnten dazu genutzt werden, den Einfluss extremistischer Narrative erheblich zu verstärken.\nFür Sicherheitsbehörden große Herausforderung\nHerkömmliche Überwachungs- und Gegenmaßnahmen würden hier an ihre Grenzen stoßen, da sich KI-generierte Inhalte dynamisch verändern und klassische Erkennungsmechanismen umgehen können. Besonders problematisch wäre laut Verfassungsschutz, wenn extremistische Akteure generative KI gezielt einsetzen, um beispielsweise Verzerrungen oder Lücken in Sprach-, Bild- oder Desinformationserkennung zu finden und diese ausnutzen. Dadurch würden personalisierte Radikalisierungswege entstehen, die schwerer zu durchbrechen sind als herkömmliche Propaganda.\nDie DSN arbeitet daher intensiv mit nationalen und internationalen Partnern zusammen, um für die zukünftigen Herausforderungen gewappnet zu sein, wurde betont. Man setze dabei selbst auf KI-gestützte Erkennungssysteme, die in der Lage sein sollen, KI-generierte und personalisierte Propaganda zu identifizieren. Auch die Zusammenarbeit mit Technologieunternehmen werde entscheidend sein, um Manipulationsversuche frühzeitig zu erkennen. Darüber hinaus gelte es, die Öffentlichkeit zu sensibilisieren. \"Nur mit enger Zusammenarbeit von Staat, Sicherheitsbehörden und Technologieunternehmen sowie durch Stärkung von Medienkompetenz und dem kritischen Umgang mit Online-Inhalten können wir dem voranschreitenden Extremismus im Netz entgegentreten\", betonte Leichtfried.",

    "title": "¿Es el momento de “salir” a bolsa? ¿Cómo?: el caso de Cox",
    "text": "El Ibex 35 ronda entre los 11.400-11.800 puntos, cuando no hace mucho cotizó por debajo de los 8.000. El dinero fluye al mercado bursátil y no solo en España. Hay avidez por parte de los inversores, institucionales y particulares, para “colocar” la liquidez que circula en el mundo en proyectos rentables y a largo plazo.\nAdemás, despejada la incógnita de las elecciones americanas es esperable un repunte de las cotizaciones, aunque hayan bajado el miércoles. La estabilidad siempre es buena para el dinero. De manera que parece que es un buen momento para “salir” a bolsa.\nPor otra parte, el mercado bursátil es adecuado a proyectos empresariales que piensen en el medio y largo plazo. La financiación bancaria y los fondos están demasiado expuestos a los vaivenes de los ciclos cortos de la economía como para fiar inversiones a largo plazo a esas fuentes de financiación.\nEn poco tiempo hemos pasado de tipos de interés reales negativos y abundancia de oferta de dinero a subidas de los tipos básicos de los bancos centrales, alguno, como la Reserva Federal , por encima del 5%. Por contra, ahora vuelven las expectativas de reducción del coste del dinero. Parece que la inflación está controlada , pero la experiencia cercana es que cualquier “cisne negro” puede reavivarla.\nEn consecuencia, las empresas que juegan a proyectos como las infraestructuras deben equilibrar su financiación. Poco “apalancamiento financiero”, que tanto defienden los profesores expertos en esa materia en las escuelas de negocios, y más fondos propios y capital.\nEn poco tiempo hemos pasado de tipos de interés reales negativos y abundancia de oferta de dinero a subidas de los tipos básicos de los bancos centrales\nPor eso, el caso de Cox, me parece ejemplo paradigmático para “salir a bolsa” ahora; algo escaso en los últimos tiempos.\nCox está dedicada a proyectos que combinan el “agua” (desoladoras a nivel internacional) con la “energía”; tanto en régimen de construcción, como de explotación y distribución; propio o en concesión. Es decir infraestructuras necesarias para el futuro del mundo con fuertes inversiones y rentabilidad a largo plazo.\nEn consecuencia confluyen el buen momento del mercado bursátil, con las características adecuadas del tipo de empresa para acudir a él.\nEE\nCox saldrá a bolsa el 14 de noviembre con una valoración de entre 840 y 930 millones Ahora bien, aunque ambos factores encajen, una “salida a bolsa” exige ciertas condiciones. Tan importante es el “por qué”, como el “cómo”.\nPara que tenga éxito una “salida a bolsa” hay que conseguir la confianza de dos stakeholders fundamentales: los organismos reguladores (la CNMV en el caso de España) y los inversores.\n¿Que pide la CNMV? Hoy en día: garantías de “Buena Gobernanza”. Garantía que Cox ofrece tanto en sus documentos oficiales, como por la composición de su órgano de gobierno : el Consejo de Administración. La oferta de Cox en ese tema es que sólo habrá dos consejeros dominicales en él, Enrique Riquelme (fundador) y Alberto Zardoya, actuales accionistas, que ponen parte de su patrimonial al servicio del proyecto. El resto son independientes de acreditada carrera y experiencia.\n¿Que piden los inversores, los institucionales y los minoritarios dispersos? Seguridad y solvencia. Para ello, además de esa presencia de profesionales independientes de prestigio en el Consejo, se han buscado inversores institucionales con experiencia que acompañen con capital.\nCox tiene la promesa de suscripción de un tercio de la ampliación de capital por parte de capital árabe (marroquí y catarí) y europeo que esperaban la aprobación del folleto de emisión para confirmarlo. Aprobación que se produjo el 5 de este mes por la CNMV. Folleto en el que, con transparencia, se exponen la ventajas y riesgos de la operación.\nCox tiene la promesa de suscripción de un tercio de la ampliación de capital por parte de capital árabe (marroquí y catarí) y europeo que esperaban la aprobación del folleto de emisión para confirmarlo\nConclusión, parece que la operación ha sido planeada combinando varios factores: confluencia de dinero al mercado; adecuación de la estructura financiera de la empresa a los capitales bursátiles; estructura de los órganos de gobierno en la línea de lo recomendado; compañeros de capital con experiencia en el negocio, …\nTodo en dos sectores de futuro: la producción de agua potable, el oro liquido en un mundo cada vez más sediento, y las energías limpias. Sectores además de complementarios, sinérgicos. Las desoladoras, que Cox construye y gestiona en distintos territorios, consumen mucha energía. Combinar ambos sectores puede ser un acierto.\nSerá muy interesante seguir su futura evolución en el mercado continuo.\nNEWSLETTER - INVERTIA Cada mañana la apertura de mercados y las noticias que marcarán la agenda económica Apuntarme De conformidad con el RGPD y la LOPDGDD, EL LEÓN DE EL ESPAÑOL PUBLICACIONES, S.A. tratará los datos facilitados con la finalidad de remitirle noticias de actualidad.",

    "title": "Conservative think tank accuses Alabama programs and policies of religious discrimination",
    "text": "A new [report](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/unconstitutional-religious-discrimination-state-programs.pdf) from the Manhattan Institute details state-level programs that it suggests violate the freedom of religion guaranteed under the First Amendment and named a handful of programs in Alabama. The report, titled “Unconstitutional Religious Discrimination Runs Rampant in State Programs,” was authored by Manhattan Institute fellows Nicole Stelle Garnett and Tim Rosenberger and released earlier this month. According to the report’s executive summary, recent U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions “make clear that when the government adopts a program that extends public benefits to private organizations, the Free Exercise Clause prohibits it from excluding religious organizations from participating and from requiring them to secularize to participate.” Nevertheless, Garnett and Rosenberger insist that this rule has yet to be applied to many state policies nationwide. “Although the Court has made clear that the government cannot refuse to extend otherwise available public benefits to organizations because they are religious—or because they do religious things—many dozens, likely even hundreds, of public programs at all levels of government continue to do exactly that,” the authors explain. “This report collects and examines state-level programs that run afoul of the First Amendment’s nondiscrimination mandate.” Being among the [most religious states](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama) in the country, it might be surprising to find Alabama listed in the report. However, the authors mentioned seven different policies in Alabama, which they argued were violations of religious freedom. First among these was the state’s pre-K program guidelines, which state that “Pre-K day may not be religious in nature” and forbid religious activities within the school day. According to the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, qualified pre-K classrooms are funded through state grants. The report also cited Alabam’s Student Grant Program (ASGP), which can fund students at “sectarian” schools but only if the schools “perform essentially secular education functions.” According to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE), ASGP participant schools include religious schools like Amridge University (Churches of Christ), Faulkner University (Churches of Christ), Birmingham Southern College (Methodist), Huntington College (Methodist), Miles College (Methodist), Samford (Baptist), the University of Mobile (Baptist), Oakwood University (Seventh-Day Adventist), Spring Hill College (Catholic) and Stillman College (Presbyterian). Nevertheless, the report claims public funds from the ASGP can’t be used for religious purposes and that participating universities are required “to carefully segregate funds to ensure that this rule is enforced.” Moreover, the report accuses Alabama’s Private College and Universities Facilities Authorities Act of restricting revenue bonds from financing facilities primarily used for religious worship and instruction, such as in connection with a school or department of divinity. Outside of education, the report pointed to regulations on family resource centers that require them to provide only services that are “community-based, nonsectarian and nondiscriminatory.” It said Alabama bars municipal special health care facility authorities from supporting facilities used for religious purposes. It also called into question Alabama’s Administrative Code for excluding religious activities from health and human care services under state employee combined charitable campaign programs. Finally, the report cited an Alabama law that excludes religious organizations from receiving funds from greyhound racing days. “The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the Free Exercise Clause protects the right of faith-based organizations to cooperate with governments to advance the common good in public programs—that the government is precluded from excluding them from participating, or requiring them to secularize in order to participate,” the report’s authors wrote. “Despite the Supreme Court’s admonitions, many state and local government programs continue to put unconstitutional restrictions and prohibitions on faith-based organizations.” “The programs highlighted in this report are likely only the tip of an unconstitutional iceberg,” they concluded. “We hope that our effort to shed light on the persistence of programmatic restrictions that run afoul of the principle established last year in Carson v. Makin will encourage policymakers to correct these constitutional errors expeditiously. Policymakers can start by correcting the programs discussed here, but that will be only the beginning.” To connect with the author of this story or to comment, email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#25524c49490b4749444e40495c65141d141c4b4052560b464a48) or find him on Don’t miss out!
