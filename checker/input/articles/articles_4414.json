    "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya ( [Morning Star News](https://morningstarnews.org/)) – Before Sawuba Naigaga succumbed to injuries her 25-year-old son inflicted on her in Uganda this month, she described the assault to a friend from her hospital bed. The friend said Naigaga’s son, Ashirafu Basalirwa, returned home to Busia town, Busia District from four years of working in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 15 and found his mother mentioning the name of Jesus as she prayed. “As I was praying with my eyes closed, my son called me, saying ‘Mum, Mum – you are becoming a disgrace to the family and the religion of Allah,’” the 46-year-old Naigaga told her friend before she died on Dec. 17. “I kept quiet, and he pushed me hard to the wall, then I fell down. He then took a blunt object and hit me at the head. Since then, I lost all my consciousness, only to find myself in the hospital bed.” The friend said she had told Naigaga the gospel and led her to Christ. “I preached the Good News of Jesus to Sawuba, who gave her life to Christ in 2022,” said the friend, whose name is withheld for security reasons. “We had been attending church. One thing which I know is that she kept her faith silent from her family members, including her son.” Basalirwa had gone to Saudi Arabia to look for employment after graduating from an Islamic university in Uganda, the friend said. She found Naigaga the day of the assault. “I ran to Sawuba’s home after hearing wailing from her house and an alarm from neighbors,” the friend recalled. “I dashed quickly to the scene, and I found her in a pool of blood but in an unconscious state. We rushed her to a nearby hospital, but she breathed her last breath after two days on Dec. 17 due to internal bleeding.” Basalirwa has fled and is in hiding, sources said. Besides her son, Naigaga is survived by a daughter. The killing was the latest of [many](https://morningstarnews.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7ec6d7eb2533a90581f839110&id=95cd8d3618&e=d656281a7e) instances of persecution of Christians in Uganda that Morning Star News has documented.

    "text": "SINGAPORE: Deliveroo Singapore has announced its Deliveroo Rider Academy expansion, providing over 1,500 courses free of charge to self-employed riders and their families, in partnership with Lynx Educate.\nThis collaboration aims to cater to the rising demand for upskilling and continual learning in line with Singapore’s goal on the importance of upskilling and continuous learning to meet productivity growth targets.\nThe SkillsFuture Level-Up programme addresses the growing demand for upskilling. The partnership of Deliveroo and Lynx Educate brings together various learning providers and higher education institutions, providing Deliveroo riders with access to a diverse range of online courses to enhance their career prospects.\nRiders can choose from over 1,500 courses covering various fields such as business management, coding, data science, project management, and photography, among others, provided by reputable institutions like The Open University, OpenClassrooms, and Chegg Skills.\nThe Deliveroo Rider Academy also offers advanced vocational and academic courses, including the ‘Web Developer – Skills Bootcamp,’ upon successful application, aimed at providing riders and their families with higher qualifications.\nWhat sets this programme apart is its inclusivity, allowing riders to extend the benefit to their family members.\nSince its inception in 2019, the Rider Academy has garnered strong interest among Singaporean riders, with over 600 courses undertaken so far.\nDigital skills have emerged as a key area of interest, reflecting the country’s Smart Nation initiative. Notably, courses such as ‘Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis,’ ‘Build Your First Web Pages with HTML and CSS,’ and ‘Discover Digital Marketing’ have been popular choices among riders.\nMuhamad Rashid, a 31-year-old Deliveroo rider who also works as a Quick Response Officer in the security industry, is an advocate for upskilling. With over 700 hours spent on OpenClassrooms courses, he believed in the importance of lifelong learning in staying prepared for career shifts and opportunities.\nHe said, “I have a Diploma in Game Design, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to brush up on my technical skills with the free upskilling courses, much thanks to Deliveroo and OpenClassrooms.\n“Even though I work in a completely different sector now, it’s always good to have options and be open to possibilities in shifting industries. You won’t know what the future will hold, so it’s best to always be prepared by learning as much as you can.”\nThe initiative goes beyond offering short courses; riders can also apply for six-month intensive scholarship programmes provided by OpenClassrooms, equivalent to an associate degree level of education.\nMr Mohamed Nizamudeen is a 46-year-old Deliveroo rider who was the first to complete the OpenClassrooms scholarship last year. He highlighted the impact of such programmes on professional career growth and market competitiveness. He had a background in marketing and took up OpenClassrooms’s Diploma in Digital Marketing course.\nHe shared, “I was very heartened when I first heard that I was enrolled in Deliveroo Rider Academy’s scholarship programme. I always had plans on landing a job in marketing so I’m sure this Diploma will be helpful in my resume as I expand my skill set within the industry. I understand how competitive it is out there, so I’m very thankful to Deliveroo for their support in my professional career growth.”\nMr Jason Parke, General Manager of Deliveroo Singapore, expressed his joy in witnessing the positive reception of the Rider Academy among riders since its launch.\nHe said, “Our partnership with Lynx Educate is a strong testament to our commitment to the growth and development of our riders, and we look forward to seeing more of them pursue their aspirations with the expansion of our course offerings.”\nSylvie Milverton, CEO, and co-founder of Lynx Educate, echoes this sentiment, stating that Lynx is proud to partner with Deliveroo in managing its Rider Academy.\nShe said, “By leveraging our extensive network of educational partners on our platform, they will now have access to participate in meaningful learning programs and explore their career interests. We share Deliveroo’s commitment to offering education as a way to support and show appreciation for their valued riders.” / TISG\nRead also: “Nobody is forgotten” — Deliveroo Singapore spends Ramadan with Jamiyah Home for the Aged (Darul Takrim)",

    "text": "JUEVES, 19 de diciembre de 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Cuanto más enfermo se pone un adulto mayor, más probabilidades tiene de desarrollar problemas renales además de sus otros problemas de salud.\nUn nuevo estudio, publicado el 17 de diciembre en la revista Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (JAGS), muestra que a medida que aumenta el número de enfermedades crónicas de una persona, un declive en su función renal se vuelve más probable y pronunciado.\nEsto es particularmente cierto en el caso de las personas con muchos problemas cardíacos y las personas con una gran cantidad de enfermedades crónicas que requieren muchos medicamentos y tratamientos.\n\"Nuestros hallazgos enfatizan la importancia de una evaluación integral que considere no solo la carga general de enfermedades crónicas, sino también la compleja interacción entre las enfermedades al evaluar el riesgo de declive de la función renal en los adultos mayores\", señaló el investigador principal, Giorgi Beridze, estudiante doctoral de epidemiología geriátrica del Instituto Karolinska.\nEn el estudio, los investigadores siguieron la salud de casi 3,100 adultos mayores en Suecia durante un periodo de 15 años como parte de un estudio sobre el envejecimiento.\nLos investigadores buscaron específicamente patrones de enfermedades crónicas que podrían aumentar el riesgo de enfermedad renal de una persona.\nMás de un tercio (un 38 por ciento) de las personas a partir de 65 años experimentan un declive persistente en su función renal, lo que puede afectar de forma grave a su salud general y a su calidad de vida, señalaron los investigadores en las notas de respaldo.\nEl equipo identificó cinco patrones diferentes de enfermedades crónicas en las que las personas mayores podrían caer a medida que envejecen y el tiempo pasa factura.\nDos patrones de enfermedades crónicas no parecieron afectar a la salud renal: uno que involucraba problemas psiquiátricos y respiratorios, y otro que reflejaba a personas mayores relativamente sanas con pocos problemas médicos continuos.\nPero tres patrones de enfermedades crónicas parecieron aumentar específicamente el riesgo para la salud renal de una persona:\nUna alta tasa de problemas de salud cardíaca como presión arterial alta, colesterol elevado, enfermedad cardíaca y otros factores de riesgo cardíaco, que triplicaron con creces el riesgo de deterioro renal de una persona.\nUna alta carga general de problemas de salud crónicos, lo que aumenta el riesgo renal en aproximadamente un 45%. Más de un tercio de los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica al inicio del estudio pertenecían a esta categoría.\nUn patrón de enfermedades crónicas que afectan la función cerebral y los sentidos de una persona aumentó el riesgo renal relativo de una persona en aproximadamente un 55%.\nEstas enfermedades crónicas podrían dañar los riñones porque se asocian con la diabetes, o porque crean una inflamación que daña los órganos, apuntaron los investigadores.\nRastrear estos patrones de enfermedad a medida que las personas envejecen, y gestionar las enfermedades crónicas, podría ayudar a las personas a mantener su salud renal, concluyeron los investigadores.\n\"Los individuos que presentan enfermedades que son características de patrones de multimorbilidad de alto riesgo podrían beneficiarse particularmente de una mayor monitorización de la función renal, la promoción de un estilo de vida saludable y las intervenciones farmacológicas oportunas\", dijo Beridze.\nMás información\nLos Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE. UU. ofrecen más información sobre los factores de riesgo de la enfermedad renal.\nFUENTE: Wiley, comunicado de prensa, 18 de diciembre de 2024; Revista de la Sociedad Americana de Geriatría (JAGS), estudio, 17 de diciembre de 2024",

    "text": "After missing out on the Premier League title in the 2022/23 season,\nArsenal are title challengers once again this season. Since the start of the season, they have not dropped below the top 5 and were usually found in the top 3. In the last 6 game weeks, they were at the top of the league for 4 of them, but after losing to West Ham United at home they have now dropped to 2nd.\nIn a match that highlighted all of Arsenal’s problems, West Ham had just 6 shots on goal and scored 2. Meanwhile, Arsenal had 30 shots, with 8 on target. They also had a record-breaking 77 touches in the opposition’s box without a goal.\nThomas Soucek opened the scoring in the 13th minute, which happened due to a massive error by Ben White. Trying to clear the ball, White hit the ball into Oleksander Zinchencko. The ball deflected off the Ukrainian and looked like it had gone out of bounds.\nJarrod Bowen managed to cross it back in for Soucek, who scored. After a lengthy VAR check, the goal was awarded.\nFormer Gunner, Konstantinos Mavropanos, scored the winner in the 55th minute. It came off a corner taken by James Ward-Prowse. Arsenal had over 75% possession, but\nDavid Moyes’s low block created problems for Mikel Arteta’s team. They just were unable to get past the defenders to get a single goal. Declan Rice gave a penalty in the final moments of the match, but Said Benharama’s penalty was saved by David Raya. WATCH: Jose Mourinho HILARIOUSLY shrugs off Arsenal while PREDICTING Premier League 23/24 champions\nFans banter Arsenal as they ‘bottle’ the top-of-the-table yet again\nMany fans took the opportunity to make fun of Arsenal, who were no longer table toppers. Rival fans made fun of the Gunners’ inability to score, as they took over 30 shots without a single goal. Some said they were ready for Arsenal fans to cry, who were unhappy with the VAR call regarding the first goal. Some praised Martin Odegaard, who put up a great performance.\nCheck out some of the fans’ reactions:\nWith this loss at home,\nArsenal lose their spot at the top of the table. They now sit with 40 points, 2 behind Liverpool. With Manchester City having a game in hand, they could overtake the Gunners as long as they win the extra fixture. Arsenal now play Fulham at the Craven Cottage on New Year’s Eve.\nIn case you missed:\n“Trophyless again this season” – Fans MOCK Tottenham Hotspur as Brighton secure dominant 4-2 victory WATCH: Real Betis officially extends Isco’s contract with HILARIOUS Ali G video Syed Talib Haider",
