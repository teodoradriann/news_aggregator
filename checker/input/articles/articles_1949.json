Reports suggest he supplied sensitive information about Moldova and Ukraine to Russian intelligence services. Following these allegations, Gorgan has been suspended from his UN position in Chisinau. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 14-06-2024 02:40 IST | Created: 14-06-2024 02:40 IST Moldovan prosecutors said on Thursday they opened a criminal case against the former chief of general staff of Moldova's armed forces following a media report alleging he had spied for Russia. The Insider, a Russian investigative outlet, in cooperation with Moldovan publication Malenkaya Strana reported last week that former army official Igor Gorgan passed sensitive information about both Moldova and neighbouring Ukraine to Russia's intelligence services. He served as the army's chief of staff from 2013-2016 and from 2019-2021. In a statement, prosecutors said Gorgan was suspected of \"alleged subversive actions for transferring to a foreign state and its representatives some data concerning Moldova's national defense system\". Following the publication, Gorgan was suspended from his current position as head of security at the Chisinau office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the office's press secretary said. Gorgan has not commented on the media investigation or prosecutors' statement. He could not be reached for comment. There was no comment from Russia. Gorgan, dismissed by pro-European President Maia Sandu as chief of staff in 2021, is a graduate of a Soviet-era military school. Sandu said he would be stripped of his rank of general as well as of his state honours. Moldova's relations have deteriorated with the Kremlin during Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Its pro-Western government has staunchly condemned the invasion and accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow the Moldova government.

    "text": "Afamitresgene autoleucel (afami-cel), an engineered T-cell therapy, has yielded durable responses in heavily pretreated, metastatic or unresectable synovial sarcoma, according to research published in The Lancet.1\nOn the basis of these findings, from the SPEARHEAD-1 trial, the biologics license application for afami-cel was granted priority review by the US Food and Drug Administration.2 If the therapy is approved, it will be the first new treatment option for\nsynovial sarcoma in more than 10 years.\nAs part of this phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:\nNCT04044768), 52 patients with metastatic or unresectable synovial sarcoma (n=44) or myxoid round cell liposarcoma (n=8) were enrolled and treated.1 The patients had a median age of 41 years, had an eligible HLA-A*02 allele and MAGE-A4 expression, and had received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy.\nAfter lymphodepletion, 20 patients received bridging therapy. All patients received 1 dose of afami-cel. The median dose was 8.7 × 10⁹ transduced T cells, and the median transduction efficiency was 61.5%.\nThe overall response rate (ORR) was 37%, and all responses were partial. The ORR was 39% in patients with synovial sarcoma and 25% in patients with myxoid round cell liposarcoma.\nThe median time to response was 4.9 weeks. The median duration of response was 11.6 months in patients with synovial sarcoma and 4.2 months in patients with myxoid round cell liposarcoma.\nAt a median follow-up of 32.6 months, the median progression-free survival was 3.7 months in the entire cohort, 3.8 months in patients with synovial sarcoma, and 2.4 months in patients with myxoid round cell liposarcoma.\nThe median overall survival was 15.4 months in the overall cohort. It was 16.9 months in patients with synovial sarcoma, not reached in responders with synovial sarcoma, and 10.9 months in non-responders with synovial sarcoma.\nAll patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs were cytopenias, including lymphopenia (96%), neutropenia (85%), and leukopenia (81%).\nGrade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 69% of patients. One patient (2%) had grade 3 CRS, and there were no cases of grade 4 or 5 CRS. In fact, there were no treatment-related deaths.\n“These results suggest that a one-time treatment with afami-cel has the potential to extend life while allowing responders to go off chemotherapy,” study author Sandra P. D’Angelo, MD, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, New York, said in a statement.3 “The publication of this data further validates the potential of afami-cel to offer a new tool to address the unmet needs of people diagnosed with these often devastating diseases.”\nThe biologics license application for afami-cel has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 4, 2024.\nDisclosures: This research was supported by Adaptimmune.

    "text": "August 09, 2024 Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s feud with Donald Trump is the result of a larger American sentiment, says expert. In his piece for The Sun, royal expert Lee Cohen notes how Trump is voicing the US set of opinions over Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. He writes: “Consider, for example, his views on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whom for years he has been involved in an escalating tit-for-tat war of words with.” Speaking of Trump’s son Eric, the expert noted: “This week, his son, Eric, labelled Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as ‘spoiled apples’ - proving that, indeed, Donald’s own apple didn’t fall far from the tree.” “Observers might be tempted to view the Trump-Sussex discord as just another round of celebrity gossip,” he added. “But, it tellingly proves the former [and perhaps next] President is feeling emboldened enough to give voice to the frustrations of citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, who increasingly hold a widespread disdain for the Sussexes’ perceived disloyalty, victimhood and entitlement,” Lee continued: This comes as Eric Trump branded the Sussexes ‘spoiled apples.’ He noted: “Eric added further fuel to this feud in a recent GB News interview, characterising the Sussexes as ‘spoiled apples’ and suggesting he would “happily send them back” to the UK.” Said the expert: “Such remarks encapsulate a broader sentiment among many Americans who perceive Harry and Meghan as self-serving, hypocritical grifters.”",

    "title": "Conflicto en Oriente Próximo, en directo | Última hora de la guerra de Israel en Gaza",
    "text": "El Gobierno de Israel reanudó en la madrugada de este 18 de marzo la guerra en Gaza con el mayor ataque desde el inicio de la tregua hace dos meses y que supone la ruptura de facto del alto el fuego. Sigue aquí la última hora del conflicto en Oriente Próximo , en directo.\nActualizar 12 JUN 2025 - 8:09\nFracasa la solicitud para disolver el Parlamento israelí tras un pacto entre Likud y formaciones ultraortodoxas El Parlamento israelí ha rechazado este jueves en primera lectura la solicitud de la oposición para presentar una moción de censura contra el Gobierno de Israel , gracias a un acuerdo entre fuerzas ultraortodoxas y la formación del primer ministro del país, Benjamín Netanyahu , el Likud , sobre el reclutamiento de haredíes para engrosar las filas del Ejército. La iniciativa para disolver el Parlamento de Israel (Knesset) ha sido tumbado con 61 votos negativos frente a 53, después de que la mayoría de diputados ultraortodoxos decidieran no apoyarla.\n12 JUN 2025 - 7:47\nLa Fundación Humanitaria para Gaza denuncia la muerte de cinco trabajadores palestinos en un ataque de Hamás en la Franja La Fundación Humanitaria para Gaza (GHF, en inglés ) denunció la madrugada de este jueves la muerte de al menos cinco trabajadores palestinos tras un ataque de Hamás contra el bus en el que viajaban, además dijo que algunos miembros podrían haber sido secuestrados . \"Aún estamos recopilando información, pero lo que sabemos es devastador: hay al menos cinco muertos, múltiples heridos y el temor de que algunos miembros de nuestro equipo hayan sido tomados como rehenes. Condenamos este atroz y deliberado ataque \", dijo la fundación en un comunicado. La organización responsabiliza plenamente a Hamás del ataque y añadió que este grupo \"ha amenazado abiertamente\" al equipo en los últimos días.\n12 JUN 2025 - 7:20\nAl menos diez muertos y 120 heridos entre los gazatíes que esperaban ayuda en un centro de distribución Al menos diez personas han muerto y 120 han resultado heridas en la madrugada de este jueves tras un bombardeo israelí contra aglomeraciones de civiles cerca de un punto de distribución de ayuda humanitaria de la Fundación Humanitaria de Gaza (GHF, por sus siglas en inglés) en la zona central de la Franja. Múltiples drones israelíes habrían lanzado varias bombas contra la población civil que esperaba a recibir ayuda en la calle Salah al Din, próxima al puesto de control israelí en el eje de Netzarim, según ha señalado la agencia de noticias palestina Sand.\n11 JUN 2025 - 23:50\nFuerzas egipcias detienen a más de 100 activistas que iban a marchar por Gaza Fuerzas de seguridad egipcias han detenido a más de cien activistas que tenían previsto participar en la marcha por Gaza hacia el lado egipcio de Rafah, pese a que Egipto no ha autorizado la concentración, informó este miércoles a EFE una fuente de seguridad egipcia.\nSegún el informante, que pidió el anonimato por la sensibilidad de este tema, la mayoría de los detenidos son franceses , en total 52, mientras que unos 40 son argelinos, así como el resto son marroquíes y libios.\nHasta el momento, Egipto no ha reaccionado oficialmente ante esta información.\n11 JUN 2025 - 21:56\nIsrael recupera en Gaza los cuerpos de dos rehenes secuestrados el 7 de octubre de 2023 El Ejército israelí recuperó en la Franja de Gaza los cuerpos de dos rehenes israelíes secuestrados en el ataque de Hamás del 7 de octubre de 2023, uno de ellos identificado como Yair Yaakov , anunció este miércoles en un comunicado la oficina del primer ministro, Benjamín Netanyahu .\n\"En una operación del Ejército y el Shin Bet (el servicio interior de inteligencia de Israel) en la Franja de Gaza, los cuerpos de dos de nuestros secuestrados fueron devueltos a Israel: el difunto Yair Yaakov y otro secuestrado cuyo nombre aún no ha sido revelado \", recogió el comunicado.\n11 JUN 2025 - 20:06\nMilei en Israel: \"La comunidad internacional invierte la carga de víctima y victimario\" El presidente de Argentina, Javier Milei, afirmó este miércoles durante un discurso ante el Parlamento hebreo que en el caso del conflicto entre Israel y Hamás la comunidad internacional ha invertido \"la categoría de víctima y victimario\", ya que \"una nación que se defiende de la barbarie es considerada la agresora\".\n\"Argentina está con ustedes en este difícil momento; lamentablemente no puede decirse lo mismo de la comunidad internacional, que se ha dejado manipular por la propaganda terrorista, invirtiendo las categorías de víctima y victimario\", dijo Milei.\n11 JUN 2025 - 19:14\nAl menos un muerto y tres heridos en un ataque con un dron de Israel en el sur de Líbano Al menos una persona ha muerto y otras tres han resultado heridas en un ataque con un dron llevado a cabo este miércoles por el Ejército de Israel en el distrito de Bint Jbeil , en el sur de Líbano, a pesar del acuerdo de alto el fuego alcanzado en noviembre de 2024.\nEl Ministerio de Sanidad libanés ha anunciado que \"un ataque con un dron israelí en la localidad de Beit Lif, en el distrito de Bint Jbeil, ha resultado en un martirizado y otros tres heridos \", según un breve comunicado recogido por la agencia de noticias NNA.\nPor el momento, el Ejército de Israel no se ha pronunciado sobre este nuevo bombardeo, pero en otras ocasiones ha defendido sus ataques argumentando que actúa contra actividades del partido-milicia Hezbolá y que, por ello, no viola el alto el fuego, si bien tanto Beirut como el grupo se han mostrado críticos con estas acciones , igualmente condenadas por Naciones Unidas.\n11 JUN 2025 - 18:15\nEvacúan a Italia a un niño gazatí que perdió a sus 9 hermanos y su padre en un ataque israelí El niño gazatí Adam al Najjar , de 11 años, que quedó gravemente herido por un ataque israelí contra su casa a finales de mayo y que mató a sus nueve hermanos y a su padre , fue evacuado este miércoles de la Franja de Gaza, junto a su madre, la pediatra Alaa, para ser tratado en Italia.\n\"Esta mañana un grupo de pacientes que necesitaban atención médica fueron evacuados con éxito de Gaza. Entre ellos se encontraban Adam Najjar y su madre\", confirmó a EFE el Centro Legal Gisha para la Libertad de Movimiento, una ONG israelí, que estuvo en contacto con el tío del menor, Ali Najjar.\nSegún esta ONG, Adam sufrió daños neurológicos y múltiples heridas en todo el cuerpo, lo que requirió cirugías que incluyeron injertos de nervio radial y la restauración del tejido nervioso dañado.\n11 JUN 2025 - 17:45\nIsrael pone en aislamiento penitenciario a la eurodiputada francesa de la Flotilla Las autoridades israelíes pusieron este miércoles en aislamiento penitenciario a la eurodiputada francesa Rima Hassan y al activista brasileño Thiago Ávila , que fueron detenidos junto a los otros 10 activistas del barco Madleen de la Flotilla de la Libertad interceptado por el Ejército israelí el pasado lunes de madrugada.\nSegún informó el grupo legal palestino Adalah , que representa a los activistas en Israel, Hassan fue trasladada a la prisión de Neve Tirza y puesta allí en \"aislamiento en condiciones inhumanas\" tras escribir la frase \"Palestina Libre\" en la cárcel de Givón , donde estaba ingresada con los siete activistas restantes que no aceptaron ser deportados de Israel y están en espera de una deportación forzosa.\n\"La trasladaron a una celda pequeña, sin ventanas y con pésimas condiciones higiénicas , y se le negó el acceso al patio de la prisión\", dicen sobre Hassan.\n11 JUN 2025 - 17:06\nLa UE exige a Israel revertir su veto a las relaciones bancarias ante el riesgo de colapso de la Autoridad Palestina La Unión Europea ha exigido este jueves a Israel que dé marcha atrás a la decisión anunciada por el ministro de Finanzas de Israel, Bezalel Smotrich , de cancelar las exenciones que permiten a los bancos israelíes trabajar con aquellos que operan en los territorios palestinos, apuntando que la medida tiene un efecto \"devastador\" y pone en riesgo de colapso a la Autoridad Palestina.\nEn rueda de prensa desde Bruselas, el portavoz de Exteriores de la UE, Anouar El Anouni , ha expresado la \"profunda preocupación\" de la diplomacia europea por la orden de Smotrich respecto a la colaboración con entidades bancarias palestinas. \"Podría dejarlos fuera del sistema financiero israelí, devastar una economía palestina ya paralizada y puede llevar al colapso de la Autoridad Palestina\", ha avisado.\nIgualmente, ha alertado del efecto que tendrá esta medida en el apoyo financiero que presta la UE a la Autoridad Palestina y los ciudadanos de Cisjordania , en especial para el mantenimiento de servicios públicos básicos.",

    "text": "A firefly discovered in Delaware might soon be protected under the federal Endangered Species Act The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to list the Bethany Beach firefly as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. The Bethany Beach firefly is a nocturnal beetle found in coastal Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, and named for the Delaware coastal town where it was discovered in 1949. The firefly is less than half an inch long with a black marking on its head and a distinctive flash pattern. Julie Slacum is the species lead for the Bethany Beach firefly at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Chesapeake Bay field office. She explains how you can identify a Bethany Beach firefly. \"Most people aren't going to see them when they go to the beach unless they're hiking back behind the dunes, but what they'll see is essentially a lightning bug that has a green flash, the difference in what we would see in our backyards in this area where it's a yellow flash,\" said Slacum. It’s usually found in low-lying freshwater marsh areas near coastal dunes within 500 meters of the Atlantic shoreline - on both state and federal lands The biggest threats to the firefly include rising sea levels, development, light pollution, recreation, grazing by ponies, pesticides, and invasive plant species. Slacum explains how the protections would work. \"So essentially any project or action that would occur on those lands, the state or the federal agency would come to us to see if their project would have any impact on the species, and then we would try to work with them to minimize impacts and just make sure that their project wouldn't result in the extinction of the species as a whole,\" said Slacum. Slacum adds listing the species brings additional attention and partners to help it recover over time. This would be the first firefly to receive federal attention if listed.",

    "text": "Feb 22 Gay Rights Advocates in Kentucky Say Expansion to Religious Freedom Law Would Hurt LGBTQ+ Safeguards Bruce Schreiner READ TIME: 3 MIN. Gay rights advocates pushed back Wednesday against a Republican-sponsored measure to broaden Kentucky's religious freedom law, claiming it threatens to undermine community-level \"fairness ordinances\" meant to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. The measure, House Bill 47, won approval from the House Judiciary Committee, but some supporters signaled a willingness to make revisions to the bill as it advances to the full House. The proposal would need Senate approval if it passes the House. Republicans have supermajorities in both chambers. \"I don't think any of us here want to open a floodgate of lawsuits or, for that matter, to invalidate what local cities have done across Kentucky,\" said Republican state Rep. Daniel Elliott, the committee chairman. State Rep. Steve Rawlings, the bill's lead sponsor, said the intent is to give Kentuckians a \"fair day in court\" if their rights to exercise their religious beliefs are infringed by any government action. The state's existing religious freedom law, enacted more than a decade ago, consists of a few lines, he said. \"The brevity of our current statute and the lack of definitions can give courts ... the excuse to undermine the religious freedom of Kentuckians,\" Rawlings said. Opponents warned that the bill would risk triggering a wave of lawsuits against Kentucky cities and counties that enacted fairness ordinances over the past 25 years. Those ordinances prohibit discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \"There are 24 communities all across our commonwealth that have stood up to protect LGTBQ people and you're putting every one of them at risk if you pass House Bill 47,\" said Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, a Kentucky-based LGBTQ+ advocacy group. Gay rights advocates in Kentucky have made some inroads at local levels while a so-called \"statewide fairness\" measure has been a nonstarter in the Republican-dominated legislature. Republican state Rep. Jason Nemes said Wednesday lawmakers should find the right balance that protects religious rights without going so far that it would \"effectively obliterate fairness ordinances.\" Rawlings offered to work on the bill's language to ease those concerns. Nemes, one of the bill's cosponsors, expressed support for his hometown's fairness ordinance. A catalyst for the measure, he said, was the case of a Muslim woman who said she was made to remove her hijab in front of men for her jail booking photo, a violation of her religious rights. The woman was arrested along with several others at a protest in Louisville over immigration issues. \"Ultimately, this bill seeks to ensure that religious rights are adequately protected,\" Rawlings said. \"HB47 ensures that Kentucky courts will use the most accommodating language to ensure that religious Kentuckians have a fair day in court.\" Opponents questioned the need for the bill, saying religious freedoms have strong constitutional protections. Kentucky already has one of the country's strongest religious freedom laws, Hartman said. They warned that the measure would lead to lawsuits that ultimately could weaken protections for some of the state's most vulnerable citizens. \"I do have a strong Christian faith and background,\" said Democratic state Rep. Keturah Herron. \"However, I do think that we have to be very careful when we say that, based on your religious belief, that you're allowed to discriminate against people. That is not what we need to be doing here in this commonwealth nor across the nation, and basically, this is what this bill says.\"",

    "text": "Nadal als neuer Zverev-Coach? Boris Becker äußert Warnung\nAlexander Zverev könnte bald einen bedeutenden Trainerwechsel vollziehen. Boris Becker bewertet dies als gute Lösung – äußert jedoch auch warnende Worte.\nMünchen – Alexander Zverev könnte bald unter der Anleitung von Toni Nadal, dem langjährigen Trainer und Onkel von Rafael Nadal, trainieren. Ursprung dieser Spekulationen ist, dass Zverev in der Rafa Nadal Academy auf Mallorca gesichtet wurde. Boris Becker hat sich im Podcast „Becker Petkovic“ zu dieser möglichen Zusammenarbeit geäußert und zeigt sich begeistert.\nBecker äußert sich zu Nadal als möglichen neuen Trainer für Zverev\nBecker, der sechsmalige Grand-Slam-Sieger, sieht in Toni Nadal eine „Top-Wahl“ für Zverev. „Wenn es denn wahr ist, dass Toni Nadal der neue Trainer von Sascha Zverev ist, dann hat er alles richtig gemacht“, sagte die Tennislegende.\nEr betont die immense Erfahrung, die Toni Nadal mitbringt – schließlich hat dieser seinen Neffen Rafael zu zahlreichen Grand-Slam-Siegen geführt. „Er weiß, wie man Grand Slams gewinnt. Er hat jeden Grand Slam als Trainer schon einmal gewonnen. Toni ist mit allen Wassern gewaschen“, so Becker weiter.\nDisziplin und Respekt: Die „harte spanische Schule“\nBecker hat neben all der Begeisterung aber auch ein paar warnende Worte für Zverev, denn „Toni ist ein Disziplinfanatiker“, erklärt Becker. „Er erwartet Pünktlichkeit und Respekt vor dem gesamten Tennissport.“ Dass muss Zverev Nadal entgegenbringen um die „harte spanische Schule“ zu bestehen. Nadals Methoden sind in Fachkreisen auch nicht unumstritten.\nNeben Toni Nadal könnte auch Rafael Nadal eine wertvolle Rolle als Mentor für Zverev übernehmen. Becker sieht darin einen bedeutenden Impuls: „Wenn Rafael Nadal über Tennis redet, dann muss auch Sascha Zverev mal zuhören und ihm das glauben.“ Diese Kombination aus Erfahrung und Mentoring könnte Zverev helfen, seine Grand-Slam-Ambitionen zu verwirklichen.\nZverev plagt sich mit mentalen Problemen\nZverev offenbarte nach dem enttäuschenden Erstrunden-Aus in Wimbledon mentale Probleme und kündigte eine mehrwöchige Pause, sowie generelle Veränderungen an. Der deutsche Tennisstar hat seine Teilnahme am Turnier in Gstaad abgesagt, um sich auf die kommenden Masters-Turniere vorzubereiten. Ob Toni Nadal tatsächlich als Trainer verpflichtet wird, bleibt abzuwarten.\nDie Tenniswelt wartet gespannt auf die Entwicklungen in Zverevs Karriere. Eine Zusammenarbeit mit Toni Nadal könnte den erhofften Aufschwung bringen und Zverevs Weg zu einem Grand-Slam-Titel ebnen. Der nächste Auftritt, voraussichtlich in Toronto könnte Aufschluss über die zukünftige Trainerkonstellation geben. (hbr)",

    "text": "Ciudad del Vaticano. El papa Francisco instó a las partes en conflicto en Ucrania a negociar “antes de que las cosas empeoren”, en una entrevista difundida este sábado por la televisión suiza. “Creo que son más fuertes quienes ven la situación, quienes piensan en el pueblo, quienes tienen el coraje de izar la bandera blanca y negociar”, declaró el papa durante una entrevista de la radio televisión suiza RTS, realizada a inicios de febrero. \"La palabra negociar es una palabra valiente. Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van bien, necesitas tener el coraje de negociar\", añadió. \"Te da vergüenza, pero ¿con cuántas muertes terminará?\", continuó el jesuita argentino, de 87 años. \"Hoy, por ejemplo, en la guerra de Ucrania, hay muchos que quieren actuar como mediadores. Turquía se ofreció a ello. Y otros. No tengan vergüenza de negociar antes de que las cosas empeoren\", instó. El presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, afirmó el viernes que su país estaba dispuesto a acoger conversaciones de paz entre Kiev y Moscú, tras una reunión con su par ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, en Estambul. En las primeras semanas de la guerra, que empezó con la invasión rusa de Ucrania el 24 de febrero de 2022, Turquía había acogido negociaciones de paz entre ambos países, aunque estas fracasaron. Los periodistas también le preguntaron sobre la guerra entre Israel y el movimiento islamista Hamás en la Franja de Gaza. “La guerra la hacen dos, no uno. Los irresponsables son estos dos que hacen la guerra”, contestó.",
