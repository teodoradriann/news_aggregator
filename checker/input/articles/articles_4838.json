This order was imposed by the Finance Ministry in relation to alleged losses incurred through fraudulent government-to-government (G-to-G) rice contracts—a controversy that has entangled Yingluck in legal battles since 2017.

This order was imposed by the Finance Ministry in relation to alleged losses incurred through fraudulent government-to-government (G-to-G) rice contracts—a controversy that has entangled Yingluck in legal battles since 2017. Prawit Boothiam, who serves as a vice president of the court, confirmed that significant headway has been made on the case, which has been actively under the court's consideration since 2021. Prawit expressed optimism about reaching a conclusion before the year ends. The contentious issue began with a 2017 Supreme Court ruling, which sentenced Yingluck to five years in prison, in absentia, for her alleged mismanagement of the rice subsidy scheme. Nevertheless, she had already left Thailand, contending that the military government, which ousted her in 2014, would treat her unfairly. In the wake of the sentencing, the Ministry of Finance mandated a hefty 35 billion baht compensation from Yingluck for the purported financial damages linked to the G-to-G rice deals. Yingluck countered this directive by filing an appeal with the Central Administrative Court, which ruled in her favour in 2021. The court's decision invalidated the Finance Ministry's compensation demand on grounds that the responsibility for the scheme did not rest solely with her, but also involved the Cabinet and the National Rice Policy Committee. The Central Administrative Court acknowledged that while Yingluck was aware of the G-to-G rice contracts, there was no concrete evidence to suggest she was informed about the corrupt practices linked to the sale of rice under those contracts. Unperturbed, the Finance Ministry proceeded to challenge this ruling, escalating the matter to the Supreme Administrative Court, which has since been meticulously examining the case. The upcoming verdict is highly anticipated, not least because it will cap off years of legal wrangling and speculation about Yingluck’s accountability and involvement in the high-profile rice pledging scheme. As the verdict draws near, it represents not just the denouement of Yingluck’s long-standing legal saga but also a significant moment in the legal interpretation of ministerial accountability and executive responsibility within Thai politics, reported The Nation. -- 2025-03-06\n-\n-\nPopular in The Pub\n-",

    "title": "The Concern With A Live-Action R-Rated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles",
    "text": "In a surprising turn of events, Paramount has confirmed that they were produce a live-action R-rated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! This is actually an adaptation of the comic, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Last Ronin, with the synopsis of the story being, “Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost.”\nThe new live-action film is still developing so a cast and director have yet to be announced, but Tyler Burton Smith has been confirmed to pen the script for the upcoming feature. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been a property that’s aimed at kids. At least when it comes to television and movies. The sudden shift in the long-running franchise does seem jarring and though it’s being adapted from a well-received comic, there’s still some concern about the new TMNT film.\nThe TMNT Live-Action Films Have Failed To Work Some properties just aren’t meant to be in live-action. There’s been earnest efforts in past incarnations of the TMNT films, with the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie in 1990 having a fond place in everyone’s heart. There’s no denying that the live-action films haven’t particularly done the characters and world justice. The aesthetic and look of the turtles themselves has also been a contributing factor on why the live action films just haven’t worked.\nThe turtles always looked like men in costumes. The 90’s films looked too fake and the Michael Bay produced films had the turtles as way too big. It’s also that the style didn’t really capture the essence of a TMNT comic. Sure, they got the basic look correct, but what made last year’s TMNT work is that they wisely opted to go the animation route. That allowed for the city and characters to feel vibrant and lively; plus, the turtles never feel out of place because they feel right at home in animation.\nCan Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Last Ronin work? Yes! It just won’t be as lively as the comics because there’s only so much you do in live-action. It would cooler if they opted to do an anime version instead of live-action. I haven’t read the comics, but the premise sounds really cool and doing a comic style adaptation (that’s opposite of what 2023’s TMNT did) would bring the best of the material.\nThe Concern With Going Live-Action The Turtles have always bordered on being R-rated. These are ninjas who slice and dice there opponents and some of the stories have been rather dark. Again, I’m not familiar with The Last Ronin comic, but I love the general concept about it. The concern here lies with the writer using the R-rated aspects to add more cursing, blood, or other adult things that they can get away with.\nDo I expect this to be an action and explosive fest like the Michael Bay produced films? No and writer Tyler Burton Smith is a good choice to adapt the adult comic, but that can all be changed if the director decides to make some changes of his own. The focus should always be on the story itself. Logan did an excellent transition into a R-rated film. That movie doesn’t rely on excessive gore and violence to get it’s message across. As long as this adaptation doesn’t put the emphasize of action and violence then it could turn out to be something special.\nWill These Characters Actually Feel Like Teenagers? It’s safe to assume that the turtles this time around feel like the same characters as the one in the animated 2023 feature. It sounds crazy, but the recent TMNT’s was so great because they captured the teenage part so well. Originally, these characters were made as a parody of the superhero genre. That’s a big why the teenage aspect works because of the level of immaturity that comes with that age.\nThis is perhaps a small nitpick as this film is geared towards adults. However, the satire edge show never be lost in the upcoming TMNT film. With the R-rating, there’s new ground that they can cover in the superhero realm because the boundaries are allowed to be pushed. It would also be great to never forget the teenage aspect as well. The characters don’t have to be reminiscent of ones in the series or recent film, but it’s an important element that’s defined these characters for over 30 years. An adult TMNT film does have some strong potential, let’s hope that it can be the first great live-action adaptation.",

    "text": "Surely, as most techies maybe aware of, robotic process automation (RPA) or, simply, robotics, is so prevalent nowadays in all sectors of the economy of the developed countries in the world. Though there are stark disparities in approaches, these developed countries’ businesses are continuously gearing up for different methodologies that would enhance their capabilities. The fact is, according to Kearney’s (one the world’s ten largest consulting firms) Senior Partner Ettore Pastore, there shall be “no slowdown in automation, information technology (IT), digitization or artificial intelligence (AI) investments for the foreseeable future.”\nNotably, two years ago, we keenly examined several start-ups and found out that most of them were all tech or tech-driven companies. Airtable planned to launch more low code features so that users may be able “to build inside the platform without writing code.” Replicant raised money for its “autonomous call center.” Its AI bot (with a conversational and “human-like” voice) was touted to resolve simple issues over the phone. While intricate issues are routed to a human agent, it was said that “the bot employs deep learning to understand the intricacies of humans’ sentences, and can fully resolve certain customer service inquiries.”\nOf these start-ups, for us, job-wise, Replicant’s technology was really worth watching then and now. For one, it is not the only company that develops AI bots. This simply means, the supply of AI bots will soon inundate the BPO industry (call centers, in particular). Therefore, our call center agents’ jobs will be at risk.\nWell, we can always say, human intelligence is irreplaceable. Yes, that is quite accurate because bots can’t handle complex issues. The question, however is, how many do we need for jobs that require human intelligence. Remember, it is an undeniable fact that some of our call center agents are just handling repetitive tasks or transactional work. Concerns or tasks that can be easily undertaken by AI bots.\nIndeed, with the pace by which robotics and AI is developing, as a country whose economy largely depends on services, the future of jobseekers could be bleak or scary. Remember, just a we thought that robots or AIs can simply take care of menial or repetitive jobs or those done by high school graduates or college undergraduates, the highly equipped professionals could be into stiff competition too.\nMarkedly, The Business Research Company reported recently that the global market research industry today is worth an estimated US$87.7 billion. It is expected to reach US$102.88 in 2033 or a CAGR of 4.1% from 2024 to 2033 (base year is 2033). A huge industry, it goes back to practically a century ago, when in the 1920s, American psychologist Daniel Starch “created the world’s first market research study.” Notably, for a century, finance and accounting professionals as well as data analysts and marketing experts dominated this industry. Simply put, they were milking companies especially those manufacturing consumer goods.\nMoving forward, the situation could be different as a 2018-established, Singapore-based company, Ai Palette, provides AI-powered market research with real-time predictive analytics. Direct competitors like ZoomInfo Sales, Trajaan and Brandwatch Consumer Intelligence are also deploying a “variety of technology to comb through consumer data and marketing trends.” These head-turner companies were able to arouse interest of global consumer goods manufacturing giants Nestlé, Pepsico and Kellogg.\nTruly, the pace of change is remarkably fast. So that, regardless of profession or occupation we are in, the need to embrace this development is paramount. We need to realize that in the coming years, intelligent systems will take all clerical and repetitious tasks from us. We must further realize that these systems will even take over more and more decision-making tasks from us, humans.\nTherefore, there is a need to exploit these powerful technologies. How? By, first, understanding it. Just like any tool we can find in our households, we can’t use it if we do not understand how it works and what it can do. We don’t have to know how it is being made. We only need to know their distinctive characteristics and how they can help solve real and pressing problems.\nAdmittedly, AI bots or systems are already powerful today and are capable of improving quickly. It can surely surpass us in many aspects. If there is any consolation, it is the fact that we are human beings. That we are emotional beings. That AI bots or systems can’t replicate that.\nTherefore, what we essentially need to do now is to recognize the strengths and limitations of both artificial intelligence and human intelligence and find ways to work together.",

    "text": "La actriz y presentadora de televisión Maribel Guardia cantará en concierto en Costa Rica , con el propósito de ayudar al padre Sergio Valverde y la Asociación Obras del Espíritu Santo en uno de sus más ambiciosos proyectos: la construcción de dos edificios destinados a los Albergues Juveniles de la Alegría, en Cristo Rey, San José. Valverde, director de Obras del Espíritu Santo, confirmó a La Nación que la cantante costarricense saldrá de México, país donde reside actualmente, exclusivamente para participar en el concierto benéfico Torretón de la Alegría, que se celebrará el 29 de setiembre en el Palacio de los Deportes, en Heredia. En diciembre pasado, Maribel Guardia participó en una fiesta navideña para 2.000 niños en situación de riesgo social, también organizada por las Obras del Espíritu Santo. Desde entonces, el padre Sergio la invitó a unirse a la iniciativa del Torretón de la Alegría. “Cuando ella vino acá (Costa Rica) para mí fue una sorpresa, una bendición que ella haya venido. Ella es muy conocida, famosa, tan linda por fuera y por dentro. Me impactó cuando me habló de la muerte de su hijo. Es una artista muy famosa, pero mujer y mamá ante todo. Cuando le expliqué el proyecto para recaudar fondos ella dijo inmediatamente que sí”, agregó Valverde. La primera edición del Torretón de la Alegría se llevará a cabo bajo el lema “Yo dono por las torres”. El evento comenzará a las 2 p. m. y finalizará a las 6 p. m., con la participación de otros artistas como Malpaís , Gaviota, Los Ajenos, Éditus, Bernal Villegas y Pedro Capmany. Las entradas para asistir al concierto se venderán a través de bonos, los cuales se utilizarán para adquirir los materiales de construcción de las torres. El primero costará ¢7.000, lo que equivale a la compra de un saco de cemento; el segundo tendrá un valor de ¢20.000 para un tarro de pintura; y el tercero será de ¢75.000, destinado a la compra de una puerta. Según informó el sacerdote, las entradas pueden adquirirse de manera presencial en las instalaciones de las Obras del Espíritu Santo y próximamente a través del sitio web de eticket.

    "text": "Túnel faz parte de uma operação de construção de sistemas de esgotos ligado ao Oceano Pacífico.\nTrinta e um trabalhadores foram resgatados depois de um túnel industrial ter desabado em Wilmington, Los Angeles, nos EUA, avança o The Mirror.\nDe acordo com a mesma fonte, a derrocada ocorreu a cerca de seis quilómetros de distância do único ponto de acesso ao túnel, que faz parte de uma operação de construção de sistemas de esgotos ligado ao Oceano Pacífico, e que ficará a cerca de 137 metros de profundidade. Os trabalhadores perderam a comunicação pelas 20h00 locais (04h00 em Lisboa).\nSegundo as autoridades, citadas pelo The Mirror, não há registo de feridos nem de trabalhadores desaparecidos.\nMais de 100 bombeiros estiveram no local.

Dicha huelga fue declarada ilegal y fue cancelada, pero el descontento de los trabajadores no aminoró, traduciéndose en una manifestación celebrada el 25 julio frente a la puerta del Ayuntamiento.\nEn la SER hemos hablado con David Fernández, administrador de Casty en Talavera. Acusaba a CCOO de alterar la opinión de los trabajadores a través de un video en redes, para que votasen en contra de ese preacuerdo entre el sindicato y la empresa, para así poder formar parte de la mesa de negociaciones en ese nuevo convenio. \"El propio día de las votaciones había gente de CCOO en la puerta para decirle a los trabajadores que votasen que no\", afirmaba Fernández\nRecalca que CCOO no tiene legitimidad para negociar ese convenio, ya que \"ni siquiera forma parte del comité de empresa\". Explicó que la huelga finalmente fue desconvocada porque el Juzgado de lo Social de Talavera le dio la razón a la empresa, ya que ya se estaba negociando un convenio con el sindicato responsable.\nEl código iframe se ha copiado en el portapapeles\nHoy por Hoy Matinal Talavera (07/08/2025)\nFernández hablaba de las medidas que estaban incluidas dentro de este nuevo convenio, una de ellas es la subida del 8% en el salario de toda la plantilla, en algunos casos dependiendo de la categoría por encima del 12%. También, confirmaba una reducción de las horas trabajadas a lo largo del año, la incorporación de nuevos pluses y la introducción de un nuevo sistema de categorías para que haya posibilidad de ascender en la empresa.\nFrente a las acusaciones que se hacían desde CCOO acerca de condiciones de trabajo bajo temperaturas extremas por debajo de los 40 grados, el administrador las ha tachado de 'completamente falsas'. Afirma que sí existen túneles de congelación que funcionan a menos de 40 grados, pero que no entra nadie ni se necesita de ningún trabajador dentro de esos túneles. \"Es más, al ser una fábrica de helados se puede pensar que se trabaja a temperaturas extremas, todo lo contrario, nuestros empleados de producción trabajan a temperaturas entre los 14 y los 16 grados\", reafirmaba el administrador.",

    "text": "POLITICO reporter Heidi Przybyla took to MSNBC on Thursday to express her disdain over the fact that Trump supporters do not believe that rights are gifts granted to citizens by the [state](https://thenationalpulse.com/tag/victoria-nuland/) but rather by God. Przybyla, 50, said: “The one thing that unites all of them — because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump — but the thing that unites them as [Christian](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/02/19/megan-rapinoe-somebody-needs-to-check-on-christians-theyre-not-okay/) nationalists, not [Christians](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/01/19-ags-object-to-biden-wh-proposal-that-could-ban-christians-fostering-children/) by the way, because [Christian](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/08/28/tucker-biden-hates-hungary-russia-for-being-christian-nations/) nationalists is [sic] very different, is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court. They come from God.” Observers familiar with the Declaration of Independence and the history of the founding of the United States of America were quick to point out that the idea “that our rights as Americans… come from God” is the very basis on which the country was founded. The Declaration of Independence states: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” Ms. Przybyla did not mention if she was familiar with the Declaration of Independence. Here [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] — Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [February 23, 2024]",

    "text": "Des résultats supérieurs dans des conditions de luminosité extrêmement faibles, surpassant les technologies de vision par ordinateur conventionnelles\nSHANGHAI, Chine–(BUSINESS WIRE)–VeriSilicon (688521.SH) a dévoilé aujourd’hui sa PI de traitement de signal d’image (ISP) de série ISP9000, une solution ISP intégrée à l’IA de nouvelle génération conçue pour répondre à l’évolution des exigences des applications de vision intelligente. Construite sur une architecture flexible optimisée pour l’IA, l’ISP9000 offre une qualité d’image exceptionnelle, une gestion multi-capteurs à faible latence et une intégration transparente de l’IA, ce qui la rend idéale pour les cas d’utilisation avancés, tels que les machines intelligentes, les caméras de surveillance et les PC d’IA.\nGrâce à ses capacités ISP basées sur l’IA, la PI de série ISP9000 de VeriSilicon offre une qualité d’image supérieure. Elle intègre des algorithmes avancés de réduction du bruit par l’IA (AI NR), combinant la réduction du bruit 2D et 3D multi-échelle avec la réduction du bruit chromatique (CNR) dans le domaine YUV dans une architecture de réduction du bruit multi-domaine. Cela permet de minimiser efficacement le bruit tout en préservant les détails, en particulier dans des conditions de très faible luminosité. La prise en charge du traitement HDR (plage dynamique élevée) à triple exposition et de la compression de la plage dynamique, avec un pipeline de 20 bits, garantit que les scènes à plage dynamique élevée conservent les détails essentiels dans les zones lumineuses et sombres. En outre, les fonctions 3A de l’ISP9000, notamment l’exposition automatique (AE), la mise au point automatique (AF) et la balance des blancs automatique (AWB), prennent en charge jusqu’à 25 régions d’intérêt configurables (ROI), ce qui permet la détection et la reconnaissance d’objets assistées par l’IA. Les utilisateurs peuvent en outre intégrer des bibliothèques 3A tierces, ce qui permet d’adapter les algorithmes 3A aux besoins d’applications spécifiques.\nL’ISP9000 prend en charge les configurations multi-capteurs et exploite les mécanismes de gestion multi-contexte (MCM) et de découpage de trame accélérés par le matériel pour permettre une commutation efficace des flux de données. Cela garantit la stabilité des flux de données multi-capteurs tout en offrant une faible latence et un bon rapport coût-efficacité. Prenant en charge jusqu’à 16 capteurs, l’ISP9000 intègre la PI d’interface vidéo VI200 de VeriSilicon pour une connectivité transparente avec les interfaces MIPI Rx courantes. Son architecture multicœur évolutive prend en charge le traitement haute performance jusqu’à 8K à 30 fps et 4K à 120 fps. Grâce à l’interface FLEXA SBI de VeriSilicon, l’ISP9000 permet une transmission optimisée des données vers les encodeurs vidéo, les unités de traitement des réseaux neuronaux (NPU) ou les processeurs d’affichage, ce qui permet d’optimiser les solutions de sous-systèmes.\nDe plus, l’ISP9000 est équipé d’AcuityPercept de VeriSilicon, un système de réglage automatique de l’ISP basé sur l’IA, afin d’améliorer ses capacités de vision intelligente. Contrairement aux réglages traditionnels axés sur la qualité de l’image perçue par l’homme, AcuityPercept optimise les paramètres ISP pour une meilleure reconnaissance des objets dans le pipeline AI/NPU, en s’adaptant aux algorithmes spécifiques de l’IA et aux exigences de l’application.\n« Alors que l’IA est de plus en plus intégrée dans les appareils dans un large éventail d’applications, et avec les progrès rapides de la robotique, la demande d’ISP de nouvelle génération pour répondre aux exigences évolutives des produits ne cesse de croître », déclare Weijin Dai, directeur de la stratégie, vice-président exécutif et directeur général de la division PI chez VeriSilicon. « En plus d’offrir une qualité d’image élevée et une faible consommation d’énergie, les ISP de nouvelle génération doivent prendre en charge efficacement plusieurs capteurs avec une commutation de contexte rapide et une faible latence, et optimiser la sortie pour les NPU et la vision humaine. Ils doivent également permettre un réglage automatique en conjonction avec les NPU de perception des cibles. L’ISP9000 a été conçu en tenant compte de ces exigences et a été développé en étroite collaboration avec des clients de premier plan. En intégrant la technologie de l’IA, l’ISP9000 permet d’obtenir une qualité d’image exceptionnelle dans des conditions de très faible luminosité, dépassant ainsi les capacités des technologies traditionnelles de vision par ordinateur. »\nÀ propos de VeriSilicon\nVeriSilicon s’engage à fournir à ses clients des services de silicium personnalisés, complets et uniques, basés sur une plateforme, ainsi que des services de licences PI pour semi-conducteurs en tirant parti de sa PI interne de semi-conducteurs.
