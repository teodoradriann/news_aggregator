    "title": "AUS vs WI 1st Test: Josh Hazlewood stars, Australia claim 10-wicket win",
    "text": "Josh Hazlewood claimed his 11th five-wicket total in Test matches as Australia completed a 10-wicket win over West Indies on Friday before lunch on the third day of the first Test. Australia dismissed the West Indies for 120 in the 13th over of the day on Friday, leaving the home side needing just 26 runs to win. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Steven Smith (11) and Usman Khawaja (9) easily completed that total for Australia, although Khawaja retired hurt after being hit by a bouncer with Australia needing one run to win. Marnus Labuschagne hit the winning run two balls later. Hazlewood already had four for 18 at the start of the day, as he helped Australia reduce the West Indies to 73 for six in its second innings before stumps on the second day. Australia led by 95 runs on the first innings after making 283 in reply to the West Indies 188.\nThanks mate! Steve Smith gives Shamar Joseph a hand with his laces #SpiritOfCricket #AUSvWI pic.twitter.com/HQEzKi6Fl8 — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) January 19, 2024 It's nice to have the weekend off now. It's nice as a group to play on that wicket. It felt like there was enough there the whole game,\" Hazlewood said. I felt I bowled just as well in the first half of the summer with no result. The wickets have been really good and playing with this team, it feels relentless and the pressure just builds all the time. Australia captain Pat Cummins said, It was a wicket where you always felt like there might be a ball that nips and you were in the game even when someone was scoring a few runs.\"\nThe big fella (Hazlewood) really turned it on for us this week. We had a decent lead but not a huge lead and he took the game away from them in one spell really. The big question at the start of the day was whether the West Indies would be able to make Australia bat again. It began to look unlikely when Mitchell Starc dismissed Joshua da Silva (18) and Alzarri Joseph (16) and Hazlewood bowled Gudakesh Motie (3) to leave the West Indies 94 for nine, still needing one run to avoid an innings defeat.\nAlso Read WI vs IND 1st ODI Playing 11: Ishan Kishan preffered over Sanju Samson IND vs WI 2nd Test playing 11, live match time, live telecast in India IND vs AUS, World Cup 2023: Revisiting 2003 final, that broke Indian hearts AUS vs PAK Test: How lift malfunctioning stopped play after Lunch at MCG WI vs IND 3rd ODI Playing 11, live match time, live streaming in India Arthur, Bradburn, Puttick resign from their roles in Pakistan cricket board Pakistan board asked not to offer long-term contract to Mohammad Hafeez Pakistan board issues NOC to four players returning from injury layoffs ICC Under 19 World Cup 2024 live telecast and streaming, commentators' list IND vs ENG: England Lions pin India to mat despite Patidar's quick 140 Corridor of uncertainty!

Joseph already was a star of the match for his 36 in the first innings and his five 94 on debut. He hit three boundaries on Friday to add a little to the West Indies lead before he was the last man out. West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said Shamar Joseph was a joy to be around. He's full of energy and he makes me laugh a lot, Brathwaite said. He has a lot of talent, a lot of skill and he can score some runs as well. I thought our bowlers did extremely well to bowl out Australia for less than 300. We obviously didn't bat well both innings. Our top order didn't get going.\"\nThe second and final test between the teams begins January 25 in Brisbane, a day-night match at the Gabba.

    "text": "Is Caeleb Dressel Confident in Clean Olympics? ‘No, Not Really’ [David Rieder - Senior Writer](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/author/davidr/) Is Caeleb Dressel Confident in Clean Olympics? ‘No, Not Really’ Within the last three months, accomplished international swimmers have heavily criticized the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and World Aquatics for a lack of transparency after 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine in early 2021. Two days before the start of the [Olympic swimming competition](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/meet/2024-olympic-games-coverage-paris), one of the most accomplished swimmers in history has publicly stated his own displeasure with the situation. At a press conference Thursday in Paris, Caeleb Dressel was asked whether he had confidence he would be competing in a clean Games. “No, not really,” Dressel said. He paused, then continued, “I don’t think they have given us enough evidence to support how this case was handled.” Dressel’s blunt answer was a sharp contrast to the many swimmers understandably attempting to focus on their own performances in the days before competition begins. More notably, he made his comments in a press conference that World Aquatics organized, and he was sharing the stage with the two biggest figures in that organization, President Husain Al-Musallam and Executive Director Brent Nowicki. Neither appeared surprised when they heard Dressel’s reaction. Minutes later, after Dressel and his fellow swimmers had left the room, Al-Musallam and Nowicki weighed in. Al-Musallam, perhaps neglecting the fact that Dressel joins the likes of [Katie Ledecky, Zac Stubblety-Cook and Lilly King as Olympic champions to express public criticism of the organization’s conduct](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/chinese-doping-controversy-hovering-over-paris-games/), took an optimistic view of the situation. “First, the rules apply to everyone,” Al-Musallam said. “There is no exception. Secondly, to gain the trust of the athletes, we have the trust of the athletes. Some athletes have doubts, and they have a different view.” Al-Musallam then added that World Aquatics must focus on education regarding its rules, although it was not clear how he hopes to further inform athletes. Nowicki had a more somber view of the situation, realizing that [his organization](https://www.worldaquatics.com/) had significant work to do and changes to make to satisfy athletes, but he expressed optimism of a less contentious future, perhaps as soon as the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. “I think trust is a process, and I think we have to not look at it subjectively or individualistically and look at just one person’s level of trust is. We have to look at it holistically,” Nowicki said. “We’ll work again tirelessly every day to regain that trust. I think we’ll do that with the perspective of all of our sports, all of our athletes. We hope that we have a different answer in LA.”",

Uma [derrota por 2-0, frente a um rival de sempre e ainda para mais... em casa](https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/jogo/aominuto/arsenal/west-ham-united/13804580?tab=aominuto). Foi um daqueles jogos em que tudo o que podia correr mal, de facto correu. O West Ham, que está a fazer um excelente campeonato e subiu ao sexto lugar, entrou praticamente a ganhar, quando logo aos 13 minutos Soucek abriu o marcador. Um golo caricato, aliás, em que Gabriel Magalhães alivia uma bola contra Zinchenko e permite Bowen assistir Soucek para um golo fácil, com a baliza aberta. Que confusão, mas deu mesmo golo 😅 Souček 🏴 [@premierleague]| [@Arsenal]0 x 1 [@WestHam] [#PremierELEVEN] [pic.twitter.com/3eJ3jFHMWr] — DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) [December 28, 2023] O West Ham, pouco depois, ainda perdeu um dos jogadores mais importantes, quando Lucas Paquetá teve de ser substituído por lesão, mas o Arsenal pouco conseguiu criar na primeira parte. A formação de Mikel Arteta sentiu o golo a abrir o jogo do adversário. Na segunda parte, aí sim as coisas foram diferentes. O Arsenal criou várias ocasiões para marcar, Gabriel Jesus cabeceou por cima da barra, Saka e Odegaard obrigaram Areola a excelentes defesas e Nelson atirou ligeiramente ao lado. Saka ainda caiu dentro da área e ficou a pedir penálti, mas o VAR nada assinalou, e acabou por ser o West Ham a marcar novamente, aos 55 minutos, por Mavropanos. Já no período de descontos, quando muita gente tinha deixado as bancadas, o West Ham podia ter tornado o escândalo maior, mas David Raia defendeu o penáltido batido por Benrahma e evitou o 3-0. Nada que atenuasse a dor do Arsenal, porém. Hoje é dia de supresas 🤯 Mavropanos.— DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) 🏴 [@premierleague]| [@Arsenal]0 x 2 [@WestHam] [#PremierELEVEN] [pic.twitter.com/D92wLjJTpV] [December 28, 2023]",

    "text": "Swastika Mukherjee calls out Uber: When 'pet-friendly' isn't enough\nSwastika Mukherjee called out Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched 'pet-friendly' feature on their app.\nAmong the many challenges pet parents face, finding a reliable cab service to take their furry friends from one place to another remains a major hurdle. On Thursday, actress Swastika Mukherjee called out ride-hailing giant Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched ‘pet-friendly’ cab service.\nWhat actually happened\nChitrangada Singh, who runs the Dulaar Amanat Foundation, an NGO in Delhi, called out Uber for its ‘lack of compassion’ towards pet animals. She was frustrated with the company's newly launched ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which allows pets to accompany their owners but at a significantly higher price. For a regular five-kilometre ride to her mentioned destination, Uber quoted a price of Rs 150, whereas the same trip under ‘Uber Pet’ shot up to Rs 487 - almost three times the original fare.\nChitrangada booked an Uber Go from Chhawla, New Delhi, to Dwarka to take six rescued puppies to a pet clinic, one of whom was in critical condition. When the cab arrived, she placed the baskets with the pups inside. However, after entering the OTP, the driver asked what she was carrying. Upon learning they were puppies, he immediately refused the ride, insisting she cancel and book a ‘pet taxi’ instead.\nUntil that moment, Chitrangada hadn’t even been aware of the pet taxi feature.\n“I pleaded with him, explaining that it was a medical emergency and we needed help immediately. He said that if he had known we were taking dogs to the hospital, he wouldn’t have accepted the ride and insisted we remove the pups from the cab,” Chitrangada told India Today.\nWith no other option at hand, she tried booking a cab under the 'Uber Pet' feature but was shocked by its steep pricing. Following her experience, she demanded answers, particularly regarding the lack of detailed information about the size and layout of the pet-friendly taxis.\nSwastika Mukherjee, who closely works with Chitrangada's NGO, later shared her post on Instagram, which sparked a discussion online.\nIndia Today also tried to find out if there was any truth to these claims. We checked the pricing for both the features - 'Uber Sedan' and 'Uber Pet' - for a distance of about 4km, and this is what we found:\nWhat the policy says\nUber’s official website states that service animals are allowed at all times, while non-service animals are permitted at the driver’s discretion.\nUnder the ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which was introduced in Bengaluru last year, riders can travel with pets, but only one is allowed per ride.\nWhen India Today reached out to Uber, this is what a spokesperson said, “We introduced ‘Uber Pet’ to meet the growing demand from pet owners who want an easy way to travel using Uber with their furry companions. It ensures that there is a safe and convenient ride available when you are travelling with your pets while providing additional earning opportunities for drivers.”\n“The surcharge for ‘Uber Pet’ covers the costs associated with vehicle cleaning and maintenance to ensure that the car is ready and comfortable for subsequent riders,” he added.\nThe problem with ‘pet-friendly’\nChitrangada Singh’s experience is not an isolated one - pet parents across India frequently struggle with transportation, accommodations, and public spaces that claim to be pet-friendly but fall short in practice.\nAyush Das, a 20-year-old engineering student with five dogs, shares his frustration:\n\"Travelling with pets is a nightmare. Cabs, hotels, and even cafes often don’t allow them. You need to keep searching and enquiring before your needs and theirs (pets) align. Limited carriers like Air India permit pet travel, but securing train bookings is another hassle. We've stopped taking our pets out - not by choice, but due to a lack of options.\"\nRashi Narang, founder of pet-care brand Heads Up For Tails, emphasises the need for change: “Travelling with pets should be a positive experience, not a struggle. I hope for a future where all pets can travel safely and comfortably with their families.\"\nThe cost factor\nBeyond accessibility, affordability is another major hurdle for pet parents.\n\"Raising a pet today is like raising a child,\" Das adds. \"A 1kg pack of quality dog food costs around Rs 1,000 and lasts barely a week for an adult dog. Add grooming, vet visits, and other expenses - especially for specific breeds - and it becomes a significant financial commitment. While it may seem otherwise, having a pet is not a luxury for some, they do it out of sheer love and compassion,” he says.",
