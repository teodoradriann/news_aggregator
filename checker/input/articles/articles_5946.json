    "title": "PM Modi’s Russia Outreach Was Key In Averting Nuclear Crisis In 2022, Says US Report on Ukraine War",
    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi attend a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan September 16, 2022. (Reuters)\nWhen the world came close to a nuclear crisis in late 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, public outreach from world leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a crisis, CNN has reported, citing US officials.\nIn late 2022, the US began preparations for the possibility of Russia launching a nuclear strike on Ukraine, according to American news anchor and ex-government official Jim Sciutto. In his report, Sciutto revealed that the Biden administration shared serious concerns about the potential use of tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons by Russia. This worry stemmed from several alarming developments and sensitive information received by the US during the period.\nActing on the intel, the US National Security Council conducted a series of meetings to formulate contingency plans in a bid to preempt or deter potential nuclear actions. During the fall of 2022, as Ukrainian forces made significant advances against Russian-occupied territories, including Kherson in the south, the prospect of a nuclear response became increasingly plausible. The Biden administration perceived the potential loss of significant Russian forces as a catalyst for nuclear escalation.\nAmid these developments, Russia propagated a narrative surrounding a purported “Ukrainian dirty bomb threat,” according to the report. Despite international skepticism, the spread of this information heightened concerns within the Biden administration about potential Russian nuclear intentions. Additionally, western intel agencies intercepted communications among Russian officials explicitly discussing the possibility of a nuclear strike. While the exact nature of these discussions remained unclear, they contributed to a growing sense of apprehension within the US administration.\nThroughout late 2022, the US engaged in urgent diplomatic outreach, conveying its concerns directly to Russian counterparts and collaborating closely with allies to develop response strategies. Efforts were made to enlist the support of non-allies, such as China and India, in discouraging Russia from pursuing nuclear options. “One of the things we did was not only message them directly, but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” a senior US official told Sciutto.\nCiting US officials, CNN reported that, “outreach and public statements from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a crisis.” It was the same period, when on the sidelines of a regional security bloc summit in Uzbekistan, Modi famously told Russian President Vladimir Putin that now was not a time for war. “I know that today’s era is not an era of war, and I have spoken to you on the phone about this,” Modi told Putin, which was later echoed by other world leaders.",

    "title": "Living a double life: Challenges faced by Israeli reservists",
    "text": "(JNS) On with the uniform. Off with the uniform. On with the boots. Off with the boots. On with the gun, off with the gun.\nMembers of Israel’s miluim—its reserve units—don’t always know when they’re going to get “the call.”\n“The call,” as every miluim family knows, means that it’s time to suit up and set off to join your unit’s newest assignment.\nBefore Oct. 7, life as a reservist in the IDF wasn’t a huge burden, most will say. Often as not, it was a couple weeks each year with training, briefings, and every few years, some operational duty.\nBut since the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip began, an estimated 350,000 reservists have been called up for active duty—the largest number in Israel’s history. And now, with increasing needs for soldiers in the north as well as the south, the Knesset has approved raising the upper age limits of service. So more reservists are expected to be on active duty than ever before, ricocheting between their military selves and their civilian ones.\nWhich can be downright dizzying and disorienting.\nTake Josh Bar-on. The tank commander and father of four turned 40 this spring as his unit wrapped up four months of shoring up the border of Gaza and several incursions inside, a time when he lost three close friends. He was called back to duty on Aug. 21.\nHe says he wished the war had never happened, “but I’m proud and honored to be taking part. On a national level, it’s the most meaningful thing I’ve ever done.”\nThen there’s Avihai Peretz, a 39-year-old digital marketer and web designer, and a father of four, who spent seven months serving first in the north and then in the Shimron in the Jezreel Valley. “We never know what we were going to encounter but we’ve tried to give both our families and our comrades strength, saying, ‘This is our time and our calling to protect this country.’”\nRabbi Betzalel Heller, a major in the reserves, was celebrating the holiday of Simchat Torah with his family on Oct. 7 when the alarm rang out across Jerusalem, and the dancing with the Torah was moved inside the synagogue’s safe room. By evening, Heller was suited up and on his way north to join his unit. In the nine months since, he’s served in the north and Gaza with a few weeks here and there at home with family.\nAny end in sight? “We don’t know,” says Heller. “But as long as we are at war, I’m in it.”\nYoni Tokayer got back from his Simchat Torah services to find his phone logging multiple calls from his commander. Within minutes, he was in uniform, telling his wife that he’d probably be gone anywhere from a week to a month. It was more like five months of active duty in a counter-terror unit near Ramla before he was able to return home.\nAnd, yes, he also expects to be called back: “It’s just a matter of when.”\n‘You’re an equal partner’\nIndeed the yo-yo miluim life puts pressure on the reservists and their children—for kids, even short daddy absences feel like forever—but often most intensely on their wives.\n“I know how hard it is for Rachel when I’m gone; balancing kids and work all alone, it takes a toll,” says Sam Griffin who at 34 is normally a hands-on dad to three young boys while his wife is a doctor who works long hours. But for Griffin, who’s spent five of the last nine months on guard duty on the Gaza border, the long-awaited homecomings also come with challenges. “She’s established her own schedule, but when I get home, the kids are excited—wanting to stay up late—and it breaks the routine.”\nAvidan Milevsky, a rabbi and psychologist who teaches at Ariel University in Samaria, points out that “a new family dynamic has developed in his absence, and it takes time for everyone to re-adjust. They need to re-adjust slowly, and have a lot of compassion for themselves and each other.”\nBut a bigger problem for the reservist returning home may be the radical change of focus. “You go from the big picture—protecting your country—to the small picture, like working or changing diapers,” says Griffin. “It’s hard to feel that same sense of purpose in those things.”\nKey to managing the flip-flop is an almost super-human resiliency, says psychologist Milevsky. And for the families as well. “You come and go, and the kids are confused,” says Peretz. “I can see the older ones are afraid but also full of pride, that their abba is a soldier who fights the bad people and saves the country.”\nFor Tova Heller, left alone with two toddlers and a tour business of the open-air Machane Yehuda market in Jerusalem that fizzled for lack of visitors, suddenly there was a flood of WhatsApp messages from other miluim wives—money to raise for her husband’s unit and multi-family events to organize. As her husband wrote to her from the north: “I’m in the reserves, you’re in the reserves. You’re a part of this mitzvah, you’re part of history. You’re an equal partner.”\n‘A dramatic chapter in our history’\nFor Peretz, the war pushed his music from dream to reality—and wound up being a force that’s helped him heal.\nHis song, “Miluim,” expresses “the dissonance between my daily life and my service and duty,” he says. And he was determined to share it, taking it on an American tour in March. “I’d always written about following your dreams but, with everything stopping us—money, what people might say—I never really followed mine.”\nUntil he was called up.\n“We’re IDF soldiers, and we don’t speak about feelings, but my music is a place where I can express them,” he says. “It’s healing for me, and I think it touches the people who hear it.”\nSometimes, this creative healing is a shared experience. For Tokayer, who with his wife, Nina, makes up the singing duo Yonina, it was his wife’s initiative. Left alone with four young children, “she was thinking that we both see the same stars even though we were far apart,” he says. The result: “Melaketet Kochavim” (“Gathering Stars”), which is “about finding light in the darkness.”\nBut recording his half proved difficult. “Every attempt, we’d have to jump to arrest someone or stop cars of terrorists,” he says. Still, the project itself helped. “In the army, you’re living minute to minute but just working on the song opened up a place where I could feel the meaning of what I was doing while I was doing it, and that’s pretty rare.”\nGriffin, a staff sergeant, says he’s “lucky to have art as an outlet.” Since reporting for duty in October, his portraits and landscapes have given way to soldiers entering booby-trapped buildings, Israelis who’d lost their homes and those who’d lost their lives.\n“These really reflect my current mindset,” he says. “That now, I’m a soldier as well as a husband, a dad and an artist.” (Visit Griffin’s website at: www.samgriffinart.com for paintings and information on this summer’s Jerusalem exhibit).\nBar-on’s podcast, “Giborim” (Hebrew for “heroes”) was also born of a need to wrestle with his wartime experience. “After the terrible things done to us, we’ve seen an awakening of Jewish pride,” he says. “The podcast introduces the listener to our unsung heroes, giving them even more Jewish pride to hang their hats on.”\nAn upcoming interview will feature one reservist who was part of the first hostage rescue, and another who showed up at the Nova festival and saved lives. “For me, it’s therapy,” says Bar-on. “I get a lot of strength from hearing about these ordinary people who’ve done amazing things they’d never been asked to do before. It makes me even prouder to be part of this people.”\nAnd sometimes, all you can do is write your way through. It had been nine years since Zach Millunchick had served full-time. But from October to February, he was back in—first in the north and then in Gaza. His observations and insights during those months knocked around his mind until he realized there was a book in there.\n“When I’d have a feeling weigh on me, writing it gave it shape and kept it from being overwhelming,” says the 32-year-old writer and translator. The book, written in Hebrew, will be titled 120 Days: Thoughts About the War by a Reserve Duty Tank Operator.\nBut what may come as a surprise is that a reservist has the right to pull out. Interestingly very few do, with many extending their service over the age limit. “Quitting would be giving up on your friends and on yourself, too,” says Peretz.\n“We’re now in a dramatic chapter in our history,” adds Heller, who as a rabbi and officer is often asked tough questions by his soldiers. “I tell them that someday our grandchildren will ask us about this war, and we’ll tell them about the explosions and the enemy rockets and drones over our heads.”\n“But we’ll also tell them about the prayers said in the north and in the heart of Gaza, the sense of brotherhood, the embrace of the entire people of Israel, and how, as hard as it is, knowing we did the right thing—something we’ll pass on to our family, forever.”\nTo read more content visit www.jns.org",

    "title": "Republicans push Biden to blacklist Chinese EV battery makers - E&E News by POLITICO",
    "text": "Republicans in both chambers of Congress are calling on the Biden administration to add two major Chinese EV battery makers working with companies such as Ford to an import ban list, accusing the corporations of using forced labor in their supply chains. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida; Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the new chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party; and their colleagues warned a top official at the Department of Homeland Security in two separate letters on Wednesday that leading Chinese electric vehicle battery manufacturers are relying on forced labor and should be blocked from importing goods into the U.S. “The Select Committee has uncovered indisputable evidence that Gotion High Tech and CATL have supply chains that are deeply connected to forced labor and the ongoing genocide of Uyghurs in China,” Moolenaar said in a statement. “That is why the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force must immediately add Gotion High Tech and CATL to the UFLPA Entity List and block the shipments of these companies from entering the United States.” Republican Rep. Mark Green, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, Darin LaHood of Illinois and Carlos Gimenez of Florida also signed the letters, which were sent to Robert Silvers, the agency’s undersecretary for strategy, policy, and plans. The letters zero in on two Chinese-owned companies. The [first focuses on China-based Gotion High Tech](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id= 18f-ee21-d6d1-a9bf-eeeb12030000), a maker of lithium-ion batteries partially owned by German automaker Volkswagen. Notably, Gotion Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of the company operating in Fremont, California, is pushing to build an EV battery plant in Michigan, about an hour north of Grand Rapids. Neither Gotion High Tech or Gotion immediately commented when asked about the letters. A [second letter](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id= 18f-ee23-d6d1-a9bf-eeebf9e90000) lays out a case against Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, the world’s largest electric vehicle battery maker, which is poised to provide technology for Ford’s $3.5 billion EV battery plant in Michigan. Under that agreement, CATL will license its EV battery technology to Ford, which has said it will operate the plant. CATL is also working to provide [faster charging batteries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-25/catl-working-with-tesla-on-fast-charging-cells-supplying-nevada) for Tesla in Nevada. CATL didn’t immediately respond when asked for comment, but Ford defended the arrangement and its requirements for upholding human rights standards. T.R. Reid, a spokesperson for Ford, emphasized that any supplier to Ford must comply with the company’s “supplier code of conduct,” which outlines the requirements and expectations around human rights, the environment and responsible materials sourcing. “As you know, we plan to license technology from CATL, and the U.S. plant where we intend to apply this technology to produce LFP EV batteries is being built and will be owned and run by Ford,” said Reid. “Whatever their relationships with us, all suppliers to Ford must comply with our supplier code of conduct.” “DHS responds to congressional correspondence directly via official channels, and the Department will continue to respond appropriately to congressional oversight,” said DHS spokesperson Naree Ketudat. ‘Deeply compromised’ Republicans in the letters laid out what they said is evidence that the companies’ sprawling supply chains — from minerals to EV battery components — are “deeply compromised” with ties to the Chinese province of Xinjiang, an area of the world where [federal officials have said](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/against-their-will-the-situation-in-xinjiang) forced labor practices are likely occurring. “Gotion’s supply chains are deeply compromised by links to entities whose goods, wares, articles, or merchandise are mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in [the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region],” the lawmakers wrote. The Republican lawmakers said the companies are likely violating the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, passed in 2021, which aims to prevent the importation of goods into the U.S. that are mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in the People’s Republic of China. In one letter, for example, Republicans highlighted what they say are ties between CATL and XPCC, a paramilitary organization that the federal government placed on the import ban list — also known as the [Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List](https://www.dhs.gov/uflpa-entity-list) — in the summer of 2022. In April, a top Labor Department official told the Congressional-Executive Commission on China said it’s incredibly difficult to conduct independent audits in the Xinjiang region to ensure human and labor rights are being upheld, and multinational companies should leave the region given concerns about forced labor. “Since you can’t do due diligence in Xinjiang or with Xinjiang workers, then you cannot responsibly operate there,” Thea Lee, deputy undersecretary for international affairs at the Labor Department, [told Sen. Jeff Merkley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOz7u5sDxBs) (D-Ore.) during the hearing. Bill Reinsch, a trade policy specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the federal government receives such requests and conducts an objective analysis before placing a company on the import ban list. Being placed on the list, he said, means a company is presumed guilty and any goods coming into the U.S. will likely be stopped at the border and detained until the company shows the products were not made with forced labor. Goods can then be allowed to come into the country if the company proves their innocence, shipped back, or held at the border in a warehouse, he said. “What it means under the law is if they’re put on the list, it means the imports from that company are presumed to have been made with forced labor,” said Reinsch. “Under the law, they can’t come in unless the importer can show they’re not made with forced labor.” Reporter Timothy Cama contributed.",
