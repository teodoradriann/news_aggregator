    "text": "Maduro orders defensive military exercises before the arrival of a British ship to the coast of Guyana Venezuela moves troops in the area even as the neighboring country denies ‘plans for offensive action’ The president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, has ordered to start “defensive actions” in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after the arrival of a British warship off the coast of Guyana. The vice-president of that country, Bharrat Jagdeo, has shortly after denied “plans for an offensive” against its neighbor, who [claims sovereignty over the Essequibo, a jungle territory rich in minerals and oil.](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-11/resistance-from-essequibo-we-will-defend-ourselves-if-venezuela-dares-to-invade-us.html) “These are routine measures that are planned for a long time, they are part of building defense capabilities. We do not plan to invade Venezuela, President Maduro knows that. We have no plans to take offensive action against Venezuela,” Jagdeo added. Maduro, who spoke about the territorial conflict during his New Year’s message, has qualified the presence of the British Navy ship as a “threat [...] against peace and sovereignty”. His government also denounced it as an act of “hostile provocation” and a violation of [the bilateral agreements signed in mid-December in St. Vincent and the Grenadines](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-15/venezuela-and-guyana-agree-not-to-resort-to-arms-to-settle-essequibo-dispute.html). A couple of weeks of apparent calm followed the meeting between Presidents Maduro and Irfaan Ali, organized by Brazil with the support of the countries of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), to defuse the escalation of tensions between Venezuela and Guyana over control of the Essequibo. Now, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has said in a statement that the arrival of the military vessel HMS Trent is “extremely serious” and follows [the declarations of Guyana’s allies such as the United Kingdom and the United States](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-07/us-conducts-flight-operations-in-guyana-after-venezuelas-referendum-on-the-essequibo-region.html) in the territorial dispute. “Venezuela urges the Guyanese authorities to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the vessel and to refrain from continuing to involve military powers in the territorial dispute.” The Venezuelan Armed Forces announced the operational deployment of 5,600 soldiers on the country’s eastern coast, which includes disputed territorial waters. “We are going with the best disposition, with the best attitude of a trained combatant to guard Venezuelan territory and exercise sovereignty”, said Ashraf Suleiman Gutiérrez, head of the Strategic Region of Integral Maritime Insular Defense. The beginning of the mobilization of ocean patrol boats, ships, missile boats, F-16 and Sukhoi fighter planes, amphibious and anti-aircraft defense vehicles, among other equipment, was broadcast on television and authorized live by Maduro dressed in military attire. In the midst of an internal whirlwind after the primaries in which [the Venezuelan opposition closed ranks around candidate María Corina Machado](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-07/maria-corina-machado-and-the-conquest-of-the-chavista-far-west.html), Maduro has dusted off [a two-century-old conflict with Guyana over the sovereignty of the Essequibo](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-09/venezuela-and-its-territory-a-national-trauma.html), an extensive territory of 160,000 square kilometers, five times the surface of Belgium, with important mineral and oil riches. In the maps of 1777 the border of the Captaincy General of Venezuela included this area. But it was British Guyana, and later independent Guyana, which ended up occupying this territory. After the Paris Arbitral Award of 1899, a document considered rigged by Venezuela, Guyana’s border was moved westward to keep that portion within its limits. For decades, this controversy was mediated at the request of the United Nations in the framework of the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and five years ago led to the International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to settle this conflict is rejected by Venezuela. One day after the opposition primaries which mobilized more than two million Venezuelans, Maduro announced [ a referendum for December 3 in which the annexation of the Essequibo was approved,](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-04/venezuela-government-claims-victory-in-referendum-to-annex-essequibo-increasing-tension-with-guyana.html) albeit with participation levels that have been questioned, due to the low mobilization seen in the streets and the absence of disaggregated results on the votes. Alarm bells went off in Latin America and were even discussed in an informal session of the UN Security Council. In spite of this, [Maduro pushed forward](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-06/venezuela-guyana-dispute-maduro-mobilizes-the-army-and-announces-annexation-of-essequibo.html) and appointed authorities in the region, ordered the registration of its citizens and decreed a new map of the country with the Essequibo. Guyana, which in recent years has granted oil concessions in the disputed waters, also followed suit with the hoisting of its flag in the disputed sector and the mobilization of its allies in the field of diplomacy. This is a simmering tension that [might be politically exploited by Chavismo,](https://english.elpais.com/opinion/2023-12-08/nicolas-maduro-maneuvers-with-guyana.html) according to several analysts, [in order to suspend the 2024 presidential elections,](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-05/with-its-referendum-on-essequibo-venezuelas-government-opens-a-new-front-to-ensure-absolute-control-until-the-2024-presidential-elections.html) in which it would be at a disadvantage if it is forced to comply with the democratic guarantees demanded by the international community, under the argument that an escalation with Guyana would force it to declare a state of emergency. After the meeting in St. Vincent and the Grenadines on December 14, the parties agreed to continue in dialogue and to avoid taking measures that could further complicate the situation. A couple of weeks later, the small Caribbean country was also the venue for the exchange of U.S. prisoners for [the businessman Alex Saab, ](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-26/alex-saab-and-the-path-towards-fair-elections-in-venezuela.html)arrested for money laundering in the United States, which accuses him of being a frontman for high-ranking officials of the Maduro government, but that Venezuela claims as a diplomat. The issue of the Essequibo, on which the Government deployed an intense propaganda campaign, seemed to be buried for a few weeks following the new steps taken in the negotiating table between Chavismo and the United States, which has relaxed its sanctions, in order for Maduro to move towards competitive elections in 2024, such as the possible enabling of Machado to compete freely; a matter on which a decision of the Supreme Court is expected this last week of 2023, just when the waters between Venezuela and Guyana seem to be choppy once again.

    "title": "Pourquoi Apple n’est-il pas intéressé par les bagues connectées ?",
    "text": "D’après le leader du marché des bagues connectées, la firme à la pomme n’est pas près de lancer son propre anneau. L’an dernier, [la réalité mixte avec l’Apple Vision Pro](https://leclaireur.fnac.com/article/504877-lapple-vision-pro-debarque-en-france-aujourdhui/). L’an prochain, la [maison connectée](https://www.fnac.com/Maison-connectee/shi511432/w-4) avec [un premier appareil encore intrigant](https://leclaireur.fnac.com/article/551150-apple-est-serieux-concernant-la-maison-connectee-et-son-premier-accessoire-arrive-bientot/). Apple donne l’impression d’être sur tous les fronts… sauf celui des bagues connectées que vient justement d’investir [Samsung](https://www.fnac.com/Samsung/m55616/w-4) avec sa Galaxy Ring. Apple ne nous passe pas la bague au doigt Tom Hale, le PDG d’Oura, leader du secteur des bagues connectées, a accordé une interview à CNBC lors du Web Summit de Lisbonne. Il y propose une analyse du marché et dresse un état des lieux de la concurrence. Pour lui, Apple ne serait tout simplement pas intéressé par les bagues connectées. En cause ? Un potentiel chevauchement avec l’Apple Watch qui nuirait à ses affaires. « [Apple] est peu convaincu par l’intérêt d’avoir simultanément une bague et une montre [dans son catalogue] », croit savoir le patron d’Oura, qui essaie peut-être juste de se convaincre que l’une des entreprises les plus riches du monde ne viendra pas empiéter sur son territoire. Oura vient justement de lancer son nouveau modèle, [la Ring 4](https://leclaireur.fnac.com/article/510004-la-prochaine-oura-ring-pourrait-revolutionner-le-paiement-sans-contact/), qui offre un suivi optimal des métriques de santé et de sommeil. Un marché prometteur, mais de niche Le journaliste de Bloomberg Mark Gurman, fidèle commentateur de l’actualité d’Apple, expliquait il y a peu qu’Apple avait effectivement étudié la possibilité d’explorer le marché des bagues connectées. En revanche, il n’existerait à l’heure actuelle aucune équipe consacrée à la recherche et développement sur ce type de produit. En d’autres termes : ce n’est pas du tout d’actualité. Samsung, lui, n’est pas dérangé par la potentielle cannibalisation de ses Galaxy Watch par sa bague connectée. Un premier modèle qui, d’ailleurs, rencontrerait un franc succès. Il faut dire que, si Oura est leader du secteur depuis 2015, la marque est encore assez mal distribuée, surtout en Europe. Samsung a donc un véritable coup à jouer – d’autant plus que la marque fait figure d’autorité. Il est en effet rassurant de se diriger vers un constructeur que l’on connaît bien pour adopter un nouveau type d’appareil électronique. Mais seul l’avenir nous dira si le marché des bagues connectées est viable ou s’il ne s’agit que d’une petite bulle éphémère. D’après [Global Market Insights](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/smart-rings-market), ce segment ne pesait que 210 millions de dollars en 2023, mais pourrait atteindre le milliard de dollars d’ici à 2032.",

    "title": "MARKET REPORT: BAE Systems fired up by ongoing global conflicts",
    "text": "British defence giant BAE Systems was one of the biggest FTSE 100 risers yesterday as the industry was boosted by geopolitical tensions. On a quiet day for the London market, BAE’s share price rose 0.6 per cent, or 6.5p, to 1,102p after a report revealed its order book had jumped around £7billion in a year. Heightened global hostilities and ongoing conflicts have increased defence spending. The order books of the world’s biggest defence companies have been pushed to near record highs and the MSCI’s global benchmark for the industry’s stocks is up 25 per cent over the past 12 months. The war in Ukraine partly explains the increase but firms such as BAE Systems have also been buoyed by new orders for existing contracts. Boosted: On a quiet day for the London market, BAE’s share price rose 1.1% after a report revealed its order book had jumped around £7bn in a year The report revealed that BAE’s order backlog rose from £48.5billion to £55.5billion in 2022. And orders hit a record £66billion in the first half of this year. Meanwhile mining stocks also rose after copper prices jumped 1.36 per cent to 8,690.5p yesterday. Anglo American’s share price rose 0.5 per cent, or 9p, to 1,984.8p while Antofagasta was down 0.2 per cent, or 3p, at 1,707.5p. Glencore’s share price fell 0.4 per cent, or 1.7p, to 470.1p. Rio Tinto’s stock surged 0.6 per cent, or 35p, to 5,860p. Other risers included AstraZeneca, which continued to gain off the back of a £950million deal to buy Shanghai pharmaceutical company Gracell Biotechnology, which was announced on Boxing Day. The drugmaker’s share price jumped 0.4 per cent, or 46p, to 10,574p, with rival pharma giant GSK also up 0.8 per cent, or 11.6p, to 1,461.2p. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks was down 0.03 per cent, or 2.2 points, at 7,722.74p, while the midcap FTSE 250 index fell 0.01 per cent, or 1.6 points, to 19,719.16. Zanaga Iron Ore shares climbed after the company unveiled a deal to power its Republic of Congo project. The agreement has been signed with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). CMEC will complete inspections on the sites near Zanaga and draft proposals on how the hydro dams will be financed. Iron ore prices have been gathering steam in the past weeks as confidence over the outlook for China’s steel demand increases. Shares jumped 17.3 per cent, or 1.5p to 10.3p. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rose 0.2 per cent, while the S&P 500 also ticked up 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the pound was trading at $1.276 against the dollar. Oil prices dropped around 1 per cent after sliding almost 2 per cent the previous day as major shipping firms began returning to the Red Sea. Danish company Maersk said it has scheduled container vessels to travel via the Suez Canal and Red Sea. It had called a temporary halt this month following attacks by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia. The move to reinstate the route has ‘helped dispel some immediate concerns about supply issues’, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. Shell’s share price dipped 0.3 per cent, or 7p, to 2,549p. BP’s stock dropped 0.4 per cent, or 2p, to 465p on lower oil prices. ‘The market is likely to try the upside again... maybe in the early new year, on expectations of a recovery in fuel demand thanks to monetary easing in the United States,’ said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. UK housebuilder stocks fell on fears the Bank of England will be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. A cautious approach would keep mortgage costs higher for longer. Barratt Developments’ share price fell 0.7 per cent, or 4p, to 562.4p, Land Securities’ stock dropped 1 per cent, or 7.2p, to 716.4p and Berkeley tumbled 0.4 per cent, or 20p, to 4,737p. Streeter said: ‘Housebuilders are on the back foot amid signs that consumers are still showing signs of resilience in their spending patterns in the post-Christmas sales. ‘The Bank of England is showing more wariness than the Fed about the trajectory for inflation, so any sign that interest rates might stay higher for longer in the UK aren’t read well for the housing market.’ On London’s AIM market, the biggest faller was chipmaker Sondrel. Shares plunged 53.7 per cent after a £1.7million contract delay sparked cashflow issues.",

    "text": "天风证券股份有限公司杨松,曹文清,张中华近期对泽璟制药进行研究并发布了研究报告《兼具销售放量和研发成果兑现的优秀创新药企》，给予泽璟制药买入评级。\n　　泽璟制药(688266)\n　　已实现三个重点品种商业化，重组人促甲状腺激素有望于近期上市截至2025年5月，公司已成功实现3款重点药物上市销售，分别是甲苯磺酸多纳非尼片、重组人凝血酶、盐酸吉卡昔替尼片，另有注射用重组人促甲状腺激素处于申请上市阶段，有望于近期上市销售。\n　　ZG006：全球首个CD3/DLL3/DLL3三抗，潜在BIC分子\n　　目前靶向CD3/DLL3的双抗和多抗药物较少，且适应症集中在小细胞肺癌、前列腺神经内分泌肿瘤等实体瘤。其中，进展最快的为安进公司的塔拉妥单抗，已获批上市。泽璟制药ZG006目前处于2期临床阶段，全球研发进度靠前，我们认为其或有望成为全球第一个进入临床3期的CD3/DLL3三抗产品。\n　　ZG006在2025年ASCO会议上公布的最新进展数据显示，ZG006单药10mg Q2W和30mg Q2W剂量在三线及以上小细胞肺癌患者中均展现出显著的抗肿瘤活性及良好的安全性。\n　　ZG005：宫颈癌临床试验数据亮眼，积极拓展多项适应症\n　　全球处于活跃研发的PD-1/TIGIT双抗管线较少，总体具有稀缺性。阿斯利康的PD-1/TIGIT双抗药物Rilvegostomig进展最快，在中国内地与美国均处于3期临床阶段。泽璟的PD-1/TIGIT双抗药物ZG005临床进度居于全球前列，在中国内地已推进至临床2期。\n　　ZG005在宫颈癌中展现出优异的疗效。截至2024年12月5日，ZG005-001项目I期剂量递增阶段已完成；II期剂量扩展阶段中，共55例二线及以上宫颈癌患者接受（ZG005）治疗，既往未接受过免疫检查点抑制剂治疗的二线及以上宫颈癌患者中，20mg/kg组（N=22）基于IRC评估的确认ORR为40.9%，DCR为68.2%。基于研究者评估，20mg/kg组mPFS已超过11个月。\n　　盈利预测和投资评级\n　　我们预计公司2025至2027年营业收入为8.20亿、12.01亿、16.03亿元人民币，实现归母净利润-0.20亿、1.21亿、2.82亿元人民币，维持“买入”评级。\n　　风险提示：尚未盈利的风险，业绩大幅下滑或亏损的风险，核心竞争力风险，经营风险。\n证券之星数据中心根据近三年发布的研报数据计算，华源证券刘闯研究员团队对该股研究较为深入，近三年预测准确度均值为62.12%，其预测2025年度归属净利润为亏损1100万。\n最新盈利预测明细如下：\n该股最近90天内共有8家机构给出评级，买入评级8家；过去90天内机构目标均价为77.18。\n以上内容为证券之星据公开信息整理，由AI算法生成（网信算备310104345710301240019号），不构成投资建议。",
