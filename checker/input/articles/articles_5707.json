    "title": "Chase Ink Business Unlimited credit card review - The Points Guy",
    "text": "The Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card is one of the best business cards with no annual fee because it earns 1.5% back on every purchase. This card also has a $900 bonus cash back after you spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening although this offer is ending soon — apply today to take advantage of it. Card Rating*: ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n*Card Rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer. The Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card is a small-business card that closely mirrors the popular Chase Freedom Unlimited, but with a much higher introductory bonus (that's ending soon). There is no annual fee, and its simple reward structure is more valuable than it looks at first glance.\nAlthough other cards earn 1.5% cash back (or more), with the Ink Business Unlimited card, you can earn cash back in the form of Chase Ultimate Rewards points . Those Chase points can become significantly more valuable if you also have a premium Ultimate Rewards card. That's because you can combine Chase points from your accounts and then transfer them to the Ultimate Rewards program's various airline and hotel partners.\nThe Ink Business Unlimited is a business credit card and is thus tailored to those with small businesses. While not everyone is eligible for a business credit card , it may be easier to be approved than you think — provided you have a \"good to excellent\" credit score of 670 or above — because freelancing and other sole-proprietor enterprises can count as a business in the eyes of Chase and many other issuers.\nInk Business Unlimited welcome offer Currently, the welcome offer on the Ink Business Unlimited is $900 cash back after you spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. This matches the best-ever offer we saw on the card from October 2022 to March 2023 — but you should act soon as this limited-time offer is coming to a close soon.\nThe $900 cash back is earned in the form of uber-flexible Chase Ultimate Rewards points (90,000 points), which you can redeem at a rate of 1 cent each as cash back, gift cards or travel booked through the Chase Travel portal.\nTHE POINTS GUY However, you can more than double your return (potentially) if you pair the Ink Business Unlimited with a card that earns transferable Ultimate Rewards points, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card . According to TPG valuations , 90,000 Ultimate Rewards points are worth $1,845. That's a solid haul on a card that charges no annual fee.\nInk Business Unlimited benefits You get what you pay for when it comes to benefits, so it's no surprise that the Ink Business Unlimited doesn't offer as many perks as other cards with higher annual fees. Its benefits are identical to those offered by the Ink Business Cash Credit Card but they're not quite as good as the perks offered on the Ink Business Preferred Credit Card . Most notably, you will not get cellphone protection or trip cancellation/interruption insurance.\nHere's a quick rundown of what's included:\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time. Purchase protection: This covers new purchases for up to 120 days against damage or theft, up to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per account. Auto rental collision damage waiver: When you rent a car for business purposes using Ink Business Unlimited, you can decline the rental car company's collision insurance and be covered by the card up to the vehicle's cash value in the case of theft or collision damage. This is valid on most rentals in the U.S. and abroad, and coverage is primary , which means it applies before your own car insurance policy. Extended warranty: This extends the time period of a U.S. manufacturer's warranty by an additional year on eligible warranties of three years or less. Employee cards at no additional cost: If employees are allowed to use the account, they will be authorized users and will have equal charging privileges, unless you establish individual spending limits. Earning rewards on the Ink Business Unlimited The Ink Business Unlimited earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases using a straightforward rewards structure that requires no thinking about rotating or bonus categories. This represents both the beauty of this card and its potential downside.\nFor example, if you buy airfare with this card, you could be forgoing rewards of up to 5 points per dollar that a card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers (when booked through the Chase Travel Portal ).\nThe same goes for paying for office supplies or internet service. The Ink Business Cash earns 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable, cellphone and landline services each account anniversary year (1% thereafter). It also earns 2% back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants each account year.\nBe careful about evaluating this card only on its cash-back value. The unlimited cash-back offered by this card won't give you the highest return among cash-back business credit cards — if you redeem for cash, anyway.\nRedeeming rewards on the Ink Business Unlimited There are a few key ways to redeem your rewards: cash back, gift cards, travel or goods and services offered through Chase's rewards program.\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY If you redeem for cash, you can receive your money as a statement credit or through an electronic deposit into an eligible U.S. checking or savings account. Points redeemed for cash, gift cards or travel are worth 1 cent apiece.\nTransferring rewards on the Ink Business Unlimited You can boost your redemption rate to an effective return of 3% (based on TPG's valuations) on all spending if you move your points to a full-fledged Ultimate Rewards personal or business card, such as:\nInk Business Preferred Credit Card Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Chase Sapphire Reserve The other card must be registered to you, the owner of the company or a member of your household to qualify for a transfer.\nThe Ink Business Unlimited can represent an incredible value proposition when partnered with any of these other cards. Once you move points to an account that earns Ultimate Rewards, you can transfer them to valuable airline and hotel partners , or book travel directly through the Chase portal and receive a flat value for your points (1.5 cents per point with the Chase Sapphire Reserve; or 1.25 cents per point with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Ink Business Preferred).\nYou could get well over 2 cents per point in value, depending on which transfer partner you choose. For example, you could transfer 97,000 points to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer to book a one-way, first-class flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Frankfurt Airport (FRA) that regularly costs $5,000 or more, getting you nearly six cents per point.\nRelated: The power of the Chase Trifecta: Sapphire Reserve, Ink Preferred and Freedom Unlimited\nWhat cards compete with the Ink Business Unlimited? The Ink Business Unlimited's competitors are cards that offer a similar return on all spending. Business credit cards that offer fixed-rate rewards include:\nCapital One Spark Miles for Business : Earn 2 miles per dollar on all purchases. Earn a sign-up bonus of 50,000 bonus miles after spending $4,500 on purchases in the first three months of account opening. The introductory annual fee is $0, then $95 after (see rates and fees ). For more information, read our review of the Capital One Spark Miles for Business . Capital One Spark Cash Select for Excellent Credit : Earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Earn a sign-up bonus of $750 once you spend $6,000 on purchases within three months from account opening. This card has no annual fee (see rates and fees ). For more information, read our review of the Capital One Spark Cash Select for Excellent Credit . The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express : Earn 2 points per dollar on all eligible business purchases up to $50,000 per calendar year (1 point per dollar thereafter). This card has no annual fee (see rates and fees ). For more information, read our review of The Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express . Read more: The best business credit cards\nIs the Ink Business Unlimited worth it? The Ink Business Unlimited is a valuable option for everyday spending if you pair it with the right card. The Ink Business Cash Credit Card and Ink Business Preferred Credit Card don't offer a solid return on everyday, non-bonus spending, so this card fills that gap.\nYou can really maximize your business credit card rewards by pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with a premium Chase card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve . Watch out for the restrictions of the Chase 5/24 rule , though.\nBottom line One advantage to opening Chase business credit cards is that they won't add to your Chase 5/24 count once they're open, even though applying for them in the first place is subject to the rule.\nSo, if you qualify for business credit cards, it's a smart strategy to apply for a Chase business card, like the Ink Business Unlimited , before you apply for personal credit cards from Chase or other banks, which will count toward that 5/24 limit. And this card offers a great return on everyday spending that can be supercharged if you have another card earning Chase Ultimate Rewards points.",

Basée sur des indices sociaux et scolaires des collèges, elle condamne les écoles élémentaires rattachées aux établissements hors REP à rester invisibles et démunies. Privées de moyens supplémentaires et de dédoublements, ces écoles payent le prix fort d’un système figé, un constat accablant souligné par la Cour des comptes.\nLa directrice de l’école élémentaire du Pigeonnier à Digne-les-Bains, Sabrina Castelarnaud, décrit une réalité préoccupante. Avec un indice de position sociale (IPS) de 76,5 (2024-2025), le plus faible du département, l’école est pourtant non classé REP. \"Mes élèves sont issus de milieux défavorisés, rencontrent les mêmes difficultés d’apprentissage et de décalage culturel mais sans les moyens d’une REP\", déplore-t-elle.\nIl vous reste 67% à lire.",

    "text": "A 40-person team from Alabama was deployed Thursday to help with search and rescue efforts in Texas following the devastating flooding.\nAccording to Gov. Kay Ivey, the team includes members of Alabama Task Force 1 out of Mobile, Tuscaloosa Fire, and Saraland Fire. Ivey says this multi-disciplined team is capable of conducting search and rescue response efforts for all hazards, including locating, accessing, medically stabilizing and extricating survivors from impacted structures and areas. Specialized operational personnel include rescue, canine search, medical, hazmat, technical search, and communications.\n“Search and rescue remains the goal, and Alabama is going to do all we can to lend a helping hand to Texas,” said Ivey. “We are heartbroken in Alabama to have lost two of our own. I pray for Sarah Marsh’s family as they navigate the unimaginable loss of their precious daughter. My prayers are also with the Santanas as they grieve the loss of Camille and are still searching for three members of their family. Truly, we are all grieving alongside these Alabamians, as well as those in Texas and across our country.”\nThe governor says she aligned state resources after hearing of the devastation so the state could quickly act upon Texas’ call.\n“I am grateful to all those who are part of the search and rescue mission, and I pray for their safety and for the success of their mission,\" the governor continued. \"Y’all, pray for Texas!”\nThe team, which operates in 12-hour periods for up to 14 days, deployed at 3 p.m.",

    "text": "French Fête\nAustin watch party cheers on San Antonio Spurs in Paris game\nThe San Antonio Spurs are taking on the Indiana Pacers on Saturday, January 25 — but the game is taking place at the Accor Arena in Paris, France. For fans who can't commit to an international plane ticket, there are two official Texas watch parties. An Austin party creates a gathering place for fans ages 21 and up, while the San Antonio party is open to all ages.\nThe Spurs are actually playing the Pacers twice at the NBA Paris Games 2025, presented by Tissot, as part of their regular seasons. The first game is Thursday, January 23, but the watch parties are specifically for the Saturday game — that's considered the Spurs' \"home\" game.\nThere's also a special NBA Paris Jam on the day between, January 24. Celebrities, influencers, and \"NBA Legends\" will compete in a unique \"interactive basketball game\" that lets fans influence how the game plays out. Anyone can tune in by making an account at france.nba.com.\nOn Saturday, Austin-area fans can gather at Armadillo Den (10106 Menchaca Rd.) to watch together with tunes by DJ DMoney and Paris-themed photo ops; the party starts at 10:30 am for a game tipoff at 11 am.\nIf fans can't go to France, they might as well bring France to them, so free coffee, macarons, French pastries, and desserts will be on hand. Fans in Spurs gear will get a free drink ticket while supplies last. The event is only open to fans 21 and up, but dogs are invited, too. Free parking will be available in the lot.\nYounger fans might want to travel to the San Antonio party at The Rock at La Cantera (1 Spurs Way), starting at 9:30 am. Unlike the Austin event, this one will have a host: TV and radio personality Zay Zay. French pastries and mimosas will be available for purchase, and the first 100 fans of drinking age in Spurs gear will get a free drink ticket.\nTo watch the game even if you're not going to make the party, tune in on KENS or via the Spurs App presented by Frost.\nAccording to a press release, \"By taking part in the Paris Games, the Spurs aim to build meaningful relationships, highlight their culture and invest in initiatives that deliver long-term benefits to the community. This effort reflects the team’s focus on fostering connections and showcasing the unifying power of sports.\"",

    "text": "MADRID, 13 Sep. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl sindicato de los trabajadores de Boeing en en la región de Seattle (EE.UU.) ha convocado una huelga por primera vez en 16 años y ha rechazado la oferta del fabricante para subir un 25% los salarios.\nSegún recoge DPA, el 94,65% de los trabajadores votaron que no a la oferta que lanzó Boeing para evitar los paros, que contemplaba una subida salarial del 25% en cuatro años, mejorar en las coberturas sanitarias y las jubilaciones, dado que el sindicato IAM había pedido inicialmente un incremento del 40% en los salarios. Además, el 96% apoyó la convocatoria de huelga.\nLa huelga ha comenzado a las 00.00 hora local de este viernes para unos 30.000 trabajadores. Los representantes sindicales han señalado en una rueda de prensa recogida por 'Bloomberg' que los puntos del acuerdo no eran lo suficientemente buenos y que la oferta no compensaba los 16 años de estancamiento salarial, el aumento de los gastos sanitarios y la deslocalización de miles de empleos sindicales.\nPor su parte, Boeing ha emitido un comunicado en el que muestra su compromiso para restablecer la relación con los trabajadores y el sindicato, además de volver a la mesa para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo.\nBoeing atraviesa una crisis de reputación, de seguridad y económica desde 2019, cuando dos aviones 737 MAX sufrieron accidentes fatales. Tras esto, se han producido otros incidentes, como la caída de una parte del fuselaje de un avión de Alaska Airlines a principios de este año.\nLeer más acerca de: Estados Unidos Huelga sindicatos Boeing",

    "title": "Israel cancels accreditation of Norwegian diplomats to Palestinian areas",
    "text": "Israel on Thursday revoked the accreditation of eight Norwegian diplomats working as representatives to the Palestinian Authority, drawing a sharp response from Norway’s foreign minister who called it “an extreme act”. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision to revoke the diplomats’ status was made in response to what he described as Norway’s anti-Israeli conduct, including its recognition of a Palestinian state. “Norway conducts a one-sided policy on the Palestinian issue, and will therefore be removed from the Palestinian issue,” Katz said in a statement. Norway blames the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the diplomatic spat and is now considering its response to the situation, Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide said in a statement. “This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population … Today’s decision will have consequences for our relationship with the Netanyahu government,” he said. The decision was also condemned by the Palestinian Authority, as a “violation and breach of international laws”. “The decision of the Israeli foreign ministry regarding the Norwegian mission in Palestine has dangerous dimensions and carries major repercussions,” Hussein Al-Sheikh, general secretary of President Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Liberation Organization said in a statement on the social media platform X. Even though Norway is not part of the European Union, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also spoke against Israel’s decision. “I strongly condemn the decision by the Israeli Government to revoke the diplomatic status for Norwegian diplomats dealing with the Palestinian Authority. This is of interest for all working for peace and stability in the Middle East. Full solidarity to Norway,” he said in a statement. Norway in the 1990s helped negotiate the Oslo Accords, a set of agreements designed to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians. While peace has remained elusive, the Nordic country still chairs the international donor group to the Palestinians. Norway had long argued that a two-state solution could only be achieved through dialogue, and not through a unilateral approach, but eventually lost confidence in this strategy. Along with Spain and Ireland, Norway in May officially recognised a Palestinian state, in the hope this would help accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli government repeatedly condemned the decision, saying it bolstered the militant Islamist group that led the deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war in the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip.",

    "text": "I've been going on cruises for over 10 years, so I have some tips for first-time cruisers . Book directly through a cruise line and reconsider drink packages to save money. I've been on dozens of cruises in the past 10 years, and I've learned a lot about the best ways to sail .\nHere are my best tips for someone booking their first cruise .\nTake the time to choose the right cruise line and ship for you Not all cruise lines are the same. Some, like Disney Cruise Line , showcase beloved characters and have mostly family-friendly activities.\nOthers, like Norwegian Cruise Line , target cruisers looking for a more upscale and modern cruise ship with plenty to do for adults and older teens.\nTo find the right cruise line, consider what you want to do on the ship and the types of travelers you want to sail with.\nThen, narrow down to the right ship by looking at what each offers. Also, consider your budget and what type of stateroom you'll want to book .\nBook your cruise by calling the cruise line directly to get the best deal In my experience, the best way to get deals is to call the cruise line directly to book your sailing.\nAlthough you may have seen some deals on the cruise line's website, people working in the booking center can see every deal you're eligible for at once.\nBecause of that, they can see which offer will save you the most money.\nFor example, on a recent sailing with Carnival, I saw discounts on standard balcony rooms online. When I called, an employee told me I was also eligible for a discount through the casino because of my spending on a previous sailing.\nI'd had no idea, and the latter was the better deal for me and my family.\nJoin a Facebook group for your cruise After you book your cruise, try to find the appropriate Facebook group for your sailing.\nYou can do that by using the search bar and typing in the ship's name and the dates of your sailing, like \\\"Norwegian Prima, December 2-5, 2022.\\\"\nIf you can't find one, consider starting one yourself.\nThe groups are a fun way to meet other people who are going to be on your sailing. They're also a great place to ask questions about the trip.\nI've learned a lot from lurking in these groups.\nTry to explore the ship online before you leave your house All major cruise lines have ship models online that guests can virtually explore before getting to the terminal.\nThis is a great tool to use to learn where your stateroom is, what's around it, and which activities are on the ship.\nUsually, you can explore the ship floor-by-floor, and if you click on a restaurant, lounge, or something else, a small description of the space will pop up so you can learn more about it.\nBook the port excursions you want to do ahead of time Booking a port excursion before getting on the ship is the best way to secure your spot on tours and fun activities.\nMany people will book excursions on the ship, and the lines at the port desk can get very long, especially as more people arrive.\nYou may also want to consider booking excursions with reliable third-party vendors that have good reviews online and don't take you too far from the pier.\nAll-inclusive beach days are a great option to book with third-party groups because most beaches are just a short walk or taxi ride away from the ship.\nThe downside to booking excursions that are not through the cruise line is that if you are late getting back, the ship will not wait for you, and you could be left in an unfamiliar port city.\nThe best bet to not get left behind is to leave the excursion or beach at least an hour and a half before the ship's departure time.\nTry to get to the departure city at least a day early One of the biggest stress-relieving tips for cruising is getting to your cruise's departure city at least a day early.\nThis will help you board the ship on time and relieve some travel stress regarding delayed flights on the day your ship sets sail.\nArriving a day early will add to your overall vacation cost, so be sure to budget for an extra night at a hotel and food for the extra day.\nAlways pack a carry-on bag for the first day of the cruise When boarding a cruise ship, you don't carry your larger suitcases with you.\nOn embarkation day, staterooms typically aren't ready until later in the afternoon, and luggage can arrive well after dinner.\nBecause of this, I recommend bringing a carry-on bag for the first day of your cruise.\nI usually suggest bringing a swimsuit so you can enjoy the pool, plus any charging cords, medications, and sunscreen you may need.\nReally, really consider if drink packages are worth it Most cruise lines offer drink packages that can draw you in with the idea that you pay a flat fee once and get over a dozen alcoholic beverages in one day.\nBut I suggest crunching some numbers to decide if the packages will be worth it for you. For many packages, you need to drink seven or eight cocktails a day to break even.\nOn most cruise lines, everyone in your stateroom has to order the drink package to deter people from sharing drinks with others.\nDrink packages are priced per day and must be bought for the entirety of a cruise. So, on a seven-night cruise, you must buy a seven-night drink package.\nBut you can also check if the drink package includes specialty coffee or milkshakes, which can help offset the cost.",

    "text": "God is dead, according to Klaus Schwab’s right-hand man Yuval Noah Harari, who also claimed that “Jesus is fake news” and the World Economic Forum has acquired “divine powers” of “creation and destruction” to rule over humanity. The WEF is also increasingly hostile to Christianity and major religions. If you read between the lines just a little, it’s clear the WEF is consciously attempting to supplant Jesus Christ. BYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox. You can unsubscribe any time. By subscribing you agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/website-terms-of-use/) According to the WEF, Jesus is fake news, God is dead, and you do not have a soul. You are a “hackable animal” who does not have the capacity for free will. Harari, the world’s most influential transhumanist, has also laid out a plan to replace human workers through automation and artificial intelligence. The technological revolution, he declared, will create a large number of “ [useless people](https://ideas.ted.com/the-rise-of-the-useless-class/).” The concept of “useless people” brings to mind the Nazi concept of “Worthless Eaters” — whom the Nazis medically murdered. According to Yuval, the most pressing question currently faced by the global elite is [“What do we need so many humans for?”](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/wef-orders-govts-to-arrest-whistleblowers-who-expose-depopulation-agenda/) Yuval Harari’s message is frightening: are most human beings now considered disposable? And will the transhuman replacement for human beings be a cyborg (man melded with machine) [with no imagination, no empathy, no soul and no God?](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/klaus-schwab-god-is-dead-and-the-wef-is-acquiring-divine-powers/) Per [Vera Sharav:](https://doortofreedom.org/2023/07/14/transhumanism/) This threatens the moral foundation of a humane society – which is built upon the belief in the sanctity of the individual, our autonomy, freedom and equal rights. The word transhumanism relates to the integration of human bodies with technology. It is driven by scientific advances but directed and financed by governments, military agencies, medical institutions, Big Pharma, and multi-national corporations. Transhumanism discards medical ethics while ‘Playing God’ with humanity. Transhumanism and the related Technocracy (the control of society by technical experts) are the drivers of today’s eugenics (a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics) quality of a [human population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_population)). In the past, these ideas labeled large groups of human beings as “deplorables.” It is perhaps no coincidence that the Human Genome Project is housed at Cold Spring Harbor, NY — the historic center of eugenics in the US. Transhumanists seek to cast aside the biblical idea that each human being is created in God’s image and possessed of [natural rights](https://constitutionus.com/constitution/rights/what-are-natural-rights/) to which we are each entitled, solely because we are human. [TRENDING: Putin Exposes the Truth About the “Fake” Moon Landings](https://rumble.com/v41zffv-putin-exposes-the-truth-about-the-fake-moon-landings.html) Transhumanists are obsessed with liberating us from our biological limitations. They predict that the merger of humans and technology will vastly increase our physical strength, our intelligence, and our life span. However, accelerated developments in genetics, including genetic RNA and DNA vaccines, raise the possibility of genetically altering the human race. This could produce a two-class society – a master caste and an underclass, as described in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Transhumanists seek to vastly improve the master caste. But what about the rest? It may be no coincidence that Aldous Huxley’s brother Julian was the president of the British Eugenics Society, the first Director of [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO), and a founding member of the [World Wildlife Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund). The medical-scientific establishment has ignored the moral danger lurking behind the transhumanist agenda. Distinguished Stanford Professor Francis Fukuyama [declared](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563415/) that transhumanism is “the world’s most dangerous idea” because transhumanism is both authoritarian and anti-human.
