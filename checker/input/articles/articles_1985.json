    "title": "Park City Mountain Bike Patrol and Trail Crew file to unionize, seek pay equity with winter roles - NewsBreak",
    "text": "PARK CITY, Utah — Summer employees at Park City Mountain are seeking to form a union, joining a growing wave of labor organization efforts in the outdoor recreation industry. A petition was filed last week by the resort’s bike patrol and winter maintenance trail crew—many of whom also work as ski patrollers in the winter—aiming to establish their own union separate from their cold-season counterparts. The move follows a high-profile contract battle and strike by the Park City Professional Ski Patrol Association (PCPSPA) this past winter, which resulted in a new agreement with Vail Resorts. Like the winter ski patrol, the summer groups are seeking representation by the Communications Workers of America. Joe Kim, a business manager for PCPSPA and a member of the resort’s trail crew, said the group is hoping to gain voluntary recognition from the resort, which would allow them to skip a formal vote and begin contract negotiations. That request was submitted on August 1. As of Tuesday afternoon, however, they had not received a response from Park City Mountain. Kim said the group is optimistic the National Labor Relations Board will issue a determination by the end of the week. According to Kim, the core of the group’s argument is wage alignment. “We have a livable wage in the winter after the successful negotiations last season,” he said. “And we are using similar skill sets. So we are looking for a wage that is more in line with the skill sets we are employing every day.” In some cases, Kim noted, summer employees are now earning less than they did prior to the new winter contract, even while performing highly technical and physically demanding work. Trail crew members are responsible for a range of duties critical to the resort’s infrastructure—rerouting and reclaiming overgrown trails, maintaining terrain for safety, and preparing ski runs for winter. Last year, a crew of 18 helped cut the lift line for the new gondola at Park City Mountain, felling old-growth trees in what Kim described as “a large-scale project” that directly impacts Park City’s ability to install a new key piece of infrastructure. While bike haul operations run only about three months each summer, employees are required to hold medical certifications and participate in lift evacuation drills. Summer patrollers, meanwhile, respond to injuries and incidents for all of Park City Mountain Resorts summer operations, from mountain biking accidents, to injuries at the alpine slide and other activities, to attending to other mountain employees who need assistance or get hurt. In response to the petition, a spokesperson for Park City Mountain confirmed the resort is aware of the union effort and will engage with the process. “We believe a direct connection to our employees fosters the strongest working relationship between our employees and their resort leaders,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “But we respect their right to file this petition and are engaging in this process.” The resort also clarified that while it is proud to offer summer roles to ski patrollers, the summer operation is less complex than the winter season. Employees who perform lift evacuations are already paid additional compensation for those duties, the spokesperson said. Park City Mountain emphasized that its summer bike haul and trail maintenance operations are not part of a full-scale bike park business and are not currently profitable. Still, the resort said it is glad to provide those services for the Park City community and visitors. Whether the union will move forward now hinges on the resort’s response to the request for voluntary recognition—or a potential vote overseen by the labor board.",

    "title": "A real strength for ASSE?",
    "text": "The Arkema Première Ligue championship will return this weekend. On its first day, ASSE will travel to [Reims](/tag/Reims) like last year. In an interview for Le Progrès, Sarah Cambot talks about her arrival in Forez. Sarah Cambot, an important recruit for ASSE On June 21, 31-year-old midfielder Sarah Cambot became the fourth signing of the Saint-Etienne transfer window. She arrived from another first division club, Guingamp. Moreover, when she arrived in Forez, she was pleasantly surprised. “I was received by the coach, the president, there was the communications department. We also had a medical examination. This may seem logical for boys, but it is not necessarily so in women’s football. Straight away, I entered into something very professional and that is what I came here for.” For decades, ASSE has been one of the most popular clubs in [France](/tag/France). Since she was little, Sarah Cambot has been used to hearing about this legendary club. “It’s a legendary club that makes you want to discover it: the infrastructure, the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium… Since I’ve been here, I’ve been almost a child. There are things that I look at with big eyes.” A goal-scoring midfielder? One of Sarah’s strengths is her consistency. For several seasons, the ASSE player has been playing in one match after another and scoring goals. In fact, in 4 years she has scored a total of 21 goals - 2023/2024: 22 matches, 4 goals - 2022/2023: 22 matches, 7 goals - 2021/2022: 22 matches, 5 goals - 2020/2021: 20 matches, 5 goals Laurent Mortel has also challenged him to score six goals this year. “Six goals, I’ve already done it, so it’s achievable. Ten, never, but it can be a challenge to see if the coach is right or not. If I can do it, I won’t deprive myself of it. As I grow and change positions, if I get to five goals and as many assists, that will suit me very well too. Scoring gives me just as much pleasure as helping my teammates score.” It must be said that Sarah also has experience as a striker before being repositioned in midfield. “By changing positions, I had to find automatisms again. I had to think differently. […] “. Answer this weekend?",

    "text": "Un gol marcó Luis Díaz en la Copa América con la selección Colombia Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports En su última publicación, el Liverpool Echo sugirió que la escuadra de Merseyside debería considerar la venta del colombiano Luis Díaz, argumentando que, a pesar de una buena temporada pasada, no ha mostrado todo su potencial.\n“ Dos años y medio después de su impactante llegada, la carrera de Luis Díaz en el Liverpool aún no ha despegado . Tras llegar como el sucesor de Sadio Mané en la banda izquierda, solo ha dejado más preguntas que respuestas desde entonces”, indicó el medio británico.\nAhora puede seguirnos en nuestro WhatsApp Channel y en Facebook .\nLa prensa inglesa a favor de la venta de Luis Díaz El jugador del Liverpool disputó los seis partidos de la Copa América con la selección Colombia - crédito Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports Además, señalaron: “ Aunque sigue siendo un jugador habitual en el equipo, hay nuevos rumores sobre su futuro… Los Reds podrían recibir el doble de los 37 millones de libras que pagaron al Porto por Díaz dos años y medio atrás”.\nEl Liverpool Echo expuso que Díaz es uno de los jugadores más solicitados por otros clubes, mencionando el interés de PSG y Barcelona que, hasta ahora, no ha pasado de ser mera especulación.\n“ A principios de verano, el Barcelona estaba en la mira para hacerse con él, pero en su lugar su atención se ha centrado en Nico Williams. El Paris Saint-Germain también ha sido mencionado como posible interesado tras la salida de Kylian Mbappé de su delantera estelar , pero Desire Doue y Victor Osimhen están en sus primeros objetivos”, explicó el medio.\nPese a las críticas, todo indica que Luis Díaz será una pieza importante para el nuevo entrenador del Liverpool, Arne Slot. “El Liverpool no está muy interesado en vender a Díaz”, afirmó el Liverpool Echo, destacando que el técnico neerlandés lo considera un jugador clave en su esquema para la nueva temporada.\nLiverpool habría tomado decisión sobre Lucho Díaz 13 goles marcó Luis Díaz en la última temporada con el Liverpool - crédito Carl Recine/REUTERS Uno de los jugadores a seguir en la Copa América era Luis Díaz; sin embargo, el ex Junior de Barranquilla no tuvo el rendimiento esperando en el certamen orbital pese a disputar la final ante Argentina en Miami.\nEl nacido en Barracas (La Guajira) disputó lo seis encuentros de la competición que se realizó en Estados Unidos, marcando un tanto en la victoria de la Tricolor sobre Costa Rica en Glendale Arizona.\nDe acuerdo con la información de Caughtoffside, Arne Slot, ha confirmado oficialmente la decisión respecto al futuro de Luis Díaz. El equipo inglés ha decidido mantener al colombiano en su plantilla debido a su desempeño y proyección dentro del conjunto.\nDíaz está en los planes de Slot de cara a la próxima, ya que valora su habilidad, versatilidad y capacidad para influir tanto en la ofensiva como en la defensiva. En Liverpool consideran al colombiano un jugador fundamental para afrontar los desafíos de la próxima temporada en la Premier League y en las competiciones internacionales.\nEl equipo confía en que su continuo desarrollo y aportes en el campo serán esenciales para alcanzar los objetivos establecidos. Según el portal Caughtoffside , “ El Liverpool ha comunicado claramente al agente de Luis Díaz que no planea vender al jugador en la ventana de transferencia de este verano, a pesar del interés del Barcelona, el Paris Saint-Germain y el club Al Ahli de la Saudi Pro League ”.\nDe momento el jugador se encuentra tomando unos días de descanso mientras se une a la pretemporada de su equipo.

    "title": "As migration increased in 2023, so did pressures on the church's ministry",
    "text": "Unauthorized border crossings increased in 2023, fueled in part by shifts in U.S. policy and global migration trends. The year saw increasingly heated anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions that also put Catholic Charities agencies -- and the church's religious freedom to minister to migrants -- in the crosshairs.\nIn fiscal year 2023 (Oct. 1, 2022-Sept. 30, 2023), U.S. Customs and Border Protection saw almost 2.48 million encounters at the nation's southwest land border, up from close to 2.38 million in the previous fiscal year. (As defined by the agency, encounter statistics represent the number of interactions between CBP and migrants, not the number of individuals.)\nJ. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told OSV News that \"with a record number of migrants arriving at the border, not to mention a record number of displaced globally, persons fleeing violence and poverty may face increasingly punitive immigration policies in 2024 and beyond.\"\n\"The voice of the Church in defending their rights will become even more crucial in the year ahead, especially in an election year in which anti-immigrant rhetoric will become more commonplace,\" Appleby said.\nU.S. policy on unauthorized migration saw significant changes over the course of 2023.\nTitle 42, a part of the federal health law used by the Trump administration to expel migrants, including those seeking asylum, during the COVID-19 pandemic, was officially ended by the Biden administration in May. But the administration quickly followed it with a policy sometimes referred to as an asylum ban. This policy denied asylum to migrants who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without first applying online or seeking asylum protections in a different country and faced legal scrutiny, with a judge blocking it in July.\nIn August, a federal appeals court allowed the ban to remain in effect, and the ban along with other more restrictive immigration measures is back on the table as Republican lawmakers seek tougher immigration policies in exchange for supporting the Biden administration's support for Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing war.\nConstruction on the controversial border wall, initiated under the Trump administration and long opposed by the U.S. Catholic bishops, received a renewed green light from the Biden administration in October, with the president saying that although he did not endorse the wall, the 2019 law passed by Congress upheld the project.\nAmong the state laws enacted this year, Texas adopted SB4, legislation that makes crossing into the state unlawfully a state crime separate from a federal one, and gives state judges the ability to issue de facto deportation orders. Several groups have filed legal challenges.\nTexas and several states also are spending large sums to bus migrants throughout the country, hoping to ease the strain on their local social support resources. However, the practice has drawn both legal challenges and humanitarian outrage, while incurring mounting costs.\nFlorida also enacted new, immigration-focused laws in July. A previous version of that bill directly challenged the church's religious liberty by threatening third-degree felony charges for those who transported or harbored migrants -- a broad net that Catholic and other Christian leaders were concerned would have ensnared the church's established ministries and charitable services to migrants, as well as its ordinary pastoral and sacramental care.\nThis year Catholic Charities USA, which represents a network of Catholic humanitarian organizations in the U.S., had to respond to what it called \"disturbing\" violent remarks by a social media influencer suggesting Catholic Charities' workers and volunteers should be shot for sheltering migrants.\nDisturbing anti-migrant rhetoric also has seeped into the U.S. presidential campaign. At a Dec. 17 campaign event in New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump, who is seeking the GOP's nomination to return to the White House and has made a hardline immigration stance part of his platform, said immigrants coming to the U.S. are \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" pointing to migrants from South America, Africa and Asia. He made a similar post on social media in which he said \"illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our nation.\"\nThe Biden administration immediately responded that Trump had \"parroted Adolf Hitler,\" referencing Nazi Germany leader's use of the term \"blood poisoning\" in his book \"Mein Kampf.\" On CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Trump GOP rival, Catholic and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Trump's words \"dog-whistling to blame it (Americans' stress and strain from the economy and global conflicts) on people from areas that don't look like us.\"\nMeanwhile, a June 2023 Gallup survey found that 41% of Americans said even legal immigration should be reduced, while 68% on the whole said immigration was a positive thing for the U.S.\nAppleby said \"a perfect storm of push factors\" have \"driven migration upward in 2023, including oppressive governments and failed states in our hemisphere.\"\n\"Climate change is another emerging push factor which has compounded the problem,\" he added. \"Until the U.S. and other nations effectively address these root causes, we may continue to see higher numbers at the Southern border. Punitive enforcement policies will not solve this challenge, as the push factors driving people are stronger over the long term.\"\nAmong those push factors are corrupt governments in migrants' countries of origin, gang violence and other types of transnational crime, which work to drive up migration to the U.S.\n\"In Central America, criminal gangs are very powerful and violent,\" Louise Shelley, professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government and director of its Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center, told OSV News. \"The homicide rates in Central America, much related to gang violence, are among the highest in the world. Individuals are threatened with extortion (and) kidnapping, and are tortured.\"\nGangs in Central America as well as Haiti are \"key drivers\" for migration from those countries, Shelley said, with \"more structured organized crime groups ... present in Colombia and (in) many other countries in Latin American and other regions of the world.\"\n\"In order to leave their sometimes dangerous and desperate situations, many immigrants hire smuggling groups -- often part or related to organized crime -- to protect them and move them to what they perceive will be a better place to live,\" she added. \"As the migrants often do not have the money to pay smugglers all they want, some of the migrants become victims of human trafficking.\"\nOthers who minister to migrants expressed frustration with how the U.S. handles those arriving at its borders.\nSister Rose Patrice Kuhn, an Immaculate Heart of Mary sister who currently ministers to migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border at McAllen, Texas with women religious from several congregations, told OSV News, \"It doesn't seem like there's a real policy to take care of the migrants.\n\"I'm not saying that immigration doesn't take care of them, but I don't know of any political figures that are trying to get bills passed that will make it clear what the policy is in the United States for migrants or asylum seekers,\" said Sister Rose, who works with Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley and with ministries in Reynosa, Mexico. \"It doesn't seem like anybody's really pushing to take care of the people ... so that they will know what's happening in their life.\"\nMany of those arriving at the border have experienced physical and sexual violence, as well as kidnapping for ransom, said Sister Rose, who sees anywhere from \"300 to 1,000 migrants\" per day at the humanitarian respite center operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley.\nSister Rose added that migrants crossing directly through the Rio Grande to enter the U.S. \"have nothing with them but the clothes on their back.\"\n\"They have nothing,\" she said. \"I mean, they come to us in Catholic Charities, and they don't have a comb; they don't have a brush; they don't have a toothbrush; they don't have shoes. Most of them have flip-flops at this point. Socks have been given to them here. When they cross the river, they have nothing -- positively nothing. And a lot of times they have no place to go and no relatives that are going to help them.\"\nAs 2023 drew to a close, lawmakers in Congress failed to conclude negotiations on an emergency spending bill to provide billions of dollars in wartime aid to Ukraine and Israel, with Republicans demanding strict new policies at the U.S.-Mexico border in exchange, drawing concern from Catholic bishops and migrant advocates as the White House searches for a deal in 2024.\n\"Recent policy proposals that would undermine respect for the sanctity of human life, including that of the humble migrant seeking asylum at our border, remind us of the perils of our own culture, in which hope and unity collide with an abundance of fear and division, often yielding indifference to our shared humanity,\" Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration, remarked in a Dec. 12 statement marking the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nBishop Seitz, at the very beginning of the year, had met with President Joe Biden during the latter's brief visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, urging him on behalf of the bishops to reverse course on the country's migration policies. He added, \"As Catholics, we affirm and defend an unconditional respect for human life and dignity, no matter the circumstance.\"",

    "title": "Big 12 opener: No. 10 Baylor holds off No. 5 Texas for 85-79 victory",
    "text": "AUSTIN — Jada Walker scored 19 points as No. 10 Baylor opened Big 12 Conference play Saturday with an 85-79 win over No. 5 Texas, which played its first game without injured point guard Rori Harmon.\nThe Bears (12-0) also got 18 points and eight rebounds from Dre’Una Edwards. Baylor has won 14 in a row at Texas (13-1) in a rivalry that won’t see as many matchups once the Longhorns leave for the Southeastern Conference after this season.\nWalker scored eight consecutive points in one stretch of the third quarter.\nTexas freshman Madison Booker had 25 points, eight assists and seven rebounds while taking over the point guard duties for Harmon, who was lost for the season when she tore a knee ligament in practice this week.\nBaylor built a 13-point lead with a burst to start the game, before Texas rallied and closed to 59-55 on Booker’s stretching finger-roll layup at the end of the third quarter.\nAmina Muhammad’s two free throws with 47 seconds left got Texas within four. But Muhammad fouled Baylor’s Sarah Andrews, who made two free throws with 20 seconds to play to stretch the Bears’ lead again.\nBooker then missed a long 3-pointer that rattled around the rim.\nMuhammad scored 17 points for Texas.\nThe Bears won 12 consecutive regular-season Big 12 championships from 2011-2022 and their hot start has them looking like the top title contender again. A win at Texas was a huge step in that direction.\nThe Longhorns got their first game without Harmon behind them. Now comes the grind of a long Big 12 season without Harmon’s energy and efficiency on both ends of the court. Harmon had 93 assists against just 14 turnovers and was a lock-down defender despite her 5-foot-6 height. Booker is bigger and stronger at 6-1 but now shoulders the burden of leading the team.",

    "text": "Tinubu pledges to end reign of terror in South-East – Shettima\nShettima said the terror groups that have held the southeast to ransom are not a creation of the people of the region or Nigerians from other parts of the country.\nShettima stated this at the unveiling of the Peace in South East Project (PISE-P) by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, in Bende Local Government Area (LGA) of Abia.\nHe condemned those he described as self-serving criminals and certain persons taking advantage of the security situation to foster their dangerous political agenda in the region.\nShettima said Tinubu had been worried about the economic devastation inflicted on the South East geopolitical zone by non-state actors since he assumed office.\nHe also assured that Tinubu was determined to deploy all available resources to eliminate the purveyors of falsehoods and propaganda that have become weapons against Nigeria’s unity.\nIn his speech, titled, “Why We are all Umunna”, Shettima said Tinubu is concerned about the extensive economic devastation inflicted by non-state actors on this beautiful region since we took office.\n“Tinubu is acutely aware that our commitment to Nigeria’s future remains incomplete as long as we grapple with the sinister operations of economic saboteurs who masquerade as advocates for the Ndi-Igbo.\n“That’s why he’s determined to utilise all available resources to ensure that the peace we’re establishing in this region is not cosmetic.\n“And we can’t guarantee it unless all of us see through the falsehoods and propaganda that have become weapons against our unity.”\nShettima noted that the gory activities of the criminals holding the Southeast captive are self-serving and do not in any way represent the interests of Ndi-Igbo and the entire country.\nHe said the terror groups that have held the southeast to ransom are not a creation of the people of the region or Nigerians from other parts of the country.\n“The problem we are here to solve as a community, as an Umunna, is a creation of self-serving criminals who do not represent the interests of the Ndi-Igbo and Nigerians.\n“Mr President knows this better than all of us, and that’s why he has never held any group accountable for the infractions of law-breaking individuals who identify as their members.\n” This, I believe, is the democracy we have all chosen,” he stated.\nHe pointed out that the criminals disrupting the peace in the southeast are doing so in connivance with “forces exploiting the situation for dangerous political agenda.”\nThe Vice President said attempts to undo the hard work of the nation’s heroes past would fail.\nHe, however, said that the catastrophic situation can’t be reversed unless the government involves the people whom he said are the ears, legs and mouths in the region.\n“Today, we stand united to firmly declare: enough is enough,” VP Shettima stated.\nHe stressed the need for a coordinated intervention to tackle insecurity in the region head-on.\nShettima assured the southeast people that the Tinubu administration “shall not rest until it fulfils its pledge to mitigate the crisis it inherited.”\nThe vice president noted that no better visionary could save the nation from implosion than President Tinubu.\nHe said the development agenda of the Federal Government in the southeast would continue to elude the region if the intricate web of security challenges the Tinubu-led federal government inherited is not contained.\n“The seeds of progress can only sprout in the fertile soil of peace and security.\n“This is why we take immense pride in the collaboration of all stakeholders and initiatives such as the Peace in South East project.\n“This will ensure that the shield of security in the region isn’t a distant mirage in the landscape of aspirations.”\nHe commended the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and convener of the peace initiative, Kalu, for his efforts to restore lasting peace in the region.\nHe said the event attests “to the profound understanding that no one comprehends the experience of a community better than the people themselves.”\nEarlier, Kalu said that his goal for initiating the Peace In South East Project (PISE-P) was to foster peace, unity, and development in the region.\nHe said the project also aims at promoting reconciliation among communities and individuals affected by past conflicts.\n“When I embarked on the South East Project, my vision was clear — to foster peace, unity, and development in our region through a non-kinetic approach.\n“The southeast has long been known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant communities, and enterprising people. Yet, we have faced our fair share of challenges, including socioeconomic disparities, insecurities, political tensions, and occasional conflicts.\n“Our goals in the southeast project are clear. We aim to promote reconciliation among communities and individuals affected by past conflicts.\n“We recognise the need to address the root causes of conflict, including socio-economic disparities and political tensions.\n“Empowering communities is another crucial goal of the project, providing them with the necessary resources, skills, and opportunities for sustainable development.”\nEyewitness?

    "text": "Hope, el raro cuervo blanco, fue rescatado provocando sorpresa y cuidado en la comunidad. (Joseph Capone) La abogada de derechos civiles Catherine Sevcenko dedica su tiempo libre a acoger y rehabilitar aves heridas en Alexandria, Virginia, Estados Unidos.\nMuchos de los cuervos volantones que aparecen en su puerta se han caído de nidos , han sido atropellados por coches o se han estrellado contra ventanas . Pero hay una constante en los últimos 12 años: todos están cubiertos de brillantes plumas negras , afilados picos negros y ojos oscuros .\nSevcenko apenas podía creerlo cuando apareció el mes pasado un cuervo poco común al que llamó Hope .\n“Nunca había visto un cuervo blanco ”, dice Sevcenko , que dirige el centro de rehabilitación Diva Crows con el objetivo de devolver las aves a su hábitat natural .\nLa Wildlife Rescue League de Falls Church , Virginia, se puso en contacto con Sevcenko y le preguntó si podía acoger a un raro cuervo blanco volantón que había traído un buen samaritano el mes pasado.\nCatherine Sevcenko dirige Diva Crows, un centro especializado en rehabilitación de aves en Alexandria. (Joseph Capone) El hombre dijo que había rescatado al ave en Manassas , Virginia, después de ver a un grupo de cuervos adultos “lanzarse en picado” y atacar al raro volantón , dijo Sevcenko . El cuervo juvenil no había desarrollado suficiente fuerza en sus alas para salir volando.\n“Les dije: ‘Por supuesto, me llevaré el pájaro’’”, dijo Sevcenko , de 62 años.\nDecidió bautizar al joven cuervo con el nombre de Hope ( Esperanza) , porque había leído leyendas que decían que los cuervos blancos eran un buen augurio y un signo de cambio positivo .\nEl ave tenía sólo unos meses y estaba un poco baja de peso, pero no parecía tener ninguna herida , dijo Sevcenko , señalando que aún no sabe si el cuervo es macho o hembra.\n“Le hicimos pruebas, pero el laboratorio perdió la muestra y ahora mismo no quiero volver a pincharle las venas ”, dijo. “Pero todo el mundo se refiere a ella como hembra, así que eso es lo que vamos a hacer”.\nCuervos adultos atacaron a Hope, dejándola vulnerable hasta que fue rescatada en Manassas. (Joseph Capone) Un veterinario determinó que Hope no era un cuervo albino puro , algo que ocurre en uno de cada 30.000 a 100.000 cuervos. Como sus plumas primarias son de color caramelo, no blancas, el veterinario la diagnosticó como amelanística, dijo Sevcenko, lo que significa que Hope no tiene melanina para producir plumas negras.\n“Es toda una anomalía ; el veterinario nunca había visto una como ella”, afirma.\nSevcenko dedica su tiempo libre a ayudar a aves necesitadas desde 2012. Con la ayuda de voluntarios , calcula que Diva Crows ha rehabilitado más de 2.000 aves, entre arrendajos azules , petirrojos , pájaros carpinteros , alcaravanes y cardenales .\nEn 2023, Sevcenko acogió a un cuervo de medio metro de altura al que habían disparado con una escopeta de perdigones en Chantilly, Virginia. Aunque el pájaro ya no podía volar y no podía ser liberado después de curarse, ella le encontró un hogar en el Cayuga Nature Center de Ithaca, Nueva York.\nDice que su plan es que Hope también tenga un futuro como ave educativa .\nHope, diagnosticada como amelanística, sobrevivió a pesar de no tener plumas negras comunes. (Joseph Capone) “Queríamos hacer todo lo posible para devolverla a la naturaleza , pero hay demasiados peligros para un ave que se parece a ella”, dijo Sevcenko . “Las posibilidades de que la acepten son bastante escasas , dado su aspecto y su forma de actuar”.\nSevcenko dijo que no sabe por qué Hope fue atacada por otros cuervos , pero añadió que el ave podría haber sido abandonada por sus padres, lo que la dejó vulnerable. También existe la posibilidad de que se cayera del nido o se adentrara en el territorio de otros cuervos .\n“Los cuervos son muy territoriales cuando tienen sus propias crías, y no les gusta compartir recursos ”, explicó.\nSevcenko dijo que también le preocupaba que Hope hubiera dejado huella en los humanos .\n“La persona que recogió a la corneja la tuvo unos días antes de ponerse en contacto con la Wildlife Rescue League . “Cuando llegó aquí, se sentía muy cómoda con la gente, lo cual no es normal”.\nLos cuervos blancos enfrentan múltiples peligros en la naturaleza, incluidos problemas de visión. (Joseph Capone) Incluso sin esos factores, Sevcenko dijo que el ave se enfrentaría a múltiples peligros en la naturaleza.\n“Cuando los cuervos blancos son rechazados, se ven obligados a vivir solos, lo que para un cuervo es algo tortuoso ”, dijo, señalando que los cuervos son aves sociales, orientadas a la familia , que viven en grupos .\n“Son aves increíblemente inteligentes y, en grupo , no son objetivo de los depredadores como lo sería una corneja blanca ”, explica Sevcenko .\nLas cornejas blancas pueden desarrollar problemas de visión , lo que les dificulta la caza, y pueden morir de hambre .\n“Una de las razones por las que son tan raros es que rara vez llegan a reproducirse ”, añadió Sevcenko .\nElla y sus voluntarios pusieron brevemente a Hope en una jaula con algunos cuervos negros en ciernes rescatados y no hubo ningún problema, dijo.\nUn veterinario declaró que Hope no puede ser liberada en libertad por su alto riesgo. (Joseph Capone) Luego la pusieron con un cuervo adulto . Las cosas no fueron bien.\n“Acabó atacándole”, explica Sevcenko . “Es un espécimen muy interesante. Le encanta explorar y se posa en tu brazo. Le gusta pasar el rato en rehabilitación para supervisar lo que ocurre”.\nTodos los que pasan tiempo con Hope están encantados con su personalidad , dice Tijona Owens, interna de Diva Crows .\n“Le encantan los baños para pájaros y, cuando la cambiamos de jaula , se sienta encima y te habla como si fuera una personita ”, explica. “Es muy ruidosa y siempre tiene hambre ”.\nCome croquetas para perros ricas en proteínas , arándanos , ratones y corazón de pollo troceado .\nSevcenko afirma que dos veterinarios le han dicho que Hope no puede ser liberada en libertad, por lo que planea buscar un centro de educación sobre fauna salvaje que pueda acogerla.\n“Me gusta mucho tenerla cerca, pero creo que será un buen ave educativa ”, afirma. “Es única en su especie”.\n(c) 2024, The Washington Post",

    "title": "Blinken disiente de la comparación de su \"amigo\" Lula sobre Gaza y el Holocausto",
    "text": "MADRID, 23 Feb. (EUROPA PRESS) - El secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Antony Blinken, ha afirmado este jueves que está en desacuerdo con las declaraciones que hizo recientemente su \"amigo\" el presidente de Brasil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, en las que comparaba la ofensiva israelí sobre Gaza con el exterminio de judíos cometido por Adolf Hitler. \"Tenemos diferencias sobre algunas cuestiones y la forma en la que las abordamos. Sobre esta cuestión en particular, obviamente no estamos de acuerdo con la comparación de Gaza con el Holocausto. Pero eso también es algo que hacen los amigos\", ha declarado al ser preguntado al respecto durante una rueda de prensa. En este sentido, Blinken ha afirmado que pueden \"tener estos desacuerdos, incluso desacuerdos profundos, sobre un tema en particular\", o \"incluso sobre un aspecto de un tema\", y \"aún así continuar con todo el trabajo vital que estamos haciendo\". \"También estamos unidos para tener objetivos compartidos en este momento como sacar a los rehenes, lograr un alto el fuego humanitario extendido, junto con más asistencia humanitaria, y poner fin al conflicto. Ese es un objetivo compartido\", ha remarcado el jefe de la diplomacia estadounidense. Blinken ha realizado estas declaraciones desde Río de Janeiro, donde se encuentra por la celebración de la cumbre del G20, y un día después de haberse reunido con Lula, donde trataron las relaciones entre ambos países, la protección del medio ambiente o temas internacionales, como la situación en Ucrania y Gaza, las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana por el control del Esequibo. En cuanto al encuentro, ha afirmado que \"no podría haber estado más satisfecho\" de la \"calidad de la conversación\" entre ambos y le ha agradecido \"todo el tiempo\" que el presidente brasileño \"dedicó\" a la reunión, sí como el contenido de la misma. \"Estábamos enfocados casi por completo en la muy importante y poderosa agenda común que comparten Estados Unidos y Brasil cuando se trata de los grandes desafíos de nuestro momento\", ha explicado. \"Esa fue casi la totalidad de nuestra conversación, y refleja el hecho de que, en muchos sentidos, la visión que aporta el Lula es la misma que tiene el presidente (estadounidense, Joe) Biden. Y como representante de Biden, mi propósito era realmente seguir profundizando ese enfoque común y seguir buscando formas prácticas en las que podamos avanzar en él\", ha concluido.",
