    "text": "A squad of Myanmar pro-democracy fighters works to ready drones for an attack on a nearby military base, the target in a wave of aerial assaults that has helped turn the war against the junta.\nNew Delhi: India on Thursday expressed concern at the violence and instability in Myanmar on the third anniversary of the 2021 coup by the junta and said developments there have direct implications for the security of the country.\nThe remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal came hours after Myanmar’s military rulers extended a state of emergency that has been in place since the coup that ousted the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi three years ago. The junta’s grip on power have been tested by a string of military successes by pro-democracy resistance forces since last October.\n“We are concerned with the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, which has direct implications for us. As a neighbouring country and friend of Myanmar, India has been long advocating for complete cessation of violence and Myanmar’s transition towards inclusive, federal democracy,” Jaiswal told a regular media briefing.\n“We want an early resolution of the issue through constructive dialogue and the return of peace and stability in the country,” he said.\nIndia’s concerns were related to all the developments in Myanmar, including the security situation, instability and violence, Jaiswal said.\nOn Wednesday, the United States imposed further sanctions on Myanmar, which targeted two entities and several people closely associated with the junta. The sanctions were aimed at the fuel the junta uses to conduct air strikes as part of its offensive against resistance forces and the military’s ability to manufacture arms.\nThe coup by the military on February 1, 2021 sparked nationwide chaos and ended a decade of democracy and economic reforms. It also sparked uprisings by armed ethnic groups in different parts of Myanmar.\nLast October, the most powerful anti-junta forces – Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Arakan Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) – jointly launched a campaign that has seen the resistance capture at least 35 towns, including key trade posts and crossings on the borders with India and China.\nHundreds of Myanmar military personnel have surrendered to the resistance forces in Shan and Rakhine states. More than 600 Myanmar troops also crossed the border with India to escape the fighting and were subsequently repatriated. Thousands of people from Myanmar have also sought refuge in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur and Mizoram.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "text": "En mayo se prevé la finalización de la etapa invernal en la región Costa de Ecuador, que en los últimos meses generó importantes afectaciones a los diferentes cultivos.\nEl ministro de Agricultura y Ganadería, Danilo Palacios, realizó ayer un balance actualizado de la afectación del agro por el invierno. Señaló que hasta el último reporte del 6 de mayo existían 28.000 hectáreas afectadas con pérdida total y 12.000 hectáreas con pérdida parcial.\nEl secretario de Estado recordó que el balance de las afectaciones se realiza de manera diaria para conocer la situación de los diferentes cultivos, en especial los más impactados, como el arroz, el maíz y el cacao.\nPublicidad\nEn este contexto, según lo dicho por Palacios, el arroz sigue siendo el cultivo con mayor afectación por la época invernal con 18.000 hectáreas de pérdida total y 2.000 hectáreas de pérdida parcial.\n“El 50 % de los cultivos más afectados es el arroz, luego vienen maíz y cacao”, sostuvo el ministro Palacios, ayer en Guayaquil, durante la rueda de negocios del maíz.\nMientras que respecto a las bonificaciones, señaló que hasta el martes pasado se han entregado a 12.000 productores ayudas de $ 800, que suman alrededor de $ 10 millones.\nPublicidad\nEsto se trata del bono Catta-Nuevo Ecuador, que fue creado el 27 de marzo pasado con el Decreto Ejecutivo 587, con la finalidad de mitigar el impacto económico de la precipitación pluvial y permitir la continuidad de las actividades productivas, garantizando la soberanía alimentaria nacional.\nSin embargo, Palacios reconoció que están optimizando los recursos, tratando de focalizar esa ayuda para llegar a los productores que han tenido mayores afectaciones por este invierno.\nPublicidad\n“Nosotros aún estamos en funciones prorrogadas y estamos tratando de optimizar al máximo los recursos heredados de la administración anterior”, explicó.\nDe todas maneras proyectó que se podría ayudar a unos 3.000 productores más. “Vamos a tratar de hallar las áreas más afectadas y ojalá ese volumen que tenemos nos dé para asistir a todos”, indicó el ministro.

    "text": "Mongolia won't fund the Siberia-2 pipeline for the next four years, Radio Free Europe reports. The natural gas pipeline is an ambitious project to deepen trade between Russia and China. The pipeline already hit a snag as Moscow and Beijing face disagreements. Plans for an ambitious natural-gas pipeline between Russia and China have hit a hitch, caused by a completely separate country: Mongolia.\nAccording to Radio Free Europe , Mongolia's government did not include funding for the Power of Siberia-2 pipeline in its spending plans for the next four years. The country serves as a buffer state between both Russia and China, and its engagement would be necessary for the project's realization.\nThis fresh snag adds complications to an already uncertain mega-project.\nRussian energy giant Gazprom started design and survey work on the pipeline in 2022 , projecting that it could deliver 1.8 trillion cubic feet of Russian natural gas to China each year\nThis would make the Siberia-2 pipeline Gazprom's biggest deal with Beijing, and could provide a much-needed solution to Western sanctions. After Russia invaded Ukraine the same year, energy restrictions on Moscow have crippled its gas trade.\nResearch commissioned by the firm found that Gazprom is unlikely to recover gas sales lost to the Ukraine war for at least a decade, placing a greater need on Siberia-2's deployment.\nBut Chinese counterparts face much less pressure, given that the country does not need more gas before the mid-2030s , energy experts have said. For this reason, pipeline negotiations have stalled between Beijing and Moscow, given price and supply level disputes.\nAccording to Radio Free Europe, plans for the pipeline also contradict China's increasing shift towards green energy.\nMoreover, the Siberia-2 project isn't China's only option: President Xi Jinping has also signaled support for the Line D pipeline, deepening ties with Turkmenistan.\nExpanded access to Eastern markets has proven to be a lifeline for Russia as the West has increasingly shunned the Kremlin. China has been front and center in this transition, with bilateral trade ballooning to a record $240 billion last year.\nWith Moscow highly dependent on its relationship with Beijing, some experts have characterized it as an emerging vassal to China .\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

(Gerald Bauman/650 CKOM)\nAfter a previous light show on Monday , the aurora borealis returned to the sky overnight, putting on a dazzling show for many people across Saskatchewan.\nThe swirling lights were clearly visible in Saskatoon, despite the light pollution that often makes the phenomenon difficult to view from densely populated areas.\nThe lights could be seen in Saskatoon on Thursday despite the local light pollution. (Peter Frederiksen/Submitted)\nThe skies over the Bridge City were filled with dancing bands of green, red, pink and purple, which were captured on film by a number of local photographers.\nThe skies putting on a show, and we have front row seats 🌌✨ @CKOMNews @CJMENews #yxe #saskatoon #LandOfLivingSkies pic.twitter.com/0Gfk3WdoLn\n— Alex Brown (@AlexBrownYXE) October 11, 2024\nDr. Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen, who took a number of snaps of the aurora this week , said watching the northern lights was a fantastic experience.\nDr. Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen said it was a fantastic experience to watch the colours dancing in the night sky. (Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen/Submitted)\n“As I stood under the vast expanse of the sky, I was struck by the ethereal quality of the lights. They shimmered and danced, evoking a profound sense of awe and tranquility,” Yaseen said.\nThe northern lights were even brighter outside of the city near Clavet. (Gerald Bauman/650 CKOM)\n“This display was not merely a visual feast; it served as a poignant reminder of the beauty and power of nature. The experience left me feeling deeply connected to the universe, as if I was witnessing a cosmic ballet.”\nNorthern Lights so strong tonight you can see them over downtown Saskatoon. @CKOMNews #YXE pic.twitter.com/WxHuwVfSLg\n— Shane (@ShaneC06) October 11, 2024\n(Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen/Submitted)\nAccording to the Canadian Space Agency, the northern lights, or aurora borealis, are caused when the Sun shoots charged electrons and protons out into space in a phenomenon called solar wind.\nBands of pink and green took over the night sky on Thursday. (Gerald Bauman/650 CKOM)\nThe Earth’s magnetic field then launches those charged particles down towards the planet’s surface along the magnetic field lines. Northern lights occur when these charged particles launched along Earth’s magnetic field collide with gases in the upper atmosphere. Those collisions produce tiny flashes of light that fill the sky with colours.\nThe northern lights lit up the sky in the Saskatoon area like fireworks. (Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen/Submitted)\nThe northern lights were visible over the University of Saskatchewan campus on Thursday. (Devan Mescall/Submitted)\nThis light works the same way as a neon lamp or an old cathode ray tube television set. As billions of flashes occur in sequence, the aurora appears to move or dance in the sky.\n(Vicky Parohl/Submitted)\nSend us your stories, photos and video Did see the northern lights in your area?
