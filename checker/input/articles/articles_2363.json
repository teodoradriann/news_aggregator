    "text": "‘A slap in the face’: Attorney representing Sade Robinson’s family criticizes information release in murder case, WISN reports 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson is charged with murdering 19-year-old Sade Robinson after a first date in April MILWAUKEE, Wis. ( [WISN](https://www.wisn.com/article/a-slap-in-the-face-attorney-representing-sade-robinsons-family-criticizes-information-release-in-murder-case/61820953)) - The attorney representing the family of murdered 19-year-old Sade Robinson is calling the release of information in Robinson’s murder “a slap in the face,” according to a report from WISN, Action 2 News’ Milwaukee affiliate. [A recently unsealed search warrant obtained by WISN 12 News](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-informant-reveals-anderson-planned-to-kill-dismember-robinson/61805317) Tuesday highlights a statement a confidential police informant made to Milwaukee police detectives. The informant claims 33-year-old Maxwell Anderson, charged in Robinson’s murder, had a plan to kill Robinson for weeks before the murder took place. Attorney Verona Swanigan, representing Robinson’s family, tells WISN 12 News that family members first heard this information from news reports Tuesday. “Anderson is calculated and callous, and he treated Sade Robinson like prey,” Swanigan said in a statement to WISN 12 News Wednesday. Robinson was last seen alive out on a dinner date with Anderson to Milwaukee’s Twisted Fisherman on April 1. The next day, someone found her severed leg at Warnimont Park in Cudahy. Days later, her burned-out car and other body parts were found near 30th Street and Lisbon Avenue in Milwaukee. [Anderson was charged with killing her on April 12.](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-man-charged-with-homicide-in-severed-leg-investigation/60479757) In the newly unsealed search warrants obtained by WISN 12 News, detectives said a confidential informant was inside Anderson’s basement on March 5 — weeks before Robinson’s murder. The informant described a room in the basement with a sanitation sink and tarps “taped to the floor and the ceiling, covering the walls and the floor.” The informant also told investigators Anderson detailed a plan to shoot Robinson before dismembering her in the basement and “disposing her body throughout the city.” “It all indicates a pattern of behavior by Maxwell Anderson that is vile, heinous, evil - that must be investigated further,” Swanigan said. Swanigan said Robinson’s family first heard about these gruesome details from news reports, and now she is asking for advance notice from officials before such documents are unsealed. Robinson’s mother, Sheena Scarbrough, tells WISN 12 News that finding out new details about her daughter’s murder from the news is deeply upsetting. “The devastation and the heartache that it’s taking on her to find all of this out in piecemeal portions...It sort of feels like a slap in the face,” Swanigan said about Scarbrough. Swanigan also tells WISN 12 News Robinson’s family doesn’t understand why the confidential informant didn’t come forward with the details of Anderson’s plan before Robinson’s murder. “Are these questions really eating at Sade’s family?” asked WISN 12 News reporter Emily Pofahl. “They are. They are disturbing to them,” Swanigan said. Maxwell Anderson’s lawyer is disputing the informant’s claims. Attorney Anthony Cotton said in a statement to WISN 12 News that “information from people who want to be labeled as ‘confidential informants’ is often false and exaggerated.” Anderson is currently being held in the Milwaukee County Jail, charged with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilation of a corpse and arson. [He has pleaded not guilty.](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-man-maxwell-anderson-charged-killing-dismembering-milwaukee-teen-sade-robinson-not-guilty-plea/60571146) Anderson’s trial is scheduled for December.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in LaSalle County, Illinois from 1901-2000 was 26.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did LaSalle County, Illinois experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in LaSalle County, Illinois history.",

    "text": "Saúde/bem-estar\n19/12/2024 às 18:00•2 min de leituraAtualizado em 19/12/2024 às 18:00\nParcialmente (ou completamente) viciados em telas nos últimos anos da tecnologia digital, não temos noção de que esse é um dos motivos de a nossa capacidade de atenção estar reduzida. Um livro recente do neurologista americano Richard E. Cytowic tenta explicar esse fenômeno moderno através do nosso cérebro ancestral.\nEm Seu cérebro da idade da pedra na era da tela: lidando com a distração digital e a sobrecarga sensorial, Cytowic argumenta que, como nosso cérebro não mudou significativamente desde a Idade da Pedra, estamos mal equipados para lidar com o fascínio das tecnologias modernas.\nPara o autor, o estresse gerado por essa sobrecarga informacional afeta diretamente nossa homeostase, mecanismo interno de autorregulação face às mudanças do ambiente externo. O raciocínio é simples: o cérebro tem limites fixos de energia, sentir-se sobrecarregado leva ao estresse, que leva à distração que, por sua vez, leva ao erro. Há então duas soluções possíveis: parar o fluxo de informações ou aliviar o estresse acumulado.\nPara Cytowic, a sobrecarga visual representa hoje um desafio maior do que a auditiva, pois as conexões olho-cérebro superam as conexões ouvido-cérebro em aproximadamente três vezes. Para isso, nossa percepção evoluiu para priorizar entradas simultâneas, ou seja, décimos de segundo entre a captação na retina e a compreensão no córtex visual primário.\nEssa sobrecarga é amplificada pelos smartphones, que bombardeiam nossos sentidos com fluxos constantes de informação. Enquanto nossos ancestrais processavam somente estímulos naturais, temos que lidar com \"um espectro eletromagnético massivo de dados e sinais\", afirma o escritor.\nEnquanto a capacidade de absorver e processar informações em nossos corpos continua a mesma, a capacidade de armazenamento digital disparou, de gigabytes a zettabytes. Essa disparidade entre capacidade tecnológica e biológica cria um descompasso que afeta diretamente a concentração e o processamento mental.\nEstudos sobre nossa capacidade de atenção mostram, segundo Cytowic, que, em 2004, as pessoas mantinham foco por 150 segundos entre trocas de tela; em 2012, esse tempo caiu para apenas 47 segundos. A neurociência cria três classificações para explicar como o cérebro lida com demandas de concentração e foco: sustentada, seletiva e alternada.\nA neurociência alerta para os custos energéticos dessa constante mudança de foco, que pode resultar em problemas de memória e concentração. Dispositivos inteligentes exigem respostas imediatas, condicionando-nos a um estado permanente de interrupção e realocação de recursos mentais.\nEm termos do custo de energia consumida pela mudança repetida de atenção ao longo do dia, \"temo que tenhamos atingido o limite da Idade da Pedra do cérebro\", diz Cytowic. Ultrapassar esse limite pode resultar em pensamento nebuloso, foco reduzido, bloqueio de pensamento, lapso de memória ou falta de precisão mental, conclui o neurologista.",
