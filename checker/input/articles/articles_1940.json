    "text": "Boeing (NYSE: [BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA)) workers overwhelmingly voted to reject a proposed labor contract and are set to strike, with the work stoppage beginning at midnight. Approximately 33,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) voted 96% in favor of the strike, far exceeding the two-thirds majority required to initiate a walkout. The rejected contract included a 25% raise over four years. However, the union argued that these terms fell short of addressing the rising cost of living, as negotiators sought raises closer to 40%. This strike adds to the [already turbulent times](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19846505-strike-add-to-turbulent-times-boeing) at Boeing ( [BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA)) after such recent incidents as a much-publicized emergency exit blowout, the departure of the firm's CEO and Senate hearings. In addition, the vote is a blow to CEO Kelly Ortberg, who urged the union members not to vote in favor of a strike as it would disrupt production and hurt its struggling factory operations. \"Their tireless efforts have been on display throughout this entire process. Now, they will regroup and begin planning the next steps on securing an agreement that our membership can approve,\" the IAM said in a [statement](https://www.goiam.org/news/iam-union-fully-supports-district-751-and-w24-members-after-rejecting-boeing-contract/). A 30-day strike could cost almost $1.5B to Boeing ( [BA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA)) and have an impact on supply chains, according to a CNBC report. The work stoppage will impact the giant's aircraft production, including its best-selling 737 Max.",

    "text": "Why there’s perennial water stagnation on Tambaram NH\nPoor engineering works have blocked rainwater channels from Pachamalai to Chitlapakkam lake and 3 others\nCHENNAI: Every year when the monsoon hits, the National Highway in Tambaram turns to a pit from hell, with rainwater stagnating and mixing with sewage, even after a mild shower.\nPoor engineering works have blocked the rainwater channels between Pachamalai and Chitlapakkam lake, making the NH flood during every monsoon. The people want authorities to repair the channel and enable the water to flow from the hill to the lake.\nMembers of the Environment Awareness and Protection Association (EAPA) said, “The government’s poor engineering works has blocked and obstructed the water from Pachaimalai hills to Chitlapakkam lake.”\nSituated in Tambaram Sanatorium, Pachaimalai is home to mane native herbs, which is convenient for the Tambaram Sanatorium Thoracic Medicine Hospital located close to the hill. During the monsoon, rainwater from the hill flows into 4 channels – Chitlapakkam lake, Tiruneermalai lake, Veeraragavan lake and Kadaperi lake. Residents claimed that rainwater from the hill keeps them healthy due to the presence of herbs in them.\nHowever, a few years ago when the Highways department extended the Chennai-Tiruchy NH and, the Tambaram-Beach Meter Gauge Rail Track was replaced by a broad gauge, the water channels connecting Pachaimalai with the Chitlapakkam lake and Tiruneermalai lake – both of which are underground, were damaged.\nFor the past 15 years, water from the hills has not flowed into the lake as the water channels have been encroached upon by the NH. So, the NH, Tambaram Sanatorium Hospital, Chromepet GH and the surrounding areas get inundated each year, creating a lot of hardships for the residents there.\nRecently, the EAPA filed a petition with the CM Stalin in which the Water Resource Department stated: “During inspection, it was found that the existing culvert on the NH is not sufficient to carry the water from the hills to the Chitlapakkam lake. The NH is requested to reconstruct the culvert.”\nSocial activist and convenor of the EAPA, P Viswanathan, said that poor planning and improper construction of culverts cause flooding along the GST Road, Chromepet GH and Thoracic Medicine Hospital. “The Highways department should ensure water flows across GST Road to reach the Chitlapakkam lake. WRD and Tambaram Corporation must desilt and make sure rainwater flows to the Chitlapakkam lake,” he added.\nWhen contacted, an official from the NHAI, said that it had constructed a new culvert a few months ago across the GST Road, which was big enough to handle the rainwater from the hill. “Even now, if WRD wants us to modify the culvert, we’re ready to complete it, but the WRD should ensure the water pathway to Chitlapakkam lake is equally big enough and not encroached,” he opined.",

Trump denies Daniels' claim and that he broke any laws.\nThe jury saw texts between Pecker and Dylan Howard, the editor in chief at the National Enquirer at the time. Pecker said Howard was unable to travel for the trial, but Thursday's testimony provided insight about what the publication thought about Daniels' story.\nTrump trial live updates: David Pecker testifies about contract with Karen McDougal\n'This story is true:' Dylan Howard texted David Pecker about Stormy Daniels Howard texted Pecker that a woman wanted $120,000 for her story, according to texts shown to the jury at Trump's hush money trial.\nPecker testified the woman he was referencing was Stormy Daniels.\n\"I know the denials were made in the past – but this story is true,\" Howard's texts shown to the jurors said, adding that the woman had other offers from \"Mail\" and \"GMA.\"\nPecker testified he refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story Pecker said he refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story. He texted Dylan Howard: \"We can't pay 120k.\" Pecker explained on the stand that he was not a bank and had already paid hush money to Dino Sajudin and Karen McDougal to help Trump.\nSajudin was a doorman at Trump Tower who alleged Trump had a love child with a housekeeper in the building. Pecker testified Tuesday that he did not believe Sajudin's story.\nPecker also said he didn't want to be involved with a porn star.\n\"Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there, and handle,\" Howard responded to Pecker, referring to Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, according to text messages displayed to the jury.\nAfter Pecker refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story, Cohen was upset and told Pecker the boss \"would be furious with me,\" Pecker testified. Pecker still insisted he wouldn't go forward with purchasing it.\nNY court will publish transcripts from Trump's hush money trial. Here's how you can access them.

Stormy Daniels , born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump's subsequent reimbursement of Cohen, which he listed as legal expenses, is at the heart of prosecutors' allegation that the payments constituted an illegal campaign contribution by Cohen that Trump tried to hide by falsifying records.\nWho is David Pecker? David Pecker , former CEO and president of American Media Inc., is the first witness on the stand at Trump's Manhattan criminal trial .\nPecker has testified that he was frequently in touch with Michael Cohen leading up to the 2016 election. Pecker said he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" about women selling stories about Trump, as part of a bigger effort to try to help his presidential campaign.\nThe company was also fined $187,500 by the FEC for helping Trump's election, but the Justice Department granted Pecker immunity from prosecution.\nContributing: Bart Jansen",

The previous govt under ex-CM Uddhav Thackeray did nothing during its entire tenure. I understand the seriousness of the issue and that existing industries must be provided land for shifting.”Contradicting Fadnavis, Nana Patole said the MVA government had in fact ordered closure of these factories, but said corruption allowed them to continue. “It is the responsibility of the government to protect lives of people,” Patole said.We also published the following articles recentlyMaharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis tops rally tally at 116Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis held a record 116 public rallies for Mahayuti candidates across Maharashtra for the Lok Sabha seats, with a focus on Vidharbha.110346110MVA, govt in blame game over chem units relocation156 chemical industrial units from Dombivli MIDC are to be relocated to Patalganga in Raigad district.

    "text": "FBI probe of Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles is serious. District 5 voters don't seem to care The question Tennessee congressional District 5 voters should ask themselves at the polls is which candidate will best represent their values in Congress. The FBI confiscated incumbent [District 5 U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ phone](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/06/fbi-confiscates-rep-andy-ogles-phone-amid-campaign-finance-issues/74692131007/) the day after he won the Aug. 1 Republican primary election. Two things can be true: First, Ogles should not be presumed guilty of anything. This is an investigation, not a trial, and the congressman said in [a post on X](https://x.com/AndyOgles/status/1820916720510357929) that he plans to cooperate with authorities. “I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more,” he said. Second, this investigation does not mean that the Biden Administration singularly targeted Ogles for political purposes despite speculation about a deep-state conspiracy theory from his supporters on social media. Republican politicians, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, have accused the [White House of engaging in “lawfare,”](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/30/trump-conviction-trump-felon-tennessee-lawmakers-reacted-to-the-verdict/73912596007/) or using the power of the government to go after rivals including former President Donald Trump. No other Tennessee member of Congress is being probed by the FBI Nevertheless, this inquiry is incredibly serious and it is important to note that none of Tennessee’s other members of Congress, all Republicans except one – two senators and eight representatives besides Ogles – have had their property seized by law enforcement. Not Senators Marsha Blackburn or Bill Hagerty. Not Republican U.S. Reps. Diana Harshbarger (District 1), Tim Burchett (District 2), Chuck Fleischmann (District 3), Scott DesJarlais (District 4), John Rose (District 6), Mark Green (District 7) or David Kustoff (District 8). Not Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen (District 9). Trump-backed Ogles [filed articles of impeachment](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/23/andy-ogles-files-impeachment-articles-against-vp-kamala-harris/74517856007/) against Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. However, Green, in District 7, successfully led the effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, though the Senate did not convict the Cabinet secretary. Trump calls Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee [a phony Republican. This deserves a response.](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/david-plazas/2024/08/06/trump-tennessee-gov-bill-lee-republican-insult-rino/74688154007/) This goes to show that political disagreements and rhetoric do not lead to lawfare. Ogles has faced campaign finance problems since he was elected Ogles said in his post that he believes the FBI is investigating him over campaign finance filing irregularities. The District 5 congressman, who was elected in 2022, has faced campaign finance problems for the last two years. The Tennessean reported that he was required to pay [$5,750 in civil penalties for violations](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/andy-ogles-pays-fec-fine/article_1cdd47c4-9484-11ee-898a-6f40d83b66c7.html) during the 2022 election cycle. A [$320,000 loan to himself](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/andy-ogles-pays-fec-fine/article_1cdd47c4-9484-11ee-898a-6f40d83b66c7.html), which was reported as cash to the Federal Elections Commission, turned out to be just a pledge for the 2024 election, Ogles recently admitted. Voters in District 5, which includes all or parts of Davidson, Wilson, Williamson and Maury counties, knew this information. VP Kamala Harris word salads [reveal something sinister about her political worldview](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/civility/2024/08/07/election-2024-kamala-harris-word-salads-ideology/74693347007/) In fact, Ogles’ GOP opponent Courtney Johnston ran a better-financed campaign exploiting these irregularities. But the 54.8% of voters who backed Ogles on Aug. 1 did not know or did not care. Will District 5 voters think Ogles or Abolfazli is a better fit? The FBI will not comment on the investigation, but the Department of Justice typically does not overtly take investigative action against candidates 60 days prior to an election, The Tennessean reports. Now, the news is out and voters in the Republican-leaning district – which was created in a 2022 gerrymander that diluted Nashville-Davidson County’s vote – will have to decide if the phone seizure is relevant. Ogles faces Democrat [Maryam Abolfazli](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/editorials/2024/07/01/tennessee-election-congress-maryam-abolfazli-house-district-5/74268649007/) in the Nov. 5 general election. In a statement Tuesday, she said, “The FBI’s execution of a search warrant and confiscation of Andy Ogles’ cell phone is deeply upsetting, especially given an ongoing pattern of misappropriated funds and falsehoods regarding his education and work history.” Johnston could not make the case that this mattered to the majority of voters in District 5. Will the FBI’s phone seizure make a difference in November? The question voters should ask themselves at the polls is which candidate will best represent their values in Congress. The answer on Nov. 5 will be incredibly revealing. David Plazas is the director of opinion and engagement for the USA TODAY Network Tennessee. He is an editorial board member of The Tennessean.

    "text": "Until compatibility issues are properly addressed, it'll never stand up to x86 Analysis Qualcomm has set its sights on Arm-based Windows laptops, which, in theory, offer notable advantages. The company's Arm-powered Snapdragon processors promise exceptional battery life that puts x86 machines to shame, fanless designs, and integrated 5G connectivity that leave Intel and AMD looking dated. By betting on a mobile and connected world, Qualcomm aims to position Arm-based Windows laptops as the future.\nBut there's a problem: software compatibility. Qualcomm's strategy relies on the assumption that users will prioritize battery life and always-on connectivity over a critical aspect of computing devices.\nFor Windows users, a thin and long-lasting device isn't enough if it can't run the applications they depend on daily – applications optimized for x86 architecture over the span of decades. While Qualcomm may have its \"Windows revolution\" mapped out, the reality is that Windows on Arm continues to struggle with compatibility issues that Qualcomm and Microsoft have yet to resolve. Is Qualcomm's Arm push overly optimistic?\nQualcomm's Windows on Arm strategy\nQualcomm's core selling points for Arm-based Windows laptops include significantly longer battery life compared to x86 machines. Thanks to Arm's efficiency, Snapdragon processors enable fanless laptops that remain cool and operational throughout the day, even in ultra-thin designs. Qualcomm is also stuffing 5G modems into these laptops, offering \"always-on, always-connected\" internet access aimed at students, remote workers, and just about anyone tired of battling unreliable Wi-Fi connections.\nQualcomm also emphasizes its focus on AI. The Snapdragon platform has a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU), which Qualcomm says can handle AI-driven tasks directly on the device without compromising performance. This aligns the company's designs with the current AI hype, suggesting these Arm machines can deliver \"next-generation AI experiences.\" Qualcomm also asserts these devices are…\nGavin Bonshor",
