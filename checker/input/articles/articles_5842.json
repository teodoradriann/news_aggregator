    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Parts of Malaysia have been baking under a heatwave, but brace yourself, the worse is yet to come, with a government report projecting severe dry spells next year and in 2026.\nAccording to Malaysia’s Third National Communication and Second Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), these dry spells will cause up to 36.3% decrease in rainfall in certain areas.\nReduced rainfall will affect raw water supplies, rice harvests, rubber and oil palm yields as well as livestock.\nThe report was prepared by the Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Ministry in 2018.\nAmong the areas that will be worst hit are the Sungai Dungun and Sungai Kemaman basins in Terengganu.\nFurther in the future, dry spells are projected to occur in Sarawak from 2045 to 2055, in the upper central region (Oya, Mukah, Tatau and Balingian river basins), northwest (Similajau, Suai, Niah and Sibuti river basins), as well as the Rajang, Saribas, Lupar and Kemena river basins.\nSabah, however, is not expected to be hit by such severe dry spells at that time.\nBased on findings from the El Nino phenomenon that occurred between March 2015 and April 2016, the report said affected dams could include the Padang Saga, Beris, Muda and Pedu dams (Kedah); Bukit Merah dam (Perak); Timah Tasoh dam (Perlis); Labong dam (Johor); Bukit Kwong dam (Kelantan); and Gemencheh dam (Negri Sembilan).\nWater levels at these dams fell below the 50% warning mark for at least three consecutive months, from January to August 2016.\n“Future projections indicate that these dams may face significant dry spells with a return period of more than 10 years by 2040.\n“Effective adaptation actions should be planned and implemented immediately to ensure sufficient water resources during these dry spell periods,” the report said.\nMajor rice planting areas in Peninsular Malaysia may also see drops in crop yields of between 6% to 31% from 2030 to 2050 due to climate change.\n“In particular, studies on dry spells indicate that around 106 water-deficit months will occur in these areas for those periods,” the report said.\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "54 factories in Savar-Ashulia region have been declared closed to bring workers back to work through the ongoing labor movement, cessation of violence and negotiations. The owners have taken this decision in accordance with Article 13, paragraph 1 of the Labor Law. In addition to this, 60 more garment factories are closed today. As a result, a total of 114 ready-made garment factories have been closed in the region.\nBGMEA Senior Vice President Abdullah Hill Rakib confirmed the matter to Jago News on Wednesday (September 11).\nThis BGMEA leader complained, we thought that if the demands were accepted, the workers would return to work. But now we see that they are completely politically motivated and have resorted to violence and vandalism.\nMany owners have closed factories under Section 13(1) to bring workers back to work. We expect workers to return to work by Saturday. Earlier, some factories in this area were closed. Later introduced through discussion. Rakib also said that the factory there is working well.\nHe said, ‘If the production of a factory is declared closed under Section 13 (1) of the Labour Act, the workers will not get any kind of wages. That is, if the workers do not work in these factories, they will not get wages. We also discussed this with the law enforcement agencies. They also agreed.”\n“Previously the owners had assured the workers that they would meet their demands regarding the attendance bonus and lunch. Since there is a regional problem, for the time being it has been done for this region.’\nIn response to a question about whether it will be applicable in other regions, Rakib said: “It will be considered subject to discussions with the owners and union leaders there.”\nHe also said, “We will meet with all kinds of local political leaders and try to solve the problem through discussion.”\nIHO/ASA/GKS\n#labor #law #announced #closure #garment #factories",

    "text": "Hey allll, guess who's back with another Lex/Scar story? ;) And this one's based off of \"Brighter Than the Sun\" by Colbie Caillat. Guys, I don't know what it is about these songs, but they keep giving me ideas (and it's totally not a bad thing)! S here's the story, I don't own the song, nor do I own AVP or any of their characters. Enjoy!! ** All rights reserved by me. I do not allow this work to be used or adapted in any way without my permission.** AN: I do not own the Alien vs Predator franchise or any of it's characters. Karen is an OC made up by me. X.x For the first time in forever, Lex Woods awoke without all the lights on. Her first thought, ironically, being wow, my electric bill isn't gonna be completely outrageous this time. Aside from her silly self jibe, it really did feel like an accomplishment. Stretching luxuriously in her bed, the rays from the sun being the only light source through the curtains, she felt better than she had in a long time. A lot of things contributed to this, like the fact that a year and three months later, she was finally allowing herself to move on. She wasn't ignorant to think that she could ever move on completely - she already knew this would be a scar she would bear forever (both literally and figuratively). But she could accept it for what it was, and she could forgive herself. It didn't hurt that she also had her partner in crime back. That was a positive. A smile crossed her lips as she lazed in her bed, folding her arms under her pillow behind her head. She had managed to befriend an extraterrestrial from another planet... If someone had told her ten years ago that that would await her in the future, she would've laughed in their face and told them they needed counseling. Right now it didn't sound nearly as silly as it had a few days after the incident had happened; it was a bit more believable in her mind now that she'd spent over a year thinking about it (and now a few months living it, breathing it, etc.). And now, this creature, this alien - this guy was now her best friend in the whole world (and beyond, she liked to tease herself by thinking). This thing they had been through together had indeed been horrible, but it had brought them together. As much as Lex hated the fact, she knew that it was because of this reason that she couldn't wish Bouvetoya hadn't happened. She wished with all her heart that there hadn't been casualties (on either side of the spectrum, as Scar had lost brothers as well), but if they hadn't gone in the first place, then there wouldn't have ever been the possibility of the two of them meeting. It was a small world, but what would the chances of meeting have been if it hadn't happened on the island? And if by some chance they had met, what would the circumstances have been? And also, what would the actual meeting have been like? Probably would've made my skull into one of his trophies he adores so much. She shuddered at the thought - her friend definitely had some interesting hobbies. In the past three months, Scar had figured out that she was not at all impressed by his human skull trophies, and absolutely did not want to hear about them. Begrudgingly, but understanding why, he didn't prod her about his escapades on Earth - unless of course he was describing scenery or something else that he'd seen. That is, describing being using all of clicking, hand motions, growling and broken english. It was kind of like charades, except he was able to speak some english, so it wasn't a complete guessing game. And the more he saw her, the more he learned. She knew he could understand everything she said - it was just getting him to actually talk to her in her own language that was a trial. Not that she minded - he didn't need to do that to make her happy. Really, he didn't need to do anything to make her happy other than exist. It sounded really cheesy, but she felt more connected with him, an alien, than she did with anyone on her home planet. She suspected that he felt the same; otherwise, he wouldn't be visiting her as frequently as he did. And she certainly wasn't complaining. In fact, she actually was attempting to figure a lot out for the near future, such as how the hell she was going to cope with her feelings for him. Lex sighed, crossing one leg over the other under her sheets. It was certainly a dilemma in her mind. She didn't even know if he could feel such a thing, himself. It worried her more than she would ever let on. Idly, her finger stroked the warrior mark on her cheek, the fingers of her left hand tracing the familiar edges. This would eat her alive if she didn't get it out, and no one in her life knew about Scar but herself. Her therapist didn't even know that she had interacted with, ahem, aliens during her nightmare journey. Maybe she would start by asking if his species had such a thing as partnership, of the romantic aspect. Yeah, that sounded innocent enough. He probably wouldn't question her motives, and if he did, she would just pass it off as curiosity. The fact that she actually cared what he thought about her said something. She didn't care what anybody thought of her; she never had. Lex knew how crazy it sounded to have a romantic interest in an alien - she was a rational minded woman, of course. But no one knew her quite like he did. No one understood her, but he came pretty damn close. No one made her feel like he did. Through all the time they'd spent together in the past few months, on his various visits to her planet, it had become even more clear. She sounded corny as hell, even to herself. She'd had boyfriends before, but never had she felt this strongly; like the God damn love bug bit her right in the heart. She could go on all day... Laying there, in her bed, feeling content for the first time in a long time, another thought came to her, and it made her snort: Who knew it would take a seven-foot-something humanoid with dreadlocks and mandibles to make her swoon. Wow.",

    "text": "GOBankingRates Want To Be a Millionaire? Embrace These 13 Habits Now Read full article John Csiszar 29 December 2023 at 1:00 am · 6-min read shapecharge / iStock/Getty Images\nOne million dollars is a number that many people set as a target for their retirement nest egg , and it has something of a mythical feel about it. The very idea of being a millionaire symbolizes great wealth for most Americans, and indeed only about 8.8% of Americans actually are millionaires, putting them in the category of the financial elite.\nExperts: Make These 7 Money Resolutions If You Want To Become Rich on an Average Salary\nLearn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHowever, there are concrete steps that anyone can take to increase their chances of reaching a seven-digit net worth. By starting early enough and implementing some of these financial steps, you may find yourself in this rarefied company more easily than you think .\nSponsored: Get Paid To Scroll. Start Now\nStart Investing Early Probably the single biggest step you can take towards achieving millionaire status is to start investing early. As Mark Cuban said, “When investing, the best thing you can do is start early.” Socking away as little as $200 per month when you are 20 can translate to over $1 million by age 65 if you earn an 8% return on your investments. While no investment return is guaranteed, the long-term average return of the S&P 500 index easily eclipses this 8% target. However, as billionaire Warren Buffet advised: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.” So, better to start now than not at all.\nSave Until It Hurts You might have heard that you should save at least 10% of your income to generate long-term wealth. While that’s a great start, if you want to become a millionaire , you’ll have to save until it hurts. This means different things for different people. If you’re only earning $25,000 per year, saving 10% of your money might hurt a little — but try pushing it to 15% or 20%. If you earn $200,000 per year, you might be able to push that savings rate to 50% or more. Or, to put it simply, listen to Buffet: “Do not save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.”\nStory continues I’m a Financial Advisor: Here’s the No. 1 Piece of Advice I Would Give My Younger Self\nInvest in Appreciating Assets, Not Depreciating Ones One of the most important steps in reaching millionaire status is to only put your money into investments that will generate a positive return for you. In plain English, this means you should be investing in assets that have demonstrated long-term earnings potential, like the stock market and real estate, not in assets that lose value every day, like new cars or consumer goods.\nContinually Increase Your Income The cost of living goes up nearly every year, so if your income doesn’t grow as well, you’ll never generate true wealth. Regularly ask for raises at your job so your income rises faster than the inflation rate. If you can’t squeeze any more money out of your current job, consider taking on a side gig or some type of additional work so you can continue to raise your income.\nGenerate Passive Income Millionaires and billionaires agree: Passive income is incredibly important to amassing a fortune. As Buffet said, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,” It’s hard to get wealthy just from earning a salary. But you can get to millionaire status a lot more quickly if you generate income that you don’t have to work for, known as passive income. A classic example is rental income. Once you buy a rental property, you’ll get paid every month by your renters without having to do any additional work beyond routine maintenance and repairs. If your rental income exceeds the amount you pay for your mortgage, property tax and other costs, you’re essentially using other people’s money to pay for your property while you sit and watch its value increase. Be like investor and author Robert Kiyosaki, who said, “my passive income exceeds my expenses. That’s financial independence.”\nPay Off Credit Card Debt Knocking down your credit card balances won’t earn you any money, but it might still be the best “investment” you ever make. If you carry a balance on your credit card, you may be paying interest of 20% or more annually. No investment you make can reliably generate those types of returns, so paying off any outstanding balances you have is one of the best possible uses of your money.\nMaximize Your 401(k) Match If you’re lucky enough to have a 401(k) match at your job, you absolutely must take advantage of it each and every year. A 401(k) match may be the closest thing to free money you’ll ever receive, and best of all, it’s deposited into a tax-advantaged investment account. Even if you can’t contribute the absolute maximum to your 401(k) every year, at least contribute enough to claim your full employer match.\nMaintain a Top-Tier Credit Score As financial guru Suze Orman said, “A good credit score is better than money.” A top-tier credit score won’t put any money in your pocket directly, but it can save you literally tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime, perhaps even more. With a credit score above 740, you can usually qualify for the lowest available interest rates on everything from home mortgages to auto loans, and the savings can really pile up. A $300,000, 30-year mortgage at 3.0% vs. 4.5%, for example, will save you over $74,000 in interest over the life of the loan.\nLive in an Affordable Community America is a vast country with plenty of comfortable places to live. If you can live in a lower-cost area while still earning the same salary, it’s the same as if you got a significant raise. As more and more companies are allowing their employees to work remotely, see if you can move to a less-expensive area and boost your savings rate to help you achieve millionaire status.\nBe Entrepreneurial and Take Calculated Risks “The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today,” said U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Millionaires are often willing to take smart risks to grow their money through new business ventures. Calculated risks and entrepreneurship can lead to greater reward.\nNetwork and Seek Mentorship Surrounding yourself with knowledgeable peers and mentors accelerates learning and unlocks opportunities. As Shark Tank’s Daymond John said,”Finding mentors has been key to my success.” Millionaires invest time in networking and mentor relationships.\nLearn Constantly and Improve Your Skills “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing,” said Buffett. Education and skill development are lifelong pursuits. Millionaires continually learn to expand their knowledge, abilities and opportunities.\nPractice Intentional Goal Setting Millionaires set clear goals for their money and review them regularly. Intentional goal setting and tracking progress are keys to success. “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work,” said American tycoon H. L. Hunt.\nLaura Beck contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nPocket an Extra $403 Per Month With This Simple Hack\nI Grew Up Poor: Here Are 8 Things I Never Waste Money On\nExperts: Make These 7 Money Resolutions If You Want To Become Rich on an Average Salary\nThe 7 Worst Things You Can Do If You Owe the IRS\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Want To Be a Millionaire?

    "text": "Lauren Alaina opened up about her pregnancy when she caught up with Kelly Clarkson on a new episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show on Thursday (January 23).\nAlaina’s appearance on the talk show takes place one day after her surprise pregnancy announcement . The Georgia-born country star debuted her growing baby bump for the first time as she released her newest single, “Those Kind Of Women,” and its heartfelt music video on Wednesday (January 22). The video ends with a dedication to “my Momma and our sweet Baby Arnold coming summer 2025.”\nAlaina, who married husband Cam Arnold in February 2024, said she’s “22 weeks (along)…which is a long time to hide a pregnancy, by the way. I’m very excited for people to know about this.\n“The song is called ‘ Those Kind Of Women ,’ and it’s all about the women who raised me,” Alaina said later when Clarkson asked about the sweet song and the surprise pregnancy announcement in the music video. “And this song means so much to me already, and then I recorded the song and mastered the song, and when I was getting the master back, I had found out that I was pregnant and no one knew except me and my husband. And I’m sobbing listening to the song. And I will say, my mom and I have always been very close, but it has changed. Oh my goodness, I’m so pregnant, I’m gonna cry about it,” Alaina paused as she began to feel emotional. “It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”\nAlaina is one of several country artists expecting a baby in 2025, along with a few other first-time parents. Most recently, Shay Mooney of Dan + Shay welcomed Baby No. 4 with wife Hannah Mooney . Days earlier, rising country star Sarahbeth Taite announced Baby No. 2’s arrival . Other artists welcoming a baby into the family this year include HARDY , Elle King , Sam Hunt and more. See the pregnancy announcements here .",

    "text": "The US Army’s Jointless Hull machine, hailed as the world’s largest additive and subtractive manufacturing apparatus, has earned the prestigious 2024 Technical Achievement Award for 3D Printing Innovation. Developed in collaboration with key partners, including Ingersoll Machine Tool, Siemens, and LIFT, this unique device has transformed manufacturing at the Rock Island Arsenal Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center.\nAs part of the U.S. Army’s $4.5 billion, 15-year modernization plan, the Jointless Hull prototype aligns with the vision of the Rock Island Arsenal Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center to lead the Army’s modernization efforts.\nChase Cox, Vice President of Meld Manufacturing, explains that the process mimics traditional blacksmithing, shaping metal under pressure and heat but with a sophisticated, machine-driven approach. The Jointless Hull’s substantial print volume of 20 ft x 30 ft x 12 ft opens avenues for large-scale 3D metal printing, potentially revolutionizing the production of equipment such as tank hulls.\n“To be able to 3D print something that is forging level quality didn’t exist until now,” said Edward Flinn, director of the Advanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence at RIA-JMTC.\n“In the past, except for some unique situations, it’s always been a weldment or assembly using conventional techniques. The joints were always the weakest section of the part. This new system makes it possible for people to not worry about the joints or seams because you can make it in one piece.”\nLooking ahead, the Jointless Hull’s future capabilities hold the promise of further advancements in 3D metal printing technology. Its potential to operate autonomously around the clock could significantly reduce manufacturing time while ensuring the delivery of stronger, more reliable components—charting a course for the next era of Army manufacturing.\nFor more info about the Jointless Hull project, check out our previous article below:\n[]https://3dprinting.com/news/rock-island-arsenal-to-house-largest-metal-3d-printer-in-the-world/\nSource:\narmy.mil\nCome and let us know your thoughts on our\nX, and weekly additive manufacturing newsletter to get all the latest stories delivered right to your inbox.",
