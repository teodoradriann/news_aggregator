    "title": "India's political parties urged to adopt 10-point press freedom program ahead of elections - IFEX",
    "text": "RSF asks India’s political parties to commit to press freedom by adopting ten key recommendations that aim to defend the right to reliable news and information and protect journalists. This statement was originally published on [rsf.org](https://rsf.org/en/india-s-political-parties-urged-adopt-10-point-press-freedom-programme-ahead-elections) on 12 April 2024. In response to the sharp decline in press freedom in India, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls on political parties fielding candidates in the general elections beginning April 19 to commit to ten concrete measures that aim to defend the right to reliable news and information and protect journalists. The persecution of journalists and media has intensified dramatically since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014 and India is now ranked as low as 161st out of 180 countries in RSF’s 2023 [World Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/index). At least [28 journalists](https://rsf.org/en/barometer) have been killed since 2014 and nine are [currently imprisoned](https://rsf.org/en/aasif-sultans-re-arrest-highlights-india-s-systematic-use-terrorism-laws-persecute-kashmiri). Terrorism laws are being misused to persecute media personnel. The police and tax agencies are constantly deployed to silence independent media. Journalists are routinely subjected to the scourge of disinformation campaigns, while access to India is getting increasingly restricted for foreign journalists. In order to put the right to information on the agenda at these general elections, RSF has identified ten key measures for candidates to adopt as a matter of urgency. “It is unacceptable that the country portrayed as the world’s biggest democracy now lacks so many of the safeguards needed to sustain a free and diverse press. It is unacceptable that Indian journalists and foreign reporters are subjected to so much obstruction in their day-to-day work. There is an urgent need for political parties to affirm their commitment to safeguarding the public’s right to reliable, diverse and independent information, and to adopting measures to end the continuous erosion of press freedom seen in India during the past decade. We offer them ten key measures to include in their programmes.” Célia Mercier, Head of RSF’s South Asia Desk RSF asks India’s political parties to commit to press freedom by adopting the following ten key recommendations : 1) Immediately free the nine arbitrarily detained journalists, including five from the northern Jammu and Kashmir region 2) Overhaul the terrorism laws so that they can no longer be used to persecute journalists The Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act 2019 (UAPA) and the Public Safety Act (PSA) are [often used](https://rsf.org/en/newsclick-case-india-rsf-and-guernica-37-chambers-call-european-union-sanction-delhi-police) against journalists. 3) End the censorship and surveillance of journalists New [legislation](https://thewire.in/government/telecom-broadcasting-data-protection-bill-digipub) allows, or will allow, the censorship of publications, surveillance of journalists and violation of the confidentiality of their sources. This is the case with the [Telecom Bill](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/india-must-withdraw-the-telecommunications-bill-2023/), 2023, the [Broadcasting](https://thewire.in/media/gateway-to-censorship-journalist-bodies-express-concern-over-proposed-broadcasting-services-bill) Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, the Information Technology [Amendment](https://rsf.org/en/modi-visits-washington-dc-indian-government-preparing-censor-internet) Rules, 2023 and the Digital Personal [Data Protection](https://scroll.in/article/1054094/a-censorship-tool-in-disguise-how-the-data-protection-bill-will-hurt-journalists) Act, 2023. This legislation must be amended so that it cannot be used to obstruct journalists’ work. 4) Establish an independent commission of enquiry into cases of spying on journalists At least 15 Indian journalists have been [targeted](https://thewire.in/rights/apple-india-state-sponsored-spyware) by the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware since [2021](https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-project-impacts-map/) with complete impunity. 5) Protect the confidentiality of journalists’ sources The [seizure](https://thewire.in/law/proper-guidelines-seizure-of-digital-devices-journalists-supreme-court) of journalistic equipment must be limited to strictly defined exceptional circumstances and subject to the control of an independent judicial authority. This is essential in order to safeguard the confidentiality of journalists’ sources, which are currently not protected because journalists’ equipment can be [seized](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-480-electronic-devices-seized-in-newsclick-probe-forensically-tested-cops-101707331588618.html) without restriction. 6) Safeguard pluralism by regulating media [concentration](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3253214/how-pro-modi-billionaires-are-reshaping-indias-media-landscape-1-outlet-time-journalism-dead) A small number of private-sector companies and conglomerates currently own India’s leading [media](https://rsf.org/en/ndtv-takeover-signals-end-pluralism-india-s-leading-media) outlets. Legislation must be introduced to end these monopolies and restrict cross-ownership in order to safeguard pluralism. 7) Adopt mechanisms for protecting journalists A mechanism must be established for guaranteeing the physical and digital safety of journalists, especially those who say they are being threatened, as was the case with [Nikhil Wagle](https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/its-as-if-they-wanted-to-kill-us-how-the-attacks-on-journalist-nikhil-wagle-unfolded), a freelance journalist who was recently attacked in the western state of Maharashtra, and [Nesaprabhu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tiruppur-news-7-tamil-tv-journalist-nesaprabhu-hacked-after-police-fail-to-respond-to-pleas-for-help/article67775289.ece), a News7 reporter who was attacked by a gang armed with knives and machetes in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in January. Measures must also be taken to combat the online [harassment](https://rsf.org/fr/rsf-appelle-lonu-%C3%A0-prendre-des-mesures-imm%C3%A9diates-contre-lescalade-des-menaces-et-du-harc%C3%A8lement) of journalists and media, which is now widespread. 8) Put a stop to arbitrary Internet shutdowns India leads the world in arbitrary [cuts to Internet access](https://internetshutdowns.in/). In 2023, the authorities shut down the Internet for a total of 5,000 hours in the northeastern state of Manipur alone. These shutdowns, which [violate international law](https://www.barandbench.com/columns/the-issue-of-frequent-internet-suspensions-accessing-the-laws-and-regulations-related-to-it), obstruct journalists’ work and encourage the spread of fake news and disinformation, especially during elections. 9) End the restrictions on [access](https://scroll.in/article/936259/foreign-journalist-sent-back-from-assam-government-cites-visa-rule-to-restrict-access-to-north-east) to certain parts of the country In February, reporters were denied access to [Haldwani](https://twitter.com/sighyush/status/1756995373476782453?s=20), a locality in the northern state of Uttarakhand. Foreign journalists have to obtain special permits to visit 10 of India’s 36 states and territories. [Jammu and Kashmir](https://rsf.org/en/aasif-sultans-re-arrest-highlights-india-s-systematic-use-terrorism-laws-persecute-kashmiri), in particular, is almost totally inaccessible for them. 10) Safeguard the foreign media’s right to cover India India has stepped up reprisals against foreign journalists, above all by giving them shorter visas or denying them work permits. French journalist Vanessa Dougnac is a prime example of the difficulties for [foreign reporters](https://rsf.org/en/foreign-correspondents-increasingly-refused-permits-visas-access-india) trying to cover India. After being based in India covering the country for more than 20 years, she was finally [forced to leave](https://rsf.org/en/delhi-based-french-reporter-forced-leave-india-sign-growing-crackdown-press-freedom) in February.",

    "text": "Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "text": "Illustrative photo (Photo: Getty Images)\nThe Russian Federation is preparing another powerful information-psychological campaign. It will be using the theme of presidential elections, according to the press service of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\nIn mid-December 2023, a meeting of the so-called Institute of CIS Countries took place in Moscow. The institute, in turn, is under the control of the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and is financed from the budget of the terrorist country. The topic of the gathering was the war against Ukraine.\nDuring the discussion, experts concluded that Ukrainian military command supposedly shifted to a positional defense with the aim of:\ndisrupting the Russian advance in winter and spring of 2024; strengthening defensive lines; enhancing the air defense system; accumulating ammunition; forming a combat-ready reserve.\nRussian experts are convinced that this scenario will prevent further occupation of Ukraine by forceful means.\n“As a result, in Kremlin circles, emphasis was placed on the inadmissibility of any cessation of hostilities, Ukraine retaining access to the Black Sea, and the existence of a ‘pro-Western regime’ in Kyiv,” wrote the Ukrainian military intelligence.\nDuring the meeting, calls for another psychological campaign against the top military-political leadership of Ukraine regarding the presidential elections were echoed.\n“The goal of the campaign is to undermine the legitimacy of the President of Ukraine and the leadership of our state among countries that supposedly are allies and partners of Russia, and – if successful – among Ukrainian citizens,” explained the intelligence.\nPresidential elections in Ukraine\nPresidential elections in Ukraine were scheduled for late March 2024, but due to martial law, their conduct is prohibited by law.\nAs early as August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admitted that the government could change legislation on this issue, but only if the U.S. and Europe agreed to meet several conditions.\nAt the same time, the advisor to the head of the Presidential Office, Mykhailo Podolyak, explained the reasons why holding elections in Ukraine was impossible.",

El crimen del hincha albo sigue trayendo coletazos para Colo Colo. Esta vez, el presidente del club Universitario de Lima, rival del “Cacique” en el amistoso de este miércoles, hizo sus descargos contra Aníbal Mosa y la dirigencia alba. En conversación con La Tercera, el timonel del cuadro “Crema”, Jean Ferrari, anunció que enviarán un documento al ente rector del fútbol sudamericano. “Nosotros vamos a mandar un documento a Conmebol. Es lo que corresponde. Hemos estado expuestos a lo que la hinchada de Colo Colo hizo, con el riesgo que implica. Haremos algo por escrito. Lo que haga la Conmebol ya depende de ellos“, señaló. Luego, lanzó una tajante acusación a la dirigencia alba: “La dirigencia de Colo Colo no se comportó a la altura. Me comuniqué con Aníbal Mosa, pero en ningún momento hemos sentido apoyo ni presencia, como debió ser en todo momento. Prefiero, en realidad, dejarlo ahí“. Presidente de Universitario acusó a Aníbal Mosa y anuncia problemas para Colo Colo En la misma entrevista, Jean Ferrari advirtió que este incidente traerá mayores problemas para los albos: “Esto les va a traer más problemas. Ha pasado en la Copa Libertadores, también. A nivel local, acaban de reabrir un sector del estadio que les fue clausurado por problemas con los mismos hinchas”. “Fue lamentable el comportamiento de los hinchas de Colo Colo. Eso es lo que lamentamos. Nosotros vinimos a hacer un partido amistoso, de práctica y nos encontramos con hinchas que hicieron todo lo contrario a un partido de la naturaleza del que veníamos a disputar. Hubo un mal accionar de la seguridad privada. Nos vamos mortificados”, cerró. ¿Cuándo será el próximo partido de los albos? Luego de este encuentro amistoso que debió ser suspendido por estos graves incidentes, el “Cacique” volverá a ver acción este domingo 30 de junio. Dicho encuentro por Copa Chile se desarrollará también en el Estadio Monumental desde las 17:30 horas, y el rival será O’Higgins de Racangua. Lectura recomendada:",
