    "text": "Adesso è ufficiale: Alvaro [Morata](/t/morata) è un giocatore del [Milan](/t/milan). L’attaccante arriva dall’Atletico Madrid (è stata pagata la clausola rescissoria di 13 milioni di euro) e ha firmato un contratto di quattro anni con opzione per la quinta stagione a cinque milioni di euro all’anno. In questo momento è in vacanza dopo la finale di Euro 2024 vinta, da capitano, con la Spagna (2-1 a Berlino contro l’Inghilterra). Si aggregherà alla squadra di Paulo Fonseca ad agosto, pronto per il debutto il 13 di quel mese nel trofeo Silvio Berlusconi contro il Monza. «AC Milan è lieto di comunicare di aver acquisito a titolo definitivo le prestazioni sportive del calciatore Alvaro Borja Morata Martin dall’Atltico de Madrid. Capitano della Nazionale spagnola, con cui si è appena laureato Campione d’Europa, Morata ha firmato un contratto con il club rossonero fino al 30 giugno 2028 con opzione per un altro anno», si legge sul comunicato. Indosserà la maglia numero 7 ceduta «con grande generosità» da Adli (che avrà la 94). Ora il club di via Aldo Rossi punta tutto su Füllkrug del Borussia Dortmund. Costa 15 milioni e a lui il Milan vuole dare la casacca numero 9 lasciata libera da Giroud. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "Hobart Hurricanes opener Ben McDermott has lodged a ball in the roof at Marvel Stadium with a massive strike in the BBL clash against the Melbourne Renegades.\nMcDermott catapulted a loose delivery from Tom Rogers so high over mid-wicket that the ball became stuck among the rafters of the closed roof, rather than falling back to ground on Thursday night.\nThe umpire signalled a six for the lofty strike, although batters are no longer automatically awarded maximum runs for hitting the roof under changes to Cricket Australia's playing conditions this season.\nMcDermott's rocket shot had to be adjudged to be on its way over the boundary for the umpire to award six runs.\nThe Renegades had earlier overcome a slow start to compile a competitive 4-147 as Jordan Cox led the recovery.\nThe Renegades had crawled to only 56 runs from their opening 12 overs until Cox kickstarted their innings with a huge six in the power surge.\nThe hard-hitting England batter was the main aggressor in a critical 66-run stand with Jonathan Wells for the fourth wicket, until lofting a quicker ball from Riley Meredith (1-34) to Chris Jordan at mid-on.\nWells (38 not out) put his foot down from there to steer the under-fire Renegades to a total they will hope to defend against a side that tends to struggle on the road.\nThe Hurricanes had the hosts on the ropes from the opening over when Tim David dismissed Shaun Marsh caught behind for a duck to complete a wicket maiden.\nSouth Africa star Quinton de Kock (20) looked set to reignite the Gades' innings in his final BBL match this season, until giving up his wicket with a timid slice to deep point.\nRising star Jake Fraser-McGurk (26) was next to make a solid start, but after smacking a powerful boundary he was out next ball after picking out Jordan at long on.\nHobart left-arm spinner Patrick Dooley (0-16) was a key to restricting the Renegades' top order, delivering 15 dot balls in four tight overs.\nDavid was not called on to bowl a second over, despite claiming one scalp without giving up a run to start the match.\nThe Gades entered the clash without captain Nic Maddinson, with Will Sutherland instead taking the reins.\nFormer Australian one-ball skipper Aaron Finch was also left out of the XI.\nFinch revealed before the match that this season will be his last in the BBL, as the second-highest run-scorer in the history of the competition winds down his career.\nThe Hurricanes are four points behind the Sydney Sixers (third) and the Melbourne Stars (fourth), but had two matches in hand ahead of their clash with the Renegades, as they look to keep pace with the top four.\n ",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "3 ways long-term care insurance can benefit dementia patients - CBS News",
    "text": "One thing that's important to consider as you create your retirement plan is the increased cost of healthcare you may face as you age. Once you turn 65, you have a high chance of needing long-term care at some point in your remaining years — and that care can be expensive .\nThat's especially true if you develop dementia. As of February 2023, the average cost of living in a memory care home was $6,160 per month, according to Dementia Care Central , an educational resource funded by the National Institute on Aging. That amounts to about $73,920 in memory care expenses each year.\nThe good news is that you don't have to cover that bill on your own. Long-term care insurance can help you cover the cost of dementia care, should you develop the condition.\nGet long-term care insurance to make sure you can afford the care you need .\n3 ways long-term care insurance can benefit dementia patients \"Getting long-term care insurance could be a life-changer if dementia or any memory care is required for a family member,\" says Brandon Robinson, president and founder of JBR Associates in Plano, Texas. \"For dementia patients, needing memory care can be very expensive since that patient would need full-time care with a health care professional.\"\nThe good news is that long-term care insurance may be able to help . Here's how:\nIt can pay for memory care housing As mentioned above, memory care communities can be expensive — and that expense is only likely to continue growing.\nFortunately, a long-term care insurance policy can help cover this cost in a couple of ways:\nIt could cover your care completely : You may decide to purchase a long-term care insurance policy that's large enough to cover your care completely. In this case, your insurance would simply pay the bills for your assisted living memory care. It could be supplemental coverage for those expenses : You likely have other retirement income, like Social Security income and potential pensions, a 401k or other retirement savings. If that's the case, you can use this income to cover some of your memory care costs and use long-term care insurance to pay for your remaining expenses. As such, you'll need less coverage, reducing your monthly insurance premiums. Look into how long-term care insurance can help you cover the growing cost of memory care .\nIt can pay for adult daycare You may have a family member or two who are willing to provide your care if you develop dementia. However, there may be a need for adult daycare. For example, what if your family caregiver works a typical eight-hour per day, five-day per week work schedule? In this instance, adult daycare would come in handy.\nBut the cost of adult daycare services can be relatively high, averaging anywhere from $38 to $148 per day, depending on where you live, according to Dementia Care Central. Long-term care insurance typically covers this cost.\nIt can pay family caregivers In some cases, your long-term care insurance can even provide your family caregivers with a source of income . However, it's important that if you're going to lean on family caregivers, you make sure your long-term care insurance policy offers coverage for informal care providers.\nLong-term care insurance covers other costs, too Long-term care insurance isn't only helpful if you develop memory care needs. It can also help cover a wide range of costs as you age. For example:\nAssisted living or nursing homes : Long-term care insurance can cover the cost of assisted living communities or nursing homes if you need regular assistance with day-to-day tasks. Aging in place : This type of insurance also provides several benefits for those who plan on aging in place . As noted, long-term care insurance can help cover adult daycare and provide a paycheck to family caregivers. Home renovations : Long-term care insurance may also cover the cost of home renovations to ensure that your home is accessible to you through your golden years. For example, your provider may pay for the installation of a ramp, handrails or a traction control device to make sure you can safely access your home. Get long-term care insurance now to ensure you have options as you age .\nThe bottom line \"It's imperative that you secure the LTC insurance before the diagnosis of memory loss. With LTC insurance, you can have the majority, or all, of the monthly costs covered,\" says Robinson. Moreover, this type of coverage can help with a wide range of age-related healthcare cost increases — but only if you purchase coverage before you need it. Compare your long-term care insurance options now to make sure you're covered .\nJoshua Rodriguez Joshua Rodriguez is a personal finance and investing writer with a passion for his craft.

    "text": "The NCAA is on some real clown ish for this.\nThe 2025 edition of March Madness began Tuesday evening with two “First Four” contests being played to determine who officially gets into the big dance. During the games, fans were treated to … if you ask me … some outright comedy.\nWith sports betting becoming the new norm, it’s not just the teams in the NCAA tournament that will be dealing with high stakes, so will millions of Americans when they slap bets on the action. (RELATED: First Game Of March Madness Ends With Unbelievable Hail Mary Game-Winner)\nWith this being the case, the NCAA hilariously felt the need to launch a sports betting commercial Tuesday that basically blasts people who harass student-athletes over lost bets as blatant losers. They actually used that word, which makes this whole thing even more funny.\nIn fact, the advertisement is called “Don’t Be a Loser,” and just … check this thing out.\nWATCH:\n‘Don’t Be a Loser’: @NCAA launches sports betting anti-harassment video.\n🔗 https://t.co/P90rwvCcCj pic.twitter.com/tZLBfWzUbm\n— NCAA News (@NCAA_PR) March 18, 2025\nIt’s comical to me that the NCAA actually felt the need to do this, and how they did it just makes it even better. But while I’m at it, it’ll prove to be completely ineffective.\nAs long as sports betting is involved that gives people the ability to be emotionally connected to their wallet in a sporting event, there will always be angry fans that harass players. They gotta hit those parlays!\nI get what the NCAA is trying to do, but it won’t work. Thanks for the comedy, though.",

    "title": "Promoting Healthy Weight Management Among Employees",
    "text": "In today's fast-paced corporate world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can often take a backseat to work-related pressures and deadlines. As a result, unhealthy weight gain has become a prevalent issue among employees in various industries. Promoting healthy weight management among employees is not just about aesthetics; it's about improving overall well-being, increasing productivity, and reducing healthcare costs. In this article, we will explore effective strategies for promoting healthy weight management among employees without referencing specific companies but focusing on educating readers on the topic and providing guidance on what to look for when seeking the best solutions.\nThe Impact of Employee Weight Management on Business\nMaintaining a healthy weight is not only crucial for individual health but also for a company's bottom line. Employees struggling with obesity or unhealthy weight gain can experience a range of negative consequences that ultimately affect the organization as a whole. These consequences include:\n- Decreased Productivity: Obesity and related health issues can lead to decreased productivity, as employees may experience fatigue, reduced concentration, and more frequent sick days. Moreover, overweight employees may be less confident in their abilities, further affecting their work performance.\n- Increased Healthcare Costs: Employers often bear the brunt of increased healthcare costs due to employees' weight-related medical issues. This includes expenses related to chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and joint problems. Addressing weight management can significantly reduce these expenses in the long run.\n- Higher Absenteeism: Employees with unhealthy weight management habits may take more sick leave or disability days, leading to disruptions in workflow and decreased team cohesion. These absences can affect project timelines and overall team morale.\n- Decreased Morale: A workplace that doesn't prioritize employee well-being may suffer from decreased morale and engagement among staff. When employees feel their health is not valued, they may become disengaged and less committed to their roles.\n- Talent Retention Challenges: Companies that don't offer wellness initiatives may struggle to attract and retain top talent who seek organizations that prioritize employee health. A lack of weight management programs could deter prospective employees from joining your organization.\nEffective Strategies for Promoting Healthy Weight Management\nPromoting healthy weight management among employees involves a multifaceted approach that encompasses both physical and mental well-being. Here are some strategies that organizations can consider:\n- Employee Education: Start by educating employees about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and the risks associated with obesity. Promote awareness through workshops, seminars, and newsletters. Share information about nutrition, physical activity, and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.\n- Nutritional Support: Offer healthy eating options in the workplace, such as nutritious snacks, access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and guidance on portion control. Encourage employees to make healthier food choices by providing nutritional information and healthy recipes.\n- Physical Activity Initiatives: Provide opportunities for physical activity during work hours, such as yoga or fitness classes, standing desks, and walking meetings. Promote the use of stairs instead of elevators. Additionally, consider offering gym memberships or fitness incentives.\n- Stress Management Programs: High stress levels can contribute to unhealthy weight gain. Implement stress management programs, including mindfulness sessions and mental health resources, to help employees cope effectively. Promote work-life balance to reduce stressors.\n- Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs): EAPs can provide employees with access to counseling and support for issues related to weight management, stress, and mental health. Ensure that employees know how to access these resources and that they are confidential.\n- Incentive Programs: Consider incentivizing employees to participate in wellness initiatives. Rewards for reaching fitness goals or maintaining a healthy weight can be motivating. These incentives can include gift cards, extra vacation days, or even financial bonuses.\n- Health Screenings: Offer regular health screenings to identify early signs of weight-related health issues and provide personalized guidance based on results. Screenings can include BMI assessments, blood pressure checks, and cholesterol testing.\n- Supportive Workplace Culture: Foster a culture that values work-life balance and encourages employees to take breaks, prioritize their health, and seek help when needed. Promote inclusivity and respect for all employees, regardless of their body size.\n- Leadership Involvement: Encourage leaders and executives to lead by example and actively participate in wellness programs. Their involvement can inspire employees to follow suit. Leaders can share their own wellness journeys to create a sense of unity and motivation.\n- Wellness Challenges: Organize friendly wellness challenges, such as step competitions or weight loss challenges, to promote camaraderie and healthy competition among employees. These challenges can create a sense of community and support.\nPromoting healthy weight management among employees is not only a moral responsibility but also a strategic move for any organization. A healthier workforce translates to increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs, and a more engaged team.\nIf your organization is looking for guidance on implementing effective wellness initiatives or needs assistance in creating a healthier workplace culture, consider partnering with wellness consulting experts like Global Healthcare Resources.
