    "text": "Chandigarh: Amid the Punjab government’s efforts to promote the direct seeded rice (DSR), the state has witnessed a 15 per cent increase in the area on which paddy has been sown using this technique as compared to last year. The ongoing paddy sowing season is midway. Over 2 lakh acres of the area has already been sown using the DSR system, which was 1.72 lakh acres in the whole kharif season last year. Punjab agriculture and farmers welfare minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian, while terming it a great success, hoped to accomplish 5 lakh acres under the DSR this season, as targeted by the agriculture department. He further said that chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann-led Punjab government has been providing ₹1,500 as financial assistance to encourage the farmers to adopt DSR technique. The department has allocated ₹50 crore to provide to farmers opting this technique during 2024-25 whereas it was ₹20.33 crore last fiscal when 17,116 farmers had got the assistance, the minister informed while urging the farmers to join hands with the state government to save the groundwater. He said farmers, who have opted for the DSR, need to register on the government portal (agrimachinerypb.com) till July 15, 2024 to get assistance. Under the DSR, rice seeds are directly planted in the fields instead of the traditional method of growing seedlings in nurseries and then transplanting them into the fields.",

    "title": "AI Workforce Biased? Shocking Report Shows Women’s Skills Going Unrecognized",
    "text": "According to a new report by Randstad , a global recruiting and talent company, 71% of AI workers are men while only 29% are women. This was concluded after analyzing 3 million job profiles and 12,000 responses from employed participants. This shows that there is a huge gender gap when it comes to the AI workforce. The report also stated that women are less prioritized to access AI in their companies (35%) as compared to men (41%). Women are also 5% less likely to be prioritized over men for an AI related job. Only 30% of women are confident in their AI skills as compared to 35% men.\nJulia McCoy, founder of First Movers, says that this is a very critical situation because it isn’t all about gender gap now. It is also concerning because there will be a lot of problems in future if we exclude women for job opportunities now. As AI will be pretty much everywhere in the coming years, we are ignoring real human potential which will affect many industries in the long run. This just shows that AI isn’t only threatening workplace inequalities, it is increasing the gender gap too.\nTo fix this gender gap due to AI skills, experts say that companies need to invest in upskilling their female employees. Educational institutions should also play their part in integrating AI literacy into their curriculums. There should also be visible female leaders in AI. Society also needs to change its perspectives about STEM being a male dominated field.\nInstitutions should also change the mindset about AI being a “future of work” instead of “a tech thing”. One positive aspect of the report was that there was a narrow AI digital gap among women who have been in the workforce for less than a year, as compared to women who have been working for many years.\nRead next: A New Survey Finds Executives and Employees Think About AI Implementation Differently",

    "title": "7 Chicken Soups That Will Soothe Your Soul in Westchester",
    "text": "There’s nothing like a steaming bowl of chicken soup when you’re under the weather, or when the weather has you chilled to the bone. Lovingly called “Jewish penicillin,” and with a bestselling series of books bearing its name, chicken soup is a must when you’re sick — and it’s a warming, deeply satisfying meal on days in between. Researchers say it really does helps reduce upper-respiratory inflammation (though, they’re not sure why), meaning your mother and her mother were right about why you need it. Here are a few of our favorite healthy and slurp-worthy chicken soups in Westchester.\nView this post on Instagram\nCaldo de Pollo at\nLa Casa Bronxville\n7 Pondfield Rd, Bronxville; 914.222.9016\nSimple and satisfying, the traditional Mexican chicken soup served at this sophisticated village hotspot sways rustic and soul-soothing, as if prepared by a culinary-schooled abuela with a need to feed instead of a Puebla-raised chef with a Michelin star on his CV. Fresh carrots, cabbage, corn, chayote, and garbanzo beans bob about the earthy broth, leaving the slurper satisfied but longing for more.\nView this post on Instagram\nFeel Better Chicken Soup at\nLadle of Love\n18 Palmer Ave, Bronxville; 914.346.8883\nThose in the know pocket the co-pay and head straight to this bastion of small-batch cooking for a hearty bowl of this feel-good soother. Characterized by a generous dousing of fresh lemon, it’s born from a stock of thoughtfully sourced chicken parts that are gently simmered with herbs and classic mirepoix (onions, celery, carrots) for three-plus hours. “It has that curative punch of lemon for when you’re not feeling well and notes of lemongrass and cilantro in the flavor profile,” says chef and owner Leslie Lampert. “We can’t keep it in stock,” she says, “pun intended.” Noodles and oodles of poached and shredded white meat are added to the mix so that there’s enough to fill every spoonful.\nAlso on Ladle’s daily menu: traditional chicken soup (with GF noodles on request), collagen-boosting bone broth, and chicken-dumpling soup, which is best described as a pot pie in liquid form (read that last one again and call us in the morning).\nView this post on Instagram\nChicken Tortilla Soup at\nbartaco\n1 Willet Ave, Port Chester; 914.937.8226\nWith a zing and zip like no other, the house-made rustic chicken tortilla soup at this eclectic waterside taco joint (that boasts a heated patio aside the gently rippling Byram River) is a tasty take on a classic. It features roasted poblano peppers and corn, and comes topped with Oaxaca cheese and house-made tortilla strips. Already packed with bold flavors, a squeeze of lime adds extra tang.\nChicken Garlic Soup at\nJewel of Himalaya\n751 Central Park Ave, Scarsdale; 914.874.5506\n34 Triangle Ctr, Yorktown Heights; 914.302.2886\nNot a one-pot meal, the standout soup at this family-owned and -operated den of homestyle cuisine from Nepal, Tibet, and India begins with bone-in chicken ever so slowly bubbling on one burner, while crushed ginger, garlic, and water boil on another. Once cooked, the chicken is pulled from the bone and added to the garlic-ginger solution. From there, turmeric, salt, and timur, a Nepalese Szechuan pepper, go in along with chopped potatoes, carrots, and grilled celery.\nGrandma’s Chicken Soup at\nThe Kneaded Bread\n181 N Main St, Port Chester; 914.937.9489\nChef and owner Jeff Kohn grew up on his Austrian Jewish grandmother’s chicken soup — and you can too! Working off knowledge and know-how coursing through his DNA, Kohn creates fresh stock from neck and back meat that’s simmered with the whole bird and fresh ginger. White meat is pulled from the bone and stirred into the pot. Then come the veggies. “I’m a parsnips guy,” says Kohn, who adds the nourishing root to the soup, along with diced carrots and leeks, yielding “all the right aromatics.” A generous serving of fresh dill is added in, “bringing it to the next level and taking me back home,” says Kohn, who tries to make enough to serve hot and also stock in the grab-and-go freezer.\nAvgolemono at\nLefteris Gyro\n149 S Central Park Ave, Hartsdale; 914.437.5200\n190 E Main St, Mount Kisco; 914.242.8965\n501 Marble Ave, Pleasantville; 914.579.2274\n1 N Broadway, Tarrytown; 914.524.9687\nLegend has it that when life gives them lemons, Greek grandmas make avgolemono! This rich and fragrant soup starts out as a silky sauce of egg yolks, chicken broth, and a whole lotta lemons. The concoction simmers delicately until thickened, at which time chunks of chicken and rice are added. Warm pita slices on the side are a meal-making must.\nMoroccan Chicken Soup at\nMartine’s Fine Bake Shoppe\n10 Fisher Ave, Tuckahoe; 914.346.8650\n48 E Pkwy, Scarsdale; 914.722.4949\nThis rich, savory sensation doesn’t grace the menu every day, but when it does, regulars get a heads up via text. It’s born from fresh chicken stock and spices imported from “a woman in Tel Aviv whose life is devoted to knowing everything about spices and herbs,” says chef and owner Tal Campana. Fresh baby spinach, carrots, butternut squash, and chickpeas add substance, along with white and dark meat chicken and house-grated turmeric. (When it sells out, scoop up the chicken-yucca soup ASAP.)",

    "text": "【新唐人北京时间2025年07月03日讯】加州洛杉矶近郊1月遭野火肆虐，旧金山纪事报调查污染检测结果发现，数十户民宅罕见出现致癌物质“ 铍 ”。这是首次在野火过后，铍在民宅中多处被发现。专家忧心，911事件几年后数千人罹患重症的情况重演。\n“ 铍 ”（beryllium）是一种鲜为人知的稀有金属，因比铝轻、比钢坚硬而受到青睐。由于耐腐蚀，且在极端高温或低温下依然能保持形状，在商业上被广泛应用，常以微量与铜合金的形式，应用于老式高尔夫球杆、汽车安全气囊感测器，及韦伯太空望远镜的镜面中。其在核武上的应用价值，也被美国国防部视为极为关键的战略资源。\n洛杉矶1月遭到野火肆虐，近郊高级社区“ 太平洋断崖 ”（Pacific Palisades）与伊顿（Eaton）是两大主要火场，受灾户多数已经或即将搬回家中。\n2025年1月8日，在加州 太平洋断崖 高级社区大火经过后，一栋房屋继续燃烧。(AGUSTIN PAULLIER/AFP via Getty Images) 旧金山纪事报（San Francisco Chronicle）在一项调查报导揭露，铍在火场的数十户住宅中被发现。10多位不同领域专家指出，这是首次野火过后，在多户住宅中广泛检出铍。\n尽管铍被广泛且安全地应用于各种产品之中，但当含有铍的物体被加热时，可能会释放出微小的金属粒子，进入肺部。专家指出，这种物质极为危险，即使空气中仅有微量，长期暴露也可能促使癌细胞生成，或引发终生难愈且潜在致命的呼吸道疾病。\n报导指出，大多数幸存民宅至今都没有接受铍检测，检测呈现出阳性结果的住家，几乎都是屋主自掏腰包，花费数千美元进行检测，恐有更多住宅遭到这种物质污染。\n屋主柯普兰（Krista Copelan）受访表示，在野火过后的几个月里，家中检测到各种有毒残留物；源自防腐木材和土壤中农药的砷、来自成千上万栋被烧毁房子电线系统里的铜、及来自过去的老旧油漆和含铅汽油的铅，而在厨房地板上则意外出现了铍。\n另一名屋主的检测结果则显示，家中地板每100平方公分含有1.1微克的铍，这个数值超过美国能源部（U.S. Department of Energy）建议的工业设备污染标准5倍以上，已远超安全标准。\n2025年1月7日，在加州洛杉矶的“太平洋断崖”豪宅区，人们在日落大道（Sunset Boulevard）上驾驶汽车，从Palisades大火中撤离。(Apu Gomes/Getty Images) 加州大学戴维斯分校（UC Davis）空气品质研究中心助理研究员拜恩（Keith Bein）指出，铍的发现令他震惊，“甚至无法提出一个合理假设，解释它是从哪里来的”。\n研究铍对人体影响长达40年的肺部病理专家纽曼（Lee Newman）表示，民众暴露于铍的程度和风险大小，取决于这些受污染的物体表面从现在开始如何被处理。\n部分专家指出，清除铍可以采用目前用于清除铅的标准方法，需要穿戴防护装备、使用专业器材，并进行彻底的重复检测。但相较于铅，铍在极低浓度下就具有毒性。\n纽曼也指出，铍在固态状态下，无论是纯金属或合金形式，对人体是无害的；但一旦受到干扰，比如把它研磨、抛光、打磨或熔化，这些动作都可能产生铍的烟雾，也就是金属微粒或铍粉尘。铍微粒体积极小，极容易悬浮在空气中，并被吸入人体内。\n纽曼补充，高浓度铍若接触到伤口可能造成溃疡，若进入眼睛则可能引起慢性结膜炎。国际癌症研究机构（IARC）已将铍列为致癌物，表示其与癌症有关联性。\n不过，最令专家担忧的是呼吸系统方面的疾病。加州大学旧金山分校（UCSF）前教授巴麦斯（John Balmes）表示，当铍微粒进入肺部时，可能会在某些人身上引发一种叫做“铍致敏”（beryllium sensitization）的免疫系统反应，有可能更进一步发展成为“慢性肺部疾病”，最终可能导致长期咳嗽、呼吸困难、疲劳与肺功能下降。\n医师则强调，暴露在铍中并不会立即造成健康影响，但其可能引发的严重甚至致命疾病，往往在多年后才会浮现。\n2001年，美国遭遇911恐怖攻击，纽约消防人员与清理人员暴露在世贸大楼余烬与残骸释出的各种有毒物质中。几年之后，数千人罹患重病，包括癌症、呼吸与消化系统疾病。\n熟悉铍暴露标准的美国能源部前工业卫生专家温巴赫（Paul Wambach）告诉旧金山纪事报，“在我看来，最关键的问题是：我们是不是又遇上了类似911救援人员的情况”。\n（转自中央社/责任编辑：卢勇信）",

    "text": "Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi, , was quickly expelled from France to Tunisia after being accused of holding “anti-France” speeches during his sermons on February 2, 9 and 16. The Minister of the Interior, Gérald Darmanin, declared this decision on X. Mahjoubi had described the “tricolour flag” as “satanic” in a sermon broadcast on social networks. An expulsion decree was issued against him after the broadcast of a short extract where he denigrated the French flag. Mahjoub Mahjoubi is accused of having “conveyed a literal, retrograde, intolerant and violent conception of Islam”, according to the ministerial expulsion order. Authorities found other problematic statements from the imam, some praising jihad and demeaning women. This expulsion takes place in the context of the fight against religious extremism in France.

    "title": "Esta es la única piscina de Madrid en la que podrás bañarte de madrugada: con cena y música en directo",
    "text": "En las calurosas noches de verano, cuando el asfalto de la ciudad aún emana todo el calor acumulado durante el día, encontrar un refugio fresco y ameno se convierte en una prioridad para los madrileños.\nEste sábado, una propuesta única promete transformar una habitual noche de verano en una experiencia divertida y sobre todo refrescante, combinando el placer del agua con la magia de la música en directo . La iniciativa, impulsada por el Ayuntamiento de Humanes, busca ofrecer una alternativa refrescante y cultural para los ciudadanos.\nEl ambiente nocturno, generalmente dominado por el bullicio de los bares y terrazas, encontrará un nuevo protagonista. Desde las 21.00 hasta las 02.00 horas , una piscina ubicada en el sur de la región abrirá las puertas este fin de semana para recibir a quienes deseen sumergirse en un baño bajo las estrellas , mientras el dúo Azahar ameniza la velada con su música en directo empezando ya desde el mediodía.\n[El pueblo a una hora de Madrid que arrasa por su piscina natural: parking gratis y vistas espectaculares] Este evento, que se repetirá todos los sábados del mes de julio , es una oportunidad para disfrutar de las noches de una manera diferente. No se trata solo de nadar, sino de dejarse llevar por el ritmo de la música y flotar mientras el cuerpo se va animando. La música, el agua, la brisa nocturna y la luz de la luna crearán una atmósfera mágica.\nAhora bien, ¿dónde se encuentra este oasis nocturno? Como hemos adelantado se trata de la piscina municipal de Humanes que un año más ha apostado por esta idea tan original.\nNormalmente, las instalaciones cierran sus puertas a las 20.00 horas, pero a partir de este sábado, abrirá hasta las 2.00 horas para ofrecer a los asistentes una noche diferente.\nSegún nos han confirmado, la entrada para este evento requiere el pago de una tarifa adicional , ya que se trata de un horario especial. La buena noticia es que el bar de la zona estará abierto, ofreciendo la posibilidad de cenar o tomar algo mientras se disfruta de la noche.\nLos viernes, el bar estará disponible desde las 21.00 hasta la 01.00 , creando el mejor ambiente para una cena veraniega. Los sábados el bar estará abierto a la misma hora, lo único que este día podrás no solo cenar y tomarte algo si no también darte un chapuzón.\nPero la oferta de actividades no se detiene aquí. A partir del 9 de julio, los mayores de 65 años tendrán la oportunidad de participar en clases gratuitas de aquagym . Esta actividad, organizada en colaboración con las Concejalías de Mayores y Deportes, se llevará a cabo los martes y jueves de julio , de 11.00 a 12.00 horas. Los interesados podrán acceder a la piscina a partir de las 10.30 para prepararse y aprovechar al máximo la sesión.\nLa iniciativa del baño nocturno en la piscina municipal de Humanes ha sido recibida con entusiasmo por los vecinos. En muchos municipios, este tipo de eventos se han convertido en clásicos del verano, atrayendo a un público muy diverso pero especialmente a los adolescentes, que encuentran en estas noches una forma divertida de pasar el tiempo.\nAdemás de ofrecer una alternativa de ocio, estas actividades ayudan a hacer más llevaderos los calurosos días del periodo estival. La combinación de música, agua y buena compañía permitirá a los asistentes desconectar del estrés diario y disfrutar de la temporada.",

    "text": "I leader di Hamas e della Jihad islamica palestinese hanno chiesto il ritiro completo dell'esercito israeliano dall'intera Striscia di Gaza per poter raggiungere un accordo con Tel Aviv. Dopo l'incontro con il Segretario generale del Movimento della Jihad islamica, Mohammed Darvish, il capo del Consiglio consultivo di Hamas, Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, e il suo vice, Mohammed al-Hindi, hanno rilasciato una dichiarazione congiunta e hanno annunciato che per raggiungere un accordo con Tel Aviv sono necessari il completo ritiro dell'esercito israeliano dall'intera regione della Striscia di Gaza, l'inizio della ricostruzione della regione, l'accordo sullo scambio di prigionieri e la fine dell'assedio.\nGuerra Israele - Hamas: la diretta di oggi I corpi di sei ostaggi ritrovati nei tunnel Le obiezioni di Hamas al piano di Blinken “Così si muore lentamente a Gaza” di Rita Baroud Domande e risposte sul conflitto in Medio Oriente Dossier - Sentieri di guerra\n00:25 Pelosi: “Di Gaza hanno parlato vari speaker alla convention”\n\"Non abbiamo tutte le nazionalità del Paese che parlano alla convention\". Lo ha detto Nancy Pelosi rispondendo a chi le chiedeva perché la convention non avesse concesso a un americano palestinese di salire sul palco della convention, dove è salita la famiglia di uno degli ostaggio nelle mani di Hamas. Pelosi ha precisato che diversi speaker hanno parlato di Gaza, inclusi il numero uno del United Auto Workers, Bernie Sanders e Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"Siamo molto seri sul cessate il fuoco\" a Gaza, aggiunge Pelosi.\n00:02 Colloquio Borrell-Araghchi, serve de-escalation\n\"Ho parlato con il nuovo ministro degli Esteri iraniano Aragchi delle prospettive di rinnovato impegno su tutti i dossier di reciproco interesse, inclusa la necessità di de-escalation e moderazione, l'interruzione della cooperazione militare con la Russia contro l'Ucraina e la non proliferazione nucleare.

Lo riporta il quotidiano qatariota Al-Araby Al-Jadeed , citato da Times of Israel . Secondo il piano, l'Unione Europea avrebbe una missione al valico di Rafah insieme all'Autorità Nazionale Palestinese e le truppe dell'Iff si ritireranno gradualmente dal confine.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",

    "title": "Qatar’s Samba finishes second in Zurich - Gulf Times",
    "text": "Qatar’s Abderrahman Samba finished second in 400m hurdles at the Zurich Diamond League on Thursday. Roshawn Clarke won the event as the Jamaican clocked a season’s best of 47.49 seconds. Samba, who finished sixth at the Paris Olympics, also registered his season’s best time of 47.58 secs. Rasmus Magi of Estonia was third in 48.02 secs. Olympics silver medallist and world record holder Karsten Warholm of Norway did not start due to a hamstring injury, while Alison dos Santos of Brazil did not finish the race. The Olympic bronze medallist had aimed for the Diamond League trophy, but an apparent injury forced him to stop midway through the race. The conditions were not ideal as the track was wet due to heavy rain. Meanwhile Armand Duplantis admitted to feeling “wrecked” after an exhibition 100m race, while Sha’Carri Richardson and Letsile Tebogo steamed to sprint victories. So much is now expected when Duplantis takes to the runway of the pole vault, but it was for him a relatively disappointing competition in cold and rainy conditions, albeit a victory. The Swede won with a best clearance of 5.82m on countback from American Sam Kendricks. “Mentally, I felt good today, but my body felt wrecked after Thursday’s race,” he said in reference to the 100m showdown with 400m hurdles world record holder Karsten Warholm. Duplantis won the sprint in a “very impressive” 10.37sec to Warholm’s 10.47. “For both of us it was a great experience,” said Duplantis. “It was super amazing. I think we built a super event, it was very new and innovative.” While Duplantis at least picked up another win, Warholm was an absentee after pinging his hamstring after his sprint endeavours. But as the loser, Warholm was deigned to wear one of the Swede’s national tops in action on Thursday. While not competing, Warholm duly made an appearance on the track dressed in Duplantis’ kit, but said it was “terrible. I need to take a really good shower after this!” Roshawn Clarke of Jamaica, in 47.49sec, won the 400m hurdles in his absence. World champion Richardson went some way to avenging her Olympic defeat by Julien Alfred by reversing the tables in the 100m. Richardson headed into the final 20 metres in third behind Saint Lucia’s Olympic champion Julien Alfred and Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith. But the American stayed strong and focused on the line, producing a savage dip for first place in 10.84 seconds, 0.04sec ahead of Alfred. “I am training and executing because I know the race is not going to take care of itself,” said Richardson. Botswana’s Olympic champion Tebogo also left it late for his victory in the men’s 200m. The 21-year-old edged Olympic silver medallist Kenny Bednarek by 0.02sec as he won in 19.55sec. And in a re-run of the men’s 1500m Olympic final, it was American Yared Nuguse who took the spoils, outsprinting Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen to the line in 3:29.21. Beatrice Chebet, who became double Olympic champion in Paris (5,000m and 10,000m), fell short in her tilt at a world record in the shorter event. Chebet had pacemakers, wavelight technology and a 30,000 sell-out crowd baying her on, but the Kenyan finally timed 14:09.52, all the while smashing by 21sec the meet record set back in September 2011 by compatriot Vivian Jepkemei Cheruiyot. There was a fifth consecutive Diamond League victory for Ukraine’s Olympic champion and world record holder Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who managed a best of 1.96m in the high jump for victory. There were also two more dominant performances from Americans who’d struck gold in Paris. First up, three-time Olympic champion Ryan Crouser wrapped up another shot put competition with a winning 22.66m.Grant Holloway then clocked a rapid 12.99sec for victory in the 110m hurdles. Qatar’s Abderrahman Samba and Jamaica’s Roshawn Clarke compete in the 400m hurdles race during the Diamond League meeting at the Letzigrund stadium in Zurich on Thursday. (AFP)",
