    "text": "December’s Christmas gifts kept on giving into the new year for Historic Fayette Theater. On Tuesday at their office in Oak Hill, Fayette County Chamber of Commerce/New River Gorge CVB representatives presented officers from the theater group with the proceeds from a December gift-wrapping project undertaken by the business group. According to chamber official Megan Weatherford, the wrapping endeavor resulted in $323 from the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce to be donated toHistoric Fayette Theater. Chamber representatives wrapped 152 Christmas gifts prior to Christmas 2023, she said. It was the second year of the project. In 2022, funds were donated to the Humane Society, said Weatherford. Neither organization requested the funds, Weatherford said. “We knew that people were in need for different things,” she said. While offering a service to members of the community who sometimes might be too busy at Christmas time to wrap gifts for themselves, the service also offers another means of outreach between the Chamber and the local community, said Weatherford. “We were so excited when they reached out and said they’d like to make the donation for us this year,” said Cindy White, president of the HFT Board of Directors. “We have some needs that we’re working toward at the theater, a new HVAC system this summer, and we’re putting in a lot of fundraising efforts to that. “So, this donation was greatly appreciated.” White said replacing the theater’s HVAC system this year is imperative. Other planned work includes wiring, plumbing and other upgrades. Any individuals, organizations or businesses wanting to donate to the theater group to help defray operating expenses can visit [fayettetheater.com](http://fayettetheater.com) or mail checks to P.O. Box 448, Fayetteville, WV 25840. l l l Sharon Bibb, vice-president of the board of directors, also expressed her appreciation for the donation. Bibb is directing the theater’s next production, “Jack and the Giant,” which will take to the stage for three weekends of performances beginning March 8. The initial rehearsal for the production, a vocal rehearsal, occurred Jan. 2. Bibb says she’s excited about the upcoming play. “It’s just going to be a lot of family fun,” she said. “Lots of laughs, just be a good time and get away.”",

    "text": "圖、文／CTWANT\n▲印尼一名司機用Google地圖導航，被指引開向「未完工高架橋」，載著乘客從40英尺（約12公尺）高墜落，2人奇蹟生還。（圖／翻攝自X）\nGoogle地圖提供使用者清楚地標、線條或照片等詳細資訊，相當便利，讓全球民眾習慣使用。印尼近日發生一起驚悚事故，一名司機魯迪（Rudie Heru Komandono）載著乘客瓦西尼（Endang SriWahyuni）前往目的地，途中Google地圖導航他到未完工的高架橋，2人就從40英尺（約12公尺）高墜落；奇蹟的是，兩人倖存只有輕傷。\n根據外媒《太陽報》報導，當地時間9日印尼一名司機魯迪開著BMW載到一位乘客瓦西尼，他用手機使用Google地圖服務，但導航疑似出包，將魯迪導向未完工的高架橋，連人帶車墜落從40英尺（約12公尺）高度墜落。路邊監視器畫面也拍到車子墜落到車水馬龍的平面道路。\n慶幸的是，魯迪駕駛的BMW墜落平面道路時，剛好道路上沒有其他車子，沒有撞上他人，而警察和醫護人員趕抵後，對魯迪和瓦西尼進行治療，兩人奇蹟生還也僅有輕傷。魯迪事後表示，因為天色昏暗，他照著Google地圖導航開車，途中不斷一直變換道路，最後才發現被指引到未完工的高架橋。\n▲事發地點未完工的高架橋。（圖／翻攝自X）\n當地警方事後表示，未完工的高架橋上有警告標語及護欄，但魯迪剛好從護欄間隙通過，「他太專注看Google地圖，才沒有意識到自己路上有護欄和其他障礙物，結果差點出人命」；目前司機和乘客送到醫院治療後，確定沒有重傷後已經各自回家。\n除此之外，當地交通單位為了避免類似事故再次發生，已經在事發地點設置警告標示，也有對施工公司展開調查，要釐清高架橋明明未完工，卻沒有做好完善的封閉措施。\n延伸閱讀",

    "text": "ASPiRE: Empowering Future Sustainability Leaders with APRIL Group Jakarta. Sustainability has taken on a crucial role to businesses around the world. Companies are now striving to deliver more positive environmental impacts and forefronting sustainable practices. The demand for sustainability and ESG professionals are continuously increasing. [APRIL Group](https://www.aprilasia.com/en/), one of the most technologically advanced pulp and paper producer, is helping drive the sustainability agenda on a global level. The company launched the APRIL Sustainability Professional Readiness Program (ASPiRE), an accelerated, holistic program geared towards empowering post-graduates to be future leaders in ESG and sustainability. This 18-month program provides candidates access to unparalleled opportunities to take on a wide range of sustainability-related roles in APRIL, focusing on operational/technical areas. These include opportunities in conservation and restoration, community development, R&D, fiber and mill sustainability, as well as supporting corporate roles such as stakeholder engagement, communications, and ESG reporting. Throughout ASPiRE, candidates will be equipped with the knowledge to become future leaders who are able to face global issues in sustainable development. This program does not only provide exposure to the business but also fosters a unique learning experience for personal and professional growth. Every ASPiRE candidate has their own unique journey with the program. Christian Pranoto, part of ASPiRE batch 4, has a story not quite like the other. As a graduate of the University of Edinburgh’s Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, with a mission to protect Indonesian wildlife and advance his sustainability skills, Christian enrolled in the ASPiRE program. Christian took part in APRIL’s restoration project, Restorasi Ekosistem Riau (RER), where he integrated traditional fishing methods to support the economic and social well-being of villagers near the Serkap Village in Riau. This project empowered fishermen to practice sustainable fisheries, with the goal of maintaining healthy fish stocks while sustaining the livelihoods of local communities. Now part of APRIL’s Sustainability team, ASPiRE taught Christian that accomplishing long-term sustainability goals requires strong commitment and consistent action. “I am grateful for the opportunity to explore sustainability through my enrollment in the prestigious ASPiRE Batch 4 to hone my skills and start a rewarding career in sustainability,” said Christian. From the latest ASPiRE batch, Gigih Radiantama, a Humanitarian Engineering graduate from the Warwick School of Engineering, already has his own unique story to share. He worked with the Community Development Department to address extreme poverty in Riau. Gigih helped navigate the complexities by improving strategies to ensure that future initiatives are more impactful. Gigih also implemented a hands-on approach for surveys he conducted in Pelalawan and Siak to understand the perspectives of extremely poor households. He highlighted the mentorship he received from the department head and managers and the collaborative spirit to help achieve the shared goal. A graduate of the National University of Singapore, Ayu Primastuti, another member of ASPiRE batch 4, also shared her fascinating journey in sustainability. She played an integral role in the realization efforts of multiple APRIL2030 commitments through her participation in projects with different departments. Ayu worked with the Human Resources department to roll out APRIL’s gender action plan, aligned with the company’s Inclusive Progress commitment. Currently, Ayu is finalizing her last project related to APRIL’s Sustainable Growth commitment by assessing and identifying opportunities for water conservation and reduction at the mill. “The program truly extends my knowledge of sustainability including the necessary skills for strategic engagement as well as the technical aspects of the work,” Ayu said. ASPiRE is Opening Applications APRIL is now calling applications for a new batch of ASPiRE for recent graduates with the passion to learn and contribute to a greater cause through sustainability. Upon the completion of the program, candidates can look forward to join a community of high-skilled, multi-national sustainability professionals within APRIL. To be considered for the ASPiRE program, applicants must meet the following requirements: - Holds a Master’s degree from international reputable universities - Have an academic background in environmental or social sciences, public policy, business/management, natural resources, or sustainability - Preferably possess a minimum of 2 years of work experience - Strong interest in climate, nature, people, and sustainable growth/circularity - Possess excellent verbal and written English skills If you aspire to start your own journey with sustainability, more information on the ASPiRE program and application process are available on the company [website](https://www.aprilasia.com/en/aspire), or you can visit APRIL Group on Instagram [@discoverapril](about:blank). The application deadline remains open for passionate young professionals seeking to make a meaningful impact through sustainability.
