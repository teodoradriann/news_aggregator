Then I look at our stats last month and we had one,” said Scott Moore, Wilson County Sheriff’s Office Captain.\n📧 Have breaking news come to you: Subscribe to News 2 email alerts →\nNews 2 asked Captain Moore how many of the 18 threats in September were made on social media. “I would say at least three out of every four,” Moore said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement It’s a trend seen here in Middle Tennessee and across the country.\nIn September, one Mt. Juliet middle school student was taken into custody after a school threat was spread on TikTok. At Barry Tatum Academy, a student was charged with threats of mass violence and two counts of false reports after a bomb threat was made.\n“Whenever we have a school threat, we utilize so many resources. It’s not just the SRO, it involves the detective division and Homeland Security,” Moore said.\nIn response, Homeland Security created an initiative called Project iGuardian to raise awareness about the risks for minors on social media and prevent them from falling victim to tactics used by online predators.\nAdvertisement Advertisement “One of the things and we’ve had cases here in Wilson County involving sextortion and it’s a real problem rising across the country,” Moore said.\n⏩ Read today’s top stories on wkrn.com\nOn Thursday, the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office and Homeland Security want to start a conversation with parents so they can be more aware of online dangers.\n“As parents at home we need to have talks with them and tell them this is why this is important and not be involved or start communication or send pictures like this it’s something we don’t preach enough,” Moore said.\nThe meeting is being held at the Wilson County Board of Education from 6-8 p.m.\nAdvertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Passenger stinks up entire plane with ‘diabolical’ in-flight meal choice: ‘Scented food is a crime’ NY Post Cops Close in on Grinning Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s Murder as They Probe Gun Purchase The Daily Beast Massive lottery jackpot is set to expire.

    "text": "OpenAI has nearly doubled its annualised revenue to US$12 billion in the first seven months of 2025, according to The Information, which cited a source familiar with the matter. The figure suggests the Microsoft-backed firm is generating about US$1 billion a month, with ChatGPT products reportedly drawing around 700 million weekly active users across consumer and business segments.\nReuters said it could not immediately verify the report, while OpenAI declined to comment.\nThe report added that OpenAI has raised its projected cash burn for 2025 to about US$8 billion, an increase of US$1 billion from earlier estimates.\nMeanwhile, the company is lining up investors for the second tranche of its US$30 billion funding round, with shareholders Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management expected to invest hundreds of millions of dollars. Investors, including Japan’s SoftBank, are reportedly close to securing US$7.5 billion in commitments for this phase.\nSoftBank’s total agreed investment in OpenAI has reached US$32 billion since its initial backing in late 2024.",
