    "text": "2-minute read NEWTON — With a unanimous vote, the Sussex County Commissioners on Wednesday declared they had \"no confidence\" in the administration of the Sussex County Technical School , after the school proposed eliminating three programs to save $800,000 from its budget. The vote, on a motion by Commissioner Chris Carney, came in front of an overflow audience that prompted the board's attorney to threaten to stop the meeting because of capacity concerns. Dozens of speakers were on-hand to protest the plan to cut the Sparta school's architecture, graphics and theater arts programs. Part of the standing-room crowd then moved into the corridor as the meeting at the county Administrative Center in Newton continued. Despite the commissioners' rebuke, they offered no sign the county would provide additional funds to help restore the endangered programs. During a tense meeting last week, the school board that oversees Sussex Tech tabled a motion to approve its $15 million budget and promised to further review its plans. The Technical School's five-member board is appointed by the county commissioners. Carney's motion came as Tech School Superintendent/Principal Gus Modla and Business Administrator Jennie Deuel appeared before the commissioners to discuss the proposed cuts of three of the school's 19 academic programs, known as \"shops.\" Carney's motion, seconded by Commissioner William Hayden, came at the end of the public comment period. The motion contained no penalties or other sanctions, but was an \"expression of our total lack of confidence\" in the administration, Carney said. The plan, and the expected loss of seven staff positions, came as a surprise to the commissioners when it was announced at the previous board meeting. Last week, at a meeting of the board that oversees the school, more than 100 speakers showed up to lambasted the plan during a public comment session that lasted for about seven hours. Wednesday's meeting was shorter, but still included a string of upset parents, students and graduates of the school. Sussex Tech offers specialized programs for high school students which local districts find too costly to provide. The school has a capacity of about 800 students and, according to Modla, is nearly at capacity this year. Prospective students go through an extensive interview process. The school is funded by a combination of state and federal aid, money from the county and tuition which is charged to the \"sending\" districts where the students live. More: Five candidates crowd race for two spots in GOP Sussex County Commissioner primary Being considered for the cuts are the theater arts, architecture and graphic communications \"shops.\" Theater arts includes introduction to nearly 40 crafts within the performing arts; architecture includes introductory courses that include both model-making as well as drawing; and graphic communications includes the design and production of items ranging from movie posters, print advertisements and business cards to logos and brochures. The school is overseen by a board appointed by the county commissioners and which meets monthly. At the April meeting, the board tabled action on the school's budget for the coming school year, which included the program and staff cuts. The tech board's next meeting is May 16. Deputy County Administrator Lorraine Hentz told the board that Newton Medical Center has provided $60,000 for a two-year program for county employees to participate in a wellness program. The program could lead to reduced health insurance costs. Email: bscruton@njherald.com Twitter/X: Twitter: @brucescrutonNJH",

    "text": "Prière islamique au Parlement bruxellois: Nawal Ben Hamou affirme avoir été prise au dépourvu\nLa secrétaire d’État à l’Égalité des Chances, Nawal Ben Hamou (PS), a formellement contesté vendredi toute implication dans l’organisation de l’événement au cours duquel un imam a récité une prière à la tribune du Parlement régional.\nREGARDEZ: un imam entonne une prière islamique au Parlement bruxellois\nUne vidéo montrant ces faits, partagée vendredi dernier sur les réseaux sociaux, avait suscité des réactions d’indignation de tous les groupes politiques du Parlement bruxellois. La secrétaire d’État Ben Hamou avait été invitée à prendre part à l’événement organisé à l’initiative du député PS Koyuncu et durant lequel l’incident avait eu lieu, mais elle a souligné avoir signifié aux organisateurs qu’elle ne cautionnait nullement la chose.\nMme Ben Hamou avait quitté l’hémicycle au moment où l’imam a commencé à prier.

    "title": "Friend of OceanGate CEO Testifies That Titan Disaster Was No Accident: 'There Was Nothing Unexpected About This'",
    "text": "The glitter of fame caused OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush to pursue undersea risks with the expectation that one day he would meet one he could not survive, a former colleague and friend said Tuesday.\nKarl Stanley, a longtime buddy of Rush, testified as part of the Coast Guard’s inquiry into the June 18, 2023, implosion of the submersible Titan , in which Rush and four passengers aboard were killed.\n“The definition of an accident is something that happened unexpectedly and by sheer chance,” Stanley said, according to a video clip posted to YouTube .\n“There was nothing unexpected about this. This was expected by everybody that had access to a little bit of information,” he said.\n“And I think that, if it wasn’t an accident, it then has to be some degree of crime. And if it’s a crime, I think to truly understand it, you need to understand the criminal’s motive,” he said.\n“And I think the entire reason this whole operation started was Stockton had a desire to leave his mark on history,” Stanley said.\nWe’re releasing more footage of the Titan salvage ahead of technical testimony and exhibits. The footage includes the aft dome, aft ring, remnants of the hull and carbon fiber debris. Transparency remains our priority as we provide context and information to the public. #TitanMBI pic.twitter.com/o65FrKNCnY\n— USCG MaritimeCommons (@maritimecommons) September 18, 2024\nTwo of Rush’s ancestors signed the Declaration of Independence, according to the New York Post .\n“He knew that eventually it was going to end like this, and he wasn’t going to be held accountable. But he was going to be the most famous of all his famous relatives,” Stanley said Tuesday.\nStanley said Rush was not really a businessman.\n“Stockton’s entire business plan made zero sense,” he said.\nReports have indicated there were warnings about Titan.\nOceanGate CEO Stockton Rush ‘knew’ his doomed Titan submersible would eventually kill him, friend testifies — as new photos of wreckage released https://t.co/l5ItIjh9OL pic.twitter.com/AAuWEu5H09\n— New York Post (@nypost) September 25, 2024\nAccording to Wired , Mark Negley of Boeing warned Rush there was, he believed, a “high risk of significant failure” at the depth of the Titanic , which was where the Titan was operating when it imploded.\nJohn Winters, master marine inspector with the Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound, said Wednesday that Rush never asked the Coast Guard to inspect the Titan, according to the U.K.’s Independent .\n“He did express on multiple occasions that regulations were stifling his innovation process,” Winters said.\nHe also said Rush “never attempted to circumvent any regulations.”",

    "title": "Former Saddleback Church youth pastor now accused of molesting fourth teenage boy",
    "text": "A former Saddleback Church youth pastor who is awaiting retrial for allegedly molesting teenage boys is now accused of abusing a fourth boy he allegedly met through the church. Ruven Meulenberg, a 39-year-old Lake Forest resident, now faces an additional felony count of lewd acts upon a child 14 or 15 years old who is at least 10 years younger than the defendant, on top of similar charges he already faced in connection with a pair of related criminal cases, according to an Orange County District Attorney’s Office statement. “Strong mentors are meant to help our children navigate the difficulties of growing up and realize their full potential,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a written statement about the new allegations.. “Instead of providing the spiritual guidance he pretended to provide, this youth pastor seized on the vulnerabilities of these children for his own sick sexual gratification.” “He has not only forever shaken their belief in anyone in a position of trust and authority; he has irreparably damaged their faith and the faith of countless other parishioners who believed their children were safe with him and youth pastors everywhere,” The DA added. Meulenberg — who at one time appeared alongside his twin brother on a YouTube channel focused on gaming and music production — was convicted in 2018 of molesting twin brothers he met when they were young teenagers attending his youth ministry at Saddleback Church . A prosecutor alleged during that trial that Meulenberg kissed one of the boys on the mouth while he was sitting on Meulenberg’s lap in a darkened movie theater. During the trial, Meulenberg’s defense attorney flatly denied the charges, telling jurors that Meulenberg had “mentored countless kids over the years” and has “zero sexual attraction to boys.” The conviction was overturned due to jury misconduct . One of the jurors — a law office manager — was found to have improperly shared information about the psychiatric testing of subjects in criminal trials. A retrial related to that criminal case has been delayed repeatedly since 2019. The judges and attorneys assigned to the case have shifted multiple times, and the current attorneys have been busy with multiple other trials over the past several years. In the meantime, a second criminal case was opened in 2023 when a third boy came forward to allege that Meulenberg touched him inappropriately when he was 14-years-old between June 2017 and June 2018 while driving him home from a church event. The fourth alleged victim has now been added to that second criminal case, according to prosecutors. It isn’t yet clear whether the cases will be tried separately or at the same time. If convicted of all the charges he currently faces in both cases, Meulenberg faces more than 100 years to life in prison.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

Estos sistemas habrían sido destruidos en una opertación conjunta lanzada en julio entre el Ministerio de Defensa y el FSB, con ataques sobre distintas fábricas en las regiones de Dnipropetrovsk y Sumi, según las notas de ambas instituciones. Según el FSB, este proyecto \"secreto\" de Ucrania se sirve de tecnologías \"heredadas\" de la Unión Soviética para aspirar en última instancia, y con el aval de países de la OTAN, perpetrar nuevos ataques en Rusia. Moscú señala, en concreto, a Alemania, a la acusa de financiar el programa de misiles balísticos ucraniano. El Ministerio de Defensa ha confirmado que durante los ataques contra el programa de misiles Sapsan también fueron destruidos los sistemas de defensa antiaérea desplegados en las inmediaciones de las fábricas y almacenes bombardeados, incluidos cuatro lanzaderas Patriot. |\nEl Juzgado Contencioso-Administrativo de Pontevedra ha anulado una factura de 15.600 € que pretendía cobrar la Distribuidora del grupo Naturgy alegando un “fraude eléctrico” que no ha podido demostrar en el juicio.

    "text": "Temporal La DANA regresa a Mallorca: alerta naranja de la AEMET y aviso del Govern a la ciudadanía Se esperan precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora en toda la isla Duna Márquez Mallorca se encuentra en alerta naranja durante este viernes 1 de noviembre por la [DANA](/tags/dana/) (sigla de depresión aislada en niveles altos) que ha dejado al menos 155 de fallecidos y decenas de desaparecidos en la provincia de Valencia. El pasado lunes, Manacor vivió los efectos de este fenómeno meteorológico con fuertes precipitaciones que dejaron 174 litros por metro cuadrado que provocaron inundaciones, carreteras cortadas e intervenciones de los Bomberos de Mallorca, una de ellas en la Rafa Nadal Academy. Para este viernes se espera que regrese la DANA. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha activado la alerta naranja en toda la isla por precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, llegando a acumularse 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas zonas de la isla en pocas horas. Las lluvias se mantendrán hasta el sábado 2 de noviembre, alargándose el aviso naranja hasta primera hora de la mañana. Con el avance de las horas la alerta desaparecerá, pero las precipitaciones se mantendrán a lo largo del día. El Govern pide \"máxima prudencia\" Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en [Mallorca](/tags/mallorca/) y Menorca. Para coordinar posibles actuaciones conjuntas, la Dirección General de Emergencias ha reunido esta mañana al Grupo de Soporte Técnico del Plan con representantes, entre otros, de los Bomberos del Consell de Mallorca, Bomberos de Palma, Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, Guardia Civil, AEMET, Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca, Ibanat, SAMU 061, Recursos Hídricos y RiscBal. Recomendaciones para la alerta naranja en Mallorca Así, ante la posibilidad de que se produzcan inundaciones como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias y dado que este viernes se celebra la festividad de Tost Sants, se han consensuado estas recomendaciones: - Planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones, prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables. - En el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Se aconseja también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa. - Se recomienda evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa. - En el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento, ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay. - Hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición. - No se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua, ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana. En estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje. - Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112.
