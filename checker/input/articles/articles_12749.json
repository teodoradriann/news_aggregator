    "text": "Apple unveils new child safety features amid age verification debate\nDon't miss out! Get your daily dose of sports news straight to your phone. Join YEN's Sports News channel on WhatsApp now!\nApple unveiled Thursday a series of initiatives aimed at enhancing safety for children and teens using its devices, as it fends off calls that it more directly check the age of its users.\nThe changes came amid growing legislative pressure in US states, including Utah and South Carolina, which have proposed bills requiring app store operators to verify children's ages by uploading official documents and obtain parental consent before minors download apps.\nIn a notable shift, Apple will introduce a new Declared Age Range function that will allow developers to access age information volunteered by parents during an Apple child account setup.\nThis approach represents a compromise between Apple's historical stance of pushing age verification on app creators and the position of companies like Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, that app stores should handle verification.\nThe two tech behemoths, as well as Google which owns the Android operating system, have bitterly fought over the issue as big tech companies face increasing parental frustration on harmful content reaching children and teens.\nUnder the new system, which was announced in a paper published by Apple, the company said it was also streamlining the creation of child accounts, which are mandatory for users under 13 and optional for those up to 18.\nParents can now select their child's age range during setup and verify their status already on file with Apple.\nIn the Apple app store itself, product pages for third-party apps will feature additional information to guide parents, including details about user-generated content, advertisements, and available parental controls.\nApple said some features are already available in the latest operating system updates, with the complete rollout of the age rating system and other features expected later this year.\nIn response to the update, a Meta spokesperson told AFP the move was \"a positive first step,\" but added it did not go far enough.\n\"Parents tell us they want to have the final say over the apps their teens use, and that's why we support legislation that requires app stores to verify a child's age and get a parent's approval before their child downloads an app,\" the company said.\nNew feature: Сheck out news that is picked for YOU ➡️ click on “Recommended for you” and enjoy!\nSource: AFP\nAFP AFP text, photo, graphic, audio or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium.

    "title": "Knicks Star Opens Up About His Unique Relationship With Tom Thibodeau",
    "text": "The biggest pull that gravitated Jalen Brunson to the New York Knicks during the 2022 free agency was his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis father, Rick, is an assistant coach. His godfather and former agent, Leon Rose, is the team president. And to top it all, he would play for Tom Thibodeau, the coach who left an indelible mark on him growing up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It started in Chicago, in 2010, when my dad became an assistant coach for the Bulls,\\\" Brunson revealed in The Players' Tribune. \\\"That’s when I first really understood the type of man and the kind of coach Thibs was. I knew, as a high schooler, that he was a coach who really wanted to win and did whatever it took to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he knew none of that happened without sacrifices — from him, from the players, from everyone down the roster. That showed me the standard early on. That’s when I started to give this game everything I had ...\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Heart of Jalen Brunson-Tom Thibodeau Relationship\\r\\nBrunson has been doubted all his life because as he said he isn't the biggest, the most athletic player.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven his former team, Dallas Mavericks, doubted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it did not stop there even after the Knicks signed him to the most lucrative contract -- $104 million over four years -- a former second-round pick has gotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nBleacher Report and Sports Illustrated graded Brunson's signing as a C while CBS Sports had it worse, giving it a D+.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Brunson learned at an early age as he watched Thibodeau coach the Bulls up close that \\\"preparation feeds your mindset.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Even when you’re working as hard as you think you can, you’re going to have a little sliver of doubt,\\\" Brunson wrote in The Players' Tribune. \\\"But it’s all about your concentration, your preparation and making sure that you’re putting yourself in a position to know that you did everything you could. That’s how you erase that sense of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of that came from my dad, some of that was seeing how Thibs operated in Chicago. Playing for a coach now that has seen me grow over the years has been a great and unique experience. I think that’s what’s really at the heart of it all when it comes to that relationship. We’ve both seen where we’ve come from.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparation Meets Opportunity\\r\\nWhile outsiders view Brunson's free agency signing in 2022 as an overpay, it was the perfect storm for the Knicks and the player who would become their best point guard since Walt Frazier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was when preparation finally met opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Once I got to New York, I understood it even more,\\\" Brunson wrote. \\\"It’s been special to be able to play for my dad, and Thibs, for Leon, and this organization. It’s really a dream come true. That’s all I can say.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not something that you really think about on a daily basis, right? It’s not in my head when I’m out there on the court. But sometimes when I’m really sitting back and chilling on my own, the magnitude really hits me…. How much it all means, not just to be doing this, but to be doing this with family.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrunson has become everything the Knicks hoped for and even more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe's become an All-Star and by season's end, an All-NBA player.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrunson was preparing for this opportunity since Thibodeau set the standard for him in Chicago. It came full circle when his unique relationship with Thibodeau gave him this opportunity to finally lead his own NBA team.",
