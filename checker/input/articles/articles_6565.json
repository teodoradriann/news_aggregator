    "text": "There once was a time when video game adaptations were something not to look forward to, as they were rarely, if ever, given the quality and respect they deserve. For every film that turned out to be good, or at least decent, there were plenty that weren’t. Animated projects were often better, especially ones with Sonic the Hedgehog and friends, but many franchises didn’t dare test these waters. But then, the team at\nRiot Games decided to do things their own way and make a series dedicated to their games’ champions, and now, Arcane Season 2 has gotten its first teaser, and it’s a doozy.\nTo recap, the first season was about the story of VI and Jinx. The two sisters were brought up in incredibly different parts of society and forced to clash with one another. The show was so good that it wasn’t just a hit on Netflix; it won an Emmy award for its animation. The moment that season 1 was over, season 2 was anticipated. And with the teaser below, a key champion is about to make his debut in Arcane Season 2:\nYep, it’s none other than Warwick! The augmented wolf creature is one of the many experiments by Singed, and as the teaser highlights, the experiment to make Warwick what he needs to be is underway. The question here is, “Who is Warwick?” Well, he was a man that was turned into the beast you see. But his identity may change in the second season, as it’s heavily hinted that VI and Jinx’s father, Xander, might be the man whom Singed took and turned into the beast you see.\nIf this holds, then that means there will be plenty of “family drama” in season 2 to go around, and part of it will be the sisters having to team up to not just fight their father but potentially reach him from within his bestial form. Warwick, as a character, is full of rage due to the chemicals that Singed put in his body, so that won’t make him easily susceptible to pleas from his kids, not that he would recognize them in his wolf form.\nThe thing that fans are looking forward to the most is the worldbuilding and style that the first season had. The adaptation was beautiful, and while it took its sweet time to get made, fans will only have to wait until November for the second season to arrive.",

    "text": "Why mobile devices are now the weakest link in cybersecurity – Phones, phishing & your business\nHave you noticed a rise in suspicious messages lately? Maybe it’s a strange SMS claiming to be from Ghana Post asking you to rebook a delivery, or a supposed “bank” requesting your card details—even though you’ve never opened an account with them.\nThese aren’t isolated incidents. They’re signs of a broader and growing threat: mobile device hacking.\nToday, smartphones are more than just communication tools. They are powerful mini-computers—holding our emails, banking apps, social media, company data, and sensitive files. In Ghana, mobile usage is soaring, with smartphones becoming the go-to device for both work and personal use. That’s exactly why cybercriminals are shifting focus—from traditional computer attacks to mobile phone scams.\nWhy it matters for business leaders\nWhether your employees use company-issued phones or personal devices for work (BYOD), each smartphone connected to your organisation presents a potential gateway for cyberattacks. One wrong click, one missed update, one weak PIN—and hackers could gain access to emails, corporate data, financial records, or worse. For business leaders, the stakes are even higher. Your organisation’s cybersecurity is only as strong as its most vulnerable device. That’s why protecting mobile phones is no longer optional—it’s essential.\nStart with awareness – Educate your entire team\nIn Ghana, where many small and mid-sized businesses rely on mobile-first operations, education must be the first line of defence. Your staff doesn’t need to be cybersecurity experts, but they must know how to spot red flags like suspicious links, fake app updates, and social engineering scams. The solution? Regular, easy-to-understand mobile security training for everyone—from interns to executives. Talk about current threats, like recent iOS vulnerabilities or Android malware campaigns, in plain language. Use WhatsApp groups, internal newsletters, or even short video explainers to make it digestible.\nTech giants like Apple have already responded to global threats by introducing advanced features like “Lockdown Mode,” which restricts access to high-risk features on iPhones. While this may be designed for public figures and journalists, it’s still worth educating your team on such options and encouraging quick adoption of security updates when released.\nPair education with strong mobile security tools\nEducation is critical, but it’s not enough on its own. Businesses must also invest in the right tools and policies to secure mobile devices across the organisation.\nMobile Device Management (MDM) platforms allow businesses to control how devices access corporate data, regardless of whether it’s an Android or iPhone. You can:\n• Enforce stronger password or PIN policies (e.g., requiring a 6- or 8-digit code).\n• Restrict access to sensitive apps.\n• Push system updates remotely.\n• Control which apps employees can install.\nAdd Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to key systems like email, CRM, and cloud platforms, and you create another layer of verification that’s difficult for hackers to bypass.\nIn the event a phone is lost or stolen—common in busy places like Circle, Kejetia, or even office car parks—remote wiping capabilities can prevent data from falling into the wrong hands.\nSmall team? Big risks still apply\nWhether you’re a global logistics firm with teams across Accra and Tema, or a startup with ten staff operating from a shared space in East Legon, the risks are the same. One compromised phone can expose sensitive company documents, financial information, or client data. That’s why mobile security should never be considered an “IT-only” issue. It should be part of company culture—just like punctuality or professionalism.\nFinal word – Security starts in every pocket\nIn today’s digital landscape, your employees’ smartphones are as critical to protect as your company servers. And in Ghana, where mobile penetration is among the highest in Africa, this challenge is urgent and real. So, don’t wait for a data breach to take action. Build awareness, invest in smart technology, and treat mobile security as a team-wide responsibility. Because in the end, cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls or antivirus software—it’s about people, habits, and the devices we carry every day.\n>>>the writer is a seasoned cloud architect and systems administrator with expertise in leading technical teams to create innovative platforms.

    "text": "PARIS — The new sport for the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, which open Friday here and continue for 17 days, is breaking. It is more commonly known as break dancing, but the dancing part has been removed, presumably, to deflect criticism and encourage its acceptance as a worthy athletic competition. It also fits the Paris Games in more semantic ways. Because the goal, the hope, the aspiration of these Olympics, truly, is breaking. Breaking with the recent trend of flawed Games, either from authoritarian governments (Sochi and Beijing), overwhelmed organizers (Rio de Janeiro), remote locales (Pyeongchang) or pandemic restrictions (Tokyo). Breaking with the habit of building new venues that instantly become white elephants when the flame is extinguished at closing ceremonies. Breaking even financially, avoiding the tsunami of cost overruns and red ink that have sunk past host cities. Breaking with tradition, hosting the athletes’ parade before Friday’s opening ceremony on 94 barges over a four-mile stretch of the River Seine instead of monotonously marching into a stadium. “It’s not perfect, it’s never perfect,” said Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris organizing committee and a three-time gold medalist in whitewater canoe. “I remember when I crossed the finish line when I was an athlete with the gold medal, I didn’t make a perfect run. Perfect is never the case, but it’s also important to assess what we are willing to deliver. “We dared to be audacious, to be ambitious, to make sure the Games will not be the same as the previous editions.” They arrive at an inflection point in the Olympic movement, with declining viewership, with increasing cynicism from doping and corruption scandals, with cities reluctant to submit host bids, with longtime sponsors departing, with rising terrorist threats, with political decisions jeopardizing its purportedly neutral image. Paris’ great advantage, and Los Angeles in 2028, is that it isn’t using the Olympics to attract tourism or revitalize a region or launder a political ideology through the interlocking rings. A Frenchman, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, created the modern Games in 1896 after seeing a model of ancient Olympia at the Paris Exposition. The city has hosted the Summer Games twice, in 1900 and 1924. France has hosted the Winter Games three times and will make it four in 2030 in the Alps. The 1900 Games didn’t go so well, spread over five months with a litany of obscure sports such as equestrian high jump and a swimming obstacle race where competitors dove under a row of boats in the Seine. Paris got another shot in 1924 and began shaping the current Olympics, introducing the “Citius, altius, fortius” motto (faster, higher, stronger) and a dedicated athlete village of wooden shacks. Johnny Weissmuller won two gold medals in swimming before starring as Tarzan in Hollywood movies. Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi took home five golds in track and field. This, then, is about reshaping the Olympics. Resuscitating, revitalizing, reimagining, rebooting them. “Light up people’s hearts,” French President Emmanuel Macron says. One thing that hasn’t changed from 1900 is swimming in the River Seine. The swimming competition was held there back then, which the competitors liked because a) the river wasn’t as polluted then and b) the strong current meant world record times. France spent $1.5 billion in a massive clean-up campaign in order to stage a triathlon leg and marathon swimming there, with mixed reviews. A protest movement with the threat #JeChieDansLaSeine (literally, “I poop in the Seine”) claims the water quality is still unhealthy, prompting Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo to take a dip herself in wetsuit and goggles. Other venues, most of them in cost-efficient existing or temporary structures, have equally historic and photogenic backdrops. Beach volleyball is in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, fencing and taekwondo in a renovated Grand Palais, skateboarding and breaking at Place de la Concorde, equestrian at the Chateau de Versailles, judo and wrestling at the Champ de Mars exhibition hall, the marathon start at Hotel de Ville, the road cycling course up Montmartre hill past the Sacre-Coeur basilica, tennis on the famed red clay of Roland-Garros. Surfing is on a reef break off the French Polynesian island of Tahiti. Sailing is on the Cote d’Azur in Marseille. The Olympic flame will be displayed not in a stadium but Jardin des Tuileries, a palace garden created by Catherine de Medici in the 1500s on the fashionable Right Bank of the Seine not far from the Louvre Museum. “It’s been very rich,” Christophe Dubi, the Olympic Games executive director for the IOC, said of their journey with the Paris organizing committee, “with people that always had this attitude of, ‘Let’s create, let’s innovate, although Paris offers a lot of history and culture, let’s use this to make it something very special.’ ” It’s not perfect, as Estanguet says, it’s never perfect. Not when you bring 11 million visitors to see 10,714 athletes from 206 nations compete in 329 events over 754 sessions in 35 venues. The biggest challenge is security in a city that has suffered several major terrorist attacks, including one in 2015 that killed 130 people and was attributed to the Islamic State as retaliation for French air strikes in Syria and Iraq. The result is what is considered the largest peacetime security operation in French history, with 45,000 officers drawn from police, military and dozens of foreign countries. In the past few days, groups of uniformed soldiers have appeared on street corners with guns slung across their chests while police are regularly posted at Metro stations. Speed boats with armed officers zoom up and down the Seine. Divers patrol beneath the surface. A no-fly zone with a 100-mile radius will be imposed from 6:30 p.m. to midnight during opening ceremonies, forcing commercial airlines to cancel flights into area airports. Drones have been banned, and police estimate they are intercepting six per day, most by unknowing tourists. France’s interior minister said more than 4,000 Olympic credentials have been rejected on suspicion of being foreign spies or having radical Islamist ties. On Tuesday, authorities raided the Paris apartment of a 40-year-old, Russian-born chef, alleging he was “conducting intelligence work on behalf of a foreign power … to provoke hostilities in France” through a large-scale attack during the Games. There also was a YouTube video posted this week of a masked person claiming Hamas would turn Paris into “rivers of blood” in retaliation for France’s support of Israel’s invasion of Palestine. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has since questioned its validity. “We’re not sure,” Attal told media, “but it looks like it is fake and has been spread by pro-Kremlin and pro-Russian channels.” The other fear is a crippling Russian-backed cyberattack on Games-related computer systems. The Russian team has been banned from the Olympics as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine, although some individual Russian athletes are allowed to compete independently with no national association. All this plays out amid the backdrop of political instability in France. Macron dissolved the National Assembly last month and called for snap elections, with no party receiving a majority of seats to form a new government without creating a coalition. Attal has resigned but agreed to stay on through the Games operating a government without the power to pass laws. But the Games must go on. They always do. The hope is the athletes come to the rescue and provide the ultimate diversion: Simone Biles in gymnastics, Katie Ledecky in the pool, LeBron James on the basketball court, 400-meter hurdler Sydney McLauglin-Levrone on the track, along with French stars like swimmer Leon Marchand, rugby player Antoine Dupont and 7-foot-4 NBA phenom Victor Wembayama. The $10 billion budget, thanks to strong ticket sales and only a handful of new venues, so far is manageable. The Olympic rings hang majestically from the Eiffel Tower. Pollution levels in the Seine remain low. The famed Gallic indifference of Parisians appears to be waning. The opening ceremony dancers called off a threatened strike after receiving a new pay offer. There are reports that Celine Dion and Lady Gaga will partner on a duet of a 1940s song by French singer Edith Piaf, “La Vie en rose.” A rough translation: Life in rosy hues. ©2024 The San Diego Union-Tribune.

    "text": "SICUREZZA INFORMATICA\nWhatsApp nel mirino degli hacker, come funziona la nuova truffa di Flora\nC’è una nuova truffa telefonica che è stata segnalata da decine di utenti in tutta Italia e che potrebbe rappresentare un pericolo per i propri dati personali\nNell’ultimo periodo, sempre più utenti hanno segnalato una nuova truffa telefonica che coinvolge una “voce femminile”, un bot su WhatsApp e tutta una serie di strategie per avviare una conversazione col malcapitato utente, forse, allo scopo di rubare soldi o informazioni sensibili.\nCome funziona la nuova truffa telefonica\nCome già anticipato tutto inizia con una chiamata proveniente da un numero sconosciuto. La persona dall’altra parte del telefono dice di chiamarsi Flora e aggiunge che, a causa di un problema di comunicazione, è meglio continuare a parlare su WhatsApp.\nL’obiettivo di questo primo contatto, dunque, sembra essere quello di convincere il destinatario a contattare Flora su WhatsApp, in modo da poter iniziare una conversazione tramite messaggi di testo.\nUna volta che la conversazione passa sulla celebre piattaforma di messaggistica, questa Flora si rivela essere un bot piuttosto sofisticato che riesce a simulare il comportamento umano, nel tentativo di instaurare un qualche rapporto di fiducia con il malcapitato utente.\nPer rendere questa conversazione ancora più convincente, il bot invia una fotografia dove si vede una giovane donna; foto che probabilmente è stata generata dall’intelligenza artificiale. Questa è una tecnica interessante che dimostra una certa creatività da parte degli ideatori della truffa che, per altro, hanno generato anche una foto piuttosto convincente che potrebbe trarre facilmente in inganno gli utenti meno accorti.\nDopo aver stabilito “un rapporto”, il bot chiede di spostare ulteriormente la conversazione su un altro numero di telefono, proponendo di inviare ulteriori foto per approfondire meglio questa conoscenza.\nA questo punto il bot va un po’ in confusione e non appena l’utente prova a fare qualche domanda, interrompe di colpo la conversazione, diventando inattivo.\nQuale è l’obiettivo di questa truffa e come difendersi\nA ora, non è ben chiara la finalità di questa nuova truffa anche, secondo gli esperti di sicurezza informatica, potrebbe trattarsi di una romance scam, una “truffa romantica” dove i malintenzionati cercano di convincere i malcapitati a instaurare un legame affettivo che, generalmente, termina con una richiesta di denaro. Una truffa piuttosto comune che, negli anni, ha ingannato decine e decine di persone in cerca dell’anima gemella o semplicemente utenti in cerca di qualcuno con cui parlare.\nNonostante questa incertezza, comunque, come ogni volta è consigliabile essere prudenti e non cedere ad alcun tipo di richiesta, soprattutto se provengono da un numero sconosciuto che, chissà per quale motivo, invita le persone a parlare su WhatsApp.\nNon appena si riceve la chiamata, il suggerimento è quello di riagganciare, bloccare e segnalare come Spam il numero, in modo che non possa più nuocere a nessuno.\nPer chi, invece, è già passato alla fase successiva e sta avendo una conversazione su WhatsApp con il chatbot, è importante terminare subito ogni interazione e bloccare il contatto quanto prima. In nessun caso si devono condividere informazioni personali, foto o assecondare qualsiasi altra richiesta proveniente dai malintenzionati.",

    "title": "Mamar Gelaye Walked Away From A Management Consulting Career And Now Aims To Diversify The Tech Sector",
    "text": "As a Black woman tech executive at Amazon, Mamar Gelaye is on a mission to diversify the industry.\nGelaye, an Ethiopia native, has a decades-long career spanning more than 20 years that dates back to her time as a management consultant at Accenture. Her interest in technology was evident while attending the University of Tennessee, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. She even worked on a hybrid electric vehicle project during this time.\nBelief In Technology\nHer faith in the advancements of technology remained strong, and following her time at Accenture, she pursued roles that reflected this.\n“I just really understood that technology was going to transform a great deal. I just understood that software was gonna control the machine,” she explained. “So when I left management consulting, I went into large industrial companies that were kind of big manufacturing, but manufacturing through automation, through kind of transformational engineering.”\nIn her pivot, Gelaye spent 18 years working with General Electric (GE), where she was promoted to several roles across energy, healthcare, and later, digital health.\nDuring a chat with AFROTECH™, she revealed one of her biggest takeaways within her role that has remained with her today.\n“I had a series of techie roles throughout my time at GE, including working abroad,” she said during Amazon’s Delivering the Future event held in Nashville, TN, Oct. 8-9. “What I realized is that a lot of the foundational experience that I had came from undergrad and came from just like these novel experiences… So one of the things I wanted to do was to make those novel experiences more generalizable so that more people with diverse backgrounds, women, minorities, would be attracted to tech.”\nLeading At Amazon\nFollowing brief posts at Raytheon Technologies — serving as vice president and chief information officer — and at United Technologies in the aerospace and defense industries, Gelaye is now carrying her philosophy to Amazon as VP of robotics, operations, and technology.\nShe is currently leading Amazon’s fulfillment technology and robotics organization, which is responsible for designing and implementing the technology infrastructure and devices that power Amazon’s global supply chain operations, Diversity Woman Media mentions.\nAmong the division’s innovations is Proteus, Amazon’s first fully autonomous mobile robot, first displayed in Nashville. It is tasked with moving wheeled carts carrying packages around its fulfillment centers, with loads weighing potentially up to 800 pounds.\n“Here at Amazon, we are a tech first company. The backbone of Amazon is technology. We’ve been doing technology since our inception,” Gelaye explained. “Our organization is essentially, we like to think of ourselves as a quiet scaffolding for Amazon because all of the compute, all of the device technologies. All of the capabilities that we use for fulfillment require automation and require compute.”\nHBCUs Partnerships\nIn the midst of ongoing innovation, Amazon is working to ensure diversity is not an afterthought. It has cemented several partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with the goal of helping their undergraduate students onboard into Amazon development environments to establish foundational skills, Gelaye says. The company has worked alongside Howard University and Hampton University, and it has established a mechatronics and robotics lab at Tuskegee University.\n“So at Tuskegee, which I’m personally working on, we built a mechatronics and robotics lab,” she explained. “Now students that are in computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, they can work alongside Amazon and have these incredible experiences of being Amazonians while they’re on campus. That lowers the hurdle for when they graduate going into industry and having not only skills at parity, but beyond par with the industry.”",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "By Jim Thomas | Thursday, 28 December 2023 07:31 PM EST Ahmed Abou Hashima, founder and chair of MAFI Company for Agricultural Produce Industries, has disclosed plans for an agri-food industrial complex, poised to be the Middle East's largest. Valued at $300 million, the project is a collaborative effort with foreign investment. The signing ceremony was attended by dignitaries including Egypt's Prime Minister Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, Industry Minister Ahmed Samir Saleh, and Hossam Hibah, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones. The event was attended by global agri-food technology leaders. Situated in Sadat City Industrial Zone across 154,000 square meters (1,657,642 square feet) MAFI's complex comprises five cutting-edge plants. It includes Egypt's most extensive orange and tomato concentrate facilities, a pioneering cloudy product plant, and one of the world's largest freeze-drying facilities for fruits and vegetables. With an annual production capacity exceeding 100,000 tons in Phase I, the complex targets a turnover of $200 million. Phase II aims for a production capacity of 200,000 tons, translating to a $400 million turnover. Partners include JBT and Cabin Plant from the United States and GEA from Germany. Beltone Holding Co. conducted studies to ascertain financial viability, while BCG Co. analyzed market dynamics and trends. Hashima emphasized the complex's potential to generate over 7,000 direct and indirect jobs, contributing to Egypt's economic growth. The project's vision includes exporting over 80% of its production, enhancing global market reach, and attracting foreign direct investment. Jim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.
