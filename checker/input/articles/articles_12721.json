    "title": "India’s banks know climate is their biggest threat",
    "text": "By Mihir Sharma\nTwice a year, the Reserve Bank of India reviews the stability of the country’s financial system. Its latest report made for good headlines: The proportion of loans that have gone sour is at a multiyear low, and likely to decline further.\nBut buried in the report is a warning from the very institutions the central bank is charged with regulating. Market participants responded to a survey asking what they saw as the biggest contributors to systemic risk. While they downplayed the usual concerns — asset quality, interest rate risk, capital outflows — one particular threat loomed larger than ever before: climate change. In fact, respondents named it for the first time as the greatest source of systemic risk to the Indian financial system.\nThey’re not wrong to worry. It isn’t just that India, according to the Network for Greening the Financial System, will see sharply lower growth unless temperature rises are controlled. That growth will be more variable and subject to sharper shocks, including those from weird weather and delayed monsoons. This worries the country’s financial arteries; so does the uncertain fate of sectors such as construction, cement and energy, to which they are deeply exposed.\nIndian regulators have been slow to respond. It wasn’t until earlier this year that the RBI finally released a draft framework that would require financial institutions to devise and disclose their strategies to mitigate climate-related risk. Even then, the timeline for adopting the new rules was exceedingly generous. For regular Indian banks, they will only fully come into force for the financial year that ends in March 2028.\nWhat explains the lethargy? Part of the problem is no doubt the bureaucratic inertia that bedevils all policymaking in India. Regulators are scared of stepping on each other’s toes, and on the government’s.\nNobody is sure, for example, who will eventually have the last word on what counts as “green” investment. The securities market regulator moved first to define a taxonomy and a reporting framework for large publicly traded companies. The finance ministry in New Delhi would naturally prefer that any such taxonomy be decided centrally.\nAn inter-departmental task force, with various regulators and ministries represented, is supposedly working on definitions. But it was set up in 2021, and nothing has as yet been decided.\nAt the same time, regulators may be too focused on reinventing the wheel. India’s markets are large enough, and its problems pressing enough, that policymakers here generally believe they have little to learn from attempts made elsewhere to solve the same challenges.\nThis is short-sighted, especially when it comes to financial regulation. Whether a taxonomy or disclosure requirements or climate stress tests, transparent criteria that align with those in use elsewhere are helpful — at least, if you want global investors to understand and trust your standards.\nRegulators might be more motivated to push through disclosures and restrictions — such as, for example, tagging specific loans as being at risk in the green transition — if they thought such transparency would attract greater investment.\nUnfortunately, Indian policymakers no longer entirely believe promises that a greener financial system will allow the country to access pools of sustainable finance globally. India launched a sovereign green bond in 2023. It didn’t sell at much of a premium and was mostly taken up by domestic investors; interest from foreigners seemed low. The RBI canceled the sale of a second tranche scheduled for this year.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, there may be an unspoken fear of what a more stringent examination of climate risk might reveal.\nThe RBI released the results of a preliminary set of climate stress tests in 2023. They found that India’s vast network of public sector banks was particularly vulnerable.\nWhile it’s not exactly clear why — more granular tests have been promised but not conducted yet — the fact is that many of India’s banks have lent heavily in the past to the energy sector. Data from last year showed that banks, even in the public sector, are now balking at financing new coal-fired power plants. That suggests they worry they are overexposed to the sector. (Renewables haven’t faced the same problems.)\nFive years ago, Indian regulators may have been blissfully unaware that climate change posed macro-economic risks. They no longer have that excuse. The very report that identified climate change as a major problem also listed, in exhaustive detail, how other central banks and regulators are responding. The roadmap is there — India just needs to pick up the pace.\nADVERTISEMENT",

    "text": "Jimmy Gressier, fondeur détenteur de plusieurs records en France et aligné cette semaine sur les JO 2024, était visé par une enquête pour harcèlement sexuel. Elle a été classée pour \"infraction insuffisamment caractérisée\". L'enquête pour harcèlement sexuel visant l'athlète français Jimmy Gressie r, qui a concouru mercredi aux JO 2024 de Paris , a été classée le 2 juillet pour \"infraction insuffisamment caractérisée\", a indiqué ce jeudi le parquet de Paris à l'AFP, confirmant une information de Mediapart .\nL'enquête avait été ouverte à la suite d'un signalement du directeur général de l'Institut national du sport, de l'expertise et de la performance (Insep) en octobre sur le fondement de l'article 40 du code de procédure pénale, permettant à toute autorité de signaler des faits à la justice, et confiée au commissariat du 12e arrondissement. Elle visait selon le parquet à \"vérifier si les faits évoqués devaient être qualifiés pénalement de harcèlement sexuel\".\n\"Il est ressorti des investigations qu'à la suite d'une relation consentie de quelques semaines, Jimmy Gressier avait continué à avoir un comportement ambigu, auquel il a mis un terme après avoir compris que son interlocutrice ne le souhaitait plus\", a précisé le parquet. Le ministère public a souligné qu'\"aucune plainte n'a été déposée\" et \"aucune poursuite disciplinaire n'a été engagée\". \"L'enquête administrative avait déjà conclu à l'absence d'éléments à charge contre mon client, j'observe que le parquet de Paris arrive aux mêmes conclusions à l'issue d'une enquête préliminaire\", s'est félicité Me Antoine Maisonneuve, avocat de l'athlète.\nClaire Palou: \"J'aurais aimé que les choses soient davantage prises au sérieux\" Jimmy Gressier, fondeur détenteur de plusieurs records en France, est arrivé 13e vendredi de la finale du 10.000 m aux JO de Paris, et a été éliminé mercredi en séries du 5.000 m. Le signalement faisait suite à une commission d'enquête parlementaire sur les dysfonctionnements des fédérations dans le sport, alors que la Fédération française d'athlétisme (FFA) avait été critiquée par des athlètes pour son inaction en matière de violences sexistes et sexuelles. Le 5 septembre 2023, l'athlète Claire Palou, auditionnée par cette commission, avait notamment rapporté des faits de harcèlement sexuel qui se seraient déroulés à l'Insep, au coeur du Bois de Vincennes.\nDepuis, Claire Palou a publiquement accusé Jimmy Gressier, partenaire d'entraînement, d'avoir eu des comportements ou propos inappropriés après une relation consentie par le passé. Interrogée le 1er août par Mediapart sur ce classement de l'enquête, Claire Palou a répondu: \"J'ignorais que l'enquête avait été classée. Je n'ai même pas été auditionnée par le commissariat chargé de l'enquête. Je ne comprends pas comment c'est possible. On m'a simplement demandé si je voulais déposer plainte, et j'y ai finalement renoncé\". \"J'aurais aimé que les choses soient davantage prises au sérieux\", a-t-elle ajouté.\nRR avec AFP Top Articles\nJO 2024: déception pour Bennama en argent en boxe, Team USA défiera les Bleus en finale",

    "text": "Shares of JD.com ( JD 2.74% ) jumped as much as 5.2% early Thursday then settled to trade up 2.8% as of 3:45 p.m. ET after the Chinese e-commerce giant revealed it's planning sweeping raises for its front-line staff next year.\nIn a post to its official WeChat account this morning, JD.com said it will nearly double the fixed salaries for its procurement, sales, and other front-line staff beginning Jan. 1, 2024. JD.com also said its retail staff will receive 20%+ pay increases.\nA vote of confidence from JD.com The market appears to be taking this development as an encouraging vote of confidence in JD.com's growth trajectory. JD.com has struggled to drive top-line growth in recent quarters -- with revenue last quarter rising a modest 1.7% year over year -- amid fierce competition and macroeconomic uncertainty that has dampened consumer spending in China.\nAt the same time, however, JD.com shares surged earlier this month after the Chinese government initiated new stimulus measures designed to stimulate the country's economic growth and bolster its struggling property sector. If these significant pay raises are any indication, perhaps JD.com is already seeing some of the early positive impact of those stimulus measures.\nWhat's next for JD.com investors? JD.com should be slated to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results in early March. On the former, most analysts are modeling an accelerated 6.2% increase in quarterly revenue, which would mean a slight (0.2%) decline in revenue for all of 2023.\nMost analysts will be more focused, however, on any clarity JD.com management can give investors with regard to growth in the coming year. With consensus estimates on Wall Street calling for a return to top-line growth of 6.8% for 2024, any incremental optimism would be well received by shareholders looking for JD.com's growth headwinds to abate.",

    "text": "El Pipi , actual DT de la Reserva, está casi confirmado para asumir el comando de la Primera azulgrana . Firmaría en las próximas horas.\nLeandro Romagnoli será confirmado en las próximas horas como entrenador de San Lorenzo y se convertirá en el reemplazante de Ruben Darío Insúa, luego de una serie de respuestas negativas de otros candidatos y en medio de su interinato al frente del conjunto azulgrana.\nRomagnoli, que ya dirigió al plantel profesional en la última fecha de la Copa de la Liga, en el empate 0 a 0 con Central Córdoba en Santiago del Estero, estará en el banco este martes ante Liverpool de Uruguay por la tercera jornada de la fase de grupos de la Copa Libertadores.\nSi bien su presencia en Montevideo ya era un hecho, este miércoles el \"Pipi\" se reunió con el presidente Marcelo Moretti y con el coordinador del fútbol profesional, Néstor Ortigoza, y apenas restan detalles para que sea anunciado como el DT del \"Ciclón\" para, al menos, el segundo semestre.\nAlgunas de las cuestiones a resolver aún son el armado del cuerpo técnico, dado que se sumarían nombres como el del ex lateral izquierdo Germán Voboril y un preparador físico. Además los directivos deben llegar a un acuerdo con Insua, ya que el vínculo se extendía hasta diciembre de 2025 y todavía no se llegó a un acuerdo en cuanto a lo económico.\nLos principales candidatos fueron Luis Zubeldía y Gabriel Heinze, pero ambos rechazaron la propuesta de San Lorenzo. Más tarde surgió la opción de Nicolás Larcamón, de último paso por Cruzeiro de Brasil, pero el técnico de 39 años pidió al menos un mes para agarrar el cargo y en Boedo no cuentan con ese tiempo para iniciar el nuevo proyecto. Ante esto, la figura de Romagnoli ganó terreno y el propio ex enganche se postuló en la conferencia de prensa posterior al empate con Central Córdoba.\n\"Tengo la ilusión de dirigir a San Lorenzo, no puedo mentir. Estoy cómodo en la Reserva, me dejan trabajar tranquilo, quería hacer experiencia, pero siempre pienso en dirigir la Primera. Si me toca la posibilidad, bienvenido sea. Si no, seguiré en la Reserva. No estoy apurado\", indicó el \"Pipi\", que en las próximas horas agarrará el timón de forma definitiva.\nVideos relacionados: Aparecen en esta nota: Leandro Romagnoli San Lorenzo",

    "title": "Thunderstorm warning for Cork as Storm Gerrit brings strong winds and heavy rain",
    "text": "Met Éireann has issued a status yellow thunderstorm warning for Munster, Connacht and Donegal, as Storm Gerrit continues to impact the country. The warning, which came into effect shortly after 8am this morning, will remain in place until 9pm on Thursday night, bringing a risk of further power outages, dangerous driving conditions and localised flooding. Hundreds of houses remain without power following the arrival of the storm, which brought strong winds and heavy rainfall across the country. ESB crews are working to restore supplies to homes and businesses after Storm Gerrit knocked out power overnight, with Galway and Wexford among the areas worst hit. In Cork, over 100 households are still left without power, following last night's thunder and lightning. According to the ESB's PowerCheck, over 200 households remain without power in Co Galway. A total of 862 customers were without power in Kilflynn, Co Kerry this morning, after a major fault occurred following torrential rainfall. Cork County Council confirmed there was no significant damage as a result of Storm Gerrit, which led to fallen trees and debris in parts of the county. A total of 13 trees fell over the course of Wednesday, which crews responded to diligently to clear the obstruction. \"There are no reports of any significant damage to property. High tides have passed without incident,\" the statement read. Intense thunderstorms in Wexford, great photo of lightning strikes by Dec Roche and large hail by Anita Cousins.— Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather) [pic.twitter.com/g9jr1e85gR] [December 27, 2023] The heavy rainfall led to spot flooding across parts of Cork city and county, with motorists advised to drive with caution due to the risk of damage to road surfaces. The council has also addressed the rising river levels, which are of \"no immediate concerns\" at present. Demountable flood barriers have been erected in both Mallow and Fermoy as a precautionary measure. \"Council crews are on the ground across the county responding to issues and prioritising the most critical issues where necessary,\" the statement read. \"In the event of disruption to power supply, please contact ESB Networks at 1800 372 999. In the event of disruption to water supply, please contact Uisce Éireann at 1800 278 278. In an emergency please dial 999 or 112,\" “Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me…😳😱⛈️⚡️⚡️⚠️.— Alan Mac Cárthaigh 🇮🇪 (@AlanMcC82) [#StormGerrit]really ramping up along [#Courtmacsherrry]Bay & Seven Heads Peninsula & Old Head of [#Kinsale]in [#WestCork], [#Ireland]with non-stop ‘very intense’ [#thunderstorms]!! 😱🌀🌪️ ⚡️⚡️💥⚠️ [#thunderstorm]… [pic.twitter.com/TF1O6IRPJB] [December 27, 2023] The aftereffects follow heavy gusts of wind recorded across the country last night, with winds of up to 98km/hr recorded in Sherkin Island in Cork last night, followed by gusts of up to 90km/hr, which were recorded near Shannon Airport. The power cuts follow a nationwide status yellow wind and rain warning which was in place since 8pm on Tuesday and will remain until midnight on Thursday. \"Very strong and gusty southwesterly winds in conjunction with spring tides, may lead to coastal flooding,\" said Met Éireann. \"Squally showers, with a chance of thunderstorms, may lead to localised flooding.\" A taxi driver in Waterford City was hospitalised last night after his car was hit by a falling tree during high winds. It happened in the Newtown area at around 11pm, and the driver was treated for minor injuries. Gabriel Hynes, Senior Engineer with Waterford City and County Council has urged the public to exercise caution. “Our ground crews are attending to a number of fallen trees and roads blocked as a result of yesterday’s Status Orange weather event. While the worst of the weather has passed, the current thunderstorm warning is expected to bring some scattered thunderstorms and spells of rain, which could lead to localised and spot flooding. These conditions combined with fallen branches and debris on the roads will make travel hazardous,\" he said. Mr Hynes advised motorists to avoid driving through flooded roads and instead choose an alternative route to avoid injury, adding: \"flood waters can be deeper than they appear\". Met Éireann issued another weather warning, which came into effect at midnight and affected those in Clare, Kerry, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo. The status yellow wind warning will see \"southwest winds veering westerly\" which will be strong and gusty at times. \"A combination of spring tides, large waves and strong winds may result in some coastal flooding.\" That warning is in place from midnight until 6am on Friday. On Wednesday, in Skibbereen, in West Cork, the river Ilen burst its banks, flooding hundreds of acres of farmland north of the town. But thanks to its flood defences, the town remained dry. Last night, Kerry County Council issued a warning to those in the county to \"stay away from all coastal areas\", including Beara Peninsula, amid the ongoing dangerous conditions. Alan O'Reilly of Carlow Weather said the gusty weather is expected to continue into today, with \"very windy\" conditions expected throughout the day. The National forecaster has predicted a chance of \"gales\" on Atlantic coasts at times on Thursday, leading to a \"continued chance of coastal flooding\". Some frost or ice is expected to land later on in the day, with lowest temperatures of 1C to 5C expected. Friday will again see sunny spells and scattered blustery showers while Saturday be windy with sunny spells and wintry showers. Sunday is shaping up to be a calmer day with sunny spells and well-scattered showers.

    "text": "Bills star Josh Allen reacts to being voted most overrated QB by NFL players\nBy the Numbers\nBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was named the most overrated quarterback in a recent ESPN poll of 103 NFL players, receiving 11 votes. He acknowledged the criticism during an interview, stating he isn't bothered by the opinions of players outside his team but expressed disappointment over not being invited to participate in the survey himself. Despite leading the league in turnovers since 2018, Allen has been recognized for his performance, being a two-time Pro Bowler and ranking among the top quarterbacks in passing yards and touchdowns in the 2023 season.\n- Josh Allen has 102 turnovers since his rookie year, the most in the NFL.\n- In the 2023 season, he ranked top five with 4,306 passing yards and 29 touchdown passes.\n- Allen was also voted the best trash-talker with 27 votes, well ahead of Baker Mayfield's 16.\n- In the poll for the top NFL quarterback, he ranked fourth behind Mahomes, Jackson, and Burrow.\nIf Allen can lead the Bills back to the playoffs this year with a revamped offense, he may gain respect from his peers and shift perceptions about his capabilities.Bottom Line\nDespite being tagged overrated, Allen's impressive stats and performance illustrate that he remains a top-tier quarterback in the league, showcasing the disparity between peer perception and on-field results.\nRead more at\n CBSSports.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
