    "text": "La huelga general indefinida convocada en el servicio de logística de Solvay se mantiene desde el próximo martes 3 de diciembre, tras concluir este viernes sin acuerdo una nueva mediación entre los sindicatos y la empresa concesionaria Katoen Natie convocada por el Organismo de Resolución Extrajudicial de Conflictos Laborales (Orecla). El comité de empresa de la logística de la fábrica de Barreda (UGT, CCOO y USO) prosigue así con sus movilizaciones, incluidos los paros de dos horas en cada turno de trabajo iniciados este pasado lunes 25 de noviembre y secundados hasta el momento por una media de un 90% de la plantilla de fábrica, según los sindicatos.\nEl presidente del comité de empresa de Katoen Natie, Lorenzo Fernández (UGT), ha explicado en un comunicado que tras la reunión en el Orecla, “todo sigue igual porque la empresa no quiere saber nada de respetar nuestros derechos laborales ya adquiridos de anteriores concesionarias, ni de pagarnos los tóxicos y penosos que cobra toda la fábrica menos nosotros ni de proteger la salud y seguridad de la plantilla con un cumplimiento estricto de las normas de prevención de riesgos laborales”.\nPor eso, la plantilla pasará de los paros de dos horas a la huelga general indefinida a partir del próximo martes, que continuará “hasta cuando sea necesario”, ha advertido Fernández.\nAdemás, ha anunciado que el comité de empresa ya ha denunciado a la Inspección de Trabajo, y lo demandará en los tribunales de justicia, que la empresa esté sustituyendo a trabajadores en paro por empleados de empresas de trabajo temporal.\n“Es inaceptable e ilegal que se vulnere de un modo tan descarado el derecho constitucional a la huelga y no lo vamos a permitir”, ha aseverado el presidente del comité, que ha criticado que, tras casi un mes de movilizaciones, “ni la empresa ni Solvay, que es quien paga, se dan por aludidas”.\nLa huelga general en el servicio de logística de Solvay del 3 de diciembre, que afecta a una plantilla de 73 trabajadores, sucede a las concentraciones de protesta que se iniciaron en la portería de la fábrica de Barreda el 4 de noviembre y los posteriores paros horarios que comenzaron el pasado lunes 25.",

I\nwill upload a schematic of the adapter soon, it will be easier to\nunderstand than me trying to explain.\nI have done some measurements on them to make the xover. If\nsome one can merge different measures to a polat plot I'll be\nglad to mail them. The diffucalty to measure them is to choose\nwhere to place the mic, the frequency response change with\nboth distance and angle. My room is so tight that I can't listen on\naxis, so for the cross over design I measured them between the\ncenter cell and the one at it's side.\nI have no problem with vibrations what so ever in these horns. If\nI knock on them they are dead silent. When all the cells were put\ntogether three of four sides were covered vith fiberglass. Then I\npoured polyester from above so all the voids between the cells\nwere filled with polyester. The horns are filled with about 20 kg\nof polyester each. With the JBL 2445 they weigh just above 40\nkg a piece. You can lift one by your selve but it is not a nice experience.\nWithout xover the horn have good output down to about 250-\n300 Hz, but due to the variations in the acoustic reactanse and\nresistanse I would not cross them lower than 400-500 Hz. this is\nsomething that I found out after the horns were built. My\nintention was to use it from 350-400 Hz. Would be intresting to\ntry them with JBL midrangedriver, because the 2445 is not ment\nto be used lower than 500 Hz.\nA friend of mine has the Altec 288 and 1505B, his horn are sand filled and that works too, the black kloggy stuff is not too nice to handle.\nThe small one has a flare of 300 Hz and it is also a pure\nexponential horn. The one who built that one is using it together\nwith JBL 2226 and a RCF tweeter, The small horn goes higher\nand a bit more open sound if both horns (183 and 300 Hz) are\ncrossed high. That's why I chose a quite low xover freq, 3000 Hz\nand up to that freq. it sounds really good.\nView from a multicell, at a friends house\nI'll come back to continue...\nMember\nJoined 2002\nI noticed the clear fill after I posted...\nConsider an oil finish on the wood, if you have not yet done anything to it....\nThe ratings in terms of frequency for the compression drivers are based on two things:\n- power handling, or full power bandwidth at the rated power\n- physical compliance of the diaphragm's surround\nSo, if the diaphragm can move below the rated LF cutoff in a linear way, the driver will go down to whatever freq the horn permits. But the manufacturer will only rate the driver to a particular frequency based upon its ability to handle full output, and still remain within xmax. That usually means a higher cutoff than the diaphragm can actually handle, IF the max SPL does not exceed some Xmax figure.\nIn typical home use that is way way below where it becomes a problem. Consider that most compression drivers (pro ones) are intended to run up to about 128dB SPL, whereas the typical average listening level is <100dB at home... quite a bit of headroom.\nCertainly enough headroom for careful testing at minimum.\nI use a Japanese driver with a first order filter (one cap) on my 300Hz. horns and have played direct into the system with my band (electric guitars, drums, bass, vocals) in the listening room, uncompressed, at ~100dBSPL average in the space with no ill effects. The JBL and Altecs might not do as well (different diaphragm construction) but worst case you can put a spacer under the mount (frequently they are supplied by the Mfrs to recone houses to center the VC windings in the gap) and gain enough clearance IF there is a slight excursion (Xmax) problem found...\nIf you say that you have variations below your present xover point, it's likely due to insufficient mouth size, and/or that the horns are foreshortened a bit to be similar to the slightly shorter 500Hz style horns... which is ok, but as I said before I have had a far better listening experience when the horn to midbass xover is lower, not higher, and the horn carries the \"voice frequencies\" (aka \"telephone frequencies\") completely - ie. <300Hz and up...\nMaybe for your next horn?\nRegards,\nConsider an oil finish on the wood, if you have not yet done anything to it....\nThe ratings in terms of frequency for the compression drivers are based on two things:\n- power handling, or full power bandwidth at the rated power\n- physical compliance of the diaphragm's surround\nSo, if the diaphragm can move below the rated LF cutoff in a linear way, the driver will go down to whatever freq the horn permits.

    "text": "It seems 2024 may be the year of romance for\nJustin Theroux. While he keeps his romance with Nicole Brydon Bloom out of the public eye, insiders claim that their romance is hotter than ever, and they made this big step together.\nDespite their\n23-year age gap, the insiders insist that they’re nuts about each other, so much so that Bloom took Theroux as her plus one to her twin sister Chrissy’s wedding in NYC on Dec 21, 2023.\nIf you need any more proof that this happened, Bloom posted a series of photos from her sister’s big day to her\nThe insider told\nLife & Style on Jan 5, 2024, that “When Nicole met Justin, they just hit it off. She’s nuts about him, and friends say Justin is pretty crazy about her, too.”\nSo, it seems the two are closer than ever, especially since he was her plus one and even made it to her Instagram.\nIt seems as though the pair have been dating for around a year, after first being seen together in Feb 2023. Since then, they’ve kept their romance on the\n low-key side, rarely making public appearances in New York City.\nIn a previous interview with Esquire, he talked about how his previous marriage to Jennifer Aniston has made him want to\nstay quiet about his new romance. “People will always want to gossip and say things, but you have to find that balance. Me saying anything, even if it was something loving, it would just turn into a thing. So it’s a classic no-comment situation for me,” he said.\nBefore you go, click\nhere to see famous men who routinely date women half their age.",

    "text": "- Residents of St. Johns, including Amy Riedel, experienced a stunning display of the Northern Lights, showcasing vibrant green and pink colors in the night sky. - fox 47 Meteorologist Jake Derees advises viewers to find dark areas away from light pollution for the best viewing experience, noting that while clouds are expected tonight, the peak viewing hour at 10 PM should still offer good visibility. - Watch the video for more info on the Northern Lights. (The following is a transcription of the full broadcast story) The Northern Lights are back again. I’m your St. Johns neighborhood reporter, Russell Shellberg, talking with one neighbor who is sharing some spots to get the best photos. “It was very green, pink, and just gorgeous...” said St. Johns resident Amy Riedel. On Thursday, neighbors like Amy Riedel saw the neon-colored skies, capturing the colors in their glory. Riedel says it was a breathtaking sight. “You could see them in the sky with your eye, but obviously not the same view as when using your phone. But just the colors were gorgeous, and to see that different people in the community had posted their pictures and the different colors and locations, it was just pretty spectacular,” said Riedel. And if you missed the bright colors last night, there is still a chance. I spoke with our meteorologist, Jake Derees, to talk about the best ways to view them. “The main thing is to get away from any light pollution, anywhere where there is a lot of light around. Usually, driving out to where there is, again, not a lot of light. We also need those clear skies,” said Derees. Jake told me that we are expecting some clouds tonight, but the peak viewing hour for the lights at 10 PM should still provide a good view of the colored night sky. “You have a little bit more time to go out and play with your phones or your cameras and kind of get an idea of what to do, what to look up, and see something that doesn’t happen very often,” said Riedel.
