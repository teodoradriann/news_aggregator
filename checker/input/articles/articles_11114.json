    "text": "YAKIMA, Wash. — After a suspenseful day of burning, evacuations and simply waiting, people in the Terrace Heights area near Yakima are back home while crews monitor the [remnants of the Key Road fire. ](/article/news/local/wildfire/yakima-wildfire-evacuation-notices/281-f08ee12d-0be8-4a44-9f93-b87b44cdb5a2) \"It was no fun being around here,\" said Craig Rust, who lives about a quarter-mile away from the fire line. The county issued a Level 3 evacuation on Friday morning, June 21, telling residents to \"get out now.\" \"My wife was calling me and keeping me informed while I was at work,\" he said. \"She had everything ready, all the medications and money gathered up.\" The Rusts, like most residents in the immediate area, were without power as crews assessed the severity of the threat. \"The house was getting warm and it was getting warm around the corner where the fire was burning,\" Rust said. \"I was worried about my food spoiling in the refrigerator and freezer.\" According to Washington Department of Natural Resources spokesman Ryan Rudrock, the fire has been contained to just 25 acres at Sportsman State Park. He credited the [state's aerial attack initiative](/article/news/local/washington-aerial-firefighting-fleets-more-than-doubled-since-2016-wildfire-season/281-638a1b01-0a92-497e-b38c-bcda9f83d401) with limiting the spread of the fire, adding that four Yakima-based helicopters were in the air within minutes. \"That's why it's 25 acres and not the whole state park,\" Rudrock said. Shortly before 8 p.m. on Friday, the county reduced the evacuation to a Level 2, meaning people could go home, but were still warned to be ready to evacuate. By that point, crews were monitoring hot spots and addressing hazardous trees. On Saturday, they continued to monitor the area as temperatures soared toward 90 degrees. Red Flag Warning The National Weather Service (NWS) [ issued a Red Flag Warning](https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=SEW&wwa=red%20flag%20warning) on Saturday, expecting dry and breezy conditions on Sunday. The Red Flag Warning is in effect from 1-8 p.m. Sunday for wind gusts and low humidity for fire weather zones of the Lower Columbia Basin in both Washington and Oregon. Winds could reach up to 40 miles per hour and the relative humidity could be as low as 15 percent. NWS warns that windy conditions combined with low humidity can result in rapid fire spread. \"A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can contribute to extreme fire behavior,\" according to the NWS. NWS also issued a wind advisory for Kittitas Valley, just north of Yakima, on Saturday. It will remain in effect from 5 a.m. Sunday to midnight Monday. Residents can expect northwest winds up to 35 miles per hour, with some gusts reaching 50 miles per hour, according to the NWS. The NWS warns gusty winds could dislodge tree limbs and lead to power outages.",

    "text": "Dr. Boris Marx producing PLA blend with a stereo-complex crystal structure at the Fiber Institute in Bremen. Photo Credit: AIF\nTechnical fibers make the ropes of children’s swings safe or are indispensable in medical operations. The base material for these fibers are often petroleum-based polymers. In view of the limited availability of fossil raw materials and challenges with plastics, Dr. Boris Marx from the Fiber Institute Bremen eV (FIBRE, Germany) is looking for alternatives with biopolymers. He is one of the nominees for the 2022 Otto von Guericke Prize Scientists for special innovative achievements in the field of pre-competitive industrial joint research (IGF) — which builds a bridge between basic research and commercial application — funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics via public funds.\nBiopolymers such as polylactide (PLA) consist of bio-based, renewable raw materials and, in contrast to the usual polymers made from petroleum, are biodegradable. PLA is made by chemical synthesis based on lactic acid. Commercially available PLA is processed into yarns that can currently be used for home textiles, for example. However, the strengths for technical applications are not yet sufficient.",

    "title": "Is Dalit Politics At An Inflexion Point?",
    "text": "The results of the 2024 general election appear to mark a significant shift in Dalit politics. There seems to be a sweeping departure from the traditional focus of Dalit politics on challenging India's entrenched caste-based hierarchy. Historically, various Dalit political parties, such as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the north, the Republican Party of India (RPI) in Maharashtra, and others like the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), the All Manipur Dalit Development Association, the Puthiya Tamilagam (PT) in Tamil Nadu, and the Praja Rajyam Party (PRP) in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring states, have shaped Dalit political discourse in India. However, many of these parties have weakened over time, reflected in their diminished political influence. The question of whether independent Dalit politics has a future in India is frequently debated. As India's democracy evolves, Dalits may increasingly assert themselves within the mainstream political landscape. Dalits constitute 16.6% of India's population, making their vote pivotal in shaping electoral outcomes. As a result, they are being aggressively courted by national parties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. Take Uttar Pradesh, for instance, which is a crucial state in determining the national election results due to its significant number of Lok Sabha seats. Dalits account for 21.1% of the state's population, and thus their voting patterns are a critical area of study. In the recent elections, Uttar Pradesh witnessed a departure from long-standing trends. Jatavs, a traditionally loyal group within the Dalit community known for their support for Mayawati's BSP, showed signs of shifting allegiance. Additionally, a segment of the BJP's core supporters and youth, who had remained faithful since 2014, switched their support to the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress alliance, citing local issues, anti-incumbency sentiments, unemployment concerns, and apprehensions about constitutional amendments. The successful strategy of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress alliance in weaning Dalit votes away from the BSP in the recent elections exemplifies this shift. The alliance strategically fielded local candidates, further fragmenting the BSP's vote base. The SP's vote share rose from 17.96% in 2019 to 34% in 2024, directly correlating with the BSP's decline from 19% to 9% during the same period, leading to existential challenges for Mayawati's party. The entry of the Azad Samaj Party into politics further fractures the Dalit movement, widening existing divides. After a commanding victory in a four-way race involving his party, the INDIA bloc, the BJP and the BSP, Chandrashekhar Azad further solidified his status as a rising Jatav youth icon. Similar Dalit voting trends can be observed across several states. The outcome of the 2024 election surprised many. However, a closer examination reveals that this stemmed from swing states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Haryana, and Rajasthan, where the Lok Sabha election became more local than national, affecting the BJP in around 70 seats. The Dalit vote also demonstrated a local focus in what was a national election. Is Dalit politics at an inflexion point? In 2024, Dalit votes were impacted by a number of factors. Political parties are swiftly moving to integrate Dalit politics into their platforms, recognising the emerging trend. They anticipate that Dalit votes will wield significant influence in the 2029 elections, particularly in rural areas, prompting a race among parties to establish early footholds. For instance, the Uttar Pradesh Congress unit plans to set up Dalit chaupals and sammelans to engage community members at the grassroots level and consolidate its electoral gains, with a major outreach campaign slated for the 2027 Assembly elections. The BJP is actively recalibrating its strategy. Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections and the period leading up to 2029, it is crucial for the party to regain the complete confidence of Dalit voters. The direction forward hinges on the type of politics embraced - whether it is focused on empowerment or entitlement. Under Modi, the BJP has emphasised empowerment through initiatives like Nal se Jal and providing LPG connections and stoves to elevate living standards. Conversely, in Karnataka, the Congress has placed emphasis on entitlement through direct cash transfers to individual accounts. The future trajectory will depend on how the BJP refines or expands its welfare policies, and, crucially, who emerges as the voice of the Dalits. Historically, Dalit women have been pivotal. But signs suggest that youth will increasingly shape the narrative leading up to 2029.

Com a tensão durante a prova e a cabeça quente do piloto, o holandês foi chamado até de infantil por Lambiase.\nPara o GP da Bélgica, última prova do calendário antes das férias de meio da temporada, o clima já parece mais amigável na Red Bull.\nEm entrevista à repórter Mariana Becker, Verstappen destacou que não existe outro esporte em que o atleta está com um microfone na boca durante a prova.\nEu acho que isso é do esporte, certo? Em outros esportes você não tem um microfone preso em sua boca, é isso o que nós somos. Quanto mais pessoas assistem, mais elas têm opiniões diferentes. Mas, no final do dia, eu estou aqui pela performance, para sempre tentar dar o meu melhor. O holandês também comentou que não é a primeira vez que briga com o seu engenheiro, e que essas discussões são fáceis de serem resolvidas.\n“Não é como se fosse a primeira vez. Discussões, argumentações, essas coisas, no final do dia, elas devem ser fáceis de se resolver. Você segue em frente e foca no próximo final de semana”, disse o holandês.\nNa polêmica no GP da Hungria, sobrou até mesmo para a estrategista do time austríaco, Hannah Schmitz. “Temos todas as informações, (mas) talvez eu tenha que instalar no carro e fazer isso sozinho”, afirmou o piloto durante a prova do último fim de semana.\nMax Verstappen não sabe o que é uma vitória na Fórmula 1 desde o Grande Prêmio da Espanha, em junho. Apesar da ‘seca’, o tricampeão minimizou o momento da Red Bull.\n“São algumas corridas sem vitórias. Nós não fomos os mais rápidos e agora é o nosso momento de virar o jogo e ser mais competitivos. É isso que nós estamos tentando fazer”, disse o piloto.\nO GP da Bélgica de Fórmula 1 acontece neste fim de semana, nos dias 26, 27 e 28 de julho. O histórico Circuito de Spa-Francorchamps recebe a 14ª etapa da temporada 2024, e a corrida tem transmissão de Band.com.br e Bandplay a partir das 9h30 (de Brasília) do domingo, ao vivo e de graça.\nVeja também\nHaas confirma rumores e anuncia contratação de Esteban Ocon para 2025\nAlpine ganha visual 'Deadpool & Wolverine' para disputar o GP da Bélgica\nGP da Hungria de F1 2024: onde assistir, horários e programação completa Tópicos relacionados Fórmula 1 Esportes Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing",

    "text": "La inteligencia artificial (IA) ha encontrado un nuevo y curioso uso en la Iglesia de San Pedro, en Suiza, donde se emplea en las confesiones.\nEste innovador proyecto, denominado ‘Deus in Machina’ (Dios en la máquina), utiliza tecnología avanzada para crear un holograma de Jesús que interactúa con los feligreses.\nVoceros de la iglesia explicaron que el sistema es sencillo: los feligreses presionan un botón y aparece un holograma de Jesús, ofreciendo orientación espiritual basada en las enseñanzas del Nuevo Testamento. Este sistema, creado por informáticos y teólogos de la Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Artes de Lucerna, ha sido desarrollado tras meses de trabajo.\nEl holograma, programado con avanzados algoritmos y textos religiosos, puede comunicarse en más de 100 idiomas. Al encender el holograma, se advierte a los feligreses que no deben revelar información personal y que usan el servicio bajo su propio riesgo. El sistema interpreta las palabras de los feligreses y genera respuestas mientras el rostro animado de Jesús se mueve en sincronía con sus recomendaciones.\nEste proyecto ha causado polémica, generando opiniones divididas entre los feligreses. Mientras algunos ven con fascinación el uso de IA en la iglesia, otros consideran que las respuestas generadas son genéricas y carecen de espiritualidad.\nLa iglesia espera que este innovador sistema pueda expandirse a otras partes del mundo, proporcionando orientación espiritual a través de la tecnología. Sin embargo, el debate sobre su efectividad y autenticidad continúa.",
