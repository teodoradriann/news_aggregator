    "text": "A father who is still fighting for justiceCAPT SAURABH KALIA: Along with five other soldiers of his patrolling team, Saurabh was captured alive, brutally tortured, and killed by the Pakistan Army. In the small hill town of Palampur, you don’t need addresses to reach the houses of martyrs. All I do is put my head out of the window and ask, ‘Kya aapko Capt Saurabh Kalia ka ghar maloom hai?’ [Do you know Capt Saurabh Kalia’s house?]’ People smile and guide me with gestures of the hand and tilts of the head, leading us in no time to a house with a sign at the gate that tells us we have reached a family that has borne personal loss. It is the internationally recognised icon of an upside-down rifle with a war helmet placed on top — a tribute to fallen soldiers. medium nocaption109786633 ShowQuotesThe dates 29 June 1976 to 9 June 1999, inscribed on black marble beneath Capt Saurabh Kalia’s name, are a reminder that he died before the best years of his life. The Kalias tell me how Naughty, as his parents called him, was as a boy — quiet and reticent, fond of cooking for his family and friends. They joke about how difficult it was to wake him up in the mornings and how when Mrs Kalia was told that in the Indian Military Academy (IMA) early risers were ordered to wear boots and run on top of late risers, she quickly got Saurabh an alarm clock, telling him worriedly, ‘Tu toh subah uthta hi nahi hai beta; tere upar toh woh roz boot waale ladke daudayenge. [You can never wake up early, son; they will make boys with boots run on top of you every day.]’ He had called home on 30 April 1999 to wish Vaibhav (his younger brother) on his twentieth birthday. He had said he was going ahead to the forward posts and might not be able to stay in touch for a while. ‘Don’t worry about me if I don’t call or write. I shall be home for my birthday (29 June),’ he had said. And then there had been silence. Saurabh Kalia was never to call the family he loved so much again. Vijaya Kalia, who suffered a heart attack the day she heard Saurabh had gone missing, gave up her government job soon after his death but says she did not shed a single tear for him. ‘It would have diluted the magnitude of his sacrifice. I am very proud of my son. He gave his life for his country.’ A shattered Dr Kalia vowed that he would fight for the human rights of his son and five comrades who were subjected to torture for more than three weeks and make sure that the guilty were punished. Dr Kalia’s journey has been long and painful with roadblocks at every stage. ‘It doesn’t matter whether I get any success or not. I shall continue to fight for these soldiers till I die.’ A brave mother who didn’t want another soldier to risk his life for her son’s bodyCAPT HANEEF-UD-DIN: Awarded Vir Chakra posthumously; Subsector West was renamed Subsector Haneef in his honour. The Shyok, river of death in Yarkandi Uyghur, meanders through these vast forgotten lands before slipping into Pakistan and merging with the Indus at Skardu. Adjacent to Subsector Haneef, named after the young officer who died on this craggy mountainside exactly two years after he had passed out of the IMA. It is poignant that this young boy with a Hindu mother and a Muslim father, who grew up celebrating both Eid and Diwali, died in a war between two countries that had been split on the basis of communal ideologies. He had gone to fight for 11 Rajasthan Rifles whose war cry is ‘Raja Ram Chandra ki Jai’. Haneef ’s body lay under the open sky and falling snow for 43 days, his handsome face frozen into a cold mask. When then Army Chief Gen Ved Prakash Malik visited Hema Aziz, Haneef’s mother, in her small Mayur Vihar apartment in Delhi and told her the body could not be retrieved because the enemy was firing constantly, she met his eyes bravely and said she did not want another soldier to risk his life to get her son’s body back. medium nocaption109786812 ShowQuotes‘After the war is over I would like to go and see where he died,’ she said. Haneef ’s body was eventually retrieved. He was buried with full military honours in Delhi. Hema Aziz made the pilgrimage with her other two sons to Turtuk, to see where her son, who used to laughingly complain that she never had time for him, had given up his life for his country. This time, he was not around to see her.A soldier’s last letterLIEUTENANT VIJYANT THAPAR: Posthumously awarded Vir Chakra.‘Dearest Papa, Mama, Birdie and Granny,’ begins the last letter that Vijyant (Robin) wrote to his family from Kargil in June 1999. ‘By the time you get this letter I’ll be observing you from the sky, enjoying the hospitality of apsaras. I have no regrets. In fact, if I am reborn as a human I will join the army again and fight for my nation,’ he writes on the purple Forces Inland letter, his neat handwriting filling up the page. ‘If you can, please come and see where the Indian Army fought for your tomorrow.’ He adds that whatever organ can, should be taken; he asks his parents to donate money to an orphanage and asks them to give Rs 50 every month to Ruksana, a three-year-old Kashmiri girl he had befriended in Kashmir during his short stint there. He signs off with a brave, ‘OK, then it’s time for me to join my clan of the Dirty Dozen. My assault party has twelve chaps. Live life kingsize. Your, Robin.’ medium nocaption109786999 ShowQuotesVijyant had written this letter to his family just a few days before he went to battle. It’s the reason Col. Thapar comes to Knoll each year to commemorate the death anniversary of his son. And though it is becoming more and more difficult for Col. Thapar to make the treacherous climb to Knoll every passing year, he plans to honour that commitment for as long as he can. Bravery goes beyond bordersLATE CAPT KARNAL SHER KHAN OF THE PAKISTAN ARMY: Martyred at Tiger Hill.Soldiers recognise and respect bravery, even if it is the enemy. A perfect example of this is the case of the late Capt. Karnal Sher Khan of the Pakistan Army. Very few people know that the Indian Army was instrumental in the officer being awarded the Nishan-e-Haider, Pakistan’s highest gallantry award, which is equivalent to India’s Param Vir Chakra. In July 1999, Capt Sher Khan was holding five strategically located posts in the Tiger Hill area, touching a height of 16,700 feet. It was so well-defended that General VP Malik stated in his book, Kargil — From Surprise to Victory, that it appeared almost impossible to capture. According to an officer of 8 Sikh, ‘After a fierce battle, we recovered Tiger Hill on 4 July. For the next four days we were gradually advancing to recover other features — the Helmet, India Gate and Rhino Horn. Soon after the soldiers of 8 Sikh recovered the feature on 7 July, around 8am, Capt Karnal Sher launched a swift counterattack with just a handful of Pakistani soldiers. medium nocaption109787188 ShowBlurbsIt was suicidal for him to do so in broad daylight because we could see his movements. Yet in the highest of military traditions, he launched an attack.’ Such was the ferocity of his attack that 8 Sikh had to be reinforced by a platoon of 18 Grenadiers. Karnal Sher Khan fought till the end and finally fell when a hail of bullets hit him. Even in his last moments his hands were holding his rifle. The Indian Army wrote to the Pakistani government citing the bravery of the young officer. On the basis of this recommendation, Capt Karnal Sher Khan was posthumously awarded the Nishan-e-Haider.

    "text": "Super Eagles forward, Victor Boniface was in action as Bayer Leverkusen commenced their Champions League campaign on a winning note, beating Feyenoord 4-0 on Thursday. The Nigerian international who was making his first appearance in the competition, gave a good account of himself. He was substituted in the 63rd minute for Patrik Schick. His Nigerian compatriot Tella was on the bench for the entire 90 minutes of the game. It was a poor start to the match for the Rotterdammers as they went a goal down in the fifth minute. Ramiz Zerrouki lost the ball in the midfield, which was punished by Florian Wirtz, who hit it low and hard into the bottom corner. Read Also: Wright Thumbs Up Aina’s Display Vs Liverpool Leverkusen’s second goal came in the 30th minute. Boniface powered past two Feyenoord players before playing a skillful no-look pass to Dutch international Jeremie Frimpong, whose low cross found the team’s other wing back, Alejandro Grimaldo, at the far post. The Spanish fullback only had to tap it home to make it 0-2. Six minutes later, it was 0-3. A counterattack gave Frimpong the space to get his second assist as he played an inch-perfect cross to Wirtz, who side-footed it home with ease. A free kick from Grimaldo was sent to the far post, where Edmond Tapsoba headed it back across and saw it go in via some poor goalkeeping from Timon Wellenreuther. Got what it Takes?

    "text": "[Sociedad](/actualidad/sociedad/) Denuncian que la sobrecarga de trabajo en residencias de la Junta en Burgos pone en riesgo la salud de profesionales y residentes El sindicato de técnicos auxiliares de enfermería (SAECYL) exige la dimisión de la directora de RRHH por el deterioro continuado de los servicios sociales Burgos Los profesionales y algunos residentes de la residencia Fuentes Blancas de Burgos se han concentrado este jueves como medida de protesta ante la inacción de la Junta por la sobrecarga laboral que los profesionales del centro y del CAPDI (Centro de Atención a Personas con Discapacidad Intelectual), están sufriendo desde hace meses sin que ni la Gerencia de Servicios Sociales de la Junta de Castilla y León, la Inspección Provincial de Trabajo, la Dirección Técnica de RRHH (Recursos Humanos) y Gestión de Centros y el Procurador del Común hayan adoptado ninguna medida para solucionar el problema. El pasado 29 de julio ya exigimos la dimisión de la directora Técnica de RRHH y Gestión de Centros de la Gerencia, Belén Bausela, por el deterioro continuado de los servicios sociales, del que es plenamente consciente habida cuenta de los años que llevamos exigiendo una solución a la situación de las residencias de la Junta por el mal proceder de esta directora. Sin embargo, lejos de dimitir, continúa en su puesto sin tomar ninguna medida para mejorar las plantillas, que deberían estar completas en estas instituciones donde se atiende a usuarios cada vez más dependientes, que precisan de cuidados constantes e individuales. Por ello, desde SAECYL hemos exigido en múltiples ocasiones que se adopten soluciones inmediatas a partir de un estudio de cargas para aumentar la plantilla orgánica y un estudio psicosocial en los centros residenciales que tienen problemas de personal; pero también creemos urgente que se establezcan nuevos métodos de llamamiento en la Bolsa de Trabajo, que no sancionen con tres meses aquellos que se quedan sin efecto tras la comunicación o con seis las ofertas rechazadas, pues esto supone que la bolsa se queda sin efectivos y las plantillas bajo mínimos. En este sentido, también se deben revisar los procesos de contratación para que estos sean tan ágiles como en SACYL. “La falta de personal no se puede parchear desplazando a profesionales del CAPDI y, en ocasiones, de otras residencias, para cubrir tunos de mañana y de noche en Fuentes Blancas. La situación es tan alarmante, que la dirección se ha visto obligada a cerrar un ala y reubicar a los usuarios. Esta situación está repercutiendo negativamente en la salud de los profesionales, sobrecargados por la situación, y en la de los usuarios, a quienes es imposible darles la calidad asistencial que merecen. Necesitamos que de forma inmediata se cubran las plantillas y se adapten a la realidad sociosanitaria de Burgos y por ello seguiremos luchando como llevamos meses haciéndolo”, explica la responsable de SAECYL, Sonia Mª Tellez.",
