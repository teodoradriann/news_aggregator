    "text": "DISCO Takes Cecilia AI Platform to EU and UK\nEurope has proven more cautious about AI, but legal tech providers are meeting the regulatory challenge.\nIn a move extending generative AI’s global reach in the legal industry, DISCO announced the launch of its Cecilia AI Platform across the European Union and the UK. Note how we said, “European Union and the UK” as opposed to just “European Union” there? The UK blew up its whole economy just so we have to append its name separately! Brilliant trade-off.\nAlas, Cecilia AI promises to streamline the data-heavy lift of modern document review and ediscovery, aiming to turn days and weeks of discovery work into hours.\nGetting AI into the hands of the European market requires navigating Europe’s complex regulatory environment. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act erected a framework to address the risks and ethical concerns posed by AI, introducing stringent requirements on transparency, accountability, and the ability to explain AI decisions. Satisfying Europe’s call for visibility in AI decision making involves a little extra work than in the U.S., but in addition to the products launched this week, DISCO expects to have more generative AI tools in that market in 2025.\nWith this launch, DISCO introduces Cecilia Q&A to the European market. This AI fact expert is fully integrated within a user’s DISCO Ediscovery database. Lawyers can interrogate their document sets directly, receiving quick, citation-backed answers that highlight key documents swimming within the terabytes of data. It’s a tool designed to put eyes on the most important documents quickly and efficiently. Or, if the attorney wants, there’s a single-document version of Q&A that limits the interrogation to one item. All of which is done without sourcing source information from online, with answers limited to the information within a customer’s specific database.\nBasically keeping AI from hallucinating by cutting off access to the internet shrooms.\nAnd the document summary function creates the reader’s digest version of lengthy, complex or important documents to speed up the all-too-familiar process of slogging through a long document only to realize it’s totally irrelevant.\nWhich gets back to the theme I took away from my ILTACON meeting with DISCO — generative AI’s most powerful application might just be its appeal as an interface. Legal tech has had the power to deliver a lot of these insights for a while. Providing material relevant to a query or generating a ‘Key Word In Context’ style summary existed before. But now, AI’s ability to offer a natural, conversational interface — delivering coherent, easily reviewed results — makes a difference.\nBut something about generative AI products have proven more accessible to the lawyerly mind. Personally, I think it’s the iterative nature of the interface. Prior technology could only answer the most recent query and left it to the user to figure out if their prompt delivered the right result. Hunting and pecking but with inquiries. Generative AI learns from its interactions with the user mimicking the back-and-forth between a partner and associate and improving the results incrementally. This dynamic interface feels more intuitive to lawyers, who are used to a process of refining insights through dialogue.\nAnd occasionally yelling.\nWhatever it is, studies reveal that these AI tools have brought many senior attorneys to technology for the first time when they would historically farm that work out to juniors or outside providers. It will be interesting to see if the European and UK contingent follow their American counterparts in embracing this tech.\nBecause technology is only useful if it gets used.\nJoe Patrice is a senior editor at Above the Law and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer.

Stay safe!— WeatherNation (@WeatherNation) [#CoastalFloodWarning] [#CAwx] [pic.twitter.com/gt1rbANJ5c] [December 28, 2023] At least three factors help to create these dramatic wave heights: wind speed, fetch, and time. Fetch being the area over the ocean where winds blow and generate waves, says the weather service. The longer the weather system sits there, the higher the waves will be. These type of weather systems are also more common during the winter months.

Andrés Manuel López Obrador me pidió coordinar los esfuerzos del tema del deporte, así mismo como el Licenciado Esteban Moctezuma. Desafortunadamente, digo desafortunadamente, los esfuerzos que hicimos, de coordinación, de apoyo de todos ustedes, pues muchos participaron en esos foros, se incluyeron en un documento que desafortunadamente, no se llevó a cabo en este sexenio, motivos habrá, se sabrán, en su momento la historia lo va a juzgar”.\n“Cuando yo me enteré que Marijose iba a llegar al Comité Olímpico Mexicano y Ana Guevara a la CONADE dije bueno pues mujeres, yo creo que se van a identificar bien y vamos a sacar adelante nuestro deporte mexicano. Es mejor que en nuestro deporte se hable de los triunfos, de los resultados, de lo que hemos hecho, de lo que se ha logrado, más que se hable de temas extra deportivos, eso si es muy lamentable, creo que eso ya no va a pasar”.\nEl cargo Reprocha Bernardo Segura a AMLO: “en su momento la historia lo va a juzgar” apareció primero en Newsweek en Español .",

    "text": "The report underscored Gen Z's ambition and desire for growth. Forty-seven per cent Gen Z professionals plan to leave their jobs within two years, while as many prioritise work-life balance when evaluating potential employers, according to a survey. The report, titled \"Gen Z at workplace\", is based on a survey of over 5,350 Gen Z and 500 HR professionals, conducted by Unstop -- a talent engagement and hiring platform for students and graduates. The report highlighted a significant concern among Gen Z professionals, with 51 per cent expressing fear of job loss at present. This anxiety extends to their career prospects, as 40 per cent worry about securing positions in their preferred fields upon entering the job market. \"Despite these reservations, Gen Z demonstrates a clear set of priorities when it comes to their careers. 77 pc of the respondents prioritise the role or brand over commercials, with 43 pc specifically seeking hands-on experience and growth opportunities. This focus on professional development is further emphasised by the fact that 72 pc of Gen Zs consider job satisfaction more important than salary,\" the report said. The study also revealed a disconnect between Gen Z's motivations and HR perceptions. \"While 78 pc of Gen Zs switch jobs for career growth, 71 pc of HR professionals assume it is primarily for better pay. In reality, only 25 pc of Gen Zs prioritise money as their main motivation while switching jobs. \"Work-life balance is one of the crucial factors to consider in any job for Gen Zs, with 47 pc of them citing this as a key element when evaluating potential employers. Their ideal workday involves completing routine tasks efficiently, leaving room for skill-building and productivity without feeling overwhelmed,\" it said. The report underscored Gen Z's ambition and desire for growth. Their top priority is a solid career path with room for promotions, accompanied by a vibrant, supportive culture. \"While 44 pc of recruiters believe Gen Z values company culture more than career progression, the reality is more nuanced. Gen Z seeks a balance of both, with a strong emphasis on opportunities for personal and professional development,\" it said. The report also delved into other aspects, such as Gen Z's top reasons for switching jobs, top concerns while entering the job market, their expectations with respect to mental health, and their varied working style that shifts from the one-size-fits-all approach. \"For the youngest generation in the workforce, work isn't just a place you go to every day to get your account credited regularly. It has to fit into several key aspects of your life seamlessly,\" Ankit Aggarwal, Founder and CEO of Unstop, said. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"They (Gen Z) are reminding us that work should be a part of life, and not the other way around... It's a call to action for employers and recruiters. Those employers who adapt to these fast-changing expectations will be preferred by the new generation of employees,\" he added.

    "title": "On connaît l’une des raisons du divorce de Jennifer Lopez et Ben Affleck",
    "text": "On l’apprenait récemment : entre Jennifer Lopez et Ben Affleck, rien ne va plus, à tel point que cette première a officiellement demandé le divorce.\nDes années après leur première tentative de mariage, Jennifer Lopez et Ben Affleck avaient décidé de se donner une nouvelle chance. En vain, puisque deux ans après s’être dit « oui », le couple se sépare, et on connaît aujourd’hui l’une des raisons qui a poussé JLo à demander le divorce.\nLire aussi:\nQui de Ben Affleck ou Jennifer Lopez risque d’y perdre le plus lors du divorce?\nUn sentiment d’impuissance\nEt la faute reviendrait à Ben Affleck. Selon des sources proches des stars, Jennifer Lopez en aurait eu marre de devoir s’occuper de son chéri. “Elle passait beaucoup de son temps à s’assurer que Ben était heureux et qu’il avait tout ce dont il avait besoin”, a ainsi confié un ami de la chanteuse.\nLa façon dont elle s’occupait de lui était presque enfantine. Ses amis lui rappelaient constamment qu’elle n’était pas responsable de ses émotions.\n, a-t-il ajouté. Un comble pour Jennifer Lopez, qui avait tout de même sorti un titre intitulé “I ain’t your mama” (”je ne suis pas ta mère” en français). De plus, la star aurait eu du mal à gérer le caractère lunatique de Ben Affleck, dont l’humeur pouvait changer d’une seconde à l’autre. “Il ne pouvait pas se cacher, même s’il essayait de le faire” a confié une source proche du couple, en parlant du comportement de l’acteur.\nSur les dernières années écoulées, Jennifer Lopez a enchaîné les projets. Forcément, son besoin de souffler était essentiel, mais il n’a malheureusement pas pu être comblé comme elle l’aurait souhaité, justement en raison du comportement de son (ex)chéri. “Quand les sautes d’humeur, les hauts et les bas créent une toxicité omniprésente, personne ne peut vous aider — vous devez vous aider vous-même, a ajouté la source. Bien sûr qu’il y avait de l’amour, tout le monde les adorait mais celui qu’il prétendait être et celui qu’il est devenu étaient deux personnes différentes.”\nLire aussi:\nVous avez repéré une erreur ou disposez de plus d’infos?",
