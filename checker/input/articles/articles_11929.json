    "text": "Tourists eat hotpot in an ice house in temperatures below minus 20 C at Harbin Ice and Snow World in Heilongjiang province on Wednesday. SU QIANG/FOR CHINA DAILY Topics on winter tourism have circulated all across the internet after Harbin's \"ice world\" in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang brought in nearly six billion yuan during a three-day holiday earlier this month.\nThe city — famous for snow views and ice sculptures — saw both traveler numbers and tourism revenue reach record highs of 3.04 million and 5.9 billion yuan ($837 million) respectively during the New Year's Day holiday from Dec 31 to Jan 2, according to Harbin's culture and tourism bureau.\nHarbin's success has epitomized the vigorous growth of China's winter tourism industry in the post-Winter Olympics period.\nA recent report by the China Tourism Academy predicts that the winter season from late 2023 to early 2024 will see traveler numbers exceed 400 million for the first time, bringing in tourism-related revenue of 550 billion yuan.\nAccording to the academy, the previous winter season saw 312 million people take winter tours and produced tourism revenue of 349 billion yuan.\nThe report by the tourism academy said that individual tours have grown to be the major choice for winter travelers in recent years. According to the report, individual winter travel from Nov 1 to mid-December increased by 46.3 percent compared with the same period in 2019, before COVID-19 hit, while group tours for winter fell slightly by 0.14 percent.\n\"Harbin is a 'front-runner' in China's winter sports and winter tourism … that will embrace a new era for its winter tourism development after gaining the opportunity to host the 2025 Asian Winter Games,\" said Dai Bin, president of the China Tourism Academy.\nHe said that Harbin's success this winter is because of its sound infrastructure and thoughtful services.\n\"The city offers goodwill and warmth to travelers. The best tourism lies in the human touch and travelers can have good experiences in the city with kindness and generosity from the local people.\"\nLi Shengwen, director of travel portal Tuniu's business in central and northeastern provinces, said that she and her peers have observed a continuous surge of winter bookings as domestic tourism has grown more diversified and professional.\nShe said traditional winter destinations including Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, the northeastern provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region are top choices for travelers, while some indoor ice theme parks and ski resorts in southern provinces also saw remarkable growth.\nShe said some of the platform's users even booked tours to Mohe in September. The city in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang is recognized as the \"North Pole\" of China where people can see auroras.\n\"Yanji in the Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture, Jilin province, has also been growing in popularity this winter. We added some tailored services like photography services to travelers to let them experience the culture of the Korean ethnic group in addition to the snow views,\" she added.\nHowever, the domestic winter tourism industry still faces shackles hampering its development. According to the tourism academy, the growth of domestic winter tourism requires efforts from governments and industry operators to secure the industry a more stable and sustainable development.\nInsufficient use of ice and snow-related avenues and facilities, as well as weaker branding and innovation need urgent solutions, the report said.\n\"We still hold a very bullish view on the future development of winter tourism, and Harbin has set us a very good example. The winter tourism market in northern provinces still has great potential and resources yet to be fully unleashed. We will see a better and more mature winter tourism industry after the services can be improved,\" said Li.\nchengsi@chinadaily.com.cn",

    "text": "A scenic town in Sweden may have gotten more than what it bargained for after interested residents responded to the authorities’ efforts to raise the population numbers in the picturesque locale.\nThe town of Götene, 200 miles southwest of Stockholm, is selling 30 plots of land with prices starting at just 1 krona, or 5.58 pesos, per square meter (11 square feet).\nIn a statement given by the town’s Mayor Johan Månsson to CNN, this said promotion aims to lure new residents to the rural region amidst the national housing crisis, high interest rates, and declining birth rates.\nGötene gives residents a taste of a quiet slice of rural Sweden, with about 5000 full-time residents and 13000 people living in the surrounding municipality. It is located on the shores of Lake Vänern, the largest lake not only in Sweden but also in Scandinavia and the entire EU with it being around 10 times the size of Lake Constance.\nThe only requirement needed in order to acquire this land was that the lucky buyers start building a home on the site within two years of their purchase.\nWhen the land went on sale last May, Månsson stated that there were about 30 interested buyers that had reached out. In the following weeks, the program went viral that led to thousands of new buyers starting to contact the Götene City Hall.\n“We have two people in our phone exchange in city hall, and they have been very sweaty over the past few days,” he stated. “We’re basically in crisis mode.”\nWith the program becoming a quick sensation, calls are now coming from around the globe, as stated by Månsson.\nThe local authorities have decided that they would put a pause on the program until early August in order to create a plan for handling incoming requests.\nMånsson also stated that four buyers were able to get four of the cheapest plots before everything went into chaos.\nThe program will most likely be using a bidding for the remaining land when the applications reopen next month.\nOther POP! stories that you might like:\n‘Digital preservation under threat’: Internet Archive battles legal challenges\nUS bank’s wild idea to combat call center burnout utilizes AI, weirds out the internet\nLegendary MLBB star ‘OhMyV33NUS’ announces departure from Blacklist International, social media users react\nLily Allen launches feet-focused ‘OnlyFans’ account after earning five-star rating on WikiFeet\nUS bank’s wild idea to combat call center burnout utilizes AI, weirds out the internet",

    "text": "By Karl Plume (Reuters) – The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) removed head coach Bev Priestman on Thursday following her suspension by Canada Soccer over a drone spying scandal that has thrust the 2020 Olympic gold medallists into an unsavory global spotlight. The Canadian women’s squad will be led by assistant coach Andy Spence for the remainder of the Paris games, the COC said. “Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue said in an emailed statement. “In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women’s National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.” Canada defeated New Zealand 2-1 in their Paris Olympics opening game on Thursday, a match which Priestman voluntarily sat out after the spying scandal broke this week. Priestman apologised to the New Zealand players for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her. “This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.” (Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Editing by Neil Fullick)",

    "title": "Gasoline forecast: Lower overall prices in 2024 | News | oleantimesherald.com",
    "text": "> GasBuddy on Thursday released its annual fuel price outlook with some good news for drivers: expect lower gasoline and diesel prices in 2024.\nThe outlook highlights key trends in gasoline and diesel prices, forecasting that, after two years of above-average gas prices, 2024 will bring relief at the pump for consumers as several factors contribute to less of a pinch at the pump. GasBuddy expects the yearly national average will drop from $3.51 per gallon this year to $3.38 in 2024.\nHighlights from GasBuddy’s 2024 outlook:\n• Gas prices still could fall below a national average of $3 per gallon this winter before starting to rise in late-February, getting close to $4 per gallon as summer approaches, then mildly declining into summer, with hurricane season presenting uncertainty in late summer.\n• Drivers in some California cities could again briefly see prices above $6/gallon if major refinery issues develop during the summer, although most major U.S. cities will see prices peak at or slightly below $4 per gallon in 2024.\n• Americans are expected to spend a combined $446.9 billion on gasoline in 2024. Average yearly spending per household will fall to an estimated $2,407, down 2% from 2023, and over 12% less compared to 2022.\n• Electric vehicles (EVs) and the 2024 presidential election have the potential to impact fuel prices in the year ahead, with a potential slowdown in the EV transition at stake.\n• Memorial Day will be the priciest 2024 holiday at the pump, with the national average price of gasoline expected to be $3.56-$4.04 per gallon on the holiday.\n“As 2023 fades away, I’m hopeful those $5 and $6 prices for gasoline and diesel will also fade into memory,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. “The global refining picture continues to improve, providing more capacity and peace of mind that record-setting prices will stay away from the pump in 2024.”\nDe Haan anticipates there will still be some volatility, unexpected outages and disruptions, and potentially weather-related issues, but he does not expect it to lead to record prices.\n“Offsetting OPEC+’s production cuts is contributing to the rise of U.S. oil production, which now stands at record levels,” he said. “Combined with Canada, North American oil production could further stabilize countries that have decided to curb oil production.”\nMore uncertainty is expected with hurricane season in late summer. Diesel prices are also predicted to fall incrementally from 2023, peaking at $4.13 per gallon in March 2024.\nEarlier this week, GasBuddy reported average gasoline prices in New York fell 5.5 cents per gallon from the previous week, averaging $3.33/g Monday.\nPrices in New York were 19.9 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stood 3.6 cents per gallon lower than a year ago.\nThe national average price of diesel rose 0.6 cents in the last week and stood at $4.00 per gallon.\nIn Olean, the average price for 87 octane dropped from the previous week’s $3.699/g to $3.599/g, which was posted as of Thursday. In Bradford, Pa., the price was the same this week.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, lowest price in the state to begin the week was $2.49/g while the highest was $4.39/g, a difference of $1.90/g.\nThe national average price of gasoline rose 2.9 cents per gallon from last week, averaging $3.07/g to begin the week. The national average was down 13.8 cents per gallon from a month ago and stood at 1.8 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data.\nSome other New York regions and gas prices earlier this week included Buffalo at $3.52/g, down 3 cents; Syracuse at $3.34/g, down 1.8 cents; and Rochester at $3.41/g, down 3.8 cents per gallon from last week’s $3.44/g.\nAAA Western and Central New York reported demand for gasoline has been strong amid the 10-day holiday travel period, when AAA predicted nearly 104 million motorists would drive 50 miles or more from their home.\nIn addition, oil prices are creeping higher back toward the $80 a barrel mark. If these trends continue, motorists could see gas prices rise.",
