    "title": "Paterson, Bosch give South Africa edge over Pakistan in first Test",
    "text": "By AFP 26 December 2024 Debutant fast bowler Corbin Bosch said South Africa reaped the rewards for “holding our nerve” against aggressive Pakistan batting on the first day of the first Test against South Africa at SuperSport Park on Thursday. Bosch, the son of a Test fast bowler, took a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket and finished with four for 63 as Pakistan were bowled out for 211.Dane Paterson, enjoying a late-career surge at the age of 35, took five for 61 – his second five-wicket haul in successive Tests. Pakistan opening bowler Khurram Shahzad struck twice and Mohammad Abbas claimed a late wicket as South Africa reached 82 for three at the close.Pakistan’s approach made for frenetic cricket after Bosch broke a cautious opening stand of 36 when he had Pakistan captain Shan Masood caught at first slip for 17.Opening partner Saim Ayub (14) and Babar Azam (4) followed in quick succession but Pakistan opted for attack rather than a defensive rebuild. Pakistan coach Aaqib Javed said in a pre-match television interview that he didn’t expect a significant difference in approach from his players after they beat South Africa 3-0 in a one-day series which ended on Sunday. ‘Not backing down’ Javed reasoned that positive stroke play was required to score runs on a seam-friendly pitch.It seemed the majority of Pakistan’s batsmen were still in aggressive one-day mode. Both Paterson and Bosch benefitted from batsmen playing poor strokes.“When we saw them really coming at us we just said, be patient,” said Bosch. “There was enough in the wicket that if you held your area there was always a ball that was going to get them out.”“It was (about) holding our nerve and not backing down,” added Bosch.Saud Shakeel hit three boundaries off his first five balls after the loss of Azam before gloving a catch to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne to be out for 14 off six balls.Kamran Ghulam was undeterred, racing to a 52-ball half-century and sharing a rapid 81-run fifth-wicket stand with Mohammad Rizwan (27).Ghulam went for his shots, sometimes to the frustration of the South African bowlers, and his feisty effort included an exchange of words with Kagiso Rabada – South Africa’s most impressive bowler despite not taking a wicket – and Verreynne.Ghulam was out for 54 in bizarre fashion, charging down the pitch to Paterson and top-edging a slog to long leg.But former Pakistan batsman Ramiz Raja, commenting on the match for SuperSport television, defended Ghulam and the rest of the batsmen.“I like the way Pakistan took up the challenge because these are alien conditions for Pakistan,” said Raja.“Ghulam had energy, attitude and a game plan. Forget about the last shot, until then he knew what to do on this surface. He showed good strong body language and he was not afraid to eyeball the South Africans.” Stay informed with The Namibian – your source for credible journalism.

    "title": "22-year-old left brain dead from ‘days-long brutal torture’ in AL prison, lawsuit says",
    "text": "By Natalie Demaree ,\n6 hours ago\nThe family of a 22-year-old father who died while serving a year-long sentence in an Alabama prison filed a lawsuit against prison and corrections department officials, accusing them of failing to protect the man from inmate-on-inmate abuse.\nDaniel Williams “was left brain dead” and died Nov. 9, 2023 — the same day set for his release — after “days-long brutal torture” by another inmate at the Staton Correctional Facility in Elmore, about a 15-mile drive north of Montgomery, the lawsuit said.\n“Within days of reaching that time of when he would be free, he was held against his will for roughly three days, sexually assaulted, raped during that time, numerous times, had restraint marks and beat nearly to the point of unconscious,” Callee Mendenhall, one of the attorneys representing the family, told WKRG. “In fact, when they did find him, he was unconscious .”\nMcClatchy News reached out to the Alabama Department of Corrections, which operates the correctional facility, for comment Dec. 19 but did not immediately receive a response.\nWilliams’ death “I’m coming home better then I was before drug free it’s been a crazy ride 3 different prisons now. It’s almost over,” Williams wrote in a Facebook post days before the alleged abuse began Oct. 19, according to the lawsuit.\nThen, on Oct. 22, a prison warden contacted Williams’ family and told them he had overdosed on drugs, the lawsuit said.\nBut when the family arrived at the hospital, they found Williams had been beaten severely, the lawsuit said.\n“He had bruises, cuts; there was indentions in his head , looked like a mop handle went across his head a couple of times,” Williams’ father, Terry Williams, told NBC News. “Before he even got to the hospital, he was already gone.”\nInmates and investigations later revealed that Williams was beaten, assaulted and forced to consume drugs while being held hostage in a housing dormitory by another inmate, according to the lawsuit, which said at least two other inmates “acted in concert” in Williams’ death.\nDuring this time, the lawsuit said “no headcounts of inmates in the open bay dormitories were conducted that would indicate an issue to the guards.”\nOn Oct. 22, an inmate reported the attacks on Williams to the guards, the lawsuit said. Williams was then found unconscious in the bed of an inmate who “has a notorious history of violent criminal acts” in the prison system, the lawsuit said.\nThe lawsuit accused the corrections department of failing to take disciplinary measures that would have kept Williams away from the other inmate.\n“I couldn’t save my son, but I want to save the next person,” Williams’ father told NBC.\nAlabama prison conditions A 2019 investigation of Alabama’s prisons by the Department of Justice revealed unconstitutional practices within the system.\nThe investigation found overcrowding and understaffing contributes to harmful conditions for prisoners. A year later, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the ADOC , accusing it of failing to “provide safe and sanitary conditions” for prisoners, according to a 2020 news release.\nDuring Williams’ time at the Staton Correctional Facility, the lawsuit said the same problems continued. According to the lawsuit, there were a recorded 1,394 inmates — roughly 275% more than the designed capacity of 508 men.\n“Alabama’s prison mortality rate is five times the national average,” the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice said in a 2023 report.\nAccording to data from the organization, 325 people died in Alabama prisons in 2023.\nAn internal investigation relating to Williams’ death is ongoing, according to the lawsuit.\nIf you have experienced sexual assault and need someone to talk to, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline for support at 1-800-656-4673 or visit the hotline's online chatroom .\nCorrectional officer sexually assaulted inmate at women’s prison, AL officials say\nPrison doctor laughed off inmate’s sexual abuse and asked for lunch date, Oregon suit says\nOfficers beat pretrial detainee to death in jail’s ‘blind spot’ as punishment, feds say",

    "text": "Usach-Technovation es un programa que busca impulsar el interés de niñas y adolescentes por las carreras STEM (ciencia, tecnología, ingeniería y matemáticas) a través del desarrollo de nuevas tecnologías y la innovación digital. Además, establece una vinculación temprana con estas áreas, promoviendo el aumento de mujeres en las ingenierías.\nEl pasado sábado 6 de abril se llevó a cabo una jornada inaugural masiva en la Facultad de Ingeniería. Asistieron las participantes, junto a sus padres y madres, y al equipo de la Facultad.\nEn la oportunidad se presentó Usach-Technovation y el público conoció al robot humanoide ATOM; luego las niñas y adolescentes se dirigieron a su primera clase.\nLa jornada inaugural fue un éxito rotundo y marcó el inicio de una experiencia enriquecedora para las participantes del programa que se ejecutará en tres cohortes anuales: un bootcamp de verano y dos talleres, uno en cada semestre.\nEn el primer semestre, el programa se desarrollará durante once sábados y contará con 74 participantes de entre 13 y 17 años. Durante este periodo, las aprenderán a programar y desarrollar habilidades tecnológicas para abordar un problema en su entorno, utilizando los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) como marco de referencia. Culminará con la creación de una aplicación para celular que busca resolver dicho problema.\nEsta iniciativa no solo promueve el desarrollo tecnológico, sino que también contribuye a derribar las barreras de género y fomenta la participación activa de las mujeres en las STEM.\nEl decano de la Facultad de Ingeniería, Dr. Cristian Vargas Riquelme, destacó que la participación de las niñas en áreas STEM no solo contribuye a su desarrollo individual, sino que también promueve la diversidad y el progreso en nuestra sociedad. \"Incentivamos así un aumento en la representación de las mujeres en las ingenierías\", subrayó.\nPor su parte, la directora Estratégica Informática de la Universidad de Santiago, Dra. Carolina Bonacic Castro, resaltó el impacto positivo que programas como Technovation Girls tienen en las participantes y en la sociedad en general. \"Estas instancias permiten a las alumnas comprender el proceso de resolución de problemas tecnológicos y su impacto en la sociedad\", señaló.\nJunto a Technovation Girls, la Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Santiago de Chile reafirmó su compromiso con la promoción de la igualdad de género y el desarrollo tecnológico en nuestro país.\nRevisa a continuación el registro audiovisual de la jornada:",

    "text": "UNCF (United Negro College Fund) celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2024. As a major event during a year-long celebration, UNCF will host its annual New England “A Mind Is…” Gala on Thursday, March 7, from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Seaport Hotel Boston. More than 300 business, community and civic leaders are expected to attend. Since 1944, UNCF has strived to change the historically Black college and university (HBCU) narrative across the nation by equipping more HBCU students with the resources necessary to transition into college, graduate and ultimately establish careers that will enable better futures for us all. The New England “A Mind Is…” Gala will recognize outstanding partners who help the organization effectuate this mission. UNCF will present the “Leadership Award” to Bob Rivers, CEO and chair of the board of directors, Eastern Bank, for his commitment to providing community resources that are inclusive to all; the “Leadership Award” to Keon Holmes, CFA, managing director, Cambridge Associates, for his commitment to ensuring more talented minorities have a lighted pathway to the asset management industry; and the “Lifetime Achievement Award” to Dr. N. Anthony and Mrs. Robyn Coles for their commitment to advancing Black educational and economic mobility. Proceeds from the gala will support UNCF-member HBCUs and college students from New England and across the United States. Entertainment for the night will be provided by Brandon Victor Dixon, an Emmy®, Grammy® (2x) and Tony® (2x) award-nominated actor and producer. Shayna Seymour, co-anchor of WCVB's iconic nightly newsmagazine, “Chronicle,” will serve as the mistress of ceremonies for the evening. “Since our founding in 1944, UNCF has fueled HBCUs with vital resources to educate generations of African American and other minority students,” said Dr. Michael L. Lomax, president and CEO, UNCF. “This year marks our 80th anniversary, and we’re focusing on ‘Honoring the Legacy, Transforming our Future.’ We gratefully acknowledge and celebrate our founders, donors and philanthropic partners from the last eight decades who have helped us make a difference for more than 500,000 graduates from our member HBCUs. To achieve greater successes for our community and this nation, we are working diligently to encourage and transform the next generation through education. Our students and institutions need ongoing support to empower that work. Events like our New England ‘A Mind Is…’ Gala help us do just that,” said Lomax. “For more than eight decades, UNCF has brought individuals of all backgrounds together to ensure that HBCUs and their students have access to a college education that prepares them to be leaders in our nation and serve as everyday heroes in their local communities,” said Diego Aviles, vice president, Northeast Division, UNCF. Current sponsors include gold sponsors, Black Economic Alliance, Boston Global Investors (BGI), Delta Air Lines, Eastern Bank, Santander, The Kraft Group and Wellington Management; silver sponsors, Cerevel and The Baupost Group; and bronze sponsors, Cambridge Associates, JP Morgan Chase, TJX Companies and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

    "text": "The second weekend of October will see changes compared to the weather of the last few days, with upheavals throughout the country. Colonel Mario Giuliacci reels off the weather forecast: “In the North the phase of bad weather will end, with the clouds already giving way to large clearings, while the last rains will wet the extreme North-East at the beginning of the day. On Saturday 12 October the temporary return of some showers is possible in Valle d’Aosta, Liguria and Piedmont, but overall the weekend will be dry and at times sunny in much of the North. Even in the central regions, the last part of the week will bring a prevalence of good weather, even if the days will be cooler”.\nBut it didn’t end here. Here’s what you read above meteogiuliacci.it : “In the South the change will concern not so much the conditions of the sky, which will be mostly clear or little cloudy, but rather the temperatures, which will be significantly decreasing almost everywhere. The anomalous heat of the last few days will thus give way to decidedly more autumnal temperatures, in many places below normal”.\n#Weather #change #goodbye #bad #weather #Giuliaccis #prediction #weekend #Tempo",

    "text": "Vox pide a Bellido que explique la pérdida de casi 10 millones de fondos europeos\nBadanelli critica que «se paguen intereses a los bancos para un proyecto que ni siquiera tiene un proyecto básico de ejecución»\nCórdoba Actualizada 16:55\nLa portavoz de Vox en el Ayuntamiento de Córdoba, Paula Badanelli, ha lamentado que un año más el Ayuntamiento tenga que devolver millones de euros de los fondos europeos que no han sido capaces de ejecutar, «ya en 2023 denunciamos que solo se había ejecutado el 80% del total perdiendo también millones de euros».\n«En este año ya han anunciado que van a tener que devolver cerca de un 40% del dinero, casi seis millones de euros que sumado a lo perdido en el ejercicio anterior por el Gobierno del PP suman nueve millones de euros».\nPaula Badanelli ha tachado de «escandalosa» la situación y ha puesto sobre la masa la «falta de respeto del gobierno de Bellido por el dinero público, y vemos en los plenos modificaciones de crédito que nadie sabe a dónde van». Además ha puesto en relieve la «incompetencia y la irresponsabilidad del gobierno del PP, hablamos de casi diez millones de euros que devuelven porque no han sido capaces de gastar»\nA esto, hay que añadir, según Badanelli, «que el Ayuntamiento ha pedido préstamos a los bancos para licitar más de 20 millones de euros para inversiones» y ha criticado que «el gobierno del PP esté dejando escapar millones de euros cuando le pide préstamos a los bancos y cuando las cuentas corrientes del Ayuntamiento están más que saneadas, hay casi 150 millones de euros que el Gobierno municipal no es capaz de gastar».\nDinero sin proyectos\nLa portavoz municipal ha recalcado que «se paguen intereses a los bancos para un proyecto que ni siquiera tiene un proyecto básico de ejecución» y que «siendo los plazos de la administración larguísimos se termina de pagar el préstamo y el proyecto aún no está terminado, no está proyectado en la ciudad».\nPor último, Paula Badanelli ha lamentado el negocio que supone esto para los bancos mientras que «el alcalde Bellido sigue asfixiando a las familias cordobesas con subidas de impuestos o bajadas pírricas del 0,1%. Nos preguntamos dónde está el alcalde, más centrado en su proyección personal que en hacer de alcalde» y ha terminado diciendo que «desde Vox, vamos a estar encima de todo esto, vamos a denunciar cada cosa por mucho que haya a quien no le guste porque el dinero público es sagrado, un gobierno debe ser eficaz y cuidar cada euro, con menos impuestos, más eficiencia y más inversiones en las calles en lugar de más dinero en la cuenta corriente y más negocio para los bancos».",
