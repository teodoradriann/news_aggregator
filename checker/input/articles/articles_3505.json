    "title": "Vietnam's Ambitious Plan: Securing Energy Future through Coal Production",
    "text": "In an unprecedented move to secure the nation's energy future, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has enacted a directive that mandates the Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries Group (Vinacomin) along with other relevant bodies to guarantee the provision of adequate coal supplies for power production. This decree, aimed at bolstering the stability of electricity supply, underscores the critical juncture at which Vietnam finds itself in the quest for sustainable and reliable energy sources.\nSteering Towards Energy Security\nAt the heart of this directive is Vinacomin's commitment to ramp up coal production to approximately 37.4 million tonnes by 2024, marking a modest increase from the current year's output. This strategic move is not just about meeting immediate energy needs but is a clear signal of Vietnam's broader ambitions to fortify its energy reserves against future uncertainties. Alongside this production boost, Vinacomin is poised to channel VND25.5 trillion into the State budget, consume 50 million tonnes of coal, export 1.4 million tonnes, and generate a significant 10.5 billion kWh of electricity. These projections are not just numbers but represent a multifaceted approach to energy management that balances domestic consumption with global market engagement.\nBreaking New Ground\nTo realize these ambitious targets, Vinacomin is set to navigate through a maze of investment procedure challenges. The corporation plans to enhance its production capacity by harnessing advanced technology and embarking on coal exploration ventures. This includes securing land leases and pushing forward restructuring projects that align with the national energy and electricity development plans. Moreover, Vinacomin's initiative to import 14.3 million tonnes of coal for electricity underscores a pragmatic approach to supplementing domestic coal reserves with international sources, ensuring that the nation's power plants remain well-fueled.\nInnovation at the Core\nUnderpinning Vinacomin's strategy is a profound commitment to innovation and technological advancement. By adopting cutting-edge production technologies, focusing on research and development in the realms of alumina and aluminium, and steering a comprehensive digital transformation project, Vinacomin is not just preparing for the future; it is actively shaping it. These initiatives are geared towards increasing efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and ultimately, securing Vietnam's position as a leader in sustainable energy production.\nIn essence, the directive signed by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is more than a mere administrative order. It is a vision for Vietnam's energy future, one that rests on the pillars of sustainability, innovation, and security. By marshalling the collective efforts of Vinacomin and other stakeholders, Vietnam is taking bold steps towards not just meeting its energy needs but doing so in a manner that is environmentally responsible and economically viable. As the nation presses on with these efforts, the global community watches, perhaps seeing in Vietnam a model for energy management that other countries might someday follow.",

    "text": "Israeli 'aggression' targets Syrian air defence base: Report The attack near the airport came \"one whole day after the airport resumed flights,\" said the British-based monitor with a network inside Syria. Israel carried out an aerial strike targeting a main Syrian air defence base in southern Syria on Thursday in the latest bombing campaign since the outbreak of war in Gaza on Oct. 7, Syrian army and intelligence sources said. Citing a Syrian military source, state media had earlier said missile strikes coming from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had targeted several sites it did not identify. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) \"Our air defences confronted the (Israeli) aggressors' missiles and downed some of them with only material losses,\" a Syrian military source said. Reuters could not independently verify the report. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. Since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel has escalated its strikes on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria and also struck Syrian army air defences and some Syrian forces. The strikes are believed to have targeted a Syrian army air defence base and a radar station in the Tel al-Sahn area in the Sweida province in southwestern Syria, according to a Syrian military intelligence source and another regional security official familiar with the matter. Last month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding. \"Tehran is stepping up its efforts to provide Syria with air defence systems that can potentially erode of the effectiveness of Israeli strikes,\" said another regional military source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \"This is related to the Gaza war calculations in the event of the conflict spreading,\" he added. Israel has for years carried out attacks on what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria, where Tehran's influence has grown since it began supporting President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war that started in 2011. The strikes are part of an escalation of what has been a low-intensity conflict with a goal of slowing Iran's growing entrenchment in Syria, Israeli military experts say. Fighters allied with Iran, including Hezbollah, now hold sway in vast areas in eastern, southern and northwestern Syria and in several suburbs around the capital.

    "text": "SINCLAIR, Maine ( WAGM /Gray News) - Officials said a product many people use was the cause of an explosion that took place in Maine on Saturday. The Maine Fire Marshal’s Office said the explosion in Sinclair was caused by propane, with the gas igniting and leading to mass destruction in a neighborhood. Barabra Deschaine said she was at home when her neighbor’s house exploded. “I heard a boom and I felt like the floor was going to cave into the cellar and the roof was going to fall in on top of me,” she said. “I looked out the window, and there was debris flying all over.” The Fire Marshal’s Office said the propane explosion sent debris across the street, into the nearby lakes and onto the rooftops of neighboring buildings. Deschaine’s home was damaged when debris from the explosion blew through the walls of the garage. Windows were blown out in other neighboring buildings. Another residence caught fire before it was destroyed. “We’re fortunate that so many fire departments came to help because it could have been a lot worse,” Deschaine said. Propane is a gas people commonly use and have in their homes. Although it is used daily, it can be dangerous if used incorrectly. Propane leaks can happen for many reasons, including valves left open, old tanks used, or pressure changes, among other reasons. When a leak happens, the gas can give off a distinct smell. However, even with the distinct smell, North Lakes Deputy Fire Chief Derrick Ouellette said the gas may not be noticed. “Propane is heavier in the air so it tends to lie in low places so sometimes it is hard to detect,” he said. Ouellette said there are other ways to watch for a propane leak if the smell cannot be detected. “If your consumption has gone up and you haven’t used any more than usual, there’s a sign right there,” he said. He recommends that people who use propane also use propane gas detectors as a precaution. Copyright 2024 WAGM via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "A fruitful business: Pick-your-own-produce farms harvest new revenue streams in growing agritourism industry",
    "text": "MCKINNEY, Texas — The summer harvesting season may be over at Pure Land Farm in McKinney, but the work never stops for owners Jack and Megan Neubauer. It's early July, and Jack is spraying his blackberry crop with hydrogen peroxide at the pick-your-own-produce farm. The plants’ leaves tend to grow fungus if they’re not treated like this -- and, as one of the farm’s biggest customer draws, the blackberries must look as good as they taste. As the father-daughter duo braves the midday heat, they do what they can to ensure a plentiful crop for next year’s customers, who are willing to do their own manual labor for the organic produce. Pure Land Farm, and the owners and customers at the center of the pick-your-own-produce operation, are helping sow the seeds of an increasing agritourism trend in North Texas. \"Agritourists are the kind of people who are willing to come out and sweat because they value organic, local fruits and vegetables and farmers,\" Megan said. Agritourism, simply put, is the intersection between agriculture and tourism. If a business brings visitors to an agricultural production or nature site for an experience, it counts as agritourism, according to Connor Clark, an assistant professor at Texas A&M AgriLife . Beyond pick-your-own-produce farms, the industry includes everything from pumpkin patches to wildlife safaris to Christmas tree farms. The worldwide agritourism market was valued at $33.8 billion in 2022. A projection by Allied Market Research expects it to reach $111.1 billion by 2032. For Jack and Megan, agritourism means a way to profit from their farm. Pure Land Farm's roots were planted in 2012, a year after Jack purchased the land following his retirement from a career in petroleum engineering. At first, the Neubauers started selling their farm's produce -- zucchinis, onions, peppers, garlic and more -- at area farmers markets. According to Megan, these markets were an easy place to build a following, but their sales weren’t profitable enough to sustain the farm on their own. In 2017, Pure Land Farm added berries to their harvest with the intent of switching their business to a pick-your-own-produce model. “Pick-your-own has been such a game-changer because it has eliminated so much of the backside of the labor for us,” Megan said. “We’re able to repurpose all of the time that we’ve saved picking, sorting, bagging and all of the stuff that people don’t realize is days of work before a farmers market.” Agritourism helps small businesses like ranches and farms diversify their income in a changing agriculture industry, Clark explained. Any number of challenges -- fluctuating market prices, climate change, labor costs and so on -- can impact the livelihood of farmers. “Whether it’s horseback-riding or a birding tour or a you-pick farm, being able to incorporate that income into an agricultural operation can not only help and make a difference, but even be a massively profitable model,” Clark said. For the Alford Family Farm in Emory, they’ve been taking the changes in stride. The family-run operation began 12 years ago when husband and wife Tom and Patty Alford bought the land. While their main crop is berries in the spring and summer, Tom and Patty’s son Michael Alford said the farm’s income is supplemented during the offseason by pecan harvests and bonsai tree profits. Much like the Neubauers, the Alfords' business was initially reliant on farmers market sales and has since shifted to incorporate a pick-your-own model. Unlike the Neubauers, the Affords do still regularly sell some produce at the Denton Farmers Market. Their business model transition happened during the pandemic when Michael said their pick-your-own-berries business \"exploded\" once the Alfords -- and, more important, their customers -- realized that picking fruits on a five-acre field made was a perfect social distancing activity. “The farmers markets had more rules, and it was kind of hard to find people to run it with all of the government subsidies that everyone was getting,” Michael said. “It was also harder to get customers to the farmers markets. But we had people out here looking to get out of their house.” Clark said this is part of a consumer trend seen all across the agritourism industry since the pandemic. People who could no longer travel long distances for tourist experiences began looking in their own backyards. It’s also represents a cultural shift in interest, he said. “People like getting out, connecting with nature and connecting with more traditional ways of life,” Clark said. “It really sparked something interesting in people, and that trend seems to be going strong. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic over, this is absolutely projected to keep growing.” Even before COVID-19, farm agritourism revenue more than tripled from 2007 to 2012, according to data from the Census of Agriculture. This sharp growth doesn’t just mean a chance to increase the profits and popularity for the team at Pure Land Farm. It’s also a chance, the Neubauers said, to connect their community with their food. “The real benefits are in bringing people out, letting them get their hands dirty, letting them feel what it’s like for people who are growing their food,” Megan said. “The more people we can connect back to actual agriculture by providing the space for them to have this experience, it’s just going to spread.”",

Nun gibt es eine Einigung. Wie sieht sie aus?\nMurr - Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nDie Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: „Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.“\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert. dpa",
