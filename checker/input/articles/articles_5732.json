    "title": "US accuses Nigerian CEO of obstructing investigation into a US$20M fraud case",
    "text": "In a significant legal development, the US government has expanded its case against Allen Onyema, the CEO of Nigeria’s largest airline, Air Peace, with new charges related to obstruction of justice. The indictment comes amidst an ongoing investigation into previous allegations of bank fraud and money laundering involving Onyema and another senior executive of the airline, Ejiroghene Eghagha. Both executives have denied all charges, but the expanded accusations have cast a shadow over one of Africa’s most prominent airlines. Onyema’s legal troubles first emerged in 2019 when the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia indicted him on charges of bank fraud and money laundering. These charges stemmed from allegations that Onyema had orchestrated the transfer of over $20 million from Nigeria to the US through fraudulent letters of credit. Prosecutors alleged that the money was moved under the guise of purchasing aircraft for Air Peace, using falsified documents from companies that Onyema controlled. Additionally, US authorities accused him of laundering $16 million of the fraudulent proceeds. However, the new indictment escalates the legal situation, adding charges of obstruction of justice. According to US prosecutors, Onyema attempted to impede the investigation by submitting falsified documents in an effort to dismiss the charges. Specifically, the US Attorney’s Office stated that Onyema had engaged in “obstruction of justice by submitting false documents to the government.” These actions, prosecutors claim, were part of a broader strategy to derail the investigation into his alleged financial misdeeds. This development has not only increased the legal pressure on Onyema but has also raised questions about the broader implications for Air Peace and its operations. Alongside Onyema, Air Peace’s Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, also faces charges related to the case. Eghagha was initially indicted in 2019 for bank fraud and aggravated identity theft, and the recent charges have expanded her alleged involvement in the scheme. US prosecutors argue that Eghagha played a critical role in facilitating the fraudulent transactions by helping to process and manage the falsified documents that enabled the illegal transfers. Both Onyema and Eghagha maintain their innocence, and their legal teams have strongly contested the charges, arguing that the US government has misrepresented the facts of the case. However, the addition of obstruction of justice charges has intensified the spotlight on the executives and raised doubts about the resolution of the case. Despite the mounting legal challenges, Air Peace has moved swiftly to reassure its customers and stakeholders that its day-to-day operations remain unaffected. In a statement, the airline emphasized that the legal proceedings will not impact its “safety, reliability, or day-to-day operations,” underscoring the company’s commitment to maintaining business as usual. The airline further stressed that “while the charges have been expanded, it is essential to note that both Dr. Onyema and Mrs. Eghagha remain innocent, and these are mere allegations, as the case is still in court.” Air Peace’s legal team is reportedly “fully engaged with the matter” and “working tirelessly to ensure that justice prevails.” The airline’s decision to address the allegations publicly highlights the importance of mitigating reputational damage, especially in an industry where customer trust is crucial. Air Peace, which has grown to become one of the largest airlines in Africa, operates numerous domestic and international routes, and any disruption to its operations could have significant implications for the region’s aviation sector. The legal case against Onyema and Eghagha is poised to be a long and drawn-out affair, with both sides preparing for an extended court battle. The US government, having expanded its case, is likely to pursue aggressive legal action, while the defense is expected to challenge the new charges on procedural and factual grounds. The obstruction of justice charge is a serious one, as it suggests that Onyema not only committed financial crimes but also sought to actively cover them up. If convicted, the penalty for obstruction of justice can be severe, potentially carrying significant prison time and financial penalties. Additionally, the charges of bank fraud and money laundering, if proven, could result in the forfeiture of assets and further penalties, compounding the legal and financial risks for Onyema. Onyema’s legal team will likely argue that the government’s case is built on a misinterpretation of the facts, as they have previously denied all allegations. The defense may seek to question the validity of the evidence presented by US prosecutors, particularly the claim that Onyema and Eghagha used falsified documents to transfer funds out of Nigeria. The case against Onyema has broader implications, not just for the individuals involved but also for Nigeria’s business community and the African aviation industry. Onyema, as the CEO of one of Nigeria’s largest and most successful airlines, has been seen as a leading figure in the country’s private sector. His legal troubles may have a chilling effect on Nigerian businesses with international ties, especially those that rely on cross-border transactions. For the aviation industry, particularly in Africa, the case has raised concerns about the financial transparency and regulatory oversight of airlines operating in the region. Air Peace has been a trailblazer in the African market, expanding routes and offering affordable flights in a sector that has often been plagued by inefficiencies and financial struggles. If the legal challenges against the airline’s leadership intensify, it could impact investor confidence and the long-term viability of the airline. As the case against Allen Onyema and Ejiroghene Eghagha continues to unfold, its potential impact on Air Peace and the broader Nigerian business community remains uncertain. The obstruction of justice charges have added a new layer of complexity to an already contentious legal battle, and it remains to be seen how the case will develop in court. For now, Air Peace maintains its operations, but the reputational and financial risks loom large as the legal proceedings move forward. Both Onyema and Eghagha have vowed to fight the charges, and the outcome of this case could have long-lasting consequences for Nigeria’s aviation sector and its standing in the global business community.",

    "text": "Understanding educational psychology: Harnessing AI for holistic learning\nAs we mark the International Day of Education 2025, it is clearer than ever that along with the traditional methods of teaching, integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in Bangladesh's education system can bring about great improvements. AI has been growing rapidly, and it has the power to create a revolution in the education sector. The use of AI-driven education can play a pivotal role in bridging the gap where quality education is still inaccessible to people.\nThrough the implementation of AI, access to quality educational resources can be ensured, irrespective of the students' geographical location or socio-economic background. AI-driven platforms can assist rural educators by showing them new ways of teaching and best practices from around the world. If implemented in an innovative way, AI can empower the educators rather than replace them. Here the word \"innovative' means adopting technological amenities in relation to the needs of the learners. To do this successfully, educators need to understand educational psychology.\nEach student learns and develops differently. Educational psychology strives to understand behaviour, cognition and emotional needs to determine how education can be delivered in the best possible way. AI has powerful tools to advance educational psychology by determining students' specific needs, assessing behavioural patterns, and designing suitable interventions to achieve development. For instance, students who have disabilities like dyslexia or ADHD can learn much better with the AI tools that cover their specific needs.\nAI-based adaptive learning systems have the power to redefine classroom learning to suit different sets of needs among learners by using different lesson plans, teaching styles, and even modes of assessment. Virtual tutors can also aid teachers, particularly in understaffed regions. Since AI can analyse data in real-time, it is possible to monitor engagement learning outcomes and detect patterns in students' behaviour.\nMoreover, by tailoring training modules to teachers' current skills and knowledge, these platforms help educators improve their teaching methods and stay updated with educational developments. These personalised academic resources can ensure that no learner is left behind. AI applications such as interactive games and quizzes encourage inclusion as they are more supportive of students with disabilities.\nHowever, when we look at the other side of the coin, we have to realise that AI is bound to raise issues related to over-dependence, privacy and mental well-being. Over-dependence can result in a lack of creativity and critical thinking skills, both of which are an essential part of being a human. Additionally, unnecessary use of the computer can have negative implications for the mental and physical health of students. It also makes them stray away from forming human connections.\nIn my position as an educator, I subscribe to the idea of AI's balanced application. AI should be embraced in schools as an enhancement tool rather than a replacement for human interaction. Teachers should continue to be at the core, building rapport with students.\nTo utilise AI in a way where students can benefit from it, schools need to take some measures to ensure student well-being is still their priority. To do so, institutions need to establish clear policies on the ethical use of AI, prioritise data privacy and limit screen time. At an educational level, particular sets of skills where AI usage is effective should also be fostered, always with the human-centred approach. Schools need to combine AI with other activities aimed towards fostering creativity, critical thinking, and social skill building. By making sure these tools are available to everyone no matter what part of the country they belong to, we can make sure it doesn't broaden the educational gap and learning losses.\nOn this International Day of Education, let's pledge together to utilise AI in a responsible, inclusive way, which has the potential to change the way students learn in the classroom.\nThe author is the Principal of Glenrich International School, Uttara",

    "text": "以伊战争暴击全球股市？华尔街大佬：影响很快结束，关注经济本身！\n财联社6月19日讯（编辑 黄君芝）自以伊冲突上周五升级以来，全球多国股市大跌。但根据金融服务公司LPL Financial首席股票策略师Jeff Buchbinder的说法，全球股市很快就会拜托这场战争的影响。\n美东时间周三，Buchbinder在接受最新采访时指出，经济状况对市场表现的影响往往大于地缘政治事件。\n“如果你认真思考，就会发现经济增长和企业利润才是真正推动市场走高的原因。”他说。\nBuchbinder以第一次海湾战争和“911袭击”为例，说明市场反应往往与经济形势有关，而不是与战争本身有关。\n他进一步解释称，“在1990年第一次海湾战争期间，市场在那段时期的抛售幅度略高于10%，但那是一个具有挑战性的经济时期。我们认为，疲软更多是由于储蓄和贷款危机带来的经济环境，而不是对中东冲突恶化的担忧。”\nBuchbinder还称，袭击将得到控制，不会像最初担心的那样严重影响油价。上周五，以色列对伊朗核设施和军事设施发动了史无前例的袭击，导致全球油价飙升。当天，WTI原油期货;)收涨超7%至每桶71.5美元；布伦特原油期货;)收涨近9%至每桶75.5美元。\n“美国现在实现了能源独立。石油危机不会对经济或企业利润产生太大的影响，所以我认为这就是为什么你会看到这个市场对这一事件的抵抗力要强得多。”他补充说。\n不过Buchbinder也强调，这确实可能会像过去的其他地缘政治事件一样持续数月。\n他指出，911事件发生在互联网泡沫破裂、2001年经济衰退和安然丑闻之后。他将这些经济事件归咎于市场低迷，而不是恐怖袭击本身。\n“你可以把这些抛售与那个时期和那些经济事件联系起来。”他说。\nBuchbinder还研究了1941年日本偷袭珍珠港后的市场反应。他表示，标准普尔500指数;)在珍珠港事件发生一年后上涨了约11.5%，在上世纪60年代初古巴导弹危机发生一年后上涨了32%。他说，从历史上看，股市在经历创伤性地缘政治事件后具有弹性。\n因此他认为，中东战争可能会导致短期市场低迷，但如果得到相对控制，市场可能会迅速复苏。他说，投资者应该关注经济增长和企业利润，不要让情绪左右投资决策。\n“这是一个激动人心的时刻。我们不希望情绪影响我们的投资决策，但如果你回顾历史，只要你没有陷入衰退或即将陷入衰退，股市实际上都能很好地应对这些事件。”他说。\n责任编辑：于健 SF069",
