The variant, located in a mitochondrial microprotein dubbed SHLP2, was found to be highly protective against Parkinson’s disease; individuals with this mutation are half as likely to develop the disease as those who do not carry it. The variant form of the protein is relatively rare and is found primarily in people of European descent. The findings appear on January 3, 2024, in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. First discovered by Pinchas Cohen at the USC Leonard Davis School in 2016, SHLP2 is made within the cell’s mitochondria. Previous research from the Cohen Lab established that SHLP2 is associated with protection from aging-related diseases including cancer and that levels of the microprotein change in patients with Parkinson’s disease; they rise as the body attempts to counteract the pathology of Parkinson's disease but often fail to mount additional production as the disease progresses. This latest finding builds upon the USC team’s prior mitochondrial research and represents an advance at the intersection of longevity science, precision health, and microprotein discovery. “This study advances our understanding of why people might get Parkinson's and how we might develop new therapies for this devastating disease,” said Cohen, professor of gerontology, medicine and biological sciences and senior author of the study. “Also, because most research is done on well-established protein-coding genes in the nucleus, it underscores the relevance of exploring mitochondrial-derived microproteins as a new approach to the prevention and treatment of diseases of aging.” The research team was able to use targeted mass spectrometry techniques to identify the tiny peptide’s presence in neurons and found that SHLP2 specifically binds to an enzyme in mitochondria called mitochondrial complex 1. This enzyme is essential for life, and declines in its function have been linked not only to Parkinson’s disease but also to strokes and heart attacks. “Our data highlights the biological effects of a particular gene variant and the potential molecular mechanisms by which this mutation may reduce the risk for Parkinson’s disease,” said Kim. “These findings may guide the development of therapies and provide a roadmap for understanding other mutations found in mitochondrial microproteins.” Reference: Newly discovered genetic mutation protects against Parkinson’s disease and offers hope for new therapies; Molecular Psychiatry, DOI:10.1038/s41380-023-02344-0",

    "text": "Paris Olympics organisers were on Thursday investigating the crowd trouble during a chaotic football match between Argentina and Morocco that marred the opening day of sport at the Games. Argentinas football association meanwhile called for action following the defeat for its mens side on Wednesday. The Moroccans beat two-time gold medallists Argentina 2-1 in Saint-Etienne at the end of a game mired in confusion and crowd trouble. Argentina thought they had salvaged a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of injury time as the game went on even beyond the 15 extra minutes indicated by officials. Also Read:Clay queen Iga Swiatek eyes gold; Djoko, Rafa could meet in Rd 2 But crowd trouble ensued, with projectiles launched onto the pitch and spectators invading the playing area. A firecracker was thrown at the Argentina bench. The players were taken off, before reappearing nearly two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium by now emptied of spectators. Medinas goal was then disallowed for offside following a VAR review, and Morocco held on for the win. The football match between Argentina and Morocco at the Saint-Etienne Stadium was suspended due to a pitch invasion by a small number of spectators, said Paris 2024 organisers in a statement. Argentina coach Javier Mascherano called the incidents and the resulting confusion a scandal and complained that we had a million things thrown at us. The Argentine FA said they had made a formal complaint to FIFAs disciplinary committee so that the necessary measures are taken for such a serious incident. There is a pressing need to guarantee the security of those involved so that this beautiful sport can be played in peace, the statement added.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD: An Accountability Court on Thursday fixed January 4 for the indictment of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana corruption reference. The Accountability Court judge, Muhammad Bashir, while hearing the case at Adiala jail set January 4 to frame the charge against Khan and his wife in the Toshakhana case. National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi and members of PTI’s legal team appeared before the court. During the hearing, copies of the reference and other necessary documents have been provided to the accused. The court adjourned the hearing of the case on January 4. The anti-graft watchdog filed the reference against Khan and his wife on December 21. Khan was disqualified on October 21, 2022, from the National Assembly for five years by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after he was found guilty of concealing facts about selling expensive gifts. According to the NAB, the inquiry proceedings have revealed that as former prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan was presented with 108 gifted state assets, out of the same, 58 gifted state assets were retained by Khan. He did not deposit the gifted state assets in Toshakhana for fair price assessment in contravention of rules and subsequently retained said gifted state items worth millions of rupees, it says. The gifted state assets were retained without fair price assessment for your benefit,it said, adding that moreover, Khan sold/misappropriated some of the gifted state assets for personal benefit. The NAB said that investigation proceedings further revealed that during Bushra Bibi being the wife of ex-PM, received gifts from foreign dignitaries amounting to millions of rupees and retained these gifts against a meager retention cost based on under value assessment/appraisement.

    "text": "Sophie Chauveau a pris le meilleur sur la Suédoise Hanna Oberg pendant son relais à Oberhof, ce dimanche. Tobias Schwarz/AFP\nVoilà un week-end parfait pour le biathlon français féminin. Après les victoires de Julia Simon et de Justine Braisaz-Bouchet en poursuite et en sprint, les Françaises se sont adjugé leur premier relais 4 x 6 km de la saison, ce dimanche, en Coupe du monde, à Oberhof (Allemagne). Les deux coureuses, accompagnées par Lou Jeanmonnot et Sophie Chauveau, ne disputaient que leur troisième relais ensemble après ceux d’Östersund (5e) et Hochfilzen (3e) en décembre.\nLou Jeanmonnot concluait le premier relais en milieu de peloton. Ensuite, Justine Braisaz-Bouchet remontait en deuxième position derrière la Suède, dont l’avance se stabilisait à une dizaine de secondes. La Tricolore, leader du classement général, ratait trois de ses tirs, mais elle parvenait à refaire son retard avec brio pour passer en première position. Partie en troisième relayeuse, Sophie Chauveau – qui avait décroché son premier podium en Coupe du monde vendredi – donnait aux Bleues une avance confortable grâce à un sang-froid remarquable au tir.\nUne saison magistrale La victoire des Françaises se dessinait un peu plus lorsque Julia Simon ne ratait aucun de ses cinq premiers tirs. Les bourrasques de vent pénalisaient un peu plus la Française lors de ses dernières tentatives, mais elle repartait tout de même avec 12 secondes d’avance sur la Norvégienne Ingrid Landmark Tandrevold au moment du dernier tour. Une avance maintenue durant les derniers hectomètres. La Norvège et la Suède complètent le podium.\nLes Françaises sont impériales cette saison puisque, courses individuelles et relais confondus (hors relais mixtes), elles ont remporté huit des 13 épreuves disputées. Tout l’inverse des hommes, qui éprouvent d’énormes difficultés, en atteste leur septième place du relais masculin, ce dimanche, à quatre minutes des Norvégiens.",

    "text": "Marcela Tinayre se mantuvo fiel a su estilo sin filtro y decidió contar lo que vive con su hijo . Se trata de Nacho Viale , el mayor del clan, quien acaba de sufrir una pérdida importante en su vida y tiene a todos los integrantes de su familia conmovidos por su sufrimiento.\nEn diálogo con Vero Lozano , la hija de Mirtha Legrand contó que Nacho perdió a su querida mascota y se encuentra devastado por la situación. Respecto a ese dolor en particular, la famosa confesó: «Si fuese a terapia el tema que llevaría es la tristeza de ver a un hijo que sufre porque muere alguien tan importante como su perro».\n«La verdad es que estoy angustiadísima con ese tema, la gente que tiene perros lo va a entender claramente», relató Marcela Tinayre en el ciclo de entrevistas de Telefe. «Yo también eh, murió del golpe, no era tan grande, venía todos los días a mi casa. Roco, a mi hijo más chico, le digo Nacho porque estoy tan obsesionada… por eso llevaría el tema», continuó la famosa. «Eso es una muestra de la gran madre que sos», acotó Vero Lozano para concluir con el tema.\nOpinó sin filtro En una de sus apariciones televisivas, Marcela Tinayre se refirió a sus múltiples proyectos laborales y no se privó de hablar de temas que están en el centro de la escena mediática. «Tengo muchos proyectos laborales y tan dispersos y absurdos», contó frente a las cámaras. «Hacer streaming en mañana, ser curadora de cine amateur en festivales de cine, me acordó mucho de mi tío José cuando me lo ofrecieron», sostuvo la conductora posterioemente.\n«También ser actriz y lo que creo que voy a hacer es hacer televisión en el verano, es una cosa que tengo muchas ganas de hacerlo, tuve muchas pérdidas y me rayé y dije ‘no trabajo este año y disfruto de otras cosas’», agregó la expresentadora de América TV y expuso sus motivos para tomarse un descanso de la pantalla chica luego de varios años continuos de actividad.\nPor otro lado, Marcela Tinayre no pudo evitar pronunciarse sobre la polémica del momento y se refirió al caso de una colega en el mundo de la farándula: «Yo creo que Tamara es un víctima de todo esto, por qué este tipo saca una cámara y la filma, ¿bajo qué criterio? Le deba haber vendido que estaba divorciado, por ahí shockea que sea en la Casa Rosada».\n? \"Como hija soy muy fiel\" Marcela Tinayre nos visita en #CortaPorLozano ??\n??
