    "text": "The two principal political protagonists were well defined, except when the 82-year-old President Biden decided against running for reelection against the 78-year-old Donald Trump who has returned to the fray after a gap of four years. Trump is Trump with a colourful record both as the President and as a person. Yet the Republicans thought of him as the more energetic and more populist candidate of the two who could win them back the White House. Biden was considered an ageing, tiring, senile and a forgetful candidate who had lost both his verve and his spright. The Presidents are usually the presumptive nominees if they have another term to contest. When Biden decided to withdraw it was unprecedented and hence a surprise, yet not a surprise because most on the Democrat side of the contest wished him to leave the field to someone who could have even or better chances to retain the White House. He was thus eulogised in laudable terms even as he was being kicked out of the running in what was being considered an almost certain defeat for the Democrats. Biden had turned into a sicker copy of himself and increasingly faltered on the global stage. Yet when he threw in the towel it was a day of bewilderment in political terms. Only on two earlier occasions in history had a sitting president decided not to seek another term. Biden had done well domestically, on the economic front and the USA has felt like a country on rails after the twin shocks of Covid and threatening recession. But with increasing age he had turned into a grandfather who could relate tricks from an old man's repertoire but was not the person that relatives wanted on display to visiting neighbours. It took quite an effort to convince him to withdraw. His wife and his close family though believed that in his bid for reelection stood the chance for their collective good. Equally amusingly, Dr Jill Biden, President's wife, was called for elderly abuse. (Pun was surely intended). Yet, it was the possibility of Trump's success in the election that became the trigger of concern on both sides of the aisle where some Republicans too openly beseeched the Democrats to review their nomination. Given the late state in the campaign it carried its own predicament, but a victorious Trump was a bigger risk. And this is why. Trump has declared that on Day-1 in his next tenure he will withdraw support to Ukraine which he feels has drained off billions of precious American dollars. If it implicitly delivers a victory to Putin with whom he claims an affable understanding and relationship so be it. America and 'making it great again' comes first to him. Without American support Ukraine and Zelenskyy has no legs to stand on against the superpower might of Russia. Ukraine till date has been collectively propped against Russia to keep Russia at bay from flexing its muscles in a newfound zeal to expand its perimeter of security against an encroaching NATO. From a deep state perspective, a Trump win would dislodge US' strategy. Trump's two other policy stands differ significantly from how policy gurus, 'deep state' thinkers and strategists prescribe: these relate to China and US policy on Israel. On Israel, Trump may not differ much except that he would ask Netanyahu to expedite the end game and use whatever will help him achieve that end. Trump's approach will put paid to the declared two-state policy that USA has publicly espoused and take an already obnoxious and dastardly war to even higher levels of intensity failing the morality test. With that will also go down the ultimate US aim to enable Israel the credibility needed to act as the minder of its interests in the ME failing to find US' proxy in the ME the desired eminence and acceptability. The design is grand enough to have withstood the tenures of both Trump and Biden. Trump would derail the entire effort. On China, Trump is far more aggressive than a revamped Biden who in his turn did not wish to appear a wimp after Trump in his first tenure had slapped tariffs and restrictions on China in a bid to slow and weaken its economy. Trump's affability towards Putin while attacking China on multifarious economic fronts was a typical recourse to super-power trinity games. Biden kept those pressures going only slowly relenting on some when faced with the reality of an imminent recession following Covid and global economic slowdown. While Biden kept a more offensive face on Russia, he tried working with China through his interlocutors to keep the economy improving globally and for the US. Trump's vow to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to the tune of 70 per cent to many in the US is a sure recipe to invite deepening recession. Inflation will be the other consequence slowing down American recovery and growth. Clearly American deep state is not in on this ride. Enter the Deep State. It needed Biden to abdicate his option for the second term and let Kamala Harris in as an establishment protégé. She will continue the policies of Biden aligned with American deep state objectives. Given this reading it may seem Harris has more than a fair chance to carry the November election while most odds are stacked against Trump despite his populist appeal - Republicans have their own set of anti-Trumpers who may simply abstain on the voting day or vote Harris is a few cases. All to keep Trump out. Yet it is the people who will decide the outcome. Deep state can only set the game up. What is deep state then? In bringing Biden to submit there was an unannounced but vehement pressure of the Democrat establishment. It constitutes of former Presidents, Democrat stalwarts and think-tanks who design Democrat policy and give it the words for enunciation. Just as there is a Republican establishment which feels to win back the White House, the pinnacle of American power, Trump is their best bet. Once in hand they can then force Trump to toe their line, they hope. Deep state sits over both establishments and has contributors and constituents from both sides in former Presidents, retired and serving CIA heads and deep state policy thinkers who keep above power politics to focus entirely on what is good for America. That it reflects what is genuinely good for the US, its people and retains American primacy in the world rarely varying from how a matter is largely perceived by the thinking quarters. The match-up in November is thus between Deep State/ Establishment appointee and Donald Trump's populism. The people will decide who wins.

    "text": "SEATTLE — REI CEO Eric Artz announced Thursday the company is laying off 357 employees as it braces for what's expected to be a \"challenging\" year ahead. [According to the message shared with employees](https://www.rei.com/newsroom/article/reductions-to-our-workforce), the layoffs will impact 200 people at headquarters, six from sales and customer support, 30 from experiences, meaning classes and trips, and 121 in distribution centers. No non-headquarters store-specific roles will be impacted. Artz said every employee whose job is eliminated will be getting separation benefits including severance, COBRA, and outplacement support and services. The coming days are going to be tough as we let go of a lot of good people,\" Artz said. \"We’re going to do everything we can to support them, but that will not make this moment any easier. The company added it does not plan to backfill recent leadership departures and instead will \"take the opportunity to right-size\" its senior leadership team to the needs of the business. Altogether, Artz said the company is reducing the size of its senior leadership team by 22% in 2024. Artz said the layoffs come as outdoor specialty retail has experienced major declines over the last four quarters and is continuing to worsen. \"While we were able to outperform this trend for much of the last year, it caught up to us in Q4 and we now expect conditions to remain very challenging throughout 2024,\" said Artz.

    "title": "Road To $10M: How Maxim Healthcare Services Completely Revamped Its Caregiver Benefits Package",
    "text": "Over the years, home-based care companies have thrown their weight behind\nenhanced benefits packages to attract more caregivers. Maxim Healthcare Services is one example of a company taking this effort to the next level.\nLast month, Maxim announced that it expanded its caregiver benefits program. The revamped benefits program is estimated to offer more than $10 million in added benefits.\nThe road to $10 million in added benefits began with Maxim’s employee survey. Every year, the company conducts a survey — known as the “voices of experience.”\n“Over the course of time, our caregivers have been telling us they want more,” Maxim Healthcare Services CEO Jarrod DePriest News. “They wanted more PTO. Generally, benefits seemed to be a common theme throughout our survey process.”\nThe Maryland-based Maxim Healthcare Services provides home health care, companion care and behavioral care services.\nThe response from the surveys led to Maxim putting together town halls with cohorts of caregivers across the country, which took place last fall.\n“We had 50 or 60 caregivers from four different parts of the country, and what we found talking to the caregivers directly, was that it wasn’t a one-size-fits-all approach,” DePriest said. “What’s important to caregiver A might be different from what’s important to caregiver B.”\nAfter these town halls, Maxim’s goal was to create a compelling caregiver benefits program that caught the attention of both job seekers and longtime employees.\nMaxim has changed its business model over the years. In the original business model, caregiver benefits were not always top of mind.\n“When I started with Maxim 26 years ago, we started as a staffing company,” DePriest said. “In 1993, we began to provide private-duty nursing. That was really our entrance into the home care setting. Because our origins were really staffing centric, we didn’t really have a robust benefit offering.”\nIn 2022, Maxim announced that it split its two business units into independently operated companies — Maxim Healthcare Services and Maxim Healthcare Staffing.\nIn order to catch up with the company’s evolution as a business, Maxim has enhanced its caregiver benefits package in a few ways. The company has increased its paid time off, almost doubling it.\nAdditionally, Maxim gave caregivers who work more than 2,000 hours a year the opportunity to choose between expanded PTO or cash bonuses, known as the company’s MaxCares program.\nPlus, the company implemented the ability for caregivers to set up a health savings account (HSA).\nThe company also offers an array of family care benefits, such as parental leave and more.\nWith all of these enhancements in place, Maxim is looking to measure what the impact will be on the company.\n“We’re definitely measuring both 90-day and 12-month retention rates for our caregivers,” DePriest said. “We’re also measuring if the benefit package that we’re rolling out is appealing enough to result in more time from people. Currently, roughly 10% to 15% of our total employees work 50% of the total hours every single week. By rolling out a better package, maybe we can gain more of their time, where they don’t have to split time with another employer or multiple employers.”\nUltimately, DePriest believes that the company is well positioned to continue improving the experience of its caregivers.\n“We don’t have to meet shareholders or Wall Street,” he said. “We really do get to make decisions based on what is going to be best for our patients and caregivers. This was a really great example of being able to focus on our mission, post-splitting the company, it’s just a natural next step.”",

    "text": "Windows “/>\nWindows‍ users are exposed to more than 600 million attacks every ⁤day,‌ with more than 99% of them related‌ to attempts to intercept⁣ passwords. As Day.Az reports, this was reported by the Anti-Malware​ portal with ⁢reference to the annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024.\nAccording to the study, the threat landscape is becoming increasingly ⁣complex as cybercriminals gain ‌access to new resources and tools,⁢ including artificial intelligence.\nParticular attention is paid to deepfake ⁣technology, ‌which ‍improves phishing schemes and allows you to create convincing resumes ⁢to penetrate‌ companies under the guise of applicants. Microsoft is⁣ emphasizing the ⁢need to use ‍better password policies or move away from passwords in favor ⁣of other authentication‌ methods.\nThe most attacked industries​ were IT (24% of all attacks), science and education (21%), as well as ​government agencies (12%). Thus, in the US healthcare system in the 2024 fiscal​ year, there were about 400 ⁣successful cyberattacks.\nIn addition, pro-government groups are ⁤becoming⁤ increasingly active, blurring the line ⁣between cybercriminals and government hackers. It is noted that government agencies often involve cybercriminals to participate in various operations, usually at the stages⁣ of reconnaissance and⁣ information collection.\nHow can individuals prepare for a career in rapidly evolving⁢ technology fields? Title: The Future of ⁣Technology: An Exclusive Interview with Tech Expert Dr. Jane Smith\nSetting: A sleek, modern⁤ meeting room adorned with vibrant tech-related artwork.

One aspect that caught my attention was the focus on ⁢AI ⁤integration within everyday tools. How do you think this will‌ impact industries beyond tech?\nDr. Jane Smith: Great question! AI has‌ the ‍potential to transform⁢ various sectors. In healthcare,‌ for instance, AI⁣ can analyze patient data more efficiently, leading to improved⁢ diagnostics ‍and personalized treatment plans. Similarly, in ⁢finance, we’re seeing AI streamline operations‍ and enhance risk assessments. The applications ‍really are limitless.\nAlex Thompson: ​ That’s fascinating! However, as we ⁢embrace these advancements, there are concerns regarding data privacy ‌and job displacement. How should companies like Microsoft ⁤address these challenges?\nDr. Jane Smith: ⁤ This⁣ is indeed⁣ a critical​ issue. Companies must​ prioritize transparency and ethical guidelines. Establishing robust data governance ⁢frameworks can help assuage privacy concerns. Regarding job displacement, it’s essential to focus on reskilling and upskilling the workforce. Technology should be viewed as a tool that enhances human capability rather than replaces it.\nAlex Thompson: I couldn’t agree ‍more. Speaking of enhancing human capability, do you believe the general public is ready to embrace ‍such advanced technology?\nDr. Jane Smith: It’s a mixed bag.

    "text": "В подмосковной Лобне начали строить современный производственно-логистический комплекс. Проект создаст более 750 новых рабочих мест. На территории появится масштабное здание из четырех корпусов с противопожарными перегородками. Общая площадь помещений составит 96 тыс. кв. метров.\nАрендаторы смогут разместить здесь склады, пищевые и фармацевтические производства, транспортные компании и другие предприятия. Доступны помещения от 2500 до 40000 кв. метров. В комплексе также предусмотрена офисная зона.\n«Мы создаем все необходимые технические условия. Комплекс получит пять мегаватт электроэнергии — это мощность уровня перерабатывающих заводов, в пять раз больше, чем в стандартных логистических парках», — пояснил Александр Гутекулов, руководитель департамента коммерческой недвижимости ГК «Михайловский Девелопмент».\nСейчас ведется первый этап строительства. Рабочие возводят два корпуса из четырех. На площадке задействованы 258 человек и 96 единиц техники, причем 70% оборудования работает круглосуточно.\nНесмотря на частые дожди, строители продолжают земляные работы. Внутри корпусов смонтировано освещение, в первом уже отделывают офисные помещения. Идет подготовка основания пола под бетонирование.\nПервую очередь комплекса планируют ввести в эксплуатацию в конце декабря 2025 года или сразу после новогодних праздников. Весь объект построят в три этапа.\nДобраться до нового комплекса удобно по Дмитровскому или Рогачевскому шоссе. В скором времени появится дополнительный подъезд — строящийся участок Северного обхода Лобни, который соединит трассу с микрорайоном Восточный.\nРанее сообщалось, что в Лобне снесли еще четыре незаконные торговые точки.",
