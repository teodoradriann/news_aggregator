    "text": "A quinta-feira (5) foi atípica no CT Joaquim Grava. O local, centro de treinamentos do [Corinthians](/futebol/time/_/id/874/corinthians), ao menos por um dia, foi tomado por estrangeiros e teve como idioma \"oficial\" o inglês. Isso porque o local foi cedido ao [Green Bay Packers](/nfl/time/_/nome/gb/green-bay-packers), que nesta sexta (6) encara o [Philadelphia Eagles](/nfl/time/_/nome/phi/philadelphia-eagles) na Neo Química Arena no primeiro jogo da história da [NFL](https://www.espn.com.br/nfl) no Brasil. E no mesmo local em que o técnico Ramón Diaz costuma dar entrevistas, quem falou dessa vez foi Matt LaFleur, treinador dos Packers. Bastante animado e empolgado, o comandante já iniciou sua coletiva falando português, desejando um bom dia a todos os presentes e citando a sua felicidade e orgulho com a oportunidade. \"Foi tudo muito receptivo, estamos ansiosos para fazer história amanhã. A comida, o povo, todo mundo muito animado com a experiência, estamos ansiosos para encontrar os fãs brasileiros. É uma grande honra estar aqui.\" LaFleur, que inicia sua quinta temporada à frente dos Packers, tem pela segunda vez a oportunidade de disputar um jogo internacional com a equipe, já que ele também esteve em Londres em 2022, quando a franquia de Green Bay foi derrotada pelo [New York Giants](/nfl/time/_/nome/nyg/new-york-giants). Para ele, algo importante. \"Bom, é nosso segundo jogo internacional em três anos, então tenho certeza que jogaremos mais algum desses. Com certeza é um previlégio. Cada oportunidade que temos de jogar fora, seja como mandante ou como visitante, em outro continente, é uma grande chance para o time, para jogadores mostrarem quem somos nós.\" Apesar de esbanjar felicidade, o treinador admitiu algo que considera um problema, pensando na longa temporada que seu time tem pela frente. \"É certamente uma experiência muito positiva, única coisa ruim foi o voo muito longo.\" Porém, ele sabe a \"solução\" para que os mais de 8.000 km de São Paulo até Green Bay no caminho de volta ocorram de uma maneira bem mais leve: a vitória contra os Eagles para iniciar a temporada. \"Não há nada melhor do que um voo de volta para casa depois de vencer um jogo.\" A partida entre Philadelphia Eagles e Green Bay Packers acontece nesta sexta-feira (6), na Neo Química Arena, em São Paulo, e terá [transmissão do Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/pt-br/browse/entity-e1235417-14fc-472d-8e6f-00a1501d4c58?cid=DTCI_STAR-Synergy-ESPN-Site-NA-DisneyPlus-BR-DisneyPlus-NA-PTBR-DStory-NFL_Eagles_Packers-NA) a partir das 21h15 (de Brasília).",

    "title": "Instead of selling Girl Scout cookies, they fundraised for Palestinian kids – The Forward",
    "text": "Fast Forward An all-Muslim Girl Scout troop in St. Louis was threatened with legal action after the troop skipped selling cookies to instead raise money to help injured Palestinian children. The eight-member troop made bracelets with letter beads spelling out “Palestine” or “Gaza” and sold them online for $5 to benefit the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. But after troop leader Nawal Abuhamdeh posted word of the project on Instagram and Facebook, saying “cookie season is going to look a little different for Troop 149 this year,” the Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri asked her to remove Girl Scout branding from the effort — or face legal action. “That was shocking. I was scared at first,” Abuhamdeh told a local NBC affiliate . Neither Abuhamdeh nor Girl Scouts of the USA, the organization’s national headquarters, responded to requests for comment. Outside fundraising in the past The regional council told Abuhamdeh in an email that she had to remove Girl Scout branding from her effort because the Girl Scouts are a “non-partisan organization that does not take sides in political situations.” Abuhamdeh questioned that reasoning, since her troop was raising money for a medical charity. Girl Scout fundraising for other humanitarian causes — like Ukraine — has been permitted in the past, and Girl Scouts of the USA, the group’s national organization, lifted an official ban on outside fundraising on Oct. 10, three days after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. That green light allowed Girl Scout troops to aid victims in the Israel-Gaza war as long as the money went to charities listed with Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits based on accountability and other practices. The charity chosen by the St. Louis troop, the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, aids children who need specialized surgery and has a four-star rating (the highest given) from Charity Navigator. But GSUSA ended the outside fundraising period on Jan. 10, just as annual Girl Scout cookie sales kicked off for the season. A few days later, Abuhamdeh’s troop opted to make bracelets instead of selling cookies after “debating whether we had the energy to put into a cookie season as we were grieving,” Abuhamdeh told NBC . Thousands of Palestinians, many of them children, have been killed and injured as a result of Israel’s war on Gaza. An apology GSUSA CEO Bonnie Barczykowski eventually apologized for the kerfuffle. She was quoted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as saying that the national office had not approved the threatening email and other messages sent by the regional council to the troop. The apology came after the Council on American-Islamic Relations asked the national organization to investigate what happened. But Abuhamdeh’s troop has now left the Girl Scouts altogether. She told The Washington Post the girls decided to leave because “they didn’t think we did anything wrong.” But she intends to keep them together doing community service work and other Girl Scout-type activities. It’s not unusual for Girl Scout troops to consist of members from a single ethnic group or religion. For example, GSUSA trumpeted the creation of an Orthodox Jewish Chabad-sponsored troop in 2010. GSUSA also recently announced that Noorain Kahn was the first Muslim American to become president of its national board. Kahn did not respond to a request for comment. The handmade beaded bracelets are now sold out, the Post-Dispatch reported, but the girls’ webpage allows for donations. So far they have raised $10,000 for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. “This isn’t political,” Abuhamdeh told the Post. “It’s very simple actually: We saw a need. We saw people hurting, and we wanted to help those people.”",

    "text": "JCM Racing will field an all-female nitro team in 2025, featuring drivers Alexis DeJoria and Ida Zetterström. DeJoria will drive the Bandero Premium Tequila Funny Car, while Zetterström will operate the JCM Racing Top Fuel Dragster.\nThe duo will debut as teammates during National Women’s Month at the NHRA Gatornationals in Gainesville, Fla., on March 7-9. DeJoria, a 12-year Funny Car veteran, will run the full NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series schedule, while Zetterström aims for a ten-race campaign to potentially expand her season.\n“This sport has a long history of powerful women who have made their mark not only on NHRA Drag Racing but the motorsports industry as a whole,” said team owner Joe Maynard. “Women have been at the forefront of the NHRA for many years, and we’re proud to be the first organization to have an all-female roster of nitro-powered drivers.”\nMaynard praised Zetterström’s potential championship success. “Her work ethic is incredible and that translates to success on the track,” he said. “As for Alexis, it’s clear that she is right there on the cusp, a champion-in-the-making.”\nMike ‘Zippy’ Neff will lead the Bandero Funny Car team, contributing his experience in tuning multiple drivers to race wins. Zetterström will continue to work with crew chief Jon Schaffer after their successful late-season debut in 2024.\n“I feel like we left a lot on the table when it comes to showing people what we’re capable of,” Zetterström said. “I hope we can put together the proper funding to race a full season, but regardless, I’ll be out at the track every race weekend.”\nBoth drivers come with impressive credentials, having spent years progressing through various levels of racing. Zetterström is a European drag racing champion, while DeJoria is a former U.S. Nationals champion and the first woman to achieve a three-second Funny Car pass.\n“Ida was a great addition to the tour last year, and I’m looking forward to having her as a teammate,” DeJoria said. “Our goal for this season is to be consistent and win races.”\nDeJoria and Zetterström will participate in a pre-season test session at Gainesville Raceway on March 4-5, ahead of the season opener.\nAs for Tony Schumacher, sources have indicated that he’s still seeking sponsorship for 2025 but, at this time, has no definite plans for the upcoming season.\nZetterström’s full schedule will be announced closer to the start of the season",
