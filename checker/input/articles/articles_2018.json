    "title": "La Jornada - Trabajadores alistan huelgas en plantas alemanas de VW",
    "text": "Berlín. El sindicato IG Metall dijo el viernes que los trabajadores de Volkswagen planean ir a la huelga en toda Alemania la próxima semana, en un momento en que el enfrentamiento entre los trabajadores y la dirección sobre los despidos y cierres de plantas se intensifica.\n“Las huelgas son posibles y también necesarias desde principios de diciembre”, dijo IG Metall en un folleto a los trabajadores visto por Reuters, y agregó que un acuerdo existente para no realizar paros terminará el 30 de noviembre.\nSe espera que las huelgas de advertencia en las plantas del fabricante de automóviles comiencen el lunes en toda Alemania, según personas conocedoras del asunto, lo que serían los primeros paros a gran escala en las operaciones nacionales de la compañía desde 2018.\nLas huelgas de advertencia suelen durar desde unas pocas horas hasta un día.\nVolkswagen exige un recorte salarial de diez por ciento, argumentando que necesita recortar costos y aumentar los beneficios para defender la cuota de mercado frente a la competencia barata china y la caída de la demanda de autos europeos. También amenaza con cerrar plantas en Alemania por primera vez en sus 87 años de historia.\nLos representantes de los trabajadores y la dirección volverán a reunirse el 9 de diciembre para seguir negociando un nuevo convenio laboral para los trabajadores de la empresa alemana -VW AG-, y los sindicatos prometen resistirse a cualquier propuesta que no ofrezca un plan a largo plazo para todas las plantas de la firma.\nLas huelgas, que podrían convertirse en paros de 24 horas o ilimitados si no se llega a un acuerdo en la próxima ronda de negociaciones salariales, harán mella en la producción de Volkswagen en un momento en que la compañía ya se enfrenta a la disminución de las entregas y la caída de los beneficios.\n“Volkswagen determinará en la mesa de negociaciones la duración y la dureza del conflicto: los trabajadores de VW en todo el país están dispuestos a ir a la huelga”, dijo IG Metall.\nUna propuesta de los sindicatos para evitar despidos y cierres de fábricas mediante medidas como la reducción de la jornada laboral y la renuncia a primas constituirá la base de las discusiones. Sin embargo, la dirección afirmó que no está dispuesta a retirar los cierres de plantas de la mesa de negociación.",

    "title": "Astronomers, on the warpath against an industrial megaproject that will 'blind' some of the best telescopes in the world",
    "text": "The Paranal Observatory, in the Chilean Atacama Desert, was inaugurated in 1999. Built and Operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), has been vital in such important discoveries as the first image of a planet beyond our Solar System or the confirmation that the universe is accelerating. Without going any further, the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for their discoveries on black holes thanks to the fundamental information collected by the Paranal telescopes about the invisible and supermassive ‘monster’ that it houses. the center of our galaxy.\nIt is no coincidence that this Chilean observatory has been the fundamental protagonist of all these discoveries. “Chile, and in particular Paranal, is a truly special place for astronomy: its dark skies are a natural heritage that transcends its borders and benefits all humanity,” says Itziar de Gregorio, ESO representative in Chile. That is to say, the location is perfect for this type of installation. Not surprisingly, nearby Cerro Armazones is home to the construction of ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the world’s largest telescope of its type, a revolutionary facility that will dramatically change what we know about our Universe.\nBut all this is in danger, ESO astronomers warn. An industrial megaproject threatens to alter the vision of these privileged skies. As explained by the institution, on December 24, AES Andes, a subsidiary of the American electricity company AES Corporation, presented the project for an “immense industrial complex” for the evaluation of its environmental impact. Specifically, these are facilities that cover more than 3,000 hectares, “almost the size of a city, district or commune such as Valparaíso (Chile) or Garching, near Munich (Germany),” the astronomers indicate. It also includes the construction of a port, ammonia and hydrogen production plants and thousands of electricity generation units that will be located, if everything goes as planned, between 5 and 11 kilometers from the Paranal Observatory.\n“The fact that the AES Andes industrial megaproject is so close to Paranal represents a critical risk for the most pristine night skies on the planet,” ESO Director General Xavier Barcons highlights in the statement. «Dust emissions during construction, increased atmospheric turbulence and, especially, light pollution, will have an irreparable impact on astronomical observation capabilities, which have so far attracted multi-million dollar investments by the governments of Member States of THAT.\nUnprecedented impact\nThanks to its atmospheric stability and the absence of light pollution, the Atacama Desert is a unique natural laboratory for astronomical research. These attributes are essential for scientific projects that aim to address fundamental questions, such as the origin and evolution of the universe or the search for life and the habitability of other planets. “It is crucial to consider alternative locations for this megaproject that do not endanger one of the world’s most important astronomical treasures,” says De Gregorio.\nAstronomers urge the relocation of this project as the only alternative to the problem. “This measure will not only safeguard the future of astronomy, but will also preserve one of the last truly pristine dark skies on Earth,” they indicate.\n#Astronomers #warpath #industrial #megaproject #blind #telescopes #world",

    "text": "Seriti’s green shift: First black-owned wind farm launched Seriti unveils its first majority black-owned wind farm in Mpumalanga, marking a significant step towards renewable energy. Work starts on Seriti Green’s wind farm in Mpumalanga. Pictures: Supplied\nTheir main business is coal, but for Seriti mining company, the future is green and it is investing heavily in renewable energy projects.\nDuring the unveiling of Seriti Green’s first majority black-owned wind farm in Mpumalanga, chair and group CEO of Seriti Resources, Mike Teke, said they were “positioned as an energy business”.\n“We cannot just shut down about 16 coal -fired power stations. There is a role to be played by coal into the near future,” he explained.\nExploring wind, solar, nuclear and coal Teke noted “as part of our energy business strategy, we explored global opportunities in wind, solar , nuclear and coal”.\n“Seriti is focused on expanding into renewables and green energy opportunities, while responsibly managing our coal assets. This balanced approach is crucial for our energy transition goals,” he said.\nFibre, cheaper data and weaver birds: Ramaphosa promises innovation\nThe energy company said the first phase of the construction of the 155MW Ummbila Emoyeni wind energy facility was underway and would be complete by July 2026.\n“The R4.8 billion project is the first since Seriti Resources, one of South Africa’s largest coal miners, announced its acquisition of Windlab and the subsequent launch of Seriti Green in 2023,” it said.\nThe project is anticipated to supply 75% of the power needs of Seriti’s Mpumalanga coal mines at a significantly lower cost than power from Eskom.\nThe 155MW project marks the first phase of a 900MW project which Seriti Green aims to build over the next three years at an estimated cost of R25 billion.\nGreat opportunity for local companies Seriti Green CEO Peter Venn said the country’s alternative energy space was ripe for diversification and it was a great opportunity for local companies to be part of the Just Energy Transition.\n“We can no longer ignore the effects of climate change and we must not delay in ensuring we reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and improve the lives of citizens who have borne the brunt of energy constraints,” he said.\n“There’s a crucial synergy between our coal and renewable energy businesses. It’s not a question of renewables versus coal; it’s renewables and coal working together.”\nVenn said they had transitioned 10% of Seriti Green’s workforce from coal, including their CFO, demonstrating commitment to job upskilling and creating opportunities in renewable energy.\n“We will complete 111 turbines over the next 36 months, totalling approximately R25 billion invested in Ummbila Emoyeni. A significant portion of Seriti’s investment is focused on this area, with plans to enhance local manufacturing capabilities through various initiatives,” he stated.\nEngaged with communities Economic development officer Yanelisa Matshotyana said they engaged with communities, ensuring openness and honesty in educating them about wind farms.\n“We needed to educate the community on what’s to come, what is renewable energy and windmills and how the community would benefit?\n“We listened to community needs and created a portal in 2022 to keep SMEs and job seekers informed about the project, ensuring transparency and maximising local opportunities.”\nVenn added that over the next decade, they would be working around Ummbila Emoyeni, creating numerous jobs. He noted similar economic growth in the Eastern Cape, where wind farms had transformed towns like Bedford.\n“A wind farm cannot absorb all workers from a coal mine. We’re focused on upskilling and creating jobs alongside the wind farm to prepare for the responsible closure of coal power stations.”\nCommunity pleased June Davids representing the community said: “We are pleased that this project will bring more jobs, economic opportunities and development.",
