    "title": "Bureau of Meteorology issues multiple severe thunderstorm warnings for southeast Qld, including Brisbane and Sunshine Coast",
    "text": "Multiple severe thunderstorms are likely for parts of southeast Queensland, including Brisbane and Sunshine Coast, with experts calling one storm “very dangerous”. A severe storm warning is in effect for parts of Ipswich, Gympie, Logan, Somerset, Scenic Rim, Sunshine Coast and Noosa council areas on Friday afternoon. The Bureau of Meteorology warned a “very dangerous thunderstorm likely to produce giant hailstones was detected near Kooralbyn”. “This thunderstorm is moving towards the north and is forecast to affect Boonah, and the area between Boonah and Beaudesert, by 2.40pm — and Beaudesert and Bundamba Lagoon by 3.10pm,” BOM said. “Other severe thunderstorms likely to produce large hailstones and damaging winds were detected near Borumba Dam and the area southwest of Eumundi. “These thunderstorms are moving towards the northeast and are forecast to affect the area southwest of Noosa Heads and Imbil by 2.40pm and Noosa Heads and Pomona by 3.10pm.” Senior meteorologist Shane Kennedy said that Brisbane was “fairly lucky” on Thursday and missed the worst of the weather, but “may not be quite as lucky during the Friday”. Reports of hail slamming parts of Brisbane CBD and New Farm began coming in just before 4pm. “All of these severe thunderstorms could bring large hail, so 2cm or more, damaging wind gusts, which are 90k/hr or more, and heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding,” Kennedy said. Giant hail, which BOM categorises as 5cm or more, has also been recorded in Boonah. BOM says more severe storms are likely to hit the southeast coast and parts of Wide Bay and Burnett forecast districts with a risk of large to giant hail, damaging to destructive winds and heavy rainfall. It said a moist and unstable air mass combined with a southeasterly wind change moving up the coast is leading to the development of severe thunderstorms through southeast Queensland. “Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds and large hailstones in the warning area over the next several hours,” BOM said. “Locations which may be affected include Gold Coast, Brisbane, Caboolture, Ipswich, Noosa Heads, Cleveland, Jimboomba, Mount Tamborine and Redcliffe.” BOM advised residents to park cars undercover away from trees, keep asthma medications close by as storms and wind can trigger asthma attacks, and charge mobile phones and power banks now in case the power goes out. Pets should also be kept somewhere safe, and with identifiable tags should they get out and become lost. A severe thunderstorm warning is also in place for parts of the Northern Rivers and Northern Tablelands in NSW. The warnings come a day after storms ripped through parts of southeast Queensland on Thursday, with SES crews responding to dozens of calls overnight. Most calls were related to property damage, with Maleny resident John Neil telling 7NEWS the windows in his Sunshine Coast house were smashed and his car damaged by golf ball-sized hail. Neil said the storms “came rolling in” and carpeted the lawn in hail, damaging the garden. Fellow Maleny resident Charlie Thompson said the storm came through quickly before the clouds turned green and hail covered his yard “like snow”. More than 150,000 lightning strikes were recorded, leaving thousands of residents without power.",

    "title": "Oregon Senate passes bill to relief financial burden of wildfire victims | Government | nrtoday.com",
    "text": "The Oregon Senate unanimously passed a bill Wednesday that would allow wildfire victims to be exempt from paying state taxes on settlements related to wildfire losses. Sen. Brian Boquist, R-Dallas, introduced Senate Bill 1520, which will exempt legal settlements after Jan. 1, 2020, related to wildfires, that were declared state and federal emergencies, to be exempt from state income taxes. \"Unfortunately, I have had too many of my residents in my district from Curry to Douglas County lose their home due to wildfire,\" Sen. David Brock Smith, R-Port Orford, said. \"This is a pretty exceptional bill to help them with those tax relief dollars. Their settlements should not be taxed.\" Boquist said that while many victims are receiving settlements, they owe roughly 45% of those settlements in state and federal taxes. Boquist argued a $500,000 settlement with a taxation of 45% and legal expenses of 35%, leave people with $100,000 — not enough to rebuild. \"You can't build a house for $100,000. You just can't do it. It's impossible,\" Boquist said. The bill has moved into the House of Representatives where it was referred to the revenue committee. Several Douglas County residents spoke out in favor of the bill during public comment. Patricia Lee, of Idleyld Park, said, \"No amount of money can replace family treasures, our beloved forestland, hand-built homes and gardens, and workshops, but it can ease the burden for all.\" Jeffrey Mornarich, an attorney at Dole Coalwell Attorney who has represented 463 individual victims in court, wrote the victims receive approximately 20 to 30% of the total settlement. \"These fire victims desperately need relief from this draconian tax law so that they have a fighting change to begin to rebuild their lives.\" Mornarich added that the tax relief should not have an impact on Oregon's projected tax revenue. Nancy Tague, of Roseburg, wrote, \"Until September 8, 2020, I had lived for 24 years on 20 acres of beautiful forest land near the North Umpqua River. That day, I lost my home, possessions, land, and way of life in the Archie Creek Fire. We had about 15 minutes to throw a few belongings in the car and drive out through flames. Everything left behind was incinerated. I am 69 years old. A lifetime was gone in minutes.\" Tague said she was shocked by how little of the settlement money she would receive, and called it \"an extreme example of government greed.\" Several others recounted their losses — homes, pets, property, business, timber, wildlife. Sharon Blodgett, of Idleyld Park, wrote. \"In essence, we lost our way of life we have worked hard to achieve.\" Cheryl Schwartz, of Roseburg, wrote that for 30 years she and her husband spent time building their property along the North Umpqua to carry them into their golden years in \"reasonable comfort, independence and security, only to have it stolen from us by corporate carelessness.\" Pacific Power has been a defendant for many of the wildfire lawsuits in Oregon in recent years, including those related to the Archie Creek Fire that raged in Douglas County in 2020. Susan Rudisill, of Idleyld Park, wrote, \"Since the fire, recovery has dominated my time, my conversations, my mental state. It has consumed most of my energy, and much of my family’s financial resources. Being consumed with clean-up and recovery work, we have lost other opportunities. My career as an artist has been neglected. Since the fire, my husband has aged rapidly, and it’s been hard to enjoy his 'golden years.' Wildfire is the disaster that keeps on … taking. Taking energy. Taking resources. Taking more trees. Requiring more restoration work. How is one to be compensated for all the intangible losses? Please don’t take still more from us, in the form of taxes.\" If the bill passes the House, impacted people who have already filed taxes for those years can file amendments.",

    "title": "Apple Vision Pro Transforms Surgery in Operating Rooms",
    "text": "Surgeons at UC San Diego Health now use Apple’s Vision Pro headset for minimally invasive surgeries, marking a major step in medical AR technology. Dr. Santiago Horgan, a leader in robotic surgery, believes the Vision Pro could be as transformative as previous advances. Over the last month, he and his team have used the headset in more than 20 procedures, including acid-reflux and obesity surgeries.\nEnhancing Precision and Reducing Strain\nThe Vision Pro displays vital information within the surgeon’s view, eliminating the need to look away from the patient. In traditional laparoscopic surgery, surgeons must use separate monitors for camera feeds and patient data, which can cause strain. With the Vision Pro, they can see multiple virtual screens—such as CT scans and heart rate monitors—all in one view. Dr. Horgan notes this setup has improved his accuracy and reduced physical discomfort.\nCost-Effective for Hospitals\nThe Vision Pro’s $3,499 price may seem high for consumers but is much less than standard medical monitors, which can cost up to $30,000. Dr. Christopher Longhurst, Chief Innovation Officer at UC San Diego Health, views this affordability as a significant advantage, especially for smaller hospitals. The device’s lower cost could allow more facilities to adopt advanced technology without a high financial burden.\nThe Future of AR in Medicine\nWhile the Vision Pro is not yet FDA-approved for widespread medical use, UC San Diego Health plans to continue its trials. Dr. Longhurst expects AR headsets like the Vision Pro to become standard in operating rooms worldwide. Early results show promise, suggesting AR technology could improve patient outcomes and assist healthcare professionals.\nApple’s Vision Pro isn’t the only AR device in the medical field. Other companies, like Augmedics and Vuzix, also offer headsets for surgical assistance. However, the Vision Pro stands out for its compatibility with existing systems, making it easier to integrate. As Apple and other tech companies continue to innovate, AR’s role in healthcare will likely expand, changing how surgeries are performed.",

    "text": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected U.S. demands to halt civilian nuclear research as \"bullying,\" while President Donald Trump warned the Middle East could become \"a dangerous place\" amid escalating regional tensions.\nPezeshkian, speaking during a visit to Ilam province, said Iran would continue negotiations but would never submit to pressure, according to Iran's official news agency IRNA.\n\"We will not bow to bullying. We will never accept reducing our research to zero and then waiting for their approval to obtain nuclear materials needed in industry, medicine, agriculture, and other sciences,\" Pezeshkian stated.\nThe Iranian president emphasized that negotiations are being conducted within the framework set by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nAddressing Washington's demands for Iran to completely halt uranium enrichment activities and nuclear research, Pezeshkian questioned the legitimacy of such requirements.\n\"Who said we need permission to conduct scientific research?\" \"Who are they to tell us to dismantle our entire nuclear industry?\" he said.\nPezeshkian stressed Iran would never abandon scientific research, adding, \"They tell us not to have this science. Then, if we say something against them, they say Israel will bomb us. When our scientists and elites built missiles, Saddam could no longer bomb our cities. Until we had missiles, he was hitting us every day.\"\nPresident Trump, speaking to reporters at the Kennedy Center in Washington while attending a musical opening with First Lady Melania Trump, commented on the withdrawal of non-essential American personnel from some Middle Eastern countries.\n\"They're pulling out because it could become a dangerous place. We'll see what happens. We issued the notification for them to withdraw. They cannot have nuclear weapons. That's very clear. They cannot have nuclear weapons. \"We will not allow it,\" Trump said.\nA U.S. State Department official, quoted in Israeli media, stated, \"President Trump is committed to keeping Americans safe both at home and abroad.\nIn line with this commitment, we continuously evaluate appropriate personnel status at all our embassies. Based on our latest analysis, we have decided to reduce our mission presence in Iraq.\"\nThe State Department has authorized the departure of non-essential personnel and family members from Bahrain and Kuwait.\nAdditionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the voluntary departure of military personnel's family members from various Middle East locations.\nPezeshkian called for internal unity in Iran, stating, \"If we set aside our differences, enemies will have no desire against these lands.\" They want to sow discord among us and exploit the situation to attack us.\"\nThe Iranian president maintained that not possessing nuclear weapons is a definitive and unchangeable policy for Iran while insisting on recognition of the country's legal, scientific, and international rights.\n\"We are conducting negotiations with dignity and our heads held high. Our only demand is recognition of our legal, scientific, and international rights, and we ask for nothing else,\" he said.\nTrump, in a separate post on his Truth Social platform, expressed confidence in U.S. military capabilities: \"The U.S. military will achieve victory after victory in the coming days and every future generation, I am more certain than ever. You will display endless courage. You will protect every inch of U.S. soil and defend America around the world!\"\nThe evacuations come as the Trump administration seeks a new nuclear deal with Iran while tensions between Iran and Israel continue to escalate.",

    "title": "Here's what you can do to keep outdoor pets safe and warm this weekend",
    "text": "Winter is coming to Northeast Ohio in full force this coming weekend, and with that, some precautions need to be taken for outdoor pets. Shannon Harvey with the Cleveland Animal Protective League said that while taking pets inside is the best thing to do in cold weather, it may not always be an option. “We know that there are people who keep their dogs outside and cats that are living in the community,” Harvey said. “So, for people who do have dogs outside, they need to make sure that they are being provided with adequate shelter, and that means a secure enclosure that's big enough for the dog to get into the stand-up to turn around.” Harvey said an ideal enclosure should be raised, insulated and have a door flap for the animal. Additionally, the shelter should not be too big, or else it will not stay insulated. “We don't want it to be too big because if it is too big, then it doesn't have the same insulating quality as an enclosure that is big enough for the dog but not overly big. Their body heat can help them out. But preferably that, to me, is a last resort,” Harvey said. “Preferably people should bring those outdoor dogs in either into a sheltered garage or into their house, at least during the time that the weather is this bad and the temperatures are low and it's snowing.” For insulation, Harvey recommends using straw rather than blankets; that way, if the enclosure gets wet, the blankets won't freeze. The costs of these enclosures can vary, but Harvey said that for people who are more handy, making one can be pretty easy. “There are very elaborate outdoor enclosures for both dogs and cats. But then people who are handy can very easily you know, construct a shelter themselves,” Harvey said. “Additionally, like especially for cats, there are lots of websites people can go online and check out websites for how to make an outdoor cat warm insulated enclosure using things as inexpensive and accessible as those old Styrofoam coolers.” Harvey said that there are risks to having outdoor-only pets, not only in the winter. With the extreme weather Cleveland has year-round, any season can be harmful to outdoor pets. Typically, in the winter, there is a risk of frostbite and other illnesses for dogs. But in the summer, pets can experience heat exhaustion and heat stroke, amongst other things, if left outside. “From the standpoint of being in Cleveland, where we have weather extremes, obviously in the winter, we go through periods like this where the temperatures drop precipitously, and there's snow,” Harvey said. “And outdoor dogs, especially if they are not bred to tolerate cold temperatures, if they have short hair, if they're older, if they're very young, if they have an illness, are not going to fare well and could suffer hypothermia and be at risk of either significant illness or death or frostbite.” Harvey said these risks are mainly toward dogs because outdoor or stray cats typically freely roam communities and are able to find adequate shelter from harsh conditions. “We're very grateful to the people and the neighborhoods and community [stray] cat caregivers who are providing them with this care, and with that, they should be okay during these weather snaps, but dogs that are living, you know, on chains, we really hope and want and ask I'm going to say we really ask that people get those dogs inside,” Harvey said.",

    "text": "KOTTAYAM: Unless the Left Front in Kerala is willing to learn from the repeated shock therapy administered by people, it risks suffering the same fate as the Left parties in West Bengal and Tripura, said Geevarghese Mar Coorilos, the metropolitan of Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church.In a social media post, the metropolitan attributed the Left’s failure primarily to a strong anti-incumbency wave and emphasized that this remains a stark reality despite CPM’s steadfast denial. He outlined several factors contributing to the Left’s failure, including shortcomings in economic policies, a lack of discipline, excessive spending, flawed police strategies, media hunting, corruption within the cooperative sector, pension issues, political violence associated with SFI, intolerance to criticism, and attempts to appease religious and communal groups beyond reasonable limits.The Left front’s aggressive campaign against Rahul Gandhi, who fought against fascism, raised concerns among secular people, he said, and pointed out that its criticism of Congress was harsher compared to its approach towards BJP.He cautioned against relying on floods and pandemics to come to its rescue and emphasized that people will not always be swayed by “kit politics”, particularly in Kerala. He also welcomed CPM leadership’s acknowledgment of the need for corrections. Stressing the deep-rooted complexity of the problems, the metropolitan said superficial remedies are insufficient.",

    "text": "Talento Joven Fundación BBVA María José Martínez-Pérez, física: «El riesgo de que la mano humana pierda relevancia frente a la IA y la computación cuántica es elevadísimo»\nPredecir con total exactitud el clima, recrear el Big Bang en el laboratorio… Son algunas de las promesas de la computación cuántica. María José Martínez ha sido premiada por la Fundación BBVA y la Real Sociedad Española de Física por investigar los materiales con los que se construirán los 'todopoderosos' ordenadores del futuro.\nViernes, 15 de Noviembre 2024, 11:32h\nTiempo de lectura: 2 min\nLa ciencia de materiales se hace de una manera muy 'cocinillas': probando todo y observando a ver qué pasa. Con la computación cuántica será mucho más rápida y eficiente: podremos diseñar baterías, placas solares, vacunas…», explica María José Martínez-Pérez (Huesca, 1983), galardonada con el Premio Investigador Joven en Física Experimental de la Real Sociedad Española de Física y la Fundación BBVA por su trabajo pionero en sensores magnéticos ultrasensibles en 2020.\n«El campo de la computación cuántica es muy competitivo: hace diez años era cosa de locos y ahora hay mucha empresa privada. El 90 por ciento son hombres. Hay quien diseña sus experimentos solo para decir que ha alcanzado la supremacía cuántica… Yo investigo a la vieja usanza: colaborando, fijándome en fenómenos inexplicados, siempre en el límite. Son experimentos para tener una comprensión más profunda de la materia; otros los aprovecharán para idear aplicaciones», cuenta. «Para un físico, hablar de décadas es razonable; un ingeniero tiene menos paciencia. Lo que ya estamos viendo es increíble, pero los retos son monumentales. Los ordenadores cuánticos más avanzados tienen cientos de cúbits (bits cuánticos), pero habrá que escalarlos para que tengan millones. Y lograr, además, que funcionen sin error. Son muy delicados. No sé si hay alguien que tenga una idea clara de cómo hacerlo», reconoce esta investigadora del Instituto de Nanociencia y Materiales de Aragón.\n«La capacidad de un simulador cuántico de predecir nuevos materiales, combinada con la inteligencia artificial, será asombrosa. Pero me preocupa que la mano humana pierda relevancia. Sin una regulación adecuada, el riesgo es elevadísimo», advierte. «Cuando propones cosas que nadie ha hecho antes, te encuentras con problemas. Pero a mí me han apoyado a pesar de que no publico muchos artículos; cada uno me lleva años», señala. «El reconocimiento es muy importante. Me dieron la Beca Leonardo en 2019; luego obtuve una Starting Grant del Consejo Europeo de 1,8 millones de euros. Muchos se desaniman. Obtener plaza, financiación parece tan difícil… Pero la ciencia es compatible con una vida personal plena, con una familia. Yo tengo tres hijos».\nLas claves de mi investigación\n«Estamos desarrollando sensores que permiten estudiar materiales magnéticos a escalas muy peque-ñas y temperaturas bajísimas. Son sistemas únicos. No se han probado antes».\n«Llevará años, pero ya hacemos cosas increíbles. Podemos manipular objetos para que se comporten según las reglas de la física cuántica que rigen en el interior del átomo».\n«Estos sensores magnéticos podrían ser un componente básico de los futuros ordenadores cuánticos, que tendrán millones de cúbits (bits cuánticos) funcionando sin error».\n«La computación cuántica nos permitirá simular nuevos materiales y emular fenómenos que los ordenadores actuales no pueden procesar; incluso recrear lo que sucede en un agujero negro».\n-\n[1 ¿Por qué los humanos tenemos el culo más grande que el resto de los primates?](/xlsemanal/ciencia/culo-cerebro-evolucion-bipedismo-arsuaga-kardashian.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[2 ¿Cómo esta abuela de Zambia se ha convertido en un fenómeno en redes sociales?](/xlsemanal/a-fondo/abuela-zambia-icono-moda-redes-sociales-exito-legendary-glamma.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[3 Cazadores de agujeros negros: la respuesta a todos los misterios del universo](/xlsemanal/a-fondo/agujeros-negros-cazadores-respuestas-misterios-unvierso.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[4 Qué hacer si eres de los que se despierta cansado todos los días](/xlsemanal/salud/que-hacer-si-despiertas-cansado-problemas-dormir-sueno.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[5 El origen del hombre no era como pensábamos: desandamos los pasos de Lucy (y sus congéneres chinos)](/xlsemanal/a-fondo/evolucion-origen-hombre-descubrimiento-lucy-homo-sapiens-africa.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven)\n-\n[1 ¿Por qué los humanos tenemos el culo más grande que el resto de los primates?](/xlsemanal/ciencia/culo-cerebro-evolucion-bipedismo-arsuaga-kardashian.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[2 ¿Cómo esta abuela de Zambia se ha convertido en un fenómeno en redes sociales?](/xlsemanal/a-fondo/abuela-zambia-icono-moda-redes-sociales-exito-legendary-glamma.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[3 Cazadores de agujeros negros: la respuesta a todos los misterios del universo](/xlsemanal/a-fondo/agujeros-negros-cazadores-respuestas-misterios-unvierso.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[4 Qué hacer si eres de los que se despierta cansado todos los días](/xlsemanal/salud/que-hacer-si-despiertas-cansado-problemas-dormir-sueno.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven) -\n[5 El origen del hombre no era como pensábamos: desandamos los pasos de Lucy (y sus congéneres chinos)](/xlsemanal/a-fondo/evolucion-origen-hombre-descubrimiento-lucy-homo-sapiens-africa.html#vca=modulos&vso=eldiariomontanes&vmc=lo-mas-visto&vli=talento-joven)",
