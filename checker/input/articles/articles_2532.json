    "text": "El Gobierno no afloja la tensión contra los gremios aeronáuticos . El secretario de Transporte, Franco Mogetta , criticó este jueves el paro de 24 h en Aerolíneas Argentinas anunciado para el viernes próximo y redobló la apuesta: \"Lo que le molesta a la casta sindical es que estamos terminando con sus privilegios\".\nEl contenido al que quiere acceder es exclusivo para suscriptores.\nsuscribirse ya estoy suscripto Luego del anuncio de la medida de fuerza para pedir mejoras salariales, el Gobierno insiste en pegarle a los sindicatos y amenazó con \"pedir el quite de personería\" . Mogetta aseguró que con el plan de lucha de los sindicatos es \"insólito\" porque \"van a fundir la empresa aérea (...) y después echarle la culpa al Gobierno\".\nInformate más Los gremios aeronáuticos terminaron una nueva jornada de reclamos, con bajo impacto en los vuelos Vuelos con demoras por asambleas de aeronáuticos en Aeroparque, Ezeiza y el interior del país Los gremios aeronáuticos reclaman que perdieron el 75% del poder adquisitivo de los salarios desde que asumió Javier Milei. Mogetta no hizo referencia al tema y, por el contrario, defenestró los derechos laborales, a lo que calificó de \"privilegios que al país le cuestan muchísimo dinero\". Como ejemplos aseguró que \"los pilotos no trabajan en los días de su cumpleaños o tienen un remís que los pasa a buscar desde su casa\".\nEl paro de 24 h en Aerolíneas Argentinas para el próximo viernes A pesar de las amenazas del Gobierno, gremios aeronáuticos profundizan el plan de lucha. Los sindicatos de Pilotos y de Aeronavegantes (azafatas y azafatos) votaron un paro de 24 horas en Aerolíneas Argentinas a partir del viernes a las 12 del mediodía. Reclaman mejoras salariales.\n\" Tenemos un atraso salarial del 75% y trabajadores por debajo de la línea de la pobreza \", explicaron a Ámbito fuentes del gremio de Aeronavegantes. La medida de fuerza se votó este miércoles en una asamblea conjunta de los gremios aeronáuticos.\nla Asociación Argentina de Aeronavegantes (AAA) difundió un comunicado anunciando la medida de fuerza del viernes próximo. \"La brutal escalada a la que tanto las autoridades nacionales como empresariales nos han empujado con su irracionalidad e intransigencia, no ha dejado abierta ninguna otra alternativa para defender, no sólo nuestros salarios, sino más importante aún, nuestro futuro \", explicaron.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - EIN Presswire) PLANO, TX, USA, December 29, 2023 /EINPresswire / -- Healthcare is one of the few sectors of labor in the United States where the workforce is fairly assured of stable and steady employment. Everyone needs healthcare services at some point – particularly given the aging of the U.S. population. New developments in medical technology, drugs and treatments continue at a strong pace. The sector itself must change in order to accommodate the current labor climate, experts say.\nThe healthcare sector has long had to manage persistent labor shortages. Medical schools and nursing schools are limited in how many graduates they can produce on an annual basis, as are programs for allied professions such as surgical and imaging technicians.\nCombine this chronic shortage of newly minted professionals and skilled workers with worker burnout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the lowest unemployment rate in 55 years, and the issue becomes more concerning.\nEric Dickerson , managing director and senior practice leader for Kaye Bassman , a recruiting firm based in Plano, Texas, observed that the healthcare labor is among the tightest he has ever seen. Although the nationwide labor participation rate is about 63% among all adults, it is 83.5% among those in the prime working ages of 25 to 54. Given the myriad business sectors across the United States, that means the healthcare sector is competing for just a small sliver of the U.S. labor market.\nRead more:\nDarren McDougal\nKaye/Bassman International Corp\n+1 972-931-5242\nemail us here\nVisit us on social media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nMENAFN29122023003118003196ID1107669468\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

La convicción la tenemos, que eso es lo más importante, y la convicción no es otra cosa que voluntad política, quien no tiene voluntad política para hacer las cosas, pues no. Tenemos que caminar hacia la igualdad, ya ni siquiera hacia la perspectiva, la igualdad es más”, afirmó el gobernador Rocha.\nDijo que su gobierno es el primero en la historia de Sinaloa en contar con un gabinete totalmente paritario, es decir, con un mismo número de hombres y mujeres como titulares de las diferentes Secretarías que lo componen.\nHemos caminado: es el primer gabinete paritario que tenemos, pero lo que tiene que ver con lo sustantivo, alejado de lo aritmético, es también convicción nuestra”, destacó Rocha.\nLa oficial nacional del PNUD explicó que el objetivo de crear esta Estrategia es para promover que los gobiernos locales de México integren la perspectiva de género y la participación ciudadana en la documentación, en sus lineamientos y en su presupuestación local.\nMuchas felicidades por este avance tan importante”, dijo la funcionaria de la ONU.\nJCS",

    "text": "[Sergio_ftv](/user/Sergio_ftv)a [twitter.com](/go/link/3891526) [#3](c3#c-3) El otro día alguien pegó un enlace por Menéame de boicots a empresas que colaboran con los israelitas.\nBásicamente, tú y yo no podemos boicotear a determinadas empresas en España y simplemente no va a suceder, porque hay cientos o incluso miles de millones en suculentos contratos en juego.\nHablo principalmente de la vasca CAF, que básicamente construye trenes para Israel que hacen posible el transporte de pasajeros entre los diferentes territorios ocupados, muchas veces cruzando tierras palestinas expoliadas. CAF y un par más que no recuerdo, de infraestructuras.\nCuando alguien se pregunte \"cómo puede ser que Pedro Sánchez...\" la respuesta es CAF y miles de millones (y puestos de trabajo).\n[#3](c3#c-3) Yo es algo que ya llevo defendiendo tiempo, eso y que echen a la embajadora y corten rotundamente con ellos, lo demás me parece palabrerio y cada día una masacre\n[#3](c3#c-3) no se debe generalizar..esto no es más que un tweet descontextualizado que podria ser un fake y que es tratado en meneame como una noticia seria...en fin\n[#25](c25#c-25) desde luego que todos sabemos que hay muchas noticias fakes buscando generar opinión,,, hay que tomarlo todo con pinzas porque en la guerra la propaganda es otro campo de batalla. Y sin defender a israel a mi me chirría cualquier comentario que busque tomar medidas o represalias de cualquier grupo de personas con motivos como su etnia, nacionalidad, religión, origen, sexualidad etc Estoy seguro de que hay muchos israelís bellísimas personas que no tienen nada que ver con este individuo (sea el video un fake, una treatalización o algo real)\n[#6](c6#c-6) con perdón de las putas y sus hijos, que no tiene culpa ni son responsables de nada.\nCambia tus insultos. Estos sionistas son mucho peores.\n[#26](c26#c-26) Que el usuario a quien criticabas te haya dado la razón no quiere decir que la tengas. Que mi comentario tenga más karma tampoco me da la razón. Lo que da y quita razones son los argumentos y mi argumento es la definición de la RAE. Hijo de puta usado como insulto no significa que el referido tenga una madre puta, sino que es mala persona. De hecho si el significado fuera literal no tendría una definición específica.\n[#5](c5#c-5) sinceramente creo que es humor negro ... Como si le hubieran preguntado sobre el tema y haga una exageración. Eso da a entender la escena, taaaaan cortada\nY podéis revisar mis historial.... Que desprecio al sionista genocida no falta cada día...\n[#47](c47#c-47) podría ser, pero el humor negro a veces se hace en el momento o lugar incorrecto. Yo no veo las noticias que se envían ni nada, solo veo los comentarios, y por esos mismos comentarios parece que es una barbarie. Gastar bromas en ese momento me sigue pareciendo una inmundicia. No sería lo mismo que decirlo en serio, evidentemente, pero sigue siendo un mensaje que aborrezco.\n[#52](c52#c-52) es una videollamada ....yo veo que responde con sarcasmo a algo.\nMe cuadra un:\n- como llevas tú vida de soldado sabiendo que los niños son asesinados?\nY responde así... Como exagerando por qué ve eso como una exageración. Y puede ser real, que tenga esa percepción....\nLuego vienen las cifras.\nSabemos que los sionistas están cometiendo crímenes atroces, pero esto es un corte de un vídeo totalmente descontextualizado. Sin más información es imposible darlo por válido, siendo justos.\nNo creo que sea necesario caer en montajes con toda la información verídica que hay sobre los desmanes sionistas.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Como si fuese el primer tarado de las ISF que sale diciendo cosas parecidas. Como el que se jactaba de disparar a mujeres y niños en una protesta.\n[#9](c9#c-9) es el equivalente a \"seremos fachas pero sabemos gestionar\"\n¿Salió espontáneo o ante una acusación de un periodista \"les llaman fachas, qué opina de eso\"? Pues a veces las declaraciones sensacionalista salen de sacar de contexto frases inconexas.\nLo de PAM \"cientos de violadores, (risas de fondo) MILES de violadores), también sirve como ejemplo.\nHan conseguido que todo el horror que sintió el mundo por el holocausto haya revertido contra ellos ¡malditos asesinos!\nLo que dice es exactamente lo contrario... Que las noticias son falsas y que no están matando bebés ni niñas... Es precisamente de lo que se ríe, de que se inventen noticias.\nNo defiendo a Israel, ni mucho menos, pero este tweet es noticia? Son como 5 segundos y no hay ningún tipo de contexto de nada. No sé quién es este señor, si va en serio o es irónico; en definitiva, que Israel hace muchas cosas graves y perfectamente documentadas como para tener que estar llevando esto a portada... No con mi voto.\nA mí me parece una broma de muy mal gusto que el resto de la comunidad internacional, por intereses particulares muy por encima de los intereses humanos, no haga nada mas que oídos sordos a lo que esra haciendo Israel y con la malicia que lo está haciendo. Luego que si cientos de películas sobre lo malos que eran los nazis.. pero a estos los ignoran.\nAunque sea totalmente evidente que la intención de este tweet es propagar un bulo de un comentario irónico sino directamente prefabricado, esta clase de \"noticias\" son las que molan en esta Menealandia progre.\nRelacionada:\nSoziedad Alkoholika - Nos vimos en Berlín:\nLo único que me jode de saber que Dios no existe (y en este caso ojalá me equivoque) es que mierdas de humanos como este tipo de van a quedar sin castigo.\nOjalá a este tipo le pase lo peor y lo sufra durante mucho tiempo.\nEsto es repulsivo, absolutamente repulsivo que estos sacos de basura estén amparados por la comunidad internacional y que no se pare esto\nA los que dudáis de la autenticidad del vídeo...¿no habéis visto los vídeos donde un palestino habla por internet con civiles al azar sionistas y estos se burlan de los niños asesinados?\n¿Todavia pensáis que hay un solo sionista que no sea un trastornado psicópata?",

    "text": "BEAUFORT COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - The Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office alongside the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division arrested three men in connection to an ongoing human trafficking investigation. Alban Bryan, 63, of Saint Helena Island, is charged with first-degree trafficking in persons, victim under 18 years old and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Guy Frank Talley III, 27, of Okatie, is charged with first-degree trafficking in persons, victim under 18 years old, second-degree sexual exploitation of a minor and third-degree sexual exploitation of a minor. William James Youmans, 34, of Beaufort, is charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and first-degree trafficking in persons, victim under 18 years old. Sometime between Feb. 1 and Feb. 13, Bryan recruited, solicited or transported a minor for sex trafficking purposes, court documents state. In the same timeframe, Bryan is also accused of housing and providing narcotics to a minor he knew was reported missing from her home on Saint Helena Island. Between Feb. 13 and March 5, Talley recruited, solicited or transported a minor for sex trafficking purposes. Talley also distributed, transported, received, sold, purchased or solicited sexual abuse materials, and he had media of a minor engaging in sexual activity on his cellphone, the arrest warrant states. Child advocates say the term “child sexual abuse material” is a more accurate reflection of the material involved in this type of crime, arguing the term “child pornography” could imply to some that the child was a consenting participant. The attorney general’s office says “child sexual abuse material” is being used more often globally for that reason. Sometime between Feb. 9 and March 5, Youmans knowingly contributed to the delinquency of a minor who was reported missing by the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office. He is accused of providing transportation and narcotics to the girl during this time, court documents state. Youmans is accused of recruiting, soliciting or transporting a minor for sex trafficking purposes. Bryan, Talley and Youmans were arrested and booked into the Beaufort County Detention Center on Tuesday. The 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office will prosecute the case. The Beaufort Police Department, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office, the Hardeeville Police Department and the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations assisted in the investigation. Authorities said the investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information is encouraged to contact SLED by calling 803-896-7400 or by emailing [tips@sled.sc.gov](mailto:tips@sled.sc.gov).
