    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas - The University of Texas at Austin released a statement and announced a curfew following the dozens of arrests that took place on campus during a Pro-Palestine rally on Wednesday, April 24.\nAccording to the Travis County Sheriff&apos;s Office, 57 people were arrested during the demonstration on the University of Texas at Austin campus.\nOn Thursday, UT Austin said 26 of those arrested were affiliated with the university.\nUT Austin&apos;s statement can be found below:\n\"Wednesday’s protest organized by the Palestine Solidarity Committee sought to follow the playbook of the national campaign to paralyze the operations of universities across the country. Like at each of those universities, and confirming our serious concern, there was significant participation by outside groups present on our campus yesterday. This outside group presence is what we’ve seen from the affiliated national organization’s efforts to disrupt and create disorder. Roughly half (26) of the 55 people who violated Institutional Rules and were ultimately arrested were unaffiliated with The University of Texas. Thirteen pro-Palestinian free speech events have taken place at the University largely without incident since October. In contrast, this one in particular expressed an intent to disrupt the campus and directed participants to break Institutional Rules and occupy the University, consistent with national patterns.\"\n— According to the university, there have been 13 other pro-Palestine free speech events that have taken place since October 2023. Wednesday&apos;s rally was the first to be non-peaceful.\nIn response to the protests, UT Austin enacted a curfew on all university property. According to the notice sent to students, \"everyone must leave the main mall or other university property no later than 10:00 p.m.\"\nThe notice previously mentions \"those who violate these or any other rule, policy, or law are subject to immediate removal from campus, conduct charges, or arrest.\"\nStudents did not seem fazed by the notice. They told FOX 7 Austin it was nothing compared to what they witnessed one day prior .\nOn Thursday, the campus was filled with protesters once again for the second time in a row. The Texas State Employees Union postponed their scheduled, unrelated rally to open the space back up for pro-Palestine protesters.\nHundreds of protesters gathered outside UT’s tower as the events that took place one day prior still hung in the air. However, that did not stop protesters from coming back for day two. This included dozens of students and community members who were arrested during the pro-Palestine protest on Wednesday.\n\"I was jailed with 19 and 20-year-olds who had been brutalized, tackled, wounded from having their faces slammed,\" one UT Austin staff member said during the protest.\nThose at Wedneday&apos;s protest say it was peaceful and claim the police force was uncalled for.\n\"If I can’t protest on a college campus, what is this country? Are we back in the 50s?,\" said a protester.\nThat protester told FOX 7 Austin what happened the day prior fueled him to come back, and clearly he was not alone.\n\"I’m not going to lie down and take this. This is a university that I help fund. I&apos;m not going to be intimidated by police because of my free speech rights to this atrocity,\" he said.\nHowever, pro-Israel protesters had a different view of events and joined in a counterprotest on the outskirts of the free Palestine protest. One pro-Israel protester said she was harassed and had all her signs stolen. She claims the protest was far from peaceful.\nLocal politicians like Congressman Greg Casar and Austin Council Member Zo Qadri joined the protest, calling for UT students to continue in their right to protest.\nMayor of Austin Kirk Watson also joined in on social media.\nThursday’s protest not only called for Palestine&apos;s freedom, but also the resignation of UT Austin President Jay Hartzell after his response to what happened on campus .\n\"Jay Hartzel has lost all trust. I am disgusted,\" said a protester.\nHundreds of students walked out of class on Wednesday, April 24 to rally for Palestine and attempt to occupy the South Lawn on campus.\nThe students gathered on the South Lawn and set up tents while chanting \"Free Free Palestine\" and other slogans, including ones aimed at the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and even Austin police.\nProtesters called for a ceasefire between the Israeli forces and Hamas, as well as an end to what they call the occupation of Palestine.\nMORE STORIES:\nUT Austin Palestine protest: Demonstrators criticize response, call for Hartzell resignation UT Austin Palestine rally: Criminal charges dropped against some protesters UT Austin Palestine rally: Protesters released from jail UT Austin Palestine rally: Dozens wait outside Travis County Jail for protesters arrested University of Texas Palestine protest leads to almost 60 arrests, including FOX 7 photographer On Thursday, the Travis County attorney dropped criminal charges against some of the protesters arrested during the rally.\nThe county attorney&apos;s office says it received 46 cases Wednesday and throughout the evening.",

Près de trois quarts des entreprises interrogées ont indiqué perdre des employés au profit d’organisations offrant plus de flexibilité en termes de lieu de travail et d’horaires de travail. Cette tendance est alimentée par le besoin croissant des employés d’un meilleur équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée, comme en témoigne le fait que 84 pour cent des répondants ont exprimé cette préférence.\nAvantages pour les entreprises\nMalgré ces défis, de nombreuses entreprises s’adaptent avec succès aux modèles de travail à distance et hybrides. Plus de 76 pour cent des entreprises utilisant des approches hybrides recrutent activement de nouveaux employés, contre 70 pour cent de celles qui s’en tiennent aux arrangements traditionnels sur site. Cette évolution vers le flexibilité au travail ne vise pas seulement à répondre aux besoins des employés, mais aussi à produire des avantages commerciaux tangibles. Pour 40 pour cent des personnes interrogées, le travail à distance est synonyme d’augmentation de la productivité et pour 31 pour cent d’amélioration des performances globales de l’entreprise.\nSatisfaction et bien-être des employés\nLe rapport souligne également l’impact du travail à distance sur la satisfaction et le bien-être des employés. 40 pour cent des entreprises indiquent que le travail à distance améliore le moral des employés, tandis que 40 pour cent d’entre elles soulignent son rôle dans la recherche d’un meilleur équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée. L’adoption mondiale des modèles à distance et hybrides est évidente, avec 73 % des entreprises interrogées signalant une croissance de leur effectif au cours de l’année écoulée.\nDéfis et opportunités\nCependant, la transition vers le travail à distance présente des défis qui nécessitent une attention particulière. La gestion des équipes à distance, le respect de la législation internationale du travail et l’adaptation des méthodes d’évaluation des performances figurent parmi les principales préoccupations soulevées par les personnes interrogées. Malgré ces obstacles, un nombre important d’entreprises (74 pour cent) ont réussi à réduire les coûts liés à l’espace de bureau en mettant en œuvre des modèles à distance ou hybrides.\nSi vous souhaitez accéder à tous les articles, abonnez-vous ici!",

    "text": "Hospitals face new penalties if they fail to notify Minnesotans of closures or substantial changes that can reduce local access to care, especially in rural parts of the state. State regulators met Wednesday with hospital leaders to explain the updated reporting requirements , which took effect in July and are designed to alert patients well before their local providers cut services. Under a three-year-old law, Minnesota had already hosted 17 public hearings, giving people the chance to voice concerns about everything from Allina Health’s closure of intensive care beds at its Mercy Hospital campus in Fridley, to the conversion of one of Minnesota’s smallest hospitals in Mahnomen into the state’s first rural emergency center with no inpatient beds. But lawmakers sought in the 2024 Legislature to add teeth to the reporting requirements, especially after a controversial hearing in January — months after Essentia Health had stopped scheduling baby deliveries at its hospital in Fosston. Under the updated law, hospitals must alert the public six months before closing or reducing operations, or explain to state regulators why they couldn’t provide that much advance notice. The state can fine hospitals up to $60,000 if they don’t provide notice and arrange public hearings so that people can voice support or opposition for their changes.",
