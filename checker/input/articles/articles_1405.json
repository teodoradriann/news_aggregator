    "text": "Australia face an uphill battle in their hopes of emulating their breakthrough bronze medal of three years ago when the Paris Olympics tournament tips off this weekend.\nBoomers legend Shane Heal is confident the Aussies can survive their intimidating draw to make the quarter-finals and play their way into the final four to have a shot at a medal.\nBut he is concerned the controversial omission of defensive specialist Matisse Thybulle could cost Brian Goorjian and his team when they match up against gigantic superstars like Greek lynchpin Giannis Antetokounmpo, French phenom Victor Wembanyama or Team USA’s tall timber.\nThe Boomers have not only been drawn in the dreaded “Group of Death” for the 12-team competition but they have slipped down the global pecking order since Patty Mills led them to their famous “rose gold” third-placed finish in Tokyo.\nOlympic Games Paris 2024.

Live & On Demand. 4K. 8 Exclusive International channels from Eurosport, Viacom18 and Sky NZ, only on Stan Sport .\nFor Mills and long-time teammate Joe Ingles, this is their last chance to claim another medal at a major tournament after the disappointing 10th-placed finish at last year’s World Cup.\nAnd they have to negotiate easily the toughest of the three pools of four with a Canada side stacked with elite NBA talent, Greece led by Antetokounmpo and perennial contenders Spain standing in their way.\nThybulle has his limitations as a scorer but Heal, who will be part of Stan Sport’s Olympics basketball coverage, said the Boomers could miss his extra length on the wings.\nIt was surprising to see a veteran like Matthew Dellavedova, natural treasure that he is, and Tasmania JackJumpers forward Jack McVeigh get the nod ahead of him.\n“I was shocked that they didn’t take Matisse Thybulle,” Heal told The Roar .\nPatty Mills and Matisse Thybulle at the Paris Olympics. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n“I thought he was one of their key guys and I’m still scratching my head about how he’s not in there because you’d think that he would have played a major role, particularly in some of the defensive assignments he would have got, even in the pool games.”\nFor Goorjian’s squad to make it to the pointy end of the Olympics, the young guns need to fire.\nJosh Giddey has been charged with the responsibility of running the offence while fellow NBA lottery pick Dyson Daniels will be given the task of leading the perimeter defence.\n“Some of the older guys will be playing their last Olympics with Joe Ingles and Patty Mills but with the new guys coming in, it’s Josh Giddey’s team now,” Heal said.\n“With Dyson Daniels and Josh Green and these younger guys coming through, it’s a changing of the guard, but we’ve put together a really talented squad and they’ve got belief.\nShane Heal is a part of Stan Sport’s Olympics lineup, the only place to watch every event from Paris 2024 ad-free, live and on demand with 4K. With exclusive features including international multi-language channels and minis, go to Stan.com.au/Olympics for more info.\n“I think they’re going to be in the mix for a medal.\n“Giddey showed at the World Cup he’s up to this level. Even though the team didn’t perform that well, he had an amazing tournament and I think he’ll only grow from there.\n“He’s an elite point guard in the world and I think the next NBA season with Chicago, I think he’s going to take another step forward as well.\n“I think had we had a few more shooters on the perimeter, it would make it a little bit easier for him.”\nMore Olympics 'To target the Games is to target France': Arson attacks leave Paris in chaos hours from Olympic opening ceremony 'Smash the bastards': How an iconic Bob Hawke quip inspired Aussie sevens to USA annihilation in Olympic quarter-final 'Heads up their bums': Former Wallaby, Socceroo torch Matildas for 'believing their own hype' after Olympic horror show When do Australia's rugby sevens play their Olympics semi-final and how do I watch it?

I think that’s what we were built on – grit and determination and toughness but it felt like we had shooters.\n“It’s a bit of a weakness for the Boomers and it’s one of the areas that I’m a little bit concerned about. If Paddy isn’t hitting, then we don’t have another guy that’s known as a knockdown shooter.”\nHeal thinks Australia’s frontcourt rotations of Jock Landale, Duop Reath, the ever-reliable Nick Kay and back-up centre Will Magnay will be imposing presences in the paint.\n“I think Magnay was a good selection because he’s a real big body and he’s a shot blocker,” Heal added. “He’s more of a roller to the basket than anything else, but he’s a big, tough guy. I think he had some legitimate size for us.\n“Nick Kay has been around for a while, is a great defender and plays a really good role as well. He’s got that toughness that I think can complement the other pieces of the team.”\nAustralia tip off their campaign on Saturday night at 7pm (AEST) against Spain before taking on second favourites Canada on Tuesday and Greece in their final pool game next Friday.\nLeBron James is guarded heavily by Josh Green. (Photo by Christopher Pike/Getty Images)\n“Canada’s got NBA players all over the place, they’re going to be extremely tough to beat. I think they’re the second best team in the tournament,” Heal said.\n“They’re a little bit outside our reach. I hope I’m wrong, but they’ve got some legitimate NBA superstars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. And the core of that group played together in the World Cup, when they medalled (snaring bronze by beating USA).\n“They’re going to be better than what they were last time. Then they’ve added Jamal Murray, an NBA champion, and Andrew Wiggins.\n“I think we can beat Spain and Greece. And we have to. I mean, if we don’t, then we’re not going through. I don’t think Spain’s the same sort of level as what we’ve seen the Spanish teams in the past.\n“Greece, it’s all about shutting down Giannis, basically. Giannis is just such a unique beast that it makes that game challenging because you have to throw so many different people and double teams and clog the floor. It will allow some of their shooters to get open.\n“Landal and Reath have had a bit of experience against him and players like him (in the NBA) but I think Matisse would have been a great match-up for him. A little bit smaller, but quicker and athletic and able to get the ball out of his hands.\n“I’m not sure who else they’re going to play because it’s not a natural fit. You think a Landale probably isn’t going to have the same quickness to be able to play with him. And Reath’s used to defending bigger guys.\n“Giannis creates that match-up problem because whilst he’s the same size as those big guys, he’s got the quickness of a guard. So it’s going to be a massive challenge for the Boomers.\nIf they are to go deep in the tournament, the colossus of Team USA will be the greatest of obstacles to overcome with LeBron James, Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis and Anthony Edwards headlining an all-star roster.\nShane Heal. (Photo by Mark Evans/Getty Images)\nHeal said they have looked a bit vulnerable in their warm-up games, including a narrow win over Australia, but he suspected they were cruising before the real matches tip off.\n“Once they get their systems right, they get their roles, they’re used to playing with each other, I think it’s going to be really difficult for anyone to beat them,” Heal predicted.\n“I think Canada’s the best chance because they’ve got the firepower to really get hot. I’m not saying that they’re unbeatable, but I think you’re going to have to play really, really well and catch them on a bad night if you’re going to beat them.”\nAnd while Heal has faith that the Boomers can overcome the odds to be one of the last four teams standing, he said it has never been tougher at the top with the rise of teams like Serbia, Canada, Germany and France.\n“I just want to make sure the public understand how difficult it is. They’re going to have to win massive games to get into the top four,” he said.\n“We’ve got more talent than we’ve ever had before, but it’s really tough to do it. They’re capable, and I think that they’ll get their opportunities. It’s just going to come down to whether you win those big crossover games against powerful opposition.”\nThe Barkley incident lives on The most famous moment of Heal’s career occurred 28 years ago when he was involved in a fracas with American superstar Charles Barkley in a warm-up match before the Atlanta Olympics.\nHeal embodied the Boomers’ spirit of never backing down to anyone when he chest-bumped his much bigger superstar opponent in one of the iconic incidents in Australian sporting folklore.\nWith the Olympics rolling around, he probably gets asked about it again.\n“It’s not just when the Olympics are on, I reckon I get asked about that every second day,” he said with a laugh.\n“It’s resonated in people’s minds from back in the day as something they think of immediately.\n“Some people don’t let the facts stand in the way of the story. They are like ‘oh, I remember when you got into it with that big Shaquille O’Neal’. And I’m like ‘yeah, close’.\n“It’s the typical Australian way because everyone remembers the fight. I feel like saying ‘you know I had eight threes in that game, how about you remember that?’ It’s funny.”\nBack then when the US were considered unbeatable, Heal and his contemporaries like Andrew Gaze would often say that they weren’t invincible and the day would come when another team would knock them off their throne.\nIt was only a relatively short time later that the unthinkable happened in the 2004 Olympics at Athens when they returned home with the bronze after Argentina beat them in the semis and then knocked over Italy in the gold medal game.\n“At that time they were pretty invincible with the team and the legends that they put together,” Heal said of the 1996 line-up which also featured Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, John Stockton and Karl Malone.\n“But it’s interesting how time evolves as well and it was only a few years later when they lost.”\nParis Olympics men’s basketball tournament Boomers schedule Saturday, July 27: Paris 2024 Olympics | Boomers vs Spain | Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Lille – France 5:00pm (AWST) 6:00pm (ACST) 7:00pm (AEST)\nTuesday, July 30: Paris 2024 Olympics | Boomers vs Canada | Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Lille – France 7:30pm (AWST) 8:30pm (ACST) 9:30pm (AEST)\nFriday, August 2: Paris 2024 Olympics | Boomers vs Greece| Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Lille – France 7:30pm (AWST) 8:30pm (ACST) 9:30pm (AEST)\nSquads Group A: Canada, Greece, Australia, Spain\nGroup B: Germany, France, Brazil, Japan\nGroup C: USA, Serbia, Puerto Rico, South Sudan\nAustralia: Dyson Daniels, Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum, Josh Giddey, Josh Green, Joe Ingles, Nick Kay, Jock Landale, Will Magnay, Jack McVeigh, Patty Mills, Duop Reath\nBrazil: Marcelinho Huertas, Yago Santos, Raul Neto, Alexey Borges, Elinho Corazza, Georginho de Paula, Vitor Benite, Léo Meindl, Gui Santos, Didi Louzada, Bruno Caboclo, Joao Cardoso, Lucas Dias, Cristiano Felício\nCanada: Nickeil Alexander-Walker, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Luguentz Dort, Melvin Ejim, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Trey Lyles, Jamal Murray, Andrew Nembhard, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell\nFrance: Andrew Albicy, Nicolas Batum, Isaia Cordinier, Bilal Coulibaly, Nando De Colo, Evan Fournier, Rudy Gobert, Mathias Lessort, Frank Ntilikina, Matthew Strazel, Victor Wembanyama, Guerschon Yabusele\nGermany: Isaac Bonga, Daniel Theis, Oscar Da Silva, Johannes Thiemann, Johannes Voigtmann, Niels Giffey, Maodo Lo, Franz Wagner, Andreas Obst, Moritz Wagner, Dennis Schroder, Nick Weiler-Babb\nGreece: Kostas Papanikolaou, Nick Calathes, Giannoulis Larentzakis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Georgios Papagiannis, Konstantinos Mitoglou, Thomas Walkup, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Vassilis Charalampopoulos, Dimitris Moraitis, Panagiotis Kalaitzakis, Vassilis Toliopoulos\n(Photo by Kelly Defina/Getty Images)\nJapan: Yuki Togashi, Akira Jacobs, Yuki Kawamura, Makoto Hiejima, Kai Toews, Rui Hachimura, Yuta Watanabe, Yudai Baba, Josh Hawkinson, Keisei Tominaga, Hugh Watanabe, Yoshii Hirotaka\nPuerto Rico: Arnaldo Toro, Ismael Romero, Chris Ortiz, Stephen Thompson, Tremont Waters, George Conditt IV, Isaiah Piñeiro, José Alvarado, Jordan Howard, Gian Clavell, Aleem Ford, Davon Reed\nSerbia: Aleska Avramovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Dejan Davidovic, Ognjen Dobric, Marko Guduric, Ognjen Jaramaz, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Jovic, Vladimir Lucic, Vanja Marinkovic, Vasilije Micic, Nikola Milutinov, Filip Petrusev, Uros Plavsic, Aleksej Pokusevski, Dusan Ristic\nSouth Sudan: Junior Madut, Nuni Omot, Carlik Jones, Khaman Maluach, Kuany Kuany, Marial Shayok, Deng Acuoth, Majok Deng, Peter Jok, Koch Bar, Wenyen Gabriel, Sunday Dech.\nSpain: Alex Abrines, Santi Aldama, Dario Brizuela, Lorenzo Brown, Alberto Diaz, Rudy Fernandez, Usman Garuba, Juancho Hernangomez, Willy Hernangomez, Sergio Llull, Xabi Lopez Arostegui, Jaime Pradilla\nUSA: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Davis, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, Derrick White",

    "text": "El PSOE anuncia una reforma legal para penalizar a los burdeles y erradicar la prostitución Los socialistas recuperarán la ley abolicionista que quedó a medias en el Congreso en la anterior legislatura MadridEn la anterior legislatura el PSOE ya intentó avanzar en la abolición de la prostitución con [ una proposición de ley que no culminó su recorrido parlamentario en el Congreso](https://www.ara.cat/societat/comuns-desmarquen-votaran-no-tramitar-llei-abolicionista-psoe_1_4395920.html). Pero la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, ha anunciado este jueves que los socialistas volverán a intentarlo. En una comparecencia en la cámara baja para presentar las líneas generales del departamento que encabeza, Redondo ha explicado que el PSOE presentará \"próximamente\" una iniciativa para penalizar a los propietarios de los inmuebles donde se produzca una situación de explotación sexual (lo que se conoce como el delito de latercería locativa). Este delito quedará recogido en el Código Penal. \"Es un primer paso\", explicó Redondo, que avanzó que a lo largo de la legislatura irá \"poniendo los ingredientes\" para \"erradicar\" la explotación sexual. \"El abolicionismo es una finalidad\", aseveró. En este sentido, ha admitido que también será necesario ofrecer una alternativa de vida digna para las 60.000 mujeres que están en situación de prostitución en España, muchas de ellas de origen migrante, y que necesitan una solución residencial y laboral.- _BK_COD_ En la proposición de ley registrada en la anterior legislatura, el PSOE planteaba castigar con penas de entre dos y cuatro años de prisión y multa de 18 a 24 meses a quienes \"con ánimo de lucro y de manera habitual destine un inmueble, local o establecimiento, abierto o no al público, o cualquier otro espacio, a promover, favorecer o facilitar la prostitución de otra persona”. Incluso cuando esta situación se produjera \"con su consentimiento\". Esto abría la puerta a sancionar a mujeres –propietarias del piso– que aseguraran que ejercían la prostitución por voluntad propia. Algunos colectivos de trabajadoras sexuales del Estado han denunciado reiteradamente que esto \"criminaliza\" a aquellas mujeres que \"se organizan, trabajan y viven en el mismo sitio\". Y, de hecho, este debate genera división a la izquierda y al propio gobierno de coalición. Los comunes, que defienden un planteamiento que regula la prostitución en lugar de abolirla –es decir, reconocer los derechos de las trabajadoras sexuales en lugar de perseguir estas prácticas– se desmarcaron y votaron en contra de tramitar la norma de los socialistas. Ahora bien, Podemos votó a favor. ERC, otro de los socios de la coalición, también se opuso. En cambio el PP le apoyó. Unos posicionamientos que previsiblemente se repetirán esta legislatura, en la que los socialistas ya han avisado a la convención política de este fin de semana de que recuperarían su hoja de ruta para perseguir el proxenetismo y abolir la prostitución.",

[AFP](mailto:falecomuai@uai.com.br) Publicado em: 26/09/2024 16:54 | Atualizado em: 26/09/2024 16:57 |Mahmoud ZAYYAT/AFP| Israel prometeu, nesta quinta-feira (26), que continuará lutando contra o movimento islamista Hezbollah no Líbano \"até a vitória\" e rejeitou um pedido conjunto de um cessar-fogo de 21 dias feito por Estados Unidos, União Europeia e vários países árabes. Pelo quarto dia consecutivo, efetuou uma série de bombardeios contra redutos do Hezbollah no Líbano, enquanto o grupo apoiado pelo Irã disparou mais uma vez projéteis contra complexos militares israelenses. Israel indicou que matou o chefe da unidade de drones do Hezbollah, Mohamed Srur, em \"bombardeios de precisão\" no subúrbio sul de Beirute. Uma fonte da milícia pró-iraniana já havia informado anteriormente que esse comandante foi o alvo de um ataque na região, que, segundo o Ministério da Saúde libanês, deixou dois mortos e 15 feridos. Os bombardeios também atingiram o leste do Líbano, outro reduto do Hezbollah, onde 20 pessoas, quase todas de nacionalidade síria, morreram na cidade de Yunin, apontou o ministério. \"É indescritível, foi uma das piores noites das nossas vidas. Como se houvesse apenas um segundo entre a vida e a morte\", disse à AFP Fadia Rafic Yaghi, moradora da região, de 70 anos. O Exército israelense indicou que os seus aviões atacaram nesta quinta 75 alvos do Hezbollah no sul e leste do Líbano e que o grupo islamista havia disparado 80 \"projéteis\" contra Israel. \"Uma chance à diplomacia\" Os bombardeios israelenses mataram mais de 600 pessoas desde segunda-feira, incluindo muitos civis, e forçaram 90 mil a fugir das suas casas no Líbano, segundo a ONU. Entre elas, mais de 31 mil entraram na Síria, de acordo com as autoridades libanesas. Desde que começou a guerra na Faixa de Gaza entre Israel e o movimento palestino Hamas, em 7 de outubro de 2023, pelo menos 1.540 pessoas morreram no Líbano devido aos bombardeios israelenses, no contexto dos confrontos transfronteiriços com o Hezbollah, aliado do Hamas. Os duelos de artilharia se intensificaram depois das detonações mortais dos dispositivos de comunicação de membros do movimento libanês, atribuídos a Israel, em 17 e 18 de setembro, e de um bombardeio israelense em 20 de setembro em um subúrbio do sul de Beirute, que decapitou a unidade de elite Radwan do grupo pró-iraniano. Diante da escalada que ameaça arrastar toda a região para a guerra, Estados Unidos, França e outros aliados, incluindo os países árabes, fizeram um apelo conjunto a um cessar-fogo de 21 dias, a fim de \"dar uma chance à diplomacia\", diz um comunicado divulgado pela Casa Branca. Mas o primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejeitou energicamente o apelo e ordenou às suas tropas que continuassem a combater o Hezbollah \"com toda a força necessária\". Seus ministros das Relações Exteriores e das Finanças, Israel Katz e Bezalel Smotrich (extrema direita), também recusaram a ideia de um cessar-fogo. Israel anunciou em meados de setembro que o \"centro de gravidade\" da guerra iniciada contra o Hamas se deslocava para o norte, na fronteira com o Líbano. Seu objetivo, afirmou, é garantir o retorno às suas casas de dezenas de milhares de habitantes do norte deslocados pelas hostilidades com o Hezbollah. Guerra total \"devastadora\" O secretário de Defesa dos Estados Unidos, Lloyd Austin, advertiu que \"uma guerra total seria devastadora para Israel e Líbano\" e disse que um cessar-fogo no Líbano poderia contribuir para alcançar um acordo de trégua em Gaza. O Hezbollah prometeu continuar combatendo Israel \"até o fim da agressão em Gaza\". O comandante do Estado-Maior do Exército Israelense, Herzi Halevi, pediu na quarta-feira a seus soldados que se preparassem para uma \"possível\" ofensiva terrestre no Líbano. O Ministério da Defesa israelense anunciou nesta quinta que recebeu um novo pacote de ajuda militar dos Estados Unidos, no valor de 8,7 bilhões de dólares (47,32 bilhões de reais), \"em apoio ao esforço militar\" do país. Apesar do agravamento dos confrontos com o Hezbollah, Israel continua sua ofensiva em Gaza, onde a Defesa Civil informou que 15 pessoas morreram no bombardeio de uma escola que abrigava deslocados no campo de Jabaliya, no norte. Este conflito eclodiu com o ataque do Hamas em 7 de outubro, que deixou 1.205 mortos em Israel, a maioria civis, segundo uma contagem da AFP baseada em números oficiais israelenses que inclui reféns que morreram no cativeiro em Gaza. Das 251 pessoas raptadas, 97 permanecem em Gaza, 33 das quais foram declaradas mortas pelo Exército. Em retaliação, Israel lançou uma ofensiva na Faixa de Gaza que já deixou 41.534 mortos, a maioria civis, segundo dados do Ministério da Saúde do governo do Hamas, considerados confiáveis pela ONU.",

    "text": "“And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, And those who fear Your name, small and great, And should destroy those who destroy the Earth.” -Rev. 11:18 Bill Gates, ever the demented snake oil salesman, has long argued in favor of a bizarre plan to fight global warming by using experimental geoengineering to partially block the sun’s rays from reaching Earth. Well, he’s apparently about to get his wish. Scientists plan to begin pumping chemicals into the sky over the next few weeks and months from several countries around the globe, including the U.S., Australia and Israel. The idea, [promoted by](https://slaynews.com/news/cbs-news-pushes-bill-gates-plan-fight-climate-change-blocking-sun/) Gates and leftist billionaire [George Soros](https://slaynews.com/news/george-soros-pushes-plan-fight-climate-change-blocking-sunlight/), involves pumping manmade white clouds containing chalk dust and other chemicals into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the Earth’s surface. Blocking the sun’s light would allegedly lower the planet’s temperature enough to reverse global warming. Never mind that fruit trees and vegetables require sunlight in order to grow and produce food for the masses. Not to mention, sunlight is the primary source of critical Vitamin D, an essential nutrient for human immunity. Gates, a known eugenicist who goes around giving talks about how we need to reduce the global population, likely sees these dark possibilities as exciting side effects of the nefarious sun-blocking plan. Soros is similarly excited about the plan. He says the technology will help to prevent ice from melting in Greenland, which he claims could doom human civilization. How ironic that the very globalists who are doing everything in their power to destroy human civilization claim to be worried that global warming might speed up the process. Globalists like Bill Gates and George Soros are doing harm to the environment through their genocidal climate agenda on multiple levels. They advocate blanketing our fertile farmland with toxic solar panels, while filling more acres of farmland with wind turbines that kill birds and other wildlife. They also push electric cars which run on toxic lithium batteries that are going to create an environmental nightmare in the years ahead because, like with the solar panels, there’s no way to safely dispose of them. Chloe Aiello of Inc. magazine reported on February 13, 2024, that a [Bill Gates-Backed Startup Just Raised $145 Million to Source Lithium-Ion Batteries for Electric Vehicles](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/smallbusiness/this-bill-gates-backed-startup-just-raised-145-million-to-source-lithium-ion-batteries-for-electric-vehicles/ar-BB1ihVhg). Much of the lithium mined in the world today is done on the backs of child labor in poor countries of Africa and Asia. But don’t tell that to Bill Gates, George Soros, Larry Fink and their buddies at the World Economic Forum. Despite their destructive plans, these globalists insist they are our saviors and we should look to them for answers on how to live a sustainable lifestyle. Please. About the devious sun-blocking formula, Soros said: “Our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet would increase the level of the oceans by 7 meters. That poses a threat to the survival of our civilization.” Of course this is all nonsense meant to stoke fear. A fearful population will beg for solutions to the imaginary problem, inviting their own enslavement. More than 20 years ago, Al Gore made the exact same dire predictions about ice melting, polar bears dying, hurricanes increasing, and whole cities being submerged in water. None of these apocalyptic predictions have materialized. According to a report by [Slay News](https://slaynews.com/news/bill-gates-plan-fight-climate-change-blocking-sun-begins/), the tactics advocated by Bill Gates involve spraying aerosol concentrations into the stratosphere to reflect solar radiation away from the Earth. Gates has been funding a major project at Harvard using balloons to deploy aerosols. The Harvard project was shut down following public backlash. But now, the Wall Street Journal is [reporting](https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/geoengineering-projects-cool-planet-weather-f0619bf7) that another group of scientists has been advancing Gates’ idiotic and, frankly, dangerous plan. Marine Cloud Brightening is a research project led by Southern Cross University as part of the $64.55 million, or 100 million Australian dollars, Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program. The program involves modifying clouds to make them reflect sunlight away from the Earth to supposedly stop global warming. Slay News reports: “This week, researchers aboard a ship off the northeastern coast of Australia near the Whitsunday Islands started spraying a briny mixture through high-pressure nozzles into the air in an attempt to brighten low-altitude clouds that form over the ocean. “Scientists hope bigger, brighter clouds will reflect sunlight away from the Earth, shade the ocean surface, and cool the waters around the Great Barrier Reef.” In Israel, another startup called Stardust Solutions has begun testing a system to disperse a cloud of tiny reflective particles about 60,000 feet in altitude. These geoengineered clouds reflect sunlight away from Earth to cool the atmosphere in a concept known as solar radiation management. And, in Massachusetts, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution are preparing to pour 6,000 gallons of a liquid solution of sodium hydroxide, a component of lye, into the ocean 10 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard this summer. Some would argue that “cloud seeding” has been going on for years. Take a look at this shot I took of the sky above my house a few weeks ago. Does the sky in the photo above look normal? With all these chemicals being sprayed above us, what could possibly go wrong? Let’s pray this ill-advised experiment fizzles out before it can do too much damage.",
