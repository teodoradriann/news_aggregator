    "title": "Mumbai: JNPA To Launch Electric Ferry Boat Service To Gateway Of India And Bhaucha Dhakka In January 2025",
    "text": "Mumbai: Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA) has announced the launch of an electrical ferry boat from JNPA to Mumbai and will start operation next month. The aim is to bring a zero-emission environment-friendly ferry boat for the public.\nOperating from the Gateway of India to JNPA in the sea, and from the Bhaucha Dhakka to JNPA during the foul season, these boats promise to make commuting more convenient and hassle-free for travellers.\nThe boat will significantly shorten the journey from Mumbai to Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNP), by 20 minutes which makes a total journey of 30-40 minutes. The new boat also prioritizes passage comfort with air-conditioned seating arrangements, improving the travel experience.\nThe pollution-free and environment-friendly boat, backed by Harit Sagar or the “Green Port” initiative, focuses on sustainable port operations and reducing the environmental impact launched by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPS&W). It aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2047 and enhance renewable energy usage by 60% across major ports, JNPA said in a statement.\nThese fast and efficient ferry boats can comfortably accommodate 20-24 passengers at a time, offering a seamless travelling experience with an easy online ticketing system and check-in options while the tickets will continue to be issued by JNPA.",

    "title": "Tattooing has held a long tradition in Christianity − dating back to Jesus’ crucifixion",
    "text": "Historically, many Christians got tattoos around Holy Week − usually a cross − to honor Christ’s martyrdom. Holy Week and Easter are perhaps the most important days in the Christian calendar. Many associate those celebrations with church services, processions, candles, incense, fasting, and penances. However, there is another tradition that many Christians follow – that of tattooing. Historically, Easter was an important time for tattoos among some Christian groups. Today, Christian tattooing happens in many parts of the world and all year around. Some Christians visiting Jerusalem around Easter will get a tattoo of a cross, or a lamb, usually on their forearms. As a sociologist of religion and a Jesuit Catholic priest, I have long studied tattoos as religious practices . I have interviewed tattoo artists in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Loreto in Italy who have been continuing and recreating the tradition of Christian tattooing. Evidence is clear the practice started shortly after Jesus’ crucifixion and spread across Europe in later centuries. The first Christian tattoos The Romans, like the Greeks, tattooed slaves and prisoners, usually with letters or words on their foreheads that indicated their crime. Soon after Jesus’ death, around the year 30 C.E., they started enslaving and tattooing Christians with the marks “AM” – meaning “ad metalla,” or condemned to work in the mines, a punishment that often resulted in death. Almost at the same time, Christians who were not enslaved got tattoos of the early Christian signs such as fish or lambs in solidarity and to show that they identified with Jesus. There were no specific words in Latin or Greek for tattooing , so the words “stizo,” “signum” and “stigma” were used. The word stigma also referred to the marks of nails on Jesus’ hands and foot, as a result of his crucifixion. Christians often got their own “stigmas”: a sign – usually a cross – in Jerusalem to honor Christ’s martyrdom. The beginning of a tradition There are several documented accounts of the tradition. One from the third century mentions Christians in present-day Egypt and Syria getting tattoos of fish and crosses. Another tells about the commentary that Procopius of Gaza, a theologian who lived between 475 and 538 C.E., wrote on the Book of Isaiah after he found that many Christians living in the Holy Land had a cross tattooed on their wrists. “Still others will write on their hand, ‘The Lord’s,’ and will take the name Israel,” he noted. When a plague hit the Scythians, nomadic people living around the Black Sea, in 600 C.E., tattoos were believed to provide protection from the deadly disease. Theophylact Simocatta , one of the last historians of late antiquity, mentioned that missionaries among them recommended that “the foreheads of the young be tattooed with this very sign” – meaning that of a cross. Many testimonies mentioned Crusaders and pilgrims returning from the Holy Land with a tattoo during the Middle Ages – a tradition that continued in early modern times , between the 16th and 18th centuries. Christian tattoos in Great Britain Other cultures used tattoos in different ways. When Romans came in contact with the Celts tribes that inhabited the British Isles in 400 C.E., they called them Picts because they were covered in body art . Pope Gregory the Great sent envoys to convert the Celts to Christianity, followed by a visit from another Vatican delegation. While missionaries were against “pagan tattooing,” both delegations agreed that tattoos done for the Christian god were fine. The members of the second delegation in the late 700s even said, “If anyone were to undergo this injury of staining for the sake of God, he would receive a great reward for it .” Similar was the conclusion of the Northumbria Council , a church gathering in Northern England in 787: Tattoos done for the right god were acceptable. At that time, the Anglo-Saxon elite also had tattoos; the bishop of York, Saint Wilfrid , for example, got a tattoo of a cross. Tattoos in Italy Around the 1300s, as the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land were losing control with the coming of the Ottomans, there appeared in Italy shrines called “Sacri Monti.” These shrines were placed on “holy mountains” where devotees could pilgrimage safely, instead of risking their lives going to Jerusalem, which by then was under the control of the Ottomans. These shrines were established in cities such as Naples, Varallo, and Loreto. Pilgrims could get tattoos in some of these shrines. One place was Loreto’s sanctuary, established in the early 1300s. A relic from the “Holy House,” which, according to the Christian tradition, is the house where the Virgin Mary is believed to have received the news that she will bear God’s son, was brought to Loreto’s sanctuary. Tattooing in Loreto’s sanctuary was a communal activity, done by carpenters, shoemakers, and artisans, who brought their stalls and tools to the main square during the days of celebrations and tattooed whoever wanted to get a mark of their devotion. These tattoos typically used wood planks for transferring the design on the body, like a stamp. However, the city of Loreto banned tattooing for hygienic reasons in 1871, according to Caterina Pigorini Beri , an anthropologist, who was one of the first to document the practice. But people kept getting them. A shoemaker, Leonardo Conditti , was among those who kept doing tattoos in hiding during the 1940s. From the 1200s to the 1700s, the custom of Christian tattooing was prevalent in Europe among peasants, seafarers, soldiers, and artisans as much as among nuns and monks. They were getting crosses, images of the Virgin Mary, the name of Jesus, and some sentences from the Bible. Following the Renaissance, however, European culture came to associate tattoos with those considered “uncivilized ,” such as people in the colonies, criminals, and poorer Catholics. Many European intellectuals viewed Catholicism as a superstition more than a real religion. The word “tattoo” came to the Western languages after the French admiral and explorer Louis de Bougainville and British explorer James Cook returned from their trips to the South Pacific at the end of the 1700s. There, they saw local people getting marks on their bodies and using the word “tatau” to name those drawings. However, it does not mean that tattoos came back at that time. They had never left. The practice today These days, some churches in the Middle East , such as some Coptic Christian churches in Egypt, incorporate the practice of getting a tattoo into the baptismal rituals. Indeed, Holy Land tattooing has never stopped. Wassim Razzouk , whom I interviewed in 2022, is a 27th-generation tattooist – his family has been marking pilgrims in Jerusalem since 1300 . Razzouk claims to have some of the 500-year-old wood planks his family used for tattooing. Another tattoo artist whom I interviewed, Walid Ayash, does pilgrimage tattoos for those who visit the Nativity church in Bethlehem – a beloved custom among Arab Christians. He said that tattooing happens all year around, as long as there are pilgrims visiting the Nativity church. Although this year, as a result of the war in Gaza, Israeli authorities have restricted access to Jerusalem and Bethlehem. In Italy, artist Jonatal Carducci is working on recovering the tradition of religious tattooing in Loreto. In a 2023 interview with me, he explained how he has painstakingly replicated the designs of the wood planks, which are both in the Museum of the Holy House and the Folkloric Museum of Rome. In 2019, he opened a parlor where Leonardo Conditti used to work. Visitors to the parlor can choose among more than 60 designs for their tattoos, including the Virgin Mary of Loreto, crosses and representations of Jesus’ heart. This Easter, as some Christians get tattoos, this history might serve as a reminder of tattooing as a legitimate Christian practice, one that has been in use since the beginnings of the Common Era.

    "text": "Desde a década de 90 que a Organização das Nações Unidas dispõe de um índice de cariz qualitativo que pretende enfatizar a qualidade de vida das populações em cada território em detrimento da precedente visão puramente quantitativa da medição do conceito de desenvolvimento.\nImaginemos os representantes dos países sentados a discutir e a analisar dados sobre a qualidade de vida, o crescimento económico e aspetos de cariz social dos seus países sem conseguirem definir quadros de comparação justa e equitativa.\nDando resposta a esta situação, Amartya Sen, investigador e economista das Nações Unidas, propôs uma teoria baseada no desenvolvimento humano, conduzindo assim ao PNUD, Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento, que elabora um relatório comparativo dos países através de um índice denominado de IDH- Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano.\nO Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano tem em conta três dimensões, o padrão de vida digno, a vida longa e saudável e o conhecimento, baseado em quatro indicadores principais: esperança média de vida, anos de escolaridade esperados e anos médios de escolarização e ainda o rendimento per capita.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nIsto parece tudo bastante complexo, não fosse o autor ter facilitado a vida de todos, transformando este Índice num indicador que varia entre 0 e 1, e onde cada país que se encontre mais próximo de 1 apresenta mais qualidade de vida aos seus cidadãos, ou seja, é mais desenvolvido.\nA questão que se coloca agora é: quantas vezes a classe política se refere a este indicador? Qual das políticas em vigor tem em vista a melhoria do IDH de Portugal? Quais os partidos que realmente apresentam soluções para a vida dos seus cidadãos tendo em conta a realidade económica mas também a sustentabilidade da área social?\nPortugal encontra-se na 36ª posição mundial (dados de 2022), com um valor de 0,866 numa categoria de desenvolvimento muito elevado. Ainda assim, atrás de vários dos seus parceiros europeus: Espanha, França, Grécia, Polónia, Estónia, Lituânia ou Chipre.\nNão seria altura de medidas mais reformistas para fomentar a qualidade no acesso e prestação dos serviços de saúde? Não estamos num momento fulcral de investimento e desenvolvimento de políticas justas de educação com uma índole mais humanista e adequadas aos novos tempos das empresas e da inovação? Para quando um discurso político centrado no crescimento económico, mas que conduza a verdadeiro desenvolvimento humano?\nAs políticas sociais das últimas décadas deram poucos frutos ao desenvolvimento do país. Factos são factos, e Portugal, apesar de ter aumentado no Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano, tem perdido posições comparativamente com outros países que têm adotado políticas liberais focadas no crescimento e desenvolvimento económico.\nNas próximas eleições de 10 de março, gostaria de ver as propostas políticas trazerem este Índice esquecido para o debate político, porque só com medidas integradoras, reformistas, humanistas e liberais Portugal poderá dar o tal salto de gigante que há vários anos ambiciona.\nQue se façam compromissos, que se construam alternativas, mas não se perca a oportunidade de trazer projetos e ideias para o país que está estagnado e com cheiro a mofo de tanto socialismo de trazer por casa.\nReceba um alerta sempre que Filipe Vilar publique um novo artigo.\nSeguir",

    "text": "En Chartreuse, un loup attaque en plein village\nUne vache a été tuée par des loups de nuit, en plein dans le village de Saint-Hugues-de-Chartreuse. Ce n'est pas la première fois que les prédateurs attaquent dans ce village de basse montagne. La proximité avec les habitations interroge les habitants.\nLa carcasse dit la violence de l'attaque : les côtes de la vache sont déchiquetées, et le cou entièrement ouvert. La bête, une Galloway d'un an, a été attaquée dans la nuit du vendredi 28 février au samedi 1er mars. Elle était là avec le reste du troupeau, dans un enclos protégé, au cœur du village de Saint-Hugues-de-Chartreuse, qui dépend de la commune de Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.\nDeuxième attaque en un an\nComme le précise le Dauphiné Libéré, le troupeau était situé au pied d'un restaurant, La Cabine, à proximité immédiate de l'église. Franck, à la tête du restaurant, a l'habitude de jeter un œil sur ces Galloway, des vaches touffues, plus petites que d'autres races, faites pour passer l'hiver dehors : \"J'ai entendu pas mal de bruit. Dans la nuit, il y a eu un meuglement, plus révélateur que d'autres soirs. Et tôt le lendemain matin, on a constaté qu'il y avait eu un problème\" raconte-t-il à ici Isère.\nLa bête appartenait à Léa Diederichs et son père Frédéric, tous les deux à la tête de La Ferme de Saint-Hugues. \"Les vaches étaient dans un parc électrique avec double clôture, au cœur du village. On a fait exprès de les laisser au centre du village pour essayer d'échapper aux prédations du loup, car nous avons déjà eu une attaque l'année dernière\" détaille Léa.\nEn mai 2024, un veau appartenant aux Diederichs a disparu, après une attaque en fin de journée, alors que la nuit n'était pas encore tombée.\n\"Les loups ont élu domicile dans le village\"\nLa proximité des attaques avec des lieux de vie et des lieux de passage humains, à basse altitude (environ 900 mètres) qui plus est, interroge Frédéric Diederichs. \"C'est là-dessus que je râle beaucoup\" peste l'éleveur, installé depuis une trentaine d'années. \"On est au cœur du village. Les loups ont été vus et revus. Un voisin en a même croisé un sur la route, un samedi matin, alors qu'il était en voiture pour aller chercher son pain. Il s'est arrêté et l'a laissé passer. Mais ça ne semble pas inquiéter grand monde...\"\n\"C'est vraiment ça qui nous inquiète, et que l'on veut mettre en évidence. Les attaques ont eu lieu en plein dans le village, proches des habitations, proches de l'école, proches des sites touristiques. Le week-end dernier (celui du 1er mars, NDLR), c'était en pleine période de vacances scolaires\" abonde Léa.\n\"Au moins une fois par semaine, on entend quelqu'un qui dit avoir vu un loup dans le coin. Ils ont élu domicile dans le village\" regrette Frédéric, démuni car privé de tirs d'effarouchement pour le moment. \"Quelques voisins qui faisaient de la course à pied évitent maintenant de le faire le soir. Les gens qui viennent camper, se promener... Je trouve que cela devient dangereux d'arriver en Chartreuse maintenant. Ça fait un peu peur\".\n\"Lorsque les gens se feront manger leur chat...\"\n\"Aujourd'hui, les loups s'attaquent aux cheptels. Cela peut devenir dangereux, peut-être pas pour l'homme, mais pour d'autres espèces\" poursuit Léa, installée avec son père depuis un peu plus d'un an. \"Les chiens, les chats... Nous, il s'agit de nos bovins : on les aime autant que quelqu'un aime son chat. Peut-être que lorsque les gens se feront manger leur chat, ils auront une réaction identique à la nôtre...\"\nL'éleveuse se questionne même sur son avenir, quatorze mois à peine après son installation au sein de cet élevage d'une centaine de bovins, dont 70 Galloways. \"Travailler dans ces conditions, humainement, psychologiquement, pour voir ses animaux souffrir...Et surtout financièrement aussi. On a perdu une bête, cela nous fait perdre un mois de salaire.
