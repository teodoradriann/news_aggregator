    "text": "Sports documentary, Fight for Glory: 2024 World Series , profiles the rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees.\nThe three-part series by filmmaker R.J. Cutler and with executive producers including five-time World Series champion Derek Jeter, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard screens next week on Apple TV+\nR.J. Cutler said, “Our goal was to make a truly cinematic experience that celebrates the drama, emotion and beauty of baseball at its highest-stakes moment: The World Series . We wanted to put the audience right in the guts of this story– the tension, the triumph, the heartbreak. As in life, the game of baseball is never over until the final out— you feel that in this series and your heart pounds with every twist and turn.”\n“As a lifelong baseball fan, I recognise the inherent drama in almost any MLB game, but with the Dodgers and Yankees in a World Series matchup and the remarkable director R.J. Cutler covering every aspect of the clash between these two great franchises, I knew it would yield a world-class documentary,” says Ron Howard.\n​​“ Fight for Glory: 2024 World Series brings fans inside that journey like never before, capturing the intensity, sacrifices, and defining moments that make this game so special,” adds Derek Jeter. “As someone who has lived these moments firsthand, I’m proud to help share this story and give viewers an unprecedented look at what it truly takes to be World Series Champions.”\nWith special access to superstar players, managers, and their families, “Fight for Glory: 2024 World Series” immerses both new and die-hard baseball fans in an unforgettable journey through the 2024 World Series. The series weaves together the milestones, high stakes, and gripping storylines that shaped each team’s quest for the championship, told through the perspectives of players, coaches, fans, journalists, and those closest to the action. The showdown begins with a history-making opener, setting the tone for one of the most anticipated World Series in decades. But the momentum shifts in Game 2 as Shohei Ohtani’s injury delivers a devastating blow to the Dodgers, while the Yankees, on the brink of elimination, look to Aaron Judge for a spark. Just when the Dodgers seem poised to close it out, hometown hero Anthony Volpe’s heroics force a dramatic Game 5, where the Yankees begin to look like their formidable old selves—though their hopes of a comeback hang by a thread.\nBuilding on over 80 years of MLB chronicling the World Series, “Fight for Glory: 2024 World Series” takes fans deeper than ever before, offering a cinematic, all-access experience. Through exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, raw emotion, and high-stakes drama, the series expands the perspective on baseball’s biggest stage, bringing audiences closer than ever to America’s favorite pastime and the relentless pursuit of its ultimate prize. With unprecedented access to stars like Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts, and Aaron Judge, the series captures the intensity of the game from the dugout to the clubhouse, offering a rare, unfiltered look at what it takes to compete at the highest level.\nFriday, 28 March on Apple TV+",

    "text": "GEORGE TOWN: It will be a united Thaipusam this year with the involvement of both the golden and silver chariot on Jan 25.\nHindu Endowment Board chairman RSN Rayer said the board worked in unison with the Nattukotai Chettiar Temple trustees.\n\"We have held several discussions and are working towards coordinating the chariots for the procession.\n\"We share a cordial relationship with the Nattukotai Chettiar Temple trustees and are looking forward to holding a world-class Thaipusam for all to experience.\n\"We are responsible for ensuring it is carried out smoothly and is a united Thaipusam celebration.\n\"Thaipusam is for the service of the people, and we want everyone to take part.\n\"We want to show how the Hindu community can unite and celebrate Thaipusam together,\" he said during a press conference held at the Hindu Endowment Board office along Macalister Road on Friday (Dec 29).\n\"We have had several discussions with the temple to coordinate the chariots and preparations for Thaipusam.\n\"We have heard feedback from the people about the timing of the chariots as people wait for both, and sometimes it has taken a while between the arrival of the chariots.\n\"We are working on that to make it easier as there are many elderly people and families who wait to see both,\" he said.\nRayer said their focus is also to unite the Hindus in Penang and nationwide.\nNattukotai Chettiar Temple managing trustee AL Lakshmanan, said they have attended three meetings so far to prep for the celebration.\n\"We want to make sure both chariots reach the temples swiftly,\" he said.\nThe Thaipusam procession in Penang began in 1856, and the silver chariot has been used for about 120 years. The golden chariot was introduced in 2017.\nCOMPLI\nKeywords: United, Thaipusam, Golden Chariot, Silver Chariot, Hindu Endowment Board, RSN Rayer, Nattukotai Chettiar Temple, AL Lakshmanan,\nOpen Modal ×",
