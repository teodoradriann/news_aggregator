    "text": "Naciones Unidas (EFE).- El secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, [Antony Blinken](https://efe.com/mundo/2024-09-17/blinken-venezuela-gonzalez-urrutia-machado-democracia/), tachó este jueves de “total irresponsabilidad” la nueva doctrina nuclear del presidente de Rusia, Vladímir Putin, y que el Kremlin anunció como un “aviso” para que Occidente no autorice a Ucrania el empleo de misiles de gran alcance. “Es una total irresponsabilidad y creo que muchos países en el mundo lo han dicho claramente siempre que (Rusia) ha amenazando con el tema nuclear, incluido China”, afirmó el jefe de la diplomacia estadounidense en una entrevista con la cadena MSNBC desde Nueva York, con motivo de la Asamblea General de la ONU. BLINKEN VE DESACERTADO EL ANUNCIO DE PUTIN Blinken dijo que el anuncio es especialmente grave porque se produce cuando líderes de todo el mundo se encuentran reunidos en la ONU hablando, entre muchas otras cuestiones, de “la necesidad de un mayor desarme y de la no proliferación nuclear”. “Creo que (el anuncio de Rusia) será muy mal visto en todo el mundo”, agregó. LA ORDEN DE PUTIN Putin dio anoche la orden de considerar cambios en la doctrina nuclear para permitir respuestas nucleares contra naciones no nucleares que tengan apoyo de naciones nuclearizadas, en clara referencia a Ucrania, que recibe apoyo militar de Estados Unidos y otras naciones con armas nucleares. “Es un aviso que advierte de las consecuencias en caso de que esos países participen en un ataque contra nuestro país por diversos medios, no obligatoriamente nucleares”, dijo este jueves Dmitri Peskov, portavoz presidencial, en su rueda de prensa telefónica diaria. El anuncio coincide con la visita a Estados Unidos del líder ucraniano, Volodímir Zelenski, quien presentará este jueves al presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden, su plan para la victoria, que incluye garantías de seguridad y el suministro de armamento para derrotar a Rusia. sp-am",

    "title": "Binance Faces Lawsuit From Hamas Hostage And Victims' Families | Bitcoinist.com",
    "text": "In a significant development, an American mother who was taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza, along with the relatives of two men who lost their lives in a terrorist attack, has filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Binance. According to a Bloomberg [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/binance-sued-by-hamas-hostage-families-of-victims-in-attack), the lawsuit filed in a federal court in Manhattan alleges that Binance facilitated the violence perpetrated by Hamas. The lawsuit specifically targets Binance for allegedly allowing Hamas to trade on its platform. Lawsuit Accuses Binance Of Enabling Hamas Financing Per the report, the accusation has emerged due to regulatory and criminal investigations into the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, which concluded last year. As previously [reported](https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-to-step-down-4-billion-settlement/), Binance had pleaded guilty to violating sanctions and anti-money laundering (AML) laws, which US law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) believed somehow allowed groups like Hamas to evade US banking regulations. As a result, Binance is now facing a [criminal fine](https://bitcoinist.com/binance-cz-grapple-with-massive-2-7-billion-fine/) of $1.8 billion and forfeiting $2.5 billion, while its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, awaits sentencing for violating banking laws. Officials at Binance have not yet responded to the lawsuit. However, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Robert Seiden, expressed confidence that the victims are entitled to substantial damages under US law, including the Anti-terrorism Act. The government’s claims in the Binance case suggest that Hamas’s military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, utilized [Bitcoin ](https://bitcoinist.com/warning-binance-collapse-and-10-year-sentence-looms/)(BTC) transactions to raise funds for the Palestinian resistance. According to Bloomberg, Binance has admitted that at least 1.1 million transactions, valued at $899 million, were conducted by individuals residing in Iran, violating US sanctions. Strengthened Compliance Measures It is important to acknowledge that despite pleading guilty, Binance has expressed its commitment to resolving the matter with US regulators and law enforcement agencies. In November 2023, the exchange [stated ](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/leadership/binance-announcement-reaching-resolution-with-us-regulators-2904832835382364558)that it had been actively undertaking organizational and personnel restructuring, system upgrades, and establishing a new compliance standard within the industry. Notably, Binance has enhanced its in-house anti-money laundering (AML) detection and analytics capabilities. Moreover, Binance [highlighted ](https://bitcoinist.com/binance-sets-record-straight-on-anti-terrorism/)its approach to Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, becoming one of the first major exchanges outside the United States to implement mandatory KYC requirements for all users. Presently, prospective users (excluding US persons) must provide valid identification and submit a “selfie” photograph, which the crypto exchange verifies against their identification documents with the support of reputable vendors. Additionally, the exchange stated that it conducts comprehensive searches through World-Check to identify any criminal history, connections to terrorism, presence on Politically Exposed (PEP) lists, and sanctions watch lists. Compensation From Iran And Syria Despite Binance’s measures to prevent [illicit activity](https://bitcoinist.com/rundown-of-binance-charges/) within the exchange’s operations and its settlement with US authorities, the lawsuit argues that Binance’s alleged support of Hamas facilitated the financing of violent attacks and the recruitment of individuals to carry out those acts. Furthermore, the plaintiffs claim that Iran has emerged as the primary backer of Hamas terrorism, providing substantial funding and weapons supply to the group in recent years. Similarly, the complaint asserts that Syria played a significant role as one of the “cradles of Hamas terrorism” and contributed to the group’s military arsenal, leading up to an attack that took place in that country in October 2023. The plaintiffs, including Judith Raanan, the Glisko family, and Jeffrey Ludmir (uncle of Dr. Daniel Levi Ludmir), seek damages from Binance for aiding, abetting, and providing material support to a [terrorist organization](https://bitcoinist.com/former-fbi-agent-and-binance-executive-sanctioned/). Additionally, they are pursuing compensation from Iran and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

    "text": "Jennie Oh Brown ’91, flutist, is artist in residence and artistic director at the Epiphany Center for the Arts in Chicago, executive and artistic director of ensemble collective Picosa, and a faculty member at Wheaton College. She served as executive and artistic director of Ear Taxi Festival in 2021, a celebration of Chicago-centric 21st century music featuring 600 artists in performances throughout the city. Brown is an active performer throughout Chicago in many contexts, including performances with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera Orchestra, and Chicago Opera Theater. Her solo album, Giantess (Innova 2019), was featured in the Chicago Tribune’s “Best Classical Albums of 2019.” Additional albums were also released to critical acclaim, including her first solo album Looking Back: Flute Music by Joseph Schwantner* (Innova, 2015) and the Heare Ensemble’s Vox (Innova, 2020) in honor of George Crumb’s 90th birthday. Upcoming performances for Brown include Anchorage Opera and as a featured artist for the Chicago Flute Club in 2023. She serves on the board of Chamber Music America (CMA) and is program chair of the upcoming 2023 CMA national conference. She is a member of the diversity and inclusion and historical flutes committees of the National Flute Association, and she is a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Which professors influenced you the most during your time at the Bienen School of Music? Without question, the professor who had the greatest influence on me during my time at the Bienen School, and who is still very special to me to this day, is [Walfrid Kujala](https://music.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile/walfrid-kujala). He is simply a consummate pedagogue and an artist of world-class caliber. In addition to giving me thorough preparation for my performing and teaching career, he inspired me with his commitment to board service, his dedication to writing and speaking with utmost clarity and thought, and most importantly, his conviction to treat others with respect and kindness in all circumstances. Now, 30 years after graduating, I still see him at my concerts and am the grateful beneficiary of his very generous encouragement. Without exception, I think about his teaching every day of my professional career, and I remain so profoundly grateful for his continued friendship and presence in my life. Jennie Oh Brown and Professor Emeritus Walfrid Kujala Tell us about a particular experience that impacted you during your time at the Bienen School of Music. I had so many truly incredible experiences while a student, especially in concerts, but it is often the interactions with Bienen faculty that stand out to me in my memories. Remembering former principal clarinetist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Clark Brody, I recall approaching him in the hall one day to share with him how much I loved his performance in Van Cliburn’s recording of Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Fritz Reiner. His clarinet solo in the second movement is simply a divine moment in a recording that I’ve now listened to hundreds of times. Mr. Brody was startled at my mention of the decades-old recording, and he wistfully responded with gratitude, sharing how it was among the most important highlights of his career. I was so moved to hear his recollection of this experience, and how, even in a stellar career as celebrated as his, the joy of a musical life remains with these rare and exquisite artistic moments. What lesson did you learn at Bienen that has continued to resonate with you in your career? Rhythm, rhythm, and more rhythm. What is truly unifying in music as a “universal language” is rhythm. We all know those unmistakable moments when artists “lock” together in performance, feeling the pulse collaboratively in an organic yet fluid way, or when we have those wonderful a-ha moments when we truly understand polyrhythms or complex rhythmic patterns and modes. There are so many nuanced ways of understanding rhythm together. My comprehension of rhythm was foundational to my studies with Walfrid Kujala, John P. Paynter*, and [Victor Yampolsky](https://music.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile/victor-yampolsky) especially. It is now essential to my artistic process and a crucial core skill in my collaborative work. I credit my studies at the Bienen School of Music with giving me the tools necessary to learn often incredibly complicated works quickly and perform them with courage and confidence. Describe one of your career highlights. It’s probably strange to say that I’m currently living a career highlight in my full-time role at Epiphany Center for the Arts. I never knew, when I was in the thick of undergraduate life, that I could have a career that meets such a range of both my skills and passions in the field. As artist in residence, I will be pursuing long-time bucket list recording projects featuring the Bach Cello Suites (transcribed for flute) and works by Korean composers in addition to other fun performing projects in development. It’s also providing a residency for Picosa in one of Chicago’s most beautiful spaces. As artistic director, I’m developing educational opportunities and curating a concert series that opens the doors to Chicago musicians, and more. The team at Epiphany is dedicated to diverse programming across its music and visual arts programming, which also resonates with my passion to create and contribute to an artistic world that better reflects our Chicago community and beyond. I’m happy to be in touch with Bienen School alumni who are interested in Epiphany Center for the Arts! What music have you been listening to lately? Often, I listen to new album releases from friends or whatever is coming up in my concert schedule. However, I also have my musical equivalent of “comfort foods” that I turn to especially on long drives. These are albums that I discovered during those early years of my serious musical life and still hold a lot of affection for me.

    "text": "Resumen Medio Oriente, 26 de septiembre de 2024.\nA pesar de los llamados del mundo para un alto el fuego, el premier del régimen israelí, insiste en su agresión contra el Líbano, lo que ha desplazado a centenares de miles de personas.\nPor cuarto día consecutivo, el régimen israelí continuó con sus ataques contra varias regiones de El Líbano, en los que los más perjudicados son los civiles, decenas de miles que se han visto obligados a abandonar sus hogares y todo lo que tenían, para huir de los indiscriminados bombardeos israelíes.\nPero, a esa cifra se suman cientos de miles de personas que se han refugiado con familiares, amigos, en residencias privadas alquiladas o que han salido del país. Así que este número puede alcanzar hasta el medio millón de personas.\nEste jueves, el ejército israelí dijo haber bombardeado un cruce fronterizo entre El Líbano y Siria, hiriendo al menos a ocho personas. Pero, en medio de esta situación crítica, los libaneses avisan a los israelíes invasores que su patria es su línea roja.\nEn los recientes días, las fuerzas israelíes han comenzado a lanzar una serie de ataques indiscriminados contra objetivos civiles y sanitarios en el sur y el este de El Líbano, considerados los ataques más mortíferos desde la guerra israelí de 2006 contra la nación árabe, aumentando los temores y alertas a nivel internacional, de que el régimen sionista también allí cometa crímenes, a nivel de genocidio, tal como en la Franja de Gaza.\nAtaques israelíes cobran la vida de 23 refugiados sirios en Líbano Los ataques aéreos de Israel han provocado la muerte de al menos 23 refugiados sirios en el sur de El Líbano este jueves.\nLa Agencia Estatal Nacional de Noticias del Líbano ( NNA ) reportó que el ejército israelí bombardeó un edificio de tres pisos que albergaba a desplazados sirios en la ciudad de Junín, cerca de Baalbek, en el norte del valle de Bekaa.\nEl alcalde de Junín, Ali Kassas, explicó que se recuperaron los cuerpos de 23 ciudadanos sirios de entre los escombros, y agregó que cuatro sirios y cuatro libaneses resultaron heridos.\nAdemás, la Cruz Roja Libanesa informó haber recuperado nueve cadáveres, mientras que otros fueron rescatados por el servicio paramédico del Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica de El Líbano (Hezbolá) y la Defensa Civil libanesa.\nLa NNA también indicó que 11 libaneses perdieron la vida y otros nueve resultaron heridos en la ciudad sureña de Al-Karak, en el distrito de Zahle, en Bekaa.\nMás temprano ese mismo día, aviones de guerra israelíes llevaron a cabo una serie de bombardeos intensivos en las ciudades del sur de El Líbano, incluyendo Tiro, Dibba, Bidayas y Bazourieh, lo que dejó varias víctimas.\nEn respuesta, Hezbolá anunció que ha ejecutado ataques de represalia, lanzando cohetes contra los complejos militares industriales de Rafael, ubicados en la zona de Zovulon, al norte de Haifa.\nFuente: HispanTV",

Ron DeSantis ordered the flag of the State of Florida to be flown at half-staff at the Lake County Courthouse in Tavares, Florida, and the City Hall of Leesburg, Florida, from sunrise to sunset on Sunday, January 21, 2024.\nSergeant Franklin P.

Hall was shot down while on a mission assigned to the 66th Bombardment Squadron.\nThe members of his crew were found by the Germans and his remains were interred in France. After the war, Hall’s remains were placed in Normandy, but still not identified and Sergeant Hall remained listed as MIA.\nUpon notification from the Department of Defense that Sergeant Hall’s remains were identified, he will finally be laid to rest in his hometown of Leesburg, Florida, on Sunday, January 21, 2024.\nAndroid Users, Click To\nDownload The Free Press App And Never Miss A Story.
