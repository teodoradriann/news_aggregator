    "text": "Hillsong Church has now dropped to five campuses in America, following an announcement that Hillsong San Francisco is leaving the global Australia-based megachurch, leaders shared Sunday .\nAfter being rocked by scandals for years, 11 of 16 of the church’s U.S. campuses have left the Hillsong Brand. Hillsong Church now has just five U.S. locations: Los Angeles and Orange County in California, along with New York City, New Jersey, and Boston, according to its website .\nThe latest departure reportedly stems from pastors Brenden and Jacqui Brown, who lead Hillsong San Francisco, desire to follow God’s vision.\nThe Browns had felt God calling them to a “fresh vision” for their church, said Sam Lopez, lead pastor at Hillsong California, during a service at his church this weekend. The separation had been under discussion for around two years and church leaders were simply waiting for the right time to do it.\nHillsong San Francisco will now be independently run and operated under the new name Heirs Church .\nWorship service at Hillsong Church in San Francisco, California in 2019. (Photo via social media) Lopez insisted that nothing happened to cause this decision and that the Browns are leaving with Hillsong’s blessing.\n“In my conversations with a couple of people in our church, I’m starting to realize that this isn’t very normal. . .The tone I keep getting is like, ‘So what happened?’ And let me tell you, nothing happened,” Lopez said.\n“And then the response is usually like, ‘That’s too good to be true. What really happened.’ And I go, ‘That’s actually what happened,” he continued. “That’s genuinely the full truth. We’re just excited. And part of my job is not to keep and to hoard and to try to build a little empire. My job is to see especially our staff step into the call of God on their life.\nHe added that, “God has asked them to take a step of faith—we’re backing it 100%.”’\nHillsong Church Global Senior Pastor Phil Dooley joined Lopez in the announcement.\nWhile Dooley acknowledged during the service that “we’ve faced some challenges as a church,” he focused on the “lasting impact” the San Francisco campus has made on the Hillsong brand.\n“We believe the time is right for this,” Dooley said. “This is an exciting season for the Browns and for our church in San Francisco, and we want to say how much we love Brenden and Jacqui, and we value their dedication, their sacrifice, and their commitment to pastoring and leading the Hillsong San Francisco community.”\nThe Browns have been members at Hillsong for 24 years and in leadership for the last seven, he noted.\nPastor Brenden Brown addresses Hillsong Church in San Francisco, California in 2019. (Photo via social media) To the Browns and the San Francisco church, Dooley said, “We love you, and we are committed to remaining in close relationship with you as we embark on this faithful journey together.”\nOn Instagram , the Browns posted a statement about their excitement for this news.\n“We’re stepping into a new season as a new church!” they wrote. “God has been faithful in every step of our journey, and we believe He’s leading us into something fresh and full of purpose. While our name is changing, our heart remains the same—to love people and connect them to Jesus.”\nThey thanked the global church family and leaders for their support and invited worshippers to return for “Vision Sunday” on Feb. 23 to “unpack the vision for what’s ahead!”\nHillsong’s History of Scandal Since the pandemic, Hillsong’s global church has faced numerous high-profile scandals, The Roys Report (TRR) previously reported. In 2020, Hillsong New York City Lead Pastor Carl Lentz was fired due to “moral issues,” including being unfaithful to his wife.\nThen in 2022, Brian and Bobbie Houston resigned as the global senior pastors of the church, TRR reported . An internal investigation revealed Brian had alleged sexual misconduct and acted inappropriately toward two women in 2019.\nHillsong Church Founders Brian and Bobbie Houston. (Photo via Facebook) He later complained that he was “betrayed,” “lied about,” and “defrauded.”\nHouston also made headlines in 2023 when an Australian court found Houston not guilty of concealing sex abuse by his father, Frank Houston, and not reporting it to the police, TRR previously reported .\nThat same year, Australian Member of Parliament Andrew Wilkie launched an investigation into the church’s spending. Wilkie told the Australian Parliament that the church had engaged in mass money laundering, tax evasion, and fraud, and used church money “to do the kind of shopping that would embarrass a Kardashian.”\nWilkie also alleged that Hillsong makes $80 million more annually than it reports. He also said that founder Brian Houston and other church leaders live luxuriously living large on the church’s money.\nThe Pentecostal powerhouse church still operates campuses in more than 30 countries, according to its website .\nLiz Lykins is a correspondent covering religion news for The Roys Report, WORLD Magazine, and other publications.",

Gross margin fell slightly at 42.5% compared with 44.4% in 2022.\nMeanwhile, distribution and administration costs increased slightly to £86.3m and the operating loss for the year was £16.8m, compared with £19.8m in 2022.\nFull-year figures for 2024 are not due to be filed until September of this year.\nLogin to continue reading.\nThis article is premium content.

    "text": "Football CAN : le Sénégal déjà en huitième de finale après sa victoire face au Cameroun Le Sénégal a battu le Cameroun (3-1) pour la première fois depuis 34 ans en Coupe d'Afrique des nations et s'est qualifié pour les 8e de finale, vendredi à Yamoussoukro. Le Sénégal a enfin battu le Cameroun (3-1) en Coupe d'Afrique, 34 ans après, pour se qualifier pour les 8e de finale, débarrassé de son vieux complexe face à son prestigieux adversaire, nettement dominé vendredi à Yamoussoukro. L'histoire a basculé. L'ouverture du score du Marseillais Ismaïla Sarr, qui a pu se retourner dans une défense apathique (16), symbolise ces courbes en train de se croiser entre les deux vieux rivaux. Au Sénégal le réalisme, au Cameroun le manque de hargne. A LIRE AUSSI >> [CAN-2024 : la Côte d'Ivoire s'incline, l'Egypte et le Ghana font match nul](/sport/2024/01/18/can-2024-la-cote-d-ivoire-s-incline-l-egypte-et-le-ghana-font-match-nul) Le tenant du titre assume toujours bien son rôle de favori: il rejoint en 8e de finale le Cap-Vert, qualifié un peu plus tôt en cartonnant le Mozambique (3-0) avec notamment un coup franc de 40 m de Bebé. Le Cameroun, tenu en échec par la Guinée (1-1) au premier match, est encore loin du deuxième tour et de son glorieux passé. A part un premier match de groupe gagné (2-0) en Algérie en 1990, les « Lions de la Teranga » avaient toujours fini en larmes face aux « Indomptables » du Cameroun. Battus chez eux à Dakar en quarts de finale en 1992 (1-0), en finale 2002 (0-0, 3-2 aux t.a.b.) et encore en quarts en 2017 (0-0, 5-4 aux t.a.b.), quand Sadio Mané avait raté son tir au but, les Sénégalais ont cette fois fait la loi, à l'image de leur capitaine Kalidou Koulibaly, solide comme un roc, vainqueur de nombreux duels avec les attaquants camerounais. Le Cameroun réagit trop tard A voir Lamine Camara demander à grands moulinets encore plus de bruits aux supporters sénégalais, on comprenait que le prometteur (20 ans) milieu de terrain, auteur d'un doublé au premier match contre la Gambie (3-0), vivait intensément la rivalité entre les deux Lions (16). Après les joutes verbales entre les sélectionneurs sénégalais Aliou Cissé et camerounais Rigobert Song, qui étaient tous les deux capitaines de la finale 2002, la plus belle affiche du premier tour n'a pas tenu ses promesses, faute de consistance des joueurs en vert. Franck Magri, replacé du côté droit à son vrai poste, avant-centre, n'a eu que des miettes. Et le gardien André Onana, autorisé à n'arriver que pour le second match, n'a rien pu faire. Le spectacle n'a été vraiment intense que vers la fin, dans un stade Konan-Banny plein, achevé de se remplir à la mi-temps par l'ouverture des portes aux spectateurs massés derrière les grilles. Après le 2-0 signé Habib Diallo, reprenant un centre de Sarr (71), les Camerounais ont enfin réagi avec un but de la tête de Jean-Charles Castelletto (83). Les Sénégalais ont alors testé leur « complexe camerounais »: ils n'allaient quand même pas se faire rejoindre par une équipe qu'ils avaient dominée ! Test réussi: après une ultime frayeur sur une tête de Georges-Kevin Nkoudou (90+4), Mané a marqué le but du 3-1 (90+5). Les Lions du Sénégal ne remâcheront plus leur vieille revanche, ils l'ont prise. La Guinée s'impose face à la Gambie Plus tard dans la soirée, La Guinée a battu la Gambie (1-0) et s'est approchée des 8e de finale de la Coupe d'Afrique, vendredi à Yamoussoukro. Grâce à un but d'Aguibou Camara (69e), le « Syli National » prend la deuxième place du groupe C avec 4 points, derrière le Sénégal (6 pts) et devant le Cameroun (1 pt), un total qui devrait lui assurer au pire sa qualification au tour suivant parmi les meilleurs troisièmes.",

    "text": "Discothèque de Saint-Domingue: vers la fin des opérations de secours sur un bilan d'au moins 124 morts\nLes équipes de secours, qui n'ont plus trouvé de survivant depuis mardi après-midi, prévoient la fin des opérations de recherche mercredi quand ils auront extrait 20 corps détectés dans les décombres de la discothèque dont le toit s'est effondré dans la nuit de lundi à mardi, provoquant la mort d'au moins 124 personnes.\nLe bilan devrait donc s'alourdir encore, sous réserve que ces corps n'avaient pas déjà été comptabilisés dans le bilan officiel réalisé régulièrement par le directeur du Centre d'opérations d'urgence (COE), Juan Manuel Mendez.\nEn attendant, des dizaines de proches s'agglutinent toujours autour de la discothèque, des hôpitaux et de la morgue en attendant des nouvelles ou l'identification de leurs proches.\nUn brandit une photo, un autre attend tête baissée. Une liste de noms de victimes a été placée sur la bâche d'une tente à côté de l'endroit où les corps arrivent.\nMercedes Lopez cherche l'un de ses fils porté disparu. \"On ne nous a donné aucune information, on ne l'a trouvé ni dans les listes (de morts) ni dans les hôpitaux\", raconte-t-elle à l'AFP. \"C'est de l'angoisse et beaucoup de douleur\", ajoute-t-elle.\n\"Nous avons l'espoir que Dieu le sortira de là vivant\", dit Larissa Minier, qui s'accroche à un infime espoir de retrouver son frère.\n- Trou béant -\n\"En ce moment, nous effectuons une extraction de 20 corps que nous avons visualisés. Nous en avons sorti 12. (...) Nous prévoyons de terminer les opérations de recherche aujourd'hui\", a affirmé le général José Luis Frometa Herasme, chef du Corps des Pompiers de Saint-Domingue.\nDes images aériennes montrent un trou béant à la place du toit de l'établissement et des pelles mécaniques pour dégager l'entrelacs de blocs de béton et de ferrailles.\nTrois cents secouristes travaillent depuis 36 heures, avec l'appui d'équipes venues d'Israël et de Porto Rico arrivées en renfort.\nM. Mendez a souligné lors du premier point dans la matinée que \"l'identification des corps\" était en cours et que l'Institut médico-légal de République dominicaine aller donner des indications sur la nationalité des victimes.\nAu moins un Américain figure parmi les victimes, a annoncé le chef de la diplomatie américaine Marco Rubio dans un communiqué dans lequel il dit que ses pensées vont \"aux familles et aux proches touchés par cet événement dévastateur (...) qui a entraîné la mort malheureuse d'au moins un citoyen américain et de résidents permanents légaux américains\".\nM. Mendez a également indiqué que \"le nombre de 155 transferts (vers les hôpitaux) reste inchangé depuis mardi après-midi\", ce qui signifie que les sauveteurs n'ont sorti que des corps des décombres depuis mardi soir.\nLes autorités ont appelé la population à faire des dons de sang.\nIl s'agit de l'une des pires catastrophes de l'histoire récente du pays, marquée par une explosion à San Cristobal, dans la périphérie de Saint-Domingue (38 morts) il y a deux ans et, en 2005, par l'incendie d'une prison à Higuey (est) qui avait coûté la vie à 136 détenus.\nLes médias estiment qu'entre 500 et mille personnes se trouvaient au Jet Set, établissement prisé des noctambules et fréquenté par des célébrités. Les autorités n'ont pas communiqué le nombre de disparus.\n- Mort sur scène -\nDans une vidéo diffusée sur les réseaux sociaux, on peut voir le toit s'effondrer pendant que le chanteur Rubby Pérez est sur scène.\nSon corps a été exhumé des décombres dans la nuit, ont confirmé les autorités.\nLa musique de celui qui était surnommé \"la voix la plus aiguë du merengue\", a fait le tour de l'Amérique latine et caribéenne et de la planète.\nDe nombreux artistes lui ont rendu hommage sur les réseaux sociaux. \"L'ami et l'idole de notre genre vient de nous quitter\", a regretté un autre mythe de ce rythme dansant, Wilfrido Vargas.\nIl doit être enterré jeudi après un hommage au théâtre national.\nLe président dominicain Luis Abinader s'est rendu sur place dans la matinée de mardi et a décrété trois jours de deuil national en hommage aux victimes de la tragédie.",

    "title": "Christmas trees provide important fish habitat in Montana",
    "text": "HELENA — At Canyon Ferry Lake right now, you might be able to make out a bunch of black dots on the surface of the water. Those are lines of Christmas trees strung together with steel cables with cinder blocks attached. Eventually, those lines of Christmas trees will sink to the bottom and become habitat for perch. Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation employees like Jacob Stephens wait near the trees for DNRC helicopters to dip low enough over the Silos Campground area just north of Townsend to attach the line to the bottom of the helicopter as part of the Pines for Perch initiative. “So, we call this a hover hookup. And basically, you’re standing there letting the helicopter come to you, and hooking it directly to the hook underneath. And then, you’ve got a guy marshaling, using hand signals to call in the helicopter... So, this is a good experience for people that haven’t done it before because you get multiple repetitions. So, it lets them be familiar and comfortable under the helicopter,” says Stephens. Over the next few hours to days, these trees will take on water weight and sink about 15 feet to the bottom of the lake where they will be used by perch for spawning habitat. FWP has been doing this annually since 1999 due to declining perch levels, a fish that not only satisfies anglers but predator fish, as well. “Perch are unique. Not only are they one of the principal game species on Canyon Ferry Reservoir, they’re also one of the principal forage species. And so, for walleye to exist, we need to have a robust population of perch. And, of course, the anglers like to come out and catch perch and keep them themselves too. So, you got man versus predator fish out there, both of them have taken their turn at consuming perch,” says Senior Fisheries Technician with MT FWP, Troy Humphrey. Wade Hendricks, Area Aviation Officer for MT DNRC, has noticed a significant dip in donated trees in the last few years, including hundreds fewer trees donated this year when compared to last year. With Christmas coming around only once a year, Hendricks encourages folks to think about the way their trees can support an important species. “You know, when people are getting rid of their Christmas trees at the end of the holiday season maybe just think about taking them to the transfer station in Helena or the Boy Scouts will do curbside pickup for the used Christmas trees as well,” says Hendricks.",

Most of the strikes have targeted homes where Hezbollah had stored munitions, according to the IDF.\nOver 250 fighter jets have participated in the strikes, dropping some 2,000 munitions, the military adds.\nThe IDF says it will continue to strike Hezbollah to destroy its capabilities and “change the security reality in the north.”\nIsrael’s top army commander tells troops: “Your entry will show Hezbollah what it’s like to meet a professional combat force,” as he touts a “possible” ground invasion of southern Lebanon.\nIsrael calls up two additional reserve brigades to the northern border as it continues its massive bombing campaign across Lebanon, killing hundreds of people and displacing more than 90,000.\nHezbollah says it fired a ballistic missile targeting Mossad’s headquarters near Tel Aviv.\nForeign ministers of Egypt, Iraq and Jordan condemn Israel’s “aggression” against Lebanon, warning it’s “pushing the region towards all-out war”.",
