    "title": "Pam Ayres: ‘I wouldn’t be where I am today without the RAF – it changed my life’",
    "text": "For Pam Ayres, the RAF Benevolent Fund is something personal. Very personal.\n“I owe a huge debt to the RAF,” she says. “It opened my eyes to the world, it gave me the chance to perform. You could say I wouldn’t be where I am today without the RAF. It changed my life.”\nAnd Ayres is not exaggerating when she says her time in the service was pivotal. For more than 50 years she has been one of the country’s favourite performers , her observational poetry and songs invariably raising chortles and warming cockles. Still performing live, still producing volumes of delightful verse, still campaigning on wildlife issues, she reckons none of it would have happened without the RAF.\n“I was brought up very rural,” she recalls. “In our village [Stanford in the Vale in south Oxfordshire] there was only one bloke, called Johnny Moss, who had a car. Everybody else had a bike. You couldn’t go far. It was such a narrow view of life. Four of my brothers did National Service, went off on interesting experiences in faraway places. Me? I left school with very few qualifications, got a job as a civil servant filling in forms and hated it. I wanted to see the world. So I thought: right, I’ll do the same as my brothers.”\nThus it was that in 1965, aged 18, she joined the Women’s RAF. Not that she became a female Tom Cruise, flying supersonic Top Gun raids across the continent. Her experience was rather more prosaic: she was a Plotter Air Photographer, working on operational maps.\n“When I went to sign up in Reading, I told the sergeant there I like drawing,” she remembers. “He said, ‘Oh well, we’ll put you in the drawing office’. Which was not what I had in mind. I was dismayed at first – I found the work really difficult. There was a lot of maths, focal lengths, formula: that sort of thing. I just wasn’t good at it. Actually, I was pretty rubbish.”\nPam Ayres in her RAF days But if the work was challenging, the service offered the young Pam one sizable compensation.\n“The wonderful thing about the RAF then were the sports clubs, the swimming clubs, the education opportunities. And the theatre clubs.”\nIt was when she got a posting in Singapore that she discovered a talent that was to become the making of her. “There was a marvellous theatre on the base there, really well-equipped, and on a Friday night there’d be a club night, people singing or doing shows. It’s a bit grand to call it a cabaret, but I did a few funny parts and found people were laughing.”\nAnd the fact she was able to make people laugh, she says, was the most “wonderful discovery” of her life. “It was a thrilling thing. That great gust of laughter is really addictive.”\nBy now hooked, keen to perform as often as she could, there was just one issue. Quite a significant one at that.\n“I couldn’t find anything others had written that suited my accent,” she says, her South Oxfordshire burr as gloriously vibrant as ever as she chats on the phone from her home in Cirencester, where she is in the midst of what she describes as “a right stinker of a cold”.\nSo, needing her own material to make her fellow servicemen and women laugh, she started to write the witty verse that became her trademark.\n“When I found people were falling about at that, it gave me such a boost of confidence,” she recalls. “I’d write all the time. And I found I could learn lines really quickly. I’ve never liked to read my verse from a book. I want to look the audience in the eye.”\nThe trouble was, after completing three years in the service, stripped of the opportunities for such glorious self-expression, she initially struggled back on civvy street.\n“I did a succession of crummy jobs,” she recalls. “I couldn’t replace the facilities the RAF offered. I felt completely lost. So much so, I applied to go back in. I tried to be an air quartermaster, but I didn’t get through the course and was given the thumbs down. I was heartbroken.”\nWhich is why she is now such a supporter of the RAF Benevolent Fund.\n“I can understand completely how people feel leaving the service,” she says. “I understand how they sometimes get into difficulties. It’s because if you spend a long time in it, you get used to the framework, know how it all works, the common interests and aims. All that support and facilities fall away when you leave. By comparison the outside world can feel a bit draughty.”\nWhen one of Pam's poems was selected for Radio 4’s Pick of the Week, a much wider audience was given access to her work Credit : CLARA MOLDEN The RAFBF, she adds, is there to help those in need of a bit of insulation.\n“If your relationship has broken up, if you’ve been chucked out of your house, fallen on hard times, the fund is there for you,” she says. “There are so many ways it helps people who have been in the RAF. In a way, it has the same feel of the big family that you get while in the service. I approve of the feel of a big family. It’s always there for you if you need it.”\nNot that the young Pam needed it. Despite being forlorn at not being able to get back in the RAF, despite working in a succession of dead end jobs, she kept writing. And the good news was, by the early 1970s, in the west Oxfordshire town of Witney where she was then based, there was a burgeoning folk scene. She would perform in local pubs and clubs as often as she could.\n“One night I was on stage declaiming a poem about how I wish I’d looked after my teeth and BBC Radio Oxford [the then newly established local radio station] was in there recording for a folk programme. They heard me and invited me into the studio. I did a show and they offered me a weekly spot.”\nWhen one of her poems was selected for Radio 4’s Pick of the Week, and subsequently Pick of the Year, a much wider audience was given access to her work. Funny, poignant, wry, it was work that proved an instant nationwide hit.\n“Like most poets, I’d dismally failed to interest any publishers,” she says. “So I took my work to Church Army Press in Witney and amazingly nobody showed me the door. We did a book and when people heard my stuff on Pick of the Week, the manager of WH Smith kept coming to my flat to get more copies. I was getting deluged with fan letters from Canada, which was very odd. We sold 7,000 copies and I was away.”\nAnd, as she took off, becoming a fixture on television, radio and in the bestseller lists, she never forgot what had first given her impetus: the RAF.\n“I don’t think I’ve shouted enough about the RAFBF,” she says. “But I should do, because it’s a wonderful, wonderful thing.”\nThe RAF Benevolent Fund is one of four charities supported by this year’s Telegraph Christmas Charity Appeal .

    "title": "雷诺\"转型推手\"CEO德梅奥即将离任 电动化战略接力成新CEO挑战|Renault_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "中经记者 尹丽梅 张硕 北京报道\n法国汽车制造商雷诺汽车公司（以下简称“雷诺”）迎来新一轮高管调整。近日，雷诺宣布公司CEO卢卡·德梅奥（Luca de Meo）将于7月中旬卸任。\n受德梅奥即将卸任CEO这一消息影响，雷诺股价在次日下跌逾8%。\n对于资本市场的这种反应，汽车新四化产业研究者、北京知行韬略管理咨询有限公司合伙人杨继刚告诉《中国经营报》记者，股价下跌反映的是资本市场对继任者是否能维持变革节奏的不确定性感到担忧。这种不确定性包括：电动车板块Ampere上市推进问题、电动平台的战略部署问题、软件生态整合等问题，这些都需要接班人有很强的执行力和对产业趋势的敏锐判断。\n“功成身退”\n德梅奥在汽车行业有着超过25年的从业经验，履历遍及丰田欧洲、大众和奥迪等多家主流车企。2020年，当雷诺正处于严重亏损、经营困境之际，他从大众集团转投雷诺，接下CEO一职，那一年雷诺深陷80.5亿欧元（约合人民币666亿元）的创纪录年度亏损中。\n走马上任后，德梅奥果断启动结构性改革。他主导制定了“Renaulution”战略，以成本削减、产品精简和电动化转型等为核心，分阶段推进公司转型。在他的主导下，雷诺通过削减全球工厂产能、裁员、缩减人力成本、优化供应链等手段，大幅降低运营开支，并逐步摆脱臃肿低效的组织架构。\n在经营上，德梅奥改变过去雷诺关注营收和市场份额目标的做法，转而聚焦提升公司营业利润率、现金流和投资回报等。这使得雷诺的战略变得更为聚焦。\n在产品层面，德梅奥以利润导向，砍掉12款盈利能力较弱的车型，同时加速电动化布局。他推动雷诺重启经典车型雷诺5的电动版开发，并通过压缩研发周期、本土制造等方式，迅速推出更适应欧洲市场的具有性价比的电动车型。\n雷诺的电动化举措落地已然见效。财报数据显示，2025年一季度，雷诺集团在欧洲的电动化车型销量占比为44.2%，同比增长15.3%。其中混合动力车型占比31.0%，纯电动车占比13.2%。同期，雷诺品牌在欧洲的电动化车型销量占比达到61.2%，同比上升15%，环比增长6.6%。\n在“Renaulution”战略的指引下，德梅奥对高端子品牌Alpine也进行了战略上的升级。他将这一原本定位为小众跑车的品牌，扩展为涵盖多元化电动产品线的纯电动汽车品牌。\n在国际市场，德梅奥推动雷诺退出中国乘用车市场，将资源聚焦在欧洲、拉丁美洲、中东等利润率更高的市场；同时，通过与吉利、 宁德时代 等中国企业合作整合供应链，在上海设立研发中心，服务欧洲电动车项目，体现出其“去全球化背景下的再本土化”战略思维。\n在精简组织的同时，雷诺也在向更具灵活性与盈利能力的方向演进。过去五年，雷诺虽然在体量上有所收缩，但整体运营效率显著提升。\n财务数据显示，2024财年，雷诺实现营收同比增长7.4%，净利润增长21%。截至2024年12月31日，雷诺汽车业务净现金财务状况创纪录，达到71亿欧元（约合人民币587.86亿元），较2023年12月31日增长34亿欧元（约合人民币281.5亿元），几乎翻倍。2025财年第一季度，雷诺全球销量同比增长2.9%，达56.5万辆。在全球汽车产业普遍承压的背景下，这一成绩尤为引人注目。\n“雷诺集团在运营表现上持续提升，通过既定战略成功达成预期目标。2024年是前所未有的一年，我们发起的产品攻势开始显现积极成效。这一业绩是公司深度转型的结果，得益于卓越的团队协作，雷诺集团已转型为一家更灵活、高效且具有竞争力的公司。”今年2月下旬，德梅奥在2024年业绩说明会上表示，基于过去四年积累的坚实基础，在敏捷和创新的思维指导下，雷诺正在积极筹备下一阶段的发展，致力于在实现盈利增长的同时为集团的长远未来投资。\n仍有难题待解\n在重塑企业新发展路径的同时，德梅奥也在积极为雷诺构建未来增长的第二曲线。\n在“Renaulution”战略框架下，雷诺当前正在进行进一步的深化转型，核心是推动电动化与软件能力的深度整合。其中最受关注的是德梅奥想将雷诺电动汽车部门Ampere从雷诺集团拆分出来，并计划将其独立上市，以激活外部资本对公司新业务的估值重构。不过，这一系列新战略仍处于推进关键期。\n“德梅奥在任期内是做出了一些成绩的，资本市场对德梅奥的表现也很认可。他推出的Revolution战略计划，将雷诺带入了下一个发展阶段，并正在推动电动车业务的独立上市。”浅觉深知咨询创始人、罗兰贝格咨询前项目经理陆盛赟在采访中告诉记者，在雷诺宣布德梅奥即将卸任的消息后，雷诺股价下跌，反映出市场对下一任CEO能否延续当前改革成效存在疑虑。\n“德梅奥在任五年，是雷诺实施转型的灵魂人物，他推动了雷诺品牌的复兴、电动汽车业务Ampere的独立，并重构了雷诺与日产的联盟关系。”杨继刚亦认为，对于雷诺的下一任CEO而言，其面临的不仅是管理方面的问题，如何在战略转型方面保持连贯性也是一场大考。\n据悉，德梅奥将空降奢侈品巨头开云集团，接替弗朗索瓦·皮诺特出任CEO。开云集团是一家法国奢侈品集团，旗下拥有伊夫·圣罗兰、古驰和巴黎世家等知名品牌。\n“人生中总有功成身退的时候。在雷诺集团，创历史纪录的业绩便是最佳证明。我们拥有强大的团队与敏捷的组织架构，更制定了面向下一代产品的战略蓝图。因此我决定在此刻交棒。离任之际，雷诺已成为面向未来完成转型的企业。”德梅奥在辞职信中写下的这段话，既是对自身既往成绩的肯定，亦寄托了他对雷诺未来的期许。\n目前，雷诺还未公布新的CEO人选。业内分析人士指出，当前全球汽车行业面临诸多挑战，这些挑战包括向电动汽车转型的不确定性、贸易紧张局势升级以及中国汽车制造商日益激烈的竞争，德梅奥的离职对雷诺而言不是一个好消息。\n与此同时，上述业内分析人士认为，目前雷诺仍然面临着行业价格竞争加剧、欧洲需求放缓以及电动汽车转型成本高昂等方面的压力。“虽然雷诺在电动车转型上起步较早，但当前行业已进入第二阶段竞争，涉及技术平台、成本控制、智能化体验等维度，而雷诺在这方面仍面临挑战。”\n（编辑：张硕 审核：童海华 校对：翟军）",

    "text": "Исследование женских слитных купальников 21 популярной торговой марки показало, что только три производителя полностью соответствуют всем нормативным требованиям.\nЭксперты Роскачества проверили продукцию по 53 параметрам безопасности, качества и достоверности маркировки, обнаружив нарушения у 18 брендов. Результаты исследования приводит РИА «Новости».\nНаиболее серьезные нарушения, касающиеся обязательных требований технического регламента Таможенного союза, выявлены у девяти производителей. К ним относятся недостаточная воздухопроницаемость (Women'Secret, Befree, Termit, «Черемушки»), низкая устойчивость окраски к поту (Reebok) и морской воде (Edge Planet), а также проблемы с маркировкой (Bonafide, Tribuna, Emdi и Edge Planet).\nЕще девять брендов, хотя и соответствуют минимальным обязательным требованиям, не дотягивают до более строгих стандартов Роскачества. Среди основных недостатков – низкая прочность ткани и швов (Tezenis), недостаточная стойкость к истиранию и слабая эластичность (Calzedonia, Puma, Belle You, Adidas, Joss), а также плохая устойчивость окраски к ультрафиолету (Termit).\nВажно подчеркнуть, что несоответствие опережающим стандартам Роскачества не является нарушением законодательства, но лишает производителей возможности получить знак качества. Эти повышенные требования касаются таких характеристик, как износостойкость, прочность и комфортность изделий.\nНа данный момент Роспотребнадзор уже направил предостережения нарушителям обязательных норм и приостановил действие сертификатов соответствия для части продукции. Некоторые компании уже отреагировали на результаты тестов, пообещав провести внутренние проверки и ликвидировать выявленные недостатки. Потребителям же эксперты рекомендуют обращать особое внимание на маркировку изделий и их состав при покупке купальников.",

    "text": "When I started covering the Lions in 2014, I talked a lot about Ndamukong Suh. It was hard not to. He was in the final year of his contract and everyone wanted to know what his next move was going to be. Eventually that move was to leave the Lions and head to Miami. I thought I was done talking about him. Then 2023 rolled around. Here I am talking about him again for the fourth time this season. This time it's pretty fun because it's not about whether or not he's going to sign with the Lions this year. That question has been answered for sure. This time it's to remember the first playoff game I ever covered. You might remember that one. It actually might be one you try to forget. The Lions lost after a controversial picked up flag wiped out a pass interference call that would have allowed the Lions to potentially widen the gap on the scoreboard. Suh is still upset about that. He took some shots at the Cowboys on Instagram on Thursday. You might remember, again I know you're trying not to, that Suh was pretty distraught after that loss. He openly wept out of frustration in front of the media and you really can't blame him. I'm sure a lot of people wept that night. In this moment I do kind of wish he could play in this game. It's about time for some revenge.",

    "text": "How Much Does it Cost to Declaw a Cat?\nDeclawing a cat is a surgical procedure that removes the cat’s claws, also known as onychectomy. While it may seem like a simple solution to prevent scratching damage or other issues, it’s essential to consider the costs involved before making a decision. In this article, we’ll delve into the details of how much it costs to declaw a cat and what you can expect during the process.\nThe Cost of Declawing a Cat\nThe cost of declawing a cat varies depending on several factors, including the location, veterinarian, and type of procedure. Here are some estimated costs:\nTraditional Declawing : The most common method of declawing involves surgically removing the claws. The cost of traditional declawing ranges from: $50 to $100 per paw (total of $100 to $200 for a single procedure)\n$150 to $300 per paw (total of $300 to $600 for a single procedure) for high-end veterinary clinics or in areas with a high cost of living\nLaser Declawing : A newer method of declawing uses a laser to remove the claw. The cost of laser declawing is typically higher than traditional declawing: $200 to $500 per paw (total of $400 to $1,000 for a single procedure)\n$500 to $1,000 per paw (total of $1,000 to $2,000 for a single procedure) for high-end veterinary clinics or in areas with a high cost of living\nBoth Paws Declawing : Declawing both paws is often recommended to prevent scratching and other issues. The total cost for both paws can range from: $200 to $1,000 (traditional) or $400 to $2,000 (laser)\nFactors Affecting the Cost\nSeveral factors can influence the cost of declawing a cat, including:\nVeterinarian’s Fees : The veterinarian’s fees can vary depending on their experience, location, and the complexity of the procedure.\nAnesthesia Costs : The cost of anesthesia can range from $50 to $200, depending on the type and duration of anesthesia.\nSurgical Supplies : The cost of surgical supplies, such as gloves, sutures, and antibiotics, can range from $50 to $100.\nLocation : The cost of declawing a cat can vary depending on the location. Urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas.\nType of Procedure : The type of procedure used, such as traditional or laser declawing, can also affect the cost.\nPost-Operative Care and Complications\nAfter the declawing procedure, your cat will require post-operative care to ensure a smooth recovery. This may include:\nPain Management : Your veterinarian may prescribe pain medication to manage your cat’s discomfort.\nMonitor for Complications : You’ll need to monitor your cat’s wound for signs of infection, swelling, or bleeding.\nRestrict Activity : Your veterinarian may recommend restricting your cat’s activity to prevent injury or further complications.\nCommon complications that can arise after declawing include:\nInfection : Bacterial or fungal infections can occur at the surgical site.\nSwelling : Swelling or inflammation at the surgical site can occur.\nBleeding : Bleeding or hemorrhage at the surgical site can occur.\nNerve Damage : Damage to the nerves surrounding the paw can occur, leading to numbness, tingling, or pain.\nAlternatives to Declawing\nBefore committing to declawing, it’s essential to consider alternative solutions to prevent scratching damage or other issues. Some options include:\nNail Trimming : Regular nail trimming can help prevent scratching damage.\nScratching Posts : Providing scratching posts or pads can redirect your cat’s scratching behavior.\nBehavioral Training : Working with a professional animal trainer can help address behavioral issues.\nConclusion\nDeclawing a cat is a significant decision that requires careful consideration. While the cost of declawing can range from $200 to $2,000, depending on the location and type of procedure, it’s essential to weigh the benefits against the potential risks and complications. By considering alternative solutions and consulting with a veterinarian, you can make an informed decision about the best course of action for your feline friend.\nTable: Estimated Costs of Declawing a Cat\nType of Declawing\nCost per Paw\nTotal Cost for Both Paws\nTraditional\n$50-$100\n$200-$400\nTraditional (high-end)\n$150-$300\n$300-$600\nLaser\n$200-$500\n$400-$1,000\nLaser (high-end)\n$500-$1,000\n$1,000-$2,000\nTable: Factors Affecting the Cost of Declawing a Cat\nFactor\nEstimated Cost\nVeterinarian’s Fees\n$50-$200\nAnesthesia Costs\n$50-$200\nSurgical Supplies\n$50-$100\nLocation\n$100-$500\nType of Procedure\n$100-$1,000\nRemember, every cat is unique, and the cost of declawing may vary depending on your specific situation. Consult with a veterinarian to determine the best course of action for your feline friend.",

    "text": "(HealthDay News) — A higher self-reported frequency of adding salt to foods is associated with a higher risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population, according to a study published online Dec. 28 in JAMA Network Open .\nRui Tang, MPH, from Tulane University in New Orleans, and colleagues examined the association of self-reported frequency of adding salt to food with incident CKD risk in a general population of adults aged 37 to 73 years from the UK Biobank who were free of CKD at baseline.\nThe researchers found that 22,031 incident events of CKD were documented during a median follow-up of 11.8 years within a cohort of 465,288 individuals. After adjustment for covariates, higher self-reported frequency of adding salt to foods was significantly associated with a higher CKD risk. Those who reported sometimes, usually and always adding salt to food had an increased risk for CKD compared with those who reported never or rarely adding salt to foods (adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals], 1.04 [1.00 to 1.07], 1.07 [1.02 to 1.11] and 1.11 [1.05 to 1.18], respectively). The associations were significantly modified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index (BMI) and physical activity, with more pronounced associations seen for those with a higher eGFR, lower BMI and lower level of physical activity.\n“These findings support the reduction of adding salt to foods as a potential intervention strategy for CKD prevention,” the authors write.\nAbstract/Full Text\nMore from McKnight's Senior Living",

    "text": "Venezuela reduce la jornada laboral a solo 3 días con 13.5 horas semanales tras enfrentar una crisis energética\nEl gobierno de Venezuela redujo la jornada laboral del sector público a tres días por semana como medida para enfrentar la crisis energética\nEl gobierno de Nicolás Maduro anunció una drástica reducción en la jornada laboral del sector público como parte de las medidas para enfrentar la crisis energética que atraviesa el país. Esta decisión surge ante la incapacidad del sistema eléctrico para operar a plena capacidad, lo que ha provocado constantes fallas en el suministro de energía.\nDe acuerdo con Óscar Murillo, director de la ONG Provea, Venezuela actualmente solo genera el 20 % de la electricidad que necesita, lo que obliga a racionar el consumo. A pesar de las inversiones en plantas eléctricas, la corrupción y la mala gestión han impedido que los recursos fluyan correctamente para mejorar el servicio.\nTe podría interesar: Nicolás Maduro responde a Donald Trump sobre imposición de aranceles al petróleo venezolano\n¿En qué consiste la nueva jornada laboral?\nLa medida afecta exclusivamente al sector público, que ahora trabajará solo tres días a la semana, con horarios reducidos. Las jornadas serán de lunes a viernes, de 8:00 a 12:30 horas, es decir, solo cuatro horas y media diarias. Esto representa un recorte significativo, pues los empleados pasarán de laborar 40 horas semanales a apenas 13.5 horas.\nPor otro lado, el sector educativo ya había sido sujeto a restricciones previas, con clases únicamente tres días a la semana. Los docentes, además de enfrentarse a la crisis energética, perciben sueldos bajos, de alrededor de 40 dólares mensuales (aproximadamente 800 pesos mexicanos), lo que ha llevado a que el 70% haya renunciado o buscado empleo en el sector privado.\n¿Cómo afecta esta medida a la población?\nLa reducción de la jornada laboral impacta directamente la productividad del sector público, lo que podría agravar la crisis económica del país. Además, la disminución en la cantidad de horas trabajadas podría reflejarse en una reducción salarial, lo que afectaría aún más el poder adquisitivo de los empleados públicos.\nEn las redes sociales, la población ha expresado su descontento por la situación, denunciando la falta de servicios básicos y la incapacidad del gobierno para resolver la crisis. La reducción del horario laboral es vista por muchos como un reflejo de la grave situación económica y energética que enfrenta Venezuela.\n¿Qué antecedentes tiene la crisis energética en Venezuela?\nLa crisis eléctrica en Venezuela no es nueva. Hace una década, el país ya había enfrentado problemas similares, que se agudizaron durante la pandemia de 2020. En ese periodo, el gobierno también implementó racionamientos de electricidad y restricciones laborales.\nA pesar de las inversiones extranjeras en plantas eléctricas, la corrupción y la falta de mantenimiento han impedido que el sistema funcione de manera adecuada. La crisis actual ha llevado a que las autoridades apliquen medidas extremas, como la reducción laboral, para intentar estabilizar el consumo energético.\nTe podría interesar: Venezolanos, rechazan con marcha, el “secuestro” de migrantes en El Salvador\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.
