    "text": "Après un gain de près de 0,2% vers 7394 pour démarrer 2025, le CAC40 débute la séance en baisse à l'ouverture vers 7340 (-0,7%), les investisseurs continuant de s'interroger sur les perspectives pour l'année qui commence.\n'Alors que nous attendons avec impatience l'année à venir, il convient de se rappeler qu'aucune des cinq dernières années ne s'est exactement déroulée comme prévu dans la sphère macroéconomique', prévient Deutsche Bank.\nPour l'heure, la banque allemande met en avant les évènements politiques majeurs prévus pour le premier trimestre, à savoir l'arrivée de Donald Trump à la Maison Blanche le 20 janvier, ainsi que les élections législatives prévues en Allemagne le 23 février.\n'Les banques centrales devraient rester sous les feux de la rampe en 2025', estime-t-elle en outre, notant que si la Fed et la BCE ont signalé que d'autres baisses de taux sont à venir, l'inflation reste légèrement supérieure à leurs objectifs.\n'Il sera donc intéressant de voir si nous obtiendrons les baisses de taux supplémentaires que les marchés anticipent, ou si ce sera une autre année (comme pour les trois dernières) où les attentes du marché s'avéreront trop accommodantes', conclut Deutsche Bank.\nPrincipale donnée de la séance, l'indice ISM manufacturier des Etats-Unis -à paraitre en milieu d'après-midi- viendra corroborer ou au contraire contredire l'indice PMI de la veille, annoncé en léger repli à 49,4 pour le mois de décembre.\nDans l'actualité des valeurs, EssilorLuxottica fait part de l'acquisition de Pulse Audition, startup proposant des solutions de réduction du bruit et de rehaussement de la voix basés sur des algorithmes intégrant l'IA, destinées aux personnes malentendantes.\nLe réassureur Scor annonce la finalisation de la cession de sa participation au capital de Humensis, neuvième groupe d'édition généraliste et scolaire en France, à Huyghens de Participations, holding du groupe Albin Michel.\nCopyright (c) 2025 CercleFinance.com.

    "text": "‘Fallout’ is a brutal, sci-fi stunner post-apocalyptic show\nPrime Video’s latest offering, “Fallout,” is set to stun the audience who want their series to be gruesome and naturally clever. Adapted from the video game of the same name, “Fallout” gives an action-packed, gory production that a post-apocalyptic story demands. The killer performances from the cast members add a comic value to this narrative to appeal to the viewers’ tastes.\nBeginning its first episode with a “The End” title card given an inescapable nuclear apocalypse, the series jumps 219 years later to show an underground vault where survivors reside, hoping to have the chance to return to the surface and restore civilization one day.\nTelling the story of essentially different characters whose paths will eventually cross, “Fallout” primarily follows Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), a young vault dweller whose life is turned upside down after “invaders” raid the only place she’s called home, forcing her to leave the safety of the vault and venture into the surface for the very first time in her whole existence.\nREAD: ‘Dune Part Two’ rolls into London for world premiere\nRemaining true to its source material yet still expanding the idea and tone of the video game, “Fallout” captures the solid world-building that is accurately placed for the audience’s intrigue. The choice of music contributes to the suspense and beauty of this post-apocalyptic drama that even non-video game fans can appreciate.\nIn a world that slowly succumbs to the dangers of climate change and technology, apocalyptic narratives give a reflective view on the fate of humanity, which exists between an idealized, perfect world and an all-too-real, damaged one.\nWith its astonishing special effects and effortless humor, “Fallout” gives the viewers something to ponder and enjoy in a dangerous, toxic, and politically deranged world. The twists and standout scenes will set up the audience to plead for an immediate second season.\nAll eight episodes of “Fallout” are currently streaming on Prime Video.",

    "text": "India is filled with hidden gems that are just waiting to be explored. For travellers, who wish to experience unique weather conditions, the country has something special to offer. While India is often known for its scorching October heat, Northern India, in particular, has some of the coldest destinations in the country, where temperatures can be bone-chilling. If you are looking to enjoy snow-covered landscapes, cozy cottages and thrilling winter sports, here is a list of the best places to visit that will give you a taste of winter.\\nSpiti Valley\\nIn October, the temperatures at night in this Himachal Pradesh region often dip below zero. But during the day, the warmth of sunshine mixed with chilly air feels lovely. While in Spiti, one should not miss exploring the historic monasteries, along with other beautiful sights.\\nGulmarg\\nThe region located in Jammu & Kashmir, is currently facing freezing temperatures, but in the coming months, it will transform into a snowy paradise. Last year, snowfall was delayed, leaving many tourists disappointed. But people who visited in late January had unforgettable experiences. If you want to witness Kashmir’s winter charm without the crowds, now is the perfect time to make your reservations.\\nLadakh\\nIn Ladakh, the temperatures start to drop from October. It is common to experience such freezing conditions, especially at night. But don’t let the chilly weather discourage you from exploring this beautiful region. During the day, places like Leh, Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake become paradise under the bright sun.\\nKeylong\\nLocated in the Lahaul and Spiti districts, Keylong is one of the least explored winter spots and a true hidden gem for those who love cold weather. In October, temperatures often go below and the nights can be extremely cold. Keylong offers a peaceful atmosphere for those looking to escape the usual tourist spots and enjoy winters in isolation.\\nChitkul\\nAnother winter paradise of Himachal Pradesh, which typically experiences freezing temperatures at night. As the year comes to an end, Chitkul will be covered with snow, due to which, entering the region will not be possible. If you want to experience this unique place, book your tickets now.",

The Final Four signage everywhere, the banners hanging from the rafters listing every previous National Championships.\nShe found Dawn Staley, Lisa Boyer and Jolette Law , embraced all three and went to work at South Carolina’s practice the day before taking on North Carolina State in the Final Four.\nThis occasion is not new for her, but the moment is.\n“It’s just something that I always do,” Feagin told GamecockScoop. “I just tell them good morning, ask how their morning is going, how they slept, stuff like that.”\nContent Loading Embed content not available\nManage privacy settings PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nc3RfX2NvbnRlbnQtYmxvY2sgc3RfX2NvbnRlbnQtYmxv Y2stLXR3ZWV0Jz4KPGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY2VudGVyX3R3ZWV0Jz48YmxvY2tx dW90ZSBjbGFzcz0idHdpdHRlci10d2VldCI+PHAgbGFuZz0iZW4iIGRpcj0i bHRyIj5HYW1lY29ja3MgYXJlIG9uIHRoZSBmbG9vciBpbiBDbGV2ZWxhbmQu IDxicj48YnI+QmlnIGVtYnJhY2UgYmV0d2VlbiBTYW5pYSBGZWFnaW4gYW5k IHRoZSBjb2FjaGluZyBzdGFmZi4gPGEgaHJlZj0iaHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvL0pV alFKZEFFNDciPnBpYy50d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9KVWpRSmRBRTQ3PC9hPjwvcD4m bWRhc2g7IEFsYW4gQ29sZSAoQEFsYW5fX0NvbGUpIDxhIGhyZWY9Imh0dHBz Oi8vdHdpdHRlci5jb20vQWxhbl9fQ29sZS9zdGF0dXMvMTc3NTg3MjAxMDM0 MzU2NzY4MT9yZWZfc3JjPXR3c3JjJTVFdGZ3Ij5BcHJpbCA0LCAyMDI0PC9h PjwvYmxvY2txdW90ZT4KPHNjcmlwdCBhc3luYyBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxh dGZvcm0udHdpdHRlci5jb20vd2lkZ2V0cy5qcyIgY2hhcnNldD0idXRmLTgi Pjwvc2NyaXB0PgoKPC9kaXY+CjwvZGl2PgoK Of the half dozen Gamecocks who were on the roster in last season’s Final Four loss to Iowa, only Raven Johnson and Kamilla Cardoso saw significant action. Bree Hall played seven minutes against the Hawkeyes and 14 minutes across two games in the 2022 Final Four, enough experience to say she moved the needle both years.\nThose other three — Feagin, Ashlyn Watkins, Chloe Kitts — watched from the bench as the Gamecocks dropped a 77-73 heartbreaker in Dallas. They were there and remember how it felt, but could not do anything to change it. This Final Four is about all 10 of these Gamecocks and their final steps avenging last year’s loss, but three share a specific experience.\nThey have been part of a Final Four, but never had a chance to stamp an impact on one.\n“I'm excited for them,” Staley said. “I'm excited for their opportunity because they did sit a long time last year and now when they're given the opportunity or earned the opportunity to play, they are certainly showcasing their talents, and they put us in a position of being here at the Final Four. I'm excited for them and their families.”\nFeagin has played in a Final Four in the very literal sense; she got one late minute in the blowout 2022 National Championship Game just to get her name on the books for the victory.\nHer minutes have more than doubled since last season and quadrupled since her freshman year, becoming a rotation mainstay. Defense, long the only thing holding her back from truly launching into orbit, has significantly improved this season. The offensive aggression and prowess was there from day one on campus. Those forceful post moves, the shoulder drop off the dribble, the controlled finishing through contact.\nAll of those attributes of her craft she has tirelessly worked to perfect and subsequently earn more playing time, now on the grandest platform in college basketball.\n“It’s a little different,” Feagin said. “Only because we’re actually able to be a part of it and impact the game.”\nStaley has split starting duties at the four spot between Watkins and Kitts, her two sophomores. They have become a tag team, one usually subbing in for the other early. At times the duo has paired together, most notably when Cardoso missed two games on Brazilian National Team duty. Watkins has grown into a lockdown defender, a ruthless shot blocker and agile mover on the perimeter.\nSkills she, like Feagin, has had to grow into and become more assertive with this season.\n“It feels good to just showcase what I can do,” Watkins said. “Especially if I’m playing, I can really show what I'm doing. It feels good.”\nFor Kitts, the game is finally slowing down a little bit after joining the program midway through last season. Just being on the roster last year had her way ahead of schedule, making the trip to Dallas at a time when she still should have been finishing her last semester of high school.\nBring it forward 12 months, and you get a confident, strong player who started 29 times this year and averaged 9.3 points per game and is an efficient 15-of-22 with 40 points so far in the NCAA Tournament.\n“It’s definitely a different experience than last year,” Kitts told GamecockScoop. “This year I’m playing. Last year I was just part of the team. It feels different; I feel like I’m able to impact the game.”\nAll three have grown this year. All three have stepped into increased roles after Aliyah Boston and Victaria Saxton departed for the WNBA.\nAnd undeniably, the Gamecocks would not be in their fourth consecutive Final Four without the contributions of these three post players.\n“Those three, we need them,” Staley said. “We need them to play. We need them to play well, and we need them just to be who they've been all season long.”\nFinally, this is their moment.",
