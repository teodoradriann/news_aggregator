    "title": "Mumbai Diary: Senior BJP leaders seek shot at fame",
    "text": "During his tenure as the Chief Minister and later as the Leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis had cut to size other Maharashtra BJP top brass seeking to lay claim on the Chief Minister’s Office. Now, after a BJP debacle in the Lok Sabha polls, these ‘sidelined’ leaders see a window of opportunity to make a return into active politics. One such leader, Ekanth Khadse, who joined NCP following a fiery exchange with state BJP leadership, wants to return to his former party. Pankaja Munde, who lost against the NCP (SP) candidate Bajrang Sonawane, in a bid to remain relevant, is lending active support to OBC agitation.\nAnother Pawar in Baramati?\nIn the Baramati Lok Sabha seat, deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s brother Srinivas Pawar campaigned for Supriya Sule and not his brother’s spouse Sunetra Pawar. Srinivas’s son Yogendra Pawar was the first to make the move against his uncle Ajit Pawar, actively rallying in support for auut Supriya. Sule won LS election by over 1.50 lakh votes, including a 48,000-vote-lead in Baramati assembly segment. Yogendra Pawar sees this significant margin to Supriya Sule in the assembly as a window to keep foot in the arena of assembly polls against his uncle Ajit in the coming days.\nSuccessful strategist to aid Cong in Maha\nThe Congress has decided to engage political strategist Sunil Kanugolu for the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections. Kanugolu and his team have worked with Congress in the Karnataka and Telangana assembly polls and is already in Mumbai where they have started working with the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress to design an effective strategy and campaign theme, seeking to replicate its success in Karnataka. The process of data mining and subsequent trend analysis has been initiated in full force, sources said, saying that multiple parameters are being considered while refraining from disclosing any more information.\nSudhir Suryawanshi\nOur correspondent in Maharashtra\nsuryawanshi.sudhir@gmail.com",

    "text": "像玩游戏一样培养AI虚拟细胞\n本报讯（记者温才妃）近日，西湖大学医学院长聘副教授郭天南团队在《细胞研究》发表文章，探讨人工智能（AI）虚拟细胞的发展方向。\nAI虚拟细胞通过AI和多模态数据整合，构建精确且可扩展的虚拟细胞模型。相比传统的虚拟细胞建模方法，AI虚拟细胞能够更全面地模拟细胞功能，并具有高通量仿真能力，甚至在某些情况下可以替代实验室实验。\n郭天南解释说，可以用一个“智能细胞培养游戏”理解AI虚拟细胞。想象一下，你正在玩一款“元宇宙细胞培养师”的高级模拟游戏。在这个游戏中，你的任务是培养和优化各种虚拟细胞。\n三大数据支柱就像游戏的三个核心模块：先验知识是游戏的“百科全书”，包含了所有已知的细胞生物学信息；静态结构是细胞的“3D建模器”，让你能看到细胞的精细结构；动态状态是细胞的“实时监测系统”，显示细胞内各种分子的实时变化。AI虚拟细胞就是游戏中培养的“智能虚拟细胞”。它综合了上述3个模块的信息，能够模拟真实细胞的行为和反应。\n闭环主动学习系统则像是游戏中的自动实验室。它会自动识别虚拟细胞那些未知的特性。然后，它会设计并执行虚拟实验探索这些未知领域。实验结果会立即用于更新和改进虚拟细胞模型。\n这个“智能细胞培养游戏”不断循环运行，每次实验都让虚拟细胞变得更加真实和精确。随着“游戏”的进行，虚拟细胞会越来越像真实的细胞，甚至可能揭示一些在现实世界中尚未发现的细胞特性。这样，研究者就能在电脑中培养各种各样的“细胞盆栽”，用于研究生命科学，而不需要真实的实验室和大量资源。\n据研究人员介绍，AI虚拟细胞有望在药物研发、疾病建模和基础生物学研究中发挥重要作用。\n相关论文信息：https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-025-01101-y",
