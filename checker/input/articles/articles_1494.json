    "title": "Tap water with foul smell and taste is reported in New Jersey",
    "text": "By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com ,\n1 hours ago Customers in those areas received the notification at 9:30 pm ET and an update is expected by 9:45 pm Thursday. Residents have reported a metallic taste and a smell similar to paint thinner. The tainted tap water has led many on social media to speculate that drones flying over New Jersey may be connected to the changes, as initial sightings occurred over the Raritan River—a vital source for the Raritan System. However, some residents have attributed the issues to a water main that broke at 7 am on Tuesday in Union City. American Water has not specified if the water main break was the cause for issues with the Raritan System's water. The mystery has left many residents frustrated, with one person sharing on Reddit: 'I'm surprised they don't give any directions... is it safe to drink, touch skin, etc.? Kinda wild that they omit the most important information for the customer.' American Water said it began flushing hydrants last night, continuing into Thursday in an effort to help clear out the system. [This may result in low pressure and/or discoloration. If your water is discolored, run the cold-water taps only, at the lowest level of the house for about 3 to 5 minutes until the water runs clear,' the company said in a press release. Residents in Hillsborough, where a drone allegedly crashed last week, and other towns have been told not to drink tap water and use bottled until further notice. But as drones have invaded the skies over New Jersey for more than a month, conspiracy theories are swirling about the water changes. 'So there's been countless unidentified drones flying over our reservoirs completely unfettered, and now the water from an entire reservoir smells and tastes bad,' a New Jersey resident shared online. 'And they are 100% sure there is no connection, even though we don't know who is flying the drones, why the drones are flying, why they are over reservoirs, and why the water smells and tastes bad.' A Facebook Group, New Jersey Mystery Drones - let's solve it, features a thread about the mysterious water issues. A Hillsborough resident posted: 'This could be completely unrelated and I am hoping that's the case....There are reports of foul smelling and tasting water in and around Hillsborough 08844. People are stating it tastes like nail polish. Any insight is appreciated.' The first comment reads: 'Drones flying over reservoirs spraying stuff. Go figure. My country is run by idiots.' Another New Jersey local shared the claims, saying: 'I've seen this coming and warned everyone a couple days ago but everyone laughed at me. 'Guess that's what happens when Drones are seen spraying everywhere including water reservoirs.' However, others commenting on the post share the issues with their tap water. 'Over the past month I've had 2 distinctive occasions when I've came in from outside and told my wife I have a metallic taste in my mouth,' one person shared. While another said she was happy to have read the alert before bathing her one-year-old. And many New Jerseyans warned the others to not drink the water. Over the past month, I've had 2 distinctive occasions when I've came in from outside and told my wife I have a metallic taste in my mouth. While a mother said she was glad to read the post before bathing her baby with the smelly water. The first New Jersey drone sightings appeared over the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal on November 18. Officials then started receiving reports of craft flying of water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations. The White House has stated multiple times that it has 'not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that people are misidentifying hobbyists, planes, and even stars as drones. He noted that the FBI had received tips on 5,000 drone sightings in recent weeks, of which 100 were deemed worthy of further investigation. Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

    "text": "Aumenta tensão entre Israel e Hezbollah na fronteira com o Líbano\nRegião já sofre com a pior guerra em décadas, no conflito desigual entre Israel e a Palestina, representada pelo grupo Hamas, desde o início de outubro\nPublicado 28/12/2023 - 18h53\nSão Paulo – Segundo informações divulgadas nas últimas 24 horas na Europa e Oriente Médio, o grupo libanês xiita Hezbollah vem disparando dezenas de foguetes e enviando drones com explosivos contra o norte de Israel. O mais recente desses ataques foi nesta quinta-feira (28). Com isso, aumenta a tensão e o risco de se alastrar a guerra na região, que já sofre com a pior guerra em décadas, no conflito desigual entre Israel e a Palestina, representada pelo grupo Hamas.\nNa segunda-feira (25), um\nataque aéreo israelense nas proximidades de Damasco (Síria) matou o conselheiro sênior da Guarda Revolucionária do Irã (GRI), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, responsável pela coordenação da aliança militar entre a Síria e o Irã.\n“Ou o Hezbollah se afasta da fronteira israelense (com o Líbano), de acordo com a Resolução 1701 da ONU, ou nós mesmos o afastaremos”, ameaçou ontem o porta-voz do gabinete do primeiro-ministro israelense Binyamin Netanyahu,\nEylon Levy.\nOntem o Hezbollah lançou o maior número de ataques na fronteira em um único dia desde 8 de outubro, de acordo com relato divulgado pela Agência Reuters. “A situação na fronteira norte de Israel exige mudanças”, afirmou o ex-primeiro-ministro israelense Benny Gantz.\nCitando como fonte o grupo xiita, a agência Al Jazeera reporta que um “atentado” israelense na noite de terça-feira (26) teve como alvo uma casa na cidade fronteiriça de Bint Jbeil, matando um combatente do Hezbollah e dois parentes. Depois disso, o grupo libanês afirmou ter disparado até 30 foguetes Katyusha contra a cidade israelense de Kiryat Shmona.\nAmeaças sionistas\n“O cronômetro para uma solução diplomática está quase zerado. Se o mundo e o governo libanês não agirem para evitar os disparos sobre os habitantes do norte de Israel e afastar o Hezbollah da fronteira, as Forças de Defesa de Israel o farão”, disse Gantz, usando palavras semelhantes às do porta-voz de Netanyahu, que já ameaçou transformar “unilateralmente Beirute e o sul do Líbano, a pouca distância daqui, em Gaza e Khan Yunis (cidade no sul da Faixa de Gaza)”, caso o Hezbollah partisse para uma guerra aberta.\nO grupo xiita é financiado pelo Irã e considerado a força militar não-estatal mais poderosa do Oriente Médio. Em 2006, uma guerra entre o Hezbollah e Israel teve início quando a organização islâmica desferiu um ataque a tropas israelenses, que em resposta invadiram o sul do Líbano, na maior ação militar no país árabe desde a invasão de 1982.\nBarbárie em Gaza\nAs forças israelenses não se restringem à retórica. Segundo o jornal britânico The Guardian, os militares israelenses disseram “lamentar os danos” causados por um ataque das Forças de Defesa de Israel (IDF) que matou dezenas de pessoas no campo de refugiados de Maghazi, no centro de Gaza, no início desta semana. Morreram cerca de 90 pessoas só nesse ataque.\nEm nota divulgada hoje, o Alto Comissário da ONU para os Direitos Humanos, Volker Türk, declarou que “o uso de táticas e armas militares em contextos de aplicação da lei, o uso de\nforça desnecessária e desproporcional e a aplicação de restrições amplas, arbitrárias e discriminatórias ao movimento que afetam os palestinos são extremamente preocupantes”.",

    "text": "Market movers Investor updates on key trending stocks\nSky to cut 2,000 jobs at customer service centres and close three sites in UK Julia Kollewe Thu, 27 Mar 2025, 4:32 pm 2 min read\nSky expects its calls to drop from 25m to 17m annually in the next few years. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Sky has said it intends to cut 2,000 jobs at its customer service centres and close three sites in the UK, affecting 7% of its total workforce.\nThe media and telecoms group, which was bought by the US media company Comcast for £30bn in 2018 , said the planned closures would help make it “future-ready” as it shifts from dealing with customers over the phone to digital communications.\nSky’s Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds Central contact centres will be closed, reducing the number of its UK sites from 10 to seven. The company’s operations at Dunfermline and Newcastle will also be affected. The proposals are subject to consultation with staff and unions.\nAt the same time, it is making a multimillion pound investment in its Livingston site to create a “centre of excellence” as it seeks to adapt to an increasingly digital world, amid declining call volumes.\nThe company, which also owns Sky News, expects its calls to drop from 25m to 17m annually in the next few years.\nA spokesperson said: “We’re transforming our business to deliver quicker, simpler and more digital customer service. Our customers increasingly want choice, to speak to us on the phone when they need us most and the ease of managing everyday tasks digitally.\n“We’re investing in a new centre of excellence for customer service, alongside cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable and available 24/7.”\nThe company polled 10,000 customers and said they had asked for greater choice about how and when they connect with Sky, adding that “thousands of expert advisers will continue to provide personalised support on the phone when it matters most”.\nSky cut 1,000 jobs last year, mainly from its workforce that installs equipment in households. It reported in October that annual losses doubled as it spent more on programming and costs relating to its broadband services and hardware such as mobile devices and Sky Glass TVs increased.\nRecommended stories",

    "text": "Man bear sprays carjackers to protect his 72-year-old mother, Washington State Police say [Doc Louallen](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7686036002/doc-louallen/) A Washington man used bear spray to fend off two attackers who attempted to carjack his elderly mother on Tuesday, bringing an end to a crime spree that included multiple carjackings and police chases, authorities said. \"One of the suspects tried taking the elderly lady out of the driver seat but the woman made it hard for him to close the door,\" said Washington State Patrol Trooper Rick Johnson. \"Her son, who was parked next to her, came around and sprayed bear mace.\" The woman's son [told KOMO News](https://komonews.com/news/local/bear-spray-thwarts-post-christmas-carjacking-at-sea-tac-rest-area-by-2-suspects-on-the-run-stolen-vehicle-i-5-police-washington-state-patrol-troopers-james-crime-protection-chelsea-dehart-criminal-holidays) he tried to stop a suspect by spraying him in the face with bear spray, but it didn't initially seem to phase the man. After it didn't work, the suspect got inside the victim's car but was unable to drive away because the victim had the keys in his pocket, according to investigators. \"His face was all red and he was crying,\" the man told KOMO News. \"His girlfriend asked me what I sprayed with and I sprayed her in the face, too.\" The two suspects, believed to be a man and a woman in their 30s, were arrested as Federal Way police arrived at the scene, KOMO News reported. The suspects face charges of eluding police, carjacking, and hit and run, according Johnson. Moments before the suspects were arrested According to the investigators, two suspects were eluding Kent police in a stolen vehicle driving northbound on Interstate 5. After a short time chasing after the stolen car, Kent police stopped their pursuit due to strict laws in Washington about officers in high-speed chases. Kent police officers reported the suspects hit multiple cars as they were escaping. The suspects lost control of their vehicle and stopped at a rest area off I-5 in Federal Way, nearly 8 miles north of their first encounter with Kent police. The suspects tried to break into three cars while at the rest stop, state investigators said. One of the suspects opened 72-year-old woman's car door, leading to the bear spray encounter. Investigators said none of the victims suffered serious injuries as the suspects tried stealing the cars. \"I never thought something like this would happen to me, you see stuff all the time,\" the woman's son told KOMO News, \"He's lucky I had bear spray otherwise I would have knocked him to the ground.\"",

But if diplomacy fails, “we will use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our goals,” he warned. At the emergency meeting of the Security Council, [France](/tag/France), in partnership with the United States, made a proposal to establish a temporary 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon in order to facilitate negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah, whose main ally is none other than Tehran.",

    "text": "L’équipe del Gaslini in missione nel Sinai. Obiettivo: curare in Italia i bambini feriti a Gaza Andrea Moscatelli, direttore di Terapia intensiva, coordina la missione in EgittoGuido Filippi Genova – Partono per curare e dare una speranza ai bambini palestinesi e alle loro famiglie, vittime incolpevoli della guerra. Un équipe del Gaslini arriverà oggi a Al Arish, porto nel nord della penisola del Sinai, dove da oltre due mesi è ormeggiata la nave Vulcano della Marina Militare, un ospedale galleggiante attrezzato con posti letto, ambulatori, due sale operatorie, apparecchiature per la diagnostica e medicinali, oltre ovviamente a medici, infermieri e personale sanitario. Una settimana prima di Natale, una donna di 23 anni, proveniente dalla Striscia di Gaza, era stata ricoverata a bordo e aveva dato alla luce una bimba che aveva chiamato Italia. La situazione a Gaza peggiora di giorno in giorno e il ministero della Difesa ha deciso di intensificare l’impegno, curando in Italia cento bambini dalle ferite fisiche e psicologiche della guerra. Ovviamente il Gaslini è capofila di questo progetto che si articola in due fasi. Oggi, il team composto da tre medici e quattro infermieri salirà a bordo della Vulcano dove, per una settimana verranno visitati almeno duecento bimbi che hanno dovuto sopportare sofferenze atroci. Lo screening permetterà inoltre di stabilire le loro condizioni e quindi l’ordine con cui devono essere trasferiti negli ospedali pediatrici italiani. Il coordinatore della missione è Andrea Moscatelli, direttore del Dipartimento di Terapia intensiva che ha grande esperienza e che, a fine novembre, era volato a Dubai per curare, assieme ad altri tre medici del Gaslini e quattro del Bambino Gesù, alcuni bimbi palestinesi, ospitati negli Emirati Arabi. «Una grandissima responsabilità e un grande motivo di orgoglio per il nostro ospedale», ha detto nei giorni ad alcuni colleghi. Tutti gli aspetti organizzativi, dal punto di vista sanitario, sono stati seguiti da Renato Botti, manager di profilo internazionale che è stato anche direttore generale del ministero della Salute e della Regione Lazio e che da più di tre anni è al timone del Gaslini. Che è stato scelto come ospedale capofila della missione. Gli altri tre sono, al momento, il Bambino Gesù di Roma – ospedale del Vaticano che può contare spesso su mille e più attenzioni - il Rizzoli di Bologna e il Santobono di Napoli. Un attestato che conferma la leadership tra le strutture pediatriche nazionali e che è stato visto dal presidente della Regione Giovanni Toti e dell’assessore alla Sanità Angelo Gratarola come un segnale di grande attenzione per l’ospedale che segue bambini provenienti da oltre ottanta Paesi, provenienti da tutto il mondo. In una prima fase verranno ricoverati nei quattro ospedali cento bambini di Gaza accompagnati dalle loro famiglie che saranno accolte in alcuni strutture convenzionate. Il progetto conferma l’impegno dell’Italia e della Francia nella Striscia di Gaza, evidenziata l’altro giorno dal ministro della Difesa Guido Crosetto, durante una videoconferenza con il suo omologo francese Sebastien Lecornu in cui sono stati invitati anche altri Paesi europei a fornire un sostegno sanitario. «Ci preoccupa che l’iniziativa non sia seguita anche perché a breve le navi ospedale di Francia e Italia dovranno lasciare l’Egitto per motivi logistici e operativi». Non ci sono conferme, per più di un motivo, ma la nave Vulcano potrebbe salpare, entro un mese dal porto egiziano e per questo, sono state accelerate le operazioni per realizzare in Egitto quell’ospedale da campo che, in un primo tempo, sarebbe dovuto sorgere proprio a Gaza, ipotesi tramontata per le proibitive condizioni di sicurezza. Si è parlato di Rafah, al confine con la Striscia di Gaza, poi ora la priorità è curare in Italia i primi cento bambini.",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Eastern Daily Press",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santa figures, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address: “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip.” Dr Joseph Mugasa, a paediatrician, was one of the few international visitors. He said his tour group of 15 people from Tanzania was “determined” to come to the region despite the situation. “I’ve been here several times, and it’s quite a unique Christmas, as usually there’s a lot of people and a lot of celebrations,” he said. “But you can’t celebrate while people are suffering, so we are sad for them and praying for peace.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",
