    "title": "'Diversity' without virtue and shared values brings chaos",
    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker gave a commencement address this month at Benedictine University in Kansas. Butker is a devout Catholic and was speaking at a Catholic institution. As such, many of his observations, such as his expressed preference for the traditional Latin Mass, were intended for a Catholic audience. But other points Butker made had broader applicability, and quite a few of them provoked blowback, including his reference to the \"tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion.\" The National Football League distanced itself immediately from Butker's remarks. \"[Butker's] views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\" said Jonathan Beane, NFL's senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer. \"The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\" It's worth noting that a) the NFL is not a Catholic organization, and b) the league has had its share of players arrested for domestic violence and convicted of wire fraud, forgery, money laundering, counterfeiting, tax evasion, drug trafficking, driving while intoxicated, burglary, armed robbery, aggravated assault, rape, manslaughter and even murder. Perhaps it's a bad look to criticize a player calling for men to be God-fearing, responsible husbands and fathers.

For example, to say I'm \"pro-choice\" explains nothing unless I denote the choices that I'm in favor of someone being able to make. Either the choices themselves have no moral significance (\"Burgers or pasta for dinner tonight?\"), or else the available choices conform to my own values in some way. Consider: Do I think someone should have the choice to smother Granny with a pillow because she has dementia? I can't say \"yes,\" unless I believe killing someone with dementia is morally good – or at least morally neutral. Saying, \"I wouldn't kill my own grandmother, but I think anyone who wants to should be able to\" makes the absurdity clearer. The same is true of \"diversity.\" We hear constantly that \"diversity is our strength.\" But \"diversity,\" without more, is not necessarily a \"strength\" at all. If I were asked to put together a team to solve a complex problem, and I chose a 6-year-old child, a heroin addict, a comatose patient and a homeless person suffering from severe mental illness, that group would certainly be diverse. But it would not be \"strong\" – if by that we mean able to solve the problem. Nor would the group be any \"stronger\" if it consisted of men and women or people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. That hypothetical may seem extreme. But less extreme yet equally clear proof is available anywhere we look. In Europe, for example, hundreds of thousands of young men have emigrated from cultures where women are deprived of basic human rights, swathed head to toe in mandated coverings; those who object are targets for sexual assault, arrest and imprisonment. The presence of those men has transformed countries like Sweden, Germany and England; once known for their low crime rates, they now have skyrocketing numbers of rape and other violence. Similarly, millions of migrants have been encouraged by the Biden administration to enter the United States illegally, despite the importation of drugs killing 100,000-plus Americans a year, or the human trafficking – including the trafficking of children (the government admitted it lost track of 85,000 children who entered the country illegally between 2021 and 2023), or the other crimes committed by illegal immigrants. (The murder of Georgia college student Laken Riley generated national outrage, as did a series of videos created by a Venezuelan migrant explaining how to exploit \"squatting\" laws to take possession of homes and sell them out from under their rightful owners.) Thus, immigration per se is not our \"strength,\" any more than \"diversity\" is. It was, arguably, when we demanded that immigrants assimilate and live by American values. But that would mean defending our culture, which the powerful classes in America are loath to do, preferring instead to condemn it as \"patriarchal,\" \"white supremacist\" and \"systemically racist.\" In fact, the attributes which have made the country peaceful and prosperous – initiative, industry, self-reliance, honesty, integrity, personal responsibility, respect for others, for property and the rule of law, protecting families and children – can be and have been the lived experience of people from nearly every race, ethnicity and culture on the planet. However, the diverse experiences and perspectives that we aspire to bring together for the betterment of all do presuppose not only basic competence but a commitment to virtuous behavior and – more importantly – a set of common values and generalized agreement on what virtuous behavior is. America was founded on explicitly Judeo-Christian principles and populated by people who believed in and lived by them. Furthermore, the existence of shared values and a common belief in the ultimate source of those values made it possible to appeal to that source when the country's policies fell short of our ideals, as exemplified by calls for the abolition of slavery or the improvement of conditions for factory workers. But those controlling today's cultural messaging want the definition of \"values\" to be relative and dismiss \"virtue\" as antiquated. In place of substantive definitions, we now have empty platitudes like \"diversity,\" \"inclusion\" and \"compassion\"; catch-all phrases to be tossed out as accusations whenever anyone points out the painful realities associated with poor choices, or cultural attitudes and behaviors that are antithetical to human flourishing. Butker dared to say what too few will these days – that the source of America's values and our definition of virtue is the Bible and Christianity. Those are our roots, and they are our strength. People of diverse backgrounds who adhere to the principles derived from them do bring depth and richness to the American experience, and we should welcome them. Conversely, we can already see what is wrought when we abandon those principles: discord, violence, societal breakdown. Chaos. [SUPPORT TRUTHFUL JOURNALISM.

    "text": "Israeli air strikes hit near the Syrian capital Damascus and in the country’s south on Thursday, the defence ministry and state media said. “At approximately 23:05 (20:05 GMT) today, the Israeli enemy carried out air strikes from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting some points in the southern region,” the defence ministry said in a statement, reporting no casualties. Israel rarely comments on strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow arch-foe Iran, which backs President Bashar al-Assad’s government, to expand its presence in the country. “Our air defences are intercepting hostile targets in the vicinity of Damascus,” official news agency SANA said. “An Israeli attack targeted the vicinity of the capital Damascus,” state television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported Israeli strikes targeting a Syrian air defence position in the country’s southern Sweida province, as well as near Damascus international airport. The attack near the airport came “one whole day after the airport resumed flights,” said the British-based monitor with a network inside Syria. Damascus international airport had been out of service since Israeli strikes targeted it in late November, just hours after flights resumed following similar attacks the previous month. Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its northern neighbour since Syria’s civil war began in 2011, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces including Lebanese Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions. But it has intensified attacks since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, as tensions rise across the Middle East.",

    "text": "LEXINGTON, S.C. — Eight churches in Lexington are teaming up to host a community health and safety fair this weekend, and they want to see you there! It's their first event since the pandemic ended.\nFolks in Lexington and other parts of the Midlands will have the opportunity to get free clothes, food and medical help.\nOrganizer Anita Boland is the director of health ministries and congregational care at Lexington Presbyterian Church.\nShe said her church has been hosting a health and safety fair since 2009. And over the years, Boland explains more churches have joined in on their effort through word of mouth.\nShe tells News 19 that she learned there was an overlap with New Bethel AME Church down the road, also serving the community's health needs.\n\"Why don't we coordinate our efforts, so that helped us better meet the needs of the people of our community and we said this is just a door to open up to be able to minister to people physically, emotionally and spiritually together,\" Boland said.\nOne of those individuals served was James Bannerman, who lives in Lexington. He learned he had diabetes and high cholesterol at the health fair years ago.\n\"It was kind of hard for me to go there to get all this testing done, but when I found out about my health, I think my health is more important, and I keep on, I go to the doctor every six months and get myself checked with my diabetes. They're doing good the doctor said,\" Bannerman said.\nBannerman tells News 19 he's thankful he decided to go. The screenings will include blood pressure, vision, hearing, dental, cholesterol, HIV and TB.\nWhile the event is being hosted at the Lexington Leisure Center , this event is not tied to the Lexington County Recreation and Aging Commission.\n\"You never know what's going on with your body. You can have high blood pressure, you can have a stroke,\" Bannerman said.\nThe event is Saturday, March 2, 2024 from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Organizers say Spanish interpreters will be available at the health fair, as well as Spanish medical forms.\nRelated Articles Lexington County road to temporarily close for construction Sewage truck will soon be removed from downtown Lexington Some mayors upset as Lexington County's road, drainage maintenance agreement with cities, towns expires",

At the beginning of this encounter, the home team has not suffered a defeat in any of their most recent matches; however, the away team is currently ranked last in the league rankings. [Get Your Sign-Up Bonus!](https://www.telecomasia.net/promobet365) Biskra In their recent matches, Biskra secured victories in 3 games against USM Khenchela, USM Alger, and MC Oran.

On average, Biskra scored 1.11 goals per match in the current league season. Notably, Biskra faces challenges in ball possession, maintaining an average possession of 46.63% in this season. Ben Aknoun Ben Aknoun comes into this match without securing a win in their recent league games. In their last five matches, the visitors suffered three defeats against Magra, Paradou AC, and JS Kabylie, while two fixtures ended in draws against USM Khenchela and CR Belouizdad. Across these matches, Ben Aknoun managed to score two goals but conceded six. In away games, they averaged 0.44 goals scored and 1.56 goals conceded per match. The team has received 19 yellow cards and one red card due to disciplinary actions. Notably, Ben Aknoun faces challenges in ball possession, holding an average of 39.78% overall in this season. Expert Betting Tips The hosts have demonstrated quality in defense recently, remaining unbeaten in their recent matches, which serves as a significant confidence boost. Conversely, the away team has been performing below expectations, showing no signs of a potential victory. Considering these factors and Biskra's strong form at home, I am predicting them to secure a win in this match, with a likely outcome of 2-0.
