    "text": "Le corps présent du père Christophe Adler, curé des paroisses Sainte-Germaine du Condomois et Saint-Vincent de la Ténarèze, disparu cette semaine à l’âge de 67 ans, est visible devant le chœur de l’ancienne cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Condom.\nSamedi 24 février, à 14 heures sa messe de funérailles y sera présidée par Mrg Bertrand Lacombe, archevêque d’Auch, entouré des fidèles. Le défunt sera mis en terre au cimetière Saint-Joseph de Condom.\nD’origine suédoise, né à Vancouver au Canada, Christophe Adler avait été ordonné prêtre en 2011 à Auch et avait choisi la Gascogne pour sa vie sacerdotale\nC’est en 2003 que ce nouveau converti au catholicisme débarque dans le Gers, où son frère est alors le chef d’une entreprise. Un appel divin le pousse à rencontrer l’évêque pour se lancer dans une toute nouvelle vie; il devient prêtre à un âge mûr : 55 ans après avoir fait son séminaire à Toulouse et son diaconat à l’Isle-Jourdain.\nCet article est réservé aux abonnés Accédez immédiatement à cet article 2 semaines offertes Je m'abonne pour lire la suite Déjà abonné(e) ?

    "text": "ILLEGAL ‘CANDIES’ A tip from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency led to the seizure of 4,491 ecstasy tablets hidden in boxes of gummy candies from Belgium on April 2. —Contributed photo\nMANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Customs (BOC) said on Wednesday that it intercepted a parcel containing P7.6 million worth of ecstasy tablets concealed in boxes of food items at the Port of Clark in Pampanga.\nIn a news release, the BOC said the package, which included ecstasy tablets, or “party drugs,” hidden inside boxes of gummy candies along with nondrug items such as Belgian waffle biscuits, arrived from Brussels, Belgium, on April 2. It was bound for Quezon City.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The operation was based on a tip from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) about the incoming shipment. It was carried out by the Port of Clark-Customs Anti-Illegal Drug Task Force in coordination with the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group. Also involved were the National Bureau of Investigation-Pampanga District Office, the Department of Justice, and Barangay Dau officials in Mabalacat City.\nREAD: P7.6-M ‘ecstasy’ intercepted at Port of Clark\nSniff test Customs examiners and PDEA operatives conducted a K-9 sniff test of the parcel, which indicated there were illegal substances inside, leading to an inspection.\nThe package was found to contain seven boxes of gummy candies. Hidden among the candies were 4,491 suspected ecstasy tablets.\nA chemical analysis conducted by the PDEA confirmed the tablets contained methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a prohibited drug under Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, as amended.\n“This operation sends a clear and strong message: The Port of Clark will not be a gateway for illegal drugs. Let this be a firm warning to smugglers and consignees attempting to exploit our borders,” said District Collector Jairus Reyes.\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again.",

    "title": "From Noah Lyles to Antoine Dupont – seven superstars to watch at Paris Olympics",
    "text": "Simone Biles leads a galaxy of global stars at the Paris Olympics (Mike Egerton/PA) (PA Wire) Home heroes and returning superstars head a galaxy of global athletes who will converge on the Paris Olympics. Here are aseven who are likely to hit the biggest headlines. Simone Biles Simone Biles has staged an extraordinary comeback since Tokyo (Mike Egerton/PA) (PA Archive) Arguably Biles’ bravest medal of her career was the beam bronze she claimed in Tokyo just days after withdrawing from multiple other finals due to mental health concerns. The gymnastics superstar subsequently bounced back by winning her sixth world all-around title last summer and she will return to the Olympic arena on the back of a dazzling performance at the US Olympic trials, suggesting more history will soon be heading her way. Antoine Dupont Antoine Dupont neglected this year’s Six Nations to focus on the Olympics (Mike Egerton/PA) (PA Wire) The talismanic Toulouse scrum-half and France captain caused a sensation when he opted to withdraw from this year’s Six Nations in order to fully commit to representing his country in the men’s rugby sevens at the Olympics. But the early signs are that Dupont’s big choice has paid off, after France emerged as contenders by winning the Sevens Series Grand Final – which included double Olympic champions Fiji – in Madrid in June. Noah Lyles Noah Lyles is targeting a sprint double in Paris (Jane Barlow/PA) (PA Wire) American track sensation Lyles is being touted as potentially the most dominant male sprinter since Usain Bolt as he targets double individual gold in the 100m and 200m. The 26-year-old Floridian proved it could be done when he did the double at last year’s World Championships and current form guides suggest he is a shoo-in over the slightly longer distance. His 100m battle with Jamaican champion Kishane Thompson may dictate the extent of his greatness. Teddy Riner Teddy Riner is a superstar of the French judo squad (Nick Potts/PA) (PA Archive) France will hold its breath when French judo heavyweight Riner takes to the mat in search of a third Olympic gold medal. The hugely popular 35-year-old made up for his disappointment of having to settle for individual bronze in Tokyo by snaring gold in the mixed team event. And having won his 11th individual world title in Doha last year, the man known as ‘Big Teddy’ looks in shape to pull off what would be one of if not the most popular host nation triumph. Katie Ledecky Katie Ledecky is out on her own in the women’s 800m (Adam Davy/PA) (PA Archive) Seven-times Olympic champion Ledecky has been out on her own in the women’s 800m freestyle since 2012 and there appears little chance of her rivals muscling in on an event she has made her own. Although she did lost her decade-long unbeaten record in the event to Canada’s Summer McIntosh in California earlier this year, the 27-year-old has rebounded to record a time just half a second short of her third straight gold in Tokyo three years ago. Li Wenwen China’s Li Wenwen is all but unbeaten in the women’s heavyweight division (Martin Rickett/PA) (PA Archive) Arguably the most nailed-on gold medallist of all at the Paris Olympics is not Biles or Lyles or Ledecky, but China’s 24-year-old weightlifting star. Li won heavyweight gold in Tokyo with a massive 37kg advantage over silver medallist Emily Campbell, and rebounded from an elbow injury to win this year’s World Cup in Thailand by a similar, colossal margin. Ominously she warns: “I still have room for improvement”. Novak Djokovic Olympic success has eluded Novak Djokovic (John Walton/PA) (PA Wire) He may boast more grand slam titles than anyone else, but Djokovic has not had a lot of luck at the Olympics. The Serbian boasts a solitary bronze medal from 2008, having twice lost in subsequent semi-finals and also suffered a first-round defeat to Juan Martin Del Potro in Rio in 2016. Having swept the board of almost every other title in the game, Djokovic will be doubly determined to break his golden duck in Paris.",

    "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) — A Whittier man who reportedly attempted to kidnap two individuals on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year while shooting a firearm into the air was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on June 13, according to a news release from U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina Dena J. King and acting Blue Ridge Parkway Chief Ranger Debra A. Flowers. Along with his 10-year prison sentence, Evan William Blankenship, 23, was sentenced to three years of supervised release after pleading guilty to possession and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. MAN FACES FEDERAL CHARGES FOR ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING ON BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY According to court documents and court proceedings, in the early morning hours of Sept. 28, 2023, two victims were sitting in a parked vehicle at Water Rock Knob Overlook off the Blue Ridge Parkway. Blankenship drove his vehicle to where the victims were located and pointed a semi-automatic pistol at them. He tried to pull one victim out of the vehicle by the hair and arm, and he threatened to harm both victims, court records say. Blankenship then reportedly struck one of the victims in the face, causing temporary hearing loss, the victim testified. Blankenship also fired his firearm into the air before pointing it again at the victims. One of the victims eventually convinced Blankenship to let them go, and the victims reported the incident to law enforcement. Shortly thereafter, one of the victims informed investigators she knew Blankenship through Snapchat and believed he had used Snapchat’s location-sharing feature to find her on the Blue Ridge Parkway. ASHEVILLE MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ROBBERY, KIDNAPPING AND SEX OFFENSE CHARGES Blankenship was arrested on Oct. 11, 2023, and has remained in federal custody since. He will be transferred to the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons upon designation of a federal facility. In the release, King thanked the National Park Service for its thorough investigation and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office for its assistance with the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex M. Scott of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Asheville prosecuted the case.",

    "text": "The Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) has made significant progress throughout the year 2023. The organisation has successfully ventured into new geographies while maintaining robust business growth. During the last 12 months, IRS enlarged its fleet by adding more than 5 million GT and expanding its global reach with new customers from Middle East, Europe & Asia Pacific.\nIRS has been closely associated with key technology demonstration projects in collaboration with various Indian shipyards. The projects include hydrogen fuel cells, autonomous vessels, as well as a remote-controlled vessel. All projects are in advanced stages of construction and expected to be completed by early to mid-2024.\nAs part of IRS’ commitment in providing efficient and environmentally friendly propulsion solutions, it has been selected by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to provide classification services for six hybrid electric catamarans with Lithium-Titanium Oxide (LTO) batteries and diesel generators in a hybrid mode to power propulsion motors and other systems aboard the ships. IRS is also working with a Europe based owner for classification of a methanol dual fuelled ship to be constructed in India.\nIRS has updated its ‘Rules for Construction and Classification of Indian Naval Ships in the year 2023 which includes the most recent IMO/IACS requirements, as well as military design features. This year saw the launching of two Diving Support Vessels, two Diving Support Crafts, four ASW-SWC vessels, successful delivery of first Survey Vessel Large, INS Sandhayak, and five specialised barges for carriage of Missiles, Torpedo and Ammunition.\nAs a testimony of growing confidence of shipyards in the technical and professional competence of IRS, Cochin Shipyard is building six New Generation Missile Vessels, GSL will build seven New Generation Naval OPVs, Floating Dock for Sri Lankan Navy, GRSE would be building four New Generation Naval OPVs, HSL building five Fleet Support Ships and L&T building three Cadet Training Ships all under IRS Classification. The organisation is also involved with various new construction projects of Indian Coast Guard including eight Fast Patrol Vessels and two Pollution Control Vessels. IRS has also demonstrated technical capabilities to carry out stealth studies of Naval vessels which were previously done outside the country.\nTo achieve digital transformation and improve operational efficiency, IRS entered a strategic partnership with Dassault Systèmes to use virtual twin technology. The Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform will enable IRS to enhance and implement data-driven decision-making processes across a variety of stages, including concept design, engineering, integrated operations, and maintenance. The platform will also facilitate vessel lifecycle management, provide digital services through a unified platform, and provide end-to-end digital traceability and is likely to go live by Q3/Q4 of 2024.\nMr Arun Sharma, Executive Chairman, Indian Register of Shipping\nIRS participated in key international maritime events, demonstrating its commitment to the industry. It hosted the 6th Singapore Advisory Committee meeting and Customer Meet, apart from a presence at the Sea Asia exhibition during Singapore Maritime Week 2023. During London International Shipping Week in September, IRS organised a round table discussion on ‘Seascape 2030 – Decarbonisation and the Human Element’ with distinguished speakers, as well as a Technical Seminar. IRS MD Mr. Vijay Arora spoke on “Sustainable Ship Design and Construction” at The Maritime Standard Transportation and Climate Change Conference at Abu Dhabi.\nMr Vijay Arora, MD said ’Going forward, IRS will continue to focus on enhancing fleet quality, strengthen surveyors’ capability through regular training and expand its presence in new geographies. It is our steadfast commitment to excellence, quality, and maritime safety that gives us an unrivalled reputation.’\nMr Arun Sharma, Executive Chairman of IRS said: “In 2023, IRS saw remarkable growth and reinforced its position as a trusted maritime partner. As we approach 2024, global regulatory shifts will continue to accelerate, particularly in response to IMO emission reduction targets for 2030. IRS is prepared to handle these changes seamlessly as companies intensify efforts to meet these targets. While contributing to global initiatives, IRS also aligns with India’s ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ campaign, solidifying our position as a beacon of reliability for maritime stakeholders worldwide.”\nSource: Indian Register of Shipping (IRS)\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",

Later, a luncheon with various activities was held at the Garrett County Fairgrounds.

    "text": "Hace días, [Laura Flores](https://www.publimetro.com.mx/entretenimiento/2024/09/05/laura-flores-habla-abiertamente-de-su-proceso-con-la-alopecia-video/) compartió en una entrevista lo que sufrió tras someterse al procedimiento estético de hilos tensores, que le provocaron queloides bajo su piel, que parecían bolitas.\nLa actriz detalló que los hilos tensores son unos cortes que se realizan en la piel para estimular la producción natural de colágeno, y así ofrecer un aspecto más juvenil a la piel.\nSin embargo, los hilos tensores no funcionaron como deberían en Laura Flores, ya que, en lugar de promover su producción de colágeno, lo que hicieron fue que se formaran queloides, que estéticamente se veía mal porque tenían forma de bolitas en su rostro.\nLaura Flores terminó de grabar una telenovela y se fue directo al consultorio\nEn vista de que Laura Flores se encontraba grabando una telenovela en ese momento, no podía realizarse nada en el rostro hasta acabar con la producción, afortunadamente, le quedaba poco para acabar.\n“Yo termino de grabar un 11 de abril en México. Me acuerdo que había fiesta post novela y yo: ‘¿fiesta, cuál fiesta?’ Dijeron corte y yo me fui directo al consultorio”, relató la actriz.\nLaura Flores explicó que, al llegar con su médico, le colocó anestesia en todo el rostro, además le dio algunas pastillas para el dolor, y procedió a cortarle la piel de la cara para seguidamente levantársela y remover los queloides: “me abrió como si fuera una banana que estás pelando”.\nSin embargo, el médico es tan bueno en lo que hace que no le quedó ninguna cicatriz. Su rostro está como si nunca le hubieran cortado la piel y levantado. Incluso pidió que hicieran un acercamiento para que vieran que no tenía nada, ni una línea.\nLaura Flores comentó que le sacaron los hilos y queloides, los comparó con pellejitos. Por fortuna, todo salió bien y su rostro no quedó como el de otras actrices que reciben una mala cirugía.",
