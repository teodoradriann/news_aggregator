So this, had it hit our streets, we would've been awash in it,\" said Snyder.\nHe cited what he said were local fatal overdose statistics: In 2022, 51 people died, while, so far, in 2023, 49 people have died in fentanyl-related overdoses. There were also \"a multitude\" of ongoing cases emerging this year that Snyder said could push 2023 past last year's total.\n\"...Our field tests indicate this is a high potency fentanyl ... so every one of those pills had the potential of killing whoever took them,\" he said.\nYelson Daniel Alvarez-Ortiz, 25; Jeffry Ezequiel Gonzalez-Ortiz, 29; and Carlos Almonte-Melo, 35, were each charged with trafficking 4 grams or more of fentanyl.\nSnyder said they were part of \"a major trafficking organization with tentacles throughout South Florida.\"\nThe men were said in arrest records to be part of \"a crew ... from New York\" who planned to sell the pills in Stuart for $38,000 in a deal set for 12 p.m. Dec. 27 at the Walmart Supercenter automotive parking lot in the 4000 block of Southeast Federal Highway.\nThe seizure of 2.5 pounds, or 10,000 pills, of fentanyl during was announced by Martin County Sheriff's Office Thursday with officials saying the drug operation led to the arrests of three New York men on trafficking charges on Wednesday December 27,2023.\nAccording to those records, when their black Toyota sport utility vehicle arrived, deputies used a \"vehicle immobilization technique,\" arresting the three men while one ran, was pursued and caught.\nThe reports state the plastic bags full of fentanyl pills were found under a seat in the SUV.\nDetectives requested the men be held in jail without bond, saying in the arrest records, each frequented the Dominican Republic, none had ties to Florida and all were considered flight risks.\nSnyder said he hoped they would at least be given a $300,000 bail, but a judge \"for reasons I cannot tell you,\" set their bail each at $200,000.\n\"I suspect with that lower bond, they'll be out and they'll be gone and they are a flight risk,\" he said.\nMore: New Year's Eve cruise: Mystery ship leaves Treasure Coast during weather break\nMore: Cold weather shelter opening in Fort Pierce; Indian River, Martin counties watch forecasts\nMore: Top Treasure Coast environmental stories of 2023\nCorey Arwood is a breaking news reporter for TCPalm.

    "text": "Chandigarh: Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday (February 15) launched the ‘Van Mitra’ scheme and its portal to encourage community participation in tree planting activities in non-forest areas. The members of families with an annual income of less than Rs 1.80 lakh can register to become ‘Van Mitras’. CM Khattar said that the objective of this scheme is to directly involve the local public in increasing forest areas across the state, ensuring an increase in the survival rate of afforestation, and promoting tree planting in non-forest areas. Also Read: Meet Jadav Molai Payeng, The Forest Man Of India, Who Has Been Planting Trees For The Last 43 Years Each van mitra will receive an incentive based on the maintenance of the plant and they can plant a maximum of 1,000 saplings. Any individual aged between 18 and 60 can become a van mitra, according to an official statement. In the first phase of the scheme, the selection of 7500 van mitra will be done through the portal. A van mitra can choose non-forest land for tree planting in their village, town, or city. If the planted tree grows on the van mitra’s own land, they will be considered the owner of the tree. According to the scheme, in the first year, van mitras will be registered and they will be trained and tree planting will be done by them. In the first year, van mitras will receive Rs 20 for each dug pit upon uploading geo-tagging and photograph of the pit on the mobile app. After geo-tagging, van mitras will receive Rs 30 for each planted tree, the statement said. They will receive Rs 10 per living plant for the maintenance and security of trees planted. Meanwhile, in the second year, van mitras will receive Rs 8 per living plant each month. In the third year, they will receive Rs 5 per living plant each month, and in the fourth year, this amount will be Rs 3 per living plant. In case the van mitras wish not continue under the scheme, the Forest Department will take over the trees.

NDTV – Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via the Banega Swachh India initiative, which in its Season 10 is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Ayushmann Khurrana. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population , indigenous people, India’s different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities , people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In a world post COVID-19 pandemic , the need for WASH ( Water , Sanitation and Hygiene ) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition , mental well-being, self-care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness . Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change. It has now been described as a “ code red for humanity. ” The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution , waste management , plastic ban , manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene . Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat, the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.

    "title": "Does it hurt a water pump to run continuously?",
    "text": "Does Running a Water Pump Continuously Cause Damage? Yes, running a water pump continuously can cause damage, although the extent and type of damage depend heavily on the type of pump , its design , and its intended use . While some pumps are specifically engineered for continuous operation, most residential and commercial water pumps are not. Continuous operation can lead to overheating , premature wear and tear , and ultimately, pump failure .\nLet’s dive deeper into why this happens and what you can do to prevent it.\nUnderstanding the Strain of Continuous Operation Water pumps work by using a motor to drive an impeller or piston that moves water. This process generates heat, and the components experience friction. When a pump runs continuously, several negative effects can accumulate:\nOverheating: The motor, particularly in pumps not designed for continuous duty, can overheat. Overheating degrades the motor’s insulation, reduces its efficiency, and can eventually lead to a complete burnout . Increased Wear and Tear: Continuous operation accelerates the wear of moving parts like bearings, seals, impellers, and pistons. This increased friction causes components to wear out faster, reducing the pump’s lifespan. Stress on Seals and Bearings: Seals prevent leaks, and bearings reduce friction in rotating parts. Constant use can cause these crucial components to fail prematurely, leading to leaks, reduced pump performance, and eventual breakdowns. Water Quality Issues: In well pumps, continuous operation can stir up sediment and potentially degrade water quality. While not directly damaging the pump in all cases, it can lead to increased wear as sediment is pumped through the system. Pump Types and Continuous Operation It’s vital to understand that not all pumps are created equal . Some are designed specifically for continuous use, while others are intended for intermittent operation. Here’s a breakdown:\nSubmersible Pumps: Many submersible pumps, especially those used in ponds, fountains, and some industrial applications, are designed for continuous operation. They are typically cooled by the water they are submerged in, which helps to mitigate overheating. However, even these pumps require regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure they are functioning correctly. Always refer to the pump’s specifications to confirm it is suitable for this type of use. Well Pumps (Submersible and Jet Pumps): Residential well pumps, whether submersible or jet pumps, are not generally designed for continuous operation. They are intended to cycle on and off as needed to maintain water pressure in the home. Continuous running indicates a problem, such as a leak in the system, a well that’s not recharging adequately, or a faulty pressure switch. Sump Pumps: Sump pumps are designed to remove water from basements or crawl spaces. They are typically used intermittently, especially during periods of heavy rain or flooding. Although they can withstand extended use during emergencies, constant, continuous operation can strain the motor and reduce its lifespan. Booster Pumps: Booster pumps increase water pressure in homes or commercial buildings. Their suitability for continuous operation depends on their design. Some are designed for on-demand use, while others are built to run continuously. Fountain and Pond Pumps: These pumps, as mentioned earlier, are typically rated for continuous duty and designed to operate quietly for extended periods. They often have features that enhance longevity, but still benefit from routine inspection and cleaning. Recognizing the Signs of Overuse Several signs can indicate your water pump is running too much or is experiencing the effects of continuous operation:\nConstant Running: This is the most obvious sign. If your pump never shuts off, even when no water is being used, something is wrong. Unusual Noises: Grinding, whining, or rattling noises from the pump can indicate worn bearings, damaged impellers, or other internal problems. Fluctuating Water Pressure: Inconsistent water pressure can be a sign of a failing pump struggling to maintain a consistent flow. Higher Utility Bills: Increased electricity consumption is a telltale sign that your pump is working harder than it should. Overheating: If the pump motor is hot to the touch, it’s likely overheating. Lack of Water or Reduced Water Flow: Reduced water flow is one sign that the pump is losing its ability to function efficiently. Sediment in Water: Excessive sediment can indicate a problem within the well, and the pump is overworking to provide water to the household. Preventing Damage from Continuous Operation Here are essential steps to prevent damage from continuous operation:\nDetermine the Pump’s Duty Rating: Check the manufacturer’s specifications to determine if your pump is designed for continuous or intermittent duty. Install a Pressure Tank: Pressure tanks store water under pressure, reducing the frequency with which the pump needs to cycle on and off. Fix Leaks Promptly: Address any leaks in your plumbing system immediately to reduce the demand on the pump. Monitor Water Usage: Be mindful of your water consumption and identify any potential sources of excessive water use. Regular Maintenance: Perform regular maintenance, including cleaning filters, lubricating bearings, and inspecting seals and connections. Check the Well’s Recharge Rate: Ensure your well can adequately recharge to meet your water demands. If the well pump is continuously running, this may be an indicator. Consider a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD): VFDs adjust the pump’s speed to match the water demand, improving efficiency and reducing stress on the motor. Professional Inspection: Schedule regular inspections by a qualified professional to identify and address potential problems before they escalate. By taking these steps, you can extend the life of your water pump and prevent costly repairs or replacements.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. How long can a submersible pump run continuously? Submersible pumps designed for continuous operation can run for 24 hours or even longer. However, it is essential to check the manufacturer’s specifications to ensure the pump is suitable for this type of use. Even with those models, regular inspections are required to ensure proper cooling and operation.\n2. Can a well pump run 24 hours a day? Generally, no. Most residential well pumps are not designed for continuous operation. If your well pump is running constantly, you likely have a problem that needs immediate attention, such as a leak or a well that’s not recharging properly.\n3. Is it okay for a well pump to cycle on and off frequently? While some cycling is normal, excessive cycling (short bursts of operation followed by short periods of rest) is detrimental to the pump’s lifespan. Frequent cycling causes undue wear on the motor and control components. Ensure your pressure tank is functioning correctly to minimize cycling.\n4. What type of water pump can run continuously without damage? Fountain and pond pumps are typically designed and rated for continuous duty. These pumps are built to operate quietly for long periods without overheating.\n5. Do water pumps consume a lot of power? Yes, water pumps can consume a significant amount of power, depending on their size and horsepower. The average pump uses around 150 watts, but larger pumps can use considerably more. If you’re running an electrical pump continuously, your utility bill can skyrocket.\n6. What causes a well pump to burn out? Several factors can cause a well pump to burn out, including overheating, wear and tear, poor water quality (sediment or minerals), and electrical issues. Water quality is a major concern because minerals can clog up the pump and cause it to burn out. The well liner should be checked, as that’s your best protection against corrosion.\n7. How do I know if my well pump is burnt out? Signs of a burnt-out well pump include changes in water pressure, odd noises from the pump, water spitting from faucets, lack of water, a constantly running pump, and higher utility bills. Additionally, fluctuations in water pressure, strange noises emanating from the tank, and discolored or poor-tasting water are indicators.\n8. Why is my water pump running when no water is being used? A water pump running when no water is being used indicates a leak in the system, a faulty check valve, a problem with the well’s recharge rate, or a defective pressure switch. Contact a plumber to inspect your well pump system for leaks.\n9. What is the ideal cycle time for a well pump? Well experts recommend minimum pump cycles to increase its lifespan and functionality. The well pump cycle time is between 30 seconds to 2 minutes if everything in your well water system works optimally.\n10. What are the main disadvantages of using water pumps? Disadvantages of water pumps include high initial cost, ongoing maintenance requirements, and significant energy consumption.\n11. How often should I have my water pump inspected by a professional? It’s recommended to have your water pump inspected by a professional at least once a year, or more frequently if you notice any signs of problems.\n12. Can overheating damage a well pump? Yes, overheating is a primary cause of well pump failure. Ensure that the pump is always submerged in water for cooling and that the well is adequately recharging.\n13. Are electric water pumps more efficient than mechanical water pumps? While electric water pumps may offer some advantages in terms of efficiency and reliability, mechanical water pumps continue being a reliable and cost-effective option for many vehicle applications.\n14. How many hours a water motor can run continuously? It is advised to run the pump for no more than 10 hours in a single run. Allow it time to cool down and then you can start the motor again.\n15. How can I improve my water efficiency? Improving water efficiency can reduce the strain on your well pump. Consider using low-flow fixtures, fixing leaks promptly, and implementing water-wise landscaping practices. The Environmental Literacy Council offers valuable resources on water conservation at their website, enviroliteracy.org .\nBy understanding the potential risks of continuous operation and taking proactive measures, you can protect your water pump and ensure a reliable water supply for years to come.",
