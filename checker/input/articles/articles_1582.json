    "text": "A woman in her 90s was rescued from beneath the rubble of a collapsed house Saturday in western Japan, five days after a powerful earthquake struck the region and killed more than 126 people.\n>> Read more trending news\nThe woman, who has not been identified, had been trapped beneath the first floor of the two-story structure in the town of Suzu after the 7.56 magnitude earthquake rocked the area, The New York Times reported. She was rescued at about 8:20 p.m. local time and was taken to an area hospital, according to the officer of Ishikawa Prefecture.\nThe Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the woman was responsive but was believed to be suffering from hypothermia, the BBC reported.\nOn Sunday, a doctor told reporters that the woman was well enough to speak, but her legs were injured, according to CNN .\nKume Takanori, a member of the emergency rescue team, told NHK that the woman’s knees had been stuck under furniture between the first and second floor, CNN reported. It took hours to free her, Takanori said.\nThe Times , citing experts, reported that the window for finding survivors after an earthquake is typically three days. It is possible to survive for longer periods, depending on access to water and food, temperatures in the area and the extent of the person’s injuries.\nThe death toll from the earthquake continues to rise, with at least 222 people still reported as missing, according to the newspaper.\nWajima city has had the highest number of fatalities, with 69, The Guardian reported. Suzu has 38 deaths.\nLatest headlines: Hawaii wildfires: Police find additional remains, raises death toll to 99 ‘Life-threatening rainfall event’: Heavy rain leaving roads, subways flooded; some left stranded Hawaii wildfires: First group of residents return to Lahaina Hawaii wildfires: Officials say death toll has dropped to 97 due to DNA tests Morocco earthquake: Death toll tops over 2,000; area suffers major damage © 2024 Cox Media Group",

    "text": "du fun, des news, des bons plans... what else ? Après une semaine calme, le froid s’installe progressivement en France, avec des températures en chute libre. Mais jusqu’à quand devrons-nous affronter ce froid glacial ?\nLe thermomètre semble s’être emballé ces derniers jours, plongeant une grande partie de la France dans une ambiance hivernale . Après un début de décembre marqué par une relative douceur, les températures ont brutalement chuté , laissant place à des matinées glaciales et des journées où le mercure peine à atteindre les normales saisonnières. Depuis hier, les températures avoisinent les 0 °C dans la moitié nord du pays, avec des valeurs parfois négatives dans l’est et le centre-est.\nSelon les dernières prévisions de Météo France, des gelées matinales s’étendront davantage et les températures pourraient atteindre -4 °C par endroits. Si le phénomène reste qualifié de \" temps hivernal et de saison par Guillaume Séchet, météorologue et fondateur de Meteo-Villes.com, son intensité ne passe pas inaperçue . Reste alors une question : combien de temps cet épisode de froid glacial va-t-il durer ?\nLa suite après cette publicité Une vague de froid envahit la France en fin de semaine Depuis le début de la semaine, les températures affichent une tendance nettement à la baisse, contrastant fortement avec la relative douceur qui avait marqué les premiers jours de décembre. Ce vendredi 13 décembre 2024 est attendu comme \" l a journée la plus froide de la semaine à l’échelle nationale \", selon Météo France. Le quart nord-est sera particulièrement touché, avec des maximales limitées à 3 à 5 °C, tandis que le nord-ouest oscillera entre 4 et 8 °C. Plus au sud, les températures atteindront à peine les 10 °C.\nLes matinées, quant à elles, s’annoncent glaciales. \" Ça pourra descendre de -2 à -4 °C localement, tandis que dans l’après-midi, on aura du mal à dépasser les 2 ou 3 °C dans le nord-est \", précise Anthony Grillon, météorologue pour Météo & Radar France. Cette chute brutale est renforcée par des gelées matinales étendues, touchant principalement le nord, l’est et le Massif central. Cependant, comme le souligne Guillaume Séchet \" la première semaine décembre presente une anomalie de + 1 °C par rapport aux normales de saison à l’échelle nationale, mais depuis mardi, on repasse sous les normales de saiso n . \"\nLa suite après cette publicité Comment expliquer ce retour du froid ? Le phénomène actuel trouve son origine dans plusieurs facteurs climatiques. Tout d’abord, la position d’un anticyclone entre l’Atlantique et le nord de l’Europe favorise l’arrivée d’un air frais venu du nord. Cependant, \" il ne s’agit pas d’une réelle masse d’air froid \", nuance Anthony Grillon. Ce simple flux d’air, combiné à une absence notable de vent, engendre une sensation de froid moins marquée que lors d’épisodes de vents glaciaux.\nÀ cela s’ajoute l’effet résiduel de l’ex-tempête Darragh , qui laisse dans son sillage une humidité persistante. D’après l’expert en météorologie, \"la forte couverture nuageuse plaque cette humidité au sol \", empêchant le soleil de réchauffer l’atmosphère. Ce phénomène est amplifié par les journées courtes et un soleil bas , typiques de cette période de l’année, ce qui maintient la grisaille sur une grande partie du pays.",

    "text": "33,000 Boeing union members begin strike\nKING, CNN\nBy Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — About 33,000 union members at Boeing have started to walk off the job on Friday after they overwhelmingly rejected a proposed four-year contract with the troubled aircraft manufacturer.\nThe strike, the first at the company in 16 years, will virtually stop commercial airplane production at one of America’s biggest manufacturing giants and its largest exporter, dealing a potential blow to the US economy. Depending on the length of the strike, it could cause problems for nearly 10,000 Boeing (\nBA) suppliers, which can be found in all 50 US states.\nThe company has a total of 150,000 US employees, and it estimates its own annual contribution to America’s economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly.\nThe rejected deal, which leadership at the International Association of Machinist (IAM) union had described as the best it’s ever negotiated with Boeing, would have given raises of at least 25% over the life of the deal.\nIt also increased job security for union members because Boeing promised to build its next commercial jet, which has yet to be announced, at a unionized plant. Without a contract including that provision, Boeing may decide to build the jet at a non-union factory.\nBut 95% of members of the IAM union voted against the deal. In a separate vote, 96% voted to authorize a strike, easily clearing the two-thirds threshold needed to approve a walkout. The strike began at 11:59 pm PT Thursday, or 2:59 am ET Friday.\n“This is about fighting for our future,” Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing, said as he announced the vote results. “We will be back at the table whenever we can get there to drive forward on the issues our members say are important.”\nBoeing said it was also eager to return to the negotiating table to reach a new deal.\n“The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” it said in a statement. “We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union.”\nPast concessions and a series of problems at Boeing, including\nlayoffs and the shift of some work from a unionized assembly plant to the company’s one non-union factory, had sparked widespread anger at the company. So the vote against the contract was expected, despite what was included in the offer.\nEarlier this week, Kelly Ortberg, Boeing’s new CEO, had acknowledged that members had been upset over past contract terms, but he urged union members to move past that and vote for the deal.\n“I know the reaction to our tentative agreement with the IAM has been passionate,” he wrote to employees. “I understand and respect that passion, but I ask you not to sacrifice the opportunity to secure our future together, because of the frustrations of the past.”\nOrtberg said in his first week on the job last month that he wanted to “reset our relationship” with the union. While\nHolden told CNN late last month that he had not seen any change in negotiation strategy since Ortberg assumed the top job, he said Thursday night that he didn’t necessarily blame the company’s new boss for the strike.\n“It’s hard to make up for 16 years,” he said. “It’s really [about] what has happened to our members … by the leadership of the company for close to 20 years.”\nA slew of incidents\nDespite years of problems, Boeing is still a major component of the US economy. The strike is just the latest body blow for the company.\nIn the last five years, Boeing has suffered a myriad of problems, some tragic and many embarrassing. Most of them have proven financially devastating.\nTwo fatal crashes of its 737 Max, one in October 2018 and the other in March 2019, killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of Boeing’s best-selling plane and a halt in deliveries to fix a design flaw tied to the crashes.\nBoeing then faced a series of other questions about the quality and safety of its planes. That scrutiny grew after a\ndoor plug blew off a 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines shortly after takeoff on January 5. Although no one was killed or seriously injured, the incident sparked numerous federal investigations, one of which revealed the plane had left a Boeing factory without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\nSince then, Boeing has\nagreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges of deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration during the initial investigation of the Max. As part of its agreement with the US Justice Department, the company will have to operate under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\nA strike would not affect consumer travel. Boeing planes that have already been delivered to airlines and those currently in use around the world will continue to fly. But, the strike would cause a delay in deliveries of jets promised to airlines, cutting off Boeing’s primary source of cash.\nNear ‘junk’ status\nBut the company has not reported an annual profit since 2018, running up cumulative core operating\nlosses of more than $33 billion through the second quarter of this year, and its credit rating has been downgraded to near “junk” status. Even before the strike, the company had not been expected to return to profitability in the immediate future due to limits on its production output. The stock was down near 4% in premarket trading.\nShares in Boeing have lost more than 60% of their value in the last five years, and more than 30% since the Alaska Air incident at the start of the year.\nIn announcing the tentative agreement Sunday, Holden had called it “the best contract we’ve negotiated in our history.” But the overwhelming backlash against the deal soon made him change his comments in recent days.\nHolden told members in a message Tuesday that the union leadership recommended workers approve the deal because it was the best that it could negotiate without a strike.\n“We recommended acceptance because we can’t guarantee we can achieve more in a strike,” he said in that message. “But that is your decision to make and is a decision that we will protect and support, no matter what. We have secured all that we could in bargaining short of a strike. The membership must take it from here.”\nAt a press conference after announcing the votes, Holden denied that union leadership was not representing the interest of its members when recommending a deal that was later overwhelmingly rejected.\n“Our members have the final say. And we placed it in their hands. This is exactly how it should be,” he said. “Our members spoke loud and clear tonight. I’m proud of our members. I’m proud of them for standing up and fighting for more, for each other, for their families, for the community. There’s a lot at stake here for our members.”\nNo single issue\nHolden said it’s hard to pinpoint a single reason why members voted against the contract, acknowledging workers wanted better job security, more time off and higher wages to make up for rising prices during a period of high inflation over the past several years.\nReferring to the loss of the traditional pension plan in recent contracts, he said: “I know that many members haven’t healed from that wound.”\n“We went through a period of 10 years with stagnated wages,” Holden said. “We’ve had the same schedule for over 30 years, and our members deserve a fair work-life balance.”\nThe most recent strike at Boeing was in 2008 and lasted 57 days. Holden said members are prepared to “stay out” as long as it takes to get a better deal this time.\nAmerica’s labor movement has been active over the past year, particularly as inflation took a bite out of workers’ pay checks. According to analysis by CNN, nearly one million union members\nwon immediate wage increases of 10% or more from late 2022 through the end of 2023. Strikes at all three unionized US automakers began almost exactly a year ago and lasted seven weeks, the longest auto strike in 25 years. That motivated Boeing workers to take action, Holden said.\n“There were a lot of awesome wins in the labor movement, and I think that momentum is something that helped us, that brought confidence to our members,” he said. “We certainly looked at that as something to aspire too as well. So we’re hoping to continue the labor movement success with our action here tonight.”\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
