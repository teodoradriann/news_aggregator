    "text": "J&KIMD forecasts isolated fog in JK; Dense fog leads to significant disruptions in air, train traffic By KNS Posted on Dec 29, 2023 | Updated on Dec 29, 2023 Share Tweet Share Ishtiyaq Ahmad Srinagar, Dec 29 (KNS): The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a weather forecast indicating the likelihood of fog at isolated places over Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days. The advisory comes as part of the routine weather updates provided by the IMD to keep citizens and authorities informed on potential weather-related disruptions. According to the latest forecast, certain areas in Jammu and Kashmir are expected to experience foggy conditions, impacting visibility and posing potential challenges for commuters and travelers. News agency KNS reported that the IMD has urged residents, as well as those planning to travel through the region, to exercise caution and stay updated on the evolving weather conditions. Fog can significantly affect transportation, including road and air travel, as reduced visibility may lead to delays and disruptions. The IMD has advised travelers to check for real-time updates from official weather sources, follow traffic advisories, and take necessary precautions while navigating through fog-prone areas. The meteorological department uses advanced technology and data analysis to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts, enabling individuals and authorities to prepare for adverse conditions. In light of the fog alert for Jammu and Kashmir, local authorities are expected to take necessary measures to mitigate potential challenges and ensure the safety of the public. The IMD regularly monitors and analyzes atmospheric conditions to provide forecasts and warnings for various weather phenomena, including fog, rain, and snow. The information is crucial for planning and decision-making, especially in regions prone to specific weather patterns. As residents and travelers in Jammu and Kashmir brace for possible foggy conditions, it is recommended to stay tuned to official weather updates and follow safety guidelines issued by local authorities. The IMD's efforts in providing accurate and timely forecasts contribute to enhancing preparedness and reducing the impact of adverse weather events on the community. Meanwhile dense fog wreaked havoc on air, train, and vehicular traffic in the northern region today, leading to the cancellation of six flights at Jammu airport. Train schedules were severely impacted, with Malwa Express arriving 12 hours late, Humsafar Express delayed by 13 hours, and Madras Express facing an 11-hour delay at Jammu Railway Station. Jammu experienced a significant drop in temperature; registering 5 degrees Celsius lower than the previous day. Drivers coped with the challenging conditions by using dippers and fog lamps, while some parked their vehicles on the roadside, awaiting improved visibility. A slight improvement in weather conditions was observed only after 11 am. The Meteorological Department reported that Jammu is expected to witness dry weather with dense fog for the next four days. Additionally, there is a forecast for light rain and snow in certain areas of Jammu and Kashmir on January 3-4. Dense fog significantly impacted air traffic in Jammu, resulting in the cancellation of six out of 15 scheduled flights, with one flight being diverted. Of the flights that did land, most were delayed and rescheduled. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Northern Railway reported delays of 2 to 13 hours for many trains arriving at Jammu Station today.

    "text": "We’re having some colder days, but Southern Californians know better than to complain about our climate. Today we put our mild winter weather in perspective. On average, the coldest day of the year for Southern California is behind us, except for areas with higher elevation or the low desert.To give you a better idea of the coldest time of year for your area, on average, climate experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information have created maps showing the coldest days of the year.You can zoom in to find your area’s coldest date with NOAA’s interactive map here. The maps are derived from the 1991-2020 U.S. climate normals — NOAA’s 30-year averages of climatological variables including the average low temperature for every day. From these values, scientists can identify which day of the year, on average, has the lowest minimum temperature.In the West, the coldest day of the year usually occurs in December.In the East, the coldest day of the year is typically later in the season, thanks to cold air from snow-covered parts of Canada dipping down.While the map shows the coldest days of the year on average throughout the United States, this year’s coldest day may vary from the normal based on actual weather and seasonal climate patterns. For prediction of your actual local daily temperature, and to see how it matches up with the climate normals, check out your local forecast on Weather.gov.This chart shows how the cumulative statewide snowpack is tracking relative to the historical average. This allows us to see how well the snowpack is doing to date, as well as how much snow may still be needed to reach the average peak snowpack around April 1. Percentage of normal to date: 42%Percentage of April 1 average: 19% (up from 15% Wednesday)You can find daily updates on the snowpack here. On Jan. 15, 1932, almost 2 inches of snow fell in downtown L.A., the most recorded in the city on a single day.Wind chill is calculated baed on air temperatures and wind speed. This chart shows temperature, wind chill calculations and frostbite times. Frostbite times reflect how quickly exposed body tissue can be damaged by cold.Cold in Southern California is rarely dangerous. but there have been some severe weather events. In January 1913, temperatures dropped to 10-15 and ruined citrus production in the state. The freeze was the coldest in Southern California history and led to the U.S. Weather Bureau establishing the fruit frost forecast program. A freeze in the Central Valley in December 1990 lasted five days, with temperatures not rising above 25 degrees, inflicting an estimated $3.4 billion in damage on the produce industry.

    "text": "[Science News](https://www.news9live.com/science)\nBlue Origin postpones New Glenn launch because of choppy seas in landing area\nBlue Origin has deferred the first flight of its New Glenn rocket. The launch is now scheduled for no sooner than 12 Jan.\nNew Delhi: The highly anticipated debut flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has been delayed to no sooner than 12 January, 2025. The delay is because of rough seas where the first stage, designed to be reusable at least for 25 flights, will attempt to land on an ocean platform dubbed Jacklyn. The primary objective of the mission is to just reach orbit, and the recovery of the first stage on the ocean platform is a stretch goal, and an ambitious one for the first flight of the launch vehicle. The flight was supposed to take place today. The three hour long launch window opens up at 11:30 hours IST on Sunday.\nThe primary payload on board is the Blue Ring Pathfinder, which will test the core flight, ground systems and operational capabilities of the Blue Ring spacecraft, also developed by Blue Origin. Blue Ring can be compared to a space tugboat, with the capability of rapidly shifting between orbits, that can host a variety of payloads and provide transportation, refueling, data relay and logistics services all the way from various orbital regimes around the Earth to Cislunar space. Blue Ring is designed to accommodate both government and commercial customers.\nFirst Flight of the New Glenn\nThe first New Glenn flight will demonstrate multiple new hardware elements developed by Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, including the launch vehicle, the ocean platform to recover the reusable first stage, and the innovative Blue Ring orbital platform. Blue Origin plans to iterate and improve on the hardware based on the learnings of the first flight. SVP of the New Glenn project, Jarrett Jones says, “This is our first flight and we’ve prepared rigorously for it. But no amount of ground testing or mission simulations are a replacement for flying this rocket. It’s time to fly. No matter what happens, we’ll learn, refine, and apply that knowledge to our next launch.”\nClick for more latest [Science news](https://www.news9live.com/science).

    "text": "By Jovonne Ledet ,\n1 hour ago Photo: Getty Images A Minnesota boy was killed while trying to protect his mother from his violent father.\nAccording to CBS News , eight-year-old Amir Harden was shot to death by his father last week. Harden's mother, Cherish Edwards , said her son was accidentally shot by her father, who was attempting to shoot her.\n\"[Amir] wanted to protect his mommy,\" Edwards said. \"It's just unimaginable, an 8-year-old trying to wrestle the gun out of a grown man's hand. It's unbearable pain.\"\nEdwards said she told her son to go outside but he refused to leave her side.\nAfter shooting his son, Edwards said the father shot himself while her four other children were watching. Harden's father is currently in the hospital with critical injuries.\n\"We're finally free of him, but my child paid the ultimate sacrifice,\" Edwards said. \"My children, all of them, I feel so bad for them. They are traumatized. It's going to take years, if it ever goes away.\"\nBurnsville, Minnesota police have launched an investigation into the incident. A spokesperson for the city said Harden's father may face criminal charges if he survives the shooting.\nEdwards issued a warning to women in similar domestic situations.\n\"It doesn't matter if he hit you 10 years ago, he's got to leave,\" she said. \"Next time that'd be your life or your child's life. I think a lot of women think it'll never be them.\"\nA GoFundMe campaign was started by Edwards to raise money for moving expenses and other bills.\nThe Black Information Network is your source for Black News!

    "text": "Tras la escalada terrorista del Eln -desarrollada en los últimos días- en Arauca contra la Fuerza Pública y oleoductos, el ministro de la Defensa, Iván Velásquez, encabezó un consejo de seguridad en Tame, Arauca. (De seguro le interesa leer: Atención: Mindefensa radicó proyecto de ley que busca que Fondetec brinde servicios de defensa a policías señalados por corrupción) El jefe de la cartera castrense expresó su solidaridad a nombre del gobierno del presidente Gustavo Petro con las familias de los tres uniformados que perdieron la vida por el ataque -de la semana pasada- a la base de Puerto Jordán, ejecutado por parte de la guerrilla del Eln. En esa línea, el Ministro se solidarizó también con los uniformados que resultaron heridos, algunos de los cuales quedaron con amputaciones de sus extremidades. (Lo invitamos a leer: En gigantesca redada en República Dominicana cayó el socio de 'el Sobrino', 'narco invisible' señalado de nexos con el Eln y cartel mexicano) Al consejo de seguridad también asistieron el ministro del Interior, Juan Fernando Cristo, el alto consejero para la Paz, Otty Patiño, y los integrantes de la cúpula de las Fuerzas Militares y el director de la Policía Nacional. Velásquez dijo que durante la reunión, algunos de los alcaldes de Arauca solicitaron que se vuelva a decretar un cese del fuego bilateral con el Eln como una forma de reducir la violencia en la región. El jefe de la cartera castrense hizo un resumen sobre los resultados de los acercamientos con el Eln, grupo al que señaló de no haber dado muestras de su voluntad de paz. En esa línea, el funcionario reiteró que el Gobierno siempre ha tenido la intención de acercarse y dialogar con los grupos al margen de la ley. \"Esa voluntad se mantiene\", puntualizó. (Lea también: El exclusivo sector donde 'Java', señalado enlace entre 'narcos invisibles' de Colombia y la 'Nueva Junta del Narcotráfico', estaría construyendo) El Ministro señaló que no fue por decisión del Gobierno -sino que antes del 3 de agosto- \"se la había pedido al Eln que diera gestos de querer la paz, de querer mantenerse en la mesa (...) y fue el Eln el que congeló esos acercamientos\". De igual forma, aseguró que también se le había pedido al Eln que permitiera la verificación del cese del fuego \"porque para el Gobierno no puede haber cese sin verificación y una mesa de negociación\". De esta forma, el Ministro planteó que la actual situación obliga a que la Fuerza Pública cumpla con su deber constitucional \"y responsabilidad que es proteger a la población civil y establecer el control del territorio\". El Ministro dijo que el Eln ha perpetrado más de 27 atentados contra oleoductos (en los últimos días), y enfatizó que la orden del Presidente a la Fuerza Pública -Fuerzas Militares y Policía de Colombia- es que \"deben incrementar sus capacidades para fortalecer el control del territorio\". Velásquez cerró destacando que para volver a hablar de paz con el Eln este grupo debe dar una clara muestra de esa voluntad.

A esto se suma la seguridad de los alcaldes y la verificación a través de la Unidad Nacional de Protección (UNP). ALICIA LILIANA MÉNDEZ Redacción Justicia. En X: @JusticiaET",
