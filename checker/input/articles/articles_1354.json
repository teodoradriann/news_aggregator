    "text": "Jim Donovan has reached a significant milestone in his battle against leukemia. During Wednesday’s episode of Front Row on NBC affiliate WKYC in Cleveland, the radio “Voice of the Browns” shared footage of him ringing the bell at a University Hospitals facility after undergoing his final radiation treatment for the cancer. The 67-year-old Donovan was first diagnosed with leukemia in 2000 and underwent a bone marrow transplant in the summer of 2011 before suffering a relapse last year. “Big day everybody, my last radiation treatment,” Donovan says in the footage. “Twenty-five up, 25 down. What a team I had. What an honor. Ring the bell.” While Donovan first announced his relapse to viewers of WKYC — where he serves as the station’s sports director and anchor — in May, he proceeded to call the Browns’ season-opening win over the Cincinnati Bengals. At the end of the game, Donovan revealed to listeners that [he would be taking a medical leave](https://awfulannouncing.com/radio/cleveland-browns-jim-donovan-leukemia-battle.html), with a cast of play-by-play announcers including Chris Rose, Andrew Siciliano and Paul Keels calling Browns games in his place. [Donovan returned to the broadcast booth ahead of Cleveland’s Week 11 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers](https://awfulannouncing.com/radio/cleveland-browns-jim-donovan-leukemia-treatment.html). Following the game, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski [awarded the longtime radio play-by-play announcer with a game ball](https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/kevin-stefanski-browns-announcer-jim-donovan.html). Following today's win over the [#Steelers], [#Browns]coach Kevin Stefanski fittingly awarded the game ball to… our own Jim Donovan ? We could not possibly think of anyone more deserving ❤ Welcome back, Jimmy [pic.twitter.com/vFsMKuQtQp] — WKYC 3News (@wkyc) [November 19, 2023] A native of Boston, Donovan has been a staple of the Cleveland sports scene dating back to the start of his career at WKYC in the 1980s. Having previously called NFL games for NBC from 1987-1997, he became the radio voice of the Browns following the franchise’s return to the NFL in 1999.

    "text": "When the Switch 2 was revealed for the first time, one doubt that fans had was, “What is the C button on the Joy-Cons?” Well, with the full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, we now know that it is more than just an action button. Yes, the C button on the Nintendo Joy-Cons 2 serves a specific role in GameChat.\nIf you look at the Joy-Cons of the Nintendo Switch 2, the C button is located under the home button. For the Switch Pro controllers, it is located in the middle of the controller.\nOnce you press the C button on the controller, it will open the Nintendo GameChat menu. You can press the button anytime to bring up the menu. To get out of the menu, you can press the B button, and to select a specific option, press the A button.\nWhat is the Nintendo Switch 2 GameChat?\nThe Nintendo GameChat is a feature similar to how Discord parties work. However, unlike Discord on PC or other consoles, this is an inbuilt feature. This means your resources will be checked to keep game performance in balance. The Switch 2 GameChat fosters a “same-room” experience for remote players.\nActivate it via the ‘C’ button on Joy-Con 2 to have a conference between friends. GameChat even works between people playing different games. This means that people on a call can play other games and even screen-share. It also supports voice and optional video chat via the Switch camera.\nUp to 12 players can join, with four screen-sharing simultaneously. GameChat is free until March 2026; it requires a Nintendo Switch Online membership. You can invite friends to start sessions. The feature also includes a safety reporting option. The C button definitely adds extra value to the social features of a Switch console, and with the successor, it is a positive direction.\nWhat do you think about the Switch 2 C button and GameChat feature? Will you use it to communicate with friends after you pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2? Do tell us in the comments below.\nSource: Beebom",

    "text": "Very few bowl games have made a greater impact in such a short amount of time than the Duke’s Mayo Bowl and everybody who tuned into the shenanigans-filled postseason\ncollege football matchup had an absolute blast. The Episcopal Diocese of West Virginia did not.\nIt condemned the Duke’s Mayo Bowl for allowing “an abomination in the eyes of the Lord.”\nThere were multiple instances in which\nESPN encouraged the use of mayonnaise on a pepperoni roll. Originally conceived as a coal miner’s lunch, pepperoni rolls are a huge deal in West Virginia and nearby regions of Appalachia.\nThe\nMountaineers were playing in the game, so the broadcast frequently combined the presenting sponsor’s product with the state’s famous snack. It happened more than once!\nPepperoni rolls with bacon-and-tomato (Barrie), fire-roasted red pepper (Mullen), and unspecified (sideline reporter Harry Lyles Jr.). \"West Virginia's defense and Malachi Ruffin gets stout like this bacon and tomato mayo. Bacon and tomato mayo, 8.5 out of 10.\" – Barrie.— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing)\n[pic.twitter.com/VFONquo66e] [December 27, 2023]\nThat did not go over well with the\nEpiscopal Diocese of West Virginia. It represents 55 churches around the Mountain State.\nEpiscopalians in the Mountain State are wild and wonderful Christians, formed by the rugged and resilient Appalachian terrain we witness and worship in. Being grounded in our worship and in our relationship with Christ, and with one another, we find our witness in the present moment, especially to “strive for justice and peace” and to “respect the dignity of every human being,” as we affirm at our Baptism. We offer our witness as Jesus did, for the least, the lost, the misunderstood, and those on the margins who have no one to speak for them.— The Episcopal Diocese of West Virginia\nApparently, the pepperoni rolls dipped in Duke’s Mayo went against the Episcopal Diocese’s beliefs. God will not stand for such a combination of food and condiment! Anyone who has consumed a pepperoni roll with mayo must repent for their sins by either: burning a couch or visiting\nthe Mothman statue in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.\nESPN’s Matt Barrie, Dan Mullen and Harry Lyles Jr. are among those who must make proper contrition. A woman in the stands may also be included in that list.\nHowever, there is some debate about whether she actually dipped her roll in mayo.\nHopefully, for her sake, the roll never made contact with the Duke’s Mayo. Otherwise, she unknowingly committed a mortal sin that can only be forgiven by the special dispensation from the clergy of West Virginia. God may soon smite her without her having any idea of her wrongdoing — unless the roll was kept dry.\nMoving forward, we have been warned. Do not dip your pepperoni roll in mayo!",

India Stack 1.0 focused on identification, payments, and data. India is exploring the possibility of creating India Stack 2.0, a 3D digital twin of the country. Digital twins, like the ones in Singapore, Barcelona, Zurich, and Helsinki, offer insights for urban planning and governance. They can be used for scenario planning, simulations, and predictive analysis. Digital twins can also help in disaster management and can be created by the private sector or by the government. The GIS & Remote Sensing Centre in Nagaland has already created digital twins, and Survey of India is partnering with Genesys to create digital twins of major cities in India.",

    "text": "HIROSHIMA (Reuters) - Half a world away from Hollywood, citizens in Hiroshima, Japan, reacted to the best picture win for \"Oppenheimer\", the blockbuster that depicted the race to develop the atom bomb that devastated their city 78 years ago.\nThe biopic about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer took in seven Oscars at Sunday night's Academy Awards after grossing $954 million worldwide. But the film has yet to screen in Japan, the only country to have suffered nuclear bombing, with U.S. strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki near the end of World War Two.\n\"I myself would definitely like to watch this movie,\" said Yasuhiro Akiyama, a 43-year-old teacher.\n\"I hope more people around the world who have seen the movie would want to visit Hiroshima and come to the Peace Memorial Park and the Atomic Bomb Dome,\" he added.\n\"Oppenheimer\" will finally open in Japan on March 29, about eight months after its debut. The opening last summer came just weeks before memorials of the blasts that claimed more than 200,000 lives.\nControversies over the film's content, which some criticized as glossing over the human toll of the bombings, and marketing cast doubt on whether the film would get shown in Japan.\nMany Japanese were offended by a fan-created \"Barbenheimer\" campaign online that linked the movie to \"Barbie\", another blockbuster that opened around the same time.\nTeruko Yahata, a survivor of the Hiroshima bombing, last week told Reuters that she was eager see \"Oppenheimer\" and hoped it would reinvigorate debate over nuclear weapons.\nThat sentiment was echoed by several Hiroshima residents interviewed after the film reaped Oscar gold.\n\"I think it's important to have a peaceful world where people no longer fight each other, so I hope this movie will give everyone an opportunity to learn about peace,\" said Miyuki Hirano, a 44-year-old nurse.\nYoshito Ihara said he doubted nuclear-armed nations would ever let go of the weapons, but he hoped the movie could educate individuals and motivate them to press for change.\n\"I have not seen the movie, but I think it's a chance for ordinary Japanese people to learn (about the bombing),\" said Iwata, a 63-year-old real estate agent. \"I think it is an issue every single person in the world must continue to fight against.\"\n(Reporting by Irene Wang in Hiroshima, Writing by Rocky Swift in Tokyo, Editing by Angus MacSwan)\nBy Irene Wang\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "title": "El Benfica supera al Estrella Roja en una noche histórica para Di María | Andalucía Información. Todas las noticias de Huelva",
    "text": "El clan turco formado por Anatolly Trubin y Orkun Kokcu facilitó este jueves la puesta en escena del Benfica en la Liga de Campeones, y ya en el descanso, con los goles del dúo, encarriló su primera victoria, en Belgrado ante un Estrella Roja inferior y que solo reaccionó en el tramo final por el bajón de su rival impulsado por el gol del angoleño Milson. Duelo especial para el argentino Ángel di María, que se convirtió en el cuarto jugador en la historia en disputar quince ediciones de la Liga de Campeones. Dos excampeones de Europa coincidieron en el cara a cara de la primera fecha de la nueva competición. Son dos históricos aunque venidos a menos. De aquellos años de gloria, en 1991 para el Estrella Roja y mucho antes, en los 60, la entidad lisboeta, apenas el nombre. Especialmente para el club de Belgrado, relegado a la sombra del fútbol internacional. Al contrario de lo que sucede con el Estrella Roja, el Benfica mantiene el empeño en regresar a la primera línea continental, aunque hace tiempo que no realza su nombre porque se despide con premura de las eliminatorias cumbre. A pesar de ello, cuenta con jugadores de cierto renombre. El último, Ángel Di María, al que proyectó, joven, en sus inicios, antes de hacer carrera en los mejores clubes de Europa, como el Real Madrid, el Manchester United o el París Saint Germain. El argentino, de hecho, se convirtió en el cuarto jugador en la historia en disputar quince ediciones de la Liga de Campeones. Igualó a los brasileños Marcelo, del Real Madrid, y Fernandinho, pero aún está lejos de las diecinueve que jugó Leo Messi. El rosarino marcó la pauta y rompió el partido con un buen pase al danés Alexander Bah, que hizo un buen desmarque, llegó a la línea de fondo y centró al segundo palo donde entró Karem Akturkoglu que empujó el balón a la red al tiempo que aprovechaba la fragilidad del defensa bosnio Rade Krunic. En una acción aislada pudo igualar el Estrella Roja con un disparo potente de Bruno Duarte que paró el meta Anatolly Trubin. Y a la media hora llegó el segundo de los visitantes. En una estupenda falta directa, al borde del área, ejecutada por Orkun Kokcu que dejó sin reacción a Omri Glazer. El subcampeón portugués alcanzó el descanso con el triunfo encarrilado aunque Mirko Ivanic estuvo cerca de volver a meter en el partido al cuadro serbio con un tiro al borde del área algo desviado. Fue un anuncio de lo que ocurrió al inicio de la segunda mitad cuando el Benfica se relajó y el Estrella Roja creció. Sin acierto. Ni siquiera en un tiro, pasada la hora, de Nasser Djiga en un saque de esquina con el portero visitante batido. Tuvo suerte el cuadro lisboeta que perdió el control del partido. El decaimiento portugués fue alarmante, sin remedio. Y tras un disparo lejano de Di María que rozó el larguero el Estrella Roja consiguió su objetivo, resucitar sus opciones. Y acortó la distancia a cuatro del final, con un buen pase de Cherif Ndiaye hacia Milson, en el corazón del área, excesivamente solo. Se giró el angoleño y batió a Anatolly Trubin en su salida. El partido renació. No perdió tiempo Bruno Lage que tiró del banquillo para amarrar el marcador. Efrectuó un triple cambio con Leandro Barreiro, Zeki Amdouni y Jan Niklas Beste y retiró a Di María, a Kokcu y Pavlidis. Buscó la pausa ante la urgencia y la prisa local que - Ficha técnica: 1 - Estrella Roja: Omri Glazer; Ognjen Mimovic (Dalcio, m.27), Nasser Djiga, Uros Spajic, Seol Young-woo; Rade Krunić (Luka Ilic, m.82), Timi Elšnik, Silas Silas; Mirko Ivanic, Peter Olayinka (Milson, m.71) y Bruno Duarte (Cherif Ndiaye, m.71). 2 - Benfica: Anatolly Trubin; Alexander Bah (Issa Kaboré, m.37), Nicolas Otamendi, Antonio Silva, Álvaro Fernández; Angel Di María (Jan Niklas Beste, m.88), Orkun Kokcu (Leandro Barreiro, m.88), Florentino Luis, Kerem Akturkoglu; Vangelis Pavlidis (Zeki Amdouni, m.88) y Benjamin Rooheiser (Fredrik Aursnes, m.56).

    "text": "Iglesias, sobre Errejón: \"No me alegro de que tenga un final tan siniestro, pero lo primero son las víctimas\" El exlíder de Podemos se pronuncia por primera vez sobre las acusaciones por violencia machista contra quien fue su íntimo amigo durante varios años. El exlíder de Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, ha señalado este jueves que no se alegra del \"final\" político \"tan siniestro\" que ha tenido Íñigo Errejón después de que el hasta ahora portavoz de Sumar [haya anunciado que abandona la política](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/errejon-dimite-deja-politica.html) tras [ser acusado por varias mujeres de cometer violencia machista.](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/errejon-dimite-acusaciones-violencia-machista-haber-motivado-marcha.html) \"Pero lo primero son las víctimas\", ha subrayado. Durante su intervención en el programa \"59 segundos\" de RTVE, Iglesias ha admitido que ya \"se hablaba\" de estas acusaciones en los círculos cercanos al dirigente pero que \"las víctimas no tenían un espacio seguro\" para denunciar. En este sentido, el exsecretario general de Podemos ha dado las gracias a la periodista Cristina Fallarás por haber dado en sus redes sociales \"un espacio seguro para que las mujeres denuncien\". De hecho, el testimonio de una mujer colgado en dicho perfil ha desencadenado la dimisión de Errejón, aunque en las últimas horas se han conocido [otras denuncias como la de la actriz y presentadora Elisa Mouliaá](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/la-actriz-elisa-mouliaa-denuncia-redes-haber-sido-victima-acoso-sexual-parte-inigo-errejon.html). También hace unos meses se publicó en Twitter el mensaje de una usuaria anónima que calificaba una situación con el diputado de \"agresión sexual\". Iglesias y Errejón formaron parte del nacimiento de Podemos y también compartieron activismo político en la Universidad Complutense y en otras esferas. Tras varios años de estrecha amistad, las discrepencias sobre la estrategia a seguir en el partido acabaron distanciando a ambos y Errejón terminó fuera de Podemos. Este jueves, Iglesias ha señalado que lleva cinco años sin hablar con su excompañero y que nunca había escuchado \"cosas como estas\" contra él. \"Cuando yo le conocí no era así\", se ha limitado a decir. Sobre el comunicado difundido por Errejón, Iglesias también ha lamentado que se haya mostrado como una víctima y no haya una inculpación clara. \"Por muy dura que sea la política, eso no justifica que alguien sea mala persona o que ejerza la violencia machista. Y tampoco puede presentarse como una víctima del patriarcado o del neoliberalismo\", ha dicho. Por último, Iglesias también ha criticado que el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, haya dado más protagonismo [en su única reacción en redes sociales](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/pedro-sanchez-expresa-toda-mi-confianza-yolanda-diaz-sumar-escandalo-errejon.html) a Sumar que a las presuntas víctimas de la violencia machista ejercida por Íñigo Errejón. \"Creo que debería escuchar un poco menos a sus amigos cuarentones que no entendían al ministerio de Igualdad, y recordar que, gracias a la ley del 'sólo sí es sí', hoy cualquier mujer puede tener la consideración de víctima\", ha concluido.",

    "title": "After Heavy Rains, Monsoon to Approach Break-Phase Soon, IMD Forecasts Normal Showers in August",
    "text": "Commuters wade through a flooded road after heavy monsoon rains in Mathura. (PTI) After torrential rains along the west coast in July, and intense spell in Northwest India on July 31, the southwest monsoon is now approaching its break-phase. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the seasonal rains are likely to be ‘Normal’ in August. The weather department defines ‘Normal’ as rainfall between 94-106 per cent of the long-period average (LPA), which is roughly 255mm. “We expect good rains over the next week, but after that the activity will decrease, as the monsoon could enter a break-phase around August 10. It will pick up again towards the end of the month, and could improve significantly in September,” said IMD chief Dr M Mohapatra on Thursday. Except for the intense heavy rains on July 31, which also triggered cloudbursts in the hills, Northwest India has so far seen a subpar performance of the monsoon as the rainfall deficit touched nearly 14.3 per cent this month — contrary to the IMD’s initial forecast issued earlier. “Normally, we get a lot of western disturbances. But this time, they have been very week. Unlike last year, there was also no major interaction of the WD storms with tropical easterlies of the monsoon, hence the scarce rains,” added Dr Mohapatra. As of July 31, as many as nine states continue to reel under deficient rains — Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand as well as Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur and Nagaland. The deficit has touched nearly 45 per cent in Punjab, and 41 per cent in Haryana and West Bengal — all crucial paddy-growing states. WHAT LED TO HEAVY RAINS OVER SOUTHERN INDIA? However, heavy rains continue to lash the southern peninsular states which have witnessed 36 per cent surplus rains this month. Meteorologists also pointed to a trend of above-normal rains for Southern India in July for the last five years, while it is just the opposite for North-east India where the rainfall remains Below-Normal yet again. The IMD chief said the weather department had alerted for heavy rains along the west coast in its Extended Range forecast (valid for two weeks) on July 18 and 25. “We had also issued an orange alert for heavy rains for Kerala on July 29, and red alert on July 30. Orange alert means the local administration should take immediate action, and not wait for red warnings,” he added. Over 340mm rains fell over Vadakkancherry (Thrissur), 300mm in Alathur (Palakkad), and 280mm in Vyttiri (Wayanad) on July 29-30, triggering a massive landslide in Wayanad that took over 250 lives. According to IMD, the monsoon trough was south of its normal position for most days of July, which led to heavy rains over southern India. The Arabian Sea arm of the monsoon remains very active throughout the month. As many as three low-pressure systems developed over the Bay of Bengal and all of them moved across Odisha towards the west coast. These moisture-laden winds got an additional boost from the westerlies from Arabian Sea, increasing the rains along the west coast. “None of these systems, which together lasted for 11 days, moved north-westwards, which explains why states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand did not get as much rain,” he added. INTENSE RAINS HIT NORTHWEST INDIA Several cities across Northwest India from Himachal Pradesh to Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan recorded over 100-180mm rainfall on July 31. Over 183.2mm rains lashed Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, 163mm in Dehradun (Uttarakhand), 146mm in Jaipur (Rajasthan), 145mm in Noida (Uttar Pradesh), 141mm in Ambala (Haryana). Delhi’s Safdarjung recorded nearly 107mm rains — nearly 79mm of which fell during two hours from 5.30pm-7.30pm, while it was highest at 147mm in Mayur Vihar (Delhi). EMERGENCE OF ‘LA-NINA’ DELAYED TO AUGUST-END The IMD DG said the temperatures over the equatorial Pacific Ocean continue to remain near-normal so the emergence of La-Nina has been delayed to August-end. This is an ocean phenomenon characterised by cooler waters in the equatorial Pacific which strengthens the monsoon current. La Nina in September is likely to boost monsoon rains, and overall, and favour above-normal rains for the second-half of the monsoon season from August to September, said IMD.",
