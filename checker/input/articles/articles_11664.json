    "title": "Lenovo China makes slow ThinkPad X1 Carbon clone • The Register",
    "text": "Lenovo's Chinese operation has created a premium laptop based around a slow and out-of-date x86-compatible processor – but at least it's locally designed.\nChinese state media report that the machine – dubbed the Kaixian X1 G1d – weighs in at 990 grams, boasts a 2800x1800 display, three USB-C ports, one USB-A slot, and an unspecified capacity for DDR4 memory.\nThe Zhaoxin KX-6000G chip powering the laptop offers just four cores and runs four threads. While Lenovo has apparently juiced the 3.6GHz processor to run at 3.8GHz, tests of the processor rate it as inferior to Intel and AMD desktop chips released three to five years ago.\nLenovo has nonetheless used premium packaging for the machine, which is said to resemble the ThinkPad X1 Carbon that has long been the PC leader's flagship business laptop.\nThe Lenovo Kaixian X1 G1d laptop - Click to enlarge\nPrices start at around $1,500.\nBut don't try buying it from Lenovo.com.cn – it's not there. The machine is being sold at third party online stores, while Lenovo China's own online store is full of machines packing more recent and powerful Intel and AMD processors.\nBut the box does feature on the website of Shanghai Zhaoxin Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd – the silicon slinger that made its processor, using tech derived from the x86 license it acquired years ago from Taiwan's Via Technologies, which made its own modest range of processors before quitting the CPU biz and heading for other markets.\nChinese chipmaker Loongson now just three to five years off the pace on the desktop China's top Office clone copies Microsoft again – with an inconvenient outage China Telecom's next 150,000 servers will mostly use local processors Lenovo turns to India as source of AI servers What gives? Why has Lenovo created – and seemingly hidden – a premium-look laptop with a poor processor?\nTo answer that question, remember that China wants locals to use more tech designed and built within its borders. Earlier this year Beijing even excluded AMD and Intel from a list of approved CPUs, and has also emphasized the use of locally developed operating systems.\nKnow, too, that Zhaoxin has Beijing's favor, and that Chinese media is hailing this laptop as the first time the chip design firm's wares have been packaged into a product.\nZhaoxin, however, has already bettered the KX-6000G. Just last week it showed off its KX-7000 series processors in a desktop PC from local box builder Tongfang Computer.\nOne market that could be receptive to a pretty but underpowered laptop is China's government, which has been asked to lead the transition to local tech by example.\nBut overall, this one is a head-scratcher. ®\nGet our Tech Resources",

    "text": "This is from scitech selected image. Dry weather, exacerbated by the El Niño phenomenon, has left many Filipinos drenched in sweat. But for Silvestre Aben, who grew up in La Trinidad, Benguet, it remains cool up north despite the extreme heat in most parts of the country. “For this time, mga 26 degrees Celsius. Kung sa hapon, bababa pa ng mga 24°C to 25°C. Talagang ganito ang temperature dito sa Benguet,” he told GMA News Online. (For this time, it’s 26 degrees Celsius. In the afternoon, it reaches between 24°C and 25°C. This is how the temperature is here in Benguet.) “Walang pinagbago. Talagang ganun ang weather dito sa Benguet. Kapag aakyat ka pa sa north, mas malamig doon,” Aben added. (Nothing really changed. That’s how the weather is in Benguet. If you go up north, it’s colder there.) State weather bureau PAGASA has recorded dangerous levels of heat indexes across the country since March. Heat index is the measure of the temperature that a person feels in contrast to the actual air temperature. It is computed by factoring in the humidity and the air temperature, according to the state weather bureau. On April 28, the heat index in Iba, Zambales, rose to an extremely dangerous level of 53°C — the highest in the country so far this year. Around 25 areas also reported dangerous levels of heat indexes of up to 45°C on May 9. Topography But despite the extreme heat, some areas remained relatively cooler, reporting lower heat indexes. These include Baguio City, La Trinidad, Benguet, and Tanay, Rizal. In the last five days, La Trinidad reported heat indexes of 25°C (May 9), 27°C (May 8), 29°C (May 7), 26°C (May 6), and 27°C (May 5). Meanwhile, Baguio monitored heat indexes of 25°C (May 9), 27°C (May 8), and 28°C (May 5 to May 7). The municipality of Tanay experienced heat indexes of 34°C (May 9), 32°C (May 8), 33°C (May 7), 32°C (May 6), and 33°C (May 5). John Manalo, a PAGASA weather specialist, explained that an area’s terrain has an impact on the heat index. “Maraming factors na nagpapataas o nagpapababa ng heat index measurements na nao-obserbahan natin. Isa po dito ay ‘yung elevation or ‘yung topography,” said Manalo. (There are many factors affecting heat index measurements. One of the factors is elevation, or the area’s topography.) “’Yung mga lugar na nasa highly-elevated o ‘yung matataas gaya ng Baguio…relatively, mas malamig o lower ‘yung temperature..as compared sa mga low-lying areas, halimbawa, Metro Manila,” he added. (Highly elevated areas such as Baguio City experience lower temperatures compared to low-lying areas like Metro Manila.) “May role din ang distance from the nearest body of water…Kung sa Manila Bay, the more na mas malapit sa body of water, mas may tendency na mas mataas ang relative humidity dahil sa moisture content na dala ng mga body of water,” Manalo said. (An area’s distance to the nearest body of water also plays a role. Coastal areas such as Manila Bay have higher relative humidity due to the moisture content of the body of water.) Warmer Baguio Although Baguio is known for its cold climate, Sam Silverio noticed that today’s heat is different from the previous years. “Hindi ganun kainit compared sa Manila, pero mainit pala compared to usual Baguio weather,” she told GMA News Online. (It’s not that hot compared to Manila, but this is hotter compared to the usual Baguio weather.) “Gumigising na ako madalas basa ng pawis eh (I now often wake up sweating).” Rachel Santos said that the heat in Tanay is still bearable compared to Metro Manila, but she also noticed that it is different from the past. “As compared sa mga nagdaang summer season, iba talaga yung init ngayon kahit saan,” she told GMA News Online. (As compared to the previous summer seasons, it is very hot anywhere else.) PAGASA said the infrastructure and establishments in an area can also influence the heat index. Dubbed the “urban heat island effect,” cities record warmer indexes than rural areas due to the buildings and establishments around them. “Ang urban areas ay relatively mas warmer compared sa nearby rural areas niya dahil sa differences sa structures and materials na nakikita natin sa urban areas,” said Manalo. (Urban areas are relatively warmer than rural areas because of the differences in structures and materials.) “Ang main difference nila ay heat capacity…Mas maraming buildings, mas may tendency na ma-hold nila yung warm air. Unlike sa rural na magdi-dissipate agad ang warm air, sa rural naga-accumulate siya and imbis na mapunta sa upper part ng atmosphere, nagt-transfer pa siya from one building to another o hino-hold pa siya ng asphalt o concrete or metals na meron kadalasan sa urban areas,” he added. (The main difference is the heat capacity. Buildings tend to hold warm air, unlike in rural areas where the warm air easily dissipates. The warm air in urban areas accumulates and even transfers from one building to another. The asphalt, concrete, and metal materials in urban areas also hold warm air.) In Benguet, Aben said that it’s much cooler back in the day when there were still more trees. “Nung bata pa kami, malamig na malamig nun. Kasi marami pang kahoy nun, pero ngayon wala na, naubos na ang kahoy,” he said. (When we were young, it was very cold then. Because there were still many trees, but there are fewer of them now.) — VBL, GMA Integrated News This article Why are some areas ‘colder’ despite extreme heat?

    "text": "A thick blanket of fog has engulfed Delhi and adjoining areas in northern India, leading to travel delays and chaos.\nAccording to tracking app flightradar24, at least 28 flights were delayed at the Delhi airport on Friday, with an average delay of 10 minutes. Reports say dozens of trains have also been rescheduled, or are running late.\nIndia's weather department has said that foggy conditions are likely to continue for the next few days.\nDense fog is common at this time of the year in Delhi and other parts of northern India, as the region grapples with an intense cold wave.\nPhotos and videos showed several cities shrouded in dense mist and haze.\nAround nine airports including the one in Delhi experienced zero visibility on Friday morning, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.\nThe Delhi airport has issued an advisory to passengers, warning them of significant delays.\n\"While landing and take-off continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected,\" the airport said in a statement, referring to the radar system that enables automatic landings when there is very low visibility.\nSeveral airlines have also issued statements urging travellers to check flight schedules before planning their journeys.\nIMD considers fog \"dense\" if visibility drops below 200m and \"very dense\" if it falls below 50m.\nThe weather department has said that Delhi may experience light to moderate rainfall on 6 January, which is likely to further lower temperatures.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube , Twitter and Facebook",

    "text": "Sánchez celebra la salida de Vox de los gobiernos autonómicos: \"Es un gran día para España\" - El presidente asegura que el PP tiene una gran oportunidad en \"la reforma de la ley de extranjería\" - Defiende la \"experiencia acreditada\" de Escrivá para el Banco de España El presidente Pedro Sánchez ha celebrado este jueves la ruptura de los acuerdos autonómicos de Vox y el PP a raíz del reparto voluntario de menores migrantes no acompañados. \"Hoy es un gran día para España\", ha afirmado el jefe del Ejecutivo durante una rueda de prensa en la que ha trasladado su \"alegría\" por la salida de la ultraderecha de los gobiernos regionales y ha llamado a los 'populares' a reformar la ley de extranjería. Sánchez, que ha comparecido desde Washington para hacer un balance del evento de la cumbre de la OTAN, se ha referido en esos términos a la decisión del partido de Santiago Abascal de romper los pactos con el PP en Extremadura, Baleares, Aragón, Comunidad Valenciana, Castilla y León y Murcia. \"La estrategia del PP de gobernar con la ultraderecha ha fracasado\", ha destacado. Preguntado por los periodistas por la noticia, el presidente ha incidido en que el PP debe abordar \"una decisión trascendental\": ser una \"oposición destructiva\" o \"de Estado\", dando \"respuesta a los problemas\" de la ciudadanía. \"La pregunta que debe hacerse es si está dispuesto a romper con las políticas que ha aprobado con Vox. Tiene una gran oportunidad y es la ley de extranjería; es la prueba del algodón\", ha sostenido, refiriéndose a la reforma que el Gobierno ha planteado para que la acogida de menores sea obligatoria. \"Toda esta crisis viene provocada por el rechazo tanto de PP como de Vox a la solidaridad con Canarias\", ha criticado Sánchez, que ha vuelto a pedir a los 'populares' que \"deroguen\" las \"contrarreformas\" aprobadas y romper también con la ultraderecha a nivel local. Desliga el retorno de Rovira de una investidura en Cataluña Preguntado por el regreso a España de la secretaria general de ERC, Marta Rovira, tras haber sido archivado el caso 'Tsunami Democràtic', el presidente ha remarcado que su vuelta se producirá gracias a la ley de amnistía aprobada por su Gobierno y ha señalado que, a su juicio, una investidura de Salvador Illa (PSC) no tiene por qué estar vinculada a la medida de gracia. \"Una cosa no tiene nada que ver con la otra\", ha defendido. En este contexto, ha apelado a la \"responsabilidad\" de ERC para lograr un acuerdo para la investidura de Illa como nuevo presidente catalán. \"Estamos hablando de un acuerdo de gobierno para echar a andar la legislatura en Cataluña. Y yo confío, evidentemente, en la responsabilidad y en el compromiso de todas las formaciones políticas\", ha señalado. Defiende la \"experiencia acreditada\" de Escrivá para el Banco de España Por otro lado, Sánchez ha defendido la \"experiencia acreditada en materia de política monetaria\" del exminitro José Luis Escrivá para gobernador del Banco de España en sustitución de Pablo Hernández de Cos, cuyo mandato expiró a comienzos del mes de junio, si bien ha confirmado que siguen las negociaciones con el PP. \"Por tanto, se impone una cierta discreción por parte de los negociadores\", ha explicado. No obstante, el presidente ha recordado la tradición en otros países en nombrar a exministros como gobernadores de sus bancos centrales, subrayando que Luis de Guindos (PP) \"pasó de ser ministro de Economía\" en España a vicepresidente del Banco Central Europeo. Para el jefe del Ejecutivo, \"lo importante\" es que la persona que se proponga para el puesto de gobernador del Banco de España \"cumpla o no con los requisitos y la cualificación\" para un puesto de estas características \"en un contexto de tanta incertidumbre económica y geopolítica\". Así, ha apuntado que Escrivá fue presidente de la Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal (AIREF) y después estuvo al frente del Ministerio de Seguridad Social donde, entre los méritos que defiende Sánchez, \"ha reconstruido el Pacto de Toledo\". \"Y, fundamentalmente, si uno mira su currículum, creo que hay pocas personas en España que tengan el conocimiento de política monetaria que tiene José Luis Escrivá\", ha zanjado.",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.
