    "title": "'Kraven the Hunter' Fails To Hunt Down One Final Worldwide Box Office Milestone",
    "text": "There were plenty of box office flops in 2024, and while some were easier to predict than others, perhaps the one that everyone saw coming was Kraven the Hunter. The film came at a time when the world was seemingly at the end of its rope with the SSU (Sony's Spider-Man Universe), which features movies centered on Spider-Man villains but no Spider-Man. Kraven was the most expensive Sony Marvel movie yet, boasting a budget of around $110 million, but the film is poised to finish its theatrical run as the lowest-grossing movie in the franchise by a long shot. At the time of writing, Kraven the Hunter has grossed $24.8 million domestically and $34.9 million internationally, bringing its worldwide total to $59 million globally, and it does not look like it will reach the $60 million threshold.\nKraven the Hunter will become the only Sony Marvel movie to finish with less than $100 million at the box office, as even Madame Web was able to narrowly scrape by and get its earnings into the nine-figures. However, while most people view the SSU as a colossal financial failure, the franchise has actually fared better than you might expect. Thanks to the success of the Venom movies, which have collectively grossed over $1.8 billion from three films at the worldwide box office, Sony has been able to recuperate its losses from other movies such as Morbius, Madame Web, and now Kraven. Each Venom movie needed around $200 million to break even with the rest being pure profit, so the symbiote franchise collectively earned the studio more than $1 billion to pad its pockets.\nWho Stars in ‘Kraven the Hunter’?\nAaron Taylor-Johnson features in the lead role of Kraven the Hunter, and even his undeniable charm wasn't enough to win over audiences or critics. Ariana DeBose also features alongside Taylor-Johnson as Calypso Ezili, with Gladiator 2 star Fred Hechinger portraying Dmitri Kravinoff. The Brutalist star Alessandro Nivola also features in Kraven the Hunter alongside Christopher Abbott and Russell Crowe. It almost makes it both more sad and impressive that Kraven the Hunter was able to fail so spectacularly at the box office, considering it has arguably a stronger cast than any other Sony Marvel movie.\nKraven the Hunter is still playing in extremely limited theaters, but the film is also available to watch at home on digital platforms. Stay tuned to Collider for more updates and watch Kraven the Hunter on Prime Video.\nYour comment has not been saved\nKraven the Hunter\n- Release Date\n- December 13, 2024\n- Runtime\n- 127 Minutes\n- Director\n- J.C.

    "text": "Valeska Carrillo takes special pride in being the first in her family to earn a college degree. Raised in Aurora by parents who came to the U.S. from Mexico, she always dreamed of going to college.\n“I’ve been looking forward to my graduation ever since I was a little girl,” Carrillo said. “My parents have always been humble, hardworking people, and I am fortunate that they always understood the value of education and encouraged me to pursue higher education.\n“I remember my dad doing my hair before school and telling me how vital a college education is.”\nHer parents, Alma Delia and Jose Guadalupe, will be there to share in her graduation moment. Imani Saucedo, her close friend, co-worker, and roommate—who will be accompanied by her dog QP—will also be there. Saucedo is graduating that day too.\nA music education major with a minor in Spanish, Carrillo, 23, hopes to make an impact on her future students similar to the one her professors made on her at Illinois State University. With trombone as her main instrument, one of her most influential teachers was Dr. Mark Babbitt who helped build her musicianship skills in his role as her applied professor.\n“Out of all the lessons I had with different professors at different institutions, Dr. Babbitt stuck out most to me,” she said. “Oddly enough, he had the most criticism of my playing. I felt like many professors tried to sugarcoat feedback just to recruit me. But Dr. Babbitt got straight to the point, gave me practice tips, warm-up packets, and repertoire suggestions, which I really valued.”\nBabbitt pushed her to do her best and believed in her when her self-confidence was low.\n“If it wasn’t for him, I don’t know if I would have survived college,” Carrillo said. “He is one of my role models.”\n“I’ve been looking forward to my graduation ever since I was a little girl. My parents have always been humble, hardworking people, and I am fortunate that they always understood the value of education.”\nValeska Carrillo Proud of her heritage, she grew up speaking Spanish at home, eating delicious pan dulce, and listening to cumbia and música norteña. For her recital, she chose music written by Mexican composers. Babbitt had encouraged her to seek just such a diverse repertoire.\n“At my recital, I made sure to not only include the program notes about each piece, but to introduce them in Spanish,” she said. “It was important to me to provide a sense of authenticity. It was a project that required countless hours of research and ultimately took me a year to complete.\n“Dr. Babbitt enjoyed one of the pieces so much, Soliloquio de un Andariego by Odin Zamorano Reyes, that he performed it for his own faculty recital in October of 2023.”\nCarrillo decided on Illinois State after being selected as a high school student to participate in the Illinois Music Education Association (ILMEA) Band Festival. Some of the state’s most talented musicians were chosen to prepare a selection of concert band pieces. It was during the fall of 2018, and the guest conductor was Dr. Anthony Marinello, Illinois State’s director of bands. He made a lasting impression.\n“I, and everyone else there, was captivated by his lively personality,” Carrillo said. “I remember we were astounded with his high singing range. He said, ‘I used to sing with my mother in church.’\n“I chatted with him after the performance about my interest in pursuing music, and he encouraged me to audition for ISU’s School of Music,” she said. “That was a memorable moment for me, and Dr. Marinello never seemed to forget either. Whenever I would bump into him on the Quad, he always stopped to say hello.”\nIn addition, she appreciated the dedication of Dr. Shawn McNamara.\n“Shout out to Dr. McNamara for being an incredibly insightful, understanding, and admirable professor,” she said. “He would go out of his way to help any student and even wrote me a few letters of recommendation. I will miss his general music class where we sang nursery rhymes and played different Orff instruments.”\nPart of Carrillo’s decision to come to Illinois State was due to the tuition waiver that incoming music majors are considered for, based on their audition performances.\n“I must have nailed that audition because I was fortunate enough to receive a huge tuition waiver. It covered nearly half of my tuition,” she said.\nOver the years, she also received the Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore Band Award, the Charles Stokes Music Scholarship, and the Resident Assistant Academic Scholarship.\nApply to Illinois State University Inspired by her parents’ work ethic, Carrillo held a number of jobs to help get her through college. She was a resident assistant in Watterson; then a service area manager at Watterson, working the front desk and mailroom; and she was a service area student supervisor. She was also a Preview guide, and back home, she worked seasonal jobs at the mall.\nJacob Pourchot, a service area coordinator with University Housing Services, worked with Carrillo beginning in the fall of 2020 and was her direct supervisor for a time.\n“Valeska flourished as a leader,” Pourchot said. “She was a vital part of my team, and I do not know what I would have done without her. She was never afraid to put in the extra work, and she was the voice of the student workers at Watterson Towers. Her determination, heart, and focus made her so invaluable in the workplace. I am excited to see all that she will do in her career as an educator.”\nCarrillo said she’ll miss the beauty of campus, its plant life, squirrels, and bunnies. And she’ll miss skating late at night with her friends on the Quad. But she’s ready to get started and is looking forward to being in a classroom.\n“I’ll be substitute teaching in the spring of 2025 while looking for a full-time position as a band director in the suburbs,” she said. “I’d also like to be involved with ILMEA—now as a music educator—and continue to inspire students like me.”\nThis story is one of a series of profiles featuring Redbirds who are graduating this December .

    "text": "For young people growing up in Athens, the University of Georgia provides greenspace to play, spots for annual field trips, and opportunities for internships, among other activities. But, for a group of Clarke County School District alumni, the University of Georgia also has become a launching pad to new discoveries, global travel and meaningful relationships. Through UGA’s Foundation Fellowship, five CCSD graduates are currently attending the university on a full academic scholarship as well as funding for travel-study, research and conferences. The fellowship is the university’s most prestigious academic program and creates a community for top scholars at UGA. “I owe so much of the joy and success of the college experience to the Foundation Fellowship,” said Dani Garcia-Pozo, a fourth-year student who graduated from Clarke Central High School. “It has introduced me to a community of fantastic, deeply kind people who really want to see you succeed. I’ve met one of my best friends through the program who encouraged me to travel abroad.” The fellowship supported Garcia-Pozo’s travel abroad to places like the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Spain and Cuba. His travels helped him become fluent in Spanish. These Clarke County graduates have found a strong sense of community and support through the Foundation Fellowship. “I always thought I wanted to get out of Athens, but after interning with the Young Dawgs program, I realized UGA was perfect for me,” said Patrick Allen, a first-year student who graduated from Clarke Central High School. “Young Dawgs showed me great professors and a depth of resources, and then the Foundation Fellowship was almost like a family.” The Clarke County graduates have remained connected to their hometown, volunteering at nonprofits and showcasing local restaurants and businesses to fellow UGA students. “Coming from Athens I’m more aware of the challenges facing Clarke County, and I’m always looking for more opportunities to serve,” said Ella Johnson, a second-year student who graduated from Cedar Shoals High School. “I joined First-Year Forum my freshman year and worked with Campus Kitchen for a year. This year, I’m focusing on literacy, which was an issue I saw in my [K-12] schools.” This year, Johnson will participate in the Books for Keeps Storytellers Literacy Mentor Program. As a volunteer, Johnson will meet with two students at Fowler Drive Elementary School once a week to help with their literacy and early reading skills. “I’ve also tried to get my friends to get out in Athens-Clarke County to volunteer, because many students don’t realize the need that exists,” Johnson said. In addition to her community service as a UGA AmeriCorps Community Food Fellow, third-year student and Cedar Shoals High School graduate Hadiza Sarr began a project to help connect UGA students to local businesses. “As an Athens native, I’m always being asked for recommendations of where to eat or shop,” she said. “I thought I’d centralize the information and help nascent businesses get discovered by UGA students.” In addition to the Foundation Fellows, students from across Athens have found a home at UGA. Currently, more than 120 students who graduated from CCSD high schools attend the University of Georgia. “UGA Admissions works hard and has had tremendous success in keeping our wonderful Athens-Clarke County students at UGA for their college years, as we have seen them go on to do great things both at Georgia and in their post graduate experiences,” said David Graves, UGA’s director of admissions. Many of these students — and their peers from other communities — remain in Athens, starting businesses, raising families and contributing to the community. Nearly 31,000 Athens residents are UGA alumni.",

    "text": "Google's DeepMind has successfully trained a robot to tie shoelaces, hang a shirt, and even fix fellow robots, marking a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The company shared this achievement via a tweet on X. However, it was noted that the robot's shoelace-tying skills are still in their early stages and need improvement. Despite this, the development represents an important step toward enabling robots to perform complex tasks independently. The robot developed by DeepMind uses a technique known as bi-arm manipulation to tie shoelaces. This method involves the use of both arms, a feature that sets it apart from other robots. The robot is powered by two new AI systems: ALOHA Unleashed and DemoStart. ALOHA Unleashed assists the robot in performing complex tasks involving both arms, while DemoStart employs simulations to help the machine learn from its experiences. DeepMind envisions a future where AI robots will assist people with various tasks at home and in the workplace. The company believes that research into robot dexterity, including efficient and general learning approaches, is crucial to realizing this vision. This development underscores the ongoing efforts by tech companies to create robots capable of performing human-like activities, often seen as a critical measure of a robot's capabilities.",

Persecution & Human Rights Violations: Political instability and human rights abuses lead many to seek asylum. Examples include state repression and systemic discriminatory policies. Political Instability and Violence: Civil unrest and failures in governance create instability that forces people to flee their homes. Poverty and Economic Hardship: Extreme poverty and lack of economic opportunity, frequently exacerbated by conflict, can also force people to seek refuge. Climate Change Impacts: Climate change creates further conflicts and environmental disasters, which are displacing increasing numbers of people, known as “climate refugees” through climate-related displacement . The Impact of the Syrian Civil war the Syrian Civil War has been instrumental in creating severe refugee issues that continue to be felt worldwide. The scale and intensity of the conflict caused massive displacement both within Syria and into neighboring nations, with millions seeking refuge in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, among other countries. The situation clearly highlights the consequences of protracted conflicts and their long-term effect on populations.\nRefugees at the overcrowded camp. examining the Statistics: A Look at the Data\nThe sheer scale of the refugee crisis is alarming. Accurate statistics offer a clear picture of the scope of the global emergency. UNHCR , the United Nations refugee Agency, is a key resource for up-to-date information, providing regular reports on the number of refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people (IDPs) worldwide. These numbers include detailed breakdowns by country of origin, host country, and the causes of displacement.\nBelow is a summary overview of some key figures providing more insight into the global displacement trend based on publicly available UNHCR data (Note: Data fluctuates and should be verified with latest reports from UNHCR):\nCategory Estimated Number notes Refugees Globally Over 117.2 million (as of 2023/2024) Includes those fleeing war, persecution, and violence. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Millions People displaced within their own country. Asylum Seekers Continously Fluctuating Individuals who are seeking asylum in a new country. People Under UNHCR Mandate vaste number Total number of individuals UNHCR helps, IDPs, stateless persons, etc. It’s important to note that these are minimum estimates ; challenges in data collection, particularly concerning IDPs, mean the actual numbers are likely higher.\nefforts and Solutions: What’s Being Done Addressing the refugee crisis requires a multifaceted approach, including humanitarian aid, political solutions, and long-term development initiatives. Several international organizations are at the forefront of this undertaking:\nUNHCR: The UN Refugee Agency provides protection and assistance to refugees globally, including shelter, food, and medical aid. World Food Program (WFP): Delivers food assistance to refugees and displaced populations worldwide. International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: Offers humanitarian assistance, including medical care and disaster relief in crisis zones. National Governments and NGOs: Many countries are providing direct support, including resettlement programs ,and the refugee integration, through the government or partnering with NGOs. The role of International Law and Response International law, particularly the 1951 Refugee Convention, establishes a framework for protecting refugees and defining their rights. Countries are responsible for providing asylum to those meeting the definition of a refugee. Enforcement of these conventions at a global scale plays a vital role and is critical. Supporting international cooperation and diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts in their origins is also vital to reduce the number of displaced persons .\nhow You can definitely help There are numerous ways to contribute to the cause and help war refugees, whether through monetary donations, volunteering your time, or raising awareness within your communities.\nDonate to reputable organizations: Directly support UNHCR, Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, or smaller, local NGOs. Advocate for policies: Contact your elected officials and advocate for policies that increase aid. Raise awareness: Use social media; talk with family, friends about the crisis; and promote accurate information. Volunteer your time: Look for opportunities at local resettlement agencies or schools working with refugee communities. Sponsor a refugee family: Many organizations facilitate sponsorship programs. Support resettlement efforts: support initiatives focused.",

    "text": "A paralisação de trabalhadores deve ser não apenas pacífica, mas também justa em sua reivindicação de direitos. Do contrário, ela configura afronta ao empregador e enseja demissão por justa causa.\nTrabalhadores de paralisação prestavam serviço para uma usina sucroalcooleira\nCom esse entendimento, a 1ª Turma do Tribunal Regional do Trabalho da 18ª Região (GO) afastou a reversão da demissão por justa causa que uma empresa do setor metalúrgico impôs a 11 ex-empregados.\nNo início do ano, funcionários da empresa que prestavam serviços a uma usina sucroalcooleira fizeram uma paralisação para reivindicar melhorias nas condições de trabalho. Após uma conversa com um gestor da contratante, cerca de 40 trabalhadores decidiram retomar as atividades, enquanto outros 11 se negaram a isso.\nO grupo insurgente foi então levado de volta em um ônibus da empresa para um hotel e, em seguida, foi dispensado.\nOs demitidos foram à Justiça do trabalho e alegaram que estavam há 15 dias na empresa. Suas dispensas então foram revertidas após o juízo de primeiro grau entender que eles exerceram de forma regular o direito constitucional de livre manifestação e reivindicação, “sem extrapolações e sem violência e agressão a bens e pessoas”.\nParalisação injusta Em recurso ao TRT-18, no entanto, a empresa alegou que, na ocasião da paralisação, o grupo insurgente ameaçou atear fogo em seu ônibus, coagiu e ofendeu os demais empregados que voltaram ao trabalho e comprometeu a relação comercial dela com a usina à qual prestava serviço, uma vez que elas não fecharam novos contratos desde então. Defendeu, por fim, que a aplicação da justa causa foi legítima, razoável e proporcional.\nO relator no TRT-18, desembargador Mário Sérgio Bottazzo, pontuou ser justificável a manifestação pacífica contra abusos do empregador, o que não era o caso: “Outra coisa é a sublevação concatenada e inopinada de trabalhadores pretendendo a melhoria das condições ajustadas de trabalho — insubordinação coletiva, portanto.”\nAo colocar de lado a questão da violência, ele destacou, portanto, que a paralisação não foi justificada.\nRazões insustentáveis O grupo insurgente se queixava da exigência de crachá para a acessar o local de trabalho, o que era uma imposição da usina, tendo em vista o alto fluxo de prestadores de serviço. Também alegava não ter tido treinamento e que houve acúmulo de função, teses que foram rechaçadas pelos desembargadores.\nOs demitidos também afirmaram que o pagamento de salário era menor do que o acordado. Um deles disse, no entanto, que, para receber os R$ 3,7 mil prometidos, precisaria se submeter a “burocracias”, como não perder a hora, nem faltar ao trabalho, o que relator entendeu serem apenas exigências justas de pontualidade e assiduidade.\nJá outro ex-empregado alegou que o grupo reivindicava, na verdade, equiparação de salário com os funcionários da usina que executavam funções parecidas, o que revelou, segundo o relator, “que os amotinados nem sequer sabiam por que se insurgiram, restando mais uma vez manifestamente injustificada a paralisação”.\n“[…] Ao revés de uma ‘demissão conjunta’ com ‘claro intuito de intimidar e desestimular os empregados na busca de melhores condições de trabalho’, no caso dos autos emergiu processualmente provada a insubordinação coletiva injustificada que, apesar de pacífica, caracteriza ato faltoso grave”, argumentou ainda Bottazzo.\nAtuaram na causa os advogados Diêgo Vilela , Gabriella Rezende , Rayane Almeida e Amanda Fortunato .\nClique aqui para ler o acórdão\nProcesso 0010142-28.2024.5.18.0121",
