[pic.twitter.com/c7yoSnePCk] [October 31, 2024] Esste jueves por la tarde, una manga marina originada en la playa de Isla Cristina (Huelva) provocó numerosas incidencias y al menos un herido que fue trasladado al hospital al derrumbarse parte del techo de la piscina municipal. En total, siete provincias están hoy, día de Todos los Santos, bajo algún tipo de alerta, cuatro de ellas, en aviso naranja: por lluvia en Huelva y Tarragona y Mallorca y Menorca por lluvias y tormentas. Además, habrá avisos amarillos por lluvia en Alicante y Valencia (Comunidad Valenciana). Por otro lado, se registrarán avisos amarillos por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza y Formentera (Baleares) y Badajoz (Extremadura). Noticias relacionadas La península y Baleares continuarán hoy bajo la influencia de bajas presiones, con precipitaciones que afectarán al cuadrante sudoeste, el sudoeste de Castilla y León, Aragón, Cataluña, Levante y Baleares. En concreto, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) prevé chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y persistentes en el extremo occidental de Andalucía, en el bajo Ebro y en Baleares, y tampoco se descartan en el sur del sistema Central occidental. La tendencia se mantendrá mañana, una jornada para la que la Aemet pronostica chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes o persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, Baleares y los litorales de Castellón y Valencia, aunque también podría haber precipitaciones en sus interiores. Para el domingo, la agencia plantea un escenario de mayor estabilidad, pero todavía serán probables precipitaciones en el Levante, en el medio y el bajo Ebro y en los litorales catalanes, el Estrecho y Baleares, con una posibilidad de chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y persistentes en el entorno del bajo Ebro.

    "title": "Seven New Year’s resolutions for prosperous business",
    "text": "The past year posed numerous challenges for everyone as well as [businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) across [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria). These challenges hindered businesses from realising the goals set for 2023. However, the beginning of 2024 is a perfect period for businesses to reevaluate their visions, goals and expectations for the new year. In 2024, here are resolutions you can consider adopting to propel your business toward prosperity and success. - Reflect on the previous year Reflecting on 2023 is a crucial step in setting resolutions for the new year. While reflecting on the previous year in your businesses, you would be able to know what worked well, and the achievements, identify areas for improvement, and learn from challenges or setbacks. This creates a form of self-awareness which will help in setting realistic and achievable resolutions and goals. - Do better with goal-setting Some setbacks businesses face are mostly from a lack of well-written goals. Some goals are ill-defined, difficult to track, and hard to hold the business accountable to. So this year, make sure your goals are SMART — specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time. Having a SMART goal will give you clarity which will help guide your efforts and measure success as you proceed. However, make sure the goals you want to set are aligned with your business’ vision and mission statement, address key areas for development, and be subject to regular review. - Improve online presence There is no doubt that social media is now a major marketing tool for business that wants to prosper. It is known that every facet of life is going virtual so any smart business owner should be setting themselves up for success in the online space. This year, you should increase your online presence. Invest in a robust online presence, including a user-friendly website and active engagement on social media. Leverage digital marketing strategies to reach a wider audience and boost brand visibility. Also, explore new technologies and innovations that can improve efficiency, and enhance the customer experience. - Create a more positive work environment For a more productive business, owners need to focus on fostering a positive work environment for the workers as well as the customers. The business should be open to feedback from employees and customers as well as listening and responding to their needs. You should recognize the importance of your team’s well-being. Implement initiatives that promote a healthy work-life balance, provide professional development opportunities, and foster a positive workplace culture. Remember, a happy team is a productive team. - Cultivate learning culture It is known that if you want to be better at what you do, you need to learn continuously. Encourage employees to share knowledge, seek professional development opportunities, and stay curious about industry advancements. Do not be stagnant, always look for knowledge and experience that will make your business better. - Improve financial management Monitoring the finances of a business is quite important because that is the major foundation of the business. This year, ensure to adopt better financial management practices including budgeting, monitoring cash flow, and exploring investment opportunities. Also, you can always handle every part of your business alone no matter how small. You can also seek professional financial advice when needed. These professionals can provide valuable insights, conduct financial audits, and offer guidance on optimizing financial strategies tailored to the specific needs of the business. - Strengthen customer relationships Customers are always right so you need to put them first to have a prosperous business. It is easy to be overwhelmed with the business goals, ambitions and targets for the year and forget customers’ wants and needs. However, as a business owner, you need to be intentional about adopting a customer-first approach to ensure that your brand continues to resonate with your target audience. To build a strong customer relationship, you can include personalized communication, loyalty programs, and actively seeking and responding to feedback and complaints. The year started on a Monday remember, meaning it is standing on business. You should do the same. Copyright 2024 TheCable. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Missing for two years, Delhi boy is reunited with family — on his 10th birthday\nPolicemen had found the boy, who was mentally challenged, wandering around the Anand Vihar bus terminal last February, unattended. He could neither tell them the names of his parents nor his address. The only thing he could confidently say was his name.\nUpasika SinghalNew Delhi | December 6, 2024 03:43 IST\nFor a 10-year-old boy, staying at a shelter home for nearly two years, his birthday this year was one he would never forget. The reason? He was reunited with his mother, whom he had last seen in February 2023.\nPolicemen had found the boy, who was mentally challenged, wandering around the Anand Vihar bus terminal last February, unattended. He could neither tell them the names of his parents nor his address. The only thing he could confidently say was his name.\nThe policemen ended up dropping him off at a shelter home in Ghaziabad. The boy would stay there for nearly two years before he could go back home to Narela Industrial Area after the police came across a missing person’s complaint while looking into pending cases.\nOn February 17, 2023, the boy’s mother had reported him missing to the police, two days after he disappeared. “I looked for him for two days… My child is mentally challenged… he wouldn’t have been able to find his way back home,” the mother said.\nDCP (Outer North) Nidhin Valsan said, “At that time, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Balraj had completed all the formalities and looked for the child in nearby police stations, bus terminals, railway stations, hospitals and shelter homes… but he could not be found.”\nRecently, when the police revisited unsolved cases, especially those of missing and kidnapped children, this particular case seemed to stick out.\nStation House Officer of Narela Industrial Area police station, Manoj Kumar, reinstated ASI Balraj to the case.\n“We had no CCTV footage from the time he went missing… The last time, we couldn’t find him in any shelter home in Delhi. Almost on a whim, we started looking at shelter homes in Ghaziabad and other nearby areas across the border… We finally found him under the care of a specialised adoption agency in Gharonda,” said an officer.\nWhen the police asked the boy how he managed to come to Ghaziabad on his own, he said that he wanted to travel on a bus. “So, he got on one and came all the way to Anand Vihar. He realised he was in trouble only once he got off the bus and did not know how to go home,” the officer said.\nMeanwhile, after 21 months, the boy’s mother had given up any hope of finding him alive. “I thought someone might have kidnapped him and sold him… sometimes I would think maybe someone killed him and dumped his body somewhere. Eventually, I stopped waiting for any news from the police,” the 30-year-old said.\nSo when the police called her on December 3, asking her to come to Ghaziabad and identify her son, she did not believe them. “I thought it was a cruel joke they were playing on me. I thought my son was dead, so I thought they had found another boy,” she said.\n“She needed a bit of convincing to come to Ghaziabad,” said the officer, chuckling. “But the moment the boy saw her, he immediately ran to her,” he said.\nWhile looking at the Aadhaar card details of the boy and his parents, the police realised that December 3 was also the boy’s 10th birthday. “We got a cake immediately and held a cake-cutting ceremony,” the officer said. Back home, the family celebrated with a lavish dinner.\nThe mother has now set down some stern rules, never to be broken. “He can’t leave my eyesight. I make him stay home and read books. He can play as much as he wants, but only inside the house,” she said.\nTop Stories\nMust Read\nBuzzing Now\n[Dec 05: Latest News](/latest-news/)\n- 01\n- 02\n- 03\n- 04\n- 05",
