    "text": "Charlie’s First Alert Forecast: Saturday and Sunday staying sunny and breezy Calm conditions and seasonable temperatures begins 2024 GREENVILLE, N.C. (WITN) - The winds will pick back up again Saturday afternoon, this time forcing temperatures down into the upper 40s as cold air moves in from the west. The cold air won’t stick around long, leaving the East by Sunday and Monday, pushing our temps back towards our seasonal norms in the mid 50s. However, another cold air mass will arrive Monday night into Tuesday. With moisture present just ahead of the cold air, the slim chance of sleet early Tuesday morning has melted away. Ground temperatures will stay well above freezing, so the threat of any frozen drops reaching the ground is nil. Wednesday will be sunny and mild before another storm system moves in the area Thursday. This is looking to be more of a rain maker than wintry event, as air temperatures will be above freezing. A few sleet pellets might be possible, but that will be very slim to none with this system.

    "text": "Salerno.\n\"C'è chi riesce ad andarsene e chi, pur avendo tutte le carte in regola, rimane bloccato. È quanto sta accadendo all'interno dell’Azienda ospedaliera universitaria \"Ruggi\" di Salerno, dove alcuni infermieri in attesa di mobilità volontaria si ritrovano inspiegabilmente fermi al palo\".\nSecondo quanto segnalato dalla Fials di Salerno, la situazione appare sempre più confusa e priva di trasparenza: da un lato ci sono dipendenti che hanno ottenuto il nullaosta e sono già stati trasferiti; dall’altro, colleghi con gli stessi requisiti - e con i dovuti via libera dai loro responsabili - si vedono negare il trasferimento senza alcuna motivazione ufficiale.\n“Non è possibile assistere a una gestione così arbitraria - denuncia Carlo Lopopolo, segretario generale della Fials Salerno -. Abbiamo casi di infermieri bloccati nonostante la richiesta ufficiale dell’Asl, e altri a cui è stato detto all’ultimo minuto che la procedura non può proseguire per mancanza di graduatorie. Eppure lo stesso \"Ruggi\" ha recentemente assunto nuovo personale proprio da quelle graduatorie. Come si spiega questo doppio binario?”\nLa Fials salernitana denuncia anche la mancanza di comunicazione da parte della direzione aziendale. “Abbiamo chiesto un incontro ufficiale con il direttore generale - prosegue Lopopolo - ma dopo sette giorni nessuno ci ha risposto. Questo silenzio è grave. Se entro una settimana non arriveranno risposte concrete, saremo costretti a scendere in piazza con una manifestazione e a presentare pubblicamente tutta la documentazione che dimostra quanto sta accadendo”.\nLa Fials Salerno chiede chiarezza, rispetto delle regole e delle persone, e l’immediato rilascio del nullaosta a chi ne ha diritto. “Non stiamo chiedendo favori - conclude Lopopolo - stiamo solo pretendendo che vengano rispettati i diritti dei lavoratori e il principio fondamentale delle pari opportunità”.",

    "text": "(Reuters) -All 31 workers escaped without injuries from a collapsed industrial tunnel in Los Angeles' Wilmington area, after scrambling over a tall pile of loose underground soil, city officials said late on Wednesday.\nThe trapped workers were shuttled back to the tunnel's entry point, more than 5 miles (8 km) away from the affected area, after they escaped the collapsed section and met several coworkers in the unaffected part of the tunnel, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement.\nThe tunnel, which had a diameter of 18 ft (5.5 m), trapped 27 individuals, while four workers entered the damaged section to assist with rescue, LA Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva told reporters in a media briefing.\n\"The workers had to climb through debris. They had to make themselves out through,\" before they were assisted out, Villanueva said.\nRobert Ferrante, chief engineer and general manager of Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, told the briefing that a section of the already built part of the tunnel experienced squeezing ground conditions and partially collapsed.\n\"LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for. I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X.\nThe collapsed section was a part of the Los Angeles County's Clearwater Project, where the new 7-mile tunnel is being built to upgrade the region's sewer system, officials added.\n(Reporting by Gnaneshwar Rajan and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Surbhi Misra; Editing by Jacqueline Wong, Kim Coghill, Jamie Freed and Tomasz Janowski)\nBy Gnaneshwar Rajan and Shubham Kalia\nShare © Reuters - 2025",

    "text": "Christian Community Attacked in Pakistan; Blasphemy Accusation Sparks Violence At least five members of a minority Christian community in eastern Pakistan were rescued after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement. The crowd accused the Christians of blasphemy, leading to violence including the burning of houses and looting. The incident highlights the misuse of blasphemy laws in Pakistan. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 25-05-2024 17:43 IST | Created: 25-05-2024 17:43 IST At least five members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said. The crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district. A large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, he said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back and five injured Christians had been taken to hospital. At least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader. \"They burned one house and lynched several Christians,\" Bhatti aid. Videos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street. Bhatti said the videos were images from the scene. Reuters could not independently verify the pictures. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs\". Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores. While blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs. A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.
