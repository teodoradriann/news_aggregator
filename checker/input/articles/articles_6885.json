    "text": "转自：中国环境报\n利用私设的暗管，绕过自动监测设备排放水污染物的行为应如何认定及处罚，一直困扰着环境执法甚至环境司法人员。\n《水污染防治法》（2017年修正）第三十九条规定，禁止利用渗井、渗坑、裂隙、溶洞，私设暗管，篡改、伪造监测数据，或者不正常运行水污染防治设施等逃避监管的方式排放水污染物。第八十三条规定，违反本法规定，有下列行为之一的，由县级以上人民政府环境保护主管部门责令改正或者责令限制生产、停产整治，并处十万元以上一百万元以下的罚款；情节严重的，报经有批准权的人民政府批准，责令停业、关闭：\n（一）未依法取得排污许可证排放水污染物的；\n（二）超过水污染物排放标准或者超过重点水污染物排放总量控制指标排放水污染物的；\n（三）利用渗井、渗坑、裂隙、溶洞，私设暗管，篡改、伪造监测数据，或者不正常运行水污染防治设施等逃避监管的方式排放水污染物的；\n（四）未按照规定进行预处理，向污水集中处理设施排放不符合处理工艺要求的工业废水的。\n通过私自设置的隐蔽管道绕过自动监测设备排放水污染物的行为，在事实上构成单一行为。然而，该行为同时触犯了多项法律规范，类似于刑法理论中所指的想象竞合。行为人仅实施了一次行为，而作为评价基础的也是这一单一行为。现行的行政及生态环境法律法规并未明确规定想象竞合的问题，我国刑法总则亦未明确阐述想象竞合犯及其处理原则。尽管如此，刑法分则的某些条款显然认可了想象竞合犯的存在，并规定对想象竞合犯仅适用较重的法定刑。\n首先，探讨“未经规范排放污染物，规避监控”的行为是否构成篡改数据。《环境保护法》明确禁止篡改、伪造监测数据，并规定了相应的法律责任。配套办法之一的《行政主管部门移送适用行政拘留环境违法案件暂行办法》详细列出了逃避监管的违法排放行为，但未明确包括未经规范排放的行为。而《环境监测数据弄虚作假行为判定及处理办法》则将“稀释排放、旁路排放或未经规范排放”等行为视为篡改监测数据，并针对生态环境监测机构的弄虚作假行为进行了规定。\n根据《污染源自动监控设施现场监督检查办法》（2012年施行），排污或运营单位若规避监控设施排放污染物，将依据《水污染防治法》第七十条或《大气污染防治法》第四十六条第（二）项受罚。《水污染防治法》2017年修正后，罚款提高至二万元以上二十万元以下；《大气污染防治法》2015年修订后，罚款同样提高至二万元以上二十万元以下，并规定构成违反治安管理行为的，由公安机关处罚。\n依据《环境保护法》第六十三条规定，企业事业单位和其他生产经营者有下列行为之一，尚不构成犯罪的，除依照有关法律法规规定予以处罚外，由县级以上人民政府环境保护主管部门或者其他有关部门将案件移送公安机关，对其直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员，处十日以上十五日以下拘留；情节较轻的，处五日以上十日以下拘留：\n（一）建设项目未依法进行环境影响评价，被责令停止建设，拒不执行的；\n（二）违反法律规定，未取得排污许可证排放污染物，被责令停止排污，拒不执行的；\n（三）通过暗管、渗井、渗坑、灌注或者篡改、伪造监测数据，或者不正常运行防治污染设施等逃避监管的方式违法排放污染物的；\n（四）生产、使用国家明令禁止生产、使用的农药，被责令改正，拒不改正的。\n由此可见，利用私设的暗管排放水污染物的行为，相较于“将部分或者全部污染物不经规范的排放口排放，从而规避污染源自动监控设施监控”的行为，法律规定的行政处罚更为严厉。\n因此，利用私设的暗管，绕过自动监测设备排放水污染物的行为，应仅认定为单一违法行为，即利用私设暗管排放水污染物的违法行为。并依照处罚较重规定进行处罚，即依据《水污染防治法》第八十三条第（三）项和《环境保护法》第六十三条第（三）项的规定进行处罚。\n（作者系河北环境工程学院教授、武汉大学环境法研究所研究员）\nVIP课程推荐\nAPP专享直播\n热门推荐\n收起24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance）",

    "title": "Mysterious morel mushrooms at center of food poisoning outbreak",
    "text": "A food poisoning outbreak that killed two people and sickened 51, stemming from a Montana restaurant, has highlighted just how little is known about morel mushrooms and the risks in preparing the popular and expensive delicacy.\nThe FDA conducted an investigation into morel mushrooms after the severe illness outbreak linked to Dave’s Sushi in Bozeman in late March and April. The investigation found that undercooked or raw morels were the likely culprit, and it led the agency to issue its first guidelines on preparing morels.\n“The toxins in morel mushrooms that may cause illness are not fully understood; however, using proper preparation procedures, such as cooking, can help to reduce toxin levels,” according to the FDA guidance.\nEven then, a risk remains, according to the FDA: “Properly preparing and cooking morel mushrooms can reduce risk of illness, however there is no guarantee of safety even if cooking steps are taken prior to consumption.”\nPeople are also reading…\nJon Ebelt, spokesperson for Montana’s health department, said there is limited public health information or medical literature on morels. And samples of the morels taken from Dave’s Sushi detected no specific toxin, pathogen, pesticide, or volatile or nonvolatile organic compound in the mushrooms.\nAaron Parker, the owner of Dave’s Sushi, said morels are a “boutique item.” In season, generally during the spring and fall, morels can cost him $40 per pound, while morels purchased out of season are close to $80 per pound, he said.\nMany highly regarded recipe books describe sauteing morels to preserve the sought-after, earthy flavor. At Dave’s, a marinade, sometimes boiling, was poured over the raw mushrooms before they were served, Parker said. After his own investigation, Parker said he found boiling them between 10 and 30 minutes is the safest way to prepare morel mushrooms.\nParker said he reached out to chefs across the country and found that many, like him, were surprised to learn about the toxicity of morels.\n“They had no idea that morel mushrooms had this sort of inherent risk factor regardless of preparation,” Parker said.\nAccording to the FDA’s Food Code, the vast majority of the more than 5,000 fleshy mushroom species that grow naturally in North America have not been tested for toxicity. Of those that have, 15 species are deadly, 60 are toxic whether raw or cooked — including “false” morels, which look like spongy edible morels — and at least 40 are poisonous if eaten raw, but safer when cooked.\nThe North American Mycological Association, a national nonprofit whose members are mushroom experts, recorded 1,641 cases of mushroom poisonings and 17 deaths from 1985 to 2006. One hundred and twenty-nine of those poisonings were attributed to morels, but no deaths were reported.\nMarian Maxwell, the outreach chairperson for the Puget Sound Mycological Society, based in Seattle, said cooking breaks down the chitin in mushrooms, the same compound found in the exoskeletons of shellfish, and helps destroy toxins. Maxwell said morels may naturally contain a type of hydrazine — a chemical often used in pesticides or rocket fuel that can cause cancer— which can affect people differently. Cooking does boil off the hydrazine, she said, “but some people still have reactions even though it’s cooked and most of that hydrazine is gone.”\nHeather Hallen-Adams, chair of the toxicology committee of the North American Mycological Association, said hydrazine has been shown to exist in false morels, but it’s not as “clear-cut” in true morels, which were the mushrooms used at Dave’s Sushi.\nMushroom-caused food poisonings in restaurant settings are rare — the Montana outbreak is believed to be one of the first in the U.S. related to morels — but they have happened infrequently abroad. In 2019, a morel food poisoning outbreak at a Michelin-star-rated restaurant in Spain sickened about 30 customers. One woman who ate the morels died, but her death was determined to be from natural causes. Raw morels were served on a pasta salad in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2019 and poisoned 77 consumers, though none died.\nBefore the new guidelines were issued, the FDA’s Food Code guidance to states was only that serving wild mushrooms must be approved by a “regulatory authority.”\nThe FDA’s Food Code bans the sale of wild-picked mushrooms in a restaurant or other food establishment unless it’s been approved to do so, though cultivated wild mushrooms can be sold if the cultivation operations are overseen by a regulatory agency, as was the case with the morels at Dave’s Sushi. States’ regulations vary, according to a 2021 study by the Georgia Department of Public Health and included in the Association of Food and Drug Officials’ regulatory guidelines. For example, Montana and a half-dozen other states allow restaurants to sell wild mushrooms if they come from a licensed seller, according to the study. Seventeen other states allow the sale of wild mushrooms that have been identified by a state-credentialed expert.\nThe study found that the varied resources states use to identify safe wild mushrooms — including mycological associations, academics, and the food service industry — may suggest a need for better communication.\nThe study recognized a “guidance document” as the “single most important step forward” given the variety in regulations and the demand for wild mushrooms.\nHallen-Adams said raw morels are known to be poisonous by “mushroom people,” but that’s not common knowledge among chefs.\nIn the Dave’s Sushi case, Hallen-Adams said, it was obvious that safety information didn’t get to the people who needed it. “And this could be something that could be addressed by labeling,” she said.\nThere hasn’t been much emphasis placed on making sure consumers know how to properly prepare the mushrooms, Hallen-Adams said, “and that’s something we need to start doing.”",

    "title": "Palantir Stock Spikes 6% on U.S. Army TITAN Contract | FinancialContent Business Page",
    "text": "The share price of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) was sharply higher in pre-market trading on March 6, 2024. The company announced it has been awarded a two-year $178 million contract from the U.S. Army for its Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) program. These are mobile ground stations that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology.\nThe TITAN system's mission is to provide real-time actionable intelligence using AI and ML modeling that can be implemented at the tactical edge. Palantir's AIP platform will provide a best-in-class solution that will lay the foundation for a scalable, adaptable solution designed for a rapidly evolving threat environment.\nWhy Did the Army Choose Palantir? According to Akash Jain, president, Palantir USG, \"This award demonstrates the Army's leadership in acquiring and fielding the emerging technologies needed to bolster U.S. defense in this era of software-defined warfare... Soldiers deserve best-in-class technology that gives them the tactical advantage on the battlefield, allowing for real-time decisions at critical speeds. Palantir is honored to support this program, to continue its partnership with the Army, and to lead a team of innovative partners to build the next generation of capabilities.\"\nPutting the Deal in Perspective In 2023, Palantir generated just over $2.25 billion in revenue. When fully paid out, this contract represents about 14% of that total. It's a nice start to the year, considering that the company reported 18% sales growth for all of last year. The contract is also a key next step in Palantir's objective to be a dominant military contractor.\nHowever, it's important to note that even with the $89 million from this contract, Palantir's projected full-year 2024 revenue of between $2.65 billion and $2.67 billion would still be short of analysts' projections of $2.8 billion.\nThat will give the naysayers ( of which there are many ) something to argue against. One criticism of Palantir from its origins has been that it is overvalued among defense stocks and will need growth from the commercial side of its business to justify its current premium. However, Palantir doesn't fit neatly into the category of defense stocks or artificial intelligence stocks . It's not one of many; it's the only company that does precisely what it does.\nTo illustrate that, you should consider that the TITAN contract wasn't the only piece of news Palantir recently reported.\nPalantir Plans to Demonstrate Why Seeing is Believing On Thursday, March 7, Palantir will host AIPCon , where more than 60 customers will showcase the work they've been able to accomplish with Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). At the event, which will also be live-streamed on YouTube, Palantir plans to announce over 20 new customers and partners that cut across many different sectors.\nPalantir Remains a Stock That Requires Conviction All of this news takes place two months before Palantir reports earnings in May. That will give analysts ample time to consider their outlook for PLTR stock. As Thomas Hughes recently wrote for MarketBeat, analysts' ratings must be taken with a grain of salt as they raise their price targets while maintaining an overall \"Reduce\" rating on the stock. Plus, institutional investors continue to buy the stock.",

    "text": "Israeli military vehicles are lined up on a beach, amid the ongoing ground operation of the Israeli army against Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in the Gaza Strip as seen in a handout picture released by the Israel Defense Forces on November 13, 2023. Israel Defense Forces/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Reuters\nBy Dan Williams\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel is prepared to let ships deliver aid to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip \"immediately\" as part of a proposed sea corridor from Cyprus, the Israeli foreign minister said on Sunday, naming four European countries as potential participants.\nUnder the arrangement first suggested by Nicosia in November, cargo would undergo security inspection in the Cypriot port of Larnaca before being ferried to the Gaza coast, 370 km (230 miles) away, rather than through neighbouring Egypt or Israel.\nIf the plan goes ahead, it would mark the first easing of an Israeli naval blockade imposed on Gaza in 2007 after militant Hamas Islamists seized control of the Palestinian enclave.\nIsrael has described the corridor as a means of ending its civilian ties to Gaza, where it has been waging an 12-week-old offensive in retaliation for a cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by Hamas gunmen.\nRelated:\nA Timeline of the Israel-Palestinian Conflict With hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians displaced, the idea may also go some way toward meeting a U.N. Security Council resolution of Dec. 22 calling for expanded humanitarian relief mechanisms.\n\"It can start immediately,\" Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM when asked about the Mediterranean corridor.\nHe said Britain, France, Greece and the Netherlands were among countries with vessels able to land directly on the shores of Gaza, which lacks a deep-water port. He appeared to suggest he expected them to do that rather than offload aid in Israel.\n\"They requested of us that the equipment come via (the Israeli port of) Ashdod. The answer is no. It won't come via Ashdod. It won't come via Israel. We want disengagement, with security control. That's the goal of this process,\" Cohen said.\nThere was no immediate response from London, Paris, Athens or Amsterdam.\nBritain and Greece have previously expressed support for the Cypriot initiative, with Britain offering shallow-bottomed vessels to approach the Gaza coast, a senior Cypriot official told Reuters.\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has also backed the Cypriot plan, which would involve Israeli security agents taking part in the Larnaca inspections.\n\"As of now there is a maritime blockade, and if such an (aid) ship comes from Larnaca, it will be with our approval,\" Cohen said. \"It will of course be a secured corridor, as we have no intention of endangering a British or French ship coming in coordination with us.\"\nSeveral European and Arab donor countries have been sending aid to Gaza through the nearby Egyptian coastal town of Al Arish. Israel has been involved in monitoring those shipments, in what some humanitarian relief agencies say creates lags.\nCairo tracks traffic across its Gaza border and has ruled out any influx of Palestinian refugees. On Saturday, Israel signalled it would seize control of the Gaza-Egypt border zone as part of its efforts to demilitarise the enclave.\n(Additional reporting by Michele Kambas; Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Andrew Heavens)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Greece , United Nations , France , Israel , European Union , Middle East , United Kingdom , Europe , Egypt , Cyprus , Netherlands\nRead More",

    "text": "Learn how the Polycam team has made 3D Gaussian Splatting easily accessible to both desktop and mobile users.\nThroughout the past several months, a new ML-powered rendering method called 3D Gaussian Splatting has been gaining widespread attention on the internet.\nFor those unaware, Gaussian Splatting is a real-time 3D reconstruction and rendering method for images taken from multiple viewpoints. As part of this approach, the 3D space is defined by using millions of particles (Gaussians), each equipped with attributes such as position, orientation, scale, opacity, and color, while machine learning is employed to calculate the parameters for each Gaussian.\nCompared to other rendering methods, like, for example, photogrammetry, a technique for generating 3D polygons from images from multiple viewpoints, or Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which uses AI to accurately render open scenes and surfaces with reflections or translucent surfaces, 3D Gaussian Splatting requires much less computing power to render a scene in real-time.\nThis distinction is due to the fact that, although machine learning is necessary for training the Gaussian parameters, the rendering process itself is lightweight and can be executed in real-time without the need for intensive processing.\nvia its websiteand on mobile through its app.\nWith Polycam's solution, users have the ability to capture a minimum of 20 images, up to 1000 images, for direct processing within the app. Furthermore, Polycam's website enables the upload of both images and video files. Here's a visual display from Polycam's website that shows the creation process of a Gaussian Splat:\nWith Polycam's solution, you can seamlessly harness the power of Gaussian Splats to capture intricate environmental details, a task that might be challenging with traditional photogrammetry, especially when dealing with elements like reflections or water. Polycam also offers users the capability to repurpose the raw images from their initial 3D captures, reprocessing them as Gaussian Splats.\nGaussian Splats can be exported from Polycam as PLY files and seamlessly integrated into various 3D software platforms, with ready-made plug-ins for Blender, Unreal Engine, and Unity already in place.\nFurthermore, Polycam offers a Splat viewer on their website, allowing users to easily drag and drop their self-trained Gaussian Splat files, whether created within or outside of the Polycam environment.\nBelow is a series of examples from Polycam Gaussian Splats users, who leveraged the solution to capture landscapes, buildings, objects, people, and more:\nYou can learn more and get started with Polycam's Gaussian Splatting solution by clicking\nthis link.

    "text": "El epazote, una hierba tradicionalmente usada en América Latina y muy popular en México, destaca por sus propiedades antiparasitarias, que la convierten en una excelente opción natural para combatir infecciones intestinales. Su nombre proviene del náhuatl epazotl, que significa “hierba con olor fuerte”, y aunque su sabor es intenso, sus beneficios medicinales son aún más notables. La planta contiene compuestos activos como el ascaridol y el limoneno, responsables de sus efectos antiinflamatorios, digestivos y antiparasitarios, lo que la convierte en un recurso eficaz y natural para tratar infecciones por parásitos. (Le puede interesar: Científicos investigan por qué glaciar clave de la Antártida está 'desprendiendo humo': imágenes satelitales prenden las alertas). El epazote se ha usado tradicionalmente como antihelmíntico, es decir, como remedio contra parásitos intestinales. Gracias a su contenido de ascaridol, un compuesto químico de propiedades antiparasitarias, esta planta ayuda a eliminar los parásitos y a evitar su proliferación en el sistema digestivo, según la Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural. Históricamente, se ha empleado en la medicina tradicional para expulsar estos organismos y aliviar los malestares que provocan, como los cólicos y la inflamación. Además de su capacidad antiparasitaria, el epazote es conocido por su efecto calmante y digestivo. Esta hierba tiene propiedades carminativas, lo que significa que ayuda a reducir la formación de gases en el intestino y facilita la digestión. Su efecto calmante también lo hace útil para el alivio de dolores estomacales y cólicos menstruales, y sus componentes naturales pueden ayudar a relajar el sistema nervioso, reduciendo la ansiedad y el nerviosismo. (Lea también: Los turistas cada vez están más interesados en conocer pueblos colombianos: tres opciones populares por su historia). El epazote se puede añadir a una variedad de platillos, principalmente guisos, sopas y frijoles, donde es comúnmente utilizado en la cocina mexicana para mejorar la digestión de estos alimentos. Sin embargo, dado que su sabor es fuerte y puede dominar los demás ingredientes, es recomendable añadirlo al final de la preparación, lo que también permite conservar mejor sus propiedades medicinales. En frijoles de olla, por ejemplo, unas pocas hojas de epazote pueden marcar la diferencia tanto en sabor como en digestión. El epazote, como cualquier planta medicinal, debe usarse con moderación. Aunque es muy eficaz en sus efectos, el consumo excesivo puede causar malestar. La cantidad recomendada varía según el organismo, pero en general, basta con agregar una pequeña cantidad a las comidas o preparar una infusión suave. GDA EL UNIVERSAL MÉXICO",
