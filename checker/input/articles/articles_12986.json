    "title": "Nikki Haley expands on Civil War comment after she did not cite slavery as a cause for the war",
    "text": "The questioner told Haley it was \"astonishing\" she gave an answer that did not mention slavery.\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Thursday addressed the backlash to her\n[Wednesday night comments](/nikki-haley-doesnt-cite-slavery-as-civil-war-cause-after-question-/14233575/) about what she thought was the cause of the American Civil War, during which she notably did not cite slavery as a cause, sparking criticism.\n\"Of course, the Civil War was about slavery,\" said Haley at a Thursday town hall in New Hampshire. \"We know that. That's unquestioned. Always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery.\"\nHaley continued to elaborate, telling the crowd that the war was about more than that.\n\"It was about the freedoms of every individual,\" she said. \"It was about the role of the government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing and whether government economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more. But the lessons of what the bigger issue with the Civil War is that let's not forget what came out of that, which is government's role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone in government getting in our way.\"\nHaley said that she believes everyone deserves to be a free individual\nHer comments were prompted by an\n[audience question](nikki-haley-doesnt-cite-slavery-as-civil-war-cause-after-question-/14233575/) about what Haley thought the war was about.\nThe Republican candidate first turned the question around on the person who posed it.\n\"What do you think the cause of the Civil War was?\" she asked, to which the questioner responded by saying, \"I'm not running for president.\"\nHaley then stated: \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are. And we will always stand by the fact that I think the government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people,\" Haley said. \"It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need to tell you how to live your life. They don't need to tell you what you can and can't do. They don't need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom.\"\nThe questioner told Haley it was \"astonishing\" she gave an answer that did not mention slavery.\n\"What do you want me to say about slavery?\" she responded before pivoting and asking for the next question.\nIn a radio interview with The Pulse of NH on Thursday, she claimed the questioner was \"definitely a Democrat plant.\"\n\"That's why I said: 'What does it mean to you?' And if you notice, he didn't answer anything,\" she said.\nCritics accused Haley of refusing to mention slavery, saying her description of the Civil War is whitewashing U.S. history.\n\"Haley's refusal to admit that the Civil War was rooted in slavery last night in Berlin is just the latest of her shameful attempts to whitewash our country's history,\" said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley. \"From defending the Confederate flag and leaders to equating Black History Month with Confederate History Month, Haley's record bowing to the extreme fringes of the MAGA base speaks volumes and is yet another reason why New Hampshire voters will reject her next year.\"\nPresident Joe Biden responded to Haley's comments on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating simply: \"It was about slavery.\"\nA senior Biden adviser expanded on the comment to ABC News.\n\"It doesn't take a PhD to understand that slavery was the central cause of the civil war, but instead of telling it like it is, the entire MAGA field from Donald Trump on down are pandering to the most extreme fringe of their base. Minimize slavery, paraphrase HITLER, punish women and doctors - quite the record heading into the general election that will be the most diverse in history,\" the adviser said.\nAs a former South Carolina governor, Haley has long been under scrutiny for her views of the Confederacy's place in American history.\nOn the campaign trail, she has repeatedly invoked the memory of her 2015 calls for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds. The call followed a racially motivated mass shooting at a Charleston church that left nine Black people dead.\n\"For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble: traditions of history, of heritage, of ancestry,\" said Haley in a speech calling for its removal. She later continued, \"At the same time, for many others in South Carolina, the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.\"",

    "text": "The highest temperatures recorded on March 20 were 40.8 degrees Celsius (°C) in Tây Ninh Province; 40.2°C in Bình Phước Province; 39.3°C in Thủ Dầu Một city, Bình Dương Province; 37.8°C in Biên Hòa District, Đồng Nai Province; and 37.4°C in HCM City.\nFrom the beginning of the year, the most recent hottest weather recorded in the Southern region was on March 11, with temperatures of 38.5°C in Bình Phước Province, 37°C in HCM City, and 37-38°C in many places.\nAccording to meteorological experts, temperatures in the southern region, including HCM City, will hit 38- 39 degrees Celsius and even higher from March 25 to 28.\nThere will be isolated rain from March 29 to April 2 and then the heatwave will return.\nThe region is expected to face a longer and more intense heat wave this year due to the impact of El Nino phenomenon growing in strength.\nAccording to medical experts, prolonged heat is conducive to the spread of bacteria and viruses, and could cause seniors to get sore throat, sinusitis and laryngitis.\nCommon diseases during hot spells include diarrhea, food poisoning and acute respiratory tract inflammation.\nChildren could also contract chicken pox, mumps, measles, and meningitis. Dehydration is also a threat, they warned.\nParents should regularly wash their children’s hands before eating to prevent infection and keep the environment clean, and be hygienic with cooking and storing food.\nKids should be given plenty of water and fruit juices and vaccinated adequately.\nPeople are recommended to limit going out during the hours of 11am-2pm daily during the heatwave to protect their health. — VNS",

    "title": "Les énergies renouvelables reviennent moins cher que le nucléaire : l’étude choc",
    "text": "Câ€™est une recherche passionnante que vient de publier la banque d’investissement amÃ©ricaine Lazard. Dans\nce document de 48 pages, les analystes comparent ainsi le coÃ»t de production dâ€™Ã©lectricitÃ© Ã partir des diffÃ©rentes sources dâ€™Ã©nergie.\nComme chacun des rapports sortis sur le sujet, il risque de faire polÃ©mique et dâ€™Ãªtre contestÃ© par les partisans de lâ€™Ã©nergie nuclÃ©aire. Il nâ€™est nullement question de trancher ce dÃ©bat ici, dâ€™autant que ces derniÃ¨res nous apparaissent complÃ©mentaires.\nLes Ã©nergies renouvelables sont trÃ¨s compÃ©titives\nLazard rapporte donc que lâ€™Ã©olien terrestre sera la forme dâ€™Ã©nergie la moins chÃ¨re avec un coÃ»t moyen de production d’Ã©nergie (LCOE) dans le monde entier compris entre 27 dollars par mÃ©gawattheure et 73 $US/MWh. Si on intÃ¨gre le coÃ»t de stockage, on passe de 45 dollars Ã 133 dollars par MWh. Ã€ titre de comparaison, câ€™est largement moins cher que le charbon et le gaz Ã cycle combinÃ© : 69-168 $/MWh et 45-108 $/MWh).\nLa tendance est la mÃªme pour lâ€™Ã©nergie solaire dont le LCOE est compris entre 29 dollars et 92 $/MWh. En incluant le stockage, ce niveau varie entre 60 $/MWh et 210 $/MWh. Les experts de la banque dâ€™investissement estiment donc :\n[Les Ã©nergies renouvelables]restent compÃ©titives en termes de coÃ»ts par rapport Ã la production conventionnelle, ce qui conduira Ã la poursuite du remplacement des combustibles fossiles.\nEncore plus surprenant, les analystes constatent que le coÃ»t de production de lâ€™Ã©nergie nuclÃ©aire a doublÃ© en treize ans. Il est passÃ© de 95 dollars /MWh en 2011 Ã 182 dollars cette annÃ©e. De fait, il semble toutefois peu pertinent dâ€™opposer les deux.\nLe nuclÃ©aire offre en effet une source dâ€™Ã©lectricitÃ© qui fonctionne sans interruption, tandis que les Ã©nergies renouvelables sont par dÃ©finition intermittentes. La France semble dâ€™ailleurs sâ€™orienter vers un mix Ã©nergÃ©tique qui inclut ces deux sources, mÃªme si certaines familles politiques penchent plus volontiers vers lâ€™une ou lâ€™autre.\nLe potentiel inexploitÃ© de lâ€™Ã©nergie solaire\nQuoi quâ€™il en soit, ces rÃ©sultats ne sont finalement pas de nature Ã nous surprendre. Nous vous parlions dâ€™ailleurs rÃ©cemment de cette recherche rÃ©alisÃ©e par des chercheurs de lâ€™Institut de technologie de Karlsruhe, en Allemagne.\nDâ€™aprÃ¨s ces derniers, 50 % des 41 millions de maisons individuelles dâ€™Europe auraient pu Ãªtre autosuffisantes en matiÃ¨re Ã©nergÃ©tique si elles avaient Ã©tÃ© dotÃ©es de panneaux photovoltaÃ¯ques sur leurs toits et de batteries en 2020. Ce niveau pourrait mÃªme monter jusquâ€™Ã 75 % dâ€™ici 2050, estiment les auteurs.
