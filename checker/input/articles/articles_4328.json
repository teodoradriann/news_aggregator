    "text": "GGF FOOTBALL THIS WEEK: East Grand Forks ready for test against Little Falls Newly No. 1 Grand Forks Red River has a bye week while Central plays at Bismarck St. Mary's GRAND FORKS — A frustrating theme for the East Grand Forks Senior High football program a season ago was a string of one-score losses. As the 2024 Green Wave look to flip some of those results, one of those opportunities sits a three-and-a-half hour bus ride away this Friday. East Grand Forks travels to Little Falls for a 6 p.m. Week 2 matchup. ADVERTISEMENT The Flyers beat the Green Wave 15-14 in East Grand Forks last season after the Wave missed a late game-winning field goal. How can East Grand Forks flip some of those one-score results from a year ago? \"I think a lot of it is in practice, talking about those things,\" Wave coach Ryan Kasowski said. \"Telling the guys, hey, we're close. What is going to get us over the edge? We harp on those things and make sure we continue to get better every day we come here.\" The Wave opened a promising 2024 last week with a 41-8 win over Crookston in which East Grand Forks led 27-0 after the first quarter and let off the gas. Jakob Stassen, taking over at starting quarterback for three-year starter Drew Carpenter, was 3-for-4 for 81 yards in his debut with an interception. \"I'm very encouraged with Jake,\" Kasowski said. \"The team believes in him, and he can make plays. He threw an interception he'd like to take back. But he does a great job learning and understanding from his mistakes.\" The Wave also saw big plays from skill players in 2024 elevated roles in Jordan Nowacki, Austin Rusling and Cole Schmiedeberg. ADVERTISEMENT Three of Nowacki's four touches against Crookston went for touchdowns. \"It's exciting,\" Kasowski said. \"I think we have multiple guys we can get it to back there. (Nowacki and Schmiedeberg) have explosiveness and hard-nose running. Every time they touch it, they can score. As the season goes on, we hope we can get even more guys carries. It makes your offense more dynamic that way.\" Little Falls lost 36-30 to Pierz in Week 1. The Flyers return a talented quarterback in left-hander Gavin Anderson, who threw for 98 yards against EGF last season. He had 155 yards in Week 1. Trent Roden and Joey Welinkski were Little Falls' top skill players in Week 1. The Flyers' dynamic receiver of 2023, Isaac Olson, is now a freshman on the Northern Michigan football team. Mahnomen-Waubun at Polk County West Polk County West doesn't have it easy as the Thunder hope to bounce back from a season-opening loss. PCW, who lost 38-12 at West Central in Week 1, face annual power Mahnomen-Waubun at 7 p.m. Friday in Climax. Mahnomen-Waubun opened the year with a 41-6 victory against Benson. ADVERTISEMENT \"They're the No. 1 team until someone proves different,\" PCW coach Darrin Byklum said. \"We'll have to come ready to roll. The boys usually step up to this challenge. We'll see what kind of growth we have.\" Byklum said his team struggled early before settling in last week. \"We spotted them three touchdowns,\" he said. \"Once we got things straightened out, it wasn't a perfect game, but at least it was a game. We have to play a full four quarters.\" The Thunder were paced last week by senior running back Sawyer Horken, who had eight carries for 44 yards and a touchdown, along with three catches for 60 yards and a score. Quarterback Will Zavarol was 5-for-7 for 87 yards and a touchdown. Mahnomen-Waubun was a balanced, methodical rushing attack in its approach in Week 1. Quarterback Blake McMullen threw for just 11 yards but ran for three touchdowns and 56 yards on eight carries. Mahnomen-Waubun ran for 278 yards at nearly 6.0 yards per carry. ADVERTISEMENT GF Central at Bismarck St. Mary's As Grand Forks Central works through replacing much of the program's now-graduated offensive production from 2023, Knights coach Jake Schauer is hoping to diversify his options entering this Friday's 7 p.m. kickoff at Bismarck St. Mary's. Central lost 34-9 to Jamestown in its season opener with Naz Fisher (10 carries, 66 yards), Logan Vorhies (3 catches, 38 yards) and Noah Lease (49 yards passing) leading the charge. \"I consider Jamestown a Top 3 team, and they're always in the playoffs,\" Schauer said of Week 1 impressions. \"It's a really good measuring stick. When we were up 9-7, I was really optimistic. I thought, this team could have the grit to hang around. Well, the wheels fell off and it showed our youth. We have more kids out for Central football but only six seniors. At the end of the day, I was still encouraged. The guys will learn how to play. It's on us as coaches to coach them up, then up to them to soak it in. \"I think we have six or seven guys I trust with the ball in their hands. One thing I took away was we had some guys who didn't get the ball enough. We need to diversify. We have receivers like Zade Martin, Brooklan Bruce, Trey Clausen and Kyden Murph. They're capable. It's up to us to scheme things up to get them the ball.\" St. Mary's enters the matchup 0-1 after losing 41-7 to Grand Forks Red River at Cushman Field last Friday. Charles Richter ran for 45 yards and threw for 19 to pace St. Mary's, which is in its first season of Class AA football after playing a Class AAA schedule in previous seasons. GF Red River vs. bye Grand Forks Red River climbed to a No. 1 ranking in Class AA this week, but the Roughriders won't be putting the ranking to any test this weekend.

    "text": "Cannon AFB pediatric brain cancer study findings published Published April 4, 2024 By Capt. Jaclyn Pienkowski 27th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs CANNON AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. -- An occurrence study that assessed the rate of pediatric brain cancer among children of Active-Duty Air Force parents assigned to Cannon AFB between 2010 and 2020 has concluded and a report was published on Feb. 12, 2024. The pediatric brain cancer study was initiated in September 2022 when concerns were brought to Cannon AFB leadership regarding the occurrences of a rare type of pediatric brain cancer called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma/Diffuse Midline Glioma (DIPG/DMG). The concerns suggested that dependents with a history of being assigned to Cannon AFB had a higher occurrence rate of DMG or DIPG. “Your concerns are our concerns,” said Col. Jeremy Bergin, 27th Special Operations Wing commander. “Our number one priority is the health and safety of our Air Commandos and their families, and we take this responsibility seriously. Our hearts continue to be with the families who have lost loved ones to DIPG/DMG cancer or are currently facing childhood cancer of any kind – it is devastating.” As a result of the concerns, the Epidemiology Consult Service at the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) began an assessment of DIPG/DMG occurrences at Cannon AFB in January 2023. This epidemiological study aimed to research the history of DIPG and DMG at Cannon and determine if there is a cluster of pediatric cancer at higher rates than the national average. “An epidemiological study looks at the distribution of diseases and other health-related conditions in a specified population, over a specified period of time,” said Col. Eric Chumbley, chief of aerospace medicine. The study assessed the number of children of Active Duty Air Force parents that were assigned to Cannon AFB during the period of 2010-2020, and compared these numbers to two other populations: other children of Active Duty Air Force parents that have not been assigned to Cannon AFB and the U.S. civilian child population. Given the small number of DIPG/DMG cases, USAFSAM expanded the study to assess the incidence of all pediatric brain cancers in these populations, and not only DIPG or DMG. The study found there was no significant increase in overall brain cancer among the pediatric population whose sponsor was stationed at Cannon AFB when compared to either population from 2011-2020. However, when considering only the rare diagnosis of DIPG/DMG, children with a Cannon AFB affiliation had a higher rate of DIPG/DMG compared to the non-Cannon AFB pediatric population and when compared to the U.S. civilian pediatric population. The number of children that had parents assigned to Cannon AFB with this diagnosis between the years assessed was three. Study officials warn that findings with low counts (e.g., three) are statistically unstable and have low reliability, and make it difficult to rule out chance. This means that despite the observed statistically significant rates of DIPG and DMG, the role of chance cannot be dismissed as an explanation. “When conducting these studies, the National Cancer Institute tells us that having 16 or more cases of the same or similarly caused cancers provides more stable statistics and reliable results,” said Chumbley. “In other words, with fewer than 16 cases, the margin of error is too wide.” Additionally, these results should be interpreted with regards to what is known about the causes of DIPG/DMG. According to leading experts in the field across the nation, there are no known environmental exposures or risk factors linked to DIPG/DMG incidence. Regarding Cannon AFB specifically, there is no data suggesting a relationship between environmental conditions on base to include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and DIPG/DMG rates. Researchers state that no evidence exists that specific inherited genetic mutations contribute to DIPG/DMG. Most DIPG/DMG cases are associated with an epigenetic phenomenon resulting in a histone mutation known as H3K27M. This is a random mutation without any known cause. While ionizing radiation is associated with increased rates of pediatric brain cancer in general, there was no note of excessive ionizing radiation exposure among the cases. New Mexico is not known to have areas with environmental ionizing radiation and has a cancer rate, including pediatric brain cancer, below the national average, according to a representative with the New Mexico Department of Health. The study also compared rates of pediatric brain cancer and DIPG/DMG in the Department of the Air Force (DAF) to civilian rates, and found the DAF pediatric population has a significantly lower rate of pediatric brain cancer overall and the rate of DIPG/DMG is statistically similar. By looking at the bigger picture and encompassing a larger population, researchers suggest it provides a more accurate epidemiologic picture. “While the study concluded that the rates of DIPG and DMG at Cannon were likely abnormally high based on chance, it provided Air Force Special Operations Command with recommendations that we plan to implement here at Cannon,” Bergin said. “We will ensure our providers are thoroughly educated on signs and symptoms of pediatric brain cancer; we will actively monitor any cases of pediatric brain cancer and ensure they are referred to the DIPG and DMG international registry; and we will always encourage enrollment of children with these diagnoses into tumor registries and refer them to regional specialist while building knowledge for targeted treatments that could lead to a cure.” The study recently concluded in February 2024 and the findings were published in a report located here.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Noticias\n¿Por qué las cucarachas prefieren el refrigerador?\nMantenimiento adecuado para proteger la comida y la saludLa presencia de cucarachas en el hogar es un problema que muchos enfrentan, incluso cuando se mantiene una limpieza rigurosa. Uno de los lugares más frecuentados por estos insectos es la parte trasera del refrigerador, un electrodoméstico esencial en cualquier casa.\nA diferencia de lo que se cree, la limpieza no siempre es suficiente para alejarlas, ya que las cucarachas pueden sobrevivir en ambientes donde encuentren agua, calor y refugio, incluso sin acceso inmediato a comida. Esto hace que su presencia en las cocinas sea más común de lo que parece y que eliminarlas sea un desafío constante.\nDe acuerdo con el Centro Nacional de Información de Pesticidas de Estados Unidos (NPIC), y Chat GPT, estos insectos buscan refugio en grietas, hendiduras y espacios oscuros, lo que convierte a la nevera en un escondite ideal.\nEl refrigerador no solo proporciona un ambiente cálido en su parte trasera debido al motor y el compresor, sino que también ofrece pequeñas grietas donde pueden resguardarse. Además, la humedad que genera el aparato y las posibles acumulaciones de polvo y residuos de alimentos en su entorno las atraen aún más.\nEl NPIC destaca que las cucarachas son extremadamente resistentes y pueden alimentarse de casi cualquier sustancia, incluso cartón, pegamento y residuos orgánicos microscópicos. Por esta razón, aunque la cocina esté impecable, el simple hecho de que la nevera genere calor y tenga espacios de difícil acceso para la limpieza las convierte en un refugio seguro.\nSi detectas la presencia de cucarachas en la parte trasera de tu refrigerador, es fundamental tomar medidas inmediatas para evitar que la infestación se propague. Aquí algunos pasos clave:\nLimpieza profunda: Desconecta el refrigerador y retira cualquier residuo de polvo y grasa acumulado en la parte posterior. Utiliza una mezcla de agua caliente y detergente para fregar las superficies.\nSellado de grietas: Inspecciona la parte trasera del electrodoméstico y los alrededores en busca de hendiduras o pequeñas aberturas. Usa masilla o sellador de silicona para bloquear estos accesos.\nUso de trampas adhesivas: Coloca trampas cerca de la nevera para detectar actividad y reducir la cantidad de insectos.\nInsecticidas específicos: Si decides utilizar productos químicos, asegúrate de que sean diseñados para cucarachas y sigue las indicaciones de seguridad.\nMantenimiento constante: Mantén el área alrededor de la nevera libre de migajas, restos de comida y humedad para evitar que las cucarachas regresen.\nAsesoría profesional: Si la infestación persiste, consulta con un servicio especializado en control de plagas para una solución definitiva.\nAdemás de controlar la presencia de cucarachas, mantener una nevera limpia es fundamental para prolongar su vida útil y garantizar la seguridad alimentaria. Sigue estos pasos para una limpieza profunda:\nDesconectar y vaciar: Apaga la nevera y retira todos los alimentos. Deshazte de productos en mal estado.\nLavar componentes desmontables: Estantes, cajones y bandejas deben limpiarse con agua y jabón. Puedes sumergirlos en agua con bicarbonato para eliminar olores. Limpiar el interior: Usa una solución de agua y vinagre o bicarbonato de sodio para eliminar residuos y bacterias.\nRevisar el desagüe y el condensador: Un tubo de drenaje obstruido puede generar humedad excesiva, lo que favorece la presencia de plagas.\nSecar y reorganizar: Asegúrate de que todo esté seco antes de volver a colocar los alimentos y encender la nevera.",

    "text": "¡Llega la nieve a México!... Frente Frío y su Masa de Aire Frío azotarán con caída de aguanieve, temperaturas de -10 grados y torbellinos [Carlos Martínez](/autor/-/meta/carlos-martinez) De acuerdo con el pronóstico del SMN, el nuevo frente frío llegará en este primer fin de semana de noviembre El Frente Frío 7 llegará mañana sábado 2 noviembre y según el pronóstico del tiempo elaborado por el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN), se presentará caída de Nieve o Aguanieve, lluvias y un nuevo descenso de temperaturas de hasta los -10 grados. El SMN prevé que el Frente Frío ingresará por el noroeste de México siendo el número 7 de la temporada, el cual estará en asociado a una vaguada en altura y junto con la corriente en chorro polar y su masa de aire frío, las cuales causarán un “descenso de temperatura, rachas fuertes de viento, lluvias y chubascos”. Antes del ingreso del frente frío 7, la onda tropical número 29 y la humedad del Océano Pacífico, dejarán condiciones para que ocurran lluvias en el centro y sur de México, mientras que una nueva onda tropical, que sería la número 30 de la temporada, reforzará las lluvias y descargas eléctricas.

A su vez, una línea seca se establecerá entre Chihuahua y Coahuila, interaccionará con la entrada de aire cálido y húmedo del Golfo de México, ocasionando lluvias fuertes, posible caída de granizo y vientos fuertes con posible formación de torbellinos en Coahuila, Nuevo León y Tamaulipas. La onda tropical 30 se desplazará al sur de Guerrero y Michoacán, aportará humedad incrementando la probabilidad de lluvias puntuales fuertes en Guerrero, así como lluvias y chubascos en el occidente y centro del territorio nacional. Un canal de baja presión se extenderá sobre el oriente y sureste del país, en combinación con inestabilidad en altura, producirá lluvias fuertes a puntuales muy fuertes en ambas regiones, incluida la península de Yucatán, con lluvias puntuales intensas en Chiapas. Finalmente, persistirá el ambiente vespertino caluroso a muy caluroso en las costas del Pacífico central y sur mexicano, con temperaturas máximas de 35 a 40 °C en Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima y Michoacán. Para el sábado, un nuevo frente frío (No. 7) ingresará al noroeste de territorio nacional y recorrerá lentamente el noroeste y norte de México, interaccionará con una vaguada polar y las corrientes en chorro polar y subtropical, incrementando la probabilidad de lluvias y chubascos en la región, así como vientos muy fuertes y descenso de las temperaturas. Además, se prevén condiciones para la caída de nieve y/o aguanieve en la sierra de San Pedro Mártir, B.C., durante el sábado, condiciones que se extenderán a las sierras de Sonora y Chihuahua durante el domingo y primeras horas del día lunes. Canales de baja presión en el interior del territorio nacional aunados a divergencia en altura y a la entrada de humedad de ambos litorales, ocasionarán lluvias y chubascos en el noreste, oriente, occidente, sur y sureste del país, incluido el Valle de México, con lluvias puntuales fuertes a muy fuertes en Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas y Quintana Roo. A su vez, la advección de aire cálido y húmedo del mar Caribe, mantendrá la probabilidad de chubascos en la Península de Yucatán, con lluvias puntuales fuertes en Quintana Roo. Se mantiene en vigilancia una zona de baja presión con potencial ciclónico sobre el suroeste del mar Caribe. PRONÓSTICO DE LLUVIAS Y AGUANIEVE EN EL TERRITORIO MEXICANO Posible caída de nieve o aguanieve: sierras de Baja California, Sonora y Chihuahua.

Un frente frío se produce por el choque de dos masas de aire: una fría y una cálida; esto provoca la formación de tormentas severas y un evento de Norte. Son impulsados por una masa de aire frío a una velocidad aproximada entre 40 y 60 kilómetros/hora, por lo que tienen una duración de 3 a 7 días en nuestro país y dejan un enfriamiento del aire sobre la región por donde pasa. De acuerdo a la climatología de México, la temporada de sistemas frontales inicia durante el mes de septiembre y concluye en mayo cuando se activa la de ciclones y huracanes; además es importante recordar que cuando los frentes interactúan con sistemas tropicales, los vuelven más inestables, duraderos y peligrosos. Los efectos de un frente frío, además de las bajas temperaturas, son lluvias, nevadas, oleaje y viento; este último, cuando corre de norte a sur en el golfo de México e istmo de Tehuantepec, se le conoce comúnmente como Norte.

Ante la llegada de un [frente frío](https://vanguardia.com.mx/topic/-/meta/clima), es importante tomar algunas precauciones para mantenerse seguro y cómodo. Aquí hay algunos pasos que puedes seguir: Viste adecuadamente: Asegúrate de usar ropa abrigada y en capas para mantener el calor. Un abrigo, bufanda, guantes y gorro son esenciales para protegerte del frío. Mantén tu hogar cálido: Si estás en casa, asegúrate de que tu sistema de calefacción esté funcionando correctamente. Si es necesario, utiliza calentadores eléctricos o de gas para mantener el ambiente cálido. Asegúrate también de sellar cualquier filtración de aire en puertas y ventanas. Protégete del viento: El viento puede hacer que la sensación térmica sea mucho más fría. Siempre que salgas, utiliza ropa que te proteja del viento y busca lugares resguardados. Aliméntate bien: Los alimentos calientes pueden ayudarte a mantener tu temperatura corporal. Beber bebidas calientes como té, café o chocolate caliente puede ser reconfortante. Evita actividades al aire libre: Si las condiciones son muy frías, es mejor evitar actividades al aire libre que te expongan demasiado al frío, especialmente si no estás adecuadamente vestido. Conduce con precaución: Las carreteras pueden volverse peligrosas debido al hielo o la nieve. Si necesitas conducir, asegúrate de hacerlo con precaución, reduciendo la velocidad y manteniendo una mayor distancia de seguridad. Protege tus mascotas: Si tienes mascotas, asegúrate de que también estén protegidas del frío. Mantén a los animales en el interior o proporciónales refugio y mantas si están afuera. Prepara suministros: Asegúrate de tener suficientes suministros en caso de que el clima frío cause interrupciones en el suministro de electricidad o agua. Mantén linternas, baterías y alimentos no perecederos a mano. Mantente informado: Sigue los pronósticos meteorológicos para estar al tanto de cualquier cambio en el clima. Esto te permitirá tomar decisiones informadas sobre tus actividades y preparativos. Cuida a las personas vulnerables: Presta atención a niños pequeños, ancianos y personas con problemas de salud, ya que son más susceptibles a las bajas temperaturas. Asegúrate de que estén bien abrigados y protegidos. Recuerda que la clave es mantenerse informado y tomar las precauciones adecuadas para mantener tu seguridad y bienestar durante la llegada de un frente frío.",
