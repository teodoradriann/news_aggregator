    "text": "Nordic Power Prices Surge to 3-Month High Amid Drying Reservoirs and Colder Forecasts\nThe Nordic front-quarter baseload power price has spiked to a three-month high of 23.7 euros/MWh, driven by a perfect storm of drier-than-expected weather, dwindling hydropower reservoirs, and geopolitical grid constraints. This surge, a 14% jump from earlier levels, underscores the region’s vulnerability to climate volatility and its heavy reliance on hydropower—a dependency that could push prices even higher if dry conditions persist.\nThe Reservoir Crisis: A Marginally Full but Fragile System\nNordic hydropower reservoirs, which supply roughly half the region’s electricity, are in a precarious state. While aggregate reservoir levels remain at 70.3% full—14.2% above the 2020–2024 average—the short-term picture is dire. Water reserves available 15 days ahead (PCAEC00) have plummeted from 5.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) above normal to 3.85 TWh above normal in just weeks. This decline reflects a sharp drop in precipitation since late 2024, with Norway’s reservoirs typically hitting their annual minimums in April/May before spring runoff.\nThe drop raises red flags: even a marginal surplus of 3.85 TWh is insufficient to withstand prolonged dryness. With hydropower generation already strained, the region faces a stark choice—rely on costlier thermal plants or brace for further price spikes.\nWeather and the “Dunkelflaute” Threat\nColder-than-expected temperatures and dry conditions are compounding the crisis. European weather models predict below-normal temperatures across Scandinavia through early summer, reducing demand for air conditioning but stifling wind and solar output. The “Dunkelflaute” phenomenon—periods of simultaneous low wind and solar generation—could occur 2–4 times annually by 2025, each lasting up to 48 hours. During these windows, hydropower becomes critical, but dwindling reservoirs may force utilities to burn imported fuels, pushing spot prices even higher.\nIn early 2025, spot prices already spiked 33.4% to 88.95 euros/MWh, reflecting the immediate strain on supply.\nGrid Constraints: The EstLink 2 Outage\nGeopolitical risks amplify the volatility. The EstLink 2 interconnector between Estonia and Finland, which normally allows 350 MW of cross-border power flows, remains offline until August 2025. This outage limits the region’s ability to balance supply across borders, further tightening liquidity in the Nordic market.\nThe Market’s Dual Dynamics\nInvestors face a bifurcated outlook:\n- Short-term volatility: Prices could soar if dry conditions persist, reservoirs dip below critical thresholds, or Dunkelflaute events coincide with grid outages.\n- Longer-term optimism: Forward prices for the front-year contract hit 35.5 euros/MWh, up from early 2025 lows, signaling traders’ belief in sustained supply tightness.\nWinners and Losers in the Energy Shuffle\nThe pain is not evenly distributed. Firms like Orrön Energy, a hydropower producer, saw EBITDA margins shrink as dry weather curtailed output. Meanwhile, thermal generators and grid operators could benefit from higher prices and grid congestion premiums. Investors in spot-market volatility—such as traders betting on price swings—might also profit.\nConclusion: A Tipping Point for Nordic Energy Markets\nThe Nordic power market is at a crossroads. With reservoirs strained, weather forecasts bleak, and grid constraints looming, prices could climb further—potentially testing 2023’s peak of 36.7 euros/MWh for front-year contracts. However, a sudden rainfall or a delayed Dunkelflaute could ease tensions.\nThe key metrics to watch:\n- Hydropower reservoir levels: A drop below 3.0 TWh above normal could trigger panic buying.\n- EstLink 2: Restoration in August might ease grid bottlenecks, but not before summer’s peak demand.\n- Spot prices: If they exceed 90 euros/MWh, it signals a structural imbalance requiring intervention.\nFor now, the data paints a clear picture: Nordic power prices are in a high-risk, high-reward phase. Investors should prepare for turbulence—and perhaps position for a market that could redefine its ceiling in the coming months.",

    "text": "Almost a year after former Cal head coach [Teri McKeever](https://swimswam.com/tag/teri-mckeever/) was [fired for bullying and harassment](https://swimswam.com/cal-fires-teri-mckeever-after-8-month-investigation-into-allegations-of-bullying/), the four-time NCAA champion was suspended Thursday by the U.S. Center for SafeSport for “emotional misconduct.” The conditions of McKeever’s suspension are [listed](https://uscenterforsafesport.org/response-and-resolution/centralized-disciplinary-database/) as “probation, no contact directive(s), education.” The length of the suspension is still unknown as her sanctions do not yet appear on USA Swimming’s website. Allegations about [McKeever’s misconduct first surfaced last May](https://swimswam.com/numerous-cal-swimmers-accuse-coach-teri-mckeever-of-verbal-abuse-for-decades/), as numerous current and former Bears claimed that she had verbally and emotionally abused them. McKeever was then placed on [paid leave by the university](https://swimswam.com/cal-places-teri-mckeever-on-administrative-leave-following-abuse-allegations/), and the school hired an independent law firm to investigate her. Eight months passed before she was finally fired in January. In May, a group of [18 former Cal swimmers sued the University of California regents](https://swimswam.com/former-cal-swimmers-file-lawsuit-against-uc-regents-over-teri-mckeever-abuse/), alleging that officials prioritized athletic success over the well-being of athletes by ignoring McKeever’s bullying — and in certain cases, enabling it — for decades. The suit claimed that athletic director [Jim Knowlton](https://swimswam.com/tag/jim-knowlton/), senior executive associate athletic director Jennifer Simon-O’Neill and other school officials were aware that at that time “several swimmers were leaving the team after experiencing depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations.” Despite this, [McKeever had her contract extended through 2023-24 in January 2020](https://swimswam.com/cal-extends-teri-mckeevers-contract-through-2023-24-season/). From March: [Cal Implementing ‘Additional Steps’ After Firing Teri McKeever](https://swimswam.com/cal-implementing-additional-steps-after-firing-teri-mckeever/) McKeever, 61, served as the Cal women’s head coach from 1993-2022. She led the program to four NCAA titles and six Pac-12 titles while also working on three U.S. Olympic staffs. This included being named the head coach of the women’s team for the 2012 Games in London, making her the first and only female head coach of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. Cal men’s coach Dave Durden received a [six-figure raise](https://swimswam.com/dave-durden-received-a-110000-raise-to-take-over-cal-womens-team/) to take over the women’s team as well in the wake of McKeever’s departure.",

    "text": "Il vero problema di Dragon Age: Veilguard non sono i contenuti inclusivi: la nostra prova su RTX 4080, Steam Deck e PS5 Pro\nSono settimane che se ne discute, e le mancate candidature ai vari Game Awards e simili hanno ritirato fuori l'argomento. Dragon Age: The Veilguard è riuscito a dividere l'utenza e la stampa specializzata come tanti altri titoli che hanno caratterizzato questo bizzarro 2024.\nSi è molto puntato il dito sugli elementi di gioco inclusivi, che sono presenti non solo nell'editor dei personaggi, ma anche in alcuni personaggi e in alcuni dialoghi.\nPer quanto proprio alcuni di questi ultimi risultino surreali, primo fra tutti quello che vede uno dei personaggi di turno sedersi al tavolo iniziando il discorso con un \"So... I'm non binary\", l'inclusività non è il problema principale di Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\nTogliamoci il dente\nSugli elementi inclusivi infatti non solo ci si può passare sopra, ma ci si dovrebbe obbligatoriamente passare sopra. Anzi, non dovrebbero nemmeno essere così al centro dell'attenzione.\nCiò che dovrebbe far discutere non è la loro presenza, quanto più come talvolta questi elementi sono proposti, come visto nell'esempio di poco fa.\nIl fatto che l'editor proponga valanghe di opzioni, abbastanza da permettere a chiunque nel mondo di plasmare un personaggio a propria immagine e somiglianza, dovrebbe essere una cosa da lodare, non certo da etichettare come \"inclusiva\" con accezione negativa o, peggio ancora, offensiva.\nMa lasciamoci tutto questo alle spalle. Come già detto, i problemi di The Veilguard sono ben altri:\n- è il seguito di una serie apprezzata da milioni di utenti in tutto il mondo, e i toni, le atmosfere, i dialoghi e la narrativa è quanto di più distante possibile dai suoi illustri predecessori;\n- alcuni dialoghi sono purtroppo \"banalotti\", e la colpa non è della traduzione italiana. Sono proprio scambi semplici, talvolta disarmanti nel loro essere elementari. Anche qui il pensiero vola ai predecessori;\n- alcuni personaggi, in primis il protagonista, sono quasi totalmente privi di charme. Stiamo parlando di BioWare: dove è finito lo spessore di personaggi di giochi quali Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic e Dragon Age: Origins?\n- Il gameplay è molto poco gioco di ruolo e molto gioco di azione, forse anche un pelo troppo. O meglio, ci sono tanti Action RPG divertentissimi, ma da un Dragon Age ci si aspettava forse qualcosa di più incisivo da un punto di vista ruolistico;\n- la maggior parte dei puzzle ambientali è più che altro fastidioso, ripetitivo e poco azzeccato per un gioco del genere.\nE queste sono solo alcune delle critiche che gli si potrebbe muovere.\nSecondo me c'è stato anche un errore di fondo sul come è stato presentato il gioco.\nDagli screenshot che banalmente potete vedere anche su Steam, sembra di avere a che fare con uno di quei giochi per smartphone che si vedono negli annunci pubblicitari, con grafiche elaboratissime e tirate a lucido che poi in realtà si dimostrano tutt'altro. E non è così, badate bene.\nE poi c'è il discorso Dragon Age. Fosse uscito come un gioco a sé stante avrebbe forse avuto il suo perché. Alcune dinamiche di gioco non si discostano troppo da un Hogwarts Legacy (anzi, il sistema di uso delle abilità un po' ce lo ha ricordato) o da un God of War: Ragnarok (non uccidetemi, NdR), e tanti giocatori potrebbero trovarle gradevoli e divertenti.\nPerò appunto, l'appartenenza a una saga storica, l'apparire di personaggi visti nei capitoli precedenti, e la speranza di mettere le mani su un gioco di ruolo, hanno deluso più di un giocatore.\nUn disastro su tutta la linea?\nNo, non è un disastro su tutta la linea. Il metascore di 82 punti è assolutamente esagerato, non giriamoci troppo intorno. Ciò non toglie che i suoi momenti il gioco li ha.\nIl sistema di combattimento non è così male, e appunto, è molto più action del previsto, e ai giusti livelli di difficoltà potrebbe darvi del filo da torcere.\nI compagni di squadra sono gestiti dall'intelligenza artificiale, ma da controller premendo R1 attivate il menu di pausa che vi permette di indirizzarli verso nemici specifici o attivare una delle 3 abilità a loro disposizione sempre verso bersagli specifici.\nI poteri dei compagni possono anche essere combinati, dando luogo a colpi piuttosto potenti e facilmente incapacitanti per nemici di bassa/medio lega. E poi ci sono le vostre 3 abilità. Sì, sono poche, soprattutto per un wannabe RPG, ma i combattimenti sono così frenetici che risultano essere più che sufficienti. Anche perché, banalmente, con un guerriero dovete parare (dando luogo a sbilanciamenti), rotolare via, attaccare in corpo a corpo e usare le 3 abilità e impartire comandi.\nDi roba da fare ce n'è.\nAh: prima ho fatto cenno ai puzzle ambientali, alcuni piuttosto noiosi, ripetitivi e pensati solo per riempire il tempo. Sempre a loro proposito, il gioco include anche delle dinamiche metroidvania che dipendono da quale compagno di squadra portate con voi nelle singole avventure. Una scelta peculiare, soprattutto per un gioco di questo tipo.\nIl comparto grafico, per quanto tendente al \"cartoon\", sia nei colori che nei modelli, non è affatto malvagio, e anzi, almeno su PC mette a dura prova anche l'hardware più moderno.\nQuindi, chi potrebbe divertirsi con un gioco del genere? Paradossalmente chi non è un grande fan della serie, e chi cerca un gioco di azione leggero e non troppo cervellotico che abbia comunque un grado di sfida decente, almeno a livelli alti.\nNon male su Steam Deck\nGraficamente è pesantino come gioco. Ciò nonostante, non solo è certificato per Steam Deck, ma si lascia giocare anche abbastanza bene.\nI dettagli grafici sono ovviamente ridotti al minimo, e mentirei se vi dicessi che non si vede. Su altri titoli si nota decisamente di meno! E con minimo intendo che se andate a spippolare nelle impostazioni, i settaggi sono quasi tutti al minimo di default. Però è già tanto che funzioni, ecco. Un gioco come [Space Marine 2](/recensioni/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2), anche al minimo dei settaggi, è praticamente ingiocabile su Steam Deck.\nCiò nonostante, ci si fa l'abitudine abbastanza velocemente, e ben presto il livello di dettaglio lascia spazio all'esperienza di gioco e al divertimento, sempre vi piaccia il genere si intende.\nIl battery drain del titolo non è nemmeno così eccessivo, anche se giocherete con la ventola costantemente al massimo. Ve lo dico giusto nel caso giochiate con qualcuno accanto che potrebbe lamentarsi del rumore (ogni riferimento a persone o mogli realmente esistenti non è puramente casuale, NdR).\nE su PC?\nCome accennato, Dragon Age: The Veilguard non è il più leggero fra i giochi usciti ultimamente.\nL'ho provato prevalentemente su Acer Predator Helios 18 dotato di GPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Max-Q dove, seppur con qualche sacrificio, ci si può anche permettere di farlo girare al massimo delle impostazioni consentite.\nÈ ovviamente necessario attivare sia il DLSS 3 (Generazione dei Frame) sia il DLSS 2 per stabilizzare il tutto a livello di performance. Questo perché Dragon Age ha non solo il [Ray Tracing](/informatica/ray-tracing-spiegato.html), ma anche l'Ultra Ray Tracing (il Path Tracing per intenderci). Quindi le funzionalità extra di NVIDIA tornano molto utili.\n-\nDragon Age: The Veilguard Standard Edition PCWin | Codice EA App - Origin per PC | Videogiochi | Italiano\nIl colpo d'occhio però, al netto di quanto detto prima sullo stile, in certi frangenti non è davvero niente male. Durante le battaglie poi ci sono vari effetti pirotecnici in grado di riempire lo schermo e mettere un po' a dura prova le performance del vostro PC. C'è anche la modalità fotografica nel caso vogliate soffermarvi ad ammirare i vari dettagli.\nComunque, se volete spremerlo al massimo e usare poco (o quasi) upscaling, come il Super Sampling di NVIDIA, è necessario spostarsi su macchine desktop dotate di GPU recenti.\nE poi c'è PS5\nDirò un'ultima cosa che farà storcere il naso ai puristi di Dragon Age. Questo nuovo capitolo è perfettamente confezionato per Console. Ecco, l'ho detto. Ed è anche per questo che su Steam Deck è piacevole da giocare. Idem potenzialmente su una PlayStation Portal.\nPersino su PC l'ho giocato con un DualSense, perché alla fine le dinamiche action e il menù che blocca l'azione sono palesemente strutturati per dare il meglio su console e con controller alla mano.\nSu PS5 ha le impostazioni per favorire il dettaglio grafico o le performance. Manco a dirlo, quest'ultima è l'impostazione più sensata: la sua vena action richiede fluidità su schermo, sia per il bene degli occhi sia per seguire al meglio quello che succede.\nOvviamente su PS5 Pro, dove lo avevo provato per la recensione della console, gira pure meglio, con la possibilità di raggiungere la risoluzione 4K nativa ad alto frame rate, o favorire i dettagli grafici al massimo a discapito come sempre delle performance.\nComunque anche sul modello classico se la cava più che decentemente.\nSu alcuni dei link inseriti in questa pagina SmartWorld ha un'affiliazione ed ottiene una percentuale dei ricavi, tale affiliazione non fa variare il prezzo del prodotto acquistato.

    "title": "Teryl Austin Expects Seahawks To Attack Middle Of The Field Against Steelers: ‘Kind of Our Achilles’ Heel’",
    "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have been dealt blow after blow at inside linebacker this season. First, the team lost Cole Holcomb and Kwon Alexander for the season in back-to-back weeks, and then LB Elandon Roberts suffered a pectoral injury that is likely to sideline him for Sunday’s game against the Seattle Seahawks. With Myles Jack and Mykal Walker the likely starters at the position on Sunday, defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said he’d expect the Seahawks to attack the middle of field, which he called Pittsburgh’s Achilles heel.\n“I mean, over in the middle is kind of our Achilles’ heel right now. I think they would probably try to get all those guys in there at some point.\nIt’s our job to defend it. We have to do a better job. I’ve got to help our guys get in better positions. But I think they are all capable of going\nover the middle and making some hay down there. They have got three quality guys,” Austin said via transcript provided by the team, while also mentioning tight end Noah Fant as someone who the Seahawks can deploy over the middle of the field against Pittsburgh.\nBetween WRs D.K. Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the Seahawks have plenty of weapons they can take advantage of in the passing game. That’s where Austin expects them to try and attack against Pittsburgh, and the Steelers linebackers have struggled in coverage. In particular, Mykal Walker has been an issue when it comes to coverage, as he was responsible for Tee Higgins getting free on his touchdown last week and he struggled in coverage against TEs Trey McBride and Hunter Henry earlier this season.\nPittsburgh also might be down LB Elandon Roberts on Sunday, and he’s actually taken some positive steps forward in coverage despite being considered somewhat of a liability in that phase of the game. Pittsburgh will rely on Walker and ILB Myles Jack, along with Blake Martinez, as their linebacker trio on Sunday and it’s not a group that inspires a ton of confidence in the coverage side of things.\nIt’s why Austin made a point to note Fant as someone who can do some damage against Pittsburgh despite his pedestrian numbers this season. Fant has topped 50 yards just twice this season and only has 27 grabs for 355 yards and has been held without a touchdown, but he is athletic and if the Steelers aren’t careful, QB Geno Smith will look to him.\nWhile Austin specifically mentioned the passing attack, Seattle’s run game is also solid with the running back duo of Zack Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker II. It’s going to be important for Pittsburgh’s linebackers to step up, and even though it’s a skeleton crew with a lot of different faces from the beginning of the season, it’s the group they have to work with. Jack was solid in Week 16 against the Bengals, and the Steelers are going to need him to step up along with the rest of the inside ‘backers.\nIt’s an important game for the Steelers, and even if the position is their weakest, it’s one they’re going to need to get production from if they want to beat Seattle.",
