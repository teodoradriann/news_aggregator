    "title": "Check out photos of the Northern Lights last night from skywatchers across Wisconsin",
    "text": "Due to a rare, strong geomagnetic storm, aurora borealis may be visible again tonight. The northern lights graced night skies across Wisconsin and the U.S. on Thursday night after an eruption of solar material caused the NOAA Space Weather Prediction to issue a severe geomagnetic storm watch . Watches at this level are very rare. Strong geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operation, NOAA says. The watch continues into early Saturday morning, so if you missed the aurora borealis Thursday night, you still may be able to see them Friday night. But, if you can't catch the northern lights either night, you can enjoy these photos taken in Milwaukee and Wisconsin Thursday night. More: Northern lights could be visible in Wisconsin as part of a 'very rare' solar storm this week What causes the northern lights? Also known as aurora borealis, the northern lights are a natural light display in Earth's sky that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen , causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon. As auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time. When northern lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Are the northern lights becoming more common? This isn't the first time this year people throughout Wisconsin caught a glimpse of the northern lights. In May, a powerful geomagnetic storm unleashed spectacular views of the northern lights in areas of the U.S. where auroras are seldom visible, including here in Milwaukee . As the sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter northern-light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity. Best places in Wisconsin to see the northern lights Here's a list of places in Wisconsin that could offer some of the best views of the night sky: Newport State Park , Ellison Bay Driftless Region, Wisconsin Harrington Beach State Park , Belgium Kettle Moraine State Forest , Eagle Kohler-Andrae State Park , Sheboygan Parnell Tower , Plymouth Journal Sentinel reporter Alex Groth contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Unique encounters between Jewish and Arab high school students - Israel News - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "A unique program bringing together high school students from Arab and Jewish schools came to its exciting and moving end last week at Bar-Ilan University. The program, named the High School Program for Leadership and Law, is hosted by the Menomadim Center for Jewish and Democratic Law, headquartered at the faculty of law at Bar-Ilan University.According to Elad Caplan, a lawyer from a modern-orthodox background and director of the Menomadin Center, the program aims to bring together different groups in Israeli society in an atmosphere of learning and discussion, and thus create agents for change. &ldquo;We are trying to create a bridge between the Jewish and democratic identities of Israel &ndash; as well as a bridge between the academic sphere and Israeli society.&rdquo;In an educational scheme divided into four separate school systems for the different sectors of Israeli society, encounters between the different groups in a school environment are not very common. &ldquo;This is probably not going to change in the near future,&rdquo; Caplan adds, &ldquo;but when it comes to the field of citizenship studies, it becomes absurd. This study field is the very essence of our joint Israeli identity, yet it&rsquo;s all carried out in closed echo chambers. Our idea here is to shatter those echo chambers and develop dialogue from a shared perspective.&rdquo;console.log(\"BODY2. CatId is:\"+catID);if(catID==120){ console.log(\"BODY.

This means that our university students are also empowered in the process, in addition to the high school students brought here. They acquire tools, knowledge, and experience, and all become agents for change&rdquo; adds Caplan. Dr. Manal Totry Jubran, academic head of the High School Program for Leadership and Law at Bar Ilan University, speaking to participating students (credit: YONI REIF)Dr. Manal Totry Jubran, an Arab lawyer and academic from Haifa who serves as the academic head of the program, adds that &ldquo;some of the most shaping and moving encounters were those of our faculty students. Such encounters during a war are never simple, but all of them felt the need to meet and discuss.&ldquo;The idea of the program is to hold an insightful academic discussion, not just a social encounter,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;We work with texts, study them together, reflect, and then create the grounds for dialogue. Our goal is that people will engage in meaningful conversation.&rdquo;&ldquo;This unique combination of study and communication enables us to discuss difficult issues. We can always use the texts to moderate the discussion and focus on understanding the different perspectives, even when there are fundamental disagreements,&rdquo; adds Caplan. He holds that this kind of discourse is relevant and important for any kind of intellectual discourse: &ldquo;We can disagree, but we must understand each other.&rdquo; The Arab-Jewish programThe high school program was first aimed at bringing together schools from the secular and religious sectors of Jewish society; but since last year, the center has developed an additional program that brings together Jewish and Arab high school students.&ldquo;This year the program was supposed to be even larger, but for obvious reasons, it became a great challenge. There were times when we thought of canceling this year&rsquo;s program, but we are happy that we managed to carry it out, especially this year and in this situation,&rdquo; explains Caplan.&ldquo;We were surprised that the schools themselves insisted on coming and holding these sessions,&rdquo; adds Totry Jubran. This includes an Arab school from Sakhnin and a Jewish school, Ankory Rishon Letziyon, both of which were determined to see this program happen this year.\"In the end, over 300 high school students from 5 schools, as well as 40 students from the Bar-Ilan law faculty, took part in the program this year. Two mediators were present in each group, a Jewish one and an Arab one. &ldquo;For some, it was the first interaction with a student from the other group &ndash;even those who have met people from the other group rarely have the chance to have a meaningful conversation&rdquo; Caplan comments.The program includes full school days, from 9:00-13:00. First, the students are gathered for a joint general session, then they split into smaller groups of fourteen students and two mediators, where they delve into significant legal texts, such as the Declaration of Independence, religious sources, court verdicts, conventions, and more. Following that, students go through a reflection session in which they are asked to perform joint intellectual exercises such as attempting to formulate guidelines for a shared covenant. Finally, they reconvene and listen to a lecture by public figures.&ldquo;We show the students examples of past agreements and urge them to work together to find solutions. Legal language and thought are involved in fundamental social issues and can be a source of conflict, but also a basis for thinking a shared basis for our society,&rdquo; Caplan elaborates.Challenges along the wayThe war brought with it many technical challenges, such as the recurring postponement of the academic year in Israel; the fact that some students were not even present due to their being in reserve duty, and more. &ldquo;We had to shorten the program and, following the advice of experts on the issue of mediation and group facilitation, we decided to hold inward preparation sessions for each of the groups before meeting the other groups,&rdquo; adds Totry Jubran.And then there were also content-related challenges. Some students from the university had just come back from weeks of reserve duty, while others were fearful or hesitant, thinking it wasn&rsquo;t the right time for such encounters. &ldquo;It was not simple, but we have no other choice but to work together as much as we can within the situation. By the final session we had with the faculty students, the mediators expressed gratitude for taking part in the program. Many of them had gotten to know each other so well that they completed each other&rsquo;s thoughts. Some brave friendships were created,&rdquo; says Caplan gladly.&ldquo;The program usually makes a point of not evading delicate issues, and our goals were always twofold: in-depth learning and creating an atmosphere which allows participants to leave with a positive feeling,&rdquo; explains Caplan. &ldquo;This year we put a larger emphasis on the second goal, focusing on a respectful discussion and space to discuss difficult issues within the identity group.&rdquo;Totry Jobran added that this year they chose to focus on the issues of the nation state and the Nation-State Law, as well as collective rights in Israel. &ldquo;We chose complex subjects but focused on those which can be discussed during times of war,&rdquo; Caplan elaborated.There were times when the discourse was on edge. One Arab student said she didn&rsquo;t want to speak Hebrew to the Jewish mediator in the first inward meeting. Then the group processed what happened inwardly and the student came back even more active than before.Is there a way to gauge the success of this program?&ldquo;Oh yes, we evaluate everything,&rdquo; adds Caplan with a smile. &ldquo;Students and mediators receive a feedback form which they must fill out. We measure the effectiveness of the learning process, asking for instance if it added to their knowledge regarding the issues discussed; and we can also measure the significance of the encounter by asking whether they would like to continue the discussion, or if their belief in sustaining a joint society strengthened.&rdquo;&ldquo;Feedback was exceptional,&rdquo; adds Totry Jubran. &ldquo;We were told that the experience was positive and empowering; the encounter was natural, and the youth generally enjoyed it. It was actually less challenging and emotionally charged than we thought it would be.&rdquo;How do Arab students view a program whose name explicitly refers to a Jewish and Democratic state?&ldquo;Arab society has a role to play in discourse about Israel&rsquo;s identity as a Jewish and Democratic state, and should not be excluded,&rdquo; says Caplan.Totry Jubran ads: &ldquo;The state is defined as Jewish and Democratic everywhere. While it might not be easy or compelling for some parts of society, it would not prevent me from trying to promote positive encounters such as this program.&rdquo;Caplan added that studies led by the Center showed that following October 7th, Arab society in Israel is showing more openness to strengthening ties with the Jewish Israeli public, as well as more sympathy with the state, and a greater willingness for dialogue. On the other hand, they also showed that Jewish Israeli society has grown more suspicious, falsely believing that most Arabs support Hamas. &ldquo;It would be a shame if we miss out on this opportunity to strengthen the connection between the Arab sector and the State of Israel.&rdquo;&ldquo;Even before the war started, I knew that this program is the future of the country,&rdquo; adds Totry Jubran. She brings up her childhood, growing up in the mixed city of Haifa and participating in encounter programs as a teenager herself; also reminding that her research field deals with encounters and mixed cities.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no alternative for a real encounter. It&rsquo;s something you acquire that you can&rsquo;t get from any other source &ndash; news, research, nothing. When you bring together people to one place, they realize that all are human beings who both share and differ in traits, interests and even pain. I wish these meetings would become more frequent and thus contribute to a common future.",

    "title": "Helpful botanicals for wrist pain",
    "text": "Wrist pain can be the result of some short temporal assault or a long-term condition. The symptoms of the pain vary according to the underlying cause. For example, pain due to osteoarthritis is dull, whereas pain from a fracture is sharp and more annoying. Wrist pain is a prevalent disease that leads to debilitation worldwide. The prevalence of wrist pain is said to be about 10 per cent in the general population. The frequent usage of wrists for working and bearing weight makes them susceptible to injuries and stresses. Wrist pain can also be caused by fracture, tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, cysts (ganglion), arthritis (rheumatoid and osteoarthritis), or inflammation. One may feel the following symptoms with the pain: swelling, joint stiffness, redness of overlying skin, warmth, and tenderness. Victims should seek expert advice if the pain is intense and lasts longer than a few days, or if a crack is heard, motion becomes impaired, or severe swelling occurs. Helpful botanicals to relieve wrist pain Certain botanical treatments, which have proven to help ease hand pain, include the following: Garlic – the herb possesses powerful anti-inflammatory properties shown to ease pains in the wrist. The way garlic is processed or prepared can really change its health benefits. The enzyme alliinase, which converts alliin into the beneficial allicin, only works under certain conditions. It can also be deactivated by heat. Studies have shown that as little as 1 minute of microwaving or 45 minutes in the oven can deactivate alliinase. Since most of the therapeutic potentials of the vegetable are lost through cooking, many studies suggest that raw or aged garlic is most effective in pain management/reduction. Here are a few ways to optimize the health benefits of garlic: Ensure whole garlic is crushed, chewed, or sliced before it is taken. Let crushed garlic stand for 5-10 minutes before you cook it. This increases the allicin content as well as prevents the loss of the medicinal properties of garlic. You could add a few more garlic cloves to your meals to compensate for the effects of cooking. Use more than one clove per meal if you’re feeling brave! Shun the notorious garlicky odour; your body will surely be happy. You may use some mints afterwards! To maximize the benefit of this valuable vegetable, do not always cook it. You can add some raw, crushed garlic to a homemade salad dressing or juice, for example, and this would avoid any cooking. You can make apple juice with garlic: 1-2 apples, quartered; 1 medium cucumber with its peel; 1 clove of garlic, peeled. Blend all together and enjoy this refreshing ”Garlicky Apple Booster”. Do not let your wrist pain knock you down. Garlic supplementation is perfect for knocking out the pains! Mustard – another herb that is prominent in bringing about relief from wrist ache and wrist tendonitis is mustard. Mustard seeds have long been used to treat inflammation of the body. The natural anti-inflammatory properties of this botanical are attributed mainly to its selenium and magnesium contents. The selenium has been shown to help decrease some of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and gout. The magnesium may restore normal sleep patterns in people having difficulty with the symptoms associated with wrist pains. Mustard seeds also contain Omega-3 fatty acids, which further help reduce inflammation and its accompanying secondary symptoms. Consuming mustard can be a beneficial step in providing relief. It is recommended to chew about 10 gm of mustard seeds and drink a glass of water, kept under room temperature 2 X daily. The topical application of a mustard plaster has proven to reduce inflammation in arthritic joints. Cayenne pepper – powerful pain relieving spice! Cayenne pepper, like all hot chilli peppers, is rich in the chemical compound capsaicin. It is this compound that brings about pain relief. A study investigated the effect of capsaicin on nerve pain and found positive effects. Therefore, it can be said that nerve pain arising from Carpal Tunnel syndrome can also be alleviated using the spice. Topical capsaicin – when applied to the hand, capsaicin provides a heating sensation that blocks pain signals. This provides relief from muscle or joint pain. Black pepper – piperine is the active ingredient in black pepper. This property is the cause of the pungent smell you get when black pepper gets near you. This alkaloid plays an important role in providing you with pain relief. A study carried out on rats found that piperine significantly reduces pain in lumbar disc herniation cases by reducing pro-inflammatory factors. Black pepper and turmeric multiply the analgesic properties. According to some studies, the combination of piperine and curcumin has shown to be immensely beneficial in managing pain in osteoarthritis patients. Curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric. It has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce pain and swelling. Therefore, a combination of turmeric and black pepper will be ideal in achieving pain relief.

While there is so much to do in Tennessee, I love nothing more than an excuse to drive through the Smoky Mountains. I don't know about you, but it seems like lately, the mountains have been calling my name! In my personal opinion, the Smoky Mountains are the perfect place to go for a long weekend getaway. You can visit a cool little city like Gatlinburg or Chattanooga, or you can take a road trip and wind your way through mountains, and see more of Tennessee's gorgeous landscape. So how about a road trip through the state that will take you through several really cool tunnels? Read full article\nRead in NewsBreak 3",

    "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec 1 – The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists, and Dentists Union (KMPPDU) will formally issue strike notices to both the national government and the 47 county governments on December 2, in protest of the government’s failure to address their grievances related to remuneration and welfare.\nNational Secretary General Davji Atellah made the announcement after over 600 delegates at this year’s Special Delegates Conference ratified the proposal put forward by the union leadership.\nThe health workers have vowed to down tools unless the government implements the Return to Work Formula (RTWF) signed on May 8, 2024. They are also demanding the immediate release of Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) arrears and the payment of intern salaries in accordance with the CBA.\n“This decision comes as we continue to face deliberate violations of the CBA and a lack of goodwill from both levels of government to implement the RTWF signed on May 8, 2024,” Atellah said. He also highlighted that the unlawful reduction of intern doctors’ wages to Ksh 41,000 is a direct violation of the previously agreed CBA.\nAccording to the KMPPDU SG, the strike notice will mark the beginning of a concerted effort to demand equitable treatment, adherence to contracts, and the prompt resolution of the doctors’ pressing issues.\nThe Special Delegates Conference focused on addressing challenges affecting medical professionals, including the internship deadlock, CBA arrears, and the mental health crisis among doctors.\nThe Union’s resolution comes just hours after the Ministry of Health confirmed the disbursement of Sh965.9 million in monthly stipends and arrears owed to nursing officers, clinical officers, medical officers, dentists, and pharmacist interns.\nHealth Cabinet Secretary Debora Barasa stated that the amount includes Sh528.6 million in arrears payments and Sh110.6 million in regular payments for nursing and clinical officer interns. Additionally, Barasa noted that the ministry allocated Ksh 326.6 million for arrears payments to medical officer interns, dental officer interns, and pharmacist interns.",
