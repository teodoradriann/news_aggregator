    "text": "UK's Massive Carbon Initiative and Auto Industry Challenges The UK government has pledged significant financial support for carbon capture projects, totaling up to 21.7 billion pounds. Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves highlights the need for investment in the EV market, criticizing previous budget cuts. Anglo American's CEO comments on the uncertain future of a new buyer post divestment. The UK has announced a funding package worth 21.7 billion pounds aimed at kickstarting the nation's first carbon capture and storage projects. This initiative marks a significant step for the developing sector but underscores the substantial costs involved. In political developments, Rachel Reeves criticized her predecessor's budget cuts and opened the door for increased capital investment. She emphasized the urgent need for tax incentives to encourage electric vehicle purchases as the auto sector warns of potential financial penalties without such measures. On the corporate front, Anglo American's CEO expressed uncertainty about the emergence of a new buyer following the group's strategic sell-off, which comes after BHP's unsuccessful 39 billion pounds takeover.

    "text": "Dear Editor,\nAs a physician, a parent, and a member of this community, I’m writing to express deep concern over the way the Bandon School District is treating its teachers—and by extension, our children.\nDear Editor,\nAs a physician, a parent, and a member of this community, I’m writing to express deep concern over the way the Bandon School District is treating its teachers—and by extension, our children.\nOur teachers are the lowest paid in the region, and rather than addressing this long-standing inequity with serious solutions, the current leadership offers only minimal cost-of-living increases. These are not meaningful raises—they are crumbs. At the same time, reports of retaliation against union leaders, including forced transfers and reassignments, are deeply troubling and, if accurate, illegal.\nBeyond the legal implications, this approach is a moral failure. Morale among teachers is at an all-time low. Many no longer feel respected, supported, or safe in their positions. We cannot expect excellence in education when the people we entrust to shape our children’s minds are treated as expendable.\nLeadership is not about control or compliance—it’s about service. True leaders, especially in education, act as servant leaders. They lift their people up. They invest in them. They listen, collaborate, and do what’s right—not what’s easy or politically convenient. Our school staff are the school system. Without them, there is no mission, no learning, no future.\nOur teachers deserve better. Our children deserve better. And our community must do better. I stand with the educators of our district and call on the superintendent and school board to restore integrity, fairness, and servant leadership to our schools.\nSincerely,\nAnn Kellogg\nBandon, Parent and Community Physician\nView our 6-24-25 E-edition right here!\nSuccess!

    "text": "Ukrainian officials have hit back at the Pope's comments that Kyiv should have the \"courage\" to negotiate an end to the war with Russia.Pope Francis also used the phase \"white flag\" which many interpreted as a call for Ukraine to surrender.“I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” said Pope Francis.The comments, made during an interview with Swiss broadcaster RSI, have angered officials in Ukraine, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.“Our flag is blue and yellow. We live, die and win under it. We will not raise other flags,” he posted on X, formally Twitter.Kuleba also invited Francis to Ukraine, saying the pope's visit would show support for “more than a million Ukrainian (Roman) Catholics, more than 5 million Greek Catholics, all Christians and all Ukrainians.\"Meanwhile, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski tweeted: “How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine?\"Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations.”The head of Ukraine's Greek Catholic Church, Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, said that surrender is not on the minds of Ukrainians.“Ukraine is exhausted, but it stands and will endure,\" he said. \"Believe me, it never crosses anyone’s mind to surrender.\"Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni clarified that the pope supported “a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations,” rather than an outright Ukrainian surrender.Bruni said that the journalist interviewing Francis used the term “white flag” in the question that prompted the controversial remarks. During the interview the Pope added: \"When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate. Negotiations are never a surrender.”Kyiv remains firm on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said multiple times that the initiative in peace negotiations must come from the country that has been invaded.

    "text": "Opinión | Con sabor a guindas\nCuidemos del mar\nComo alívío de su cuerpo y alma\nLes confieso que el mar, la mar como a mi me gusta llamarla, es mi refugio como madre, amiga y compañera, que siempre he sabido quererla sin pretenderla cambiar. Diría que es el amor de mi vida. Nací a sus orillas en ese hermoso lugar llamado Ribadesella. Estudié Náutica y promesa hice de visitarla con frecuencia.\nPor ello, en estos días que la mar se hace preocupación por su lucha ante esos vertidos de plástico, debemos reflexionar con nuestra colaboración para que ese problema desaparezca. Nuestra conciencia nos dicta que debe de ser un compromiso de todos con deseos de afrontar ese desafío con gran firmeza y sin olvidos.\nTenemos que darnos cuenta que la mar es muy necesaria para nuestra supervivencia. Los filósofos griegos en su doctrina nos dicen que todo empezó en el mar. Lo anticipa también Leonardo Da Vinci cuando anunció que la mar es el respirar del mundo. Lo que demuestra que la urgencia por su cuidado viene de siglos, misión que vamos mejorando para ese bien colectivo.\nPor mí parte, soy un amigo íntimo de la mar. Me gusta hablarle en silencio, contarle mis sentimientos, y descansar mi mirada en su inmenso horizonte, tratando de adivinar sus milagros y misterios. Me encantan sus puestas de sol, su olor a salitre y yodo, su calma y su bravura, y ver como sus olas buscan su descanso sobre las arenas de sus playas.\nHace unos días la visité al amparo de la noche y aunque, entre lágrimas, se cubría con nubes de caricia, yo, en mis silencios, escuchaba el latido de su anciano corazón. Me sentí feliz y tendí mi voz para hablarle con respeto y nadando, entre olas, me la devolvió con un eco cargado de emociones. De nuevo, me voy mar adentro, con la mirada perdida en busca de esperanza.\nLa noche seguía su camino, esperando al alba, y la marea empezaba su resaca, y en ese instante, en oración prudente, se me ocurre pedirle a Dios una oración por los naufragios a lo largo del tiempo. Me vuelvo a llenar de silencios y bajo sus consejos medito en su presencia.\nPienso que no podemos vestirla de soledad sino de cariño y ofrecerle promesas de profunda fe, llamando a diario a su puerta, en la seguridad que nos la abrirá con gesto amable y sonriente.\nDecido antes de enviar mí artículo, a LA NUEVA ESPAÑA, leerle su contenido y en mi encuentro me acompañan barcos que descansan en el puerto, sonido de rula, redes sobre el asfalto, gaviotas que aterrizan y despegan, y pescadores que lanzan sus cañas al viento en busca de fortuna.\nEl día es de un fino \"orbayu\" que iba y venía escondiéndose en un tibio sol, lleno de colores y luces, que, en una mezcla de grises y azules, navegaba, por la carpa de un cielo bordado de nubes juguetonas que una brisa suave mecía a su capricho, teniendo como testigos el faro de Somos y la virgen marinera de Guía\nMe dije entonces, lleno de felicidad, qué más puedo desear que vivir junto a la mar y compartir con ella mis amistades. Así las cosas, les dejo con mi título inicial: CUIDEMOS DEL MAR, COMO ALIVIO DE SU CUERPO Y ALMA. Que así sea.\nOriente Esto opina el PSOE de Llanes sobre la decisión del Principado de dotar ya al concejo de unas normas urbanísticas provisionales https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/14/comienzan-obras-eliminaran-punto-negro-98175429.html Comienzan las obras que eliminarán un \"punto negro\" en la N-625: la intersección abierta de Vega los Caseros, en Parres https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/14/denuncian-supuesto-vertido-contaminante-rio-98169792.html Denuncian un supuesto vertido contaminante en el río Güeña, a su paso por Cangas de Onís https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/13/regresan-llanes-jueves-pincho-98116955.html Regresan a Llanes los \"Jueves de Pincho https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/15/nace-travesina-cabraliega-ninos-jovenes-98188948.html Nace la Travesina Cabraliega, para niños y jóvenes de 6 a 16 años https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/15/denuncian-supuesto-vertido-contaminante-rio-98169792.html https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/15/denuncian-supuesto-vertido-contaminante-rio-98169792.html https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/14/vuelven-mercado-lechazos-probiodiversidad-picos-98158850.html Vuelven al mercado los lechazos ‘ProBiodiversidad’ de los Picos de Europa, premio Natura2000 de la Comisión Europea https://www.lne.es/oriente/2024/02/15/menudos-elementos-toriellu-triunfan-carnaval-98120873.html Menudos Elementos\" de Toriellu triunfan en el Carnaval de Ribadesella\nCon sabor a guindas\nCuidemos del mar\nOriente Opinión\nForofismo y política internacional\nOriente Opinión",

Once this finally clears through, we will see some blustery showers feeding in behind it, affecting the very far north and north west, and some of these could be wintry on higher ground. Away from that, we have a dry and clear night ahead that will lead to some frost in places and also some icy stretches where we’ve had any showers.\nOn Saturday, we have a brief spell of sunshine in the morning ahead of clouds and outbreaks of rain moving in from the west. We then enter a warmer sector of air, and therefore, things will be turning milder, with temperatures climbing throughout the weekend.\nBy Sunday, we see a trailing cold front lingering across the north of Scotland. It doesn’t go anywhere and sticks around for a good couple of days, bringing persistent rain. This is why the Met Office has issued a weather warning for rain that lasts from Sunday evening until Tuesday afternoon.\nWe will likely see flooding in places and tricky travel conditions as 70-100mm of rain is expected within the warning zone during that timeframe. Any snowmelt in the area will also contribute to this.\nOut of the warning zone, we will still see some outbreaks of rain, with things remaining changeable and unsettled for the first half of the week but not as persistent or heavy.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country\nFollow STV News\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country\nPosted in Weather",
