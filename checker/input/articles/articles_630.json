    "title": "Indo-Danish Plastic Innovation Network Hosts Round-Table on Sustainability; Launches Green Fellowship by M3M Foundation",
    "text": "New Delhi: The Indo-Danish Plastic Innovation Network hosted a landmark round-table at The Oberoi focused on driving sustainability and innovation in plastic waste management. As a significant stride towards building a more sustainable future, the Green Fellowship Program under Mashaal by M3M Foundation was officially launched, which will provide financial grants to select start-ups, incubators, and entrepreneurs dedicated to technological advancements in various sectors related to climate change and environmental protection. This is a joint initiative by DRIIV and M3M Foundation aimed at supporting technological innovations in climate change mitigation, environmental conservation, and sustainable practices.\nDRIIV, the umbrella body of the Delhi Science and Technology (S&T) cluster under the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, has been tasked with becoming a local and national solution provider for pressing environmental and societal challenges by aligning innovations with purpose.\nWith India currently producing around 3.4 million tons of plastic waste each year—of which less than 50% is recycled—this initiative stands as a crucial step towards developing impactful solutions to address the country’s growing waste management challenges. The gathering brought together key policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and stakeholders from India and Denmark to explore collaborative strategies for advancing the circular economy.\nDr. Payal Kanodia, Chairperson & Trustee, M3M Foundation expressed firmly on the occasion “Sustainability is not just an option; it’s our responsibility. With the Green Fellowship Program under Mashaal, we’re championing innovative solutions to reshape our relationship with plastic.”\nThe event’s highlight session titled “Mobilizing Corporate Support into Sustainability” was chaired by Ms. Shipra Misra, MD & CEO of DRIIV. Ms. Misra emphasized & evoked the need for businesses to integrate sustainability into their core strategies, not just as a responsibility but as an opportunity for innovation and growth. It was a call to action for companies to take a proactive role in shaping a more sustainable and resilient future.\nThis session explored the scope for industry players to engage in open innovation challenges and collaborative R&D projects focused on creating eco-friendly materials and improving recycling efficiency. By bringing together key players from the plastic value chain, the session inspired co-creation of commercially viable solutions that not only minimize plastic waste but also promote sustainable production practices. The Mashaal’s Green Fellowship will focus on a range of critical areas, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, development of energy storage solutions, sustainable mobility, waste-to-energy technologies, air pollution mitigation, water security, and healthcare innovations. By supporting initiatives that address these key environmental challenges, the fellowship aims to foster a new generation of solutions that contribute to a more sustainable future. With the combined strengths of India and Denmark in research, technology, and commercialization, this event represents a significant step towards creating a circular and sustainable plastic economy, ultimately benefiting both countries and the global community.\nAbout M3M Foundation\nThe Foundation’s strategic plan is rooted to support a diverse range of social activities across the nation. M3M Foundation through their thematic interventions is successful in transforming more than 1.8 million lives with the presence in 22 states, 3 union territories, 60 districts and more than 750 villages across India with collaboration and partnerships with state, central government and more than 15 civil society organisations.\nMashaal, born in 2021, the 5-year vision of the program is to continually support over 50 plus brilliant minds PAN India.",

    "title": "Boeing factory workers strike for first time since 2008 after overwhelmingly rejecting contract",
    "text": "More than 30,000 Boeing workers, members of the company’s biggest unionized group, walked off the job early Friday after staff rejected a new labor contract and approved a strike with a 96% vote. The work stoppage halts production of most of the company’s aircraft, including its bestselling 737 Max. The strike is another costly blow Boeing, which is trying to increase output and improve its reputation. Boeing ‘s factory workers walked off the job after midnight on Friday, halting production of the company’s bestselling airplanes after staff overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract.\nIt’s a costly development for the manufacturer, which has struggled to ramp up production and restore its reputation following safety crises.\nWorkers in the Seattle area and in Oregon voted 94.6% against a tentative agreement that Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers unveiled Sunday. The workers voted 96% in favor of a strike, far more than the two-thirds vote required for a work stoppage.\n“We strike at midnight,” said IAM District 751 President Jon Holden at a news conference where he announced the vote’s results. He characterized it as an “unfair labor practice strike,” alleging that factory workers had experienced “discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance and we had unlawful promise of benefits.”\nDavid Ryder | Reuters A worker holds a sign opposing the proposed contract as Boeing factory workers wait in line to vote on their first full contract in 16 years, at an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 union hall, in Renton, Washington, U.S. September 12, 2024. He said Boeing needs to bargain in good faith. Boeing didn’t comment on his claims.\n“The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” the company said in a statement. “We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.”\nStephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit, told machinists earlier this week that the tentative deal was the “best contract we’ve ever presented.”\n“In past negotiations, the thinking was we should hold something back so we can ratify the contract on a second vote,” she said Tuesday. “We talked about that strategy this time, but we deliberately chose a new path.”\nThe tentative proposal included 25% wage increases and other improvements to health-care and retirement benefits, though the union had sought raises of about 40%. Workers had complained about the agreement, saying it didn’t cover the increased cost of living.\nThe vote is a blow to CEO Kelly Ortberg , who has been in the top job for five weeks. A day before the vote, he had urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery.\nHow fixing airplane engines became a $58 billion business Low-cost airlines are turning away airplanes to cut costs Southwest shakes up board, chairman to step down next year amid activist pressure Under the tentative agreement, Boeing had promised to build its next commercial jet in the Seattle area, a bid to win over workers after the company moved the 787 Dreamliner production to a nonunion factory in South Carolina.\nThe agreement, if approved, would have been the first fully negotiated contract for Boeing machinists in 16 years. Boeing workers went on strike in 2008 for nearly two months.\nThe ultimate financial impact of this strike will depend on how long it lasts.\nJefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated a 30-day cash impact from a strike could be a $1.5 billion hit for Boeing and said it “could destabilize suppliers and supply chains.” She forecast the tentative agreement would have had an annual impact of $900 million if passed.\nM.

Boeing has burned through about $8 billion so far this year and has mounting debt. Production has fallen short of expectations as the company works to stamp out manufacturing flaws and faces other industrywide problems such as supply and labor shortages.\nAircraft delivery delays from Boeing have vexed its airline customers. In response, they said they have had to redraw their hiring and growth plans. Southwest Airlines has already sharply reduced its delivery expectations from Boeing for the year.\n“As a result, we currently have the fleet needed to fulfill our upcoming schedules,” a spokesman said Friday. The airline’s leaders were in touch with Boeing ahead of the vote.\nM.

    "text": "\"Drohnen-Lieferung an Ukraine: Russland greift westliche Firma an\"\nUkraine als Drohnen-Standort: Renault erwägt diesen Schritt. Russland übte daran scharfe Kritik. Und könnte den Autobauer als faschistisch einstufen.\nMoskau – Autokonzerne, die plötzlich in der Verteidigungsindustrie mitmischen, sind keine allzu neue Idee. Schon vor einigen Monaten hatte der CEO des Rüstungskonzerns Hensoldt erklärt, dass sein Unternehmen von den Schwierigkeiten in der Autobranche profitieren würde. Der französische Autohersteller Renault kehrt den Spieß um: Für ihn ist eine Produktion von Drohnen in der Ukraine möglich. Aus Russland kommt darum harsche Kritik.\nDuma-Politiker will Renault als faschistisch einstufen – wegen Drohnen-Bau in der Ukraine\nDas Renault-Symbol könnte bald in Russland als faschistisches Zeichen gelten – das schwebt jedenfalls Mikhail Scheremet vor, einem russischen Duma-Angehörigen. Der Grund dafür ist angeblich die geplante Zusammenarbeit zwischen Renault und ukrainischen Drohnenherstellern. Das Management von Renault müsse „wissen, dass die Ukrainischen Bewaffneten Kräfte (Ukrainian Armed Forces, UAF) ihre Drohnen dafür einsetzt, zivile Ziele zu beschießen und Zivilisten in russischen Regionen zu töten“, zitierte die Kyiv Post Scheremet dazu.\nAngesichts der vielen Tode unter ukrainischen Zivilisten und die gezielten Attacken Kiews auf russische Militäreinrichtungen ist die Aussage mindestens mit Vorsicht zu genießen. Bekommt Scheremet seinen Willen, sind die Fahrer von Renaults innerhalb Russlands jedoch womöglich gefährdet. Der Fernsehsender Nexta TV warnte davor, dass Russland (sollte Scheremets Vorschlag durchkommen) Strafzahlungen an Renault-Fahrer verhängen könnte. Die Wagen könnten außerdem konfisziert werden.\nRenault als Drohnen-Bauer – Details stehen noch aus\nWas steckt dahinter? Vor einigen Tagen gab Renault bekannt, dass der Automobilkonzern den Bau von Drohnen in der Ukraine erwägt. Das französische Verteidigungsministerium habe Renault dazu kontaktiert. So teilte es ein Unternehmenssprecher am Sonntag (8. Juni) der Nachrichtenagentur AFP mit. Eine Entscheidung sei allerdings noch nicht gefallen. Renault warte jetzt auf „weitere Präzisionen vonseiten des Ministeriums“.\nVorher ließ der Sender Franceinfo verlauten, dass Renault zusammen mit einem französischen Rüstungsunternehmen Produktionsstätten zum Drohnenbau errichten will. Diese sollen in „geringer Entfernung“ zur Frontlinie liegen.\nWeiter gab der französische Verteidigungsminister Sébastien Lecornu an, „ein großer französischer Autobauer“ werde sich in einer „völlig neuartigen Partnerschaft“ mit einem Rüstungsunternehmen zusammentun. Auch hier waren Produktionsstätten zum Drohnenbau das Ziel. Die produzierten Drohnen sollten dann an die ukrainische Armee geliefert werden. Französische Truppen würden diese Drohnen jedoch auch nutzen – für „taktische Übungen“.\nRückzug aus Russland – schon 2022 verkaufte Renault das Russland-Geschäft\nInwiefern das den Konzern betrifft, ist unklar – Renault hatte sich bereits 2022 aus Russland zurückgezogen. „Heute haben wir eine schwierige aber notwendige Entscheidung getroffen“, teilte der Konzern damals mit, und 100 Prozent der Anteile an Renault Russia, die die Renault Group gehalten hatte, an Moskau verkauft. Außerdem veräußerte der Konzern 67,69 Prozent des Anteils an AVTOVAZ an das Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute.",
