The noise is so blacked out that it's freaky. I had my siblings try it, and their faces were in shock when they realized they couldn't hear their kids yelling. Purchase these!

    "text": "\\nIt seems that Microsoft Edge is starting to plague servers with an error that blocks all traffic and renders the browser useless. An admin for a system and network organization on Reddit reported the issue: it initially happened on a single device, then spread to other devices from the organization, regardless of their Windows version (it happens on Windows 11 and Windows 10, as well).\n\\n\\nThe issue, labeled as Error code RESULT_CODE_KILLED_BAD_MESSAGE, happens on Microsoft Edge quite often, and there are solutions for it , but in this case, it seems those solutions are not working.\n\\nThe admin reported that clearing the cache, resetting the Edge settings, repairing the browser, or running it as another user doesn\\u2019t fix the issue. For now, the only solution is to open Edge in a sandbox, but seeing as it\\u2019s not a viable solution, migrating to Chrome for the time being seems reasonable.\n\\nThe issue doesn\\u2019t consider the version of Windows, as it can be any version of the latest Windows 11 or Windows 10. It also affects the private sessions of Microsoft Edge. The admin started noticing the issue on the most recent version of Microsoft Edge , released a few days ago.\n\\nSo what can those affected by this issue do?\n\\nFirst, you can try to enable/disable the compatibility mode in Microsoft Edge, as it can conflict with the current version. Follow our guide , restart Edge, and see if it works.\n\\nIt might also involve an external firewall, such as Fortigate. In that case, you\\u2019ll need to disable the flag called \\u2018TLS 1.3 post-quantum key agreement\\u2019 in edge://flags.\n\\nTo do that, access edge://flags , type the flag\\u2019s name above, and disable it .\n\\nDisabling the policy will no longer cause Microsoft Edge to block incoming traffic, allowing your devices to access the Internet safely and properly.\n\\nLet us know if these solutions worked for you.\n\\n",

    "title": "Some Muslim American advocates hesitant to work with White House on Islamophobia",
    "text": "The White House’s push to create a strategy to counter Islamophobia is facing reluctance amid a spike in hate-fueled incidents against Arab and Muslim Americans since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\nCBS News spoke with several Muslim and Arab American advocates who voiced frustration with the Biden administration’s response to the situation in Gaza, citing the increasing number of civilians that have been killed and President Biden stopping short of calling for a cease-fire.\nMuslim American advocate Salam Al-Marayati has worked with the Biden White House in the past. But despite the Biden administration’s efforts to craft a strategy to counter Islamophobia in the U.S., he’s skeptical about working with them in the future.\n“At this moment in time, it is very hard to even imagine how a national strategy to counter Islamophobia will work, Al-Marayati, the president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which is also a member of the American Muslim Community Coalition, told CBS News. “American Muslims here in the United States feel unsafe and unsupported as they witness the horrific attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Muslim families, students, and employees are afraid to speak out for fear of retribution as many who have spoken out have faced retaliatory action including loss of employment, suspension, censorship, trolling, bullying, and targeted violence.”\nPresident Joe Biden walks to the South Lawn before boarding Marine One and departing the White House on December 05, 2023 in Washington, DC. / Credit: Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images\nThe White House announced on Nov. 1 plans to develop a national strategy to counter Islamophobia, led by the Domestic Policy and National Security Councils. The proposal follows an announcement in May marking the federal government’s first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. Conversations and meetings on the development of the Islamophobia strategy date back a year, according to a senior administration official who said engagement with stakeholders in the community is ongoing with additional meetings scheduled for early next year. The effort is part of a White House interagency policy committee created in Dec. 2022 that focuses on countering antisemitism, Islamophobia and related types of discrimination.\n“[The development of the strategy] should be really welcome news. I think the challenge is given what’s going on and especially with the death toll and destruction rising and rising, people are understandably very hurt, angry, shocked [and] frustrated at America’s involvement in this,” said another source close to the discussions surrounding the development of the strategy. “And so the timing of these two different things overlapping even though they are totally separate is really challenging. And unfortunately I don’t know what will happen with the islamophobia strategy as a result.”\nWhile some have expressed doubts, others say it is important to continue work on ways to counter hate and solve systemic discrimination problems that have targeted the Arab and Muslim communities for decades.\n“We recognize, as do most other communities, that engaging on one issue doesn’t mean that you are endorsing or accepting the White House’s policies on that issue or any other issue,” said Arsalan Suleman, who is board chair and co-founder of America Indivisible, a nonprofit dedicated to combating Islamophobia. “So while I and many other community members have very strong criticisms of the current policy on Gaza, we certainly want to engage with the White House on the Islamophobia strategy, given its importance,” Suleman added.\nAdvocates say a plan to counter Islamophobia in the U.S. is necessary after a spike in anti-Muslim sentiment following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in Israel. But some question how effective the strategy could be and hesitate to take part in its development. A White House official told CBS News that administration officials are “listening” to the community and that the Biden administration remains committed to the development of a strategy.\n“We’ve had engagements where community members have engaged on the strategy and have also been able to make their points clear about their positions on what’s happening overseas in the course of those engagements while they’ve been focused primarily on the strategy,” a senior administration official said. CBS News spoke to the staffer on background to talk candidly about the ongoing development of the strategy. “We want to make sure that we are listening [and] so as a part of their communication with us, when they raise those issues, of course, we’re listening to them. And many have made the point that what’s happening overseas has an impact on what’s happening in the United States in terms of Islamophobia,” the official said.\nThe official insisted that support within the Arab and Muslim American community is strong, citing a letter from the American Muslim Community Coalition applauding the early November announcement.\n“We commit to participating actively in the process of supporting the development of the strategy, and look forward to a comprehensive approach that addresses the various drivers of Islamophobia, including deep-rooted institutional manifestations that have plagued our communities for decades,” the letter reads.\nThe White House hopes to complete its work on the strategy in late winter or spring.\nThe senior administration official also responded to criticism about the timing of the announcement explaining that the White House had planned to announce the development of the strategy well before the Hamas attack in October. Months of conversations and meetings with dozens of Muslim and Arab American groups pre-dated the attack, the official said. An increase in hate-fueled anti-Muslim incidents in the United States — including the deadly stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in the Chicago area — created a need to move forward with announcing the strategy, the official added.",

    "text": "Paul Purvis is an agronomist based at Elders Trangie and Warren in New South Wales. Paul has worked with Elders for over two years, supporting clients' broadacre cropping and pasture programs, with a focus on cotton.\nSince joining Elders, Paul has been working closely with one of the region's largest cotton growers, Agriland. His work is focused on their 1600-hectare cotton program, situated on their 8000-hectare farm located between Trangie and Narromine.\n\"In collaboration with Dubbo Agronomist Rochelle Field and Trangie Graduate Agronomist Bridgette Howe, we provide crop monitoring support throughout the seasons, increasing our level of support during key periods,\" Paul said.\n\"Agriland's operation is quite expansive, with us supporting the seasonal production cycle of the crop as before it goes to the nearby cotton gin operated by Australia Food and Fibre.\"\nPaul said that the season this year in the Central West tracked really well due to mild weather conditions and reasonable water availability.\n\"We experienced very mild conditions this year, with no periods of heat shock, low secondary insect pressures and efficient water availability, all leading to positive yield volumes,\" he said.\n\"Most growers completed harvesting by May, however some with larger crops faced delays due to significant rainfall. Remarkably, crops that remained in the field for five months during this wet period have shown promising yield and quality, a testament to the overall durability of cotton.\"\nIn a step that will allow for additional growth and capacities for future seasons in the region, an Elders fertiliser shed has been constructed on the same stretch of Agriland property.\n\"Customer feedback really highlighted the need for the facility,\" Paul said.\n\"We want to remain competitive and meet the needs of our loyal customers, without driving them to seek needed services elsewhere,\" Set to be operational this month, the fertiliser shed will benefit both the Elders business and customers alike.\n\"Our clients will now have the convenience of bulk purchasing and flexibility of accessing smaller quantities\" Paul said.\n\"In bad weather, delivery trucks can face challenges. Our prime location offers a safe drop-off point, straight off the highway, to combat these issues.\"\nThe Elders Warren branch, which opened its doors in April , has been well received by local residents with almost 100 attending the opening.\n\"We have young and enthusiastic staff at the branch, who are eager to establish themselves in the area and build long lasting client relationships,\" Paul said\n\"Our key point of difference for the area has been our diverse service offerings.\" \"The branch has been hosting information nights and events, enabling us to connect with clients involved in mixed cropping operations to foster strong, future business relationships.\"\nDisclaimer\nElders Ltd. published this content on October 03, 2024 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.

    "text": "Colin Blackwell had two goals and an assist and Nikita Zaitsev and Jarred Tinordi each contributed two points as the Chicago Blackhawks edged the visiting Calgary Flames 4-3 on Sunday to snap a five-game losing streak. Goaltender Petr Mrazek made 28 saves for Chicago, which was outshot 31-20. Nazem Kadri scored twice for the Flames, who lost for the second time in as many days. Blackwell scored the game-winner at 14:37 of the third period, beating Calgary goaltender Daniel Vladar with a wrist shot from the slot. Kadri answered with a goal just 42 seconds later, but the Blackhawks held on, navigating a late Flames flurry on a 6-on-5. Mrazek was especially effective on a Calgary power play midway through the third. Both teams were 1-for-3 on the man advantage. Calgary took a 2-1 lead on an Andrew Mangiapane power-play goal 3:26 into the second period. Mangiapane was credited with the tally thanks to a fortunate bounce, as his would-be pass ricocheted off a Blackhawk and into the net. The Blackhawks responded with two goals over a 2:40 span to take the lead. Philipp Kurashev scored to tie the game at 2 at 12:09 of the second, gathering the puck after a pass intended for him bounced off a Calgary defender and then wristing it into the net. Zaitsev beat Vladar at 14:49 when his slap shot just outside the right circle glanced off a Flames’ skate and in. Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists for Calgary. Vladar made 16 saves. Chicago managed just five shots on goal in the first period but made one of them count, as Blackwell beat Vladar with a wrist shot from the left circle to open the scoring 4:32 into the game. Kadri tied the game for Calgary just under nine minutes later. With Mrazek drawn out of the crease, Kadri scored on a tip-in following a crisp back-door pass from Noah Hanifin. Injury-ravaged Chicago, which placed star rookie Connor Bedard (fractured jaw) and fellow forward Nick Foligno (fractured left finger) on injured reserve Saturday, saw forward Zach Sanford make his team debut. Center Rem Pitlick, acquired Saturday in a trade with Pittsburgh, also was set to join the team, but inclement weather delayed his arrival. –Field Level Media More must-reads:",
