    "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Days after a [devastating fire](/article/news/local/two-alarm-fire-cobblestone-keybank-center/71-efe4e6f2-8925-4ebe-958d-cecb55b891ae) that damaged some historic structures in Buffalo's Cobblestone District, a member of the Common Council is still holding out hope they can be saved. Fillmore District Council Member Mitch Nowakowski was among those who spearheaded an effort by the city in recent years [to seize the buildings ](/article/news/local/buffalo/buffalo-cobblestone-buildings-faced-code-violations-for-years/71-bcc5072b-b154-498c-b8a6-e1bacc26968b)under eminent domain from an owner whom he claims neglected them, in hopes they could be adaptively reused. Then came Tuesday's fire. The buildings are under an emergency stabilization order in part so that fire inspectors can do their business to determine a cause. The future of the buildings after that is still undetermined. \"It's my overall intent to make sure the structures that can be save are, and that the structure is adaptively reused,\" Nowakowski told WGRZ-TV. But not at all costs. \"No, I have to be able to rely on the department of permits and inspections and the law department and the fire department to make those determinations if they can be salvageable or not,\" Nowakowski said. Part of what gives Nowakowski hope for the buildings, which are among the oldest in the city, is what he heard from some interested parties since the fire occurred. \"What surprised me was the amount of developers and the amount of people in the business community that said look we've done this before on other projects ... this could happen,\" Nowakowski said. 2 On Your Side left a message for one developer identified by Nowakowski, but we did not hear back from them by Friday evening. As hopeful as he may be that the buildings which were already abandoned and derelict prior to the fire could still be saved, he also said he would not stand in opposition to demolishing them if the city determines that's the best course in terms of public safety. \"I'm certainly not going to be out there being contrary,\" Nowakowski said. \"I have to rely on the expertise of those folks at city hall that are making those determinations.\"",

    "text": "La trágica historia de una madre en Gaza devastada por la guerra 6:45 (CNN) –– El director de un hospital en el norte de Gaza dijo que ya no pueden hacer frente a la afluencia de personas gravemente heridas y que tuvieron que trasladarlas a otro lugar.\nEl Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director del hospital Kamal Adwan en el norte de Gaza, le dijo a CNN este jueves que civiles gravemente heridos por un ataque aéreo israelí que tuvo lugar el miércoles contra una casa en el área de Beit Lahia no habían podido ser recibidos en el hospital. “Esos casos fueron trasladados a otro hospital por la falta de especialidades necesarias para el manejo de este tipo de lesiones”.\nBlinken afirma que Israel aceptó los términos de la retirada de Gaza en una\"propuesta puente\", a pesar de dichos de Netanyahu Muchos hospitales de Gaza carecen de personal y equipos después de diez meses de conflicto y la dificultad de acceso a gran parte de Gaza para las organizaciones de ayuda.\nAbu Safiya dijo que había escasez de combustible en Kamal Adwan.\n“Ahora estamos trabajando a la capacidad mínima en la prestación de servicios. La cantidad de combustible que tenemos no es suficiente para más de 24 horas”.\npublicidad Dijo que alrededor de una decena de niños están en diálisis o con ventiladores. \"La falta de combustible significa el fin de la vida de estos niños\".\nAbu Safiya dijo que el combustible llegaba en “cantidades que apenas alcanzan para unos días”.\nDijo que otro problema era la propagación de enfermedades, ya que los programas de vacunación se retrasaron debido al conflicto.\n\"Nos han llegado un gran número de enfermedades de la piel e infecciones intestinales (...) Es necesario reactivar las vacunas y tomar las muestras necesarias\".\nA principios de este mes, el Ministro de Salud del Gobierno Autónomo Palestino, el Dr. Majed Abu Ramadan, dijo que Gaza estaba “enfrentando un desastre humanitario en todos los sentidos de la palabra. La agresión ha provocado la destrucción de más del 80% de la infraestructura sanitaria y la mayoría de los hospitales están fuera de servicio”.\nRecuperan en Gaza los cadáveres de seis rehenes israelíes, según las FDI y la Agencia de Seguridad Israelí Ramadan dijo que los hospitales operativos “están funcionando parcialmente debido a los daños directos y la pérdida de personal médico calificado como consecuencia del desplazamiento forzado que enfrenta nuestro pueblo, así como a la falta de recursos, cortes de energía, escasez de combustible, falta de agua potable, alcantarillado, inundaciones, acumulación de desechos sólidos y propagación de epidemias”.\nEl Ministerio de Salud de Gaza informó el primer caso de polio la semana pasada, que atribuyó al desbordamiento de aguas residuales y a la falta de agua potable.\nDijo que \"se han completado los preparativos y arreglos para la campaña de vacunación para combatir la polio, dirigida a niños menores de 10 años, y la campaña está esperando la llegada de vacunas a Gaza\".",

    "text": "Savanah Nicole Soto, a pregnant teenager who disappeared before she was scheduled to be induced, is believed to have been found dead Tuesday following a dayslong search, police said. Her boyfriend was also found dead, police confirmed Wednesday. The two bodies were discovered in a vehicle in San Antonio, the city's police chief, Bill McManus, told reporters Tuesday evening, calling the case \"very, very perplexing.\" \"Detectives right now are looking at this as a possible murder, but we don't know for sure,\" McManus said. The bodies of an 18-year-old woman and 22-year-old man were found in a parked vehicle, each with a gunshot wound, police said Wednesday. An unborn child was also found deceased, police said. The medical examiner positively identified the male victim as Matthew Guerra, police said Wednesday night. Police are awaiting positive identification for the female victim. The victims' cause of death will be confirmed by the medical examiner, police said. They are believed to have been in the boyfriend's vehicle for three to four days, McManus said. The vehicle was found on the 5900 block of Danny Kaye Drive in northwest San Antonio, police said. McManus did not know who located it. Soto, 18, was last seen Friday afternoon in Leon Valley, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The agency issued a CLEAR Alert -- used to help law enforcement locate someone in imminent danger or whose disappearance is involuntary -- for Soto on Monday. The pregnant teen had passed her delivery date, which \"caused significant concern among her family members after missing an essential medical appointment,\" the Leon Valley Police Department said in a press release earlier on Tuesday. Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, told San Antonio ABC affiliate KSAT that her daughter was scheduled to be induced at a hospital this past Saturday. \"When I called her all morning she wasn't answering, was going straight to voicemail,\" Cordova told the station. \"We went to the hospital anyways. She was a no-show, and that's when I called the cops.\" Cordova said her daughter's home was clean and had been prepped for the baby's arrival. \"This is not like her,\" Cordova told KSAT. \"She was so excited to have this baby. The house was already baby-ready.\" \"There's no reason why she would just get up and go off and do that,\" she added. Cordova said the family is already reeling after her son, Ethan, died last year. The 15-year-old was fatally shot at his home in San Antonio, police said. \"[Savanah] knows what I went through with Ethan, and I know she doesn't want me to go through this again,\" the mother told KSAT. Amid the search for her daughter, Cordova said she did not know where the father of the baby was either. \"I just want her home,\" Cordova said. \"I'm worried about the baby, if she's even had the baby, if she's in danger.\" The Leon Valley Police Department said Tuesday morning that it was actively investigating Soto's disappearance and seeking additional witnesses and information. The San Antonio Police Department has taken over the investigation.",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Warrington Guardian",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

    "text": "The rise of AI in the construction sector was one of the major stories of the year in 2023, with the swift adoption of general artificial intelligence, machine learning and [ChatGPT](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2023/12/chatgpt-and-construction-join-the-party) in all facets of the industry only tempered by privacy concerns and, seemingly, the inability of humans to fully grasp its potential applications. Thirteen months ago, no one had heard of ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched Nov. 30, 2021; now, [advisers are cautioning constructors](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2023/10/insurance-essentials-how-contractors-and-builders-can-safely-use-artificial-intelligence) to show restraint as they upload endless company secrets into the public domain. The pages of the Daily Commercial News and Journal of Commerce followed the waves of enthusiasm almost weekly this year. In September, we quoted [James Barrett, chief innovation officer of Turner Construction](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2023/09/global-market-scan-helpful-ai-in-construction-on-an-upward-trajectory), as saying, “Artificial intelligence will transform our industry in the next 10 years more than any other technology in the past 100 years.” Three months later, Arash Shahi, CEO of LandLogic, compared the advent of AI to the Industrial Revolution. “We see AI doing the same thing,” he said. “In this digital revolution, you’re going to see a lot of tools that can make your data analytics jobs a lot easier, getting data accessible to the masses. That to me is the most important contribution.” Shahi was addressing a [Buildings Show audience in Toronto](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2023/12/simple-interfaces-a-key-to-ai-growth-in-construction-experts). The title of the presentation? AI, is the Hype Real? These days the Associated General Contractors of America is programming AI educational sessions and addressing members’ questions with heightened urgency. Brian Turmail, the AGC’s vice-president of public affairs and strategic initiatives, said in a year-end interview there is major curiosity – with some hesitation. “There’s a tremendous amount of interest and almost curiosity about the potential impact of AI on construction operations,” he said. “But I think it’s paired with a wariness, right? One of the things that a lot of firms need to think about is, if they start sharing their information on ChatGPT or other generative AI software tools, they need to understand that that data all of a sudden is now part of the public domain.” Anecdotes abound about new use cases for AI, with ChatGPT, the newest darling, dominating conversations. Some AGC members are using AI for employee conflict resolution and hiring conversations. It’s also helping prepare drafts of marketing and recruiting materials, said Turmail. “One member firm in South Florida is using artificial intelligence to help with a lot of the grunt work behind creating project estimates. And they argue that it takes about 70 per cent of the work out of the estimating process,” said Turmail. “There’s an expectation that we’ll see a lot more interaction with AI tools in 2024. But I would also temper that with, there’s an awful lot of stuff out there that’s being marketed as AI that really is just kind of the same algorithm-based tool that people were using two years ago.” In July, the [JOC talked with John McMullen of the Modular Building Institute in the U.S.](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2023/07/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-modular-and-pre-fab-construction), who said he’s sure AI will change the construction industry “forever.” “But don’t all new technologies do that?” says McMullen. “Electricity certainly did. Robotics and automation is making a huge impact now. It’s just a matter of leveraging these technologies to build better buildings and further cement the advantages of modular.” AI’s potential in modular is virtually unlimited, he said. “Building plans could be optimized for the capabilities of specific manufacturers,” he says. “The quality control and plan approval processes could radically change. Efficiencies could be found and implemented to reduce building times and material waste. The possibilities are endless.” In June, [Joe Geluch, president of Naikoon Contracting Ltd. in north Vancouver](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2023/06/nothing-phony-about-artificial-intelligence-in-construction), told the JOC that AI can be applied to skills training by quickly writing an instructional manual or creating a training video or online learning material. “Artificial intelligence might eliminate some outsourcing of specialized tasks, such as writing, graphic design and social media, and enable construction companies to do it themselves,” he says. “As a matter of fact, we’re piloting using AI to create graphic design now.” In November, [Lafarge Canada digital solutions architect Mahir Dheendsa](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/technology/2023/12/chatgpt-and-construction-join-the-party) addressed the hype, noting there are three main types of AI: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI). ChatGPT is ANI, given it has a very specific task to perform. Remarked Dheendsa, “It’s been said, the first company to achieve AGI will be the world’s first $10-trillion company.” Turmail’s best advice is to wade into AI with caution, learning its strengths and pitfalls. “Our advice to all firms is, absolutely you should understand what AI is, what its potential is. Right now, it’s primarily in the generative form in the sense that you can use it as a tool to spit out copy, to help to potentially document development and reporting. It’s an efficiency tool at this point,” he said. “But firms should be very aware of some of the proprietary challenges that come with putting their information into an open store, or tool like ChatGPT, and they should definitely be aware of the risks. They should also definitely be appreciating the fact that it’s a technology that’s changing rapidly.” In the end, Turmail said, make sure the learning process never stops.

    "title": "Alberta Premier Smith says legislation on school pronouns coming after September - Vancouver Is Awesome",
    "text": "EDMONTON — Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says her government will introduce legislation on pronouns in schools after classes begin in September. Smith said the new policy requiring parents to consent before children under 16 can change their names or pronouns in schools will be proposed in the fall legislature session that begins in late October. \"I don't want to presuppose what the outcome of those deliberations would be, but there will be lots of time to be able to get the policies in place and to implement them, so we have to make sure we have that robust discussion,\" Smith told an unrelated news conference on Thursday. Her comments come about three weeks before most kindergarten to Grade 12 schools open their classrooms. Smith said she intends to bring legislation forward for a suite of policies she first announced in January. Those include restricting transgender youth access to gender-affirming health care, banning transgender participation in female sports, and requiring parental consent or notification on sex education and changes to pronouns and names in schools. \"Once you've passed legislation, regulations have to be implemented,\" said Smith, who did not offer specifics about what enforcement would look like. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups Egale Canada and Skipping Stone Foundation have said if Alberta moves ahead with the proposed changes, they would bring legal action. Before Smith spoke on Thursday, the province’s two largest school divisions -- the Edmonton Public School Board and the Calgary Board of Education -- said they weren’t clear on what the province will implement and when those changes would arrive. On Wednesday, Alberta Teachers’ Association president Jason Schilling told The Canadian Press that his colleagues are incredibly worried about a chilling effect of new pronoun rules, even if the policy remains in limbo. \"It does definitely have a bit of a dark cloud hanging over things,\" he said, noting many teachers worry about being put in the position of having to decide whether to violate the trust and confidence of a student. \"They don't want to jeopardize the safety of a student who might trust them enough to share the struggles that they're going through,\" said Schilling. The issue has raised questions over whether Smith’s government would ultimately follow in the footsteps of Saskatchewan's government. Saskatchewan invoked the rarely used notwithstanding clause to override sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Saskatchewan's Human Rights Code for its pronoun legislation last fall. Schilling said if the Alberta premier did that, it would be \"a sledgehammer approach,\" and tone deaf. More pressing worries for teachers are a lack of educational assistants, and ballooning class sizes, he said. Critics have called Smith's moves an act of appeasement to her far-right United Conservative Party base ahead of a leadership review in early November, but Smith has said the issue of \"parental rights\" is important to her government. She has said she believes there’s nothing wrong with parents wanting to protect their \"child’s innocence as long as possible on issues of sexuality.\" Following Smith's announcement Thursday, Kristopher Wells, a Canada Research Chair for the public understanding of sexual and gender minority youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, wrote on social media that the premier's \"obsession\" with the transgender community is \"beyond weird.\" \"The fact that she ignores our crumbling health-care system to obsess over what parts people have in their pants is deeply disturbing. This trans panic she is manufacturing is hateful, hurtful and needs to stop,\" Wells wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Saskatchewan passed a law in October preventing children under 16 from changing their names or pronouns at school without parental consent. Dozens of teachers signed an online petition calling on school divisions not to follow the law. The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission has said invoking the notwithstanding clause significantly affects the rights of minors. Heather Kuttai, a former Saskatchewan human rights commissioner, resigned over the legislation, saying it assaults the rights of gender-diverse children. A report from Saskatchewan's child advocate said it violates rights to gender identity and expression. — With files from Jeremy Simes in Regina This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.
