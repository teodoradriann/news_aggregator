    "text": "La expresidenta interina de Bolivia Jeanine Áñez (2019-2020) sostuvo este jueves que Bolivia sigue el camino de la “tiranía consumada en Cuba, Nicaragua y Venezuela”, y consideró que el país es gobernado por el Tribunal Constitucional Plurinacional (TCP) con fallos “dictados” por la Administración de Luis Arce.\n“Bolivia está gobernada por un @TCPBolivia cuyos fallos son dictados en el Ministerio de Justicia”, escribió Áñez en la red social X.\nPara la exmandataria, el Constitucional es un tribunal “caducado y funcional al régimen del MAS”, el gubernamental Movimiento al Socialismo, “que ha prescindido de la Asamblea Legislativa siguiendo el camino de la tiranía consumada en Cuba, Nicaragua y Venezuela”.\nÁñez se pronunció de esta forma en medio del conflicto por la prórroga de mandato decidida por el TCP para sus propios magistrados y para los jueces de los otros máximos tribunales del país, a falta de las elecciones judiciales que debieron realizarse en 2023.\nLa preselección de candidatos está trabada desde el año pasado en el Parlamento nacional, que sigue sin ponerse de acuerdo para convocar al proceso electoral, aunque ahora una comisión bicameral y multipartidaria intenta elaborar una nueva ley para dar curso a los comicios judiciales.\nLa prórroga de los magistrados fue defendida por el Gobierno de Luis Arce que asegura que no es inconstitucional, mientras que los expresidentes Carlos Mesa (2003-2005) y Evo Morales (2006-2019) han criticado por separado la decisión del Constitucional.\nEn la víspera, Mesa, líder de la opositora Comunidad Ciudadana (CC), sostuvo que la prórroga supone la “instalación de una dictadura político-judicial” en la que el Gobierno de Arce decide “los destinos” de la oposición y la ciudadanía.\nTambién el miércoles el TCP emitió una resolución para que el Parlamento reconozca la prórroga antes de iniciar el tratamiento de la ley que convoque a las elecciones judiciales.\nAl respecto, Morales, que está distanciado del presidente Arce, consideró que los magistrados “autoprorrogados” están vulnerando la Constitución y sus acciones “cometen el delito de usurpación de funciones y son una amenaza para la democracia”.\nSectores afines a Evo Morales bloquean carreteras desde hace once días para exigir la renuncia de los magistrados y en rechazo a una sentencia del TCP que inhabilita al exmandatario como candidato presidencial al mencionar que la reelección indefinida “no es un derecho humano”, un argumento que usó para postular a los fallidos comicios de 2019.

    "text": "Does Garmin have the best GPS?\nGarmin is considered to have some of the best GPS technology available.

However, these drawbacks are often outweighed by the accurate tracking and reliable GPS functionality that Garmin offers.\nWhy are Garmin watches so expensive?\nGarmin watches are more expensive due to their premium materials and advanced technology. The watches are made with fiber-reinforced polymer, which is a high-quality and durable material. Additionally, Garmin invests in research and development to ensure their products meet the needs of athletes and fitness enthusiasts.\nWhy is Garmin so famous?\nGarmin gained popularity by integrating cockpit navigation devices into all-in-one designs, making navigation easier and more accessible. Over time, they expanded their GPS technology into wearable products for aviation, marine, automotive, outdoor, and fitness use. The reliability and accuracy of Garmin products have contributed to their fame.\nWhy don’t runners use Apple Watch?\nOne of the reasons why runners may not prefer Apple Watch is its limited battery life. Compared to other watches like Garmin Forerunner 265 or Polar Grit X, Apple Watch needs to be charged more frequently, which can be inconvenient for long-distance runners.
