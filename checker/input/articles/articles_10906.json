    "title": "Crossroads Initiative provides spaces for students to discuss politics before and after election",
    "text": "Crossroads Initiative provides spaces for students to discuss politics before and after election\nby Henry Meisner ’26, Staff Writer\nJust 30 days before the election, Dean Ngonidzashe Munemo announced Crossroads: Elections and Practicing the Liberal Arts. This initiative united a wide range of content of cross-discipline programming under the Crossroads label with the intention of providing a space for students to express their thoughts and opinions on the upcoming election. In the aftermath of the election, the Crossroads programming will continue to provide spaces for students to discuss politics and practice the liberal arts.\n“The core of it was really around thinking through and working with colleagues across campus on a broad initiative to try and get the campus community to engage with the elections, that wasn’t the kind of traditional, passive, we’re just going to have talks about it,” Dean Munemo told The Spectator. He continued, saying the core question behind the initiative is, “how do we take advantage of the liberal arts context to engage with the elections?”\nCrossroads programming provided many ways for students to express their ideas leading up to the election. This included tabling on Martin’s Way, various Common Ground events, lectures across a variety of departments, late-night breakfasts at Commons and McEwen and a community mural. Crossroads programming centralized typically separate, but similar, events. Dean Munemo said about this intertwining, “We don’t often see that as a kind of cohesive set.”\nLecture style events were blended with interactive events for student expression. According to Dean Munemo, “A lot of people are going to come and talk at you, so I was mostly focused on the individual engagement with the elections.” Days-Massolo Center Director Koboul Mansour expanded on this point, saying, “You’re somebody who just came out of your hometown or your family, and you’re being shaped and reshaped and formed and reformed by all the experiences that you get exposed to along the way. So how can you do that as students if you do not have the space to express yourself, you know what I mean?”\nOf these programs, Dr. Mansour and Dean Munemo found the tabling on Martin’s Way to be the most impactful. Dean Munemo told The Spectator, “A common theme [that we found] was that, certainly among students for the most part, they weren’t really talking with each other about the elections.”\nIn these conversations, Dr. Mansour found that conservative students tended to be worried about expressing their political beliefs. In an interview with The Spectator, she said, “When conversations came up about elections, one of the things that happened a few times was … you would see a group of friends walking with each other. … And some students actually walked by us, and then they came back alone, saying that they would love to talk about the elections and, like, how they feel about it and everything. But they didn’t feel comfortable sharing their views because they didn’t want their friends to think less of them.”\nHowever, despite its success in bringing community members together, Crossroads programming was not without setbacks. On Oct. 10, the Crossroads community mural was vandalized by Adyn Brenden ’27, as previously reported by The Spectator. This vandalism included several swastikas and a call to violence against Jewish people. After the vandalism was discovered, the canvas was immediately scrubbed and shut down. Brenden, a South Dakota native, is currently suspended from campus and awaiting trial set for this January. Brenden commented on his actions on popular social media network X.\nRecounting this experience, Dean Munemo said, “when I heard about the vandalism, my commitment was I need to figure out a way to get back, to not let that incident take away from the engagement that, clearly, members of the community had found inspiration in.” In spite of the vandalism, the mural was brought back after a week and eventually displayed in collaboration with the Wellin.\nCrossroads programming will continue on after the election to help students engage with democracy. According to Dean Munemo, topics for the new chapter of Crossroads will answer the question “what can we do that takes advantage of the fact that we are a residential liberal arts college:” engaging in local politics, writing op-eds and contacting members of Congress.\nExpanding on what these programs may look like in the future, Dr. Mansour explained, “One of [the projects] is called The Empathy Project. … It’s an interactive theater that actually happens over the course of eight weeks, where you pair students up and you do casting and all. It’s a whole like, you know, theater production situation, but the whole point is to pair two humans together. And then they will have to learn about each other and what they think. And then for the final production, they go on a stage, and they actually present each other’s point of view.”\n“The final thing I would somewhat want to add is a deep and sincere thank you to the colleagues who made this possible. I had got kind of this crazy idea, but the idea would have not gotten anywhere without students, faculty, and staff across campus who were willing to indulge my idea. Among those that were incredibly helpful, the events office, Lisa Magnarelli and her team, just the tremendous, tremendous partnership in collaboration with Koboul Mansour, the director of the Days-Massolo Center, whose vision and execution of this was incredible. … So a lot of thank yous to the community and the working group for the engagement,” said Dean Munemo after recounting his experiences with the initiative.\n“I think it’s one of the hardest things you could possibly do as a human is to try to engage everyone in a conversation about a very polarizing topic, and this is a very extensive one, for a lot of different reasons,” Dr. Mansour told The Spectator. She continued, “I honestly believe that if we just try to save our humanity at the level that we can, that’s going to be a huge win for everyone, and I think this campaign was able to do that, bring a lot of campus community members, regardless if you’re a student, you’re in facilities, you’re whatever, to engage about something that’s very sensitive.”",

    "title": "Rashee Rice stars in Chiefs' victory despite subzero temperature - ABC News",
    "text": "Rashee Rice stars in Chiefs' victory despite subzero temperature KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Rookie wide receiver [Rashee Rice](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice) is from Dallas and played in college at SMU, so he's never played a game in weather remotely approaching that from Saturday night's [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs) wild-card playoff game at Arrowhead Stadium. Rice looked like a natural with the temperature at minus 4 degrees at kickoff, the fourth-coldest playoff game in NFL history. Rice had 130 receiving yards, sixth most by a rookie in the playoffs, and a touchdown on eight catches as the Chiefs advanced to next week's divisional round with a 26-7 win over the [Miami Dolphins](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins). \"I feel like, to be honest, it was another game,'' Rice said. \"Everybody out here was playing for each other, so it was just like we just put the weather to the side and knew that our opponents didn't want to be out here in this cold as much as we didn't.'' The Chiefs, who led the league during the regular season in dropped passes and were among the leaders in turnovers, played a relatively clean game given the circumstances. They had a couple of drops, but were able to overcome them each time. They didn't commit a turnover until running back [Clyde Edwards-Helaire](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242214/clyde-edwards-helaire) fumbled in the final minutes as the Chiefs were merely trying to kill the clock. [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes) was 23-of-41 for 262 yards and had an 11-yard scoring toss to Rice, who ran a shallow crossing route, caught the short pass and ran untouched to the end zone. \"The guys accepted the challenge,'' Mahomes said. \"We were able to throw the ball, we were able to run the ball. ... I thought the [offensive] line did a great job and we had that mentality all week that we're going to go out there and play football. We know it's cold, but we're going to go out there and play football and see what happens.'' The Dolphins tried complicating those efforts by blitzing Mahomes at a rate he's rarely seen. He faced six or more pass-rushers 14 times, the most of his career. He saw five or more rushers on 51.2% of his dropbacks, which was tied for the highest rate of his career. But Mahomes wasn't sacked and he didn't commit a turnover. \"I don't think they were anticipating us throwing the ball quite as much as we did, but we were able to come out and sling it,'' coach Andy Reid said. \"A lot of quarterbacks can't do that, what he did in that kind of weather.'' Rice was the Chiefs' leading wide receiver during the regular season by a wide margin. He improved as the season progressed and twice went for more than 100 yards in his final six games. \"Some of those guys hit that rookie wall and it seems like he just kind of pushed right through it and he's just continued to get better and better and he's a great player,'' Mahomes said. \"He has that right mentality. He comes to work every single day and he made a lot of great plays for us today that helped us win the football game.'' The rest of the Chiefs' wide receivers struggled much of the season. They were counting on significant production from [Kadarius Toney](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240600/kadarius-toney), [Marquez Valdes-Scantling](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051738/marquez-valdes-scantling) and [Skyy Moore](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430191/skyy-moore) but got it from none of them so Rice's emergence was essential. Tight end [Travis Kelce](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce) caught seven passes against the Dolphins. Otherwise, none of their receivers had more than two catches. \"It's hard to believe that he's a rookie,'' Reid said of Rice. \"The best part about him is he just keeps working. He's relentless with that and he's got a good relationship [with Mahomes]. He's got Pat's respect and he wants to do it the right way. \"He's getting better every week and so I think we've seen that the last four games, five games.''",

It was just a distraction by the premier to try to shift to something else, and to try to give her a bit of credit — to his embattled minister.\"\nLater on Thursday, the office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a news release confirming that Macron would visit New Brunswick this year \"to deepen the bilateral relationship\" between Canada and France and \"promote shared priorities.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",
