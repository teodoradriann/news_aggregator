    "text": "Congress criticises BJP for 'politicising' Ram Temple ceremony [PTI](/pti-stories)| Pathanamthitta | Updated: 29-12-2023 17:51 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 17:51 IST - Country: - India Amidst indecision within the party over the invitation extended to its top leaders to attend the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the Congress on Friday criticised the BJP, alleging that the saffron party was turning the religious event into a party programme. AICC General Secretary in charge of organisation K C Venugopal said that senior Congress leaders, including Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, have been invited to the Ram Temple consecration ceremony, and added that they would decide at an ''appropriate time'' whether to attend it. Talking to reporters, Venugopal said the senior leaders have received a personal invitation for the January 22 function. ''They will take a stand on their own. It's not a matter in which we have to express our opinion in public. They will take a stand when the time comes,'' Venugopal said. He noted that the Congress party has a clear-cut stand on such matters, and it functions accordingly. ''We will express our stand after discussing in our party forums and take a decision,'' he added. Venugopal criticised the BJP government, questioning ''whether it was right to turn such an event into a function of a party or a government''. His reaction came amid increasing uncertainty within the Congress regarding the political stance on the invitation for its national leadership to attend the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple. Besides Gandhi and Kharge, the party's leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has also been invited. The CPI(M) has already declared that its representatives will not attend the ceremony, calling it a political move by the BJP ahead of the general elections that are to be held in a few months. The Ram Temple in Ayodhya is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 22. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and more than 6,000 people are expected to attend the grand 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony.

El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992)\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\n[#13](c13#c-13) Se financian infinitud de proyectos e ideologías en los 5 continentes, para bien y para mal, y solo los “amigos de las cabras” son los que a posteriori se dedican al terrorismo.\n[#56](c56#c-56) con lo de los amigos de las cabras supongo q te refieres a los valerosos guerreros muyahidines, que junto a los USA liberaron del yugo comunista a Afganistán y lo convirtieron en la tierra de libertades que es hoy. No? O te refieres a las primaveras árabes? O a liberar libia? Iraq? El maidan de Ucrania?\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Reagan murió hace 20 años y dejó la presidencia hace 35... De verdad tu argumento más solido es usar una foto de hace 40 años? Alguna prueba que adjuntar a la afirmación de la financiación de EEUU y UK a los culpables de este atentado?\nAcaso guarda alguna relación Reagan reuniéndose con los muyahidines hace 40 años con este atentado en Nigeria y yo no me he enterado?\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nEstos terroristas de Nigeria? Un pelín racista por tu parte hacer un batiburrillo basándote únicamente en que son integristas musulmanes.",

    "title": "NASA Bridges the Gap Between High Fashion and Space Exploration with New Prada-Designed Spacesuits",
    "text": "From runway chic to the future of space mechanical engineering, Italian fashion house Prada has unveiled new designs for the next generation of spacesuits. In partnership with space industry leaders Axiom Space, the atypical collaboration is now helping NASA bridge the gap between high fashion and space exploration by creating new spacesuits for the forthcoming Artemis III lunar mission. Scheduled for a targeted launch in September of 2026, the Artemis III lunar mission will mark the first time a woman and a person of color will set foot on the Moon in the first crewed lunar exploration since December 1972. Outside of fashion, diversity, and culture, the NASA mission aims to land astronauts near the lunar South Pole , helping to push the goal forward of creating a long-term human presence on the moon and helping to prepare for similar explorations of Mars in the years ahead. NASA is no stranger to working with patterns designed with women in mind. The first modern spacesuit was crafted by a group of designers at the International Latex Corporation (ILC), best known for fabricating and constructing bras and girdles in the 1960s. First worn by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission, designers created the A7L to protect astronauts from the harsh conditions of space and the lunar surface. The A7L spacesuit used materials such as neoprene, Beta cloth (designed to protect astronauts from high temperatures), and aluminized mylar. It was a complicated spacesuit design with several layers to ensure protection, motility, and pressure. Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, said in a statement that “Going beyond our limits is one of the company’s values that perfectly reflects the spirit of the Prada brand and my parents’ vision.” “I’m very proud of the result we’re showing today, which is just the first step in a long-term collaboration with Axiom Space,” Beretlli added. “We’ve shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot.” “I’m sure we’ll continue to explore new challenges, broaden our horizons, and build new scenarios together,” Bertelli said. The first look at the new spacesuit designs was revealed at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan and presented to the public on October 18, with a fashion installation at the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II as an extension of the IAC event. “Our elite teams have redefined spacesuit development, establishing new pathways to innovative solutions and applying a state-of-the-art design approach for the AxEMU,” said Matt Ondler, Axiom Space President, in a press release. “We have broken the mold. The Axiom Space-Prada partnership has set a new foundational model for cross-industry collaboration, further expanding what’s possible in commercial space.” With the help of Prada’s knowledge and innovation in raw materials and designs alongside the experience of the Axiom Space team, the first human exploration of the lunar south pole will bring NASA and space tourism enthusiasts around the globe closer to traveling the cosmos in style. “We are pioneering a new era in space exploration where partnerships are imperative to the commercialization of space,” said Russell Ralston, Executive Vice President of Extravehicular Activity, Axiom Space. “Partnerships build a strong, cohesive team, enabling industry experts to provide cutting-edge technology, specialized products, and services to drive innovation.” “For the first time, we are leveraging expertise in other industries to craft a better solution for space.” Chrissy Newton is a PR professional and founder of VOCAB Communications.

    "title": "Video: MSNBC Says Rights Come from Government, Not God, and You’re a Christian Nationalist if You Think Otherwise",
    "text": "Last Updated on February 23, 2024 An MSNBC panelist on the All In with Chris Hayes program claimed that the rights of Americans don’t come from God, but rather from the federal government, specifically naming Congress and the Supreme Court as the arbiters of human rights. Those who echo America’s Founding Fathers in believing that human rights come from God and not man, are Trump-aligned Christian Nationalists, she said. Politico reporter Heidi Przybyla, who has obsessively reported on her own [claims](https://web.archive.org/web/20240223092051/https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/20/donald-trump-allies-christian-nationalism-00142086) that Christian Nationalists are preparing to seize control of the United States, appeared this week on MSNBC’s All In program, which was being guest hosted by Michael Steele, a failed RNC Chairman and anti-Trumper. While there, Przybyla claimed that the rights of Americans, and all human beings for that matter, do not come from God, but instead come from the government. “The one thing that unites all of them, because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump, the thing that unites them as Christian Nationalists, not Christians by the way because Christian Nationalism is very different, is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority,” Przybyla said. Christian Nationalists, she went on, believe that their basic rights “don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court, they come from God.” Hear the Remarks in the [Video Clip](https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1761015125673222572) Below: Here [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] — Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [February 23, 2024] The absurd remarks from Heidi Przybyla come as Christ-hating uni-party members launch an all-out anti-Christian offensive against Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, as Christian Americans, and other people of faith, including Muslims, finally begin standing up to the radically globalist, pro-trans, pro-usury ruling class. At a recent rally in Tennessee, 45th President Trump pledged to establish a new task force to fight anti-Christian bias, and vowed that “No one will be touching the Cross of Christ under the Trump administration.” Trump also told supporters who gathered at the Nashville rally, a city in which a trans terrorist slaughtered 6 Christians, including 3 children last year, that the renewed Trump Administration “will protect God in our public square.”",

    "text": "The legal battle between the [Carmelite nuns](http://www.carmelnuns.com/index.html) of the Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity and Bishop Michael Olson may be over after a second lawsuit was dismissed on Wednesday, but another fight involving orders from the Vatican over who has authority over the nuns is brewing. On Wednesday and Thursday, a representative appointed by Rome was turned away when she tried to enter the monastery to deliver letters from the Vatican to the nine cloistered nuns. They do not want to be governed or managed by the Association of Christ the King, the Carmelite order appointed to govern and manage operations of the monastery, according to the Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth. kAmp DA@ 2:=[ “%96 s:@46D6 5@6D ?@E 2EE6C 36EH66?
