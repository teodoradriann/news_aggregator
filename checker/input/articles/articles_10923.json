    "title": "Thank God The 2026 Mercedes-AMG CLE 63 Has A Roaring V8",
    "text": "The next Mercedes CLE 63 ditches hybrid complications, bringing back the V8 power fans have been craving. Spy shots reveal lightly disguised prototypes of the high-performance model, including two coupes and a convertible. Mercedes may offer a second powertrain for the CLE 63 alongside the V8, possibly introducing a plug-in hybrid option. Update 10/17: Mercedes has begun peeling off the layers of disguise on its 2026 AMG CLE 63 prototypes, giving us our clearest look yet at what’s to come. Our spies have caught not one, but three different cars out in the wild—two coupes and a convertible sporting a classic cloth top. Along with a slew of fresh spy shots, we’ve also got new info to share. Scroll down for the latest updates as we piece together the puzzle of Mercedes’ next big AMG.\nPhotos Baldauf The current Mercedes-AMG C63 S may boast 671 hp and torque that could theoretically tilt the Earth’s axis, but let’s not pretend the switch from a V8 to a turbocharged four-cylinder plug-in hybrid didn’t ruffle some feathers. Purists cried foul. Apparently, it seems that AMG got the memo with the upcoming CLE 63. This time, they’re not messing around by downsizing the engine and upsetting their fanbase.\nA few months back, our spy photographers caught the new CLE 63, which could arrive as a 2026MY, doing what every proper AMG should do—lapping the Nurburgring with fury. At the time, we only had visual proof. Well, that’s changed. Several CLE 63 prototypes have now been filmed up close in Europe, and the noise doesn’t lie. There’s a thumping, unmistakable V8 growl under the hood.\nRead: Mercedes-AMG CLE 63 Could Pack A Twin-Turbo V8 Punch\nWhile specific details about the V8 in these prototypes aren’t known, it’s widely expected to be the latest version of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo unit the carmaker has been using for several years now. If you’re familiar with this engine, the soundtrack alone will take you back; it has the throaty, unapologetic rumble that the four-cylinder C63 could only dream of.\nThe existing Mercedes-AMG SL 63 rocks this same engine and produces 577 hp and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) of torque. That may be significantly less than the 671 hp and 752 lb-ft (1,018 Nm) of the C63, but it’s still plenty of power. While we’d like to see AMG’s engineers tweak this engine for use in the CLE 63 to over 600 hp, there’s no guarantee that’ll happen.\nNevertheless, the lack of a visible charging port on any of these prototypes suggests that the V8-powered models may skip any heavy-handed hybridization. That said, a mild-hybrid system is still on the table, which would improve efficiency without diluting the V8 experience.\nA Second 4-Cylinder Powertrain Option?\nThere’s also been speculation that the new CLE 63 might come with a second powertrain option , offering a choice for buyers who can’t quite make up their minds between old-school muscle and cutting-edge tech. Rumor has it that this variant could wear the E-Performance badge, potentially packing a plug-in hybrid setup similar to the one found in the C63 S E Performance .\nIn that model, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is paired with a rear-mounted electric motor, a 6.1 kWh battery, and a fully variable all-wheel-drive system. When everything’s working in concert, this setup churns out a ridiculous 671 hp (500 kW / 680 PS) and a mind-boggling 752 lb-ft (1,018 Nm) of torque.\nSuch an option might sound, let’s say, peculiar to purists—after all, who wants to trade V8 thunder for four-cylinder hums and electric assistance? But for those willing to embrace the hybrid future, this setup would offer a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. It’s a fascinating, if divisive, direction for AMG.\nWhen Will It Arrive?\nAs for when we’ll actually see the new CLE 63 in all its V8 glory (and possibly, its PHEV sidekick)? That’s still a mystery. Mercedes has been playing their cards close to the chest on this one, but we suspect the reveal will come sometime in 2025. Until then, all we can do is keep an ear out for more details—or, better yet, more glorious V8 growls from those prototypes.\nPhotos Baldauf",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Yamhill County, Oregon from 1901-2000 was 39.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Yamhill County, Oregon experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Yamhill County, Oregon history.",

    "text": "CLEARFIELD — High winds, snow squalls and ice made for a treacherous commute for those around the area early Thursday morning and there were an abundance of accidents.\nMultiple accidents took place Thursday morning, with Interstate 80 being one of the biggest issues that in turn compounded traffic congestion elsewhere.\nOn Interstate 80 specifically, Timothy Nebgen, press officer for the state Department of Transportation District 2-0 office, said a 45 miles-per-hour speed limit restriction was implemented between the Penfield (mile marker 111) and Kylertown (133) exits shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday — that was then extended to the Bellefonte (161) exit.\nThe westbound lanes of I-80 were closed between the Kylertown (133) and Clearfield-Shawville (120) exits at approximately 5:30 a.m. following multiple crashes in that area.\nAccording to various fire company social media posts, assisting those at the accident scenes Thursday included Bigler-Jackson-Woodland Fire Company, Clearfield Fire Dept., Hyde Fire Co., Lawrence Twp. Fire Co., Morris Twp. Fire Co., Winburne Fire Co. and Grassflat Fire Co.\nNebgen said a detour was then used featuring state Route 53, SR 2030 — also known as the Allport Cutoff, and U.S. Route 322.\n“A secondary crash within the detour route then led to delays and significant traffic backlogs as traffic tried to reconnect with I-80 at the Clearfield-Shawville interchange,” Nebgen said.\nOne lane was then opened back up on the westbound lane around 7:30 a.m. and as of 4 p.m. Thursday, it was still restricted to a single lane as Nebgen stated recovery operations continued. Speed limit restrictions were then lifted at 9 a.m.\nArea school districts of Clearfield, Philipsburg-Osceola, West Branch and Moshannon Valley started out with two-hour delays. However, all but Mo Valley then closed.\nWest Branch, located on the Allport Cutoff, posted on its Facebook page that, at the time of announcing the school closure, traffic was backed up from its building to the Bigler intersection — a stretch of highway a little over five miles long.\nNebgen also stated PennDOT offers the following advice if motorists must travel and they encounter snow squalls, blowing or drifting snow.\n- Slow down gradually and drive at a speed that suits conditions.\n- Turn on your headlights. If caught in a snow squall, turn on your hazard lights.\n- Stay in your lane and increase your following distance.\n- Stay alert, keep looking as far ahead as possible and be patient.\n- Do not drive distracted; your full attention is required.\n- Use your defroster and wipers.\n- Keep windows and mirrors free of snow and ice.\n- During whiteouts, come to a complete stop only when you can safely pull off the roadway.\n- Do not stop in the flow of traffic since this could cause a chain-reaction collision.\n- Do not pass a vehicle moving slowly or speed up to get away from a vehicle that is following too closely.\n- Always buckle up and never drive impaired.\nMotorists are also reminded that if a crash occurs due to or during a snow squall and they are involved or stopped due to the crash:\n- In most cases, you are safer in your vehicle with seat belts fastened.\n- If possible, drive slowly to the front of the pileup and get off travel lanes.\n- If you must leave your car for an emergency, try to wait until it looks safe.\n- Do not stand outside your vehicle on or near the roadway.",

    "text": "Cryptocurrency re-surfaced with force in 2023, after a dismal two-year covid performance, reaching all-time high Bitcoin (BTC) prices of more than US$35,000.\nToday, Bitcoin is trading at more than US$42,000 at a maximum supply of 21 million coins, and there are predictions it could surge to new heights in 2024.\nBut what happened this year to propel this industry?\nThe Market Herald has compiled a list of some of the biggest stories to headline the crypto industry in 2023, with expert commentary from Investment Analyst Matthew Harcourt from cryptocurrency investment company\nApollo Crypto.\nMr Harcourt delves into the news headlines, trends and precedents that have set the trajectory for the industry as it heads into 2024.\nRegulatory landscape\nCrypto assets run on a technological platform known as a\nblockchain, enabling investors to confirm transactions without needing clearance from a central finance authority.\nThe platform itself is highly unregulated, however, this year there’s been heavy talk on how it can be regulated to increase financial security across the board.\nIn October this year, Australia saw some action with the Federal Government’s release of a proposal paper outlining recommendations to\nenhance the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n“Going into 2024, the regulatory crackdown is likely to shift from centralised exchanges to decentralised exchanges…,” Mr Harcourt explained.\nCentralised exchanges are controlled by one major entity, which means faster transactions and easier use. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers for higher liquidity.\nDecentralised exchanges offer lower transaction fees and allow users to hold onto their crypto assets, meaning they can avoid some of the regulatory burdens already in place.\n“…a little bit of worry is in the market about the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) trying to apply the old rule of law to these completely new technologies and businesses to sort of better their interests – which is pretty much what they did with centralised exchanges throughout this year…,” Mr Harcourt said.\nMr Harcourt said the crypto industry was geared to experience continual regulatory clarity from leading jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Europe and parts of the Middle East in 2024.\n“I suspect that the U.S. will continue to fight the industry and push innovation off-shore -as has been the trend for years,” he predicted.\nGrayscale and the SEC\nThis year, the world’s largest crypto asset manager,\nGrayscale, took the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the rejection of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe legal dispute concluded with the SEC instructed to discard its initial rejection grounds. Grayscale emerged victorious, securing approval to launch the ETF.\nThe anticipated debut for the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF is now slated for January 2024, marking the first substantial deadline for filing denial.\n“Grayscale’s win in court shows that when the rule of law is fairly applied, the SEC will not be able to use its overwhelming power and resources in an unfair way,” Mr Harcourt said.\n“Going forward, it shows that the SEC will need to operate more fairly with the crypto industry as they will not be able to bully the industry the same way when in court.”\nCrypto crime crackdowns\nThe SEC has had its victories too.\nThis year, one of the wealthiest individuals to ever grace the crypto industry experienced his downfall. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on fraud charges concerning his FTX crypto exchange.\nHis empire crashed in November 2022 at a value of $40 billion, along with his Alameda Research trading firm, forcing Mr Bankman-Fried to file for bankruptcy.\nMr Bankman-Fried is serving a maximum sentence of 115 years in a US prison.\nWithin weeks of that decision, the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was fined $50 million and stepped down as CEO after pleading guilty in a Washington District Court to violating US federal law.\nMr Zhao violated laws that require financial institutions to guard against money laundering and terrorist financing. He’s due to be sentenced early next year.\nBinance as a company pleaded guilty to wilfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act, knowingly failing to register as a money transmitting business, and willfully violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\nThe US Department of Justice alleged its platform accommodated criminals across the world who used Binance to move their stolen funds and other criminal proceeds.\n“Binance enabled nearly $900 million in transactions between U.S. and Iranian users,”\nThe Department of Justice Attorney General Merrick Garland reported.\n“And it facilitated millions of dollars in transactions between U.S. users and users in Syria and the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.\n“For example, between August 2017 and April 2022, there were direct transfers of approximately $106 million in bitcoin to Binance.com wallets from Hydra, Hydra was a popular Russian darknet marketplace, frequently utilised by criminals, that facilitated the sale of illegal goods and services.\n“From February 2018 to May 2019, Binance processed more than $275 million in deposits and $273 million in withdrawals from Bestmixer. Bestmixer was one of the largest cryptocurrency anonymizing services in the world before it was shut down for money laundering.\n“Binance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law – it pretended to comply.\n“The message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal.\n“The Justice Department is requiring Binance to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and forfeiture.”\nSun charges hit celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan\nEarlier, in March, the SEC announced charges against crypto asset entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his companies, Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation and Rainberry, for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT).\nThe SEC also charged Sun and his companies with fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX through extensive wash trading, involving simultaneous, or near-simultaneous, buying and selling of a security, so it seems actively traded without an actual change in ownership. Interestingly it also laid charges around orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation.\nThe SEC simultaneously charged the following eight celebrities for illegally touting the securities without disclosing their compensation – those celebrities included Lindsay Lohan. She was ordered to repay the US$10,000 she was paid to promote Sun’s TRX and BTT to her 8.4 million Twitter, or X, followers, plus a US$30,000 penalty.\nRecent reports suggest some platforms that Sun backed, including exchange HTX, had been hacked for well over US$100.\nSEC keeping watch\nWhen asked about his main concerns regarding crypto crime heading into 2024, Mr Harcourt said there were others in the industry that the SEC would be watching. For one, it has been trying to serve a lawsuit against Hex and PulseChain Founder Richard Heart.\n2024 predictions\nWhile Mr Harcourt said there was no way to know for certain if Bitcoin would edge even higher in 2024, the strong support for a Bitcoin ETF suggests the market is poised to see some positive action.\n“…if the macro picture stays favourable…I do think you’re going to get strong price action in Bitcoin and then that will flow onto the crypto market more broadly,” he said.\nMr Harcourt emphasised that Bitcoin ETFs could be a catalyst for institutional adoption, as they boast easy, safe and accessible investment characteristics for large companies.\nInternational crypto giant BlackRock also joined the ETF industry with an Ethereum fund under its iShares Ethereum Trust division. This was confirmed in early November through a listing on the NASDAQ.\n“…at the moment, there’s there’s a lot of hurdles from these internal compliance perspectives and so an ETF that’s created by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world … there’s no lower barrier to entry into buying Bitcoin than that institution, essentially,” he continued.\nLastly, Mr Harcourt touched on the utilisation of blockchain technology, by banks through what’s known as tokenisation. Tokenisation is the blockchain digital representation of assets.\n“Going forward you may start to see competition from other banks heating up in the tokenisation space, banks will also look to become crypto custodians,” he said.",

    "title": "Rodri: \"Creo que España ha merecido ganar el Balón de Oro, pero en nuestra mejor época estaban Cristiano y Messi...\" | Deportes | Cadena SER",
    "text": "[Fútbol](/deportes/futbol/) Rodri: \"Creo que España ha merecido ganar el Balón de Oro, pero en nuestra mejor época estaban Cristiano y Messi...\" El centrocampista del City repasa en 'BBC Sport' la Eurocopa de España, la Champions ganada en 2023 y la lista del Balón de Oro En la misma semana en la que ha sido nominado entre los 30 jugadores candidatos al Balón de Oro, Rodri ha pasado por BBC Sport para charlar con el exportero Joe Hart sobre sus últimos éxitos en el mundo del fútbol: ganar la Champions en 2023, la Eurocopa de España este pasado verano y el propio galardón entregado por France Football. El jugador del City, que ha sumado 26 goles y asistencias esta temporada como mediocentro defensivo, considera que \"un español debería ganar el Balón de Oro\" en este 2024, en el aparece nominado junto a Carvajal, Lamine Yamal, Grimaldo, Olmo y Nico Williams. Ganar la Champions en 2023 El jugador español ha repasado lo complicado que es ganar un trofeo como la Champions League, conquistada por el Manchester City ante el Inter en 2023 con un gol de sus botas. \"Es una competición distinta. Creo que es muy complicada, porque necesitas la experiencia para saber cómo ganarla y creo que nosotros ahora la tenemos. No es sobre jugar mejor, no es de ser mejor sobre el papel, es cuestión de momentos. Es sobre ser muy sólido atrás y ser muy eficiente delante\". Además, ha dejado una anécdota muy particular sobre el Real Madrid y cómo ellos escenifican ese extra necesario para ganar la Champions: \"Recuerdo al Real Madrid, jugaban contra el Liverpool, iban perdiendo 2-0, y vi sus caras... Yo estaba como: 'Estos tíos no están preocupados...'. Les dije a los chicos: 'Chicos, ¿estáis viendo sus caras?...'. Ellos (los jugadores del Real Madrid) decían: 'Superaremos esta situación, no os preocupéis...\" . El del City termina explicando que \"hasta que no lo vives no sabes lo difícil que es\". Balón de Oro Tras sumar otro año muy meritorio con el Manchester City, dominando la Premier League, y sumando los éxitos con la Selección española, France Football tuvo a bien elegir a Rodri como uno de los elegidos para optar al Balón de Oro. Joe Hart le ha preguntado por su posición y los pocos mediocentros defensivos que han ganado este galardón, siendo Matthäus el último en lograrlo en 1990: \"Creo que Matthäus era más ofensivo que defensivo y todos sabemos que los que los fans aman del fútbol son los goles y las asistencias, así que los delanteros tienen más opciones\". Además, Rodri asegura que le \"encantaría que un jugador español ganara el Balón de Oro\", como ya dijo al terminar la Eurocopa. \"Lo hemos merecido durante muchos años porque en el mejor periodo de nuestra historia, teníamos a Cristiano y a Messi, que eran los mejores, y tuvimos muchos grandes jugadores y un gran fútbol\". Rodri se muestra sorprendido de que España sólo cuente con el Balón de Oro de Luis Suárez Miramontes en sus vitrinas, \"creo que España debería tener ese reconocimiento\". La Eurocopa conseguida por España Rodri fue nombrado mejor jugador de la Eurocopa después de que la Selección consiguiera levantar el título en la final de Berlín. \"Representar a tu país es una de las cosas más grandes, así que ganar con tu país es un sueño hecho realidad... sobre todo por los equipos a los que hubo que derrotar\", asegura el mediocentro, que también ha puesto en valor el gran equipo con el que contaba Inglaterra: \"Les decía a mis compañeros que con el equipo que tenían podrían ganar la Euro con tres onces distintos\". El capitán de la Selección relata que sus primeras memorias viendo a 'La Roja' son de 2006 y 2008, con la que él considera como \"la mejor generación de todos los tiempos\". Por eso mismo, \"ser la siguiente generación de estos tipos siempre es complicado\", comenta, confiado de que esta nueva generación quiere seguir ganando y tiene las expectativas muy altas\".",
