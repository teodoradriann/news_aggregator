    "text": "NEW DELHI, Jul 11: In an interconnected world, “no war is distant anymore”, US envoy Eric Garcetti said on Thursday and asserted that one must not just stand for peace, but also take concrete actions to make sure those who don’t play by peaceful rules, their war machines “cannot continue unabated”. “And that is something the US needs to know and that India needs to know together,” the ambassador said during a keynote address at an event here as he also pitched for forging a stronger partnership between New Delhi and Washington envisioning them together as an “unstoppable force for good in the world”. His comments come in the backdrop of multiple ongoing conflicts in the world, including in Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. In his address at a defence news conclave here, he described India-US ties as deep, ancient and increasingly broad, and said “today I think that culminates together as we look at the US-India defence partnership”. The event was held at the Unites Services Institution (USI), Delhi, and attended by many defence experts. “We don’t just see our future in India and India doesn’t just sees its future with the US, but the world can see great things in our relationship. In other words, there are countries on the sidelines hoping this relationship works. Because, if it works, it doesn’t just become a counterbalance, it becomes a place where we are developing our weapons together, integrating our training together,” Garcetti said. In times of emergencies, whether that be a natural disaster or god forbid, a human-caused war, “the US and India will be a powerful ballast against the waves that will sweep over Asia and other parts of the world”, he asserted. “And I think, we all know that we are interconnected in the world, no war is distant anymore. And we must not just stand for peace, we must take concrete actions to make sure those who don’t play by peaceful rules, that their war machines cannot continue unabated. And that is something the US needs to know and that India needs to know together,” the envoy said. “In the past three years, we have witnessed countries which have ignored sovereign borders. I dont’ have to remind how important borders are, it’s a central principle to peace in our world,” he added. The American ambassador to India underlined that he had come to the event not to teach, preach or lecture, but always to listen in and learn and remind of their “commonly shared values”. “That when we stand on those principles and stand together, even in difficult times, we are friends, that we can show that principles are the guiding light of peace in our world. And together the world’s two largest democracies can enhance the security, the stability of our region,” he said. Underlining various areas of commonalty in India-US and its potential, the envoy said, “India sees its future with America, America sees its future with India.” “Any objective observer will see that. We see it in our commerce, we see it in our people and certainly we see it in our security and future,” he added. In his address, he also spoke of the historic state visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US in June 2023. “And a year after the prime minister came for that historic (visit), yes, one of the highlights of post-Independence India’s relations with the US, there has nothing that has died down in enthusiasm, the focus, the relationship of Americans towards India,” the envoy said. Describing the essence of the bilateral ties as “commitment”, he said, “It is a relationship. It is true, it is trusting and it is tried and it is tested.” “Love is the only thing you can give more and receive more of it back. It is not a finite thing, it’s not a win or lose, it is not a zero-sum game. It is important for us as Americans and as Indians, the more we put into this relationship, the more we will get out (of it). The more we insist on kind of cynical calculations in the place of trusted relationships, the less we will get,” the ambassador said. He said the US-India relationship is “wide and it is deeper than it has ever been” but it is “not yet deep enough”. But this senator or this member of the Congress concerned about an NGO, concerned about a religious group, concerned about a human rights issue, concerned about a thing that “sometimes we pretend don’t exist, but we must actually confront and find a good language to talk about”, he said. “If you look at the circles that unite our values, they are not completely concentric, but they mostly overlap, I would say 80-90 per cent,” the envoy said. Garcetti said “our heads and hearts are aligned” but the question is can the two countries “move the feet together” and build that continued deep trust and have the outcomes that meet the security threats of this moment. “Because if we only look inward, neither the US nor India in the Indo-Pacific will keep up with the pace of threats today,” he said, adding, “be they, state actors on your border that we are also concerned about, in this region and other regions”, be that climate change and the associated threats that US sees in this country. “The stakes for our technological innovation together, the stakes for our climate action together, the stakes for our military cooperation have never been higher because pace of change has never been faster,” Garcetti asserted. He described the US-India defence partnership as one which stands “among the most consequential” in the world. (PTI) India sees its future with America, America sees its future with India: US envoy NEW DELHI, Jul 11: In an interconnected world, “no war is distant anymore”, US envoy Eric Garcetti said on Thursday and asserted that one must not just stand for peace, but also take concrete actions to make sure those who don’t play by peaceful rules, their war machines “cannot continue unabated”.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Respiratory Disease Vaccine: A Leading Driver Behind The Rising Incidence Of Tuberculosis Drives Growth In The Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Market Expansion in 2025 07-31-2025 07:04 AM CET | Health & Medicine\nPress release from: The Business Research Company Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market\nUse code ONLINE30 to get 30% off on global market reports and stay ahead of tariff changes, macro trends, and global economic shifts\nWhat Will the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Industry Market Size Be by 2025?\nIn the past few years, the size of the respiratory disease vaccine market has experienced a slight increase. It is projected to rise from $69.99 billion in 2024 to $70.9 billion in 2025, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.3%. Factors such as a growing prevalence of respiratory diseases, heightened public consciousness regarding vaccination, public health campaigns, and a widening demand for efficient and more manageable vaccines have contributed to this growth in the historical phase.\nWhat's the Long-Term Growth Forecast for the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Size Through 2029?\nThe market size of the respiratory disease vaccine is predicted to exhibit a consistent expansion in the upcoming years, reaching a value of $79.16 billion by 2029 with a CAGR of 2.8%. The surge during the forecasted phase can be traced back to factors such as an aging demographic, an increase in healthcare expenditure, investments funnelled into vaccines, and readiness for potential pandemics. The forecasted time frame will also see significant trends like innovative vaccine solutions, cooperative research, progression in vaccine formulation, and authorization of drugs.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/respiratory-disease-vaccine-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Key Growth Drivers Fueling the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Expansion?\nThe escalating cases of tuberculosis are anticipated to fuel the expansion of the market for respiratory disease vaccines. Tuberculosis (TB), a respiratory ailment caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium, primarily targets the lungs and could potentially compromise other systems and organs, resulting in a variety of issues. The surge in tuberculosis cases could accelerate the production and distribution of vaccines for respiratory diseases, in an effort to curb TB proliferation. For instance, statistics from the US-based government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveal that there were 8,331 tuberculosis (TB) cases reported in the United States in 2022, signifying a 5.9% growth in the case tally compared to 2021. The incidence rate escalated to 2.5 cases for every 100,000 individuals, showing a 5.5% upsurge from the year before. Consequently, the mounting cases of tuberculosis will be a driving force for the market for respiratory disease vaccines. The rising prevalence of smoking is predicted to accelerate the expansion of the market for respiratory disease vaccines. Smoking pertains to inhaling and exhaling smoke generated by burning tobacco or tobacco-containing products, which pose a variety of health threats, such as tracheitis, heart diseases, stroke, and cancer. Vaccines for respiratory diseases can offer a certain level of protection against specific infections prevalent among smokers. For instance, information sourced from Statistics Canada, a governmental agency in Canada, indicates that cigarette production rose by 5.8% compared to June 2021. Furthermore, the total quantity of cigarettes sold witnessed a 1.3% rise from May 2022, amounting to 1.4 billion in June 2022. Hence, the escalating prevalence of smoking is fueling the growth of the market for respiratory disease vaccines.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=12924&type=smp\nWhat Are the Key Trends Driving Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Growth?\nLeading corporations active in the respiratory disease vaccine market are focusing on developing cutting-edge products to boost their effectiveness and deliver superior solutions for the prevention and treatment of respiratory disease infections.

    "text": "Andhra Pradesh High Court Directs Police To Return Passport Of TDP Member, Says Fundamental Right To Hold Passport Cannot Be Curtailed Fareedunnisa Huma 29 Dec 2023 6:47 AM GMT The Andhra Pradesh High Court has directed the Superintendent of Police and the Inspector of Police to return the passport of Telugu Desaam Party member Yesasvi Boddulluri, holding that procedure as mandated under Sections 91 and 102 of C.r.P.C was not followed. Justice B.S Bhanumathi has passed the order in a plea filed by Yesasvi Boddulluri against the Police Officials of CB-CID who seized the passport of the petitioner on 23-12-2023 and refused to return it despite repeated persuasions. It said: “As can be understood from the submissions on both sides, the seizure of the passport is not authorized nor was the procedure contemplated under Sections 91 and 102 of Cr.P.C. followed. Therefore, the continuation of holding the passport with respondents No. 3 and 4 is not legally sustainable.” It was noted that the petitioner is an NRI and was arrested at the Airport upon his arrival in Hyderabad this month. Further, the petitioner submitted that he had applied for visa stamping and had been issued the date of 26-12-23 and that if the date was missed by the petitioner, he would have to wait 3 months for the next slot. The Bench held that the petitioner cannot be deprived of his fundamental right to hold a passport without following due procedure established by law. “The fact that the petitioner has applied for renewal of the visa stamping and a date being allotted today is not in dispute. Therefore, the passport is very much required to the petitioner and without following due procedure of law, his fundamental right to hold his passport cannot be curtailed,” it said. The case of the prosecution was that the petitioner was a repeat offender and was in the habit of creating mischief on social media platforms by defaming the government. It was argued that in 2022, two F.I.Rs were registered against him under sections 153A and 505(3) and 120(b) of IPC along with 66-C of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and notices were issued under 41-A of CrPc, but the petitioner distastefully, on the very next day held press conferences and repeated the same statements for which he was charged. The prosecution contended that some conditions may be imposed while allowing relief to the petitioner. The senior counsel arguing on behalf of the petitioner on the other hand contended that all cases booked against the petitioner were frivolous and criticizing the government would not invoke punishment under the above-mentioned sections. Adding to that, it was contended that the procedure laid down under section 91 and section 102 of the CrPC was not followed by the investigating authority. Section 91 states that a police officer is required to issue an order or summon the document that is sought to be seized and section 102 stipulates that the seizure of any document needs to be communicated to a Magistrate. The Senior Counsel also vehemently opposed the prayer sought by the prosecution for imposition of conditions stating that if the petitioner violates the notice, the investigating authority has remedy under appropriate provisions of law. The bench conceding to the arguments of the senior counsel, held: “If at all, there is any violation of notices issued to the petitioner, the remedy is open to the respondents under appropriate provisions of law. As such, for the time being, no need for imposing any condition against the petitioner while allowing this petition and directing to release the passport of the petitioner under due acknowledgment.” The authorities were thus directed to return the passport of the petitioner on the same day.
