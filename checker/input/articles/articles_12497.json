    "title": "Updated ALLELE Data Confirm Clinical Benefit of Tabelecleucel in EBV+ Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease",
    "text": "Your AI-Trained Oncology Knowledge Connection!\nNews\nArticle\nTabelecleucel generated high response rates and favorable OS in patients with EBV-positive PTLD who had progressed on prior standard-of-care approaches.\nTabelecleucel (Ebvallo) monotherapy had a favorable risk-benefit profile in patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) who were refractory to or had relapsed following treatment with rituximab (Rituxan) with or without chemotherapy after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT), according to updated data from a larger cohort of the phase 3 ALLELE trial (NCT03394365).1\nFindings presented at the showed that the overall response rate (ORR) with tabelecleucel among all patients (n = 75) was 50.7% (95% CI, 38.9%-62.4%), comprising a complete response (CR) rate of 28.0% and a partial response rate (PR) rate of 22.7%. For patients who had undergone HCT (n = 26), the ORR was 50.0%, including a CR rate of 30.8% and PR rate of 19.2%. These respective rates for patients who had undergone solid organ transplant (n = 49) were 51.0%, 24.5%, and 26.5%.\nThe estimated median duration of response (DOR) for all responders (n = 38) was 23.0 months (95% CI, 12.1-not evaluable [NE]). For responders who had undergone HCT (n = 13) and solid organ transplant (n = 25), the respective DORs were 19.0 months (95% CI, 1.5-NE) and NE (95% CI, 6.8-NE). In the overall patient population, the median time to response (TTR) was 1.1 months (95% CI, 0.6-9.0), and the median time to best response was 1.6 months (95% CI, 0.6-9.0). In the HCT and solid organ transplant groups, the median TTRs were 1.0 month (95% CI, 0.6-9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI, 0.7-4.7), respectively. The respective times to best response in these groups were 1.0 month (95% CI, 0.6-9.0) and 2.1 months (95% CI, 0.7-7.3).\nThe 12-month OS rate among all patients was 55.7%. Notably, the 12-month OS rate was superior in responders vs nonresponders, at 78.7% vs 28.2%, respectively. The median OS in the overall patient population, responders, and nonresponders was 18.4 months (95% CI, 5.7-NE), NE (95% CI, 18.6 months-NE), and 3.7 months (95% CI, 1.8-11.0), respectively. The 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate among responders was 71.9%, and the median PFS was 23.9 months.\n“Tabelecleucel represents a transformative treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory EBV-positive PTLD,” presenting author Sridhar Chaganti, MD, PhD, MRCP, FRCPath, of the Centre for Clinical Haematology at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, and coauthors wrote in a presentation of the data. “[This agent] had a promising ORR and OS in this difficult-to-treat patient population.”\nALLELE was a global, multicenter, open-label study evaluating tabelecleucel—an allogeneic, non-genetically modified, EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy designed to target and eliminate cells infected with EBV in an HLA-restricted manner. The study enrolled patients with biopsy-proven EBV-positive PTLD who were relapsed/refractory to rituximab after prior allogeneic HCT or rituximab with or without chemotherapy following solid organ transplant who had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 3 or lower.\nIntravenous tabelecleucel was administered at a dose of 2.0 x 106 cells/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of each approximately 5-week treatment cycle. Patients underwent clinical and radiographic assessment on approximately day 28. Notably, patients received additional cycles of tabelecleucel until they achieved best response. Those who did not respond to the agent were permitted to switch to tabelecleucel using a T-cell line with different HLA restrictions. After the end of treatment, patients underwent disease assessment every 3 months for no more than 24 months, and survival status was evaluated every 6 months for no more than 5 years.\nThe study’s primary end point was ORR; key secondary end points included TTR, time to best response, OS in responders vs nonresponders, PFS in responders, and the rates of allograft loss/rejection episodes in the solid organ transplant subgroup.\nPreviously reported data from ALLELE showed that at a median follow-up of 14.1 months (IQR, 5.7-23.9), the ORR with tabelecleucel among patients who had received HCT (n = 14) was 50% (95% CI, 23%-77%). At a median follow-up of 6.0 months (IQR, 1.8-18.4), the ORR for patients who had received solid organ transplant (n = 29) was 52% (95% CI, 33%-71%).2\nThese data supported the FDA’s July 2024 decision to grant priority review to the biologics license application (BLA) seeking the approval of tabelecleucel monotherapy for this patient population.3 A complete response letter was subsequently issued for this application in January 2025.4\nThe median age of all patients was 44.4 years (range, 2.7-81.5), and the median ECOG performance status was 1 (range, 0-3); 26.5% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 2 or higher.1 Most patients were male (58.7%) and had extranodal disease at the time of screening (74.7%). Of the 68 PLTD-adapted prognostic index–evaluable patients, most had intermediate-risk PLTD (50.0%), followed by high-risk (42.6%) and low-risk (5.9%) disease. PLTD-adapted prognostic index information was unknown for 1 patient. Regarding PTLD morphology in the overall patient population, patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (69.3%), plasmablastic lymphoma (4.0%), and other morphology (25.3%). The median times from transplant to EBV-positive PTLD diagnosis were 3.9 months (range, 0.6-66.0) and 10.8 months (range, 2.4-314.4) for patients who underwent HCT and solid organ transplant, respectively. The overall time from PTLD diagnosis to tabelecleucel treatment administration was 4.6 months (range, 0.6-190.5).\nPatients had received a median of 1 (range, 1-5) prior line of systemic therapy, including rituximab monotherapy (86.7%), chemotherapy (46.7%), rituximab plus chemotherapy (37.3%), and immunotherapy (4.0%). For those who underwent standard organ transplant, transplant types included kidney (28.6%), heart (24.5%), lung (18.4%), liver (8.2%), and multivisceral (20.4%).\nAmong all patients, the median number of tabelecleucel cycles was 2 (range, 1-6), and the median number of infusions was 6 (range, 1-18). The median duration of treatment was 1.9 months (range, 0.03-6.5). The number of inpatient infusions was 175, and 353 infusions were administered in the outpatient setting. Most patients (65.3%) received 1 line of tabelecleucel, followed by 2 lines (30.7%) and 3 lines (4.0%).\nRegarding safety, treatment-emergent serious adverse effects (AEs) were experienced by 62.7% of patients, 8.0% of which were treatment related. Most treatment-emergent serious AEs and all fatal treatment-emergent serious AEs were not deemed treatment related.\nNo patients reported experiencing tumor flare reactions, infusion-related reactions, cytokine release syndrome, bone marrow rejection, immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome, immunogenicity, or transmission of infectious diseases, including cytomegalovirus.\nGraft-vs-host disease occurred in 11.5% of patients in the HCT arm, and bone marrow/organ rejection was reported by 6.1% of patients in the solid organ transplant arm; none of these cases were tabelecleucel related.\nDisclosures: Chiganti reported receiving honoraria for service on advisory boards/consultancy for AbbVie, Kite/Gilead, Roche, Pierre Fabre, BMS-Celgene, Amgen, Sobi, and Autolus; receiving speaker fees from Takeda, Kite/Gilead, Incyte, AbbVie, Pierre Fabre, and Roche; and providing meeting attendance support for Takeda, Kite/Gilead, and Pierre Fabre.",

    "text": "[Cincinnati](/cincinnati-oh)\nHomeless shelters brace for impact of inclement cold weather\nBy Connor Steffen,\n1 hours agoInside Hope House Mission's men's shelter, a pristine chapel is in the process of being converted into what looks like a makeshift hostel.\nFour mattresses touch all four corners of the airy room. The shelter's executive director, Dr. Mitchell Foster, said they have around 20 more they anticipate to use soon.\n“The police are already starting to literally bring the men in from off the streets (because of) the frigid temperatures that are coming in,” Foster said. “We're seeing it now, and it's not even cold. It's not even at that temperature.”\nFoster said the shelter, which is already at its capacity of 50 men, welcomed in six more men this week due to the inclement weather.\nWhen asked, given the [ forecast ](https://www.wcpo.com/weather/snow-tonight-and-more-coming-this-weekend#google_vignette) , whether he expects that trend to continue next week, he said he would look at the number “doubling, maybe tripling.”\n“It's great for the shelter, because that is what we do, and we're here to help,” Foster said. “We're here to be that light, that hope for the community.”\nThe Tri-State can expect a potent weather system traveling from the southwest to bring periods of winter weather Sunday afternoon, resulting in accumulating snow. Models show it will be followed by periods of a wintry mix Sunday night into Monday morning before more snow falls Monday during the day.\n“There's definitely a cold snap coming, so I think you'll see an influx of guys here,” said Joseph Ross, a shelter resident who’s experienced homelessness in cold temperatures before. “I think it'll keep climbing — the numbers here in the next month, probably.”\nHaving shared that experience, Ross said he worries for those who will be without a roof over their heads next week.\n“I think sometimes it kind of happens quick, and all of a sudden, you're living in those elements,” Ross said. “You don't ever want to feel that way again. I just try to make sure I don't do the things that got me to that point. And again, some of us were stubborn.”\nHope House Mission has three facilities: a men’s shelter, a women’s shelter and a warming center. Foster said the men’s and women’s shelters are at capacity while the warming center, meant to serve people queued up to get into shelters, is five people away from being at capacity.\nMore local news:[New law could change the number of villages in Ohio](https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/new-law-could-change-the-number-of-villages-in-ohio)\n['Blood was in the streets' | Travelers return home from New Orleans](https://www.wcpo.com/news/national-news/blood-was-in-the-streets-tri-state-travelers-recount-scene-after-returning-from-trip-to-new-orleans)\n['A lifeline for many' | In Avondale, the library is about more than books](https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/finding-solutions/public-libraries-are-a-lifeline-for-many-for-avondale-the-library-is-about-much-more-than-books)",
