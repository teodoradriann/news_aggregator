    "text": "Na vanguardista Estocolmo, capital da Suécia, fazer compras pode ser uma experiência totalmente autônoma. A cidade abriga supermercados que funcionam sem nenhum funcionário presencial, operando 24 horas por dia com base em tecnologia de autoatendimento, aplicativos e inteligência artificial.\nEssa inovação faz parte do modelo escandinavo de confiança social e eficiência urbana — e está mudando a forma como os moradores interagem com o comércio do dia a dia.\nComo funcionam os supermercados sem funcionários?\nEm redes como a Lifvs e outras lojas autônomas espalhadas por Estocolmo, o processo é simples:\n- O cliente acessa a loja usando um aplicativo no celular (com autenticação por QR Code)\n- Dentro da loja, os produtos são escaneados pelo próprio usuário\n- O pagamento é feito via app, por cartão de crédito ou carteiras digitais\n- Câmeras e sensores monitoram os produtos e garantem a segurança\n- O reabastecimento é feito por equipes logísticas que visitam periodicamente as lojas\nTudo é baseado na confiança, no bom comportamento da comunidade e na tecnologia de rastreamento.\nPor que Estocolmo apostou em supermercados autônomos?\nA proposta atende a diversos objetivos da cidade:\n- Ampliar o acesso a alimentos em bairros com menos comércio\n- Reduzir custos operacionais e aumentar a eficiência\n- Oferecer conveniência com funcionamento 24/7\n- Incentivar soluções de consumo inteligentes e sustentáveis\nAlém disso, a cultura sueca de respeito às regras e alta digitalização torna o modelo viável e eficaz.\nCuriosidades sobre os mercados autônomos em Estocolmo\n- Alguns funcionam em vilarejos remotos, onde seria inviável manter lojas tradicionais\n- O app do mercado também mostra receitas e promoções personalizadas\n- Há versões móveis desses mercados, instalados em contêineres que se movem de bairro em bairro\n- Estocolmo tem um dos índices mais baixos de furtos em lojas da Europa\n- O modelo já inspirou iniciativas em países como Alemanha, Japão e Estados Unidos\nEstocolmo mostra que confiança, tecnologia e praticidade podem andar juntas, criando um novo jeito de consumir — mais rápido, eficiente e adaptado ao ritmo da vida urbana moderna.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted gifts worth millions of dollars over 20 years, analysis finds",
    "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted millions of dollars’ worth of gifts over two decades on the bench, according to a new data analysis. The figure sets Thomas far apart from his current colleagues, according to the nonprofit Fix the Court. The analysis provides fodder for Supreme Court critics who have called for reforms in the wake of a series of politically incendiary rulings and ongoing ethics scandals. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted millions of dollars’ worth of gifts over the past two decades on the bench, a total nearly 10 times the value of all gifts received by his fellow justices during the same time, according to a new analysis.\nThomas received 103 gifts with a total value of more than $2.4 million between 2004 and 2023, the judicial reform group Fix the Court said in a report Thursday.\nIn contrast, Thomas’ fellow justices over the same period accepted a total of just 93 gifts worth a combined value of only about $248,000, according to the nonprofit group.\nThomas’ fellow conservative justice Samuel Alito accounted for the lion’s share of that value. Fix the Court’s analysis found that Alito accepted 16 gifts worth a combined $170,095.\nFix the Court identified another 101 “likely gifts” — with a total estimated value of almost $1.8 million —that Thomas received in the form of free trips and lodging from billionaire businessman Harlan Crow, and at the exclusive Bohemian Grove club.\nCounting those gifts, Thomas’ total two-decade haul is valued at nearly $4.2 million.\nFix the Court’s analysis is largely based on investigative reporting by the media outlet ProPublica over the past year, which has been focused on Thomas and Alito and which has sparked calls for ethics reform at the Supreme Court.\nThe group also factored in data from the Congressional Record, the justices’ annual financial disclosures, other news sources, and its own law clerk-led research.\nThe value and number of gifts Thomas received also eclipsed those accepted by eight retired or dead Supreme Court justices whose tenures overlapped his service on the court, which began in 1991.\nThe late Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who served more than 34 years on the court, received 73 gifts until she retired in early 2006, putting her in second place behind Thomas in total number of gifts.\nBut the combined value of O’Connor’s gifts was less than $36,000.\nAntonin Scalia, a conservative justice who died in 2016 while on the court, accepted 67 gifts worth about $210,000 during his tenure, which began in 1986.\nThe late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, whose career on the court spanned 33 years until 2005, accepted just six gifts, with a total value of less than $13,000.\n“Supreme Court justices should not be accepting gifts, let alone the hundreds of freebies worth millions of dollars they’ve received over the years,” Fix the Court’s executive director, Gabe Roth, said in a statement.\n“The ethics crisis at the Court won’t begin to abate until justices adopt stricter gift acceptance rules,” Roth said.\nFix the Court noted that the total figures it calculated for gift values are likely lower than the actual values because the analysis erred on the low end of the cost of some gifts, such as free travel or tickets to sports events.\nIts tally also makes some assumptions. The group assumed the cost per hour of a flight on a private plane is $10,000, for instance, and it counted each leg of a roundtrip flight as a separate gift.\nThe Supreme Court did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on Fix the Court’s findings.\nProPublica first revealed that Thomas had accepted years of luxury trips from Republican megadonor Crow without reporting them on his financial disclosures, which ethics experts said he was required to do.\nThomas said his judicial colleagues had told him that he did not have to disclose those travel expenses.\nThe analysis nevertheless provides fodder for the Supreme Court’s increasingly vocal critics who have called for reforms in the wake of a series of politically incendiary rulings and ongoing ethics scandals .\nThe court under Chief Justice John Roberts has made some concessions, including adopting a formal — though unenforceable — code of ethics in November.\nThe court in that document aimed to “dispel” the “misunderstanding” that the court’s nine justices “regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.”\nThe federal judiciary, meanwhile, implemented new rules this year requiring Supreme Court justices to disclose the value of travel-related gifts on their financial disclosure forms.",
