    "text": "MAGA influencers call for boycott of Dunkin' Donuts Published in [Political News](/politics/politicalnews/) Dunkin’ Donuts is facing a boycott from prominent MAGA figures after Rumble’s CEO claimed the chain won’t advertise on his video sharing platform due to divisive right-wing content. The grumbling began Wednesday when Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski posted what appeared to be a snippet of an email from Dunkin’s parent company, Inspire Brands. “I would be opposed to showing up on the current version of the platform,” the email read. “The right wing culture of the site is too polarizing from a brand sustainability standpoint today.” The sender added that Inspire Brands would be open to revisiting the matter as “the site evolves.” Rumble hosts programming from controversial right-wing fabulists including Alex Jones, Nick Fuentes and Tucker Carlson. Social media MAGA influencer Catturd expressed outrage over Dunkin’s choice on X — another online platform struggling to attract advertisers because of its far right-wing content. “So, companies like POS @dunkindonuts are boycotting Rumble, and X, unless they drop all the truth tellers,” the online personality wrote Wednesday night to his 2.7 million followers. “I’m calling on everyone to BudLight @dunkindonuts.” Bud Light took a financial blow in 2023 after it launched a promotion featuring transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The campaign offended MAGA loyalists including musician Kid Rock, who filmed himself shooting at several cases of beer. Right-wing pundit Steven Crowder, who has 2.2 million followers on X, praised Pavlovski’s decision to target potential advertisers that choose to avoid content they find objectionable. He also encouraged his supporters to exercise their freedom to boycott such companies. “This is the power that YOU have,” he wrote on the platform Thursday. “When you don’t Kowtow to the woke mob, you win.” Crowder was one of several activists who celebrated Wednesday’s New York Times report that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media — an organization being sued by Rumble and X — was suspending operations amid antitrust allegations. The nonprofit group said it can’t afford to fight back. Inspire Brands, which also operates Arby’s, Baskin Robbins and Buffalo Wild Wings, hasn’t responded to a request for comment. ©2024 New York Daily News. Visit nydailynews.com.

    "text": "New Delhi [India], February 19 (ANI): All India Imam Association Chairman Sajid Rashidi has urged parties to not politicise the Telangana government's decision to allow Muslim employees to leave at 4 PM during Ramzan .\nSpeaking to ANI, Rashidi stated that if the government is giving one-hour relief to Muslims during Ramzan , then there shouldn't be any politics on it. He stated that it is the duty of every Indian to respect religious ideas of every religion.\nSajid Rashidi said, \"There is no doubt that Ramadan is a holy festival, and it is the duty of every Indian to respect the faith of another religion. If the government is giving one hour on such occasions, then there should be no politics on this. Any community should get this exemption on any festival, whether it is the Hindu community, the Sikh community, or the Christian community.\"\nRashidi stated that the misfortune of the nation is the politics that is being done on the name of religion. He added that none of the political parties are focusing on unemployment and inflation and are busy in doing appeasement politics.\n\"The misfortune of our country is that whatever politics we do, we do it in the name of religion, whether it is Ram Mandir, Triple Talaq, 370 or Uniform Civil Code, all this politics is being done in the name of religion. No one is paying attention to how much inflation is there, how much unemployment there is. All this is appeasement politics\", he added.\nOn Tuesday, the Telangana government allowed the government Muslim employees to leave at 4 PM during Ramzan . These included teachers, contract, out-sourcing, boards, corporations and Public Sector employees working in the State to leave their Offices/Schools at 4.00 p.m. during the Holy Month of Ramzan that is from March 2 to March 31.

    "text": "Friday, December 13: December’s characteristic chill has finally set in over the eastern expanses of the country, with many states in for a further dip in temperatures over the next few days.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a well-marked low-pressure area has formed near the Gulf of Mannar, which will move westwards towards Lakshadweep over the course of the day. While it is unlikely to cause any rain over East India, it could result in cool and foggy days over many parts.\nAs a result, the IMD forecasts a cold wave over a few sections of Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand till tomorrow (December 13-14). Dense fog is also likely to impact isolated areas of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar in the early morning or late night hours of Friday.\nAs for other major cities in the region, most parts of Kolkata will likely see daytime temperatures climb to a maximum of 23-25°C, with nighttime lows falling to a shivering 11-12°C over the next 3-4 days. Some areas could experience fog or mist in the morning on Sunday (December 15).\nSimilar conditions are in store for Odisha’s Bhubaneshwar, with maximums of 25-26°C on the cards till Monday (December 13-16). Nighttime temperatures are likely to drop a couple of degrees to 12°C by next week, the IMD predictions show.\nMeanwhile, foggy days will engulf both Patna in Bihar and Jharkhand’s Ranchi districts over the next five days. Maximum temperatures in these areas are likely to hang around 23-24°C maximums, with minimums falling to a chilly 13-14°C in Patna and an even more freezing 8-9°C in Ranchi.\nAs a result of these conditions, the IMD has placed a yellow watch over Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal on Friday and Saturday, urging residents to “be updated” on the weather.\n**\nFor weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).
