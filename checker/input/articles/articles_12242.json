    "title": "Sangiuliano cita Benedetto Croce: \"Siamo tornati all'aria aperta, ovvero a ragionare\"",
    "text": "(Agenzia Vista) Napoli, 29 dicembre 2023 \"Oggi siamo tornati alla libertà, ovvero a ragionare con il nostro cervello, mentre prima avevamo un metodo per cui qualcuno voleva imporre in maniera saccente, pedagogica e didattica la sua visione, dicendo che quella era la visione assoluta, mentre tutto deve essere sottoposto al vaglio dei cittadini\". A margine del sopralluogo alla Villa Floridiana di Napoli, il ministro della Cultura, Gennaro Sangiuliano, cita il 'Profilo ideologico del Novecento italianò di Norberto Bobbio. \"Bobbio - spiega Sangiuliano - riprendendo un'affermazione di Benedetto Croce, in chiave antipositivista, per riaffermare il valore dell'idealismo e dello storicismo, dice 'siamo tornati all'aria apertà, cioè siamo tornati a ragionare con il nostro cervello\". Per esprimere meglio il concetto, il ministro cita anche la triade hegeliana. \"Io pongo una tesi - argomenta - lei può porre legittimamente un'antitesi alla mia nozione e poi i cittadini trattano la loro sintesi. Questo significa libertà, mentre prima avevamo un metodo in cui uno arrivava in maniera saccente, pedagogica e didattica e voleva imporre la sua visione, dicendo era la visione assoluta. No, tutto deve essere sottoposto al vaglio critico dei cittadini\".

    "title": "Boos ring out at Emirates after Arsenal handed a lesson by West Ham",
    "text": "The Telegraph Boos ring out at Emirates after Arsenal get taught a lesson by West Ham Read full article Sam Wallace 1 January 2024 at 2:18 pm · 29-min read Konstantinos Mavropanos , the former Arsenal defender, made a muted= goal celebration - Peter Cziborra/Action Images\nThese have been days when Mikel Arteta’s team look like the greatest threat to this era of Manchester City ’s Premier League dominance and then there are nights such as these when the old anxieties accumulated over two Arsenal decades feel just as potent as ever.\nThis was the kind of game which felt hard for Arsenal to lose by one goal, let alone two, against a David Moyes team that can be brittle or stubborn in equal measure. If this is to be the transformative title-winning season for Arsenal, 20 years after the last, then it will be with some bewilderment that they look back on a campaign that saw them lose twice to West Ham before the New Year.\nWith 77 touches in the West Ham penalty area – a Premier League record for an attacking side going back to 2009 – the inevitable question is what this Arsenal team might be with a goalscorer, or at least a more prolific goalscorer than they have currently. It is a question that keeps rebounding on Arteta and he pushed it away again here. His team had 30 attempts on the West Ham goal; “perhaps we need 50, 60,” he shrugged. His point was that this was simply a question of fine margins that did not require fixes that cost tens of millions of pounds.\nThere are those kinds of debates about the final missing player, and then there is a broader question about the anguish that sweeps over Arsenal in moments such as these. From leaders at the start of the month they might be fourth by the time they play against Fulham on New Year’s Eve. There is a collective pain in the stadium when this elegant young side put together by Arteta start to falter – a buried memory of all the other traumas of the late Arsene Wenger-era decline.\nBy the end, when Declan Rice slipped as he went in on Emerson and conceded a penalty that would be saved, it was all there. A great sigh from the home crowd at a familiar sense of disappointment. West Ham had 26 per cent of the possession overall and 100 per cent of the benefit of the doubt for the first goal which was marginal to say the least.\nStory continues The injury-time penalty conceded by Declan Rice took the shine off his evening - Getty Images/Peter Cziborra When the substitute Said Benrahma had his penalty saved by David Raya in the sixth minute of time added-on at the end of the game it was just West Ham’s third attempt on target all evening. The two others had resulted in goals.\nMoyes’ team can pull off this kind of heist. Thrashed at Craven Cottage and Anfield, winners away at Tottenham and then at home against Manchester United – this was another milestone in the tumultuous West Ham season of 2023-24. Moyes is having some kind of say in the title-race, and his side are lurking on the margins of it. Remarkably this win propelled West Ham up to sixth place.\nThis one was spicy: that highly debatable first West Ham goal , another for the former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos and a 95th minute penalty conceded by Rice, the £100million man who left West Ham last summer.\nWell, well, well!\nThe Emirates is stunned as West Ham break the deadlock thanks to Tomas Soucek! #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/R2T3jkcB1j\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023\nThe problem with that first West Ham goal was obvious. The referee Michael Oliver gave it in the moment. He did so on the basis that had the ball gone out of play when Jarrod Bowen turned it back for Tomas Soucek, then the Var, Craig Pawson, would spot it. But Var had no chance with Bowen’s position obscuring the best view of the moment. In short, Pawson was left with non-conclusive evidence and had to go with the on-field decision. Which itself was surely made with the Var safety net in mind.\nNo-one really knew. That was abundantly clear through five minutes of Var having replayed it, zoomed in, changed the frame in which the contact took place. They may as well have asked the crowd if anyone had caught it on their phone.\nJarrod Bowen played the pass to Tomas Soucek that led to the goal It had been an inauspicious bit of defending from Gabriel Magalhaes and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Emerson’s cross. On balance it had probably deflected off the latter and gone into touch. Nevertheless, Bowen launched himself at it, guided the ball back for Soucek to score and so the game turned on that moment.\nArsenal still had plenty of time to put it right and yet for all the touches in the West Ham box and the overwhelming possession count, it never came. “A brilliant defensive job – terrific structure, organisation, discipline by the players,” Moyes said later. It was not, he said, a quality so often commented upon. “But Arsenal,” he said, “used to make a living out of that many years ago.”\nHe even said that he agreed with Diego Simeone’s recent remarks that the Premier League sometimes did not cherish defending as much as it should.\nHe lost Lucas Paqueta to an injury in the first half. The Brazilian was struggling in the warm-up with a problem in the back of his right knee and Moyes said that the player was never up to speed all night. With him going off so departed West Ham’s most creative presence and best hope of getting up the pitch.\nBukayo Saka hit a post before the break and like his team-mates he too seemed to struggle to see a way past the excellent goalkeeper Alphonse Areola .\nThe Emirates is alive now!\nBukayo Saka hits the post for Arsenal! 😵\nWatch #ARSWHU LIVE: https://t.co/XBvNsM6diG pic.twitter.com/TRpN9PaamA\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023\nHard to recall many other times before the break when West Ham ventured out of their own half. That was until Mavropanos scored the second with a towering header on 56 minutes, well above Gabriel Magalhaes. The penalty conceded by Rice was a dismal end to it all, although by then the Emirates was already resigned to defeat.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos silences the Emirates!\nThe former Arsenal man heads home brilliantly for West Ham's second 👏 #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/KNXA11gGOV\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023\nWest Ham stun Arsenal – as it happened 10:49 PM GMT The goal that won it Konstantinos Mavropanos silences the Emirates!\nThe former Arsenal man heads home brilliantly for West Ham's second 👏 #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/KNXA11gGOV\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023\n10:45 PM GMT Mikel Arteta speaks to Amazon Prime Sport On the defeat...\n“They won the game..we deserved more than what we got. The players tried and tried. They had two shots and got two goals...I have [no criticism] for the players, I have to praise them they went for it and didn’t get what we deserved...They tried hard, they did their best, and attitude was very good.”\nOn West Ham’s controversial opener...\n“I don’t know haven’t seen it. Is the technology good enough? That’s the question, but I haven’t seen [the goal]?”\nOn the rest of the season for Arsenal...\n“I want to be at the top, the way [the players] tried..it happens. Another day we have three points for sure...We are in good position, today was disappointing but have to pick ourselves up for next match.”\n10:37 PM GMT James Ward-Prowse speaks to Amazon Prime Sport On playing for West Ham and the win...\n“It’s fantastic...great to be part of a historic win for us. It’s fantastic. It’s hard working club, full of people who love the club. Great to be part of a group willing to work hard, if you do that then hopefully [wins come your way].”\nOn his deadly set pieces deliveries...\n“We work on it a lot, it’s tedious at times but worth it.”\nOn playing under David Moyes...\n“I’ve worked under a lot of managers...I am learning new things every day under [Moyes].”\nOn the aims for the rest of the season for West Ham...\n“You never know what can happen, but it’s the old cliche you can never get too carried away.”\n10:31 PM GMT Sam Dean on the Blue Wall Did I say West Ham were brilliant defensively tonight?!\nBetween them, Emerson Palmieri, Mavropanos, Angelo Obgonna, Vladimir Coufal, Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse made 31 clearances tonight. Blue wall.\n— Sam Dean (@SamJDean) December 28, 2023\n10:28 PM GMT Jarrod Bowen and Konstantinos Mavropanos speak to Amazon Prime Sport Bowen on the victory...\n“Massive win, knew would be difficult but had to build on our Man Utd win. We haven’t been consistent enough, to be in the top six you need to be consistent.”\nOn the controversial opener...\n“When it happens in a split second, I tried to keep it in play. I haven’t seen it. It’s in the air so it’s hard to tell, if it is on the floor it’s easier. I just tried to get the ball across and the goal stood.”\nBowen on what next for West Ham...\n“We have to go to Brighton next up and win there. We take it a game at a time, know it’s boring but we just have to look after ourselves.”\nMavropanos on the brilliant defensive work...\n“The work from everyone was amazing. Worked defensively well and [took our chances].”\nOn his goal...\n“We work a lot on set pieces and today was the day.”\n10:19 PM GMT This pic sums up Arsenal's night Martin Odegaard looks to the sky for inspiration that wasn't forthcoming - Action Images via Reuters /Peter Cziborra 10:16 PM GMT Weird to think that some West Ham fans Aren’t convinced by David Moyes...\nThe Scot had not won any of the previous 72 Premier League away matches he has managed against Arsenal, Chelsea , Liverpool and Manchester United. He’s broken his duck in classic Moyes style.\nTake a bow David Moyes - Getty Images/Catherine Ivill 10:16 PM GMT Arsenal were off the pace from the start They lacked urgency and they didn’t look at the races. But West Ham have been great tonight. If you love your defending then watch a re-run of this match. They defended in numbers and kept their shape well. Arsenal passed well but everything was in front of the visitors and they deserved the three points.\n10:14 PM GMT FULL-TIME: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham That was indeed the last action of the match and Arsenal miss that chance to go top of the table.\n10:13 PM GMT MISSED PENALTY! Benrahma takes the spot kick and Reya goes the right way and saves. It won’t matter...\n10:12 PM GMT PENALTY FOR WEST HAM! West Ham break, the ball falls to Rice, of all players, he slips, loses the ball then sticks out his leg and brings down Emerson. As clearcut a penalty as you are likely to see...\n10:11 PM GMT 93 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham The home fans are leaving, they have given up the ghost. West Ham are defending so well, in numbers and keeping their shape, I can only see a breakaway goal here, Arsenal could play for another hour and not score at this rate...\n10:09 PM GMT 91 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Another corner for Arsenal. Odegaard delivers and it’s headed over for another corner. This time Ward-Prowse clears at the near post...\n10:08 PM GMT 89 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Another Odegaard attempt from distance, this one is good, though, and force Areola into a great save round the corner. From the resulting corner the ball ultimately falls at the feet of Nelson who takes a touch before a left-footed shot goes just wide.\nTime very much running out for the hosts, there will be five minutes added time.\n10:06 PM GMT 88 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Another half-chance for Arsenal, this one sees Nketiah with a hopeful overhead kick. Again the attempt is into the arms of Areola.\n10:04 PM GMT 87 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham This time it’s Odegaard to have a half-chance (No.845734956732495 of the night). His shot is well blocked by the ever resolute West Ham defence who have been brilliant this evening.\n10:02 PM GMT 85 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham More decent passing from the hosts but West Ham keep their shape and the gilt-edge chance doesn’t materialise. That’s been the story of the night and this time Smith-Rowe is forced to shoot from the edge of the box straight into the arms of a grateful Areola.\n10:00 PM GMT 84 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham It’s very quiet at the Emirates at the moment. The crowd sensing that it’s nt going to happen tonight for their team?\n09:59 PM GMT 81 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Saka and Jesus combine on the edge of area before the former falls under a ‘challenge’ of Ogbonna . A replay suggests its a bit theatrical from Saka and Var agrees after the video boffins take a look at the incident.\n09:57 PM GMT 80 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Smith-Rowe makes a great run from inside his own half, is seen by Odegaard who pings an exocet of a cross for the sub who just fails to make contact at the back post. More like it from the hosts, but is it a case of too little, too late?\n09:55 PM GMT 78 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Another change for the hosts: Trossard , who hasn’t been able to get into this contest, makes way for Emile Smith-Rowe .\n09:55 PM GMT 77 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Saka tries his luck from just outside the area and Areola saves well low down. Twelve minutes to go.\n09:54 PM GMT 75 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham There’s now, understandably, a bit of urgency about Arsenal but you feel they need to score in the next few minutes if they are to put the frighteners under West Ham. The visitors have defended well throughout and kept their shape.\n09:52 PM GMT 73 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Corner for Arsenal and some last-ditch defending at the back post from Coufal with Jesus lurking saves West Ham’s bacon. The ball ultimately comes to Odegaard whose shot from distance is well wide.\n09:50 PM GMT 72 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham As Arsenal go in search of a goal there is more space for West Ham to play with and Kudus has a shot well blocked in the Arsenal area.\n09:47 PM GMT 68 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Since the substitutions Arsenal have been a bit more direct, they’ve had two good chances (both Jesus headers) but time is running out.\n09:43 PM GMT 65 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Another great chance for Arsenal and Jesus. Magic feet from Odegaard, allows White to get to the byline and stand the ball up at the back post. There it finds Jesus who at the very least has to hit the target, but only succeeds in heading well over when unchallenged.\nArteta looks pained and it’s not hard to see why...\n09:42 PM GMT 63 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Finally a decent ball from a wide area for the hosts, it finds the head of Jesus whose attempt is saved low by Areola. The West Ham keeper did well to hold onto that as Nelson was lurking with intent.\n09:41 PM GMT 63 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Changes for Arsenal: Martinelli and Zinchenko make way for Nketiah and Nelson.\n09:39 PM GMT History in the making? David Moyes has not won any of the previous 72 Premier League away matches he has managed against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. If this is finally it (and it’s looking pretty good for him at the moment) then it’s being done in classic Moyes style. Defending deep in numbers, then counter-attacking with speed and decisiveness. A brilliant performance by his players so far.\n09:38 PM GMT 59 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham Arsenal have had 44 touches in the West Ham box but have nothing to show for it. Sort of underlines the point about them not being direct enough. It also does underline how well the visitors have defended.\n09:37 PM GMT Here's a good read on THAT first goal A comprehensive overview on the ruling, why it was ultimately given and plenty for you to agree and disagree with.\nREAD: West Ham’s goal vs Arsenal sparks fresh Var controversy – was the ball in or out?\n09:34 PM GMT 57 mins: Arsenal 0-2 West Ham West Ham haven’t won at the Emirates since 2015 and have since lost all eight of their visits.\n09:33 PM GMT GOAL! Arsenal 0-2 West Ham\nMavropanos with a brilliant bullet header from a corner. No one is stopping that, it came off the bar and the post. The quality of the delivery from, yep, you’ve guessed it, Ward-Prowse was almost as good as the finish.\nGreat header from Mavropanos to give his side a two-goal advantage - Getty Images/Catherine Ivill 09:31 PM GMT 53 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Bit more direct from Arsenal as RIce decides to let fly from 25 yards, it just goes over the bar.\nMeanwhile, the weather looks filthy...it’s pouring down.\n09:30 PM GMT 52 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Martinelli gets in a cross from the left. It’s easily defended but the hosts could do with more of that (the crossing bit, rather than the easily defended bit). Everything has been in front of the West Ham defence so far and it’s time for Arsenal to at least try ask another question of it.\n09:27 PM GMT 50 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham More neat passing from the hosts but there’s more than a hint of ‘after you, Claude’ about it. One pass will sometimes do rather than seven or eight...\n09:26 PM GMT 47 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Arsenal need to inject a bit of urgency, they have created half-chances but few out-and-out opportunities. More decent, patient passing sees the hosts win a corner.\nCan they make this set piece count? ‘Not really’ is the answer as the ball is pinged to Trossard on the edge of the area. As the Belgian shoots he’s challenged and takes a fair-but-firm hit. He’s down for bit, but gets up gingerly...\n09:22 PM GMT 45 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham This is the fourth time Arsenal have been 1-0 down at the break, they didn’t win on the previous three occasions.\n09:10 PM GMT So what you thinking? In or out?\nHere’s an article on the rule that the whole ball has to be out for the goal to be crossed off. Remember last year’s World Cup when a Japan goal against Spain sent Germany out? Very similar situation to today and possibly worth a half-time read...\nWhy Var allowed Japan’s goal to stand, what the rules say and why it mattered\n09:07 PM GMT HALF-TIME: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham That’s it for just another controversial Var-inflicted half. Arsenal have been, in terms of possession and territory, the dominant side but have been perhaps too intricate for their own good. West Ham took their one chance and thanks to Var are a goal to the good.\n09:05 PM GMT 47 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham More brilliant close control from Odegaard on the edge of the box, he drags the ball back and flicks it through to Jesus before West Ham crowd out the Brazilian.\nArsenal have played well but they could be more direct and really put the West Ham centre-back pairing under pressure. The odd cross etc etc won’t do any harm.\n09:01 PM GMT 45 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham There will be five minutes added time, which after the long wait for a decision about the goal seems too few...\n09:00 PM GMT 43 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Here’s a stat...\nPasses in the final third.\nArsenal 154, West Ham 13.\nBut the only stat that matters has Arsenal with no goals to West Ham’s 1...\n08:58 PM GMT 41 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham West Ham give the ball away in their own half and this allows Arsenal to be more direct - two passes and the ball is at the feet of Saka inside the box his lets fly and hits the near post. They’re 1-0 down but plenty to please the Arsenal fans.\n08:56 PM GMT 40 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham More neat, intricate play from Arsenal, Rice finding Odegaard who finds Saka but still no end product. However, keep passing it like this and you fancy the hosts to score sooner rather than later.\n08:54 PM GMT 38 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham It’s all Arsenal at the moment, they’re passing the ball around well, prodding and probing but struggling to create what yu’d call a gilt-edged chance.\n08:53 PM GMT 35 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham The hosts are knocking on the door once again. They have about three chance to pull the trigger before Martinelli hits it inside the box and the attempt goes wide. There was good build up between Odegaard, Saka and Jesus before the Brazilian shot. Still no goal/equaliser but promising signs for Arsenal .\n08:51 PM GMT 33 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Better from Arsenal, they’re seeing more of the ball and again probing away this time Zinchenko delivers from the right and it glances a team-mate’s head before going off for a goalkick.\n08:48 PM GMT 31 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham And Paqueta’s match is over. It looked rather fanciful that he’d manage a whole 90 when he went down in the warm-up and the Brazilian is off after 31 minutes. He’s replaced by Benrahma.\n08:46 PM GMT 30 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Good save from Areola as Jesus plays a delightful cross inside the box to Saka whose first-time header is heading towards the back of the net until the West Ham keeper gets a good hand on it.\n08:45 PM GMT Let the arguments commence The still of the byline decision 08:43 PM GMT 25 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Free-kick for the hosts just outside the area on the left. And Odegaard and Trossard try something cute - passing to each other on the move to work a shot closer to goal - before ending up with egg on their faces. They lose the ball and West Ham regroup.\n08:41 PM GMT Here's what Mark Clattenberg had to say On Amazon Prime Sport.\n“The on-field decision is a goal, so they have to find conclusive evidence that the ball has gone out of play. From the angles I have seen, the ball looks to be slightly in play.”\n08:40 PM GMT In or Out? Well, well, well!\nThe Emirates is stunned as West Ham break the deadlock thanks to Tomas Soucek! #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/R2T3jkcB1j\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023\nVAR couldn't find conclusive evidence that the ball went out of play, so West Ham lead ⚒️ #PLonPrime #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/OfqE7nyKro\n— Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 28, 2023\n08:38 PM GMT 21 mins: Arsenal 0-1 West Ham Arsenal seemed well on top before that goal and lengthy stoppage, both of which has put an end to the hosts’ building momentum.\n08:35 PM GMT GOAL given Good work from Paqueta on the left before the ball comes into the box. Bowen latches onto it and delivers from the byline allowing the lurking Soucek to score from close range.\nThe Var team took an age BUT they did not have a great camera angle to work with. If you’re an Arsenal fan you think it was out, if a West Ham supporter then it was defo on...\nThe on-field decision was goal and so without definitive confirmation the goal is allowed to stand.\nSoucek scores after some byline issues that Var sorted out - Getty Images/Marc Atkins 08:31 PM GMT There is a Var check for... ...whether the ball went over the byline in the run up to the goal....\n08:29 PM GMT GOAL! Arsenal 0-1 West Ham\nAgainst the run of play the visitors are ahead through Soucek .\n08:28 PM GMT 10mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Arsenal are combining well in the final third and again Odegaard is the orchestrator. He plays in Martinelli in the inside-left channel, the Brazilian lays it off to Zinchenko whose shot, from outside the box, is over the bar.\nThe hosts are knocking at the door and it wouldn’t be a shock to see a goal in the coming minutes.\n08:25 PM GMT 9 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Free kick for the visitors after Zinchenko goes to ground and brings down Coufal. It’s in the final third on the right and one for Ward-Prowse you suspect. Call me Nostradamus, as it is indeed the set-piece expert who crosses, Arsenal deal with the threat well.\n08:24 PM GMT 8 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham More good stuff from Odegaard who is at the heart of everything good about the hosts so far. He links with Martinelli before the Brazilian wins a corner on the left.\nCan they make this set piece count? ‘Nope’ is the answer as the delivery doesn’t beat the first man. Criminal...\n08:22 PM GMT Odegaard in the mood Very fast start by Arsenal, with Martin Odegaard already looking like he is in the mood. The Arsenal fans have been cheering Declan Rice, playing against his former club of course, more than anyone so far. They have been urging him to shoot whenever he gets the ball.\n08:21 PM GMT 6 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham Arsenal having a bit of joy down the right - they’ve already had three backheels on that flank - and this time sees Saka dink one into the box from the byline. The cross just goes long, but promising signs for the hosts.\n08:19 PM GMT 4 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham First move of real threat from Arsenal and it’s a beauty. Odegaard and Saka combine brilliantly on the right with the Norwegian flicking the ball into the path of his team-mate whose shot is saved with relative season by Areola.\n08:17 PM GMT 2 mins: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham First shot of the match goes the way of West Ham. The ball comes out to Ward-Prowse on the edge of the area and the midfielder volleys over. If there’s one player you’d want a chance such as that to fall to it would be him and he may well think he should have got that on target.\n08:15 PM GMT 1 min: Arsenal 0-0 West Ham They’re under way at the Emirates, Arsenal are in their traditional red and white kit and West Ham in their less traditional blue number.\n08:12 PM GMT Good news for West Ham fans It looks as though Paqueta will start. It looked as though he’d twisted his knee and that that would be his evening over. But he’s walking out onto the pitch for the pre-match rituals and will start.\n08:08 PM GMT Having given some good news for Arsenal fans I feel I should, for the sake of balance if not this being the season of goodwill, do the same for you West Ham folk reading this.\nAlas, I cannot. For this I am sorry and in fact I only come with bad news...it seems as though Lucas Paquetá has injured himself during the warm-up and doesn’t look too good. More news as it comes.\n08:06 PM GMT For you Arsenal fans reading this Here’s a bit of early good news for you.\nSpurs are currently 2-0 down at Brighton. You can follow that match here .\n08:02 PM GMT The January transfer window is about to open And Arteta has said that Arsenal will dive into the market if the right player was available. They’ve long been associated with a possible move for Brentford’s Ivan Toney and a look at the scoring form of Jesus would indicate why a No.9 might be on the shopping list. The Brazilian has scored three goals in 13 matches this season and could do with finding the back of the net tonight.\nJesus is having a lean season in front of goal - Getty Images/Richard Heathcoate 07:50 PM GMT Look at the table And you’ll see West Ham sitting pretty in sixth spot. So you’re doubtless thinking the fans cannot get enough of David Moyes, the man who won the club a rare bit of silverware only this past summer.\nBut such is the complete bonkers nature of modern-day football, and the fickle nature of fans who increasingly act like petulant four-year-olds when things don’t go their way, that Moyes is still the subject of the odd bout of boos. Remarkable really...\nThe thrashing at Liverpool in the cup helps go some way to explaining the lack of love for Moyes, and here’s a decent read on the (slightly unreal) situation in east London.\nREAD: Limp surrender at Liverpool shows why West Ham fans are split on David Moyes\n07:43 PM GMT Arsenal come into this on the back of the 1-1 draw at Liverpool Anfield is a ground they have struggled in the recent past but showed the sort of resilience and character that, whisper it, wins you titles.\nHere’s a good read from my friend and yours, Daniel Zeqiri, on how the north Londoners weathered the Liverpool storm and hinted at a bright rest of season.\nREAD: Arsenal spent 10 minutes in Anfield’s washing machine – but did not shrink\nArsenal opening the scoring through Gabriel on Saturday - Getty Images/Chris Brunskill 07:26 PM GMT Fancy a flutter? Having a bet on today’s match? First take a look at these free bets and betting offers .\n07:24 PM GMT The two XIs in black and white ARSENAL XI TO FACE WEST HAM: Raya, Saliba, White, Gabriel, Saka, Odegaard, Jesus, Martinelli, Trossard, Zinchenko, Rice. Subs: Ramsdale, Nwaneri, Elneny, Nelson, Jorginho, Soares, Kiwior, Nketiah, Smith Rowe.\nJust the one change for the hosts as Mikel Arteta brings in Leandro Trossard for the suspended Kai Havertz.\nLeandro Trossard starts for the hosts - Getty Images/David Price WEST HAM XI TO FACE ARSENAL: Areola, Coufal, Ward-Prowse, Paqueta, Kudus, Mavropanos, Alvarez, Bowen, Ogbonna, Soucek, Emerson. Subs: Fabianski, Cresswell, Johnson, Cornet, Fornals, Ings, Benrahma, Kehrer, Mubama.\nAlso just the solitary change for West Ham. Kurt Zouma is not in the squad and it’s Angelo Ogbonna who not only returns but also captains the side.\nAngelo Ogbonna captains West Ham this evening - Getty Images 07:18 PM GMT Here be West Ham Our team to take on Arsenal ⚒️ pic.twitter.com/5bcuyt6VDI\n— West Ham United (@WestHam) December 28, 2023",

    "title": "First responders urge river safety after dramatic rescue of child and adult on Dan River",
    "text": "First responders are reminding residents of what to know and do before entering the water after a family's fun day on the Dan River took a frightening turn earlier this week when a child went under, and so did the adult trying to rescue them. Thankfully, both made were rescued.\nFirst responders, it happened on Monday afternoon at Madison River Park on the Dan River when a child got caught in the river’s current. When a parent jumped in to help, they ended up needing to be saved too.\n“This year, this has not happened very often. This was the most critical call we’ve responded to this year,” said Rodney Cates, Director of Rockingham County Emergency Services\nA nearby witness jumped in to help pull the adult out. First responders got there fast, performing CPR and getting the adult breathing again before taking them to Cone Health Moses Cone Hospital. Both the parent and the child were saved from what could have been a fatal incident, but the child’s condition hasn’t been shared yet.\nRockingham County Emergency Services Director Rodney Cates advises that the best way to stay safe is to wear a life jacket, as it could be the difference between life and death.\n\"Everybody that gets on this river, it is paramount that they wear personal flotation devices (PFDs), the inner tubes can puncture. As you can see, there are many elements out here that can puncture an inner tube. So that personal flotation device is what is going to keep that person afloat,\" said Cates.\nThis graph of the river water levels from Rockingham County officials shows that on Monday, the river was almost 4 feet high. Today, it’s more than a foot lower.\nThat’s why Cates mentions people planning to go in the water need to check weather conditions before going out.\n\"The river is not going to get tired; even the person in the best physical condition will get tired and be taken under at some point,\" said Cates.\nCounty officials say you can also find real-time updates from Duke Energy and local emergency first responders. But most importantly, remember to wear a life jacket and check the weather conditions the day you go on the water. Also, know the route you’re taking on the river and its exit points.",
