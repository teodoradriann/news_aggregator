    "text": "It feels like we've got an epidemic of \"pastors\" who have never once cracked open a Bible and who have most certainly never read an epistle from the Apostle Paul.\nThe latest example is this United Church of Christ \"minister\" from LA who thinks the resurrection may or may not have happened. But, honestly, she doesn't care.\nWell, do I think that it (the resurrection) could have happened and did happen? I believe so ... I feel it probably did.\nOkay, great! Stop right there. Don't say another word. Drop the \"probably\" and move on, you're doing okay!\nBut no, she continues.\nBut if I'm to be scientific or realistic I don't know. And I say that because there's no 'proof,' there's no 'proof.'\nDid it really happen? ... Did Jesus really raise from the dead? I don't know.\nThis is where CS Lewis would insert a \"Your Affectionate Uncle, Screwtape.\"\nTo make matters (somehow) worse, she decided to double down.\nIf Jesus didn't physically raise from the dead and ascend, it doesn't change a thing about my love of God and Christ and Christianity ... because I truly believe in my heart of hearts that my faith is a resurrection faith ... come to Easter service and hear a heretical sermon!\nWell, she got that last part right!\nJesus' ressureaction doesn't matter to you? It wouldn't change your faith?\nWhat did the Apostle Paul have to say about that?\nI Corinthians 15:14-17\n'And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up — if in fact the dead do not rise. For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!'\nRead the Bible, Reverend Pat!\nP.S.

    "title": "Annual Christmas Lecture to feature engaging science TV show host, podcaster, and NASA communicator Michelle Thaller",
    "text": "Michelle Thaller, former assistant director for science communication at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, will unveil how we can use infrared energy to see “hidden light” of the universe during the fourth annual Christmas Lecture on Friday, Dec. 6 at South Bend’s Century Center.\nHer talk, “The Hidden Reality: Exploring the Invisible Universe with the James Webb Telescope,” will engage the young and old alike. This marks the first time the Christmas Lecture is presented outside the Notre Dame campus, and will begin at 6:30 p.m. after the tree lighting during Downtown South Bend’s (DTSB) holiday celebration. The Century Center is located at 120 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.\nThaller, who holds a doctorate in astrophysics, said she loves science, but enjoys it most when she can describe it within a story. Being a science “whiz” isn’t a requirement for anyone wanting to get into the field.\n“I actually didn’t do particularly well in my science classes,” said Thaller, who earned her undergraduate degree in astrophysics from Harvard University. “If I can’t put a piece of knowledge into a narrative structure, it kind of slips out of my mind.”\nShe has made science storytelling central to her career. In addition to her role at NASA, Thaller hosted Discovery Science Channel’s How the Universe Works from 2007-2015 and the podcast Orbital Path from 2015 to 2018. For NASA she worked with scientists on how to appropriately describe their work to many different audiences, and helped others write for the non-scientist crowd.\nDuring her interactive, high-energy talk, Thaller — who hosted the release of NASA’s first images from the James Webb Space Telescope — will share some of the beautiful images from that instrument. She will also demonstrate how infrared instruments help astronomers “see” into the depths of the Universe.\nShe enjoys working with middle school children, and fully remembers her sense of awe and wonder when she watched Carl Sagan’s Cosmos series by age 10.\n“Carl Sagan’s show was all about stories,” she said. “Science wasn’t just standalone knowledge. It was these wonderful narratives about discovery, from how stars were made to what Einstein was doing as a teenager.”\nThis love for storytelling shaped her approach to science communication, leading her to emphasize the human side of astronomy. “The personalities in astronomy — Albert Einstein, Cecilia Payne, and countless others — have incredible stories,” she said, highlighting Payne’s pivotal discovery that stars are made of hydrogen.\nThaller likes to stress to her younger audience members that it takes a variety of different approaches to learning in order to be a scientist. Girls, especially, may feel or be told that they aren’t “good” at math, and that can be damaging.\nAfter earning her bachelor’s degree in astrophysics from Harvard University, she completed her doctoral degree at Georgia State University. She once earned a D in a course on differential equations, but became competent by continuing to work at it.\nThaler also learned that because her brain works a little differently than some of her colleagues, people turn to her to solve different types of problems.\n“I put together unrelated ideas better than I think a lot of my colleagues do,” she said. “They would come to me and say they’re writing this proposal, and we need to bring in these different ideas and we’re not sure how to link them, and I was able to show them how there’s a story here and that one part leads to another.\"\nShe landed her job at NASA in a circuitous way. A specialist in massive stars in binary systems — systems in which two objects orbit around a common center of mass — she sometimes studied stars in the southern sky, which led her to telescopes in Australia and South America.\nIn Australia, she met and fell in love with another astronomer, who would become her future husband, and “he and I were trying to figure out how to be on the same continent,” she said. After her postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Montreal, both astronomers were offered jobs at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. She began in the infrared astronomy group’s public outreach program, and soon realized that communicating about astrophysics was the job she was meant to have.\nThaller, who has started a new job as an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, is looking forward to sharing all the amazing sights that the James Webb telescope can “see.”\n“When I was a practicing research astronomer, things that we sort of surmised were going on, with stars being born and dying, are something we can see with the James Webb,” she said. “I never thought I’d actually literally see them!”\nModeled after the Royal Institution’s Christmas Lecture series, the Christmas Lecture aims to inspire general audiences with the curiosity and wonder of scientific inquiry. Her talk will be accompanied by specialty cookies, a hot chocolate bar, and will be followed by a Q+A between her and Kate Biberdorf, aka Kate the Chemist, who gave the 2023 Christmas Lecture. Guests will want to stay for the entire event, because there’s a special surprise at the end!\nOriginally published by science.nd.edu on November 21, 2024.",

    "text": "Trees for Nipissing continues to plant trees in the North Bay area. On September 14th a group of volunteers from various local TD branches took part in TD Tree Days. It's the fourth year for the initiative which was held at the Marsh Drive landfill site. Close to 30 volunteers worked for 2.5 hours as they planted 400 trees. Peggy Walsh Craig, Chair of Trees for Nipissing, says its an important event that many of the volunteers look forward to. \"The reason we're doing this at the former landfill is because that site is eroding into Chippewa Creek, and people are using that land with their ATVs and snowmobiles,,\" said Walsh Craig. \"That's okay, but they make so many new trails all the time that contributes to the erosion. So we don't mind that they use that land, but we would like it to be a little bit less trailed up, as you might say, so we can work at restoring the land to the forest that it once was.\" Walsh Craig says they planted all native species of trees and had all ages of people participating. \"There was, I think the youngest was two and a half, and the oldest was in late 70s. And the TD Tree Days, the organization is always very impressed with how many trees we get in the ground for the number of volunteers that we have.\" This is one of a handful of Trees for Nipissing tree planting events the group is coordinating this fall. In the end, these initiatives aim to restore land and create lasting memories for volunteers",

(WFSB/Gray News) - A firefighter who was plowing the snowy streets of Trumbull, Connecticut, jumped into action to rescue four people and three dogs when he happened upon a house fire.\nWFSB reports Shaun Bogen’s quick actions were credited with saving the lives of the victims.\nThe Long Hill Fire Department said the house fire on Haviland Drive began just before 4 a.m. Sunday.\nWhile he was on the plowing route, Bogen discovered a house with a fire in the garage, according to the fire department. Bogen radioed into his base to alert them of the fire and called 911.\nBogen then sprung into action, waking up the four sleeping residents and their three dogs and making sure everyone was outside before the fire department arrived.\nA total of 26 firefighters responded to the fire, and the first unit to arrive found the fire most heavy in the garage and extending into the home.\nThe firefighters brought the fire under control in less than one hour.\nOfficials said there did not appear to be any injuries.\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\nCopyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Nous sommes à Ighri, une commune rurale de la province de Taroudant où, comme dans d’autres contrées du Maroc, des ménages dévalorisés ont commencé à recevoir le premier versement des aides sociales directes. Octroyées à une périodicité mensuelle à des familles en situation de fragilité ou ayant des enfants en âge de scolarité, et ne bénéficient actuellement d’aucune assistance sociale familiale, ces aides ont pour but de soutenir leur pouvoir d’achat, d’améliorer leurs conditions de vie et leur offrir un filet de protection sociale.\nDans cette localité, Le360 a recueilli des déclarations et impressions de certains bénéficiaires. Brahim Sellak, est l’un d’eux, forgeron de métier, marié et père de trois enfants. Heureux d’avoir pu recevoir cette aide bienvenue, l’homme nous explique son parcours pour atteindre à ce résultat. « Nous avons d’abord effectué l’enregistrement, moi et ma femme, ainsi que nos enfants, au caïdat. Nous nous sommes enregistrés ensuite sur le site Internet », détaille-t-il.\n« Alhamdoulillah (louange à dieu), nous sommes parmi les premiers dans le douar à recevoir cette aide. J’ai perçu 600 dirhams. Cela peut servir à payer la facture d’eau et d’électricité, et acheter un sac de farine. Ce n’est pas rien », poursuit-il.\nLire aussi : Aide sociale directe: à Jerada, forte affluence dans les bureaux administratifs pour s’inscrire au programme\nMême son de cloche auprès de Zaïna Boukharouach, octogénaire énergique à la frêle silhouette écrasée par le poids des ans, mais à la bonne humeur contagieuse. « J’ai reçu 500 DH. Cet argent m’a été très utile. J’ai payé la facture d’eau et d’électricité et j’ai acheté des légumes. Il me reste encore 300 DH. Cela peut servir à acheter de la farine, du savon, un peu de viande et de légumes, ainsi qu’une bonbonne de gaz et des vêtements », énumère-t-elle avec un enthousiasme palpable.\nPar M'hand Oubarka Le 07/01/2024 à 18h32",

    "title": "'I was not expecting this': Lowell Police unions replace teen's stolen e-bike",
    "text": "LOWELL — The situation might have looked a bit bleak recently for Lowell High student Nam Phan. But in the end, members of the Lowell Police Department came together to show Phan that good things do happen to good people. The discouraging incident occurred on Oct. 14. Phan had spent that Saturday afternoon helping out with a much-needed trash cleanup in Downtown Lowell. When the sophomore wrapped up for the day, he returned to the spot where he locked up his electric bike only to find it was gone. Stolen. An electric bike, or e-bike, is a bicycle equipped with a motor to assist the operator as they pedal. The motor receives its power from a rechargeable battery. The bikes tend to cost hundreds of dollars. Left with the broken remains of his bike lock, Phan assumed he was out of an expensive e-bike, which he used regularly as a primary means of getting to school, work, wrestling practice and home. “I was so angry because that day I had to walk home,” Phan said in a press release about the incident. Police said City Manager Tom Golden’s office received word of Phan’s stolen bike, and reached out to the Lowell Police Officer’s Union and the Lowell Police Superior Officer’s Union. After hearing the upsetting news, the unions, led by Lt. Aidan O’Donnell and Officer Timothy Roussell, decided to use union funds to buy Phan a new bike of the exact make and model that was stolen. Roussell said it was an easy decision, pointing out youth like Nam, who is in the ROTC at Lowell High, “are an asset to our community.” “He’s displayed a good attitude and a positive work ethic, and he was giving back to the community when he had something bad happen to him,” Roussell said. “We felt it was important to show him that good things happen to good people.” On Dec. 19, school resource officers from Lowell High escorted Phan to Lowell Police headquarters on Arcand Drive, where the sophomore was presented with the new bike — an Ancheer electric bike. Phan was also thanked for his work helping clean up the city. “The men and women of Lowell Police Department invest in the City’s youth on a regular basis, so when City Manager Golden’s office reached out to tell us about this young man’s e-bike being stolen while he was volunteering his time to clean up his city, it was a no-brainer,” O’Donnell said in the release. Phan expressed gratitude for the new bike, adding, “I was not expecting this.” “But these guys came out and did all this for me and I’m really grateful,” Phan said.
