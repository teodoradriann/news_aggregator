    "text": "Posted Dec 29, 2023 05:53:14 AM. Last Updated Dec 29, 2023 05:53:18 AM. As Maritimers prepare to welcome in the new year this weekend, they are also dealing with a messy weather day. A freezing rain warning is in effect for Colchester, Cumberland, Pictou and Antigonish counties on the mainland and the western half of Cape Breton. Environment Canada says freezing rain is expected through most of the region early this morning, with the precipitation changing to snow in some areas in the afternoon, mainly over higher terrain. It will also be messy in New Brunswick today, and a snowfall warning has been issued for areas like Moncton and southeast New Brunswick, which should see 15-20 cm of snow after several hours of freezing rain. A freezing rain warning remains in effect for Fredericton and Saint John. A snowfall warning has also been issued for PEI, with Prince and Queens County on the island looking at 15-20 cm of snow today. In HRM, 15-25 mm of rain is expected through the day, with winds gusting as high as 70 km/h",

    "title": "How to protect yourself from deepfake-based UPI frauds",
    "text": "Deepfake UPI frauds: An understanding Deepfake UPI scams are cyber fraudsters using artificial intelligence to create fake audio or video that convincingly resembles a real person's face, voice, or body language. Scammers often use these faked outtakes to impersonate family members, friends, or even business executives to request instant money transfers via UPI. Because the voice and images look real, the victims may bypass their usual verification process, making it easier for fraudsters to quickly transfer funds. How criminals conduct these scams The attackers normally begin with gathering available photos, videos, or voice recordings of the victim on social media, online profiles, or video calls. Then, they use AI-based software to create realistic-sounding fake videos or audio. The attacker makes a video call on messaging app or social media with the victim, posing as a person they know, and provides a reason for an urgent payment. They normally display a UPI QR code or payment link, leveraging the emotional reaction of the victim so that rational checks can be bypassed. Warning signs to watch out for Even the most sophisticated deepfakes will contain minute flaws. Watch for abnormal face movements, lip-sync problems, or irregular blinking. For voice deepfakes, you may detect strange pauses, robotic-sounding voice, or off-key background noises. Be wary if the individual is demanding cash payment immediately without allowing you to authenticate, or if they demand keeping the exchange private. Another flag is receiving a call from a new or unknown number while presenting yourself as a known individual. Preventive steps for individuals Verify the person's identity twice before handing over any money, especially for high-urgency transactions, with an independent mode of communication—such as calling their registered number or checking in person. Share as little personal data, photos, and videos online as possible to make it harder for criminal syndicates to create realistic deepfakes. Use strict privacy settings on social media and enable additional verification steps within your UPI app, such as app-based PINs or biometrics, to discourage unauthorized transactions. The role of awareness and reporting Sensitizing colleagues, relatives, and friends about the dangers of deepfakes can make them less prone to deepfake fraud. If you are sure that you have been targeted or are the victim of a deepfake UPI fraud, report to your bank's fraud helpline and the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in) simultaneously. The earlier it is reported, the more likely you are to freeze the fraud transactions and trace the origin. Being proactive not only protects yourself but also others as it makes it possible for the authorities to trace evolving fraud patterns. FAQs Q1: Can deepfakes circumvent the security aspects of UPI? Yes, deepfakes target the human component of trust, forcing you to perform a transaction yourself. While UPI systems are safe, social engineering can lead to losses. Q2: How do I know if a payment request for a video call is legitimate? Always hang up the call and contact the person through his/her known number or email and confirm the request before making any payment. Q3: Are there legal actions against deepfake creators in India? Yes, creating or employing deepfakes for cheating is illegal under the Information Technology Act and Indian Penal Code and can lead to imprisonment and fines.\",",

    "title": "Tristen Newton’s name now next to Shaquille O’Neal, David Robinson on NCAA’s all-time triple-double list | Basketball | lancasteronline.com",
    "text": "HARTFORD, Conn. — UConn point guard Tristen Newton‘s triple-double tendencies have him in some heady company when it comes to the NCAA’s all-time leaderboard. Newton is already the Huskies’ all-time leader in the stat, having posted the fourth triple-double of his career in a win over Villanova on Saturday. No other Husky has more than two. And now, he’s approaching Big Diesel territory. Newton’s four triple-doubles are the most by a power-conference player since Shaquille O’Neal, who posted six while at LSU from 1989-92. The fifth-year guard is also one of only 17 players in NCAA history to have posted four career triple-doubles. Newton is currently tied with Basketball Hall of Famers David Robinson (Navy), Jason Kidd (California), and current NBA superstar Ja Morant (Murray State). If he can rack up one more triple-double, he’d move up to a tie for fourth — as one of only eight players in history to record five in his career. Here’s a look at the current list: NCAA all-time triple-doubles list — Kyle Collinsworth, BYU (2010-16), 12 — Michael Anderson, Drexel (1984-88) 6 — Shaquille O’Neal, LSU (1989-92) 6 — Brian Shaw, St. Mary’s (CA)/UC-Santa Barbara (1983-88) 5 — Kevin Roberson, Vermont (1988-92) 5 — Shawn James, Northeastern/Duquesne (2004-08) 5 — Vonterius Woolbright, Western Carolina (2021-24) 5 — Tristen Newton, East Carolina/UConn (2019-24) 4 — David Robinson, Navy (1983-87) 4 — Jason Kidd, California (1992-94) 4 — David Edwards, Georgetown/Texas A and M (1989-1994) 4 — Adonal Foyle, Colgate (1994-1997) 4 — Stephane Lasme, Massachusetts (2003-2007) 4 — Jesse Sanders, Liberty (2008-2012) 4 — Ja Morant, Murray St. (2017-2019) 4 — Chandler Vaudrin, Winthrop (2019-2021) 4 — Gerald Lewis, SMU (1989-93) 4 Fittingly, Newton has also been named to the Oscar Robertson Trophy Watch List as U.S. Basketball Writers Association Player of the Year. ‘The Big O’ set some triple-double records of his own during his NBA career, becoming the first player ever to average one for a full season in 1962. Still, not even The Big Aristotle could have predicted the impact that Newton would have when he transferred to UConn from East Carolina in 2022. It’s amazing to think that last Feb. 29 (four years ago), Newton was a sophomore at ECU, facing the Huskies in one of the final games of the regular season. He scored 25 points, dished out six assists and grabbed five rebounds in that game, an 84-63 win for the Huskies. When he announced he would enter the transfer portal at the end of the following season, Dan Hurley and his staff were all over him. In just two seasons in Storrs, Newton has carved out a unique place in school history, so much so that The Daily Campus’ Cole Stefan is already arguing he deserves a spot in the Huskies of Honor. Newton and the Huskies have bigger things on their minds than the triple-doubles leaderboard, but his prodigious talent in that category is almost fitting for the strange yet brilliant college career he’s had thus far. ©2024 Hartford Courant.

    "text": "Invece di andare a lavorare nei parchi e giardini della città che gli erano stati assegnati, si fermavano per ore in un bar nei pressi di parco Due Giugno. Per questo motivo due ex giardinieri della Multiservizi sono stati denunciati, uno è stato licenziato e l’altro invece al momento solo sospeso.\nLa truffa\nI due sono stati anche sanzionati penalmente per truffa aggravata e peculato d’uso e hanno ricevuto una multa pari a 2.900 euro l’uno.\nMultiservizi\nRicordiamo che Multiservizi è una delle municipalizzate attenzionate in seguito all’inchiesta “Codice Interno” e che proprio la questione personale è quella che è stata ritenuta “vulnerabile” dal prefetto e per la quale la stessa azienda ha da tempo messo in atto una azione definita dal sindaco Vito Leccese di “self-cleaning” apprezzata dal ministero e che si sta portando avanti.",
