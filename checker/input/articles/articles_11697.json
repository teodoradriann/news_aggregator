    "title": "Hughesnet’s Satellite Internet Is Getting Faster. Why That’s Good News for Rural America",
    "text": "Hughesnet’s Satellite Internet Is Getting Faster. Why That’s Good News for Rural America The company's Jupiter 3 satellite improves the ISP's speed and data offerings across its entire US footprint. Hughesnet is bringing faster speeds to its satellite internet offerings -- a major upgrade for many Americans who rely on satellite internet based on where they live. For many Americans, particularly those in remote rural areas, [satellite internet](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-satellite-internet/) is the only way to get online. Availability is pretty much the only advantage to satellite internet, but customers often have to settle for higher pricing, lower speeds, limited data allowances and high latency (that’s the communication delay between two points, in this case, your home and the satellite, when sending and receiving data) compared to other [internet connection types](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/internet-connection-types/). [This story is part of Crossing the Broadband Divide, CNET's coverage of how the country is working toward making broadband access universal.](/crossing-the-broadband-divide/) However, Hughesnet hopes to alleviate some of satellite internet’s shortcomings by introducing faster speed tiers that include more data. Pricing will be relatively low, starting at $50 to $95 per month, but the faster speeds and increased data make for a much better value than previous Hughesnet plans. There’s also the potential for lower latency, low enough to support online gaming, thanks to Hughesnet’s Fusion technology, which combines satellite internet with low-latency fixed wireless connections. Locating local internet providers The launch of [Jupiter 3, a bus-sized geostationary satellite](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/hughes-bus-sized-satellite-promises-better-broadband-in-the-boonies/), made the new service tiers possible. It offers up to four times the download speed than previous standard Hughesnet plans -- a jump from 25 megabits per second to 100Mbps. Upload speeds will see a less impressive spike, rising from 3Mbps to 5Mbps. Data allowances, meanwhile, increase from between 15GB and 100GB per month to between 100GB and 200GB. The new offerings won’t have anyone switching from their [fiber-optic connection](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-fiber-internet/) or [cable internet](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-cable-internet/) service. But they could make quite a difference in [rural internet](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-rural-internet/) quality and capabilities for people who are beyond the reach of cable and fiber service. The faster speeds give rural residents the potential to do more with their internet, such as connecting more devices or streaming TV in a higher picture quality with less buffering, and the increased data means they can do more online before hitting a data cap. Locating local internet providers Hughesnet has a great track record for delivering its advertised speeds, earning praise from CNET as the [best satellite ISP for reliable speeds](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-satellite-internet/). That’s an encouraging sign that it will also deliver on the new, faster speed tiers. Here’s a look at those plans: New Hughesnet plans and pricing Plan | Starting monthly | Max download speeds | Max upload speeds | Priority data | Equipment fee | ---|---|---|---|---|---| Select | $50 ($75 after 12 months) | 50Mbps | 5Mbps | 100GB | $15 monthly or $300 purchase fee | Elite | $65 ($90 after 12 months) | 100Mbps | 5Mbps | 200GB | $15 monthly or $300 purchase fee | Fusion | $95 ($120 after 12 months) | 100Mbps | 5Mbps | 200GB | $20 monthly or $450 purchase fee | Source: Hughes Network Systems. Elite and Fusion advertise the same speeds and data, so why the difference in price? Select and Elite plans use a satellite-only connection. The lengthy time it takes your modem to communicate with the satellite (latency) can affect browsing, streaming and video conferencing while online gaming is virtually impossible. Hughesnet’s Fusion plan, on the other hand, communicates with local fixed wireless towers, creating a satellite/fixed wireless hybrid service. Max speeds and data are the same, but latency is lower, supposedly low enough to support online gaming. The main advantage to Fusion, then, and why it costs a bit more, is that the technology shortens the distance your data has to travel, resulting in a better experience in many applications while also making online gaming possible. A speed boost where it counts The upload speed jump from 3Mbps to 5Mbps isn’t particularly impressive, but it’s worth noting that the typical household makes far more use of download speeds compared to uploads. Download speeds determine how fast you can download data, such as pulling up a [review of the latest iPhone](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-compelling-upgrade-with-my-favorite-iphone-feature-in-years/), browsing social media or streaming TV and music. [Upload speeds](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/fast-internet-download-speeds-arent-the-only-thing-that-matters-heres-why/) come into play when sending information to the internet, like posting to social media or hopping on a video call (though both activities often require upload speeds of less than 3Mbps). So, it makes sense that download speeds would get a bigger boost while upload speeds remain relatively unchanged. That’s what we use the internet for the most, so the increase from 25Mbps to 50Mbps or 100Mbps is a welcome improvement. Again, 100Mbps isn’t remarkably fast, especially compared to the new wave of [multi-gigabit plans](https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-multi-gig-internet-plan/) that offer speeds up to 10,000Mbps and higher, but someone wise once noted that speed is relative. For those in rural areas with painfully slow DSL speeds or satellite speeds, 100Mbps could unlock new ways to use their connection. An upgrade from 25Mbps to 100Mbps could mean the difference between streaming in standard definition or HD and possibly 4K picture quality. Faster speeds will also allow you to add more smart devices to your network, such as [streaming sticks](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-streaming-device/), [security cameras](https://www.cnet.com/home/security/best-home-security-camera/) or a [new Alexa speaker](https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/best-alexa-devices/), without compromising the connection quality of other devices. Faster speeds demand more data Let’s say you put those new speeds to the test and switch the Netflix streaming quality from standard to high definition. Your stream went from using about 1GB of data per hour to 3GB. In acknowledgment of the greater data need that comes with faster speed, Hughesnet also increased its monthly priority data allowances to help accommodate new and increased internet activity the faster speeds allow. The Hughesnet tiers offer 100GB or 200GB of data to use each month, compared to the 15GB to 100GB limit of prior plans. That’s a good chunk of data, but many households are likely to reach and surpass that limit, with an [average monthly use of around 587GB](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/report-internet-use-over-half-terabyte). Exceeding your priority data allowance won’t result in added fees -- Hughesnet plans have been and still are unlimited -- but using standard, unlimited data may come with slower speeds for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you can’t handle the slowed speeds, additional data “tokens” can be purchased in blocks of 2GB to 50GB for $3 to $50. New internet in time for the new year? Hughesnet introduced the new plans at the start of 2024. Available speeds and access to Hughesnet’s Fusion service vary by location. Existing Hughesnet customers may be eligible to upgrade their plan, but the change in service comes with a new 12-month contract or fulfillment of the current term agreement, whichever is longer.

    "text": "Tal como estaba previsto por el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) , este jueves el temporal llegó al sur de la provincia de Córdoba con fuertes ráfagas. En algunos sectores, como Río Cuarto, llegaron a los 125 km/h. En este contexto, hubo destrozos en varias ciudades: voladuras de techos, caída de árboles, cortes de cables y rotura de postes. LA TORMENTA CAUSÓ DESTROZOS EN CÓRDOBA Desde el Municipio de Río Tercero indicaron que la tormenta presentó ráfagas que llegaron a los 100 km/h, con precipitaciones de 40 milímetros. “Hasta el momento, no se reportan personas lesionadas ni evacuadas”, aclararon y pidieron a los vecinos “extremar precauciones”. A raíz del temporal, la fábrica de muebles El Algarrobo sufrió la voladura de su techo de chapas. Allegados al dueño del lugar trabajaron para tapar y recuperar los muebles que había en el amplio galpón. Mientas continúan relevando los destrozos que ocasionó el paso del temporal por Río Cuarto y la región, la tormenta continúa avanzando hacia el norte y desde Portal 5900, la estación meteorológica de Villa María, informaron que la celda se encuentra a unos 30 km de la localidad. A su vez, apuntaron que la peor zona con posibilidades de granizo va directo a Tio Pujio y James Craik. “En breve llega al frente de tormenta a nuestra ciudad de Villa María”, agregaron. En Bell Ville, personal de Defensa Civil está trabajando en varias emergencias por caída de arboles, postes, voladuras de portones de algunos galpones. EN FOTOS: EL PASO DEL TEMPORAL POR EL SUR DE CÓRDOBA En ese marco, se registraron voladuras de techos, anegamiento de calles y cortes en los servicios en Río Cuarto, Coronel Moldes y otras localidades de la zona. En Río Cuarto, se registraron voladuras de techos y árboles caídos. Distintos usuarios compartieron videos del paso del temporal, donde se levantó una gran cortina de tierra por las fuertes ráfagas, y en la localidad de Sampacho, que registró una gran caída de agua. En tanto, en la localidad de Coronel Moldes hubo una intensa caída de agua y granizo. También se reportaron lluvia con fuertes vientos en Laboulaye. TEMPORAL EN CÓRDOBA: LAS RECOMENDACIONES A TENER EN CUENTA Ante el fuerte temporal, las autoridades brindaron una serie de recomendaciones a los ciudadanos: - Evitar caminar, estacionarse o circular en vehículos durante la tormenta. - En caso de tener que conducir, hacerlo con máxima precaución, a una velocidad moderada y una distancia prudente de los demás automovilistas. Recordar que la lluvia disminuye la visibilidad y aumenta el tiempo necesario para frenar. - Retirar macetas ubicadas en altura y guardar chapas y demás elementos que puedan ocasionar accidentes. - Sacar la basura en los horarios que pasa el camión recolector, de lo contrario, guardar la bolsa hasta que pase la emergencia climática. - Mantener limpios los desagües y sumideros en techos y patios. - Usar calzado aislante y desenchufar los artefactos eléctricos domiciliarios en caso de tormentas. - Ante un accidente en la vía pública o domiciliario, comunicarse con el servicio de Emergencias Médicas Municipal al 107. - Por anegamientos de viviendas, árboles o postes caídos, llamar al 103 para poder comunicarse con Defensa Civil.",

    "text": "[United Kingdom](../) Man killed after car ploughed into crowd was a Good Samaritan helping a stranger A father-of-two who died after [a car ploughed in a crowd of people](//metro.co.uk/2023/12/28/man-dies-several-others-injured-car-hits-crowd-sheffield-20032138/) during a disturbance was a Good Samaritan who was trying to help a stranger, police have said. Christian Marriot, known as Chris, was out for a post-Christmas walk with his wife and two young sons in the Burngreave area of Sheffield when he spotted a woman lying unconscious in the street. Officers believe the 46-year-old left his family and stopped to provide first aid to the woman, before a car then collided with them both and a number of others. The woman is believed to have been involved in an altercation and several other people suffered injuries during the incident, including an off-duty midwife who had also stopped to help. Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Knowles of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This is an utterly heartbreaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life. ‘Chris leaves behind a loving family including his devastated wife and two young sons. We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy.’ Two men arrested in connection with the incident – one on suspicion of murder – remain in custody, the force said. Burngreave residents said the incident happened outside a house at the junction of College Close and College Court – two quiet cul-de-sacs of modern houses near Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital. Police had already been called to a violent disturbance in the street when the car ploughed into those gathered outside. Neighbours said the altercation was related to some kind of dispute between two families. Mr Knowles said: ‘Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out inquiries, including going house to house to gather witness statements. ‘There are people in that community who hold information which is vital to our investigation and have not yet given statements. ‘I want to be able to get to the bottom of what happened for Chris and his family. I need those people with information to do the right thing. If you don’t want to talk to us directly, you can use Crimestoppers and remain 100% anonymous.’ A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 55-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Both remained in custody on Thursday night. A police spokeswoman said the woman Mr Marriott was helping remains in hospital in a life-threatening condition. She said the off-duty midwife suffered minor injuries, another man received serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening and four further people – three women and a man – suffered minor injuries. Tarek Nayli, 49, said he came out of his nearby home to see fighting in the street, a number of injured people and neighbours telling him there were others trapped under a car. Mr Nayli said: ‘I heard a lot of sound, a lot of voices, a lot of shouting. ‘When I came out, I found people all gathering around and people fighting. ‘One guy had a lot of blood on his face.’ Mr Nayli said the car involved was already there by the time he became aware of the incident and the police arrived two minutes after he did. He said: ‘I saw people fighting on that corner before the police came and the car was already there. ‘The whole neighbourhood was out.” He said: ‘They said there were people underneath the car and when the police came they managed to get them out. ‘When the police came, they flipped the car over and they’ve taken two people out.’ Mr Nayli said one injured man was already sitting beside the car and a woman was also clearly hurt. Asked about the fighting he saw, he said: ‘I didn’t see any weapons but there was a lot of hitting and one guy had a stick.’ Mr Nayli said he only found out later that someone had died. He said: ‘It was very, very sad and also very upsetting and I couldn’t believe it. ‘All of a sudden you find people dead and a very big crime. This is a disaster.’ On Thursday morning, police continued to guard an extensive cordon around the close, which about a mile and a half from the city centre. The cordon was dropped later in the day as forensic officers and detectives continued their inquiries in the small semi-detached property.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nToda una patraña orquestada para deshumanizar a los nativos, ajenos a la supuesta modernidad y tolerancia de un estado artificial que los maltrata y asesina. Lo triste es que exista una gran masa que se deje engañar, sabiendo que a pocos kilómetros de las fiestas, de los campamentos amorosos, hay miles de personas masacradas. Mirar hacia otro lado, no hacerse preguntas, ser un egoísta...capitalismo puro\n[#3](c3#c-3) La verdad que sí, yo es que la veo y me entran ganas de tirar una granada de fragmentación en la cocina mientras está mi mujer y mis chiquillos dentro haciendo la comida juntos, echar lo que quede en la pala de una retro y que se lo lleven a la escombrera, luego reformar la casa y traérmela a ella a copular los dos en el salón.\nMuy sexy todo, muy a lo estilo Israel.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Por Gal Gadot igual sería exagerado pero por Natalie Portman no te digo que no.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Natalie Portman es americana, no israelita. Y ha hablado muy claramente en contra de las políticas del líkud.\n[#24](c24#c-24) Trágate la propaganda: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman\n[#3](c3#c-3) Pues será muy guapa, pero sabiendo cómo piensa y lo que defiende, a mí me da puto ascazo .\n[#23](c23#c-23) Eso convierte a la población israelí casi al completo en cómplices de crímenes de guerra y contra los derechos humanos.\n[#1](c1#c-1) La verdad, si llamas paja en el ojo ajeno a un genocidio, no consigo imaginar qué es para ti la \"viga\" en el propio.\nEn todo caso, el vídeo es muy recomendable. Como comenta [#2](c2#c-2) esto va más allá de poner a una chica sexy junto al coche que quieres vender. Quizá sea buena idea recordar algo que cualquier persona razonable ha podido pensar sobre el Holocausto: ¿cómo pudieron los alemanes aceptar algo así, y mirar para otro lado mientras sucedía?\nPues bien, resulta que ahora lo estamos viendo en directo, y es muchísimo más aterrador: tienes a buena parte de un pueblo que no sólo no mira para otro lado mientras acepta lo que sucede, sino que publican el genocidio con sus propios teléfonos, entre risas y vítores...\n[#14](c14#c-14) bueno, pocos alemanes lo conocían, en aquella época. Hoy en día todo Israel es consciente de lo que pasa.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Pienso que más bien preferían no saberlo. Muchos eran conscientes de que sus vecinos judíos desaparecían y no se volvía a saber de ellos, pero por miedo o por lo que fuese, aunque no fueran nazis, no preguntaban. Ya sabían que no era nada bueno.\nY efectivamente, hoy todos saben perfectamente lo que ocurre, por eso digo que aún me parece más aterrador.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Es como te dice [#2](c2#c-2). Es una sociedad total y absolutamente enferma, y eso solo se puede alimentar de gente enferma. Por muy Gal Gadot en bañador que sea, yo no voy a ir a pegarle dos tiros a una familia y quitarle su casa.\nNecesitan payasos que casi siempre acaban cometiendo algún tipo de asesinato.\nPropaganda nazi en portada de meneame.\nMas comentarios de esta noticia\nCómo Israel utiliza el sexo para vender el sionismo. (EN)\nMe ponen las judías pero a las israelíes las veo muy masculinas. Prefiero a las árabes.\nComo se nota las similitudes entre nazismo y sionismo. El \"nuevo judío\" es un calco del \"Herrenmenschen\".\n[#44](c44#c-44) Por ejemplo May Golan.\nShe is the child of a single Orthodox Jewish mother who made Aliyah from Iraq as a 3-year-old girl as part of Operation Ezra and Nehemiah\nCuantas generaciones quieres investigar? La comparación fácil declaraba a alguien impuro si había al menos un abuelo sospechoso, y te veo por el mismo camino.\nLa pérfida Sión.\nNo compro lo de llamar colonos a todos los judíos israelíes.\nMás del 40% de los judíos ciudadanos de Israel son de origen Mizrahi, es decir, habitantes de medio oriente, tan nativos como los palestinos. Otras fuentes dicen que son el 60%, especialmente si se suma a los sefardies\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews_in_Israel\nEso ya sin ir a la genética que dice que tanto israelíes como palestinos comparten orígenes genéticos asociados a esa tierra.\n[#20](c20#c-20) dicho de otra forma : la mayor parte de los israelís son colonos según tú definición.\nQue malas son las mates.\n[#21](c21#c-21) No. Ten en cuenta que muchos sefardies abandonaron España por países de Oriente medio, de los que también son originarios, hace 5 siglos.\nEso ya si ignoras que parte de los que regresaron de Europa ya lo hicieron a principios del siglo XX, hasta si solo los cuentas a ellos consideras colonos a gente que ya lleva varias generaciones allí.\n[#41](c41#c-41) May Golan, Miri Regev, Yariv Levin, Eliyahu.\nY sí, la mayoría de los apellidos políticos vienen de Europa. Tampoco es muy difícil de explicar por motivos sociológicos, espero que no sea necesario.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Mañana, mañana.... Cuando se creó el estado de Israel hace 80 años ya había una importante comunidad judía, algunos nativos y otros (los primeros sionistas) recién emigrados. No es un grupo extranjero que de repente decide anexionarse otro territorio.\nMuchos habían llegado a principios del siglo XX más o menos a la vez que un buen porcentaje de árabes de otros países de la región que emigraron a Palestina y ahora sus descendientes serán también palestinos, pero nadie dice que son colonos, y está bien que nadie lo haga porque tampoco lo son. Y antes de eso siempre hubo una presencia judía, aunque minoritaria, pero suficiente para decir que son originarios de esa tierra y algunos nunca la abandonaron, todo lo contrario de la definición de colono.\nestamos hablando de la parte sexi no de la parte belica....\nDe ser sera sado",

    "text": "Cemex announced today that it has signed a Network Partnership agreement with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to accelerate circular economy efforts in the built environment. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Network is the world’s leading circular economy network, working with ambitious, like-minded organizations globally. As a Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, Cemex will continue integrating and scaling circular economy principles into the cement supply chain through its Regenera business while leveraging science-based research, advocacy, and coalition-building initiatives to drive circularity forward in the building materials industry. “Since 2023, with the launch of our Regenera business, we have strengthened our focus on circularity as an essential component of our strategy. Through Regenera, we are providing circularity solutions to extend the life cycle of products and reduce the use of virgin materials,” said Fernando A. González, CEO of Cemex. “The Partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation presents a tremendous opportunity to further drive Cemex’s leadership in the transition of the built environment towards a circular economy.\" “The built environment sector has a huge role to play in the transition to a circular economy, and Cemex have shown their intent to be a key player by joining our Network. As a leader in the construction industry, we look forward to supporting their circular economy journey through this long-term collaboration and showcasing the potential of innovative circular practices within the building materials industry,” said Joe Murphy, Executive of the Business Network at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The United Nations found that in 2021 the buildings and construction sector emitted historic levels of CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately 37% of global CO2 emissions. Incorporating circular economy principles into the built environment can create more sustainable and livable urban areas, reduce global CO2 emissions from building materials by 38% by 2050, and enhance sector resilience to supply chain disruptions and raw material price volatility. A circular economy helps tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and other global challenges by decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. The Foundation is working to accelerate the transition to a circular economy, that is based on three principles driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. Cemex’s Regenera recovered over 9 million tons of construction and demolition waste (CDEW) in 2023, marking a 5% increase over the prior year. As a result, construction-related waste has been effectively utilized and treated as raw materials for aggregates in concrete production, reintegrating them into the construction value chain and reducing the environmental impact of the industry. Regenera is part of Future in Action, Cemex's program to achieve sustainable excellence through climate action, circularity, and natural resource management with the primary objective of becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. About Cemex Cemex is a global construction materials company that is building a better future through sustainable products and solutions. Cemex is committed to achieving carbon neutrality through relentless innovation and industry-leading research and development. Cemex is at the forefront of the circular economy in the construction value chain and is pioneering ways to increase the use of waste and residues as alternative raw materials and fuels in its operations with the help of new technologies. Cemex offers cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and urbanization solutions in growing markets around the world, powered by a multinational workforce focused on providing a superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies. For more information, please visit: www.cemex.com About the Ellen MacArthur Foundation The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is an international charity that develops and promotes the circular economy in order to tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. We work with our network of private and public sector decision-makers, as well as academia, to build capacity, explore collaborative opportunities, and design and develop circular economy initiatives and solutions. Increasingly based on renewable energy, a circular economy is driven by design to eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature, to create resilience and prosperity for business, the environment, and society.

Priestman denied any involvement, but did not attend Thursday’s 2-1 victory over New Zealand as FIFA — soccer’s world governing body — and the International Olympic Committee investigate.\nCanada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said in the COC release “additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.”\nHe added Priestman is suspended from her duties until the end of the tournament and the completion of the organization’s independent external review.",
