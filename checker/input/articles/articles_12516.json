    "title": "Mexico's Raul Jimenez back to his best ahead of Concacaf Nations League: How Fulham's faith aided return - CBSSports.com",
    "text": "Getty Images As they ready themselves for their Concacaf Nations League semifinal against Canada on Thursday night (10:30 p.m. ET on Paramount+ ), Mexico are deep in the heart of a debate any national side would want to have. Raul Jimenez or Santiago Gimenez, if not both, which of their star forwards should Javier Aguirre trust to lead the line for El Tri?\nIt is at this point that we note the unimaginability of Jimenez, now 33, being in the frame to start big matches for his national side four years ago, when he was in the early stages of recovering from the skull fracture he suffered in horrifying fashion when colliding with David Luiz as a Wolves player in November 2020. Much more recently than that, however, the idea that Gimenez, pulling up so many trees with Feyenoord that he has since earned a move to AC Milan, might still be vying for minutes with Jimenez in 2025 seemed scarcely credible.\nAfter all, it rather looked like the triumph for Jimenez would simply be getting back on the football pitch. He had made his return at Molineux but looked like a shadow of the player he had been before the injury. When his time at Fulham started slowly, it seemed clear that the forward who terrorized defenses on Wolves' promotion to the Premier League would be seen no more.\nNot so. As Jimenez himself put it earlier this season, he just needed more time.\n\"I came back a year after [the injury],\" he told Sky Sports in December, \"but I think I came back to my best version not too long ago.\"\nThat best version of Jimenez is still asking all the right questions of some of Europe's best defenders. The veteran joined up with his compatriots this month as one of just 13 players to have reached double figures of goals in the top flight this season, Fulham's faith in him emphatically rewarded in a season where his goals might legitimately fire them to the European places.\nThis is not the story of a middling forward hitting a streak of form and fortune either. Per Wyscout, he has put up a combined 14.03 expected goals and expected assists, the ninth-best tally in the Premier League this season. That eclipses some of the most talked about stars of recent months, a better underlying output than Matheus Cunha or even Chris Wood.\nHow Jimenez compares to other center forward's in the 2024-25 Premier League Just like before his injury, Fulham's No. 7 is effective in build-up and link play with his back to goal but in Marco Silva's front-footed side, Jimenez gets shots. A lot of them. No, really. More than Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah do per 90 minutes. Only Cole Palmer, Eberchi Eze and Noni Madueke take more than 3.75 shots per 90.\nFulham have trusted in Jimenez and, as Silva put it in January, that trust has been rewarded. More than just the output, the veteran striker has won praise for competing with Rodrigo Muniz for a starting spot in the right way, aiding his development even as he puts up a fight to stay in the Cottagers side for the biggest games. Jimenez has delivered in a fair few of those: his equalizer at Newcastle in a crucial win for Fulham's European prospects, the brace against Ipswich that saw him become Mexico's highest scorer in the English top flight, an elegant run outside then inside Jakub Kiwior to earn a draw against Arsenal.\nThe good news for Aguirre is that so far the Fulham form has carried over to the international stage. The brilliant free kick to put Mexico on course for a 2-0 win over the USMNT was something out of the ordinary, the poacher's striker at the back post against Honduras anything but. In both games, he got shots up. There are few more valuable traits a center forward can possess. For a time it looked as if Jimenez had lost that. Now there are only a handful in Europe's top leagues who can compare to him.\nHow to watch Mexico vs. Canada Date: Thursday, Mar. 20 | Time: 10:30 p.m. ET Location: SoFi Stadium -- Inglewood, Calif.

    "text": "La Copa Sevilla Tenis se está disputando en el Real Club de Tenis de la ciudad desde este pasado 1 de septiembre. La final está prevista para este domingo, por lo que tenemos por delante un fin de semana de tenis al más alto nivel en la ciudad.Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos Este torneo celebra su edición número 61, se trata del torneo con más prestigioso de Andalucía y el tercero de España, sólo por detrás del Conde Godó y el Master 1000 de Madrid. Este año también cuenta con la novedad de la tierra batida en sus pistas. Un terreno que ya han probado estos días grandes tenistas como Albert Ramos o Roberto Carballés. Santiago Pérez, director de la Copa Sevilla, ha atendido a 7TV para valorar el papel de este tenista y su importancia en la historia de este torneo: “Es favorito desde el momento en que ha sido finalista y campeón en dos ocasiones aquí”. El único inconveniente que se le puede buscar a este torneo es la fecha, que suele ser un problema a nivel logístico para los tenistas. De cara a la próxima edición, la organización se plantea cambiarlo: “Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos, llegan aquí con jet lag. Yo que hablo con ellos percibo lo complicado que es jugar un torneo como este cuando apenas han dormido tres horas”, añade Santiago Pérez a los micrófonos de 7TV. Aunque la Copa Sevilla se juega desde el año 1963, esta obtuvo la denominación de Challenger en el 1991, convirtiéndola así en puntuable para la ATP. A lo largo de su historia han pasado por sus pistas estrellas como Rafa Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz o Manolo Santana.

    "text": "WTVO Rockford Don’t get stranded in Illinois this winter, says car expert Jim Hagerty Thu, December 12, 2024 at 9:31 PM UTC 2 min read\nROCKFORD, Ill. (WTVO) – Although it’s still technically fall, arctic weather has arrived in the stateline.\nAnd with those nippy days, comes the need to winterize our cars and trucks so we don’t get stuck in the cold.\n“You want to make sure your tires are good, your anti-freeze, of course is good,” said Tim Javurek, owner of TJ’s Auto Center in Rockford. “Test your battery, washer solvent—all that stuff needs to be checked thoroughly to make sure that car is ready to go for winter.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Javurek says dead batteries are a leading cause of stranded motorists when temperatures start to drop.\n“Especially if they’re aging,” he said. “That’s another thing. If a battery checks good, it doesn’t necessarily mean that. Because of the age, it should be replaced.”\nValoria Robinson, of LaGrange, found that out the hard way Thursday morning.\n“I went to drop my daughter off at school and was preparing my day to come visit a friend out here in Rockford for her birthday,” Robinson said. “And as I got back home, my car battery died. So, I had to call my husband to come down and give me a jump. I went to AutoZone and had to change out the battery.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Having a plan to winterize a vehicle before the cold weather hits is always a good idea. Waiting until the last minute can result in unnecessary inconveniences and costs.\n“You have to be towed or jumped, or whatever,” Javurek said. “That’s a big inconvenience. If you have to take kids to school or whatever, what do you do? You’re stranded.”\nRobinson wasn’t stranded but the ordeal was certainly an inconvenience.\n“A $263 inconvenience,” she said.\nExperts say a vehicle’s battery should be changed every three to five years.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Claramente, desde entonces han podido viajar y vivir varias experiencias, de hecho la actriz ya conoce al hijo de Estrada, algo que sin duda hace las cosas mucho más series, pues es la persona más importante en la vida del actor.\nAhora en plena época navideña ellos compartieron uno de los mejores regalos que se pueda dar en esta época, solidaridad, compasión y nobleza, pues mostraron por medio de sus redes sociales como compartieron alegría navideña en un hospital. El lugar escogido por la pareja fue el Hospital Militar Central donde estuvieron compartiendo con los adultos y niños que tuvieron que recibir este día en medio del malestar.\nAlejandro Estrada compartió en sus redes sociales que “En esta Navidad quisimos visitar el Hospital Militar; visitar a los pacientes, a aquellos que en estas fechas están pasando por un momento difícil y dar las gracias a los héroes que siempre nos cuidan. Experiencias que enriquecen y valen la pena…”, junto con un video de lo que hicieron en su paso por el hospital.\nSe puede ver que ellos se toman fotos con algunos fanáticos que se encontraron en el recinto, estuvieron acompañados por algunos militares y claramente repartieron un par de detalles a todos los que se encontraban allí. Los comentarios no se hicieron esperar y en su mayoría eran personas felicitando a la pareja por tener un gesto tan noble con aquellos que más necesitaban un poco de alegría.\nAlgunos de los comentarios dicen, “Hermosos!!! Que la felicidad y la paz los acompañen. Muchas bendiciones”, “Gracias por acordarse de las personas que en estas fechas están en un hospital”, “Que energía y vibra tan bonita, Dios los bendiga. Feliz Navidad”, “Muchas bendiciones para esta hermosa pareja, y que gran labor”, “Parece que los conociera de hace años, son tan bellos y hacen una hermosa pareja”.",

    "text": "News PressBee .. canadian news today Watch the post from Temperatures expected to fall as low as minus 8C as week-long cold snap hits UK, Now to the details\nTemperatures are expected to fall as low as minus 8C overnight as a week-long spell of wintry conditions hits the UK.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued cold weather health alerts for all of England ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts have been issued from 12pm on Thursday until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely, the UKHSA said.\n(PA Graphics)\nTemperatures had been expected to fall as low as minus 8C in rural Scotland and northern England on Thursday night.\nThe Met Office also forecast cold weather in parts of Wales and rural spots in southern England, with between minus 4C and minus 5C expected.\nDan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There’ll be widespread frost across the country (overnight), from Land’s End to John O’Groats.\n“It will be comfortably below where we should be for this time of year and I would expect temperatures to hit minus 8C in parts of Scotland.”\nMr Stroud confirmed conditions should become warmer by the end of this weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.\nA chilly start to Friday, with snow and ice warnings in force for coastal parts of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland\nFrosty in the south beneath clearer skies, but cloudier further north, with wintry showers affecting parts of Scotland and windward facing coasts pic.twitter.com/vS5i770Agw\n— Met Office (@metoffice) January 2, 2025\nHe said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles.\n“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nThe NHS Black Country integrated care board has warned the public to “avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark”, adding people should keep hands free and wear shoes with a good grip.\nIn Herefordshire, the Wye Valley NHS Trust told people to “have sufficient food and medicine and take measures to reduce draughts in your home”.\nAge UK director Caroline Abrahams said the Government’s decision to limit the winter fuel allowance to only the poorest pensioners will be put “into sharp relief” by the cold snap.\nMs Abrahams said the charity had already been contacted by older people “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”.\nFrom this winter, only people on pension credit or certain other benefits will receive the winter fuel payments while more than nine million others are set to be stripped of the allowance.\nSlips, trips and falls become more likely during icy weather conditions, so it’s important to be mindful of the weather before setting off.\nKeep your hands free Wear shoes with good grip Avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark. pic.twitter.com/fb1NtZVRHO\n— NHS Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB) (@NHSinBlkCountry) January 2, 2025\nThe charity director said: “We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm, even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford.\n“The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling and there may be support available from your local council too.”Meanwhile, fresh weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office for ice ahead of a blast of snow over the weekend.\nThe yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland.\nIt will remain in place from 5pm on Thursday until 10am on Friday morning, and could make for difficult travelling conditions, the forecaster warned.\nA snow and ice warning is also in place covering parts of northern Scotland between 4pm on Thursday and 10am on Friday.\nA yellow warning is in place from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday and covers all regions of England, other than the South West, the majority of Wales and parts of southern Scotland.\nElderly people have been urged to stay warm (PA)\nAbout 5cm of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England, with as much as 20-30cm over high ground in Wales and the Pennines, the forecaster added.\nStrong winds could lead to snow drifts in some areas, and freezing rain as temperatures creep up could add to the risk of ice.\nMet Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”\nThe Met Office has warned people to be prepared and aware when travelling with longer journey times likely.\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across England, Scotland and Wales are impacted.\nPoor weather is currently affecting National Rail’s Northern and ScotRail services.\nA cold northerly airflow dominated the weather on Thursday with clear skies for many, but wintry showers in the north and east\nHere are the extremes for Thursday the 2nd January 2025 pic.twitter.com/TlBdTlClFy\n— Met Office (@metoffice) January 3, 2025\nIn Wales, buses are replacing trains between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThe yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland, so motorists and pedestrians alike are warned to be wary of icy patches on untreated roads, pavements, or cycle paths.\nOn Thursday, London councils activated an emergency accommodation protocol for people sleeping rough in freezing conditions.\nThe emergency measures, which see extra beds made available, have been active for three nights so far this winter.\nA major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down, with emergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts.\nThere have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.\nTemperatures expected to fall as low as minus 8C as week-long cold snap hits UK Canadian News Today.\ntemperatures expected to fall as low as minus 8c as week long cold snap hits uk\nPlease note that the original topic has been published and is available on canadian news today the editing team at PressBee have verified it and it may have been partially modified or quoted from it.
