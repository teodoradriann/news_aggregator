    "text": "pediatric-urgent-care As a parent, witnessing your child feeling unwell can be a stressful experience. Between managing daily routines and juggling work schedules, navigating healthcare options can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, for non-life-threatening illnesses and injuries, pediatric urgent care clinics offer a valuable solution. This blog serves as a guide for Munster parents, outlining the benefits of pediatric urgent care and providing information about Munster-based options.\nWhat is Pediatric Urgent Care?\nPediatric urgent care clinics are walk-in medical facilities specifically designed to cater to the needs of children. Staffed by healthcare professionals experienced in treating a wide range of childhood illnesses and injuries, these clinics offer extended hours compared to traditional pediatrician offices. Unlike emergency rooms (ERs), pediatric urgent care clinics provide a more comfortable and familiar environment for young patients, often leading to a more positive healthcare experience.\nWhen to Consider Pediatric Urgent Care\nPediatric urgent care can be a valuable resource for a variety of non-emergency situations. Here are some common scenarios where a visit to a pediatric urgent care clinic might be appropriate:\nSudden onset of illness: Symptoms of a cold, flu, ear infection, strep throat, or bronchitis.\nMinor injuries: Cuts, scrapes, sprains, strains, or minor burns.\nAllergies: Mild allergic reactions that do not require emergency intervention.\nStomach issues: Vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach aches.\nSkin concerns: Rashes, insect bites, or minor skin infections.\nEye infections: Pink eye (conjunctivitis).\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs): Burning urination or pain in the lower abdomen.\nAdvantages of Pediatric Urgent Care\nFaster Wait Times: Compared to emergency rooms, pediatric urgent care clinics typically boast significantly shorter wait times. This can be particularly advantageous for a restless child feeling unwell.\nConvenience: Extended hours, including evenings and weekends, cater to busy schedules and unexpected healthcare needs that arise outside of regular pediatrician office hours.\nPediatric Expertise: Staffed with healthcare professionals experienced in treating children, pediatric urgent care clinics provide a familiar and comfortable environment for young patients.\nCost-Effectiveness: Urgent care visits are typically less expensive compared to emergency room visits.\nWalk-in Appointments: Many pediatric urgent care clinics accept walk-in appointments, eliminating the need for pre-scheduling, which can be a significant advantage when dealing with unexpected illness or injury.\nWhen to Seek Emergency Care\nIt is crucial to recognize situations that necessitate a visit to the emergency room. Seek emergency medical attention if your child experiences any of the following:\nDifficulty breathing or chest pain. Severe allergic reactions (trouble breathing, swelling of the face or lips). Head injuries with loss of consciousness or persistent vomiting. Broken bones with deformity or severe pain. Deep wounds or puncture wounds. Seizures. Severe burns. Persistent vomiting or diarrhea accompanied by dehydration. Symptoms suggestive of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck). Poisoning or ingestion of foreign objects.

    "text": "Rational policymakers know something must be done to curb gun violence, especially the epidemic of mass shootings. But too many fear the political consequences of taking on the NRA and the gun manufacturers. Oklahomans were reminded of that reality earlier this month when Sen. Jessica Garvin, R-Duncan, introduced legislation for the 2024 session in response to last fall’s shooting death of a 16-year-old at a Choctaw High School football game. Garvin’s proposed Senate Bill 1254 would increase to a felony the unlawful possession of a gun on school property, punishable by a maximum $2,500 fine and one year in jail. “While it’s already illegal to carry a firearm on school grounds,” she said in a news release, “we determined the current state punishment is nothing more than a slap on the wrist.” Except, of course, the Choctaw tragedy involved teenagers whose brains aren’t yet fully formed (the alleged shooter was only 15). Anyone really believe teenagers are going to calculate the felonious consequences of packing heat? Reality screams otherwise. The real problem is too much access to too many guns, especially to firearms that can mow down dozens in the equivalent of a nanosecond. These are not the muskets of the era when the Second Amendment was crafted. Garvin’s proposal would do next-to-nothing to end the carnage, but it provides political cover when constituents demand to know what she’s doing to help ensure their safety in public spaces. What could help create serious dialogue about sensible gun control? Hitting gun manufacturers where it hurts – in their pocketbooks. A group of activist nuns recently showed the way in a Nevada court, filing a lawsuit aimed at pressuring Smith & Wesson to change the way it manufactures and markets its version of the AR-15 rifle. The nuns alleged company leaders are putting shareholders at risk, contending its marketing played “a significant role in contributing to many of the most heinous crimes in United States history.” Specifically, they cite ads that mimic video games “appealing to young, and predominantly male consumers of such games.” Legal experts disagree on the lawsuit’s viability, but it may be the only way to get gun manufacturers and their proxies in D.C. and in statehouses to negotiate sensible restrictions. How about Congress revive the federal assault weapons ban? Or Oklahoma lawmakers enact Red Flag laws aimed at helping frantic families and law enforcement get firearms out of the hands – at least temporarily – of troubled individuals who might harm themselves or others? Alas, Oklahoma appears nowhere near having such discussions – Garvin’s proposal notwithstanding. Remember, it was just three years ago that Oklahoma became the first state to enact an anti-Red Flag law. And Garvin’s SB 1254 quickly drew the ire of the Oklahoma 2nd Amendment Association’s president, Don Spencer, who declared, “This attack on our rights must be stopped.” When it comes to guns, unfortunately, many in the Republican-dominated Legislature take their marching orders from Spencer – and from zealots who wield disproportionate influence in GOP primaries and live in perpetual fear the feds are coming for their firearms. To her credit, Garvin earlier this year helped derail a proposal that would have required the state sever ties with firms discriminating against firearms and ammunition manufacturers. But like most Republican lawmakers, she still treads carefully around gun rights. “I’m pro-Second Amendment and have voted continuously to uphold this right for Oklahomans,” she insisted. “I’m also in strong favor of protecting the lives of children and others on our school campuses. This bill is about stopping this illegal activity and giving prosecutors the power to pursue more significant charges.” Stay tuned. – Arnold Hamilton is editor of The Oklahoma Observer; okobserver.org",

    "text": "India’s government has recently targeted high-profile journalists with Pegasus spyware, Amnesty International and The Washington Post said in a joint investigation published Thursday. Created by Israeli firm NSO Group and sold to governments around the world, Pegasus software can be used to access a phone’s messages and emails, peruse photos, eavesdrop on calls, track locations and even film the owner with the camera. Amnesty said journalists Siddharth Varadarajan of The Wire and Anand Mangnale of The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project had been targeted with the spyware on their iPhones, with the latest identified case occurring in October. “Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation,” said Donncha O Cearbhaill, Head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab. India’s government did not immediately respond, but it denied similar accusations in 2021 that it used Pegasus spyware to surveil political opponents, activists and journalists. Indian media reported last month that the country’s cyber security unit was investigating allegations by opposition politicians of attempted phone tapping after they reported receiving Apple iPhone warnings of “state-sponsored attackers”. In that case, Ashwini Vaishnaw, the information and technology minister, said the government was “concerned” by the complaints.",

Lo riporta il Washington Post spiegando che sarebbe da leggersi in quest’ottica l’evacuazione del personale non necessario dall’ambasciata a Baghdad e da altre sedi diplomatiche americane. Oltre che l’autorizzazione alla partenza volontaria dei familiari dei militari statunitensi dal Medio Oriente. Secondo il giornale, l’intelligence Usa sarebbe «sempre più preoccupata» relativamente al fatto che lo Stato ebraico possa decidere di colpire i siti nucleari iraniani anche senza il consenso di Washington. La notizia arriva mentre il presidente Donald Trump esprime deboli speranze di raggiungere un accordo con l’Iran che limiterebbe il suo programma nucleare e preverrebbe uno scontro militare in Medio Oriente. «Sono meno fiducioso ora di quanto lo sarei stato un paio di mesi fa», ha detto al New York Post.",

    "text": "SAN DIEGO — This Saturday marks five months since historic flooding impacted thousands of people across San Diego. Many families are still living in a hotel through vouchers but those expire Friday. CBS 8 has been in touch with the [Banks family since they lost almost everything](/article/news/local/san-diego-family-gets-ready-to-move-back-into-their-home-four-months-after-flood/509-0784ef07-e472-4f90-a4f3-eff4d51379b5) on Jan. 22. CBS 8 has followed them throughout the process of rebuilding and dealing with red tape. A few days short of living in a hotel room for five months, Robert and Judi Banks are finally home. “Starting all over again. It’s going to be rough, but we’re going to make it,” said Judi Banks. There are new walls with fresh paint, new flooring and there’s an aroma of beans simmering in their new kitchen. “Look at that baby, home cooked foods. Whoo hoo,” said Judi. Behind the closet door is a green washer and dryer, which is Judi’s favorite color. “I had to have it,” said Judi. As they give CBS 8 a tour of their remodeled home you can see it’s the little things, like a new bathtub, that make starting over a little easier. It’s hard to imagine that their home could be fresh and new. In January their entire Mountain View neighborhood on South 42nd Street was under water during an unprecedented storm. “Officers walking down through the water, wading through the water, carrying rowboats,” said Robert Banks. The Banks’ say before the rain, they complained to the city several times to clean out the storm channel behind their house. Thursday, crews were seen repairing the fence, but the Banks' worry about the weeds that are already growing in the channel. “I can’t go back to another flood, I’ll make sure they keep it clean,” added Judi. After the storm water receded, the Banks' were allowed back into their home. But it was caked in mud and the walls were soaked from the storm's water. “If it had not been for the volunteers and someone out there that knew what to do immediately, we would still be like the rest of the people,” said Judi. Many of their neighbors have not been able to return to their homes or they refuse to leave their house and are living among possible mold infested walls. “We still have work to do. I’m going to support all I can,” said Judi. The Banks have flood insurance through FEMA, which helped, but they say the process was slow. “Money from FEMA is, I’m going to say it’s worse than slow. It’s worse than a snail,” said Robert. Federal money didn’t cover all the work to properly restore their home. The Banks wish the City would do more to rebuild. “I have to give credit to my sons, because they kept their finances, kept us going so we didn’t have to stop,” said Judi. The Banks say what helped them to keep going was to have faith in their new beginning. “God has always taken care of his people. We’re his people,” said Robert. Officials says the County of San Diego dedicated $4.2 million in financial support from the and the San Diego City Council authorized an additional $3 million to support those who need assistance and will continue to partner with the inspiring community members who are working to support storm victims. While the Banks couple is giving families hope, there are several dumpsters and barricades that still line the street. You can see there is still a long road to recovery. The hotel and food vouchers expire on June 21. A County spokesperson says at the peak there were 900 families using the food and hotel vouchers and offering mental resources. Today there are 348 still using the hotel vouchers. The County says local Housing Authorities will be working with families on temporary housing. Families in the City of San Diego can apply for help and get more information online at floodassistance.sdhc.org, by phone at 619-578-7792 or by email at [floodrecovery@sdhc.org](mailto:floodrecovery@sdhc.org).
