Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Aryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina, Sloane Stephens and several other tennis players have reacted to the extreme temperatures they are currently practicing in ahead of the Brisbane International, with the mercury soaring above 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit).\nSeveral ATP and WTA players have landed in Brisbane in the middle of the Australian summer, to commence their 2024 campaigns at the 250 and 500 events, respectively. The tournament's main draw is scheduled from December 31–January 7, whereas the qualifiers are already underway. Meanwhile, those who have earned a direct entry to the main draw have started their on-court preparations.\nOn Friday, December 29, the likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina and Sloane Stephens took the practice court during the day session. They shared glimpses of their training while also highlighting that they were grappling with extreme heat .\nSabalenka, the top seed at the WTA 500 Brisbane International, revealed the temperature during her practice to be 37 degrees Celsius (approximately 99 Fahrenheit). 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and World No. 27 Anastasia Potapova, too, accorded with the World No. 2.\nMeanwhile, for former World No. 8 Daria Kasatkina, former World No. 1 Karolina Pliskova, and 2022 French Open semifinalist Martina Trevisan, the mercury nudged 38 degrees Celsius (over 100 Fahrenheit).\nKasatkina also showed her sunburned face to her fans on social media.\nAryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina and Sloane Stephens on Instagram Other tennis players on Instagram It is worth noting that the Australian Bureau of Meteorology had issued a ‘Severe Heatwave Warning’ for Brisbane on December 27, stating that the extreme conditions were expected to last through December 29.\nThis isn’t the first time that the tennis players have had to bear the brunt of the summer Down Under.

    "title": "Met Office severe warning for 75mph winds over New Year - Devon Live",
    "text": "The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning ahead of the New Year's weekend as the country recovers from Storm Gerrit. Just days after the storm wreaked havoc on roads, damaged properties and cut power across the UK, another band of powerful winds are set to strike the nation. The warnings covers the whole of the South West, parts of western Wales and the South English coastline. The Met Office has said this wave of bad [weather](https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/weather) is caused by an active cold front which will move eastwards on Saturday, December 30 and into New Year's Eve. The alert is in place from 11am on Saturday until 3am on Sunday morning. The Exeter-based forecaster says: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.\" There may be some disruption to road, rail, ferry and air transport services, power cuts and large waves along the coastline. \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain,\" the Met Office adds. \"Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\" It comes just days after similar conditions brought by Storm Gerrit. Parts of the UK faced winds of more than 80mph, with trees and scaffolding blown down by the powerful gusts. In Greater Manchester, around 100 properties were damaged by a 160mph 'tornado' which reportedly swept through the city. The warning is expected to end at around 3am on Sunday, December 31 and the strong winds are likely to weaken through the day and into January 1. Though the warning is just for wind, heavy rain is also expected the batter the region. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” What to Expect - Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely - It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves - Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer - Some short term loss of power and other services is possible - Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely",

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — A widespread rain will move into Central Texas for Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday evening. There could be pockets of heavy rain and embedded storms, but we are not anticipating any issues with severe weather. This is just the first round of rain for the week, and it will likely bring a widespread quarter-inch to 1 inch of beneficial rainfall. The second round of rain will move in on Friday. Models remain in strong agreement that another system will produce widespread showers and a few embedded storms, but we won't know the exact timing for another couple of days. As a result of both of these system, we're expecting most of the KVUE area to pick up a half-inch to one and a half inches of beneficial rain over the next seven days. This pattern is looking much more typical of an El Niño winter, and we hope it continues into the back half of January to improve our ongoing drought. The KVUE Weather Team will continue to monitor this developing forecast. In the meantime, the extended forecast can be found below:",
