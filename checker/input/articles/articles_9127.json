    "text": "Al menos una docena de jóvenes colombianos habrían sido engañados para migrar ilegalmente a España - crédito juanma Bat/Unsplash En la mañana del jueves 13 de junio de 2024, la Policía española confirmó el arresto de un ciudadano colombiano de 39 años radicado en el país europeo, acusado de favorecer la migración ilegal de jóvenes del país cafetero a territorio español.\nSegún informó la Agencia EFE , las autoridades lograron establecer el modus operandi con el que operaba el ciudadano para convencer a jóvenes colombianos, incluso algunos menores de edad, de migrar de manera irregular a España con la falsa promesa de facilitar su carrera profesional en el fútbol.\nAhora puede seguirnos en nuestro WhatsApp Channel y en Facebook .\nDe acuerdo con la información conocida, el arresto fue el resultado de una operación denominada Benji, que se llevó a cabo en Arrasate, municipio de Gipuzkoa, ubicado en el norte del país. El despliegue del operativo comenzó el miércoles 12 de junio, momento en el que el colombiano fue arrestado en su domicilio por agentes del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, aunque se negó a colaborar con las autoridades, por lo que fue puesto a disposición del Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucción Número 2 de Bergara para que investigue las acusaciones.\nLa primera alerta sobre la llegada de jóvenes colombianos bajo la modalidad de engaño se conoció el 22 de febrero de 2024, cuando la asociación SOS Racismo alertó a la policía sobre los posibles engaños que originaron la llegada de los cafeteros.\nEl hombre ofrecía la posibilidad de jugar en el país europeo a través de WhatsApp - crédito David Soto/Facebook Una vez iniciadas las pesquisas por parte de las autoridades españolas, el 9 de abril se logró dar con el paradero de jóvenes que explicaron que su permanencia en el país europeo estaba relacionada con la posibilidad de “jugar en equipos de fútbol”, por lo que en el momento de identificarse, los colombianos mostraron su pasaporte y un documento en el que se podía leer “carta de invitación”.\nComo parte de la investigación, dos jóvenes víctimas explicaron que llegaron a España luego de haber contactado por la aplicación de mensajería instantánea WhatsApp a un hombre colombiano que les ofreció la posibilidad, previo pago, de jugar con equipos profesionales, esto, porque “supuestamente tenía contactos en este mundo deportivo”, aseguraron en su declaración.\nLas autoridades lograron establecer que en las conversaciones el hombre solicitaba a los jóvenes colombianos un dinero de adelanto con el fin de cubrir los gastos de representación frente a equipos y directivos; como también, establecerlos en una vivienda y proveer la manutención, que ellos también debían pagar.\nAl momento de identificarse, los colombianos mostraron su pasaporte y una \"carta de invitación\" al país europeo - crédito Isabel Infantes/ REUTERS Las víctimas afirmaron que una vez llegaron al país europeo, el hombre los ubicó en casas en las que ya se encontraban otros jóvenes que, al parecer, también habrían sido engañados, pues lograron identificar que se encontraban en las mismas condiciones.\nComo resultado de las pesquisas, se conoció que, al menos, doce jóvenes habrían llegado a territorio español bajo el mismo engaño, por lo que ya fueron escuchados por las autoridades para esclarecer lo sucedido, aunque la Policía explicó que no se conoce el paradero de otros colombianos que son vinculados como víctimas a las investigaciones.\nLas autoridades capturaron al hombre el miércoles 12 de junio de 2024 en su domicilio - crédito Juan Moreno/Europa Press Colombianos migrantes en España De acuerdo con datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), entre enero y septiembre de 2023, Colombia registró el mayor número de personas que migraron a España, pues en los reportes aparecen cerca de 116.000 colombianos que decidieron establecerse en el país europeo, siendo Madrid el principal destino, con 25.110 llegadas.\nLos motivos detrás de esta tendencia son variados, pues la crisis económica y la falta de oportunidades laborales en el país cafetero fueron identificados como factores determinantes, dado que migrantes optan por viajar atraídos por el idioma común y están dispuestos a aceptar trabajos informales, frecuentemente de baja remuneración como, por ejemplo, limpiar apartamentos o distribuir volantes que pueden generar un pago de unos 10 euros la hora.\nDesde 2015, año en que se firmó un acuerdo bilateral entre la Unión Europea y Colombia que eliminó el requisito de visa para turistas, ha habido un incremento sostenido de migrantes colombianos, además de la búsqueda de mejores oportunidades laborales y la reunificación familiar, otros migran para huir de la violencia y la persecución en su país de origen, por lo que Migración Colombia también ha señalado que un número significativo de estos migrantes busca empleo en sectores como la agricultura, la construcción, el turismo y los servicios.",

Plaza.\nThe vandals spray painted the front of the building and plastered posters on the front door, police said. It was not immediately disclosed what was written on the posters.\nCops are calling the vandalism “bias criminal mischief.”\nWhile the homes of the Brooklyn Museum board members were also splattered with paint, the incident at the German consulate hasn’t been grouped in with any other acts of vandalism from Wednesday, a police source said.\nSurveillance video captured two women and a man walking near the scene. They fled the area in a dark colored vehicle.\nNo arrests have been made.\nVandals hit the homes of the Brooklyn Museum board, who live in both Brooklyn and Manhattan, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Wednesday. The Palestinian mission was vandalized around 6:15 a.m.\nThe German consulate was vandalized around 3:30 a.m., cops said. Attempts to reach the German consulate were unsuccessful Thursday.\nHundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters rallied outside the Brooklyn Museum on May 31, with some getting into the building and setting up tents. NYPD cops arrested 34 protesters during the raucous rally.\nThere has been a steady stream of protests in the city and across the nation since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking a ferocious war in Gaza.\nOn Monday, protesters rallied outside the Nova Exhibition, a memorial created to honor the victims of Hamas’ attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and took hundreds hostage.\nSome protesters waved a flag with Hamas’ emblem, as well as a sign lauding the massacre.\nMayor Eric Adams and relatives of those killed during the Oct. 7 terror attack visited the exhibition Tuesday, calling the previous day’s protest “despicable.”\nCops on Thursday released images of the vandals wanted for defacing Pasternak’s building asking anyone with information regarding their identity to step forward.",

    "text": "España prohíbe las bebidas azucaradas en las escuelas\n[Katia Giselle Olán Pérez](/autor/katia-giselle-olan-perez)\nEl ministro de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030, Pablo Bustinduy presentó un informe del estudio Alimentación, Actividad Física, Desarrollo infantil y Obesidad (ALADINO).\nAhora, los colegios en España tendrán la obligación que sus alumnos consuman diario de frutas y verduras frescas, y evitar el consumo de bebidas azucaradas en las comidas.\nFamilias con escasos recursos sufren excesos de peso\nUn comunicado del Gobierno, mencionó que los niños de familias con rentas más bajas presentan mayores problemas de exceso de peso debido al menor consumo diario de frutas y verduras, así como a un mayor acceso a bebidas azucaradas.\nEn el 2023, los resultados de un estudio muestran que más de un tercio de los niños entre 6 y 9 años padece exceso de peso, con un 20,2 % en situación de sobrepeso y un 15,9 % con obesidad. Aunque este porcentaje representa una reducción del 4,5 % respecto a 2019, la brecha entre las familias de menores y mayores ingresos sigue siendo alarmante.\n\"Esta situación es especialmente preocupante en las familias que ingresan menos de 18.000 euros al año, donde el exceso de peso infantil afecta a casi la mitad (46,7 %) de las niñas y los niños que forman parte de estas familias, frente al 29,2 % registrado en quienes pertenecen a familias con ingresos superiores a 30.000 euros\", añade el texto.\nEl consumo de frutas y verduras también refleja esta desigualdad: solo el 36,4 % de los niños en familias de bajos ingresos consume frutas a diario, frente al 53,6 % en familias con mayor renta. En cuanto a las bebidas azucaradas, el consumo regular es ocho veces más alto en niños de familias con menores recursos (7,8 % frente al 0,9 %).\n\"En una democracia y una economía avanzada como la española, la dieta y la salud de los niños y las niñas no puede depender del lugar donde se nace\", declaró el ministro.\nEl ministro también destacó la importancia de los comedores escolares para garantizar el acceso a una alimentación equilibrada.\nLa norma también asegurará que todos los comedores escolares, independientemente de su titularidad, garanticen tener carne y pescado de calidad en sus menús así como cereales y legumbres.\n[TAMBIÉN TE PODRÍA INTERESAR: ¿Qué hay en la Verbena Navideña del Zócalo 2024?
