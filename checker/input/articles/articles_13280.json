    "text": "A warming trend is in the forecast for much of British Columbia after several days of record-breaking temperatures, but the cold weather on the Prairies will continue.\nEnvironment Canada says temperatures are rising but snow flurries are in the forecast for the Metro Vancouver area, followed by rain later this week and temperatures well above zero degrees Celsius.\nTemperatures in Alberta are forecast to start to moderate today and through the week, but it will remain cold.\nCalgary and Edmonton have been experiencing wind chills as high as -50 C over the weekend, but Environment Canada says the daily low temperatures will drop to -21 C.\nEnvironment Canada says despite the somewhat warmer temperatures in Alberta, frostbite warnings will remain in effect.\nB.C.'s public power utility, BC Hydro, says the extreme cold drove peak hourly electricity demand across the province to a record high on Friday night, reaching 11,300 megawatts.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 15, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

Hay personas afortunadas que vienen con dos madres a este mundo, soy una de esas. Escribo de ella porque ayer mientras hablaba con mis hermanas sobre su muerte, les explicaba que hablar sobre alguien que ya no está, recordar las cosas que hemos vivido, hace que con el tiempo duela menos, es como si nuestras palabras la van colocando en un lugar de paz y nos permite tener paz a nosotras.\nCon los muertos es todo más fácil porque no hay reciprocidad, nos toca a nosotros despedirnos con las terapias o métodos que consideremos adecuados, pero es mucho más difícil decirle adiós a alguien que está en vida y con la que compartimos momentos importantes.\nDespedirse de quien ya no quiere compartir su tiempo con nosotros, en especial dándole forma a la enemistad, es frustrante y doloroso.\nHonro a todos los que se han separado sin una despedida a la altura. El orgullo nos lleva a lugares que a veces necesitamos, en especial a la soledad.",
