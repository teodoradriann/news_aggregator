    "text": "By Sarah Pridgeon Sundance Times Via Wyoming News Exchange ,\n2 hours ago\nSUNDANCE — Wyoming’s two senators are criticizing the U.S. Forest Service for its “chokehold” on the timber industry in the wake of the recent layoff announcement from Neiman Enterprises.\nU.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthis Lummis joined their South Dakota counterparts, John Thune and Mike Rounds, in calling for USFS to outline what it plans to do to protect the remaining forest products industry in the Black Hills.\nNeiman Enterprises announced layoffs and product reductions at its last remaining South Dakota facility, Spearfish Forest Products, in April.\n“This announcement came roughly three years after Neiman Enterprises was forced to close their sawmill in Hill City, South Dakota, upending the lives of another 120 hard-working individuals,” states the letter from the senators.\nIt also came a year after the company announced shift reductions in Hulett and reduced hours in Spearfish. All moves were attributed to a reduction in timber harvests.\nIn April, Shawn Cochran, Black Hills National Forest Supervisor, explained that the need for a reduction in timber harvests was caused largely by the mountain pine beetle epidemic, during which the forest exceeded its allowable sale quantity to address the issue, and a number of large, catastrophic fires that changed vast areas of the forest.\nThe USFS is currently undertaking an in-depth assessment of the timber situation, using real-time data from a lidar study that is being analyzed at Colorado State University with an eye to seeing results this summer.\nCochran said that the USFS will also continue its program to bring in timber from further-flung forests in California and southern Oregon.\n“Over the last two years, the USFS has invested $3 million in the timber transit pilot program…From what I gather, over 200 rail cars have moved nearly three million board-feet of timber to be processed at Neiman mills,” he said.\nBut the four senators want firm answers.\n“Unfortunately, dwindling sawmill capacity near our nation’s national forest is not unique to the Black Hills. Since 2020, more than 20 mills near national forests have been forced to curtail production or close altogether,” states their letter. “While the timber industry faces its own unique market pressures, the recent layoffs are a direct result of reductions to the U.S. Forest Service’s timber sale program. Inconsistent log supplies from our national forests undermine our local sawmills and it is unacceptable.”\nThe letter continues to state that, without a dependable and affordable supply of timber from the national forests, these businesses will not survive.\nIt points out that the timber harvest target for the BHNF sits at just over half the amount that the forest was able to cut and sell in 2023.\n“The layoffs at Spearfish Forest Products are a direct result of these drastic reductions in the timber sale program and reflect the tragic and all-too-real consequences of the Biden Administration’s misguided and harmful policies,” states the letter. “Across Wyoming and South Dakota, we are experiencing the impacts from this administration’s extreme climate obsession, resulting in efforts to lock up public lands and restrict multiple use mandates, regardless of the local economy.”\nIf the few remaining mills in the Black Hills are forced to close, the senators say, it will reverse years of progress. Forest health will suffer, wildfire risk will grow and damage from insects and diseases will become more likely, while the ripple effects will harm the economy, devalue forest grazing leases and jeopardize recreation opportunities.\n“The forest products industry is hanging on by a thread and continued reductions to the timber sale program cannot continue,” states the letter.\nThe senators claim that USFS has “not expressed interest” in finding solutions and instead encouraged the timber industry to invest in new equipment and retrofits that could process small diameter trees and other forest residuals. These materials, they say, have little commercial value.\n“You also suggested that the industry should consider moving away from producing lumber and transition to other by-products that could be used for construction,” states the letter. “Aside from the timber transport pilot program, which brought logs by rail from California to the Black Hills, we have seen no efforts to increase timber harvest levels or help the industry.”\nThe senators have demanded answers to five questions, beginning with what is USFS doing to increase timber harvest levels on the BHNF?\nIn addition, their letter asks for an explanation of the main drivers of the timber target shortfalls since 2018, what resources USFS needs to increase timber harvest levels – including specifics of any additional funding – and how many years it will take to ramp up harvest levels to the collaboratively identified target.\nFinally, the senators ask, “Will the agency commit to preventing further economic harm to the forest products industry by providing a consistent supply of timber?”\nThe USFS has been asked to provide written responses to these questions before June 28.",

    "text": "Scholz on Ukraine: Country at war cannot join NATO [Porokhnia Yana](https://www.liga.net/en/author/yana-porohnya) A country at war cannot become a member of NATO, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz [said](https://www.zdf.de/politik/maybrit-illner/bundeskanzler-olaf-scholz-bei-maybrit-illner-am-24-oktober-2024-100.html) in an interview with ZDF on 24 October. \"A country that is at war cannot join NATO. Everyone knows this, and there are no disagreements on this issue,\" said the German politician. He argued that it is sufficient that NATO member states have \"outlined prospects\" for Ukraine. At the moment, he does not see the need for a new decision. The chancellor also noted that an invitation to the Alliance is usually quickly linked to membership, and the German side does not support this idea, which is the first point in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Victory Plan. Scholz said that he maintains a \"cautious approach,\" as he seeks to ensure that the full-scale war in Ukraine does not escalate into a conflict between Russia and NATO. He also confirmed his stance that supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine, specifically Taurus, would be \"inappropriate.\" According to him, Germany will not provide weapons that could contribute to an escalation of the full-scale war. Recently, Politico, citing anonymous NATO and U.S. officials, reported that at least [seven countries oppose inviting Ukraine to join the Alliance](https://news.liga.net/en/politics/news/seven-countries-oppose-ukraines-invitation-to-nato-including-us-and-germany). The United States and Germany are reportedly leading this group, along with Hungary, Slovakia, Belgium, Slovenia, and Spain. Zelenskyy's administration [quickly refuted](https://news.liga.net/en/politics/news/ukraines-presidential-spokesman-refutes-claims-of-seven-nato-members-opposing-ukraines-invitation) this information, calling it false and asserting that the idea of inviting Ukraine to NATO is supported by an \"overwhelming majority.\"",

    "text": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said ‘bureaucracies’ such as the HHS became ‘wasteful and inefficient.’ The United States government has undergone a major shakeup since Donald Trump took office. Earlier this year, diversity, equity and inclusion ( DEI ) programs were slashed, and, most recently, the Department of Health and Human Services announced layoffs in an attempt to “restructure” the system. The department’s new secretary , Robert F. Kennedy Jr ., said that the HHS became “wasteful and inefficient” in a statement shared via the department’s website . “Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” Kennedy said in the statement. “This overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. That’s the entire American public, because our goal is to make America healthy again.” Below, learn how many HHS employees will be laid off. There were 82,000 full-time employees that worked for the Health and Human Services Department, according to its website. So far, 10,000 employees have left the department voluntarily, according to CNN , but there will be a total of 20,000 job cuts in the end. The HHS noted on its website that the “restructuring” will downsize the division from 82,000 full-time employees to 62,000. The HHS noted that the reduction in workforce will “serve multiple goals without impacting critical services” and “save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce.” “We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” RFK Jr. said in a statement. “This department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.” Additionally, the HHS plans to jettison “many redundant units,” noting that its existing 28 divisions will be reduced to 15, including a “new Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, and will centralize core functions such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Procurement, External Affairs, and Policy.” The restructuring is also part of the goal to implement the HHS’ “new priority” to end “America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water and the elimination of environmental toxins,” according to the department’s website.",

    "text": "桃園市龍潭區14日下午，一名43歲王姓男子在自家民生路住處，因為獨自搬移重達300公斤的重機時，重心不穩不慎摔倒，導致左腳踝被重機壓住無法動彈，王男疼痛難忍，用手機報警求助。警方與119救護人員到場後，合力將重機移開並將王男送醫，經檢查為腳踝骨折，所幸無生命危險。\n龍潭警分局說明，當日下午2時許，警員在巡邏時接獲報案，表示民生路發生自摔車禍，警方到場後，未見車禍現場，正要聯繫報案人時，屋內傳出哀嚎聲，立即進入屋內查看。警方發現王男倒臥客廳，左腳踝被重機壓住，神情相當痛苦；經了解，王男原本打算為愛車保養並更換機油，沒想到重機突然傾倒，左腳踝被重機壓住無法動彈，因無法自行脫困，他立即以手機報警。\n員警即刻合力將重機扶起，並通知119救護人員，經初步檢查，王男左腳踝骨折，救護人員與警方合力將他移上擔架送醫。此外，在送醫前王男擔憂家中無人看管，警方貼心協助關好門窗並上鎖，確保家中安全。王姓男子經治療後無生命危險，對員警及時救援表達感謝，直言「當下真的非常害怕，痛得動彈不得又無人援助，還好警方第一時間趕到並伸出援手，不然不知道還要受困機車下多久」。\n龍潭警分局分局長鄭文銘提醒民眾，無論在家中或戶外從事大型器械、重型機具操作時，務必評估自身體力與周遭環境安全，避免單獨進行高風險動作，以防發生意外時無人發現而延誤救援；同時也呼籲獨居者與鄰里保持良好互動，平時建立通報機制，有助於在緊急狀況中爭取寶貴時間，共同守護自身與社區安全。",

    "text": "[Weather](https://www.laprensalatina.com/category/weather/) 7 dead in south Thailand flooding Bangkok, Dec 29 (EFE).- Torrential rains have triggered severe flooding in southern Thailand, claiming seven lives and affecting thousands of people, authorities said Friday. The casualties were reported from the Narathiwat province that has borne the brunt, with water levels exceeding two meters in some areas. One person was missing as search operations are on. More than 260,000 people have been affected by the flooding, according to data from the government’s disaster management agency. Rescue efforts are underway. The water level exceeded two meters in some villages in Narathiwat, where residents took shelter on rooftops or upper floors of their houses, waiting for help from emergency services. Flood waters have already started receding little by little, while neighboring provinces of Yala and Pattani have also been affected, the public broadcaster Thai PBS reported. The floods forced the closure of some of roads that connect the region and the temporary suspension of the railway services, which has now resumed its normal activity. Some regions in neighboring Malaysia were also hit, and some 28,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, according to official data. Although the water level has begun to recede in some areas, the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that heavy rains would continue over the weekend. EFE nc-ssk",
