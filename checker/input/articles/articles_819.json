Image: Supplied by South Link Health After years of delays, a South Island healthcare provider is ready to build a new after-hours medical facility in Rangiora.\nSouth Link Health chief executive Karl Andrews said work can finally begin on the promised medical centre at the Rangiora Hospital and Health Hub site in Ashley Street.\nLocal residents have been growing frustrated by the wait for after-hours healthcare in North Canterbury, with local MP Matt Doocey demanding action in February on the stalled project.\nThe Waimakariri District Council confirmed it will invest up to $3.5 million in the medical facility at a closed-door session earlier this week.\nWork is expected to begin soon, with signage, fencing, and sod-turning expected in the coming weeks.\nSouth Link Health is proposing to build a new medical centre, which will include general practice services seven days a week with after-hours and urgent healthcare, radiology services including ultrasound, CT and MRI scans, and a pharmacy.\nMr Andrews said he anticipated the project will take 14 months to complete.\n‘‘We are ready to deliver this vital facility for the community,’’ he said.\n‘‘After facing several challenges, including Covid-19 delays, rising construction costs and commercial investment challenges, progress will soon be visible.’’\nSouth Link Health was formed by the Dunedin-based South Link Education Trust in 2010 as a not-for-profit healthcare provider.\nSouth Link Education Trust will loan fund 50 percent of the construction costs, with the council loan funding the remaining 50 percent.\nThe trust will be responsible for repaying both loans.\nTrust chairperson and chief clinical advisor Murray Tilyard said the organisation is thrilled to partner with the council on this ‘‘vital initiative’’.\n‘‘North Canterbury urgently needs robust, seven-day-a-week extended primary healthcare services, and we are committed to delivering them.’’\nWaimakariri Mayor Dan Gordon said the council has received independent advise from PwC New Zealand (Pricewaterhouse Coopers), which confirmed its own feasibility study.\nThere will be no cost to ratepayers, he said.\nUnder the agreement with South Link Health, Mr Gordon and Deputy Mayor Neville Atkinson will represent the council on the project delivery group to oversee the build.\n‘‘This is an essential step forward for healthcare in North Canterbury,’’ Mr Gordon said.\n‘‘Our communities have long been waiting for access to urgent and after-hours healthcare, and now we can ensure it will happen.’’\nMr Gordon paid tribute to retired Rangiora GP Dr Lorna Martin, who has been a driving force behind the project over several years.\n‘‘Although she has retired and is no longer directly involved, her unwavering support has been invaluable in helping us reach this point.\n‘‘I would also like to recognise Murray Tilyard’s personal commitment to this initiative.\n‘‘His passion and perseverance have been pivotal in bringing this project to fruition.’’\nThe Ministry of Health entered into a lease agreement with South Link Health in 2021 to build an after-hours facility at the Ashley Street site.\nBut it has been beset by delays, due in part to Covid-19.\nSouth Link Health had been trying to extend the lease from 35-years to 50-years to ensure a better return for its funding partners.\nBut this would have required Te Whatu Ora Health NZ to subdivide the site in accordance with the Resource Management Act.\nThe council has already issued resource and building consents to allow the build to proceed.\nLast year, South Link Health announced the merger of its two Rangiora-based practices in anticipation of the new facility.\n■ For now, North Canterbury residents requiring urgent after-hours care are advised to contact their GP to speak to a triage nurse, or access a telehealth provider (for a charge).\nDurham Medical in Rangiora and Amberley Medical Centre offer Saturday morning clinics.\nKa Ora Telecare, which offers phone or video consultations with a doctor, is available to some North Canterbury residents, go to kaora.co.nz/app/services/sub-services/3.\nResidents can also access the Pegasus 24-Hour Surgery in Christchurch or call 111 in an emergency.\nBy David Hill, Local Democracy Reporter\n■ LDR is local body journalism co-funded by RNZ and NZ On Air.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "A [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) enfrenta uma paralisação significativa depois de o maior sindicato de trabalhadores da empresa iniciar uma [greve](https://revistaoeste.com/tag/greve), interrompendo a produção de seus jatos mais vendidos. É a primeira greve em 16 anos. Milhares de operários que montam os modelos 737, 777 e 767 abandonaram seus postos de trabalho logo depois da meia-noite da sexta-feira 6, horário do Pacífico, depois de rejeitarem um acordo trabalhista negociado entre os líderes sindicais e os executivos da Boeing. O contrato oferecia aumentos salariais de 25% ao longo de quatro anos. Os líderes do International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, que representa 33 mil membros, afirmaram que cerca de 94% dos trabalhadores votaram contra o contrato e 96% decidiram pela greve. Os dirigentes sindicais disseram que buscarão retomar as negociações com a empresa. A paralisação ocorre em um momento financeiro delicado para a Boeing, que enfrenta problemas de caixa e aumento da dívida depois do acidente com um 737 MAX da Alaska Airlines em janeiro, quando uma tampa de porta se soltou em pleno voo. A greve prolongada pode agravar ainda mais a cadeia de suprimentos da indústria e aumentar a escassez de jatos para as companhias aéreas. As ações da Boeing caíram cerca de 4% nas negociações pré-mercado. “Acreditamos que não estamos pedindo mais do que merecemos”, disse Marcus Amador, logo após os trabalhadores abandonarem o trabalho na fábrica de Renton, Washington, [Estados Unidos](https://revistaoeste.com/tag/estados-unidos), onde a Boeing monta o 737. Ele gritou sobre os cânticos dos grevistas, apoiadores e buzinas de carros. “Já se passaram 16 anos”, disse Amador, inspetor de qualidade, referindo-se ao tempo desde o último acordo trabalhista. Ele afirmou trabalhar na empresa há 13 anos. A insatisfação dos trabalhadores da Boeing Os trabalhadores da Boeing manifestaram várias preocupações na quinta-feira ao votar nos salões sindicais locais. Muitos disseram que os aumentos salariais propostos eram insuficientes após uma década de salários estagnados e aumento do custo de vida no noroeste do Pacífico. Um empregado destacou que o salário inicial sob o novo contrato — US$ 21 por hora— era semelhante ao de uma rede local de hambúrgueres, Dick’s Drive-In, que oferece seguro de saúde gratuito e correspondência de 401(k). “Você pode ganhar mais dinheiro virando hambúrgueres”, disse ele. Os membros do sindicato da Boeing nunca haviam rejeitado um contrato recomendado por seus líderes. O último acordo trabalhista foi em 2008, resultando em uma greve de 57 dias que paralisou a produção e custou à Boeing cerca de US$ 100 milhões por dia. Os sindicatos obtiveram grandes conquistas no ano passado, em parte devido às greves na indústria automobilística e entre escritores e atores de Hollywood. Em 2023, os EUA registraram greves que envolveram cerca de 540 mil trabalhadores, mais que o dobro do ano anterior, segundo a Escola de Relações Industriais e Trabalhistas da Universidade Cornell. O CEO da Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, que assumiu o cargo no mês passado, pediu aos trabalhadores que não fizessem greve. “Peço que não sacrifiquem a oportunidade de garantir nosso futuro juntos, por causa das frustrações do passado”, disse ele em uma mensagem. Ortberg visitou fábricas na região nos últimos dias e conversou com trabalhadores. Durante a semana, protestos ocorreram na fábrica e fora das plantas. “A mensagem foi clara de que o acordo provisório que alcançamos com a liderança do IAM não foi aceitável para os membros”, afirmou a Boeing em um comunicado. “Continuamos comprometidos em redefinir nosso relacionamento com nossos funcionários e o sindicato, e estamos prontos para voltar à mesa de negociações para alcançar um novo acordo.” Tentativa de acordo Os líderes sindicais haviam fechado um acordo com a Boeing no domingo, depois de semanas de negociações tensas. Além dos aumentos salariais, o contrato melhoraria os benefícios de aposentadoria, reduziria os custos de saúde e comprometeria a Boeing a construir seu próximo avião no noroeste do Pacífico, uma demanda crucial do sindicato. O acordo, no entanto, não alcançou a linha-dura do sindicato, que incluía um aumento salarial de 40% ao longo de quatro anos. “Embora houvesse muitas coisas importantes nesta oferta, ela não preencheu a lacuna de 16 anos passando por duas extensões, as ameaças de perda de emprego, salários estagnados, o aumento dos custos de saúde e muitas outras questões”, disse Jon Holden, presidente do capítulo do IAM, depois de anunciar a contagem dos votos. Holden afirmou que o sindicato consultará seus membros para definir suas prioridades na esperança de alcançar um acordo que possa ser ratificado. Sob o acordo rejeitado, a taxa salarial base dos trabalhadores aumentaria 11% neste ano, elevando a taxa horária mínima para entre US$ 20 e US$ 37, dependendo da posição. O contrato previa aumentos de 4% no próximo ano, 4% em 2026 e 6% em 2027. A Boeing disse que os salários médios aumentariam 33% ao longo de quatro anos devido aos aumentos por antiguidade. + Leia mais notícias do [Mundo](https://revistaoeste.com/mundo/) em Oeste",

PHOTO: REUTERS Sapna Maheshwari UPDATED Jan 10, 2025, 08:28 AM Thanks for sharing! The impending disappearance of TikTok, one of the most popular social media apps in the United States, has sent marketers, agencies and creators racing to embrace alternatives – even if they’re not entirely convinced that TikTok will in fact exit the United States in January.Marketers are shifting dollars to Instagram and amending their contracts with social media stars so they aren’t stuck paying for sponsored TikTok posts in the app’s absence. Creators are pleading with fans to follow them elsewhere while collecting their email addresses to connect on other platforms. And talent agents are telling TikTok stars to hit pause on buying a house or car for now.“I’m just hitting 30 million followers, and 10 days from now I might lose it all,” said Mr Joe Mele, 26, a TikTok star from Long Island, New York, who started posting jokes when he was a college freshman. “It’s a little scary.”TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is trying to overturn a law, signed by President Joe Biden in April 2024, that calls for ByteDance to sell the app to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States on Jan 19. TikTok has claimed a sale is impossible and challenged the law as unconstitutional. It will make its last legal argument in the case on Jan 10 before the Supreme Court, after losing its case in a lower court.",
