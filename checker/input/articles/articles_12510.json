    "text": "The death of a New York City professional dancer who died after eating mislabeled cookies sold at a supermarket chain in the northeastern United States was 'devastating and preventable,' a family lawyer said Thursday. Orla Baxendale, 25, of Manhattan, died Jan. 11 of anaphylactic shock after a severe allergic reaction to a cookie manufactured by Cookies United and sold by Stew Leonard's, according to a statement obtained by USA TODAY from the New York City-based law firm. The firm of Geyer, Geyer, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackoff. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Norwalk, Connecticut-based Stew Leonard's recently recalled Vanilla Florentine Cookies sold at Stew Leonard's in Danbury and Newington, Connecticut, with dates from November 6 to December 31, 2023. informed of. The cookies contained peanuts that were not listed as part of the ingredients, the law firm wrote. Baxendale's death was caused by the “gross negligence and reckless conduct” of the manufacturer and sellers, who failed to properly identify the cookie's contents on the packaging,” the firm's attorney Marijo C. Ademi told USA TODAY via email. “This failure to make appropriate disclosures led to this devastating but preventable outcome,” Adeyemi wrote. “Instead of standing up and taking full responsibility, as the public would have expected him to do, Stu Leonard engaged in a public relations media campaign.” Baxendale, originally from East Lancashire in the United Kingdom, moved to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a world-class dancer, Adeyemi said. Vehicle Recall:Kia recalls more than 100,000 vehicles due to roof problem: Here's which models are affected What cookies with peanuts did you remember? According to a recall statement released Tuesday, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Food, Standards and Product Safety Division (DCP) reported that one death has been reported so far in connection with the recalled cookies. According to DCP, Baxendale allegedly ate the cookies at a social function in Connecticut, and the mislabeled products – Florentine cookies with a best-by date of January 5, 2024 – were made at a bakery in Islip, New York. According to the statement, the cookies contain peanuts and the manufacturer has not disclosed this ingredient to Stew Leonard's. Adeyemi said, “Orla was very careful and cautious about what she ate and always checked the ingredients thoroughly on all packaging.” Additionally, the attorney said, when she saw the cookies and began having an anaphylactic reaction, an Epi pen was used, but “due to the severity of her allergies, it was not effective.” Latest product recalls;Robitussin cough syrup recalled nationwide due to microbial contamination 500 affected packages “This is a sad day for us. We learned that a customer was suffering from a peanut allergy who purchased a cookie here,” Stu Leonard Jr., president of the supermarket chain, said in a video statement posted on its website. Stew Leonard's Jr. said the company purchased the now-recalled holiday cookies from an outside supplier and that Stew Leonard's sold about 500 affected packages during the holidays. 'Unfortunately, the supplier changed the recipe and switched from soy nuts to peanuts and our company's Chief Safety Officer was never informed. We take labeling very seriously, especially when it comes to peanuts.” 'We are in compliance' USA Today, in a statement released Thursday, Walker G., an attorney for Cookies United. Flannery III called the woman's death tragic and expressed his condolences to the family of “this Stew Leonard's customer.” The statement continues, “Stew Leonard's claimed in a prior press release that 'the cookies contained peanuts,' an ingredient not disclosed by the manufacturer to Stew Leonard's.” “Unfortunately, given the tragedy of these circumstances, we need to point out that Stew Leonard's was informed by Cookies United in July 2023 that this product now contains peanuts and all products shipped to them will be labeled accordingly. This product is sold under the Stew Leonard's brand and repackaged at their facilities. The false label was created and applied by Stew Leonard's to their product.” The statement said Cookies United is cooperating with the New York State Department of Agriculture and has been informed that “we are complying with all applicable rules and regulations related to this product.” Baxendale is known for his 'peculiar character and boundless love' Baxendale is described in her obituary as a bright soul and woman of many talents, whose “charisma and vibrant spirit came to life through her work” with the Alvin Ailey School, Step on Broadway, Club Pilates and others. According to the obituary, she was known for her “quirky character and immense love for those around her… She was an excellent ballerina, contemporary and Irish step dancer.” “Each endeavor he undertook became a testament to his dedication and passion, which left a lasting impact on the lives of many people.” Natalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

The province says it would stunt job growth and cost billions of dollars. Saskatchewan will not comply with federal clean electricity regulations, no matter the cost. On Tuesday, the Saskatchewan Economic Impact Assessment Tribunal said the transition to a ‘net-zero’ power grid would ruin the local economy. It would stunt job growth and cost billions of dollars if implemented, claimed the Tribunal. The regulations would also worsen affordability concerns in the province. According to the federal government, the regulations would shift provincial power grids to ‘net-zero’ by 2035 without breaking the bank. A spokesperson for Environment and Climate Change Canada [alleged](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/clean-electricity-regulations-1.7246223) an “underlying ideological agenda” was afoot to garner sympathies in a political fight with the federal government, but the facts on the ground suggest otherwise.

We believe the… [pic.twitter.com/WHOpMNHTuN] [May 17, 2023] Tribunal chair Michael Milani said Saskatchewan's economic growth would suffer under the radical regulations. Through the next decade, it would plummet at least $7.1 billion if implemented. Milani estimated 4,200 fewer jobs due to rising electricity costs. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault hammered the tribunal for reaching “incorrect conclusions” in its report. “The results of this report are wildly out of sync with all the benefits we know come with building out a cleaner grid. Saskatchewan is ideally situated to be a leader in these economic opportunities,” he said in a statement to CBC News. Saskatchewan [announced](https://www.rebelnews.com/saskatchewan_to_invoke_autonomy_legislation_against_net-zero_power_grid_transition) last November it would invoke Bill 88, the Saskatchewan First Act, to establish the five-person tribunal. It includes former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon, former SaskEnergy CEO Kenneth From, agriculture researcher Stuart Smyth and oilsands worker Estella Peterson. Provincial autonomy advocates can rejoice after Saskatchewan passed Bill 88, The Saskatchewan First Act, Thursday morning to reiterate areas of provincial jurisdiction, particularly resource development.— Rebel News Canada (@RebelNews_CA) MORE: [https://t.co/lbSvm1NKlz] [pic.twitter.com/tX9u9L4iLp] [March 17, 2023] The tribunal's mandate was to assess the costs of federal overreach into resource development and electricity generation. At the time, Justice Minister Bronwyn Eyre condemned the draft regulations as “constitutional overreach.” “We cannot participate in federal economic harm to our province,” Eyre said Tuesday morning. Minister Guilbeault’s office claimed otherwise. The tribunal determined that by 2035, residential ratepayers would pay $241 more in electricity costs under the draft regulations. Similarly, commercial ratepayers and small industrial ratepayers would pay $888 and $1,429 more, respectively. Milani attributes those costs to the technology required not being readily available by the deadline. Saskatchewan has joined Alberta in refuting Ottawa's incoming clean electricity standards. They remain under development as Canada continues its fight against climate change.— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) MORE: [https://t.co/1CxSdu9X47] [pic.twitter.com/z92Aj0Y03O] [May 12, 2023] “There are a lot of trickle-down impacts from these federal policies that have not been economically canvassed or plumbed or completely analyzed or quantified,” Minister Eyre furthered. “Businesses have to want to make these changes,” Milani added, noting ongoing investor uncertainty. However, the feds claim Saskatchewan's report considers outdated regulations. Ottawa reportedly changed the draft in February, according to the Trudeau government. “This report is hard to take seriously,” Guilbeault's office said in a statement. The report fails to acknowledge the “significant additional flexibilities that we proposed and have been consulting on since earlier this year,” said a spokesperson from Environment Canada. That consultation remains ongoing, they conclude. Danielle Smith slams Ottawa's proposed electricity regulations as \"disastrously uninformed.\" Smith says they risk leaving people \"shivering in the darkness in the dead of winter.\"— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) [https://t.co/RPFfbxm6px] [pic.twitter.com/cnksmzoHgD] [September 28, 2023] Dustin Duncan, the minister responsible for Saskatchewan’s electricity utility, previously [said](https://www.rebelnews.com/saskatchewan_says_a_net-zero_power_grid_for_the_province_would_cost_taxpayers_40_billion) the regulations would cost provinces $40 billion. Other federal policies on the environment, including the two carbon taxes, emission caps and methane initiatives would cost the province $111 billion by 2035. The statement from Guilbeault's office contends the $40 billion figure is being misrepresented. “[It] ignores the millions of dollars the federal government has already invested to upgrade Saskatchewan's grids,” the statement declared.

The #1 shot a crucial birdie putt on 7th Hole and excitedly yelled, “What was that?” Yes, just like you, the commentators were also surprised and said, “Scheffler is showing some emotion.” Scheffler is always rather calm on the course and very rarely lets his “psychotic” side out. As it happened, Kyle Porter, a renowned golf media personality, said, “Tom Kim looks (and should be) scared of Scottie.” Nevertheless, it’s still too soon to say that there is any bitterness in their friendship. However, later Tom Kim did something that even commentators found “disrespectful.” NUCLR GOLF shared a post on X revealing Tom Kim and Sungjae Im vacated the 8th hole to walk 60 yards away to the 9th tee box before Scottie Scheffler finished putting out. Talking about it, Paul McGinley said, “That’s bordering on bad behavior. That’s disrespectful in my opinion.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Witnessing this behavior, vice captains Kevin Kisner and Camilo Villegas walked up to Kim and Sungjae Im.
