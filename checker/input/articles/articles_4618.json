This funding gives prospective organizations and small landowners support to implement regenerative practices such as agroforestry, native reforestation and soil health improvements. Grantees can also employ practices that reduce carbon emissions and promote carbon sequestration and storage. Eligible entities include private landowners and lessees, or those with documented access and rights to land management, community organizations, hui, networks and hubs, schools and businesses.\n“This is an opportunity to expand on the positive impacts that landowners and stewards have already created,” said Leah Laramee, Climate Commission Coordinator. “The more support we can provide around practical solutions to climate-related events, the better the outcomes for lands across the state.”\nThe previous cycle awarded funding to 10 grantees from Hawaiʻi County, Molokaʻi and Oʻahu, including organizations engaged in restoring native forests, improving soil health through composting, and transitioning fallow land to agroforestry systems. With this new round of funding, the program seeks to broaden its impact and involve an even more diverse range of participants.\nInterested landowners and organizations are encouraged to apply by visiting https://hands.ehawaii.gov/hands/opportunities/opportunity-details/25400. The deadline to apply is April 1, 2025.\n# # #\nRESOURCES\n(All images/video courtesy: DLNR)\nPhotographs – Soil sampling and native planting (September 2024 and February 2025): https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/6ku9c7djjfwgvyej189v2/AATGtERw8iLQfc4_NCDMGDc?rlkey=gxw0kj1qbyo94yymdpth5a6iq&st=on2uven8&dl=0\nFor more information, contact Emilie Perry, at: [[email protected]](https://governor.hawaii.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6e2b030702070b403e0b1c1c17402d01001a1c0f0d1a011c2e060f190f070740090118).\nMedia Contact:\nRyan Aguilar\nCommunications Specialist\nHawaiʻi Dept. of Land and Natural Resources\n808-587-0396",

    "text": "Woman claims she was left alone in UAB Medicine doctor’s office after it closed\nBy Jillian Kay\nClick here for updates on this story\nHUNTSVILLE, Alabama (\nWWAY) — We’ve all had long wait times at the doctor’s office at one point or another. But for one Huntsville woman, she claims her visit to UAB Medicine on Tuesday took much longer than expected.\nYaraliz Pagan describes the terrifying moments when she and her daughter were allegedly locked inside their doctor’s office.\nShe already does not enjoy going to the doctor, and she says this visit only elevated her fears.\n“There was still a green button that says there’s still a patient in there,” Pagan said. “How do you leave and have the green button and not see there’s someone there?”\nLucky for Pagan, she caught it all on camera and shared videos showing the moments she and her daughter realized they were locked inside the facility and left in their patient room.\nPagan says she booked her appointment late that day and went in as scheduled at 4:20 p.m.\nShe says the doctor saw her at 5 p.m., and they talked for a bit and she claims the doctor told her she’d be right back.\nHowever, an hour and a half later, around 6:30 p.m. Pagan and her daughter stepped outside their room to see what was going on and they couldn’t believe what they saw.\n“Empty,” Pagan said. “Never went nobody at least to check if anybody’s in the rooms, at least common sense please. Have someone check the rooms.”\nPagan says her daughter’s car was the only one in the lot. The front desk had a closed sign posted up and she claims no one came to check the room to see if they were still inside.\nWe reached out to UAB Medicine and asked what their lock-up protocol typically looks like. We even asked if they could show us how that process works.\nTheir spokesperson says they could not answer our questions due to patient privacy laws. However, they did say their doors lock from the outside, so anyone inside after hours can still get out freely.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
