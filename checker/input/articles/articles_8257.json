    "text": "2025.03. 06\n本文字数：2331，阅读时长大约4分钟\n作者 | 第一财经 张慧敏\n机构数据显示，截至今年2月，深圳新房去化周期从去年5月高峰的26个月，降至7个月。短短半年时间，深圳新房市场就从“去化呈压”转变为“库存紧张”的状态，而这也引发市场对于深圳新房市场价格上涨的担忧。\n那么，深圳新房市场为何在短时间内就经历了巨大的转变，深圳新房价格又是否会在近期大幅上涨？\n去化周期降至7个月\n自去年9.29后，深圳新房快速去化，库存量快速减少。根据房地产中介机构乐有家统计的数据，截至今年2月底，深圳一手预售住宅库存量为30385套，去化周期从去年5月高峰的26个月，降至7个月。\n从各区库存套数来看，新房库存量主要集中在龙岗、宝安、龙华，库存量均超5000套，其次为坪山、光明，库存量分别为4330、3237套，中心区的南山库存量为1911套，福田、罗湖分别为431套、778套，库存紧缺。\n通常情况下，一个城市的新房去化周期超过18个月，则被业内视为严重供大于求，市场面临调整压力；去化周期为12-18个月时，被认为是库存偏高；6-10个月左右，被视为健康的理想状态；低于6个月，则是库存紧张的表现，此时房价易上涨，需加快供地或增加新房供应。\n短短半年不到的时间，深圳新房去化周期即从超过18个月的去化承压状态迅速降至7个月的健康状态，甚至接近6个月以下的库存告急状态，无不让人产生房价上涨的担忧。\n“去年四季度新房市场成交量冲得太猛，好的项目都卖完了，剩下很多不好的劣质库存，可以说是阶段性断货，结构性断货。”深圳一房企销售人士对第一财经表示，当前深圳新房库存短缺的原因，主要与过去两年深圳新房市场去化速度太慢，土地公开拍卖的规模速降，在建工程缓建，旧改项目也停滞等因素有关。\n经历了楼市去化的漫长疲软期，2024年9月末，在限购政策放松、首付比例下降、豪宅税取消等因素影响下，深圳房地产市场去化速度明显加快，乐有家统计的数据显示，2024年四季度，深圳新房网签量共2.5万套，一个季度的网签量超过2024年全年网签量的一半。\n今年以来，尽管因为春节假期，新房网签量有所回落，但整体来看依旧高于2024年同期。过去的2月，深圳新房网签量为2484套，同比增长141%。上述房企销售人士认为，三月小阳春，深圳新房成交量肯定会继续走高，并且高于去年3的成交量。\n新房去化突然放量的背后，是近年来深圳土地供应规模大降的事实。\n公开数据显示，2024年，深圳成功出让的涉宅用地仅6宗，总建面约89万平方米；2023年为14宗，129万平方米，值得注意的是，2020年～2022年，深圳成功出让的涉宅用地通常都在30～40宗左右。近年来，深圳公开出让的涉宅地块，通常会在拿地半年或者一年后开盘，2024年公开出让的涉宅地块减少，将直接影响2025年的新房供应。\n城市更新领域，此前，有深圳本地房企人士对第一财经表示，因为新房销售端不景气，有的开发商考虑到后期的销售压力，会有意放缓城市更新项目入市的节奏，深圳即有项目尽管已经完成前期土地的整理，但开发商并不会进行开工建设。\n另外，根据深圳市城市更新协会统计的数据，2024年，深圳城市更新项目获得实施主体确认的有25个，较去年的47个减少了47%。在业内看来，这会影响未来一两年的新房供应。\n需求端，新房突然放量，而供给端，深圳面临过去两年的土地供应放缓，从而造成了当前深圳新房库存短缺的局面。\n今年1月份，深圳第首宗涉宅用地出让，这宗龙岗区龙城街道的涉宅用地经过近250轮竞价，最终由中海集团以30.65亿元竞得，溢价率高达70.4%。彼时，有业内观点认为，该地块竞争如此火热，与深圳新房市场2024年四季度成交量大涨，企业积极补仓有关。\n库存告急将在3月缓解\n新房库存告急，市场供不应求之下，是否会导致深圳新房价格的快速上涨？上述房地产营销人士对第一财经表示，目前来看还不会，因为价格上涨的速度一般滞后于成交量的上涨，通常情况下，新房价格普遍上涨的趋势，要在成交量连续半年上涨后才会显现。\n对于统计局公布的数据中，深圳新房价格指数已经连续环比上涨四个月的原因，该人士表示，\n从市场情况来看，应该是结构性上涨，即房价较高区域的新房项目成交占比提高，从而拉升了整个市场的房价指数。另外，因为深圳楼市的规模本身就比较小，只有北京、上海的三分之一，广州一半，因此只要市场成交量明显增长，市场行情就很容易被拉起来。\n整体来看，深圳房价处于稳定状态，以有“楼市晴雨表”之称的二手房价格为例，从2024年的10月开始，深圳二手房成交均价就已经回升到6万元/平方米以上，且都在6.35万元/平方米左右浮动。\n对于深圳新房市场库存告急的未来发展趋势，乐有家研究中心认为，“随着3月份后多个新房项目推出及加推等，深圳新房库存告急问题也会进一步缓解。”\n根据深圳市住建局公布的数据，截至2025年1月23日，深圳市2025年第一季度计划入市的商品住宅项目共16个，商品住宅6130套。根据深圳中原研究中心统计的最新数据，今年3月，深圳计划入市的潜在项目包括远洋观山海家园、深铁珑境二期、鸿荣源观城、金地环湾城等11个住宅项目，这些项目分布在中心区福田、南山，以及外围的宝安、龙华、龙岗、坪山多个区。\n招拍挂市场上，深圳市近期也积极推地，例如，3月4日的一场地块招商推介会中，深圳推出了多块涉宅用地，其中宝中西组团南街坊DY-01地块，因为是深圳地标“欢乐港湾”西岸片区近年来最靠近海岸线的涉宅用地，引发大量关注。值得一提的是，与近年深圳推出的“压箱底”靓地类似，该地块是由多宗商业用地调整规划后整合而成。\n另外，近期深圳的旧改项目的进展也在加速。例如，纳入旧改专项规划已有十五年的皇岗村，终于在今年2月7日公示了主体工程的施工许可。皇岗村位于深圳市福田区的中心，紧邻会展中心，靠近多条地铁线，算得上是深圳市中心的黄金地段，据第一财经了解，该项目将在今年4季度入市。\n微信编辑 | 七三",

    "text": "Venezuela’s opposition on Thursday warned of a potential mass exodus of migrants if President Nicolas Maduro remains in power following his contested reelection, with the US calling on the strongman not to arrest protest leaders. Election authorities have declared Maduro the winner of the July 28 vote despite not releasing detailed results. The opposition, which claims to have won in a landslide, has cried foul. The official results declaring Maduro the winner sparked protests last week which left at least 24 people dead, according to rights groups. “If Maduro chooses to stay by force, the only thing we will see is a wave of migration like never before: three, four, five million Venezuelans in a very short span of time,” opposition leader Maria Corina Machado — who was barred from running in the election — said in a video conference with Mexican news outlets. According to the United Nations, more than seven million Venezuelans have fled the country of 30 million since Maduro came to power in 2013, mostly for other Latin American countries and the United States. Maduro has overseen an unprecedented economic crisis, including an 80 percent drop in the once-wealthy oil-rich country’s GDP, amid domestic economic mismanagement and international sanctions. Washington has spearheaded sanctions against the Maduro regime and on Thursday threatened that further measures would be taken if Maduro were to arrest opposition leaders Machado or Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, a veteran retired diplomat who stood as a candidate after agreeing at the last minute to replace his barred colleague. “I think that would be a step that could mobilize the international community even more, even those that might be somewhat sympathetic and don’t want to rattle things too much in Venezuela,” Francisco Mora, the US ambassador to the Organization of American States, said at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. Machado — who says she fears for her life — and Gonzalez Urrutia have been in hiding for more than a week. On Thursday, Machado urged Maduro’s left-wing ally, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to use his influence to help broker a resolution to Venezuela’s political crisis. “Mexico has great power because it has a direct channel with the (Maduro) regime,” she said. – ‘International hysteria’ – The public prosecutor’s office has opened a criminal probe against the two opposition leaders for “usurpation of functions, diffusion of false information, incitement to disobedience of the laws, incitement to insurrection” and “criminal association.” Citing his fear that he would be “jeopardizing” his freedom if he did so, Gonzalez Urrutia on Wednesday defied a Supreme Court summons over the disputed results. The court summoned all presidential candidates, including Maduro, and other opposition politicians, some of whom did attend. Maduro is due to appear before the court on Friday. Critics say the court, and the electoral authority, are unfailingly loyal to Maduro, who wants the body to simply “validate” his victory. The National Electoral Council (CNE) ratified Maduro’s victory with 52 percent of votes, but did not publish detailed results and even claimed to have been hacked. The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia with two-thirds of votes. The government claims those are forged. The opposition and several observers accuse the CNE of inventing the hack at the government’s behest to avoid publishing the real results. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez on Thursday hit out at the international community and critics on social media for “an international hysteria around the (election) minutes, they could even make a Netflix series.” She repeated the government’s claim that the CNE had been the victim of “a massive cyberattack,” adding that “the social media dictatorship is seeking to replace the popular will of governments elected by their citizens.” Jennie Lincoln, head of the Carter Center delegation that was invited to monitor the Venezuelan election, told AFP that that US-based organization had “no evidence” of a cyberattack. In addition to the protester deaths, Maduro announced the death of two police officers and the arrest of more than 2,200 people.",

    "title": "#54 Nagasaki defiende su decisión de no invitar a Israel al memorial conmemorativo de la bomba atómica (EN)",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#1](c1#c-1) Invitar a EEUU es de guasa, ¿han pedido perdón en algún momento después de la burrada que hicieron?\n[#21](c21#c-21) Yo diría que por decencia moral. Nagasaki era totalmente innecesario. Sólo fue una prueba de campo y una \"advertencia\" a los vecinos del Norte (curiosamente aliados en aquellas fechas) sobre la inviolabilidad de Hokkaido. Que los japoneses eran más malos que la tiña, pero cargarse 100000 para dar una advertencia...\n[#24](c24#c-24) Ya se habían cargado otros tantos en los bombardeos de tokio.\nhttps://historia.nationalgeographic.com.es/a/el-bombardeo-de-tokio-uno-de-los-mas-mortiferos-de-la-historia_15135\nSolo cambia el medio utilizado.\n[#35](c35#c-35) Eso no puede ser cierto, ya que es un hecho que ha sucedido. No puedes decir que algo que ha pasado no tiene ninguna razón para pasar.\n[#42](c42#c-42) Yo no tengo una opinión sobre esos hechos. Hace mucho tiempo y la moral ha cambiado mucho desde entonces. Además, la segunda guerra mundial es un contexto histórico muy específico.\nObviamente, yo hoy no aprobaría moralmente el lanzamiento de bombas atómicas sobre nadie.\n[#32](c32#c-32) Ya estaban vencidos. Lanzaron las bombas para enseñar al mundo que las tenían. Miles de muertos para que los EEUU mostrasen lo grande que la tenían.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Bueno, podríamos decir que los propios japoneses no fueron de lo más delicado con sus víctimas en Manchuria. Aquí no se libra nadie.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Al igual que los japoneses son invitados al monumento al Arizona desde hace décadas. De eso se trata cuando se habla de cerrar heridas y pasar página. Entre otras cosas porque las generaciones de entonces no son las de ahora. La mayoría de ceremonias conjuntas datan de los '60 y USA y japón son aliados hace mucho.\nAsí que lo que me parece de guasa es tu comentario que está obviando 60 años de historia por un poco de karma fácil.\n[#39](c39#c-39) Criticar que EEUU atacase con bombas atómicas a población civil no es por karma, es por estar en contra de crímenes de guerra\n[#1](c1#c-1) \"EE.UU., el Reino Unido y otros países dicen que enviarán funcionarios de bajo nivel\"\nSi fuera yo, ni les dejaba entrar\n[#1](c1#c-1) Lo de que tengan que \"defender\" una decisión tan digna, humana y de sentido común como es no blanquear a regímenes fascistas y genocidas es lo más alucinante e indignante del tema.\nMe parece precioso el gesto y puede parecer vacío, pero a fin de cuestas nuestra realidad se basa en gestos vacíos sin grandes aspavientos y grandes acciones que nos definen como buenas o malas personas.\nAsí que me parece precioso que no se permita a unas personas que están cometiendo un genocidio ahora mismo a que asistan a los actos de recordatorio de un crimen de guerra horrendo, como fueron el lanzamiento de dos bombas atómicos sobre unas ciudades por parte de USA.\nY si USA se cree que su ausencia hace de menos a esta conmemoración está muy equivocada, son ellos los que se convierten en menos por no asistir...\nY lo mismo digo a Francia (que ya está tirada por el suelo por no expulsar a Israel de los juegos) o Reino Unido...\nHan quedado a la altura de lo que son ahora mismo...\nLa nada más terrible.\n[#45](c45#c-45) lo único interesante de no estar invitados sería que fuera por genocidas ... que no estén invitados para que no haya movidas con manifestantes, pues me parece una tontería. No es que no estén invitados a los juegos olímpicos, es una conmemoración sin más.\nJapón ha venido sosteniendo el \"derecho a defenderse\" a israel........... así que no te emociones. Y no creo que tenga que recordar que Japón es una nación genocida que celebra los crímenes de guerra y elimina pruebas de lo sucedido en Korea, China etc ....\nThe British embassy said leaving out Israel created “an unfortunate and misleading equivalency with Russia and Belarus — the only other countries not invited to this year’s ceremony”\nDesde luego que es una desafortunada equivalencia. Rusia no esta haciendo un genocidio especialmente enfocado a niños.\nIsrael’s exclusion had “politicized” the event.\nNo reventaran, porque claro, una guerra, una bomba nuclear de un estado enemigo y una reunion por ese evento con politicos de todos los paises no es politizar algo. Hijos de puta no reventaran.\nOtro circo más para proyectar imagen a nivel internacional, pero ya está todo más que hablado de antes. Estas cosas a mi me parecen prácticamente prensa rosa venida a mas.\nAhora mismo apoyar abiertamente el genocidio israelí no beneficiaria a Japón, invitando a EEUU ya han expresado su postura diplomática y han cumplido con sus obligaciones en cuanto a imagen internacional.\nPor otro lado EEUU también debe mantener su imagen de apoyo incondicional a Israel.\nLos tratos comerciales, que es lo que manda, no se van a ver afectados por esto.\nJapón se mantiene como aliado incondicional de EEUU igual que lleva siendo los últimos 80 años.\nYa no es por una cuestión numérica. Israel no puede ser invitada a nada, más que a detener el aberrante genocidio contra el pueblo palestino.\nEEUU, UK y otros países demostrando que hay víctimas civiles que valen y otra que no. Y todo para apoyar a un estado genocida, en pleno genocidio de civiles inocentes.\nPor eso nunca ha pasado nada con los más de 160 millones de muertos en la India, de las decenas de miles en Iraq y tantos otros más en tantos otros países.\nPorque se las sudan.\nPor cierto, en RU hay un nuevo PM... otra prueba más que los laboristas actuales (como los de blair) son la misma mierda que los conservadores.",
