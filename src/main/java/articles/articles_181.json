    "text": "Higher employee pay will be key to running Wake schools smoothly, superintendent says Shortages of teachers, infrastructure and technology workers will hamper schools’ ability to provide the best education, facilities and tools to children, Wake County Public School System Superintendent Robert Taylor said Thursday. Pay increases will help, he said, but a full reversal of the trends could take years and a much bigger effort than incremental raises. Taylor spoke Thursday afternoon to a League of Women Voters of Wake County gathering. He spoke briefly on a number of topics but stressed that his end goal of improving education for all students relies on being able to recruit and retain quality faculty and staff. “I’ve heard people also comment that more money doesn't mean better education,” Taylor said. “Well, I would agree to that. I would agree to that. But also recognize that there are some things that you can't do without the right compensation.” Teachers will take other jobs, he said. Buildings will wither. Technology won’t work. Taylor is proposing a $58.3 million increase in county funding for the school system’s budget next year. Most of the system’s budget will come from the state next year, something Taylor has no control over. Taylor’s budget would allow the district to keep more than 100 employees who are currently funded using federal dollars that will run out next year. It doesn’t include across-the-board raises, unlike the two most recent budgets adopted by the school board. School board members are pushing for pay increases and eyeing [what current operations can be cut](/story/that-s-a-tough-choice-wake-school-board-considers-cuts-adjustments-to-fund-raises/21383197/) to make room for them. The county provides thousands of dollars to teachers every year as a supplement to their base pay from the state. Increases to that supplement the past two years have provided a hundred to a few hundred more dollars each time. Taylor’s talk Thursday was focused on what he’s learned in his first six months on the job and after holding meetings in the community. He’s heard people say positive things about the schools and teachers but also hears an appetite for improvement, “A lot of that starts with compensation,” he said. That’s a problem as the cost of living balloons, he said. “It is extremely difficult for a teacher to afford to live in Wake County.” Wake County is short more than 300 bus drivers and more than 200 teachers, although that’s down from being short more than 300 teachers most of last school year. Wake isn’t alone in its hiring challenges. Both urban and rural areas have been struggling. Statewide, more than 6,000 teaching positions were either not filled or were filled by someone who wasn’t a qualified teacher at the beginning of the school year, according to new state data. That was out of the 94,000 traditional public school teaching positions. [Teacher turnover reached 11.5%](/story/nc-teacher-turnover-hits-highest-mark-in-decades-new-report-shows-changes-in-who-is-leading-classrooms/21361469/) from March 2022 to March 2023, its highest point since at least 2001, according to a WRAL analysis of state teaching reports. Audience members expressed concern for more public dollars going to private school vouchers while the state still had a teacher shortage. They also asked about how to press the issue forward. Taylor said most of the community doesn’t have school-age children but the impact of education is far-and-wide, including when attracting business that want to find local talent. “People need to understand that we have a teacher shortage in this state,” he said. “And it is across the nation. We have fewer people, children or students going into education. We have more teachers getting out of education.” Teachers might quit because of money — and stress — but a small raise won’t prevent the shortage from growing, he said. The profession needs major changes that will take time to negotiate, approve and implement. Finally seeing improvements could take seven to 10 years, he said, in part because newly enticed teaching recruits may need four years of college before they can become a teacher. “We do have a teacher shortage, and it’s not going to change until we start making these kinds of choices,” he said.

    "title": "Virgin Hotels Las Vegas employees continue strike for higher wages on Thanksgiving Day",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS (KSNV) — As people around the country and Vegas Valley celebrate Thanksgiving with their loved ones, employees of one local casino spend their day outside protesting. Thursday marked fifteen days since employees of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas went on strike, demanding better wages. \"With as small the casino as this is compared to the other casinos around town, I didn't think it would last that long,\" said Debora Wilby, an usher at Virgin who is on strike. As some came to enjoy Thanksgiving at the property, strikers, encouraged them to take their business elsewhere. \"I would much rather be home and relaxing, getting ready to eat with family, as opposed to being out here,\" said Timothy McKeever, a room service striker who says the strike is worth it. \"It's a shame that we're having to do this.\" \"The pay increase is necessary. As a matter of fact, today's Thanksgiving, I'm missing it with my family, and when I'm done here, I'll be going to my second job that's required,\" said Timothy Mara, a line cook for the casino. The strikers say they will be outside the property with their signs and blow horns as long as it takes. \"They're not agreeing to the terms of our contract. Every other property in Vegas has agreed to the same terms, which means that if the contract expires next time, except for renewal, will already be years behind every other property,\" said McKeever. Two weeks ago Virgin Hotels said in a statement that they provided financial information to the union showing that the union's proposal was not \"economically sustainable for the property.\" \"That's corporate greed. That is- that is big companies wanting to hold on tight all the money they have,\" said Wilby. Virgin Hotels says that some of the temporary workers they hired are former Culinary members who had been laid off because of properties closing or because of union contracts that led to some job cuts. \"That's really discouraging. You know, the company sent out a communication saying that they would do just that, that, you know if we came out and struck, that there's a potential that we could be replaced,\" said McKeever. \"But I'm hoping that they're going to have a change of heart.\" If these strikes continue to go on for long, some say it'll be a major strain on their families. \"If this goes on for a while, I might take up another job to supplement the hours,\" said Mara. \"But we are out here, we are getting paid. I also can pick up more hours at my second job.\" Strikers say it's challenging living off the pay you get while on strike. \"We get paid a maximum of $500 a week, which isn't comparable to what I was making,\" said McKeever. \"But it's - hopefully it doesn't go on too long.\" Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said in a statement in part: \"Despite Virgin Hotels Las Vegas agreeing to many of the Culinary Union’s demands and showing flexibility on key issues, the Culinary Union has not seriously countered any of our economic proposals or brought our latest offer to their members for a formal vote. We remain focused on reaching a reasonable agreement that secures a brighter future for all of our 1,710 team members and their families.\"",

    "title": "Descanso Gardens Will Unveil New Railroad Attraction, Blending Nature and Miniature Trains – Pasadena Weekendr",
    "text": "The event runs from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and is free with garden admission at 1418 Descanso Drive. The Descanso Railroad, located just past the entrance, features model trains traversing intricate landscapes and depots constructed from natural materials, including flora sourced directly from the gardens. Jennifer Errico, director of communications at Descanso Gardens, explained the inspiration behind the project. “The Ride-on train has always been a really popular amenity here at the Gardens,” he said. “About two years ago we saw some trains in another garden. It’s a company called Applied Imagination, and they build train stations and train areas from natural materials.” The new attraction incorporates elements of Descanso’s natural surroundings, including wood from oak trees felled during last year’s storms, seamlessly integrating the railroad into the garden’s ecosystem. Visitors can embark on journeys aboard an electric train from a newly constructed station, adding an interactive dimension to their garden exploration experience. The railroad’s design features tracks at varying heights, allowing trains to run both above visitors and at ground level for children to enjoy. “These train stations are built from natural materials, so if you look at them, you’ll see acorns in the chimneys and mahogany seed pods and all different barks,” Errico said. The initial exhibition will showcase famous train stations from across the United States, with plans to rotate themes every six months. Some of these intricate stations take thousands of hours to build. To enhance the grand opening festivities, the musical group True Blue will perform live bluegrass in the Oak Grove from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Descanso Railroad is part of a broader master plan approved in 2020, which involved significant community input and support. Errico noted the overwhelming positive response saying he has not heard one negative thing about construction. “In fact, we have a really large, wonderful group of volunteers here that help us in the hundreds,” he said. Looking ahead, Descanso Gardens has plans for further expansion, including a lake rehabilitation project and the construction of a children’s garden, with construction beginning by year-end and expected to open in two years. Errico said these future developments will feature educational elements focused on water, a sensory garden, and other nature-themed attractions, further enhancing the garden’s offerings for visitors of all ages. Train ride tickets will be available for purchase during the grand opening, though availability is limited. Members of Descanso Gardens will have early access to the attraction from July 5 to 12.

    "text": "Costruiamo un futuro migliore dove vivere insieme. Con questo slogan Cartiere Carrara, tra le principali aziende del settore produzione della carta per uso igienico e domestico, ha presentato ieri nella propria sede istituzionale a Capannori, il bilancio di sostenibilità 2023. Un documento che rappresenta un passo fondamentale nel percorso avviato dall’impresa nel 2023, in occasione del 150° anniversario dalla fondazione. Tutto ciò coniugato ad un \"Manifesto della sostenibilità\", declinato come un ponte verso il futuro.\nUn domani che è già oggi, poiché le normative del Green Deal dell’Unione Europea, prevedono come obbligatorio questo strumento sulla sostenibilità dal 2025, (le società quotate dal 2024). Ora non sarà più su base volontaria, ma sul binario di regole omogenee derivanti dalle direttive comunitarie e chi sarà più virtuoso avrà anche vantaggi finanziari.\nErano presenti il Cavaliere del Lavoro Massimo Carrara, presidente del gruppo; Matteo Carrara, membro del board; l’amministratore delegato, Gaetano Ievolella; Francesco Ferrara, Pwc Italia ESG leader; Cristiano Dutto, direttore sostenibilità e qualità di cartiere Carrara spa; la dottoressa Alessandra Aonzo di Pwc, l’assessore comunale Claudia Berti, oltre a stakeholder, clienti e fornitori vari.\nIn anticipo rispetto agli obblighi stabiliti dalla normativa europea Csrd, la multinazionale rende note le proprie attività relative agli aspetti Esg, acronimo di ‘environmental social governance’ e le strategie per la sostenibilità e, soprattutto, come raggiungere determinati obiettivi. Il presidente Carrara ha anche illustrato il progetto piantagione, la carta che crea gli alberi, 15mila già piantati, ma con target di arrivare a 150mila. Poi, nella sala gremita dell’auditorium intitolato a Mario Carrara, sono stati diffusi i dati sullo stato di salute dell’impresa: fatturato 500 milioni, in linea con il 2022, raddoppiato invece l’Ebitda, indicatore finanziario che aiuta a comprendere la capacità di un’azienda di generare i flussi di cassa. E’ un parametro che ignora le spese per imposte, interessi, deprezzamenti e ammortamenti e consente agli analisti di concentrarsi specificatamente sulla performance operativa, misura la redditività aziendale. Il Gruppo ha generato un valore globale di 463 milioni, di cui il 2% è stato distribuito agli azionisti, l’8% è la quota parte che rimane in azienda.\nLa maggior parte, 83% è andata a stakeholder esterni, fornitori di beni e servizi il Bilancio di Sostenibilità testimonia come l’impegno di Cartiere Carrara abbia permesso di unire elevate performance ambientali, energetiche e sociali agli ottimi risultati economici del 2023. Guardando al futuro, Cartiere Carrara si impegna a: continuare nel percorso di riduzione del consumo dell’acqua. Proseguire nell’implementazione di pratiche sostenibili in tutte le fasi della produzione. Investire in ricerca e sviluppo per trovare soluzioni innovative che riducano ulteriormente l’impatto ambientale e ridurre la produzione dei rifiuti.\nRafforzare la collaborazione con tutti gli stakeholder per promuovere una economia circolare e sostenibile. Cartiere Carrara, inoltre, promuove la diffusione dell’etica e dell’integrità aziendale. Questi principi ispirano tutta la politica aziendale e sono racchiusi nel Codice Etico e nel modello di organizzazione, gestione e controllo. Soci, amministratori, dipendenti, si devono allineare.",

    "title": "Il titolo IGM Biosciences declassato dopo i dati di Fase 1b e il cambio strategico Da Investing.com",
    "text": "Venerdì, BMO Capital Markets ha rivisto la sua posizione sul titolo IGM Biosciences, declassandolo da Outperform a Market Perform. La società ha anche ridotto significativamente il target di prezzo per le azioni dell'azienda biotecnologica, fissandolo a $2,00, un forte calo rispetto al precedente obiettivo di $21,00. Il titolo, attualmente scambiato a $6,20 con una capitalizzazione di mercato di $369 milioni, è sceso di quasi il 44% nell'ultimo anno. Secondo l'analisi di InvestingPro , il titolo appare sottovalutato ai livelli attuali.\nIl declassamento segue il recente aggiornamento strategico di IGM Biosciences, che ha incluso la decisione di interrompere lo sviluppo di due dei suoi candidati farmaci, imvotamab e IGM-2644, per il trattamento delle malattie autoimmuni.\nSecondo BMO Capital Markets, i dati degli studi di Fase 1b di imvotamab, che era in fase di valutazione per l'artrite reumatoide e il lupus eritematoso sistemico, hanno dimostrato un'inadeguata deplezione delle cellule B, portando l'azienda a riconsiderare la sua pipeline di prodotti. I dati di InvestingPro rivelano che l'azienda sta bruciando rapidamente liquidità, con un EBITDA di -$224 milioni negli ultimi dodici mesi, sebbene mantenga un sano indice di liquidità corrente di 5,22.\nIl cambio strategico di IGM Biosciences rispetto a questi candidati farmaci era inaspettato, poiché l'approccio T cell engager (TCE) mirato a CD20 aveva una forte logica meccanicistica. La decisione dell'azienda sottolinea le sfide intrinseche e l'imprevedibilità associate alle terapie mediate dalle cellule T nei campi del cancro e delle malattie autoimmuni.\nL'azienda non ha fornito ulteriori dettagli sul potenziale impatto finanziario di questa svolta strategica o su eventuali piani futuri per i suoi asset rimanenti. La risposta del mercato al declassamento del rating da parte di BMO Capital Markets e alla conseguente riduzione del target di prezzo riflette l'incertezza che circonda il percorso futuro di IGM Biosciences dopo l'interruzione di candidati farmaci chiave.\nPer approfondimenti sulla salute finanziaria e le prospettive future di IGM Biosciences, gli investitori possono accedere ad analisi complete e oltre 10 ProTips aggiuntivi attraverso i dettagliati rapporti di ricerca di InvestingPro .\nIn altre notizie recenti, IGM Biosciences è stata sotto i riflettori in seguito a significativi cambiamenti strategici verso lo sviluppo di trattamenti per le malattie autoimmuni.\nI risultati finanziari del secondo trimestre dell'azienda hanno rivelato una perdita netta di $0,79 per azione, una deviazione rispetto al guadagno inizialmente previsto di $0,21 per azione. Tuttavia, H.C. Wainwright ha rivisto la sua proiezione di perdita netta per l'intero anno 2024 per IGM Biosciences a $2,31 per azione, un miglioramento rispetto alla perdita netta precedentemente stimata di $3,27 per azione.\nBMO Capital ha fissato un obiettivo di $21 per IGM Biosciences, con un rating Outperform, indicando una prospettiva positiva per il futuro dell'azienda. Questo rating è subordinato al continuo sviluppo clinico dell'azienda e alla riuscita differenziazione dei suoi candidati prodotti in un mercato competitivo.\nAnche RBC Capital Markets ha mantenuto il suo rating Outperform su IGM Biosciences, aumentando il target di prezzo a $20,00 dal precedente $17,00, riflettendo la fiducia nel cambio strategico dell'azienda verso il settore autoimmune. Tuttavia, JPMorgan ha declassato l'azienda da 'Neutral' a 'Underweight' e ha ridotto il suo target di prezzo a $9,00.\nCon un punteggio complessivo di Salute Finanziaria \"DEBOLE\" secondo InvestingPro , si consiglia agli investitori di monitorare attentamente i progressi di IGM Biosciences attraverso i suoi traguardi clinici e la posizione di cassa.\nQuesto articolo è stato generato e tradotto con il supporto dell'intelligenza artificiale e revisionato da un redattore.

    "title": "US appeals court panel hands Trump another loss in E. Jean Carroll case",
    "text": "US appeals court panel hands Trump another loss in E. Jean Carroll case\nA 2nd Circuit US Court of Appeals panel just rejected former President Donald Trump's latest attempt to delay his January defamation trial in New York.\nIn a Thursday filing from 2nd Circuit judges José A. Cabranes (a Clinton appointee), Denny Chin (an Obama appointee) and Maria Araújo Khan (a Biden appointee), Trump's motion to stay the appellate court's rejection of his immunity argument\nwas rejected. Effectively, this means that after the former president's lawyers failed to convince the court that Trump had absolute immunity from civil actions, they filed a last-ditch motion to ask the court to pause — or \"stay\" — that ruling from going into effect ahead of the January 16 trial. The former president's lawyers argued a 90-day stay was necessary while they considered their options for appeal.\n\"Trump had asked for the stay — and to delay the January trial — while he considered appealing to SCOTUS,\" tweeted Politico legal correspondent Kyle Cheney.\nPOLL:\nShould Trump be allowed to hold office again?\nWriter E. Jean Carroll claimed that before he was president, Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in a New York department store in the 1990s. In 2019, while Trump was president, he claimed that Carroll had fabricated the allegations and suggested she was motivated by money. Earlier this year, a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and ordered the 45th president of the United States to\npay his accuser $5 million.\nThe defamation trial for Trump's 2019 statements is scheduled for January 16 — one day after the Iowa Caucuses. The trial will mark the former president's second civil trial in New York in three months. Trump is currently in the midst of an ongoing civil fraud trial in which New York Attorney General Letitia James accused the ex-president and his real estate company of submitting falsified statements to state authorities meant to artificially inflate the value of his real estate portfolio.\nIn that case, Judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled that Trump committed widespread fraud, and stripped him of his ability to be an officer of any New York-based corporation. While an appeals court upheld Engoron's fraud ruling, it reversed his order taking away Trump's ability to do business in New York pending the final outcome of the trial.\nREAD MORE:\nUS appeals court strikes down Trump's immunity argument in E.
