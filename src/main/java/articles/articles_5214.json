    "title": "Givinostat Slows Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Decline | MedPage Today",
    "text": "Givinostat (Duvyzat) slowed physical decline as measured by stair climbing speed for a subset of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), according to the phase III trial that supported the drug's recent approval for this indication.\nWhile the boys still declined over 72 weeks on the oral drug, their times for a four-stair climb assessment slowed by a relative 14% less from baseline to week 72 compared with the placebo group (geometric least squares mean ratio 1.27 vs 1.48, between-group ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99, P =0.035), Eugenio Mercuri, MD, of the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome, and colleagues reported in Lancet Neurology .\nMean four-stair climb time change from baseline to 72 weeks was an added 1.25 seconds in the givinostat group compared with 3.03 seconds in the placebo group -- a 1.78 second smaller increase with the drug that the researchers called \"potentially meaningful to patients, because slower four-stair climb correlates with reduced participation in physical and social activities in daily life and predicts loss of stair-climbing ability and ambulatory capacity.\"\nGivinostat was associated with fewer items failed and a slower decline compared to placebo in a secondary endpoint, the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) scale, which measures functional motor abilities, though the differences did not reach significance.\n\"The observed benefits of givinostat in this study suggest new therapeutic avenues for treating patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy...\" wrote Janbernd Kirschner, MD, of the University of Freiburg, in Germany in an accompanying commentary . \"However, the extent to which givinostat can lead to clinically meaningful improvements with long-term use across a wider cohort of patients ... remains to be seen.\"\nDuchenne, an incurable muscular dystrophy that occurs mostly in boys, is characterized by a mutation that causes a lack of functional dystrophin and muscle damage. Givinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that works on pathogenic processes resulting from the dystrophin deficiency to reduce muscle degeneration.\nThe drug was approved in March by the FDA for all DMD patients ages 6 and older, a broad indication compared with what Kirschner called narrow entry criteria in the trial.\nThe international EPIDYS trial enrolled males ages 6 years and older with genetically confirmed DMD who were ambulatory at baseline: They had to be able to complete two 4-stair climb assessments with a mean of 8 seconds or less and have a time-to-rise of at least 3 seconds but less than 10 seconds. Only participants in a prespecified group with a baseline vastus lateralis fat fraction (VLFF) between 5% and 30% were evaluated for efficacy, while participants with VLFF outside these ranges were included as part of a larger cohort for safety analysis.\nVastus lateralis fat has been shown to correlate with loss of ambulation. The randomized group \"was intended to comprise patients who were not at risk of sudden, complete loss of ambulation but who, if receiving placebo, would show sufficient decline over the study duration in the function, strength, and fat fraction endpoints being tested,\" the researchers noted.\nFDA approval did not restrict use by ambulation or VLFF.\nThe trial also required that patients have received systemic corticosteroids for at least 6 months. DMD is often treated with corticosteroids to slow loss of muscle strength and function, albeit with side effects like weight gain and bone fragility. Patients stayed on their regimen. Randomization was stratified according to corticosteroid type and regimen. Kirschner called it important that the \"observed treatment effects occurred in addition to the benefits derived from a stable glucocorticoid regimen.\"\nA total of 179 boys (>90% white, mean age 9.8 years) were randomized to double-blind treatment with oral givinostat or equivalent placebo doses based on weight twice a day for 72 weeks.\nThe key secondary endpoints did not differ between groups after multiplicity adjustment, but were suggestive of benefits with givinostat:\nDecrease in NSAA total score from baseline over 72 weeks (least squares mean difference 1.91 [95% CI 0.295-3.533]) Cumulative loss-of-function (3.42 vs 5.56 items failed over 72 weeks, ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.41-0.93]) Change from baseline in time-to-rise (least squares mean difference between groups of –3.28 [95% CI –9.57 to 3.02]) The effect size in NSAA score also was deemed important by Kirschner, citing an analysis by the Collaborative Trajectory Analysis Project in which \"loss of 2.0 NSAA items predicted clinically meaningful disease progression, loss of ambulation in the functionally declining group, and loss of ability to rise from the floor in the younger, more stable group. Moreover, complete loss of function in one NSAA item, or deterioration in 1–2 items, is perceived as an important change by patients and parents.\"\nHe noted that lack of significance in change in time to rise was likely due to large interpatient variability.\nAdverse event rates were similar in the two groups, although treatment-related events were more frequent with givinostat. For nearly half of the givinostat group (48%), the dose was reduced, mostly due to side effects including reduction in platelet count and thrombocytopenia. The starting dose was also reduced after an interim safety review. Other common treatment-related side effects included diarrhea and abdominal pain. \"However, these are recognised adverse events of givinostat and can generally be managed by dose reduction or interruption,\" Kirschner wrote.\nLimitations included a substantial risk of unmasking due to dose reduction after adverse events and a sample size too small to evaluate every secondary endpoint. A proportion of patients also started the study on a lower dose of givinostat due to a protocol amendment to manage adverse effects.\nThe researchers were further limited by the exclusion of nonambulatory and female patients, an almost all white sample, and no participating centers in Asia or Africa.",

    "title": "I made one small change while traveling with my kids. It cost $150 but was worth every penny — and I wish I’d done it sooner.",
    "text": "- I travel regularly with my two kids, which requires a lot of stuff.\n- Until this month, I always brought our own car seats and Pack 'n Play crib.\n- This time, I rented car seats and a crib. I paid $150 extra but the change made travel much easier.\nMy husband and I\nstarted traveling with my first daughter when she was only 6 months old. We began with local road trips and later flew cross-country to Hawaii and Mexico.\nWe would always haul our car seat and Pack 'n Play alongside numerous suitcases and carry-on bags.\nIt was a lot, but I preferred having our own stuff.\nBut when my second daughter was born in 2023, it quickly became clear that this strategy no longer served us. We were massively outnumbered by bags to people.\nSo when it was time to take another family trip this past December, I ditched our car seats and Pack 'n Play. It was a game changer for us as parents.\nEven though renting seats costs extra, I'll never bring these items again.\nPreviously, I thought it would be easiest and safest to bring our own gear\nAs a nervous first-time parent, I initially shot down the idea of renting car seats.\nThe\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration says to replace a child's car seat anytime it is involved in a moderate to severe car crash. However, according to Safe Ride 4 Kids, there is no way to inspect a car seat after a crash to determine the severity of damage. The safest thing you can do is throw it away.\nThis made me anxious. What if someone rented a car with seats and got into a scuffle deemed minor, but damage occurred, I wondered.\nFor this reason, we always brought our own — plus, car seats are always free to check in with airlines so it seemed like a waste of money to rent them.\nWe purchased a second, lighter\n10-pound travel seat for travel for my toddler instead of her 30-pound Britax Boulevard seat that had already cost us $350.\nI also thought it was more reliable to bring our own Pack 'n Play after encountering hotels with heavily-used models in rough shape, and one instance where they were all in use by other guests.\nBut then we had a second baby and took our first trip as a family of four. We flew from Palm Springs, California, to Denver, Colorado, when my baby was two months old.\nStill in an infant seat, we brought her\nUppababy Mesa with its required base, a collective 20 pounds. We also had my toddler's travel car seat, a Pack 'n Play, three full-size suitcases, two diaper bags, two carry-on bags, and a travel stroller.\nI'm still not sure how we all made it from the curb to the check-in desk.\nI do, however, have vivid memories of schlepping it all off a car rental shuttle bus at the airport — thank you, sympathetic strangers who helped us — then across two lanes of traffic, into an elevator, and across the terminal while wrangling a toddler and infant. Tears were involved, and not just from my children.\nKnowing we had a family trip to Orlando six months later, we vowed to do things differently for our collective sanity.\nPacking lighter removed so much stress\nAs our Orlando trip neared, I couldn't stop thinking about all the stuff we had to bring.\nPerhaps more at ease as a second-time parent, I decided it was very unlikely a rental car agency would ever allow a crash to go undetected. I rebooked our rental to include one infant car seat and one toddler seat when we picked up the car for an extra $156.\nWe also left the Pack 'n Play behind. We'd previously been able to use Pack 'n Plays at hotels closer to home without an issue, on trips to Huntington Beach and Coronado, San Diego. And before we arrived in Orlando, I requested a Pack 'n Play at each of our two hotels ahead of time. Considering we were visiting the very family-friendly\nWalt Disney World area, I wasn't too worried about availability.\nWhen we landed in Orlando, our car rental agency had two seats waiting for us wrapped in plastic. While they felt cheaper and less sturdy than ours at home, they did the job.\nThere was no problem at each of our hotels with the Pack 'n Play either, and we brought our own sheet to make it more familiar for our baby.\nWhile we still had a lot to lug between suitcases, carry-ons, and a stroller, removing our heaviest, bulkiest baggage made a huge difference.\nIt was such a simple change, I can't believe we didn't do it sooner.\nBusiness Insider",

    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — This article originally appeared in the Idaho Press . Central District Health reminded students and their families Monday that free mental health resources will be going away after Dec. 31, 2024. The two-year pilot program has offered free counseling session for students, siblings, parents and guardians in the participating districts. Students and families in Ada County school districts — Boise, Kuna, and West Ada — will still be able to schedule mental health counseling sessions through March 31, 2025. “This is a confidential and free-to-families resource to help students and families get the mental well-being support they need in order to be successful in school and life,” Dana Menlove, BPA Health chief operating officer, said. The program, named the Student & Family Assistance Program (SFAP), has been providing mental health services through a partnership with Central District Health, BPA Health and the participating school districts. Nearly 1,000 counseling sessions had been held in the last two years, a Central District Health press release said. “Thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, we were able to offer this pilot program in the three public school districts in Ada County to address the needs of many families in the area to find free mental health support,” Connor Young, CDH health police analyst, said in the release. The funds received through this legislation were meant to address the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and originally planned to conclude in 2024. Though applications for alternative funding sources were made, additional funds could not be secured to allow the program to extend beyond the end of 2024, Young said. According to the Idaho-based BPA Health website , at least one in five adults in the U.S. lives with a metal illness, almost 50% of U.S. youth live with a mental illness and 69,000 Idahoans had suicidal thoughts in the last year. Through the Ada County school districts will lose the program come 2025, BPA health will still be offering the SFAP program to students and families in the “Twin Falls, Kimberly, Wendell and Nez Perce School Districts.” For Boise students and their families, CDH will continue to offer “affordable counseling services” at its Boise clinic and through telehealth, the release said.
