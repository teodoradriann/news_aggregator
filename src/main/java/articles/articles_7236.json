    "title": "Biden Team Reportedly Took Step Toward Killing Natural Gas Project After Meeting With 25-Year-Old TikTok Influencer | The Daily Caller",
    "text": "The White House’s climate team reportedly made a crucial decision regarding a major natural gas project after meeting with a 25-year-old social media influencer, according to The New York Times.\nBefore deciding to delay approval of the Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2), key climate advisers and decision-makers in the White House reportedly met with Alex Haraus, a 25-year-old TikTok influencer from Colorado who has organized an online campaign demanding that the administration kill the project, according to the NYT. The White House is expected to formally announce on Friday that it is delaying its review of CP2, a development which could be the administration’s first step toward killing the project and putting numerous other LNG terminal proposals in jeopardy as well.\nClimate activists “absolutely will reward or punish him on this decision,” Haraus told the NYT, referencing President Joe Biden and the upcoming presidential election. (RELATED: Biden Admin Got Handful Of Undergrads To Write Its Report On Chinese Communist Threat)\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Alex Haraus (@alex.haraus)\nThe White House also rewarded Climate Defiance, a disruptive climate activist group that has targeted administration officials and elected Democrats with their protests, a meeting with senior advisor to the President John Podesta in December 2023. At the meeting, Climate Defiance apparently lobbied Podesta directly to kill CP2.\nBiden is under pressure from the environmentalist left to kill CP2 and other LNG terminals, especially after the administration green lit ConocoPhillips’ massive Willow Project in Alaska last year over vehement opposition of eco-activists. The decision on CP2 could have major ramifications for the upcoming presidential election, as Haraus alluded to the NYT, since young voters and the environmentalist lobby are poised to be key constituencies for Biden in the 2024 race.\nThe natural gas industry ripped the White House’s choice to delay its decision on CP2, writing in a Wednesday letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm that an about-face on allowing proposed LNG export terminals would “hamper U.S. energy leadership and jeopardize American jobs” while “[undermining] global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”\nThe final decision on CP2 and other LNG export terminals may have serious geopolitical ramifications, too. U.S. LNG exports to Europe have increased substantially since Russia invaded Ukraine, and America’s allies on the continent will need continued access to American LNG to meet demand as they wean off Russian supply, the natural gas trade groups wrote in their letter to Granholm.\nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Hamada Hassan told CBS News that no one had enough space in their home to host everyone, so they set up tables outside. It only continued to grow from there.

Local donations fund the costs of the event, which over the years has seen politicians, celebrities, and diplomats in attendance. “We do not care about the cost, as all the residents of the neighborhood participate in financing the table in order to bring joy and happiness to the people of the region and other neighboring areas,\" Ahmed Khalaf, one of the organizers of the 2023 event told [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2284791/middle-east) at the time.",

    "text": "By Kristin Toussaint 2 minute Read After a period of extreme drought, 2023 brought heavy rains to California. In a three-week period alone in January , nine atmospheric rivers—corridors of moisture concentrated in the atmosphere—pummeled the state with rain, leading to landslides , flooding, and levee breaches.\nCalifornia wasn’t alone: Florida saw historic flash floods in April . In May , the Mississippi River reached historic heights, causing flooding. In July, Vermont was hit with catastrophic flooding after days of rain. September marked the wettest month in New York City in more than a century. And intense rain affected other areas across the world: Unrelenting rain led to hundreds of landslides in China in September , and torrential downpours sent deadly floods through Italy in October . These storms were all examples of how climate change can intensify the water cycle , with warmer temperatures increasing the amount of moisture in the air.\nA landslide brought on by heavy rains caused four ocean-view apartment buildings in San Clemente, California, to be evacuated and shuttered due to unstable conditions. Weeks of rain loosened the soil in Orange County, which tumbled down near railroad tracks that run next to the beach below. [Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images] A collection of images from Getty photographers show the extent of these disasters—and provide an important record of these extremes. “Covering natural disasters as a photographer requires you to be in the middle of dangerous situations that the public is usually fleeing from,” Getty Images staff photographer Justin Sullivan said over email. “Our visuals from these disasters provide communities with up-to-the minute conditions on the ground and serve as a record of history.”\nAngel Vega sits in his car waiting for a tow truck after it stalled in flood waters in Hollywood, Florida. The region recorded rainfall totals of more than a foot. [Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images] For years, these photographers have covered climate extremes, from droughts and tornados to wildfires . Covering rain and floods can be especially challenging, as it’s both hard on photographers’ electrical equipment and, Sullivan added, “dangerous to navigate fast moving flood waters that are often filled with chemicals and other debris. You can easily be knocked off your feet if you’re not careful.” When covering flooding, Sullivan often uses a drone as a way to safely show the scale of the disaster.\nadvertisement\nA vehicle drives through floodwaters in the reemerging Tulare Lake in California’s Central Valley. Tulare Lake, once the largest fresh-water body west of the Mississippi River, disappeared when waters were diverted by agricultural interests to irrigate crops in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Atmospheric rivers caused significant flooding in the lake-bed area with more than 100 square miles of farms and other land flooded. [Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images] It can be heartbreaking to look at images of roads overrun with water, people wading through floods, and land broken away by heavy rain. Sullivan hopes that people see these photographs and can prepare themselves for the possibility of it happening to them. After all, climate change is making these disasters more and more common. And these photographs are evidence of that. “Documenting these disasters gives us context and something to measure against as our world continues to change,” said Sullivan.",

    "text": "Vier Jahre nach der Flut-Katastrophe in Nordrhein-Westfalen sind 4,3 Milliarden Euro für den Wiederaufbau bewilligt und 2,2 Milliarden Euro ausgezahlt. Das hat die Landesregierung mitgeteilt.\nDie insgesamt rund 12,3 Milliarden Euro, die zur Verfügung stehen, werden absehbar nicht in voller Höhe benötigt werden, teilte Bauministerin Ina Scharrenbach (CDU) mit. Es seien deutlich mehr der betroffenen Gebäude gegen Elementarrisiken versichert gewesen als zunächst angenommen.\nRund 865 Millionen Euro seien für privat genutzte Wohngebäude und den Ersatz von Hausrat bewilligt worden. Von den mehr als 27.000 Anträgen seien über 98 Prozent abschließend bearbeitet. 85 Prozent der Mittel seien ausgezahlt.\nFür den Wiederaufbau der Infrastruktur in den Kommunen wurden rund 2,8 Milliarden Euro bewilligt. Aktuell seien davon erst rund 903 Millionen Euro ausgezahlt. „Da hakt es in Teilen der Kommunen unverständlicherweise. Wir haben in den letzten Wochen und Monaten noch mal nachgearbeitet und unterstützt“, sagte Scharrenbach dem WDR.\nSo biete das Land den Kommunen die Finanzierung einzelner Bauabschnitte an, damit die Kommunen die Projekte nicht komplett vorfinanzieren müssen. Die übrigen Mittel der insgesamt bewilligten 4,3 Milliarden Euro entfallen auf Unternehmen, die Land- und Forstwirtschaft, die Infrastruktur der Länder, Forschungseinrichtungen sowie Archive.\nBetrugsverdacht bei weniger als einem Prozent der Fälle Von den bewilligten Anträgen seien 320 Betrugsverdachtsfälle mit einem Volumen von 8,8 Millionen Euro identifiziert worden. Dies sei weniger als ein Prozent der Bewilligungen.\nNä, wat ene Driss.\nEs tut uns leid, aber der Inhalt konnte nicht geladen werden. Bitte warten Sie einen Moment. Sollte der Inhalt nicht laden, aktualisieren Sie bitte die Seite.\nWeitere 272 Betrugsfälle seien vor der Bewilligung im Bearbeitungsverfahren aufgedeckt worden. Insgesamt wurden 475 Fälle an die jeweils zuständige Staatsanwaltschaft abgegeben. Bei den übrigen 117 Betrugsverdachtsfällen werde der Sachverhalt weiter aufgeklärt.\nDurch Sturzfluten und Überschwemmungen hatten am 14. und 15. Juli 2021 allein in NRW 49 Menschen ihr Leben verloren. Der Sachschaden erreichte Milliardenhöhe.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250710-930-780450/1\n(dpa)",
