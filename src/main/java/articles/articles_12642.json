    "text": "La Réserve fédérale a laissé ses taux directeurs inchangés pour la quatrième fois de suite, au grand dam de Donald Trump, tout en abaissant les prévisions de croissance de l'économie américaine. Comme attendu, la Réserve fédérale (Fed) américaine n'a pas modifié ses taux, qui guident les coûts d'emprunt des entreprises et des particuliers, craignant une hausse de l'inflation dans un contexte marqué par les droits de douane et les crises géopolitiques.\nLa décision a été prise à l'unanimité selon Reuters. Il s'agissait de la quatrième réunion de la Fed depuis le retour au pouvoir de Donald Trump en janvier. Les trois précédentes se sont déjà conclues par un statu quo sur les taux, situés depuis décembre entre 4,25% et 4,50%.\n\"L'incertitude concernant les perspectives économiques a diminué mais reste élevée\", souligne dans un communiqué la banque centrale.\nLa hausse des droits de douane cette année va vraisemblablement pousser l'inflation\" même s'\"il faut du temps pour (qu'ils) fassent leur chemin à travers la chaîne d'approvisionnement\", a indiqué Jerome Powell, le patron de la Fed.\nSes responsables disent encore envisager deux baisses de taux cette année, une éventualité dont les analystes doutent de plus en plus alors que la Réserve fédérale a annoncé dégrader ses prévisions pour l'économie américaine.\nElle prévoit désormais une croissance de 1,4% du PIB en 2025 (contre 1,7% prévu en mars et 2,1% en décembre 2024) et l'inflation en accélération à +3% (contre 2,7% en mars). Ils anticipent aussi une progression du taux de chômage à 4,5% (contre 4,4% en mars).\n\"Le taux de chômage reste faible et les conditions du marché du travail restent solides\", a toutefois précisé la Fed.\n\"Tant que le marché du…\nP.L",

    "text": "Watch this water bottle freeze in just seconds at the Chiefs game KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Gray News) – Temperatures at the Kansas City Chiefs game this weekend were so cold that water bottles froze instantly when they were taken out of concession stand refrigerators. Game attendee Keely Nadler posted a video on social media that shows her grabbing a Smart Water bottle out of a refrigerator at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday. Within seconds, the water froze completely from top to bottom. The game ended up being the [fourth-coldest game in NFL history](https://www.kctv5.com/2024/01/13/chiefs-dolphins-could-approach-nfl-record-coldest-game/) and the coldest game ever played at Arrowhead Stadium. The official temperature at kickoff was minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, with wind gusts making it feel like minus 27 degrees. The coldest game in NFL history remains minus 13 for the 1967 NFL championship, when the Packers beat the Cowboys at Lambeau Field in a game that came to be known as the Ice Bowl. The wind chill that day was minus 48 degrees. At Saturday’s game, dozens of fans needed medical treatment due to the cold, [KCTV reports](https://www.kctv5.com/2024/01/15/coldest-kc-chiefs-game-ends-with-dozens-fans-needing-emergency-attention/). The Kansas City, Missouri, Fire Department manned ambulances stationed at Arrowhead and responded to a total of 69 calls. Half of the calls were for hypothermia, and 15 people were taken to the hospital. The Chiefs won over the Miami Dolphins 26-7 and head to Buffalo for the AFC Divisional Round. The Chiefs and Bills will play Sunday, Jan. 21 at 5:30 p.m. CT. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "End Of A Love Affair: News Media Quit X Over 'Disinformation' | Barron's",
    "text": "Text size News outlets have begun quitting X, formerly Twitter, once a favourite of global media but now accused of enabling the spread of disinformation under its owner, president-elect Donald Trump ally Elon Musk.\nCiting a \"harsh and extreme\" climate, Sweden's newspaper of reference, the left-liberal Dagens Nyheter (DN), on Friday became third major media outlet to stop publishing its articles on the social media platform.\n\"Since Elon Musk took over, the platform has increasingly merged with his and Donald Trump's political ambitions,\" said editor-in-chief Peter Wolodarski.\nAlready on Wednesday, Britain's centre-left daily The Guardian had announced it would no longer post content from its official accounts on X, which it called \"toxic\".\nA day later, Spain's Vanguardia did the same, saying it would rather lose subscribers than remain on a \"disinformation network\".\nSeveral users had already wondered back in 2022 whether they should remain on Twitter when Musk -- a businessman best known for running car company Tesla and space company SpaceX -- bought the platform and drastically reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.\nThe question has flared up again since Trump won this month's presidential election, actively supported by Musk.\n\"I would expect more publishers to part ways with X,\" said Stephen Barnard, a specialist on media manipulation at Butler University in the US.\n\"How many do so will likely depend on what actions X, Musk, and the Trump administration take with regard to media and journalism,\" he said.\nMusk, who is the world's richest man, has been tapped by Trump's team to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe Guardian has nearly 11 million followers on the platform, but it said \"the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives\".\nIt said \"often disturbing content\" was promoted or found on the platform, singling out \"far-right conspiracy theories and racism\".\nThis falling-out stands in stark contrast to the enthusiasm sparked by Twitter in 2008 and 2009.\nBack then, media felt they had to be present there to establish direct contact with their audiences as well as with experts and decision-makers.\nThey found grew \"audiences, built brands, developed new reporting practices, formed community, strengthened public engagement\", said Barnard.\nAt the same time, they boosted Twitter's influence.\nThis increasingly symbiotic relationship may have become detrimental to the media, suggested Mathew Ingram, former chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review.\n\"Many publishers gave up on reader comments and other forms of interaction and essentially outsourced all of that to social media like Twitter,\" he said.\n\"To that extent they are reaping what they sowed.\"\nCriticism of Twitter predates its takeover by Musk and was centred on the network's architecture that was seen favouring polemical debate and instantaneous indignation.\nIt was also said to give an unbalanced reflection of society, tilting mostly towards higher-income people, and activist users.\nThe precise impact of the decision by newspapers, already in economic crisis, to leave X is not yet clear, but they already expect readerships to dwindle.\n\"We will probably lose subscriptions because some readers subscribe after seeing a news story on the social network,\" Jordi Juan, director of La Vanguardia, told AFP.\nBut Barnard said any such loss would be limited because, said, \"X generates relatively little traffic to news sites compared to other platforms\".\nIn October 2023, six months after American public radio NPR left Twitter, a report from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism deemed the effects of this departure \"negligible\" in terms of traffic.\nOne beneficiary of disenchantment with X appears to be Bluesky, a decentralised social media service offering many of the same functions as X.\nOn Friday, it said it had added one million subscribers within 24 hours. But its 16 million subscribers are still dwarfed by those of X, estimated at several hundreds of millions.\n\"Strictly speaking, there are no alternatives to what X offers today,\" Vincent Berthier, head of the technology department at RSF (Reporters Without Borders) told AFP.\n\"But we may need to invent them.\"\nBerthier called departures from X \"a symptom of the failure of democracies to regulate platforms\" across the board.\nMusk may represent \"the radical face of this informational nightmare\", said Berthier. \"But the problem goes much deeper.\"\npr/jh/sjw/jj",

    "text": "Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday it is the duty of the world’s Muslim nations to prevent “goods, oil and fuel” from reaching Israel\nDec. 23 (UPI) — Iran’s supreme leader on Saturday urged Muslim countries to prevent vital supplies from reaching Israel as the United States accused his country of “deep involvement” in attacks by Yemeni rebels against international shipping.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, during a meeting in Tehran with people from the Iranian provinces of Kerman and Khuzestan, denounced Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza as “bloodthirsty and cruel” and called on Islamic governments to take action against materiel heading to Israel.\nIt is the duty of Muslim nations “to prevent goods, oil and fuel from reaching the Zionist regime, the regime which itself has blocked off water access to the people of Gaza,” Khamenei said, according to official news accounts.\nAt the same time, the supreme leader “denounced some Islamic states for their criminal act of assistance towards the Zionist regime,” official media said.\nThe Iranian leader’s comments came hours after a U.S. National Security Council official released declassified information purporting to closely link Tehran with recent attacks against civilian shipping in the Red Sea carried out pro-Iranian Houthi rebels.\nIran has been “deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,” NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement issued to CNN late Friday.\nWatson said the the newly declassified intelligence suggests that Iranian support “throughout the Gaza crisis has enabled the Houthis to launch attacks against Israel and maritime targets, though Iran has often deferred operational decision-making authority to the Houthis.”\nShe added indications also point to Iran providing “tactical intelligence” to the Yemeni rebels since the assaults on international commercial shipping began last month.\nThe attacks have created chaos in the region of the Red Sea and Suez Canal, which funnels 12% of global maritime trade, according to Bloomberg. Major container and oil shippers such as Danish giant Maersk have rerouted vessels away from the Red Sea as Houthi militias seek to respond to Israel’s war with Hamas.\nEarlier this week the United States unveiled a new multinational military initiative to counter the Houthi attacks, saying they will do whatever it takes to stop the threats.\n“Operation Prosperity Guardian” was launched with ships and aircraft “from multiple nations” conducting maritime surveillance and set to take defensive action to protect commercial ships from Houthi threats, U.S. officials said.",
