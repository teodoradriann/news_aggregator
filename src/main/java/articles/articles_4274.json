    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Allowing the appointments of non-Muslim experts in the Syariah committee will only spark unnecessary controversy in Malaysia's multi-religious society, says Umno's secretary-general.\nDatuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki was responding to a suggestion made by DAP Beruas Member of Parliament Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham that non-Muslim constitutional experts should be appointed to the committee to review the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.\n\"Umno categorically rejects the proposal by Ngeh on the appointment of non-Muslim experts in the committee to study the powers of the Shariah Court with respect to the Federal Constitution.\n\"The proposal is unnecessary and out of touch with reality.\n\"It would only spark unnecessary controversy and instigate polemic within the peace-loving multi-religious and multi-racial society,\" Asyraf said in a statement on Friday (Dec 29).\nALSO READ: Ngeh's statement on appointment of non-Muslim was an oversight, says Loke\nHe said that since independence, it has been acknowledged and clearly stipulated in the Federal Constitution that the Syariah Court is specifically for Muslims.\nAsyraf said all quarters should put their trust and confidence in the committee as they are appointed by the Selangor Sultan, who is also the Islamic Affairs National Council chairman.\n\"The process of improving and elevating the Syariah Court, since Umno led the previous government, has always been implemented gradually, considering the scope of powers allowed by the Federal Constitution.\n\"Moreover, throughout the process of upgrading the Syariah Court, which includes aspects of administration, competence, emoluments and salaries of judges and officials, as well as the form and level of punishment stipulated under the court's jurisdiction, it has never infringed upon or violated the rights of non-Muslim citizens.\n\"I believe whatever the outcome of the study will never infringe the rights of non-Muslims and go beyond the jurisdictions provided by the Federal Constitutions,\" he added.\nALSO READ: Beruas MP has gone overboard with his statement, says Bersatu\nIn a statement on Thursday (Dec 28), Ngeh said it is important to appoint non-Muslim constitutional experts to the committee so that non-Muslim views with regard to the provisions in the Federal Constitution could be taken into account before proposals for changes in the law are made.\nIn November, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the government would form the special committee sanctioned by the Conference of Rulers while the formation of the committee was announced on Dec 5.\nHe said the rulers have consented to the committee studying ways to enhance the powers of the Syariah Court over Muslims while ensuring that it would not affect non-Muslims.\nAccording to reports, the committee would also review the competency of state legislatures in formulating Syariah laws.\nThe 11-member committee is headed by former chief justice Tun Zaki Azmi while other members include former federal court judge Datuk Seri Mohd Zawawi Salleh, Selangor Islamic council member Datuk Salehuddin Saidin, Melaka Chief Syariah judge Datuk Nadzri Abdul Rahman.\nAdditionally, those part of the committee are Attorney-General's Chambers Syariah and law harmonisation division head Datuk Anas Ahmad Zakie, civil division deputy head Shamsul Bolhassan and constitutional research unit chief Azirul Liza Abdullah.\nOthers include the International Islamic University of Malaysia legal dean Prof Dr Farid Sufian Shuaib and Prof Datuk Dr Wan Ahmad Fauzi Hashim, Malaysian Syariah Lawyers Association president Musa Awang and Syariah lawyer Dr Zulqarnain Lukman.\nOpen Modal ×",

Más de medio millar de centros como este acogen ya a 70.100 personas que en los últimos días han huido de una campaña de ataques israelíes sin precedentes, principalmente desde la región meridional, como una anciana albergada en esta escuela junto a su hija y dos de sus nietos.

    "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday apologized for the incorrect translation of a verse from Bhagavad Gita on his social media handle. The post triggered accusations of promoting caste divisions in the state.\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Sarma wrote, “As a routine, I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas.\"\nHe acknowledged the mistake and attributed it to an error made by a team member. “Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation,\" the chief minister said.\n“As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society , thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva. If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,\" Sarma added.\nThe post which read that serving the Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras, has sparked a political row among opposition leaders.\nAIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the chief minister elaborated on his vision of society. “In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras\",\" he said.\n“Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It’s reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam’s Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,\" Owaisi added.\nCPI(M) strongly denounced Assam CM's tweet claiming that \"Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas\". “BJPs Manuvadi ideology in full play!\" it wrote on the microblogging site.\nCongress leader Pawan Khera asked whether the President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed with Sarma's comments on castes.\n\"And then if you say something to him, he will send his cops. But such stupid comments cannot be ignored. Do @rashtrapatibhvn and @PMOIndia agree with @himantabiswa’s casteist comments?\" he said.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Britain, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, erstwhile coal-burning imperial behemoth, wants to be a “ clean energy superpower.”\nAt least that’s the promise of the man poised to be the next prime minister, Keir Starmer. His Labour Party was projected to win the parliamentary elections on Thursday, ending 14 years of Conservative Party rule.\nLabour made big campaign promises on climate. How that actually plays out will be felt not only in the daily lives of people in Britain, but also on the nation’s standing in the world.\nBritain is one of history’s major climate polluters. It’s where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases. So the speed and scale of Britain’s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other industrialized countries and emerging economies alike.\nBritain likes to think of itself as a global climate leader. In 2008, it became the first among major industrialized countries to pass a climate change law . Its emissions have dramatically fallen since then. In 2021, its government set a legally binding target to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by 78 percent by 2035 , relative to 1990 levels, in one of the most ambitious climate laws in the world.\nGetting there, though, is the hard part. The new government will face a cost-of-living crisis at home, geopolitical turbulence abroad and a battery of extreme weather events exacerbated by the rise in fossil-fuel emissions.\nHere are three things to watch as the new government gets to work.\nWhat will it take to pivot away from fossil fuels? Mr. Starmer’s campaign manifesto promised “zero-carbon electricity by 2030.”\nLucky for him, the country is already on its way there.\nIt no longer counts on coal to generate the bulk of its electricity. The last coal-burning power plant is slated to shut down in September. Coal has gone from supplying 40 percent of its electricity in 2012 to near zero today, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief , an independent climate news site.\nThe challenge now is to reduce reliance on gas. In 2023, it supplied a little over 30 percent of Britain’s electricity. The government must reduce that to zero by 2030, or find ways to capture and bury the greenhouse gases that gas plants produce.\nThe Labour Party’s leaders have also said they would double wind capacity on land, quadruple wind capacity offshore and triple solar power.\nJoss Garman, executive director at the European Climate Foundation, called the zero-carbon-electricity promise a “stretch goal” that would require changing the laws of the approval of wind and solar projects.\nWhat’s the future of North Sea oil? Oil extraction in the North Sea has steadily declined over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to drop through midcentury.\nStill, the question of oil and gas licenses in the North Sea is politically charged.\nLast year, the incumbent Conservative Party prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said Britain should “max out” North Sea oil and gas. He put in place a system to issue new licenses , prompting the resignation of a former energy minister, who said it would cause “future harm.”\nMr. Starmer’s party has said it would honor the existing licenses but refrain from issuing new ones.\nOil and gas companies already face a 75 percent tax in Britain. The incoming Labour government has said it would slightly increase that to 78 percent.\nThere’s another wrinkle, and that’s Scotland.\nScottish nationalists have pressed for a greater say over North Sea oil and gas, because it’s in Scottish waters. The decline of production there is likely to be felt first and most acutely by communities along Scotland’s northeastern coast, which depend on the industry for jobs.\nWill climate action remain polarizing? Unlike in the United States, there was broad political consensus in Britain around the need to address climate change. In fact, climate action was a conservative darling.\nFormer Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the alarm on climate change. Theresa May , also a conservative prime minister, led the charge for a net-zero target by 2050, which means that Britain, by law, must take out as much greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere as the country injects into it by midcentury. In 2021, Boris Johnson’s government pledged to reduce emissions by 78 percent by 2035.\nRecently, that goal has changed. Mr. Sunak cast the green transition as too costly. For example, what was to be a 2030 ban on new petroleum and diesel-powered cars was pushed back to 2035.\nMr. Starmer is likely to restore the ban to 2030. He has also promised to double funding for energy efficiency programs and create a new national energy company that he says will cut energy bills .\nAt the same time, there’s pressure from the far-right Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, to drop the net-zero-by-2050 target altogether. Exit polls project Mr. Farage’s party to have a surprisingly large foothold in Parliament, reflecting the rise of the far right across Europe.\nThe post Can the Labour Party Bring Back Britain’s Green Groove? appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "1 - Seules trois grandes puissances ont manifesté leur inquiétude\nUne \"préoccupation sérieuse\" pour le Japon. La Nouvelle-Zélande a déclaré mercredi que l'essai de missile balistique chinois dans le Pacifique Sud était \"malvenu et préoccupant\", et s'est engagée à consulter ses alliés au fur et à mesure que les détails se précisent. Le porte-parole du gouvernement japonais Yoshimasa Hayashi a annoncé quant à lui qu'\"il n'y a eu aucun préavis de la part de la Chine\" concernant le lancement. Yoshimasa Hayashi a également indiqué que le renforcement rapide de la puissance militaire de Pékin et son manque de transparence constituent une \"préoccupation sérieuse\" pour son pays. Les missiles balistiques intercontinentaux font partie des armes les plus puissantes au monde et peuvent transporter des charges nucléaires dévastatrices.\nC'est probablement la première fois depuis des décennies que nous assistons à un tel essai\nAnkit Panda. chercheur à la Fondation Carnegie pour la paix internationale\n\"Ce test \"témoigne probablement de la modernisation nucléaire en cours de la part de la Chine, qui se manifeste par de nouveaux besoins en matière d'essais\", conclut la Fondation dans un communiqué.\nUne fusée \"longue marche\" lors du traditionnel défilé des troupes • ©Droits réserv\n2 -Le tir a été annoncé par les autorités chinoises et il est tombé à l'endroit prévu\n «Il est tombé avec précision dans la zone maritime prédéterminée» , a déclaré le ministère chinois de la Défense sans préciser d’où il avait été tiré, ni dans quelle zone il avait atterri. Les essais de missiles balistiques intercontinentaux chinois dans les eaux internationales sont rares. Selon plusieurs experts et une étude historique du programme chinois réalisée par la Nuclear Threat Initiative, basée à Washington, le dernier essai remonte à mai 1980 quand Pékin avait lancé son missile DF-5 dans le Pacifique Sud.\nCe nouveau tir est d’autant plus inédit qu’il a été annoncé par le ministère de la Défense lui-même, en général discret sur ces choses.\n3 -Eric Spitz temporise dans son discours de ce mercredi\nCe mercredi soir lors de la Fête Nationale de la République populaire de Chine, Eric Spitz, le Haut-Commissaire de la République s'est fendu de 5 lignes sur la position française, dominée par un silence assourdissant de Matignon et de l'Elysée. \"Je ne suis pas habilité à faire un commentaire qui relèverai de l’échelon ministériel. À mon niveau, je me contenterai de faire les trois observations suivantes. Tout d’abord et de manière évidente, ce missile emportait une tête inerte, c’est-à-dire sans explosif. Ensuite, il est tombé dans les eaux internationales de l’océan Pacifique. Enfin, les autorités chinoises avaient préalablement notifié cet essai à leurs homologues tricolores\".\nles autorités françaises ne manqueront pas de faire connaître le moment venu, et si elles l’estiment nécessaire leur position sur ce tir\nEric Spitz, Haut-Commissaire de la République en Polynésie Française\n4- Toutes les grandes puissances se testent à coup de tirs de missiles balistiques\nLe dernier tir en date, côté occidental, est sans doute celui du 4 Juin 2024. A 00h56 (09h56 heure de Paris), le pas de tir de la base spatiale de Vandenberg (Californie, États-Unis) s'illuminait dans la nuit noire. L'armée américaine tirait un missile balistique intercontinental (ICBM) Minuteman III dans le cadre d'un essai. Pour l'occasion, le missile était équipé d'un seul véhicule de rentrée. Pour rappel, les ICBM Minuteman III sont normalement équipés d'un certain nombre d'ogives thermonucléaires, celles-ci étant chacune placées dans un véhicule de rentrée, permettant à l'ogive stratégique de rentrer dans l'atmosphère sans se désagréger. L'engin terminait sa course près des Iles Marshall.\nle Président Xi Jinping \"a fait preuve d''une relative transparence\" lors de ses dernières opérations militaires • ©Crédits : Turar Kazangapov\n5- Personne n'a intérêt à se fâcher avec la Chine\nDans un contexte géopolitique mondial marqué par la ligne de front ukrainienne et l'embrasement au Proche-Orient, l'axe axe russo-chinois voulu par le Président Poutine n'a jamais autant inquiété les experts de l'Otan: livraisons d'armes ocultes, posture diplomatique...\nLa tâche la plus urgente qui incombe à l'ONU est d'arrêter de se courber devant la pression de la République populaire de Chine et sa volonté expansionniste vers Taïwan. L'armée chinoise mène régulièrement d'importantes manoeuvres depuis Juillet 2020 dans le détroit de la Mer de Chine méridional de Taîwan. La Chine peut donc tout à la fois être un médiateur avec Vladimir Poutine, autant qu' avec la Corée du Nord. Tout en imposant son arsenal nucléaire dans la dissuation infernationale: elle dispose de 300 silos pour missiles balistiques à longue portée et souhaite en doubler le nombre d'ici 2030.",
