    "title": "Stalker 2 dev apologizes for banning player who said system reqs were a “lie”",
    "text": "Stalker 2 fans are calling out the game’s developer after a massive shift in system requirements, which require upscaling technologies such as AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS to hit the stated frame rates. The situation got a little hot around the collar, with one critical fan being banned from the game’s Steam forums, prompting an apology from the developer.\nGSC Game World changed the Stalker 2 system requirements considerably, and quite close to launch. The original specs were published when the game was expected in 2021. Since the war in Ukraine and a move to Unreal Engine 5 caused significant delays, Stalker 2 has been through a tumultuous development cycle.\nThe banned player called out GSC over masking information surrounding resolution upscaling tech, such as Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR. The official chart published by the studio makes no mention of these technologies being required to run the game at the designated presets.\nThe upscaler information was allegedly only discovered through a reply on Discord by the game’s community manager. In a screenshot, community manager Mol1t said, that in order “to achieve the specified performance at medium, high, and epic settings, you need to use DLSS, TSR, and their analogues.”\nUser Pirat_Nation on X posted a screenshot of their banning, which was attributed to “Spreading fake [information] about the company,” and said “they lied” when referring to the original system requirements. GSC was quick to hop onto X and reverse the ban, stating in a post that a new moderator made a “mistake with this topic,” adding that the developer was “so sorry.”\nThe studio also reiterated this in an additional message on the Steam forums. Responding to a post about the banning, a GSC staff member claimed that the new team had “overdone” their job “a bit.”\nUpscalers and frame generation are now a hot discussion on the forums. Some players are claiming that the industry’s overreliance on the technology is “very worrying,” while others have devolved into arguments, as expected.\nStalker 2 is set to be quite an intensive game to run on PC, with 32GB of RAM recommended for high settings, along with one of the best graphics cards available today. With the Stalker 2 release date just days away, we’ll have to wait for the real-world tests to come in before we can pass judgment.",

    "title": "Homes face second night without power as Storm Gerrit clean up under way",
    "text": "Around 1,500 homes in Scotland faced a second night without power after Storm Gerrit battered the country with heavy rain, wind and snow. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” As part of SSEN’s support package, customers who will be without power for more than 12 hours are entitled to £30 per person for every day without power to cover the cost of food and drink. Customers on SSEN’s Priority Service Register can also claim “reasonable” costs for alternative accommodation if it is expected they will be without power for more than 24 hours. Network Rail confirmed on Friday morning that all lines which had previously been closed following the adverse weather had now reopened, with the exception of Dumfries – Kilmarnock. The final route is expected to open later on Friday morning. Traffic Scotland said that the A82 between Invergarry and Invermoriston remains closed due to fallen trees on the carriageway on Friday. The A96 has reopened in both directions at Huntly. And six people were rescued from vehicles stuck in flood water in Banchory. Ferry operator CalMac announced a series of cancellations, delays and time changes to a number of services on Friday. Passengers are advised to check for updates on CalMac’s X account.

Mal ele sabia que o seu maior “segredo” acabara de ser descoberto pelos pais - é homossexual e escondia esta realidade desde que se lembra. Eles, evangélicos praticantes, não eram o único desafio que aquele adolescente teria de enfrentar, era também a sua própria religião e toda uma congregação que o viu crescer, para mais tarde o levar a fazer uma escolha: a terapia ou as represálias. Escolheu a primeira via. Mas este não é um caso isolado. Apesar de o Parlamento ter aprovado há quatro meses a sua criminalização, ainda há quem promova a conversão da orientação sexual ou da identidade de género dentro de grandes grupos cristãos. Esta realidade vive-se ainda hoje no país e há relatos dentro de várias e diferentes igrejas protestantes e restauracionistas de repressões e até tentativas de conversão de jovens e adultos homossexuais e transgénero. As quatro histórias que se seguem foram vividas dentro dos portões da Igreja Evangélica e do betel das Testemunhas de Jeová.",
