    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 29 : Megastar Amitabh Bachchan shared an anecdote about the veteran actress Helen, and talked about how she had escaped from the Japanese occupation of Burma in 1943, during the World War 2, and came to India. Helen is a well known dancer and is known for her character roles. Born in Rangoon, Burma (now known as Myanmar), Helen's family trekked to Dibrugarh, Assam in 1943 in order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma. Later on, Helen got her major break at the age of 19 in 1958, when she performed on the song 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu' in the movie 'Howrah Bridge'. With legendary actor Shammi Kapoor, she did many hit dance numbers like 'Suku Suku' in 'Junglee', 'Yamma Yamma' in 'China Town', and 'O Haseena Zulfonwali' in 'Teesri Manzil'. Amitabh, who is currently hosting the quiz based reality show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati 15' welcomed the roll over contestant Lalit Kumar to the hot seat. For Rs 25 lakh, he was asked: \"Which of these actresses was born in Myanmar and later escaped with her family to India during the Second World War?\" The options given were -- Sulochana, Suraiya, Nadira, and Helen. The correct answer was Helen. However, Lalit was not sure about the answer, hence he decided to quit the show, and took the price money of Rs 12,50,000. Amitabh then went on to say, \"Helen and her family escaped Myanmar...called Burma back then. In order to escape and come to India, they had to trek alternately through miles of wilderness passing through rivers, mountains and forests. In order to escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma, she had to do this in 1943.\" \"She became a popular actress in our film industry. Watching her dance would leave one enthralled,\" shared the 'Brahmastra' actor. Helen has shared screen with Big B in the movies like 'Mohabbatein', 'Don', 'Sholay', 'Amar Akbar Anthony', 'The Great Gambler' and 'Ram Balram'. In the movie 'Sholay', she had a special appearance in the track 'Mehbooba Mehbooba'. Talking about the same, Amitabh added: \"I had the good fortune of working with her in a few films. She's a kind and compassionate woman. She used to look after everyone. We pray she stays in good health. She's old now.\"",

Haniyeh ha chiamato direttamente i due leader al telefono.\nIl team negoziale israeliano, guidato dal capo del Mossad David Barnea, ha ricevuto e sta studiando la risposta di Hamas ai mediatori egiziani. «Stiamo verificando la proposta e le sue conseguenze», ha detto una fonte citata dai media.\nIl sì di Hamas arriva dopo che Israele aveva avviato l'evacuazione di Rafah e il Gabinetto di guerra aveva approvato l'offensiva, prevista per i prossimi giorni, che può essere fermata solo dalla tregua.\n(Unioneonline/s.s.)\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "El Ministerio de Salud volvió a sacar una carta en todo el lío que se armó por el reajuste que ordenó la Corte Constitucional al pago de la Unidad de Pago por Capitación (UPC), el valor que se reconoce por cada afiliado al sistema de salud. En esa misiva, el MinSalud radicó una solicitud para que se anule un auto del alto tribunal en ese tema. Dicha solicitud la presentó el director jurídico (e) del Ministerio de Salud, Rodolfo Enrique Salas Figueroa, quien argumentó las razones para que la alta corte anule la sentencia que declaró la insuficiencia de la UPC de 2024. En el documento se detalla que la solicitud de nulidad se basa sobre las actuaciones que pueden presentar defectos fácticos o jurídicos, como la violación al debido proceso, a la defensa y a la contracción del Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social. En el documento se detalla que la solicitud de nulidad se basa sobre las actuaciones que pueden presentar defectos fácticos o jurídicos, como la violación al debido proceso, a la defensa y a la contracción del Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social.Tras hacerse oficial la solicitud por parte del Ministerio de Salud, pacientes, profesionales de la salud, usuarios, sociedades científicas, prestadores y actores del sistema de salud se pronunciaron y reiteraron su apoyo a la decisión que tomó la Corte Constitucional en el Auto 007 de 2025, que responde a un riguroso seguimiento de la Sentencia T-760 de 2008, la cual le ordenó al Estado garantizar la suficiencia de los recursos destinados a la salud de los colombianos. “La nulidad solicitada por el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social se interpreta como una dilación infundada en el cumplimiento de las órdenes judiciales y supone un grave retroceso en la protección del derecho fundamental a la salud, especialmente para los pacientes con enfermedades crónicas, de alto costo, huérfanas y población en general”, se puede leer en la misiva firmada por varios médicos, pacientes y sociedades científicas.De acuerdo con esta comunidad, la alta corte fue clara al indicar que es competente para supervisar el cumplimiento de la Sentencia T-760 de 2008. “Su decisión se basa en pruebas y análisis técnicos que evidencian el desfinanciamiento del sistema”.“Los efectos negativos de esta crisis afectan gravemente a la atención de miles de personas y a la garantía del reconocimiento del derecho fundamental a la salud en el país. En este sentido, es imprescindible que las órdenes impartidas se cumplan conforme a lo establecido en la Constitución y la ley, con el fin de asegurar la estabilidad y sostenibilidad del sistema de salud”, alertaron desde esta comunidad. Esta comunidad médica le solicitó a la Corte Constitucional para que rechace la solicitud del Ministerio de Salud de pedir la nulidad. Además, les pide que tome una decisión que corresponda con base en la justicia, priorizando la protección inmediata y efectiva de derecho a la salud. Por otra parte, esta comunidad le exige al Ministerio de Salud que, en vez de estar cuestionando las decisiones judiciales, tomen las medidas correctivas para garantizar la salud de los colombianos. “Es esencial que sus acciones respondan a la realidad del país y se orienten a implementar medidas concretas que permitan superar la crisis de financiación que afecta a millones de colombianos”.Esta comunidad médica cerró la carta explicando que “la nulidad procesal que se está presentando busca eludir la responsabilidad del ministerio en la garantía del derecho a la salud y perpetuar una crisis de financiación que afecta a los millones de colombianos que hoy dependen del sistema de salud para disfrutar de una mejor calidad de vida”.",

    "text": "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - For an Iowa man, the start of 2024 will bring a lot of change to his normal routine as he retires from supermarket chain Hy-Vee after almost five decades.\nIt’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around, but after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and his boss insisted on the special ride to work.\nOutside the West Des Moines supermarket was a display celebrating Mick’s years of service.\n“That’s amazing,” Mick said. “Wow. It’s about all I can say.”\nInside the store, countless hugs and congratulations from family, friends and former colleagues showed the impact Mick had on the community. He started at Hy-Vee behind the meat counter in 1975 when he was just 16.\n“He’s the same person today: extremely nice, extremely thoughtful, willing to help the customers,” longtime colleague Marilyn Cook said.\n“He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” said Mick’s daughter, Kerri Driscoll.\nMick worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career, his last being the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway.\n“It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul, and it’s been well worth it.”\nAs the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at Mick’s party is a hint as to what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family.\n“I’m going to let life happen to me, enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said.\nMick’s co-workers say he will be missed after bringing smiles to people during his nearly five decades on the job.\nCopyright 2024 KCCI via CNN Newsource.
