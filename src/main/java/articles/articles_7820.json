    "text": "Em meio às comemorações pela sua primeira conquista oficial na carreira, Damian Lillard terá que ficar de molho por alguns dias. Após vencer o título da NBA Cup pelo Milwaukee Bucks na terça-feira (17), o armador está listado como desfalque para a partida contra o Cleveland Cavaliers, nesta sexta-feira (20) .\nDe acordo com as informações divulgadas pelos Bucks, o jogador sofreu um estiramento na panturrilha direita. Ainda não se sabe se a contusão aconteceu na final do torneio, contra o Oklahoma City Thunder , ou mesmo antes disso. Até então, o camisa 0 perdeu apenas três partidas ao longo da temporada.\nNa decisão, Damian Lillard marcou 23 pontos, quatro rebotes e quatro assistências, acertando cinco bolas do perímetro em dez tentativas. Já em 2024-25, suas médias são de 25,7 pontos, 4,5 rebotes, 7,5 assistências 37,1% de aproveitamento nas bolas de três pontos. O armador vem sendo peça fundamental na recuperação de Milwaukee nas últimas semanas.\nDepois de ter começado a temporada com oito derrotas e apenas duas vitórias, a franquia de Wisconsin engatou uma sequência de 12 triunfos e três reveses. Giannis Antetokounmpo , que também é dúvida para o duelo contra os Cavaliers, vem tendo atuações excelentes. Assim, o grego já se consolidou como um dos principais candidatos ao prêmio de MVP.",

    "text": "Medioambiente El Supremo de EEUU frena otra medida de Biden para luchar contra la contaminación La mayoría conservadora deja en suspenso una regulación que trata de limitar la contaminación que viaja entre estados Idoya Noain Los esfuerzos por proteger y mejorar el medioambiente en [Estados Unidos](/tags/estados-unidos/) desde el gobierno federal han topado con un enemigo formidable en el Tribunal Supremo dominado por los conservadores. Este jueves cinco de los seis jueces de esa supermayoría conservadora han obligado a echar el freno a una medida adoptada por la Agencia de Protección Ambiental (EPA por sus siglas en inglés) con la que el gobierno de [Joe Biden ](/tags/joe-biden/)pretendía reducir la contaminación de ozono que viaja de unos estados a otros provocando niebla tóxica que se ha vinculado a asma, enfermedades pulmonares y muertes prematuras. Se trata de la tercera decisión en los tres últimos años que este Supremo toma contra medidas gubernamentales para combatir el cambio climático y reducir emisiones y contaminación. Llega después de otras dos adoptadas contra la misma agencia por las que le forzó a reducir protecciones al agua y le impidió aplicar un ambicioso plan para reducir emisiones de plantas de carbón. Esa tendencia ha llevado a expertos como Charles Harper, del grupo contra el cambio climático Evergreen, a denunciar que el Alto Tribunal demuestra que “cada vez más sustituye con sus propias políticas de derechas la pericia de las agencias federales”. \"Buenos vecinos\" La norma que el Supremo ha dejado en suspenso formaba parte de un plan que la EPA empezó a diseñar en 2015 amparándose en la Ley de Aire Limpio para reducir la [contaminación ](/tags/contaminacion/)y la niebla tóxica que viaja de estados con muchas emisiones, normalmente en el sureste y el medio oeste, a otros que tienen menos, principalmente en el noreste. Esa regulación conocida como “de buen vecino” obligaba a los estados a enviar propuestas para reducir emisiones de ozono en plantas eléctricas y en otras instalaciones industriales que luego debía aprobar la agencia. Para 2023 la EPA concluyó que los planes presentados por 23 estados no eran adecuados y adoptó su propia normativa, lo que abrió una batalla legal. En 11 de los estados sí se aplicó la normativa federal y se han visto reducciones notables de las emisiones. De hecho, el año pasado en esos estados se registró una reducción total del 18% óxido de nitrógeno. Otros 12 mantuvieron su batalla legal, argumentando que les preocupa que en el futuro puedan cambiarse sus obligaciones bajo el plan y denunciando que las nuevas regulaciones son demasiado onerosas y llevarán al límite su servicio eléctrico. Esas batallas legales estaban abiertas pero en febrero Ohio, Virginia Occidental e Indiana, con aliados en sectores de industria pesada y minería, lograron que el Supremo aceptara una solicitud de emergencia, algo extraño pues el Alto Tribunal suele esperar a que se resuelvan los litigios en instancias inferiores. Solo Amy Coney Barrett, nombrada por [Donald Trump](/tags/donald-trump/), se ha sumado a las tres juezas progresistas rechazando la decisión, que ahora devuelve la pelea legal a tribunales inferiores pero deja la regulación suspendida mientras se resuelven los casos, un proceso que puede prolongarse durante años.

    "title": "Cracking the Cosmological Puzzle: A Comprehensive Simulation Study - TIme News",
    "text": "2024-04-11 17:00:00\nA particularly comprehensive simulation study has expanded the range of parameters that can explain how the universe is built – but has still not managed to crack a disturbing cosmological puzzle\nEver since physics was freed from the shackles of philosophy, around the time of Newton, it has been dominated by the view that sees the experiment as the final arbiter. However, nowadays there is another dominant player in the research field – simulation. Its role is so important that there is almost no existence for modern research in physics without the simulations: sterile virtual environments designed to replace, precede or confirm the findings of experiments and observations.\nSimulations are especially powerful in the study of astrophysics and cosmology. It is partly due to the enormous size of the universe, because of which there are things that cannot be measured easily, and things that cannot be measured at all. The James B. Space Telescope launched at the end of 2021, greatly advanced the capabilities of observational astrophysics, but in many areas the difficulty remains, and simulations are still an essential tool. A new system of cosmological simulations called Flamingo (FLAMINGO – the initials of a long name whose meaning is not important for our purposes), now wants to shed light on the question of “S8 stretching” – one of the most challenging and hot puzzles in space exploration.\nSimulations are especially powerful in the study of astrophysics and cosmology. A simulation of the formation of the universe Patrick Landmann / Science Photo Library\nWhat do we know that we don’t know? The leading models in the study of cosmology explain how the universe was created And what will probably be the end. Between the beginning and the end, cosmological dynamics drives the universe. The standard model of cosmology, called Lambda-CDM (acronym for “cold dark matter to matter”), includes a limited set of parameters that fit a rich variety of cosmological and gravitational data. It is possible to build a model of a universe that is mostly complex from dark matter and from dark energy, to fit these parameters.\nTo understand what dark matter and dark energy are, one must know that the measured accelerations of bodies in the galaxy do not conform to Newton’s laws , which are the governing laws in the classical mechanics of bodies such as stars, planets, gas clouds and more. Experiments show that the matter moves too fast relative to the amount of mass – and if so, why doesn’t it detach from the galaxy? In addition, the speed of the material at the edges of the galaxy does not decrease as you move away from its center, as should happen assuming that all the mass is concentrated inside the galaxy.\nFrom statistical calculations and calculations based on the accelerations of the celestial bodies and Newton’s second law, it appears that the mass of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is approx. 580 billion solar masses and there are those who believe that even more . The mass of all the visible matter in the galaxy is about 46 to 64.3 billion solar masses, so the mass of the gas we know of its existence by observation is at most 10-15 percent of the mass of the entire galaxy. A simple calculation shows that there is a lot of missing mass. And in other words, we don’t know how to explain 85 percent of the gravity in the universe. The prevailing, but not the only, explanation for this gap is that there is dark matter in the universe, which cannot be detected by conventional means simply because it does not maintain any interaction with the electromagnetic force.\nAnother unexplained phenomenon is that there seems to be a force pushing the galaxies away from each other, against the effect of gravity pulling them towards each other. The galaxies in the universe are moving away from each other at an increasing speed, although gravity is supposed to decrease the speed at which they are moving away. The name given to this mysterious force, whose origin we do not know, is “dark energy”. These two concepts are a puzzle and not a solution, because they balance the equations with the observations, but we know nothing about their nature.\nThe standard model of cosmology includes a limited set of parameters that fit a rich variety of cosmological and gravitational data. Illustration of the model, from the Big Bang to the present NASA/ LAMBDA Archive / WMAP Science Team\nProf. Rani Bodnik From the Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute of Science, he is a cosmologist who studies the north of dark matter with the help of experiments. In a conversation with the Davidson Institute website, he says: “Our understanding of the universe, as it is reflected from the Big Bang and measurements of the cosmic background radiation – which is, in a sense, a greeting from the past, from the beginning of the universe – provides answers to most of the essential questions, and takes into account almost exclusively the dark matter, Because he is the one who determines the dynamics on the cosmological scale.”\nAs you probably understand, here comes a big “but”. “In the last 10-12 years, cosmologists have started asking questions about what happens near the centers of galaxies,” Bodnik adds. “Galaxies and stars and the entire world known to us are made of what is called ‘baryonic matter’, and near the centers of galaxies the cosmology begins to change and strange phenomena occur. For them the usual simulations will no longer provide the goods.”\nThus, the new simulations, the result of the work of researchers from universities in Great Britain and the Netherlands, take into account not only parts of the universe while ignoring the rest, as their predecessors did, but a much larger amount of parameters and components that may be involved in cosmological dynamics.\nThis time dark matter and dark energy were taken into account, as well as baryonic matter, which many previous simulations ignored simply because its contribution to gravity is low compared to dark matter. Neutrino particles were also taken into account, which are the lightest elementary particles known to particle physicists today, and which also do not interact with the electromagnetic force.\nWe do not know how to explain 85 percent of the gravity in the universe. The prevailing explanation for this gap is that dark matter exists in the universe. Simulation of the distribution of dark matter in the universe Volker Springel / Max Planck Institute For Astrophysics / Science Photo Library\nThe bully you don’t want to mess with “Exact calculations that do not ignore the baryonic matter are bordering on the impossible,” Bodnik says. “The interactions they have are incredibly complicated, so these calculations usually introduce the baryonic matter as a disturbance and in a phenomenological form, that is, one where the emphasis is on matching observations and less on theoretical accuracy.”\nThe baryonic matter interacts with the electromagnetic force, which is manifested in the radiation and pressure it exerts, as well as in galactic winds – which we do not know how to predict and it is difficult to plant them in models. These galactic winds are fast gusts and streams of gas that are ejected during the formation of new stars, or those that result from supermassive black holes and other powerful cosmological events.\nThis time the spirits were introduced into the simulations using machine learning algorithms, which has also stormed into astrophysics and cosmology in recent years, and their dynamics are described using tools from the field of fluid mechanics.\nTo all of these is added a certain tension, a discrepancy known as “S8 tensions”. This tension is manifested primarily in unexpected changes in the density distribution of galaxies; A kind of unknown secret related to the behavior of gravity, which science knows – or at least thinks it knows.\nS8 is a measure of changes in the density of matter in the universe: how uneven the distribution of matter is. And in technical terms – how inhomogeneous the universe is. The value of this measure can be calculated using the Standard Model of Cosmology and measurements of the cosmic background radiation; And independently, it can also be calculated through measurements of weak gravitational distortion – a phenomenon in which the gravitational field of objects with a very high mass bends light rays from the environment, much like an optical lens does. But there is a problem – these two calculations do not agree with each other. This mismatch is stretching S8.\n“S8 tension has been with the research world for about a decade,” says Bodnick. “Apparently, in regions far from the center of the galaxy there should be no nonlinearity of the cosmological dynamics, since the dark matter is distributed approximately uniformly, and the baryonic matter should not dramatically affect the dynamics and the mass. Nevertheless, the statistics based on observations around the baryonic matter show an anomaly not expected”.\nS8 is a measure of changes in the density of matter in the universe: how uneven the distribution of matter is. Illustration of the structure of matter in the universe Equinox Graphics / Science Photo Library\nData, data, data The new study is divided for three articles : The first article describes the methods, the second presents the simulations and the third the findings, with an emphasis on S8 stretching. All three were published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in August last year.\nThe reasons for the existence of S8 pranks are shrouded in fog. Some claim that new physics, which deviates from the standard model, may explain the gap – but as of today we do not know what it is. In their work, the researchers compare and verify the simulations with experimental observations, for example Gravity drainage or Soniayev-Zeldowitz effect (Sunyaev-Zel’dovich), which is a distortion of the cosmic background radiation resulting from the scattering of photons (light particles) by hot electrons in galaxy clusters.\nAdding the baryonic matter requires much more computing power than usual. However, the researchers say they succeeded in their ambitious mission and examined the beginning of the universe through the glasses of the new imaging – the data from which amounts to several petabytes (trillion bytes). This is a huge amount of information, by any measure.\nOne of the simulations in the Flamingo series takes into account 300 billion particles, each of which has the mass of a small galaxy. All these galaxies, a bit like at the end of the movie “Men in Black”, exist inside a virtual cube whose length is ten billion light years. A light year is about nine trillion kilometers, so it is a huge size. All the simulations were written in a new code developed especially for them, which performs calculations in thirty thousand computer cores.\n“It’s important to take things in proportion,” Bodnik concludes. “This work is not very unique in its field, although it provides a novelty for us. With some degree of regret, we can update that the researchers have not yet been able to understand the reasons for the existence of S8 stretching, but this is another stop on the way there. In our quest to understand it, the universe does not run away Place”.\n#flamingo #sheds #light #beginning #universe",

Celui-ci a survécu en buvant de l'eau de pluie et a été secouru par deux pêcheurs. \"Miracle\" sur une autoroute américaine: un homme a été retrouvé alors qu'il était coincé dans son pick-up accidenté depuis près d'une semaine, ayant survécu en buvant de l'eau de pluie, avant que deux pécheurs ne remarquent la carcasse de son véhicule.\n\"J'ai touché son épaule, et il s'est retourné\" Deux hommes cherchaient mardi à taquiner le poisson dans une rivière de l'Etat américain de l'Indiana, près de Chicago, quand ils ont aperçu quelque chose de brillant à l'endroit où le cours d'eau passe sous l'Interstate 94, immense artère routière qui relie la région des Grands Lacs aux plaines du nord des Etats-Unis .\nEn s'approchant, ils remarquent un homme coincé derrière un airbag. \"Au moment où j'ai touché son épaule, il s'est retourné, il se réveillait. Il était vivant, et il était très heureux de nous voir\", a raconté lors d'une conférence de presse Mario Garcia, parti pêcher avec son gendre. \"Je n'avais jamais vu quelqu'un d'aussi soulagé.\"\nDans la foulée, ils appellent les secours, qui interviennent avec difficulté - des images diffusées par la police montrent le véhicule encastré dans un talus, entre la rivière et les bases du pont.\n\"Un miracle que ce monsieur soir vivant aujourd'hui\" L'homme de 27 ans a ensuite été héliporté vers un hôpital voisin, les secours faisant état de \"graves blessures\" et son pronostic vital étant engagé, a déclaré mardi soir lors d'une conférence de presse Glen Fifield, de la police d'Etat de l'Indiana.\n\"C'est un miracle que ce monsieur soit vivant aujourd'hui, et que ces deux messieurs se soient rendus dans ce ruisseau\", a-t-il ajouté. Pour une raison qui reste à déterminer, le pick-up s'est retrouvé parfaitement en dessous du pont de l'autoroute sur laquelle il roulait. Sa carcasse était quasiment impossible à voir depuis la chaussée, selon les autorités.\nLe miraculé a dit aux bons samaritains qui l'ont secouru qu'il était coincé là depuis mercredi dernier, près d'une semaine auparavant, et qu'il ne parvenait pas à atteindre son téléphone. \"Il a dit qu'il avait crié, hurlé, mais que personne ne l'entendait.\"\nEt s'il doit probablement son salut à des températures clémentes pendant le week-end de Noël cette année, le froid allait arriver dans la nuit de mardi à mercredi, et \"il n'allait sans doute pas tenir un jour de plus\", a encore déclaré Mario Garcia aux télévisions américaines.\nCN avec AFP Top Articles\nJapon: un Airbus de Japan Airlines en feu sur la piste de l'aéroport de Tokyo-Haneda à l'atterrissage",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA - December 28, 2023 - “Peace on Earth, good will toward men” is a catchphrase tossed about often during the holiday season, but it might sound like nothing more than wishful thinking as difficult conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and Gaza … even the land of Jesus’ birth (Galilee back then, now Israel) is engaged in unrest. And most of those in the U.S. probably aren’t even aware that civil conflicts are also ongoing currently in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria. Where to turn for signs of hope? The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God. Dr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org Most of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct quotes from the Real Reality, and this is one such quote pertaining to war: \"On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life's nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed 'planet Zero,' hanging in an 'impossible' position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people's internals … All the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?” And this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer: “Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.\" The question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace. Dr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org). An example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website: \"In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don't need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion 'can be fun' if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.\" Media Contact Company Name: Ascot Media Group, Inc.
