    "text": "By Katie Parkins ,\n6 hours ago While it's a snow day for many of Colorado's humans, both young and old, their furry friends are also enjoying the storm.\nMaybe as much as the children, \"This little Pomsky is loving the snowday!\" Gemma Hanekom said.\nRebecca Seib and her pup went for a walk Thursday morning in Lakewood's Union Ridge Park.\n\"Crazy snow amounts! Over 18+ inches!\" Seib said in her post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook group, noting she brought a tape measure with them on their stroll.\n\"The crazy thing is my dogs paws couldn't even reach the sidewalk!\" Seib said in her post.\nBut this pup didn't seem to mind, shoving its snoot straight into the snow.\nImpressive snow totals popping up in Florissant, Colorado in Teller County, just barely missing 2 feet when Claudia Ädams posted this photo of her trudging through the snow up to its belly.\nIn Castle Rock on Ridge Road, Michelle Rhea Karamooz sent us this video of letting her dogs outside.\nThe duo was just having so much fun, Karamooz asked Lily to lead her brother Luke back indoors. The pup came trotting in with a fresh layer of snow stuck to his back, seemingly without a care in the world.\nMichelle Rhea Karamooz.mp4 Looking at the table in her yard, Karamooz said she estimated there was about 16 inches of accumulation.\nIn Genesee Park, Erik Lassi snapped this photo of his pup waiting patiently to come back inside. Despite the inches of snow stacked up in the yard, this dog managed to only get a sprinkling on its back.\nErik Lassi Laura C. Keuhl told us she's seeing around 2 feet of snow in North Evergreen, which was just about as tall as their Australia Shepherd wading through the backyard. The pup got back to the door with a flare, bouncing through the approximately 24 inches.\nAustralia Shepherd in North Evergreen wades into snow Denver7's Angelika Albaladejo took this video of her dog Maya playing with her ball in the snow in Lakewood.\nDenver7's Angelika Albaladejo plays with her dog in the snow Dave Bader shared this video with Denver7 on Instagram of his pup traipsing through the snow in Highlands Ranch.

This 13-week old-puppy Maggi got to experience 18 inches of snow and counting in Highlands Ranch.\nJennifer Mravich Maggi's in good company.\nSnuffkin, Daisy Geasland's 11-month-old Springer Spaniel, wanted to help shovel the driveway with her paw-rents in southeast Aurora.\n\"The snow is one Snufkin deep,\" Geasland said.\nWhile this pup's name may be Autumn, she's looking like she's made for winter. Karoline told Denver7, Autumn was loving playing in the snow in their West Highlands backyard.\nKaroline You'd think it was summer though with the way Madison Mcfarland Elwell's Collie was laying out in the snow.\n\"She is loving this weather\" in Old Town Lafayette, Colorado, Elwell said\n\"Where's Waldo?\" If you look really closely, you'll be able to spot Josie Rhoads-Verbeek's dog sticking out from underneath 12 inches of snow in Arvada.\nJosie Rhoads-Verbeek This fluff ball is \"Up to snow good\" in Centennial, Colorado, Karen Dyroff said in the Denver7 Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook group.\nColorado snow totals? \"Dachshund size!\" Lynn Lynn said in a post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook group.\nWho needs the Metric System when you can measure in pups per square foot?\nThere's \"one Corgi of snow in Golden, CO!\" Cecillia Sanders said.\n\"Where you lead, I will follow...,\" Jennifer Deherrera's dogs told her, leaving a trail of tiny paw prints through Thursday's snow.\nJennifer Deherra Colorado's dogs (and their owners) are getting creative in the snow \"riding the storm out in Boulder,\" Jocasta Captures said.\nIn Elizabeth, Colorado, \"Meadow and Juniper give this storm up!!!\" Patti Yoensky said in her post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook page.\nBut it's not just the dogs taking in Thursday's delivery from Jack Frost.\nWe've got some Colorado cats venturing out in the snow.\n\"My other cat doesn’t want to go out in the snow as much..smart!

    "text": "Former President\nDonald Trump raised eyebrows Monday (Dec. 25) when he told a handful of people who he believes are “looking to destroy our once great USA” to “rot in hell” before wishing them a “merry Christmas.”\nThe 45th President of the United States posted his statement on Truth Social, the social media platform he founded in 2021 after he was permanently suspended from Jack Dorsey’s Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. The media giants alleged that Trump was using his platform to “incite violence.”\nNearly two years later, Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk,\nlifted Trump’s ban, allowing his more than 59,000 tweets to viewed by his now 87.4 million followers. However, although Trump’s suspension was lifted, the former president has chosen only to use Truth Social.\nRELATED:\n‘Trump Comes Up Short’—Former Trump Supporter Wayne Grudem Now Calls for Him To ‘Back Out Now’\nFacebook lifted its ban of Trump in January 2023. That page is run by the “Donald J. Trump for President” 2024 campaign staff.\nTruth Social has approximately 2 million active users, compared to Twitter, which is now called X and has over 525 million users. Facebook has 3.03 billion monthly active users.\nTrump’s Christmas message specifically mentioned President Joe Biden and special counsel Jack Smith.\n“Merry Christmas to all,” Trump wrote, “including Crooked\nJoe Biden’s\nRELATED:\nAs Trump Campaign Continues To Ramp up, So Does God-Talk\nThe GOP presidential favorite and professing Christian then mentioned world leaders, zeroing in on people he believes have set out to destroy America and wishing for them to spend an eternity in hell.\n“Included also are World Leaders,” Trump added, “both good and bad, but none of which are as evil and ‘sick’ as the THUGS we have inside our Country who, with their Open Borders, INFLATION, Afghanistan Surrender, Green New Scam, High Taxes, No Energy Independence, Woke Military, Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Iran, All Electric Car Lunacy, and so much more, are looking to destroy our once great USA.\n“\nMAY THEY ROT IN HELL,” Trump continued. “AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!”",

    "text": "Schneider Electric, the leader in energy management and digital automation, underscores the importance of a green approach to data centre design and operations to future-proof operations and lessen carbon emissions. This will make the industry more sustainable and resilient to growing demands. The company recently gathered data centre industry players to discuss today’s data landscape and challenges in an event called Power Up: Fuel Your Path For Success. Uptime Institute, an international research organisation on global data centres, estimated a 500 per cent growth in data generated from 2019-2025 all over the world. As its operations are energy-intensive, the data centre industry is estimated to account for 1 per cent of global electricity consumption. “Data centres have become integral to our rapidly growing internet economy. The need to transition to sustainable operations has become more pronounced,” said Carlos Leviste, Business Development and Marketing Director at Schneider Electric Philippines. He added that industries have previously leaned heavily on fuel alone to run their operations. As data centre facilities are energy-intensive, data centres play a pivotal role in sustainability. The most efficient way would be to shift to electricity and digital. However, there is a growing preference across industries for maximizing energy management systems and digital tools, which not only drive operational efficiency but also promote sustainability. Data centres, equipped with smarter operations, can optimise costs, speed, and capital to prepare them for future technological integrations and risk mitigation. Schneider Electric is at the forefront of this advancement with its extensive suite of digital solutions to improve the efficiency and sustainability of data centres. For instance, APC, Schneider Electric’s flagship brand, offer high-efficiency uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), cooling units, and monitoring systems to foresee any unwanted downtime within the data centres and pinpoint inefficiencies to their operations. In particular, the oil-free cooling centrifugal compressors with magnetic bearings chiller systems that Schneider Electric utilises allows data centres to consume power more efficiently and sustainably. Similarly, Schneider Electric provides renewable Power & Grid solutions that can help produce electricity sustainably to fuel data centre facilities’ increasing needs. “Through these solutions, data centre facilities can reduce operational costs in design and engineering, function using grid-compliant assets and software with reduced cybersecurity risks and ensure proactive maintenance of assets to maintain optimum uninterrupted performance,” said Sara El Fanidi, Power and Grid Sales Leader of Schneider Electric APAC. Furthering its commitment to sustainable digital transformation, Schneider Electric has also introduced new industry certifications within its EcoXpert™ Partner Program. These certifications are aimed at empowering partners to become trusted advisors on Data Center and Critical Infrastructure solutions, ensuring data centres are not only efficient and resilient but also sustainable. By harnessing the power of digital transformation and connected infrastructure, Schneider Electric is setting a new standard for data centres — one that prioritises sustainability, reliability, efficiency, and resilience in the face of rapidly changing demands.

    "text": "Galicia destaca, aunque no precisamente para bien –según como se mire–, en el uso de [Internet](/tags/internet/). A pesar de que el 92,5% de los gallegos de entre 16 y 74 años navegó por la red en los últimos tres meses, esta cifra está por debajo de la media nacional (95,8%) y muy lejos de comunidades como Madrid o Cataluña, donde la cifra supera el 97%. Y lo curioso es que Galicia también lidera el ranking de los \"menos enganchados\": solo el 86,9% de los gallegos usa Internet al menos cinco días a la semana, el porcentaje más bajo de todo el país junto a Asturias. ¿A qué se debe este fenómeno? La dispersión geográfica, el envejecimiento de la población y el menor desarrollo de infraestructuras tecnológicas en algunas áreas rurales pueden ser factores claves. Galicia sigue sin sucumbir del todo a la conexión constante, y aquí, la desconexión, al parecer, tiene su propio atractivo. Compras online: con un pie en el freno ¿Y cómo van los gallegos en cuanto al comercio online? Pues con algo de cautela. Solo el 53,6% de los gallegos realizó compras en Internet en los últimos tres meses, un porcentaje por debajo de la media estatal del 56,7%. Aunque aumenta ligeramente año tras año, Galicia se mantiene más tradicional en sus hábitos de consumo, y prefiere el contacto físico, sin renunciar del todo a pasear por el comercio de barrio. A nivel nacional, la moda encabeza las compras online: ropa, calzado y accesorios son los favoritos, seguidos de entradas para eventos y entregas de comida rápida. Sin embargo, en la comunidad gallega, esta tendencia de consumo virtual parece avanzar sin prisa, pero ojo, sin pausa. Los jóvenes gallegos, con menos móvil que el resto de España En un mundo cada vez más digitalizado, donde muchos niños y jóvenes están constantemente pegados a pantallas y bombardeados por información, Galicia destaca con una tendencia diferente: menos dependencia de los teléfonos móviles entre los más jóvenes. Con solo el 63,4% de los gallegos entre 10 y 15 años usando este dispositivo, la comunidad se sitúa entre las que menos temprano introduce a sus menores al entorno digital. Este panorama sugiere que los niños gallegos disfrutan de más tiempo para explorar otras formas de entretenimiento y aprendizaje. Es más probable encontrarlos en el parque, jugando cara a cara y conectando con otros niños, en lugar de mirar una pantalla. En Galicia, los estímulos naturales siguen teniendo su espacio frente al avance tecnológico, ofreciendo una infancia con menos pantallas y más interacción directa. Con lo cual, este dato podría verse de forma positiva. Más cara a cara, menos teletrabajo El teletrabajo, a pesar de su auge durante la pandemia, todavía no despega en Galicia al ritmo de otras comunidades como Madrid, donde casi un 27% de los empleados trabaja desde casa. En Galicia, el trabajo telemático es menos frecuente, reflejando un vínculo con el trabajo presencial que, por el momento, no cede. Es que, ¡menudo gusto ver a tus compañeros en la oficina! Conectividad en casa y banca online: puntos a favor Eso sí, no todo son datos bajos: el 95,1% de los hogares gallegos ya tiene [conexión](https://www.elprogreso.es/articulo/comarcas/80-concellos-lugo-conectado-fibra-optica-adamo/202407181425001773621.html) a Internet, cada vez más cerca de la media nacional, y ocho de cada diez gallegos usan la banca electrónica, superando la media estatal. Aunque Galicia tenga una relación algo distante con la conectividad diaria, la comunidad avanza en otros aspectos digitales, especialmente en la gestión financiera online. ¿Desconexión o equilibrio? Galicia se desmarca como una de las comunidades menos digitalizadas, pero con un perfil único que muestra que, en la era de la hiperconexión, no todos los caminos llevan a la pantalla.",
