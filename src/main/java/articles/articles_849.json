    "title": "New Tennessee law aims to help former inmates find new jobs | localmemphis.com",
    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Starting in just a few days, several new laws will be going into effect in Tennessee, and one is aiming to help former inmates find and keep a job after they get out of prison.\nThis law would essentially guarantee former inmates of felony crimes the documents and photo ID they need to get a job. While the law was finalized in May, legwork began before the pandemic, and it has been an especially personal crusade for one Memphian.\n“When I was incarcerated the final time, I was 28 years old,” said DeAndre Brown, who now works at the Shelby County Office of Re-Entry .\nDuring his last stint in jail, Brown decided to make a vow to help break the cycle of crime many others like him found themselves in, sometimes unknowingly.\n“I made a promise to the lawyer then that if he let me out, I would make sure that I did everything in my power to make sure other young men didn’t come into this situation,” said Brown.\nIn the year to come, Brown focused on helping those wanting a new start in life outside of prison during his work at the Office of Re-Entry. This effort eventually led to Brown to helping develop a new law set to go into effect in Tennessee Jan. 1.\nThe new law will require the Tennessee Department of Corrections to grant former inmates the documentation they need to find a job and get a photo ID if the inmate does not already have one. While in the House of Representatives, the bill was supported by Rep. G.A. Hardaway.\n“It’s towards putting that one key piece in place that can help in so many different ways,” said Hardaway.\nBrown said this law will help break down barriers former inmates face when they get out of jail.\n\"Social security cards, drivers licenses - you may have even had it going in, but in the process of being incarcerated, your property, sometimes it gets lost or they expire, so we wanted to make sure the individuals have a leg up when they get home by at least allowing them to have the social documentation necessary to begin the process,\" said Brown.\nLeaders hope this will help further the FOCUSED program at the Office of Re-Entry.\n“It assists individuals with making them job-ready, and then we focus them on the work to break the cycle website, and hopefully we can get them employed with Shelby County government,” said Brown.\nFOCUSED operates like a paid internship for participants, with a fast track to potential employment. Waco Boyd participated in FOCUSED, and now works alongside Brown at the Office of Re-Entry.\n\"I have four teenage boys that are watching me, and I just want to show them that the streets is not the way,” said Boyd. “I just want to show them that hard work does pay off.”\nState Representative Hardaway said re-entry job assistance is key to helping prevent recidivism, and potentially ending up back in jail. However, Hardaway says this is only the first step, and several more need to happen.\nRelated Articles Finally Free: Former inmates say holidays can be a joy and a stress reuniting with family New website offers job opportunities in Shelby County government for justice-impacted people DOJ announces expansion of program to Memphis to fight violent crime in the city",

    "title": "Travel: Booking error forces Manitoba couple to cancel Mexico trip | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Jared and Danielle Funk believed they would be enjoying themselves on the beach in Cancun Thursday but they're still here in Manitoba. The couple booked their trip through Sunwing Vacations two and a half months ago. However, just 24 hours before they were scheduled to depart, the company contacted them to say, there were issues with their booking. \"We got a call from them, saying there is no accessible transportation for you from the airport to the hotel,\" Jared said. \"And the other thing was, there was no accessible room booked for us.\" Jared is quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair for his mobility and having both accessible transportation and accommodations are a deal breaker for him. \"If you can't get through the door, it's not like you can remove the door to your room and give everybody access to it,\" Danielle said. “So it's very frustrating.\" The Funks said they checked in with Sunwing about a month ago to ensure their accessibility needs were taken care of and they say they were assured everything was fine. On Thursday, 24 hours before they were set to take off, a company representative called them to say there were issues. \"Our bags are packed, we're, you know, excited to go,\" Jared said. \"My wife and I both booked off work. We're ready to go enjoy Mexico. And they go, ‘Well there's nothing we can do for you.’\" The Funks said a representative suggested they book and pay for their own ride from the airport which they considered but after finding out the hotel had no accessible rooms available, they reluctantly cancelled their vacation. Gabor Lukacs, the head of passenger advocacy group Air Passenger Rights, said travellers are covered under Canadian law in Canadian airports, on the plane and in the airport of your destination. He said it is not that straightforward when it comes to a situation like the Funks. \"It's messy,\" he said, adding though many people purchase vacation packages, he has heard of many things going wrong. \"I would not touch a vacation package with a 10-foot pole personally.\" In an email to CTV News Winnipeg, Sunwing said, “We will share this with the appropriate teams for investigation. We will be in touch as we have more information.\" Winnipeg Top Stories CTVNews.ca Top Stories Gigantic new snake species discovered in Amazon rainforest Scientists working in the Amazon rainforest have discovered a new species of snake, rumoured to be the biggest in the world.

    "text": "By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued several warnings for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death.\nWalmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy.\nEarlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s small parts cylinder (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.”\nThe agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States.\nThe recall affects about 4,240 units. The CPSC said customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
