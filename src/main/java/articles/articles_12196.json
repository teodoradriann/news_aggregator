    "text": "机器搭载AI耳朵与大脑 听见设备故障求援信号\n在现代工业环境中，每当精密的机器发出异响，都像是重大故障前的预警：“有点不对劲了。”\n以往，设备故障往往须要人工检查，或在问题发生时才会被发现。如今，借助传感器和人工智能（AI），设备发出的每个“呼救”都能被记录分析，从而及时发现潜在故障。\nGroundup.ai创办人兼首席执行官林久禾看到这项技术的潜力，把它应用到更多领域。他利用声学AI为机器装上耳朵和大脑，通过预防性维护（predictive maintenance）避免故障发生，减少停机时间，让生产更加高效顺畅。\n现年36岁的林久禾曾从事加密货币挖矿。他在接受《联合早报》访问时说，这段经历让他获得关于设备维护的宝贵经验。\n他回忆道，矿机分布在世界各地，为了收益最大化，24小时满负荷运行。“这导致机械过热，设备频繁故障。而每当发生故障，都须人工抢修，工作量极大。”\n林久禾发现，矿机故障前有不少征兆，而声音是最准确的。凭这一灵感，他的团队开始研发相关技术，显著提升矿机效率。这一技术吸引大量客户，将矿机寄存在公司。\n不过，随着2018年下半年加密货币市场崩盘，林久禾的业务一度陷入困境。不过这让他意识到，预测故障的技术本身是更宝贵的资产。\n技术转型遇挑战 耐心说服“老安哥”共谱AI未来\n自2020年起，Groundup.ai开始专注于将声学AI应用于工业设备的故障预测。“这一技术应用非常广泛，须要高频运作重型机器的行业能从中受益。”\n在机器学习中，迁移学习（transfer learning）能将已在某个任务上训练好的模型，应用到另一个相关任务上。林久禾指出，通过这一方法，他能将AI技术运用于不同领域、不同种类的机械上。如今，他的客户遍及制造业、海事和陆路交通等行业。\n然而，转型并非一帆风顺。林久禾特别提到，向那些传统行业的“老一辈”工程师推广AI技术时，遇到不少阻力。\n“我们最初面对的挑战之一，就是如何让行业里的‘老安哥’接受AI。传统上，他们通过亲自‘望闻问切’来诊断设备故障，而现在我们要用人工智能替代他们的经验。”\n为了突破这一瓶颈，林久禾和团队花了许多功夫与他们沟通。“我们不是告诉这些工程师，‘你们的工作会被替代’，而是更多地去倾听他们的声音，理解他们的顾虑。”\n林久禾解释，许多工程师会担心，AI将让他们失业。林久禾没有回避这一点，而是耐心地告诉这些工程师，他们的宝贵经验是AI无法完全替代的，反而能训练AI，让判断更精准。\n他也说，通过和AI合作，传统工程师不仅可以扩展自己的工作范围，还能将自己的经验以另一种方式延续下去。\n“AI技术可以帮助他们像拥有一千只手一样，快速而精确地处理更多设备。工程师可以将更多的精力集中于更高价值的工作，而不必过于依赖传统的人工检查方式。”\n从基层员工入手 打破传统行业客户偏见\n不仅要说服害怕失业的工程师，也要说服传统行业的客户接受新技术。林久禾受访时回忆，他是如何令一名怀疑AI的客户对这项技术改观的。\n林久禾说，这名客户来自水泥行业，是一家大型企业的董事总经理。“最初，他坚信AI完全不适用于他的行业。他认为，AI只适合金融业和电子商务这类行业。水泥业这么传统，怎么可能用得上呢？”\n面对怀疑，林久禾并没有放弃，而是转变策略，决定从客户的基层员工入手，寻求突破。“知道这名老板不相信AI，我们开始从员工入手，展示AI如何让他们的工作变得更安全、更高效。”\n他说，在传统的维修工作中，员工经常要亲自接触机器，进行手动检查，而这通常很危险。“通过AI，我们能够在不接触机器的情况下，实时监控设备的健康状况，提前预警，避免很多高风险的操作。”\n通过这一策略，基层员工对AI的接纳度逐渐提高。这名水泥公司董事总经理也开始意识到，AI不仅能提高生产效率，还能大大降低企业的运营成本。\n“最终，我们帮助公司减少大量的第三方人工维修费用。以前，公司每年须要支付15万元给外部工程师，现在，通过我们的AI解决方案，他们的成本减至十分之一。”\n拓展中东印尼市场 迎接全球化机遇\nGroundup.ai的技术也吸引投资者目光。公司在2023年成功募集180万元，用于产品发展和国际扩展。林久禾说，这帮助公司开拓中东、印度尼西亚等海外市场，成为许多国际企业和工业巨头的合作伙伴。公司的传感器，已被安装到卡塔尔的火车站和多哈哈马德国际机场。\n林久禾注意到，近年来许多中东国家积极推动工业化发展，这带来大量设备运营和维护方面的需求。\n公司近期也预计锁定更多投资。林久禾表明这有助业务进一步“走出去”。他说：“未来三年，我们希望将我们的技术推广到欧洲、澳大利亚等地，并全面开拓这些市场。”\n三之三",

    "title": "What Richmond blames for 66,000 personal property tax bill mistakes",
    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. -- Personal property taxes are the second largest local revenue source for the City of Richmond, generating approximately 12% of the City's revenue. In May, CBS 6 reported that the City had wrongly assessed the value of thousands of motor vehicles. Now we know, based on an audit released on Dec. 5, Richmond made more than 66,000 billing mistakes. According to the audit, a system error was detected by the Finance Department upon review of taxpayers' personal inquiries about the increase in their personal property tax bill in 2023. The audit found the department did not have a process to capture variations in the assessment methods from year-to-year, did not have a quality assurance review process for assessments made by staff, a review process for VIN histories, or a control in place to review if or when the assessment of a vehicle is overridden by personnel in the tax office. A statement from a city spokesperson said the following: The City of Richmond sends out over 220,000 personal property bills. The due date for personal property taxes was amended from June 5, 2022 to August 5, 2022. However, due to technical issues arising from the legacy billing system, 66,000 accounts were assessed penalty and interest during the extended due date of August 5. These accounts have been identified and are being corrected. To date 41,000 have been corrected and the remainder will be corrected by March 31, 2024. The audit also said DMV data is not always accurate, noting sometimes mailing addressing in the Richmond area have Richmond as the City name, but the address is actually located outside city boundaries. There is no automated process in place to ensure the addresses provided by the DMV are within the confines of the city. The audit recommends a review of accounts where the owner's address is outside of the city, but the vehicle is listed as garaged within the city.",

    "text": "After Thursday's stunning show, northern lights may be visible again in Wisconsin tonight The northern lights [captivated skywatchers across the state](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2024/10/11/see-the-northern-lights-in-wisconsins-night-sky-thursday-night/75625 7/) Thursday night, and Wisconsinites should be able to catch another glimpse of the colors Friday night. Following an eruption of solar material earlier Tuesday, the [NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october) issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday through early Saturday. Watches at this level are very rare. Strong geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operation, NOAA says. With these conditions, northern lights could be seen as far south as Alabama and northern California. Thursday night's light show was so vibrant that it prompted NOAA to [issue a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october) for the [second time this year](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/severe-solar-storm-2024/73642315007/). According to the National Weather Service, cloudier skies Friday night might make viewing the northern lights more difficult than it was Thursday night. Here's what to know: When can I see the northern lights in Wisconsin? When the northern lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Outside variables, such as weather and the precise trajectory of the solar eruption, which can change during its 93-million-mile journey to Earth, could affect the reliability of the forecast. For the most up-to-date viewing forecast, you can use the [NOAA Aurora forecast tool](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast), which has a 30-minute forecast window. You can check the latest weather forecast via the [National Weather Service](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?textField1=43.0633&textField2=-87.9666). What causes the northern lights? Also known as aurora borealis, the northern lights are [a natural light display in Earth's sky](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/northern-lights-aurora-when-time/73638964007/) that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with [molecules and gases like oxygen and nitrogen](https://www.jsonline.com/story/graphics/2024/05/18/northern-lights-colors-explained/73731506007/), causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the [University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) website, which tracks the phenomenon. As auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that has fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time. Are northern lights becoming more common? This isn't the first time this year people throughout Wisconsin caught a glimpse of the northern lights. In May, a [powerful geomagnetic storm](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/severe-solar-storm-2024/73642315007/) unleashed [spectacular views of the northern lights](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/aurora-borealis-photos-northern-lights-seen-us-europe/73652013007/) in areas of the U.S. where auroras are seldom visible, [including here in Milwaukee](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/05/11/northern-lights-seen-in-milwaukee-wisconsin-last-night/73653382007/). As the [sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/northern-lights-solar-maximum-auroras/75449249007/) in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter northern-light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity.
