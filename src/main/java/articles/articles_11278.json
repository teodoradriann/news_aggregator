    "title": "Canada announces first immigration cut in years amid growing political pressure",
    "text": "Canada is set to reduce its immigration intake for the first time in years as the Liberal government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, attempts to regain political ground ahead of the next election. Immigration Minister Marc Miller announced on Thursday that from 2025 to 2027, the country will admit 1.1 million new permanent residents, a 21 per cent reduction compared to previous targets. This policy shift marks a significant departure from Canada's pandemic-era immigration strategy, which saw a loosening of restrictions to address labour shortages. In contrast, the new plan aims to \"pause population growth in the short term\" to ensure more \"well-managed and sustainable growth\" in the future. Under the new targets, Canada will welcome 395,000 new permanent residents in 2025, 380,000 in 2026, and 365,000 in 2027. These figures are down from the 485,000 planned for 2024. The number of temporary residents will also be reduced by 30,000 in 2025, bringing the total to 300,000. While the Trudeau government has long championed immigration as a key to Canada's economic growth, the policy change reflects mounting public concerns. Housing shortages, infrastructure strains, and social services under pressure have sparked debate over whether immigration is contributing to these issues. Recent polls show a growing number of Canadians believe the country is accepting too many newcomers, a shift that has fueled support for the opposition Conservatives. “We didn’t get the balance quite right,” Trudeau admitted, acknowledging the challenges posed by rapid population growth. “We see the pressures facing our country, and we must adapt our policies accordingly.” The revised immigration targets have sparked a backlash from advocates for migrant rights. Syed Hussan, spokesperson for the Migrant Rights Network Secretariat, criticised the cuts as \"one of the most egregious rollbacks of migrant rights in Canadian history.\" He warned that reducing permanent resident admissions would push more migrants into temporary or undocumented status, exposing them to exploitative working conditions. Canada’s decision to curtail immigration is projected to lead to a slight population decline of 0.2 per cent in 2025 and 2026, but the government anticipates a rebound in 2027 with a population increase of 0.8 per cent. The government argued that these adjustments would help provinces, territories, and stakeholders align their resources and capacities to better support incoming immigrants. As Canada prepares for a federal election, due no later than October 2025, the immigration debate is expected to remain a contentious issue, with the future of the country’s policies hanging in the balance.

    "text": "Antonia Hay has had surgery and kidney failure since being infected with the deadly bacteria\nA girl has been left fighting for her life after she caught a deadly strain of E. coli.\nAntonia Hay, 17, is believed to have caught STEC-HUS, caused by E. coli O157, from food at a Christmas market.\nThe aspiring actress, has spent most of the past two weeks in intensive care, only coming home temporarily on Christmas Day.\nShe has had multiple operations, including to remove part of her bowel, and a blood transfusion as kidney failure has meant she requires dialysis, and left her feeling her “dreams have been ripped away” from her because she cannot continue her performing arts course.\nJemima Hay, her older sister, said: “She is lucky to be alive and has continued to show amazing determination and strength throughout this time, despite the immense stress, pain and trauma – all combined with an extreme phobia of injections.”\nWhile the teenager is believed to have contracted E. coli from a Christmas market in November, it is not known what sort of food led to her catching it.\nAntonia has had to give up her performing arts course because of the infection\nShe is one of 30 confirmed cases of E. coli across England and Scotland since late July 2023, with one person having died.\nMost cases occurred in December, however, which sparked the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to issue a recall notice for four cheese products on Christmas Day.\nThe cheeses were Mrs Kirkham’s Mild and Creamy Lancashire, Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire, Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire and Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire, which were part of Christmas hampers.\nA further notice was issued on Wednesday by the FSA for the Waitrose artisan No.1 Kirkham’s Lancashire product, all of which are made by the same company.\nCheese may have been in hampers Mrs Kirkham’s, an award-winning cheesemaker from Lancashire, makes its product in Goosnargh and is the only place in the world to still make raw milk Lancashire cheese.\n“The cheeses are sometimes sold as a full block or served as individual portions and may have been provided as part of a hamper you’ve purchased or been gifted,” the FSA said.\n“In some cases it’s been sold as part of a charcutier grazing platter. It may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.”\nAlthough E. coli is often transmitted via contaminated food, the UK Health Security Agency says it “can also be spread by close contact with an infected person, as well as direct contact with an infected animal”.\nSteve Hay, Antonia’s father, believes it was caught from food at a local market in Great Missenden, Bucks.\n“To anyone who may have experienced food poisoning symptoms at any restaurant, establishment or any market stall in Great Missenden during the Christmas Market, particularly on or from 25 November, please can you PM me,” he wrote on Facebook.\n“My middle daughter is fighting for her life after a serious bacterial infection suspected from eating something around this time and we have strong theories, but just need to know if anyone else was affected with any level of stomach issues or illness.”\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

    "title": "PICS: Top Five Most Expensive Homes Sold In Ireland In 2023",
    "text": "Lately, it's become a new custom when wandering by a real estate office to stop and grab a daily dose of disbelief as you look through the modestly-sized houses selling for the price of small mansions.\nThis new tradition has become a great replacement for the classic scary movie, or murder-mystery thriller, to replace your annual source of shock therapy.\nToday's top videos\nHere we recap the five most expensive homes in Ireland that sold this year and - spoiler alert - not all of them are based in Dublin...\n1. Bushey Park House Bushey Park House. Pic: Ireland Sotheby’s International Realty Coming out on top is Bushey Park House in Enniskerry, Wicklow. This Georgian mansion owned by singer Chris de Burgh sold for an eye-watering €9.399 million.\nThe property was originally offered for €12.5 million when it entered the market in June 2019 before a fifth of the asking price was slashed to €9.85 million. The house, which is located over a kilometre outside of Enniskerry is located on a 27-acre plot of land, consisting of eight bedrooms, over 25,685sq ft.\nPic: Ireland Sotheby’s International Realty The singer purchased the property in 1996 and spent over seven years refurbishing his place which now includes a lift, a panic room, a restored set of stables and a guest cottage on the grounds, along with a tennis court, walled garden and leisure complex with an indoor pool.\n2. 71 Merrion Square With Merrion Square on the doorstep, this property certainly ticks the Location, Location, Location box! Pic: Getty Images Of course, it wasn't going to take long for Dublin to crop up on the list, and 71 Merrion Square sold for €9,246,550 in June.\nDermot Desmond, the well-known financier, was the owner of this Georgian property who purchased it in 2000 for an original €7 million. The lucky new owners can enjoy a renovated house, with Dermot having spent in the region of €5 million upgrading the property, according to the Irish Times.\nNumber 71's new owner is understood to be Glen Dimplex chairman, whose home is coincidentally fourth on this list.\n3. Paddock Wood @sherry_fitz Welcome to Paddock Wood, Killiney Hill Road, Killiney, Co. Dublin ✨ A spectacular curved and glass walled hillside sanctuary! Among many other things, the architectural masterpiece features superb sea views, infinity pool, and a custom built golf practice area 🌊⛳️🏡 #sherryfitz #irishproperty #realestate #dublin #architecture #panoramicview #seaview ♬ New Beginnings - ZydSounds Located in Killiney, Dublin, this contemporary mansion sold for €8.5m. Sold by Sherry FitzGerald, this mansion looks like one of the cliffside sprawlers found in LA rather than on Dublin's southside stretch.\nBased on 1.5 acres of manicured gardens, this property is glass-centric, with an infinity pool, and a six-hole golf putting green. Having sold in August, the original asking price is believed to have been €9.75m.\n4. Drumleck House We told you this one would be popping up again. Drumluck House located in Howth was sold by estate agent Gallagher Quigley for €7.5 million in October.\nPic: MyHome.ie The mansion located on the scenic cliffs of Howth has five bedrooms, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, an entertaining space, and Italian-esque style gardens.\nPic: MyHome.ie Having originally appeared on the market for an asking price of €10 million, it is understood the Glen Dimplex chairman's home has been bought by an Irish family.\n5. 24 The Burbidge The Burbidge property goes down in Irish property history as the most expensive apartment ever sold at a whopping €6,999,999.\nLansdowne Place, Ballsbridge Dublin 4. Pic: Lansdowneplace.ie The 3,454sq ft penthouse has been purchased by an Irish businessman and joins the ranks of Rod Stewart and Roy Keane as owners in the luxury building. On the seventh floor at Lansdowne Place, the penthouse consists of three bedrooms which all have ensuite bathrooms and walk-in wardrobes.\nLansdowne Place, Ballsbridge Dublin 4. Pic: Lansdowneplace.ie The penthouse's building also features a round-the-clock concierge service, a fitness suite, a morning lounge, and a formal meeting room which can double as a dining space for dinner parties.",

( KKTV /Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service.\nMichael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2.\nLaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it.\n“The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told KKTV . “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.”\nHe completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs.\nChris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring.\n“Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said.\nAs LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced.\n“Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 KKTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

(Yves Herman, Reuters)     Save Story Leer en español Read in English Estimated read time: 1-2 minutes\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nJohnson & Johnson paused the U.S. rollout of its Varipulse heart device after stroke reports. The pause follows four stroke events, affecting patients in the U.S. and Europe. NEW YORK — Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it temporarily paused the rollout of its Varipulse heart device in the United States as the company investigates four reported stroke events.\nThe Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, a database of medical device reports submitted to the FDA by manufacturers, shows a patient enrolled in a Varipulse study had a stroke shortly after treatment.\nIt adds that at least two other patients in Europe had similar complications.\nRivals Boston Scientific and Medtronic stock Wednesday with at least two analysts saying Johnson & Johnson's pause could be beneficial for the two companies.\n\"We think this delay should most significantly benefit (Boston's) Farapulse,\" JP Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note.\nJohnson & Johnson had also paused the international rollout last year and feedback from doctors for the device has been mixed, he added.\nVaripulse, which uses a pulsed-field ablation technique to treat certain abnormal heart rhythm conditions, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November.\nJohnson & Johnson said it had initiated the pause on Jan. 5, after completing more than 130 cases as part of the U.S. rollout. The company did not provide details on when it expects to resume the launch.\n\"We are working diligently to complete the investigation according to our medical safety processes and resume the U.S. External Evaluation,\" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement.\nAn external evaluation is a limited rollout intended to collect doctors' feedback on new technology before a broader full release.\nThe company added that commercial activity and cases outside the United States would not be affected by the pause.\nGlobally, the Varipulse rollout has been successful, with over 3,000 commercial cases completed, Johnson & Johnson said.\nContributing: Puyaan Singh and Sriparna Roy\n× The Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.
