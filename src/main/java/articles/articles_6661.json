    "text": "Crews successfully rescued 31 people who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in L.A.’s Wilmington neighborhood Wednesday night. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the industrial tunnel on the 1700 block of South Figueroa Street shortly before 8 p.m. The tunnel was filled with workers at the time, who were located 300-400 feet beneath the surface and around six miles away from the tunnel’s only access point. More than 100 LAFD responders arrived at the scene, including Urban Search and Rescue team members who were specially trained and equipped to handle confined space tunnel rescues. Some workers who were separated inside the tunnel had to climb over a 12-to 15-foot pile of loose soil to escape and join their colleagues on the other side. Sky5 footage captured the rescue efforts as they were hoisted to the surface from the tunnel, which had an 18-foot diameter. The workers stepped inside a metal compartment that was lifted by a crane to the surface. Around 9:20 p.m., all 31 workers were safely extricated and accounted for. Many were seen hugging each other. No injuries were reported as paramedics evaluated each person at the scene. The wastewater tunnel site is part of the L.A. County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, which spans seven miles and is being “constructed to protect local waterways by addressing aging infrastructure,” according to the project’s website. L.A. Mayor Karen Bass also arrived at the scene and released a statement on X, saying, “I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.’s true heroes.” Details are limited. The circumstances that caused the tunnel to collapse remain under investigation. This developing story will be updated.

    "text": "Meta says it sniffed out six new covert influence operations on its platforms in the second quarter of 2024 and expects more ahead of November’s U.S. elections.\nWhat You Need To Know Meta says it sniffed out six new covert influence operations on its platforms in the second quarter of 2024 and expects more ahead of November’s U.S. elections\nIn its quarterly adversarial threat report, released Thursday, the social media giant said the six campaigns originated in Russia, Vietnam and the U.S.\nRussia continues to be the top source of covert influence operations targeting people globally, followed by Iran and China, Meta said\nIn the U.S., Meta took down 96 Facebook accounts, 16 pages and 12 groups as well as three Instagram accounts it linked to a network posing as a fake political advocacy group In its quarterly adversarial threat report , released Thursday, the social media giant said the six campaigns originated in Russia, Vietnam and the U.S. Meta said it removed many of them before they were able to build up large audiences.\nNot all targeted the U.S.\nRussia continues to be the top source of covert influence operations targeting people globally, followed by Iran and China, Meta said.\nMuch of the Russian efforts appeared focused on undermining support for Ukraine and the countries in the region, including Georgia and Moldova, according to the report. Meta said that in the months leading up to the U.S. elections, it expects Russia-based operations to promote commentary and candidates who oppose aid to Kyiv and criticize those who advocate for boosting Ukraine’s military.\n“This could take the shape of blaming economic hardships in the US on providing financial help to Ukraine, painting Ukraine’s government as unreliable, or amplifying voices expressing pro-Russia views on the war and its prospects,” the report said.\nOne Russian operation targeted English- and French-speaking audiences around the world by, in part, creating a network of fictitious news websites, Meta said. The operators would mix articles promoting its objectives with news about entertainment, celebrity gossip and other topics.\nThe nonpolitical stories were likely AI-generated summaries of articles from established news organizations, the report said. The campaign also used AI-generated newsreaders in YouTube videos that focused on criticizing President Joe Biden and Democrats for providing aid to Ukraine, Facebook’s parent company said.\nMeta said it removed 12 accounts, 32 pages and five groups on Facebook and three accounts on Instagram tied to the operation.\nIn the U.S., Meta took down 96 Facebook accounts, 16 pages and 12 groups as well as three Instagram accounts it linked to a network posing as a fake political advocacy group. “Patriots Run Project” called on “real conservatives” to run for office in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, according to the report.\nThe operation used accounts belonging to fictitious people, Meta said.\nThe Vietnam-based operation primarily focused on criticizing Qatar and primarily targeted Lebanon, the U.S., the United Kingdom and France, Meta said. The campaign targeted multiple apps, ran websites and placed ads on billboards in the U.S. and Lebanon, according to the company.\nMeta also provided an update on Doppelganger, a Russian operation it first publicly identified in 2022, which uses a large network of websites to spoof legitimate ones.\nThe report said Doppelganger remains the most persistent Russian-based campaign. Meta said it has seen “notable shifts” in its tactics. For example, to avoid detection, operators are increasingly using nonpolitical posts and ads, including about innocuous topics such as food and health, but the links then take people to articles about the Russia-Ukraine war or geopolitics on spoofed websites.\nAfter a pause, Doppelganger operators have resumed their campaign sharing links to their fake content — although at a much lower rate — potentially influencing opinion-makers and politicians, Meta said.\nSince May alone, Meta has removed more than 5,000 accounts and pages it traced back to Doppelganger.\nThe social media company said generative artificial intelligence tactics have provided “only incremental productivity and content-generation gains to threat actors,” but added that the industry’s defense strategies against AI misuse have largely been effective.\nMeta said it shares its information about foreign interference threats with other tech platforms, researchers and governments.\nMicrosoft last week said Iran is accelerating online activity that appears intended to influence the U.S. presidential election. On Saturday, former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, said Microsoft informed his campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites. The FBI said Monday it is investigating the incident.\nMeta’s report did not have any information about new campaigns originating from Iran.\n-",

    "title": "Preço de alimentos e juros contribuíram para frear inflação em 2023, dizem economistas",
    "text": "De acordo com os especialistas, a tendência é de que a inflação continue a cair (Tânia Rêgo/ Agência Brasil) O comportamento dos preços dos alimentos e a política monetária, que impôs juros altos na economia em 2023, foram fatores que ajudaram a inflação ficar controlada neste ano que termina. A avaliação é de especialistas ouvidos pela Agência Brasil, nesta quinta-feira (28), quando foram divulgados dois índices de inflação. O Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo 15 (IPCA-15), tido como a prévia da inflação oficial do país, fechou 2023 em 4,72%, o menor resultado dos últimos três anos. O dado é do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Calculado pela Fundação Getulio Vargas, o Índice Geral de Preços - Mercado (IGP-M) apresentou deflação no ano, ou seja, a média dos preços ficou em queda de 3,18%. O resultado marca uma inflexão do índice, que chegou a fechar 2020 em 23,14%. O ano de 2021 também ficou na casa de dois dígitos, 17,78%. Em 2022, sinalizou desaceleração, terminando em 5,45%. Fatores Para o economista e professor do Ibmec, Gilberto Braga, os números mostram acertos da política macroeconômica do governo e do Comitê de Política Monetária (Copom) do Banco Central (BC), responsável por ditar a taxa básica de juros da economia, a Selic. Ao longo do ano, a Selic foi mantida em patamares altos, como forma de desestimular a economia e, consequentemente, combater a inflação. O ano começou com taxa de 13,75% e, depois de quatro cortes seguidos no segundo semestre, encerra 2023 em 11,75% Braga destaca que há grupos de preços que ainda pressionam os índices. “Principalmente dos aluguéis, que vêm subindo mais do que a inflação média da economia”. Mas ressalta que “o preço dos alimentos, de uma forma geral, vêm caindo, o que vem contrabalançar de maneira positiva as pressões de aumento”. O professor do Ibmec espera manutenção da tendência para o próximo ano. “Para 2024, esse comportamento dos preços deve permanecer com a inflação tendendo a cair”. No entanto, Gilberto Braga aponta que há riscos vindo de fora do Brasil. “Pressão externa, sobretudo, por conta dos conflitos bélicos da Rússia com a Ucrânia e do Oriente Médio [ofensiva israelense na Faixa de Gaza], que influenciam os preços do petróleo, dos seguros e do livre fluxo de comércio internacional”, descreve. “A expectativa, apesar dessas ameaças, é bastante positiva para 2024”, completa. Commodities O pesquisador André Braz, do Instituto Brasileiro de Economia da Fundação Getulio Vargas (Ibre/FGV), aponta que um elemento que ajudou a moldar a inflação de 2023 foram os preços das commodities (matérias-primas básicas negociadas com preços internacionais) agrícolas e minerais. “Na parte agrícola, soja, milho e trigo, que são matéria-prima para vários outros alimentos, tiveram quedas muito fortes do preço ao produtor”. A soja, por exemplo, caiu 21,92%. No caso do milho, o recuo foi ainda maior, 30,02%. Braz explica que o comportamento do IGP-M representa uma “devolução” do choque inflacionário causado pela pandemia entre 2020 e 2022. “Dado as safras, que foram muito boas tanto no Brasil quanto em outros países produtores de grãos, a gente teve essa queda de preços muito grande. Então ajudou a compensar um pouco aquela fase de aumentos agudos”, explica. Apesar de o IGP-M divulgado nesta quinta-feira ser o menor já registrado para um ano fechado (-3,18%), Braz observa que o índice mostra uma tendência de aceleração. Em julho, o acumulado de queda em 12 meses era 7,72%. “Está acelerando, está ficando cada vez mais próximo de zero e vai migrar para um terreno positivo. Número negativo é algo incomum para o IGP-M porque, em condições normais, a trajetória desses preços é de alta”, contextualiza. Em dezembro o índice mensal ficou em 0,74%. IPCA Sobre o IPCA, Braz sinaliza que o resultado de 0,40% de dezembro ficou acima do esperado. A causa foi a concentração no mês de reajustes de preços controlados. “Vimos aumento de [taxa de] água e esgoto, energia, ônibus, trem e metrô em várias cidades do país”, lista. Ainda especificamente para o mês de dezembro, o economista da FGV interpreta que houve surpresa no preço de alguns alimentos, especialmente os de características sazonais. “Não foi um aumento generalizado, foi um aumento sazonal, produtos que normalmente têm uma oferta menor no verão, cuja oferta é prejudicada pelo clima, como produtos de feira livre. Por exemplo, hortaliças, legumes e frutas vieram inflados em função desse clima mais hostil”. Outra influência foi a alimentação fora de casa. “Nesse período de festas e de férias, as famílias costumam comer em restaurantes, lanchonetes, então os preços do menu normalmente sobem pela demanda”. Apesar dessa sinalização em dezembro, Braz salienta que, ao longo do ano, o preço dos alimentos teve um comportamento positivo para a economia brasileira, contribuindo para que a inflação oficial ficasse abaixo do esperado no início do ano, quando o mercado estimava o IPCA perto de 5,5%. O IPCA-15 mostrou que o grupo alimentos e bebidas subiu 0,83% em 2023. “É muito pouco frente a uma inflação média de 4,72%. Em termos reais, a alimentação não subiu de preço. Isso foi bom porque a alimentação compromete mais o orçamento de famílias de menor renda e, por conta disso, você tem espaço para que essas famílias consumam outras coisas \", diz. O IPCA fechado do mês de dezembro e do ano 2023 será divulgado no dia 11 de janeiro. Braz estima que o número seja perto de 4,45%. Se concretizado esse patamar, estaria dentro da meta do Banco Central, 3,25%, com intervalo de tolerância de 1,5 ponto percentual para cima ou para baixo, ou seja, o limite superior é de 4,75%. Para 2024 Já para o ano que vem, assim como Gilberto Braga, do Ibmec, que tem uma visão otimista, Braz espera um IPCA fechando 2024 por volta de 4%. No entanto, também enxerga desafios, como a guerra entre Rússia e Ucrânia e a ofensiva israelense contra o Hamas. André Braz acrescenta ainda outro fator de preocupação: o El Niño, fenômeno climático que modifica a temperatura das águas do oceano pacífico e impacta safras em diversas regiões do planeta. “Da mesma forma que vai afetar os preços ao produtor no IGP-M, vai afetar os preços ao consumidor também, é um repasse. Isso pode ser o desafio para o ano que vem”. No cenário interno, Braz cita que a política fiscal do governo, ou seja, o montante de gastos públicos, pode intervir no comportamento da inflação, caso haja dúvidas de o governo não cumprir a meta orçamentária. O ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, diz buscar déficit zero em 2024. “Se essa meta fica ameaçada, pode haver uma desvalorização do câmbio [frente ao dólar], e essa desvalorização causa inflação porque a gente passa a importar as coisas a um preço maior”, explica. Juros O economista do Ibre avalia que a política de juros do BC cumpriu, em 2023, o papel de debelar a inflação. Mas ressalta que a Selic em 11,75% ainda é muito alta, o que a torna um desafio para o crescimento do país, geração de emprego e renda. Mesmo com os desafios citados, Braz acredita que a inflação seguirá uma trajetória controlada o suficiente para permitir mais quedas na taxa básica de juros. “Acho que o BC vai ter condições de continuar cortando [a taxa] ainda que existam esses desafios no radar. É provável que a Selic termine o ano que vem, quem sabe, em torno de 9%”, acredita. Leia mais",

Dans une commune de 1 000 habitants située dans le Nord, la rivière voisine a déferlé, gorgée de pluie. \"Je ne sais même pas par où commencer\", se désole une sinistrée qui vient de voir dix ans d’économies pour réaliser une rénovation complète de sa maison englouties.

Their Champions League adventure will end before the group stage.\nParis is falling from above. After reaching at least the semi-finals of the last six editions, Paris Saint-Germain were eliminated in the second preliminary round of the Women’s Champions League by losing 2-1 in against Juventus Turin on Thursday at the PSG Campus in Poissy. The Parisiennes had already been beaten in the first leg (3-1).\nIt is a setback for the women’s division and its stars, especially the French internationals Elisa De Almeida, Gridge Mbock, Sakina Karchaoui, Grace Geyoro and Marie-Antoinette Katoto. Fabrice Abriel’s players, who lost their first period, were caught cold at the start of the game by a goal from Sofia Cantore (3rd).\nMore enterprising after the break, they equalized with the penalty from the Dutch Romee Leuchter (54th sp), but Barbara Bonensea gave the advantage back to the Turines (72nd).\nFrance will only have Lyon, the 2023 finalist and record holder for victories with 8 trophies, as a representative in C1 this season.\n2024-09-26 19:50:51\n#Champions #League #beaten #Juventus #PSG #eliminated",

    "text": "Maduro se reunió con la cúpula militar venezolana\nEl presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, dijo este jueves que ordenó “la activación de una acción conjunta defensiva de la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana” frente a las costas del Esequibo, región que su país se disputa con la vecina Guyana.\nLa noticia se conoce pocos días después de que el gobierno británico anunciara que enviará un barco de guerra a Guyana en un gesto de apoyo diplomático y militar a su antigua colonia.\nEn una reunión con el alto mando militar transmitida por la televisión estatal, Maduro aseguró que el envío del patrullero británico HMS Trent supone una “ruptura” del espíritu del acuerdo que alcanzó con el presidente guyanés, Irfan Ali, para no usar la fuerza en la resolución de las diferencias entre ambos países en la reunión que ambos líderes mantuvieron en San Vicente y las Granadinas el pasado 14 de diciembre.\nMaduro dijo que el despliegue del buque británico “es prácticamente una amenaza militar de Londres contra nuestro país”.\nAñadió que ambas partes acordaron evitar la presencia de “fuerzas militares extra regionales en el Caribe” y concluyó que “esto es una ruptura de los acuerdos”.\nEl presidente venezolano no dio detalles de en qué consistirá la acción militar que ha ordenado, pero algunos de los mandos militares que participaron en la reunión televisada indicaron que había 5.600 efectivos listos para el operativo.\nMaduro se reunió con el presidente guyanés, Irfan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre.\nEl Esequibo y la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana La acción militar anunciada por Maduro supone el último episodio del litigio entre Venezuela y Guyana por la región del Esequibo, un territorio de unos 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados, la mayoría de selva impenetrable que Caracas reclama como suyos desde que en 1899 un laudo internacional dictaminara que pertenecía a Reino Unido, entonces la potencia colonial que poseía lo que luego fue la Guyana independiente.\nEl contencioso se ha venido arrastrando con diferente intensidad desde entonces y se ha agravado en los últimos años, después de que se descubrieran en la zona importantes yacimientos de crudo y gas, y el gobierno guyanés concediera licencias para su explotación a la energética estadounidense ExxonMobil.\nEl asunto está en manos de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, cuya autoridad sobre el caso Venezuela no reconoce.\nEl pasado 4 de diciembre el gobierno venezolano celebró un referéndum en que la mayoría de votantes se mostraron a favor de incorporar el Esequibo como un nuevo estado de la República Bolivariana.\nEn un intento por rebajar la tensión, Maduro se vio el 14 de diciembre con su homólogo guyanés en un encuentro facilitado por la diplomacia brasileña y ambos acordaron rebajar la tensión y descartaron el uso de la fuerza.\nPero la entrada en escena del gobierno británico y el envío de un buque militar a la zona ha provocado la reacción de Venezuela\nCasi en simultáneo con la aparición televisiva de Maduro, la Cancillería venezolana afirmó en un comunicado que Caracas se “reserva todas las acciones, en el marco de la Constitución y el derecho internacional, para defender su integridad marítima y territorial”.\nEl patrullero HMS Trent, que Londres enviará al Caribe en medio de las tensiones entre Venezuela y Guyana.\nEl buque británico El Ministerio de Defensa británico confirmó el pasado fin de semana que el buque HMS Trent participará en ejercicios conjuntos con Guyana después de la Navidad.\nGuyana, un miembro de la Mancomunidad Británica, es el único país de habla inglesa en Sudamérica.\nEl HMS Trent cuenta con 65 tripulantes, una velocidad máxima de 24 nudos y un alcance de 5.000 millas náuticas.\nEl barco está armado con cañones de 30 mm y un contingente de cadetes de la Marina Real. También puede desplegar helicópteros tipo Merlin y aeronaves no tripuladas.\nEl HMS Trent zarpó de su puerto base en Gibraltar a comienzos de diciembre y actualmente se encuentra atracado en Bridgetown, la capital de Barbados, durante la Navidad.\nSe anticipa que el barco de guerra eche ancla frente a la capital de Guyana, Georgetown, y realice visitas, actividades conjuntas y entrenamiento con la marina de ese país y otros aliados. No puede atracar en el puerto por que este no es suficientemente profundo.\nEl ministro de Defensa de Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino, se pronunció el domingo sobre el anuncio a través de la red social X (antes Twitter):\n“¿Un buque de guerra en aguas por delimitar? ¿Y entonces? ¿Y el compromiso con la buena vecindad y la convivencia pacífica? ¿Y el acuerdo de no amenazarse y utilizar la fuerza mutuamente en ninguna circunstancia?\nЎSeguimos alertas ante estas provocaciones que ponen en riesgo la paz y la estabilidad del Caribe y nuestra América!”, señaló el funcionario.\nLínea gris\nRecuerda que puedes recibir notificaciones de BBC News Mundo.
