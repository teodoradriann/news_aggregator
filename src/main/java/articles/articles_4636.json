    "text": "Updates to FEMA Individual Assistance Programs Better Assist People with Disabilities FRANKFORT, Ky. – Earlier this year, FEMA announced updates to disaster assistance available during a federal declaration. These changes provide disaster support by increasing accessibility and eligibility for affected people, families and communities.\nSerious Needs Assistance This form of assistance covers important items like water, food, first aid, breastfeeding supplies, infant formula, diapers, personal hygiene items, fuel for transportation or other emergency supplies for eligible households. It is available in all disasters declared for Individual Assistance, after March 16, 2024, including Kentucky disaster 4782. It is available to eligible survivors who apply within the first 30 days after the Kentucky disaster was declared, which was May 22, 2024.\nTo qualify for SNA, you must be displaced, need shelter or have other emergency costs due to the disaster on your application. SNA also requires an inspection to confirm eligibility before funds are provided to applicants.\nPeople with Disabilities : This will help those who face greater health risks when access to disability-related supplies is delayed.\nDisplacement Assistance Eligible Kentuckians with immediate housing needs who cannot return to their homes may receive up-front funds to assist with housing. Funds could help pay for expenses while an individual looks for a rental option.\nDisplacement Assistance requires an inspection to confirm eligibility before funds are provided to applicants.\nPeople with Disabilities : This immediate short-term funding can also help pay for accessible accommodations, like Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) housing.\nHabitability Criteria FEMA simplified its definition of “habitability” to include repairs to homes with previous damage that were made worse by the disaster.\nPeople with Disabilities: This will help applicants with medical or health-related needs be able to repair their home even if it was in bad condition before the disaster.\nAccessibility Improvements Kentuckians with disabilities may use FEMA funding to make some accessibility improvements to homes damaged by a federally declared disaster.\nPeople with Disabilities: People with disabilities can make their home more accessible than it was pre-disaster with specific items, such as wheelchair ramps, grab bars, and paved pathways, and it will not count against the federal Housing Assistance maximum.\nTemporary Housing Assistance Applications FEMA is lowering verification requirements for applicants who need to extend their stay in a temporary housing solution.\nPeople with Disabilities : This lessens the documentation needed for people with disabilities who need more help paying for a place to stay.\nStreamlined DisasterAssistance.gov Website Applying for disaster assistance is now faster with the updated DisasterAssistance.gov website. The online application is easier to use.\nPeople with Disabilities: People with disabilities can now access a site that is more visual, easier to navigate and more accessible for those who use assistive technologies.\nFor the latest information on Kentucky’s recovery from the April 2 severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, landslides and mudslides, please visit fema.gov/disaster/4782 .

    "text": "ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA (6 December 2024) — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a senior secured 45.7 billion Mongolian togrog (equivalent to $13.5 million) loan with Orchlon School and Kindergarten Complex LLC to support Mongolia’s first internationally certified green campus.\nThe financing will support the construction of a new 4-floor new school annex that incorporates climate mitigation and adaptation features, and includes modern facilities such as laboratories for science, arts, and engineering courses, as well as indoor multipurpose halls for sports. The campus aims to be certified under the internationally recognized Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) program, targeting at least 20% savings in energy, water, and embodied energy in materials.\n“This project marks ADB's first private sector intervention in Mongolia's education sector and underscores ADB's commitment to fostering inclusive and sustainable development in the country,” said ADB Director General for Private Sector Operations Suzanne Gaboury. \"By supporting the country’s first green campus, we are enhancing educational infrastructure while promoting environmental sustainability and resilience.\"\nMongolia is among the countries most impacted by climate change. The natural hazards caused by climate trends have increased the risk of absenteeism and dropouts, which could lead to reduced access to education, lower attendance rates, and potentially poorer learning outcomes. Green buildings are still relatively new in Mongolia.\n\"We are thrilled to partner with ADB on this groundbreaking project,\" said Orchlon School Principal and Founder Batmunkh Dashdeleg. \"This expansion will allow us to provide more students with high-quality, bilingual education that preserves and promotes Mongolian culture, while also setting a benchmark for green building practices in Mongolia.\"\nEstablished in 2001, Orchlon is the largest private K-12 institution in Mongolia. It is the only Mongolian school that provides a dual curriculum from preschool to grade 12, comprising the Mongolian National Secondary Education curriculum and the Cambridge International curriculum. With nearly 2,000 students and a strong focus on academic excellence and holistic development, Orchlon has received numerous accolades and continues to lead in educational innovation.\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 69 members—49 from the region.",

    "text": "La Torre del Arte, un edificio de oficinas, buscará disponer de [energía renovable](https://peru21.pe/noticias/energia-renovable/) en San Borja. Este proyecto consiste en un sistema de 53 paneles solares que marcará un precedente en el uso de energías alternativas en edificaciones corporativas. Con una generación anual estimada de 40,090.53 kWh, el proyecto demuestra el potencial de la energía solar en el Perú. La implementación de este sistema permitirá un ahorro significativo en emisiones de CO2, estimado en 8.57 toneladas al año, equivalente al consumo energético de 25 viviendas. MIRA: [Universitarios crean ‘repelente electrónico’ con energía solar contra mosquitos del dengue] Esto también equivale a una eficiencia y conservación equivalente al que generaría el consumo de 875 galones de gasolina y a plantar 129 árboles durante 10 años. La energía generada por los paneles solares equivale al consumo de 25 residencias en Lima o por 193 residencias en zonas rurales. “En Urbanova, estamos profundamente comprometidos con la sostenibilidad en nuestras edificaciones. Nuestra visión de futuro implica no solo diseñar y construir espacios que mejoren la calidad de vida de quienes los habitan sino también asegurar que estos contribuyan positivamente al bienestar de la comunidad y al medio ambiente. Por ello, cada uno de nuestros proyectos es una muestra de innovación que vienen siendo respaldados por certificaciones de nivel internacional”, señaló Giacomo Sissa, CEO de Urbanova. ¿Cómo funcionará la energía solar en el edificio? El sistema, con una capacidad instalada de 31.8 kWp y una potencia de salida máxima de 25 kW, se compone de paneles solares de 600Wp dispuestos en la azotea del edificio. Estos módulos, montados sobre estructuras de aluminio especialmente diseñadas para maximizar la captación solar, están conectados a un inversor de 25 kW, lo que facilita la conversión de energía solar en electricidad utilizable dentro del edificio. “Con este proyecto, Equans fortalece y reafirma su compromiso de seguir impulsando la transición energética en el Perú, contribuyendo a la mitigación de los efectos del cambio climático y aportando a la estrategia de sostenibilidad de nuestros clientes. Junto a Urbanova, estamos creando un legado positivo, generando un precedente en la propuesta de edificaciones sostenibles en el país”, señaló, Omar Lam, CEO Equans Perú. - Perú21 ePaper, [ingresa aquí](https://epaper.peru21.pe/)y pruébalo gratis.",

    "text": "La participación de Catalina Palacios en el certamen Miss Universo Chile sigue generando controversia. Esta vez, fue Daniela Aránguiz quien alzó la voz con una tajante crítica en el programa de TV+ “Sígueme”, donde cuestionó abiertamente la postulación de la ex “Mekano”.\nPalacios, quien sorprendió al anunciar su participación a los 45 años, desató múltiples reacciones tanto en redes como en la televisión. Mientras algunos la celebran por desafiar estereotipos de edad, otros, como Aránguiz, consideran que el espacio debe reservarse para mujeres más jóvenes.\n“Es hermosa, pero este concurso no es para nosotras”\nEn medio de la conversación en el panel, la conductora Julia Vial expresó su admiración por la exanimadora, destacando su buen estado físico y carisma. “Está en su mejor momento, guapísima. No representa 45 años”, dijo.\nSin embargo, Aránguiz fue categórica al responder: “Ya, Julia, por favor, hablemos en serio. Catalina Palacios es una mujer hermosa, siempre lo ha sido… pero este concurso no es para mujeres que ya somos mamás y que tenemos cuarenta y tantos”.\nLa panelista insistió en que es momento de ceder espacio a las nuevas generaciones. “Las niñas de veinte y tantos están en otra etapa. Nosotras tenemos otras prioridades. Catalina debería volver a la animación, lo hacía espectacular”, añadió.\n“Hay que colgar el colaless”\nCon su estilo directo, Daniela cerró su comentario con una frase que rápidamente se viralizó: “Ya pasó, hay que colgar el colaless”, aludiendo a que es tiempo de dejar atrás ciertos escenarios como los concursos de belleza.\nA pesar de la crítica, Aránguiz reconoció la trayectoria de Palacios y su talento en la conducción televisiva, sugiriendo que ese sería el camino ideal para su regreso a la pantalla.\nLa candidatura de Catalina Palacios al Miss Universo Chile 2025 continúa siendo uno de los temas más comentados del espectáculo nacional, generando debate sobre edad, inclusión y reinvención en la industria del entretenimiento.",
