The event, to be organised in coordination with the Can Tho University, will focus on industrialisation and modernisation as a driver for sustainable development in the region. It aims to connect domestic and international stakeholders to share insights and propose measures for developing key areas of the Mekong Delta, support building strategies and policies for the region’s sustainable development with a vision towards 2045, and enhance cooperation among relevant sides to create and implement programmes and projects helping with scientific - technological, socio-economic, and environmental development. The SDMD 2024 is expected to gather around 500 participants, including government officials, leaders from Mekong Delta localities and Ho Chi Minh City, experts, scientists, representatives from universities and associations, as well as international guests from Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Belgium, Denmark, and the US. Discussions will focus on advancing industrialisation, modernisation, and sustainable development in the region. Experts will present research and analyses on current challenges and potential solutions. The forum will also foster collaboration through the signing of agreements between the 13 Mekong Delta localities, Can Tho University and partners, as well as memoranda of understanding between local governments and businesses. An exhibition will showcase the region’s industrialisation and modernisationi achievements, including logistics hubs and products of the One Commune One Product (OCOP) programme. Participants will also tour industrial parks in Can Tho. The SDMD 2024 is part of a broader initiative called the SDMD 2045 that was launched in 2022 by the Government to support sustainable development in the Mekong Delta through 2045./.",

    "title": "How I make my financial life work as a single mum by choice",
    "text": "About three years ago, I became a single parent. It wasn't something I'd set out to do.\nLike many women, I pictured raising children with a partner. But after several failed relationships in my early 20s, I realised that maybe it wasn't going to happen for me the usual way.\nI had always been quite independent, so I thought, \"What if I could just do it on my own?\"\nThe more I investigated it, the more I realised that was what I wanted to do.\nThe hardest (and best) decision of my life\nBecoming a single mum by choice (SMBC) was one of the hardest yet best decisions I've ever made.\nThe early months were a mess of sleepless nights, self-doubt, and constant worry.\nI was on my own — and while the early days were a struggle, I have no regrets.\nChoosing to become a mother involved a lot of planning and considerations: emotional, physical, and financial. I had to consider:\n- Can I afford this?\n- What financial help is available to me?\n- How long can I take maternity leave?\n- Will I be able to cope with pregnancy, physically and mentally?\n- Will I be enough?\nThe journey begins\nIn late 2017, I started trying to conceive at home, with a known donor.\nAlthough many SMBCs undergo IUI (intrauterine insemination) or IVF (in vitro fertilisation) doing this can be very expensive, with many spending all their savings or even dipping into their superannuation to undergo fertility treatment.\nThe decision to start trying came only a few months after I started to take control of my finances and work towards becoming debt-free.\nI grew up in a low-income family where financial literacy wasn't something I remember being taught.\nI knew that if I wanted to become a single parent, I would need to be in a better financial position than I currently was.\nMy future child became my reason for turning things around.\nAlongside trying, I was building my savings and paying off my debt. I became debt free in 2018 and a year after that, I fell pregnant with my son, who was born in August of 2020.\nBy the time my son was born I had $40,000 in savings. I'd been made redundant in late 2018, receiving a payout that helped boost my savings.\nI was in a new job within three months, though, making sure that my new job had paid maternity leave so that I could take time off with my baby.\nCareful planning goes a long way\nFor me and many other SMBCs, financial considerations are a big factor in the decision to have a child.\nFor single parents, whilst there is help from Centrelink, you are limited in the income you can make while you aren't working.\nTaking any form of maternity leave requires careful planning, because it's not financially feasible to stay at home for long without savings to top you up.\nMaternity leave and financial support were the biggest considerations for other SMBCs that I spoke to.\n\"Before I become a SMBC, I moved from a contract job to an ongoing one to ensure I would qualify for workplace maternity leave, as well as government paid parental leave,\" says Sarah, surname withheld for privacy.\n\"I had money saved up to finance my fertility treatment as I didn't want to have to dip into my super or take out a loan. Once I was pregnant, I saved as much as I could, as I knew I wanted to be able stay home with my baby for as long as possible.\"\nPersonally, I spent the first year at home with my son. This consisted of 17 weeks of a mix of annual leave and maternity leave from my workplace and then 18 weeks of paid parental leave (PPL).\nAfter my PPL finished, I lived on benefits, topped up with my savings as needed. Centrelink benefits brought in 40 per cent less than I was making at my full-time job, which meant there was some strict budgeting going on.\nI utilised all the cost-cutting measures I could, like buying second-hand clothing, toys or goods and more generally, working out the difference between a want or a need.\nNavigating return to work as a solo parent\nMaking the decision to return to work was another complex one, weighing up the cost of childcare with how much I would earn working part time or full time and then how my benefits would change.\nStriking the right balance can be tricky.\nUltimately, I returned to work part time so that I could still spend part of my week with my son. This balance gives me the best of both worlds: raising my son and working.\nUnderstanding what Centrelink payments you're entitled to is also important, as these can help complement your work income. It can be a mine field, but the extra income really makes a difference.\nFor us, the future looks good. Amidst all the cost-of-living problems we are doing well (luckily).\nWe live frugally, but I'm still saving some money and working towards my goal of buying a house one day. A few years ago, I started investing some money in the stock market\nthrough exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nOnce we have our forever home, I hope to start saving and investing for my son. Alongside my own investment portfolio, I want to grow his so that he has something for when he leaves home.\nMy goal is simple. I want to teach him as much as I can about finances, so he doesn't make the mistakes that I did. I want him to thrive, not just \"survive\".\nABC Everyday in your inbox\nGet our newsletter for the best of ABC Everyday each week\nRelated Stories\nFrom beach houses to festivals, these romantic honeymoons didn't break the bank\nYou don't need a credit card.
