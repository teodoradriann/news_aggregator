    "title": "Sydney Mardi Gras 2024: Spectacular Parade Promises Dazzling Night Amid CBD Road Closures",
    "text": "As Sydney gears up for its iconic Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade in 2024, the city is abuzz with anticipation for an event that promises to be both a dazzling display of culture and a logistical feat. Scheduled for a Saturday night, the parade is set to feature over 200 floats and 12,000 marchers, drawing tens of thousands of spectators to the heart of the city. This massive gathering, however, comes with its share of challenges, particularly in terms of mobility and access.\nEvent Details and Transportation Planning\nWith festivities kicking off in the evening, road closures in the Sydney CBD will commence at 3 pm, affecting major thoroughfares such as College Street, Wentworth Avenue, and several surrounding streets until midnight. The closures extend to parts of Bourke Street, Campbell Street, and nearby areas in Surry Hills as the crowd congregates. Authorities have put an extensive public transport plan in place to facilitate easy access to the event, with extended light rail and bus services. Train services are also ramped up, ensuring frequent trips to accommodate the influx of parade-goers. Pedestrian crossings along the parade route will be shut down post-7 pm, necessitating early planning for those intending to witness the grandeur of the Mardi Gras Parade.\nAdvisory for Spectators\nSpectators are strongly advised to leverage public transport for their travel to and from the parade. Designated train stations have been recommended for easier access to different sides of the parade route. However, it's important to note that trackwork on certain lines may affect train services. Hence, parade enthusiasts are reminded to plan their trips ahead of time, taking into account the additional public transport services and the potential impact of trackwork. This proactive approach will ensure a smoother experience in navigating the expectedly crowded city.\nEngagement and Safety Measures\nThe Sydney Mardi Gras Parade is more than just a celebration; it's a vibrant expression of culture, diversity, and rights advocacy. With the event drawing large numbers, safety and accessibility are paramount. Authorities have meticulously planned road closures, transport adjustments, and pedestrian access to ensure that the event remains a joyous occasion for everyone involved. Participants and spectators alike are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the event details, including transport options and road closure information, to fully enjoy the spectacle that the Sydney Mardi Gras Parade promises to be.\nAs the countdown to the parade begins, the excitement is palpable. The Sydney Mardi Gras Parade stands as a testament to the city's vibrant spirit and its unwavering commitment to celebrating diversity. While the logistical challenges of hosting such a large-scale event are significant, the collective effort of the community and authorities ensures that the parade will not only be a night of spectacular entertainment but also a smoothly run event that honors the essence of inclusivity and celebration.",

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — The Skylark Lounge, a cherished blues and soul venue in East Austin, announced it will permanently close its doors on Sunday, May 4, after 12 years of operation.\nFounded on the principles of honoring the heritage of East Austin, Skylark has been a stage for local blues and soul music legends, many in their 70s and 80s, ensuring their contributions and talents were celebrated.\nOver the years, these seasoned musicians have mentored the next generation, creating a welcoming space for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, or background.\nALSO| Missing bulldog found 1,000 miles away, reunited with family after four years\nOwners Johnny and Mary LaTouf have been instrumental in creating a venue that respects the rich musical traditions of East Austin.\nUnlike many closures in East Austin, Skylark's end isn't driven by gentrification or rising rents. The LaToufs, now in their 60s, say the decision is entirely personal. “We’re choosing to end this chapter with grace and gratitude,” they said in a joint statement.\nTo honor its legacy, Skylark Lounge is hosting a five-night farewell celebration starting Wednesday, April 30, and concluding with a performance by Soul Man Sam on Sunday, May 4.\nThe venue, located at 2039 Airport Blvd., will be open from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., and all ages are welcome.",

    "text": "Carne con Chile Burritos\nRecipe Yield\nCooking time\nRate this recipe\nIngredients\nFor the meat:\n- 6 pounds beef brisket trimmed of some of the fat and cut into 2-inch chunks\n- 1/2 white onion\n- 5 garlic cloves peeled\n- 2 bay leaves\n- 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns\nFor the carne con chile:\n- 10 to 12 dried chiles colorados a.k.a. New Mexico chiles, California chiles and dried Anaheim chiles, stemmed and seeded (if unavailable, substitute guajillos)\n- 2 large ripe roma tomatoes about 1/2 pound\n- 2 peeled garlic cloves\n- 1/4 cup coarsely chopped onion\n- 5 dried chiltepin chiles if available (ideal but can skip them if you don’t find them)\n- 2 dried chiles de árbol stemmed\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt or to taste\n- 4 cups beef broth from cooking the meat\n- 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil\n- 2 tablespoons all purpose flour\nFor the burritos:\n- 8 to 10\n[flour tortillas](/flour-tortillas/) - Sliced or diced avocado\n- Queso fresco crumbled\n- Mexican crema\n- Pico de gallo salsa or salsa of your choice\n- Shredded romaine lettuce\nTo Prepare\nTo cook the meat:\n- Place the meat in a large pot and cover with at least 12 cups water. Add the white onion half, 5 garlic cloves, bay leaves, salt and black peppercorns. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Skim off any foam that rises to the top, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the meat is completely cooked through and tender enough to pull apart easily with your fingers, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.\n- Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat from the broth and place in a bowl. Strain the broth into a separate bowl or container. Measure out 4 cups and freeze the rest for another use. Once the meat is cool enough to handle, shred into smaller bite size pieces and remove and discard the fat. Set aside.\nTo make the carne con chile:\n- Place the chiles colorados, tomatoes, and 2 garlic cloves in a medium saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat slightly and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes until the chiles have plumped up and rehydrated, and the tomatoes are fully cooked and mushy. Transfer the chiles, tomatoes, garlic and a 1/2 cup of their cooking liquid to a blender. Add the chopped white onion, chiltepin chiles, chiles de árbol, oregano and salt. Puree until completely smooth.\n- Heat the lard or oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. Add the flour and stir together well to create a roux. Cook, stirring, for a minute or two until bubbling and lightly browned. Add the chile colorado puree. Cook, stirring often, making sure the mixture doesn’t stick and burn on the bottom of the pan, until it has thickened and darkened slightly, about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the beef broth and the shredded cooked meat and bring to a simmer, stirring. Reduce heat to medium, cover partially, and continue to cook, stirring often and scraping the bottom of the pot until the sauce has thickened and the meat is well seasoned, coated with the chile mixture, and so tender it is falling apart, about 30 minutes. Taste and adjust salt. Remove from the heat.\nTo make the burritos:\n- Heat the tortillas on a preheated comal or skillet. Top with 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the carne con chile and roll into burritos. Once assembled, you can heat them for another minute if you want them a bit toasted, or eat them soft, just as soon as they are assembled.\n- Serve with sliced or diced avocado, crumbled queso fresco, crema, salsa and lettuce, and let people garnish to taste.",
