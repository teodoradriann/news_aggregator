Julio Duarte Send an email 05/07/2024 1 minuto a ler No dia 2 de julho, a Praia Grande de Porto Covo foi o palco da cerimónia nacional de hastear da bandeira “ Praia Qualidade de Ouro 2024 ”. Este galardão, atribuído pela Quercus, reconhece a excelência das águas balneares das praias Grande de Porto Covo, São Torpes e Vale Figueiros/Vieirinha.\nA escolha da Praia Grande de Porto Covo para a cerimónia oficial deve-se ao empenho da Câmara Municipal de Sines na proteção ambiental e às Águas de Santo André, responsável pelo tratamento de águas residuais, essenciais para a preservação dos ecossistemas marinhos.\nDurante o evento, Nuno Mascarenhas, presidente da Câmara Municipal de Sines, expressou gratidão à Quercus e sublinhou a importância do reconhecimento: “ Esta é uma cerimónia significativa. A Praia Grande de Porto Covo é exemplar e uma das áreas mais bem preservadas da região ”.\nMascarenhas destacou ainda os esforços municipais para manter a qualidade das praias através da reabilitação de acessos, estacionamentos e da requalificação da orla costeira. “ Acreditamos no potencial do nosso território e trabalhamos para valorizar a nossa região ”, afirmou. Também mencionou o impacto positivo dos investimentos privados no fortalecimento do concelho de Sines.",

More content below BYND TSN WMT MAT MCD YUM TGT\nCooking up change in a well-entrenched, well-capitalized industry isn't easy.\nSuch is the story of the ticker symbol BYND, formally known down supermarket aisles across America as Beyond Meat ( BYND ).\nWhile the price of Beyond Meat stock has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown hasn’t. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry exec remains laser-focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n\"We believe the arc of history is on our side and that we're going to make this thing into the long-term success that we've been after,\" Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above).\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business. Beyond Meat burst onto investors' radar on May 5, 2019, with a sizzling initial public offering on the Nasdaq.\nInvestors devoured shares of a company they saw as the leader in the budding plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded: a tasty 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite, May 2, 2019, in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images) From there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, with big deals with global restaurant chains such as Yum! Brands-owned KFC and Dunkin’ Donuts ( YUM ), expansion plans into the refrigerated food sections at Target ( TGT ) and retailers overseas, and efforts underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items.\nBy July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the restaurant industry, and its financial toll sent people back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat’s impressive momentum stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including at rival Impossible Foods .\nAlong the way, attacks from entrenched parties in the meat industry and media on the healthiness of plant-based items hurt Beyond Meat’s standing with consumers. By November 2022, with losses eating into cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its workforce.\nStory continues Then in November of this year, Beyond Meat — which has cut prices to stimulate demand — said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter.\nThird quarter sales fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million on an adjusted operating profit basis.\n\"You know that there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and particularly after the IPO, that it was going to happen overnight,\" Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round of layoffs. \"That obviously has not proven to be the case.\"\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: Surround yourself with great people, have that long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course. \"But the very reason that we started this company and the very reason that consumers are reaching for a product strengthens every single day, whether it's the health angle, whether it's climate, whether it's the energy and water use or animal welfare,\" Brown continued. \"All of those issues are intensifying, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.\"\nToday, Beyond Meat stock trades at $8.95 a share — well off its dizzying post-IPO heights. The company's market cap is $577.6 million compared to $18.46 billion for meat king Tyson ( TSN ), per Yahoo Finance comparison data .\n\"In terms of what’s driving the US softness, it’s more of the same: Consumers just continue to shy away from the category for a variety of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or the lack thereof),\" JPMorgan packaged food analyst Ken Goldman said.\nGoldman rates Beyond Meat shares Underweight, the equivalent of a Sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) about the path forward for the plant-based meat company inside its new El Segundo, Calif., headquarters. (Yahoo Finance) Meanwhile, Brown remains focused on defying the critics. Beyond Meat has recently opened a sprawling 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, Calif., steps away from the HQ of Barbie maker Mattel ( MAT ). The location is outfitted with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a generally open floor plan that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food.\nThe new facility even has a McDonald’s ( MCD ) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often makes the rounds in the building to chat up employees with his trademark cool, welcoming vibe.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won’t be easy and he isn't yet in the mindset to reflect on the path of the business to this point. But he will not be deterred in his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and hustle.\n\"I have to see [my mission] through to completion,\" Brown said. \"I think it'll be something [that] when it's said and done, I might look back. But right now I'm in the fight, so it's hard to see.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn .

One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "text": "I-League fans face OTP hassle with SSEN website/app\nMany fans complained about issues regarding login in SSEN platform.\nThe new season of the I-League commenced with a thrilling opener between Gokulam Kerala and Sreenidi Deccan, setting the tone for what promises to be an electrifying competition. Sreenidi Deccan, a team that narrowly missed ISL promotion last season by just four points, looked to kick off their campaign with renewed determination.\nThis season, a total of 13 teams from across India, representing the vast diversity of the nation’s footballing talent, are competing for glory in the second tier of Indian football.\nHowever, the excitement on the pitch was initially overshadowed by a storm of controversies off it. The broadcasting rights for the league were a significant point of contention, with clubs voicing their frustration over the lack of clarity.\nIn an unprecedented move, multiple teams came together to hold joint press conferences, urging stakeholders to resolve the issue promptly. Their collective demand reflected the urgency of addressing the concerns of the footballing fraternity and fans alike.\nI-League platform face issues\nAmidst the turmoil, a breakthrough came when Sony Sports Network announced it would broadcast I-League matches from Matchweek 2 onwards, bringing much-needed relief to fans who had been eagerly awaiting updates.\nFurthermore, SSEN secured streaming rights for the league on its OTT platform, ensuring greater accessibility for tech-savvy audiences. This decision was hailed as a positive step towards elevating the visibility of Indian football.\nHowever, the optimism surrounding the broadcast announcement has been marred by technical glitches on the SSEN OTT platform. Many fans have reported issues while attempting to log in, citing repeated “OTP incorrect” notifications that prevent them from accessing live matches. This has led to mounting frustration among Indian football enthusiasts, who had hoped for an uninterrupted viewing experience.\nAdding to this, fans expressed concerns over the timing of the resolution of these broadcasting disputes, which delayed the availability of coverage from the very start of the season.\nWhile Sony’s intervention has brought relief, the absence of broadcasts during the crucial Matchweek 1 fixtures has left a gap in the league’s momentum. Clubs, players, and fans are now hoping that such delays do not recur in the future.\nFor Indian football, the I-League is not just a competition but a critical platform for nurturing local talent and fostering the sport’s growth at the grassroots level.\nThe league has produced several stars who have gone on to represent the nation on bigger stages, and its visibility is key to maintaining this trajectory. Fans are now urging SSEN and the league organizers to address these technical issues swiftly so that the focus can return to the game itself.\nAs the league progresses, the narrative shifts back to the action on the field. Teams are fighting not just for the I-League trophy but also for the chance to gain promotion to the Indian Super League under the new system, adding more stakes to the competition.\nWith the broadcast issues hopefully resolved soon, fans will be eager to witness the journey of their favorite teams as they vie for supremacy in Indian football.\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube; download the Khel Now Android App or IOS App and join our community on Whatsapp & Telegram.\nHellas Verona vs Inter Milan Prediction, lineups, betting tips & oddsI-League 2024-25: All six foreigners of Inter Kashi FCAl Nassr vs Al Qadisiyah: Live streaming, TV channel, kick-off time & where to watch Saudi Pro League 2024-25I-League fans face OTP hassle with SSEN website/appNeymar's 'I wish i were there too' comment on Messi & Suarez hints at possible Inter Miami transfer\nAshutosh Mehta on ISL comeback, national team call-up, relationship with Khalid Jamil & morePetr Kratky highlights this Mumbai City FC player's performance against Kerala BlastersMohun Bagan not be fined by AFC after recognising their case as 'Event of Force Majeure'How much bonus did Vinicius Jr miss out on after losing Ballon d'Or 2024 award?Mats Hummels' girlfriend: Meet Nicola Cavanis, her job, Instagram & more",

The second officer then helped pull his colleague back onto the platform. The entire incident took place in just under a minute, based on the body camera.\n“I fell, I must have slipped off,” the man can be heard telling the officers in the footage.\nEMS crews transported the man to a local hospital with reports of hip and body pain, police said. The officers were not injured in the incident.\nThe same officers were involved in a rescue at a Brooklyn pier in October, the NYPD said.\nThey responded to a 911 call of a person possibly in the water in Erie Basin on the evening of Oct. 3.\nAlong with the Harbor Unit, the officers rescued a 20-year-old woman who was trapped in the water clinging onto a pier, police said.\nShe was transported to a local hospital in stable condition.\nThe post\nNYPD officers help rescue man who fell onto subway tracks appeared first on ABC News.",

    "text": "Apple хочет превратить Siri в Скрепыша из Windows\nIcma.az информирует, ссылаясь на сайт Zerkalo.az.\nApple планирует масштабное визуальное обновление для своего голосового помощника Siri, который получит анимированный интерфейс, известный как Bubbles. Об этом сообщил известный инсайдер и корреспондент издания Bloomberg Марк Гурман.\nКонцепция Bubbles предполагает создание анимированной личности для Siri, чтобы сделать ее более «живой» и интерактивной. Ранние тесты показывают, что Siri может выглядеть как анимированная версия культового смайлика Finder Mac, хотя рассматриваются и другие варианты, ближе к стилистике Memoji. Эта идея отдаленно напоминает «Скрепыша» (Clippy) – анимированного помощника из Microsoft Office 1990-х годов.\nМарк Гурман отмечает, что обновленная Siri станет ключевым элементом двух грядущих устройств Apple для умного дома: предположительно HomePad/HomePod Touch в 2026 году и безымянного «настольного робота» в 2027 году.\nОсобо значимой новая визуальная личность Siri станет для настольного робота. Это устройство описывается как iPad, установленный на подвижной конечности, способной поворачиваться и следовать за пользователями в комнате. Siri будет действовать как виртуальный компаньон, способный вмешиваться в разговоры, предлагать рестораны или рецепты, а также вести полноценные диалоги для планирования поездок или выполнения задач, подобно голосовому режиму OpenAI.\nХотя концепция Bubbles кажется центральной для робота 2027 года, визуальное обновление Siri может появиться гораздо раньше – уже в следующем году – вместе с устройством HomePad/HomePod Touch. Однако полные разговорные возможности, аналогичные тем, что будут у робота, появятся позже.\nhttps://zerkalo.az",

    "title": "Discover the Ancient Mystery: Prehistoric Humans Carved Rock Art Next to Dinosaur Footprints, Study Reveals",
    "text": "Prehistoric humans in Brazil have left behind a fascinating clue to their past. Rock carvings, known as petroglyphs, have been found next to dinosaur footprints at a site called Serrote do Letreiro in Paraíba, Brazil. These carvings suggest that prehistoric humans may have found the footprints meaningful or interesting. The petroglyphs were first observed in 1975, but their connection to the footprints was only recently discovered through field surveys aided by drones. The footprints belong to dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period, which ended 66 million years ago. According to Leonardo Troiano, an archaeologist at the Institute of National Historic and Artistic Heritage in Brasilia, the petroglyphs challenge the assumption that Indigenous people were not aware of their surroundings or did not have scientific curiosity. Troiano stated, “It’s very clear that they were interested in the footprints. We’ll never know if they knew about dinosaurs, but it is clear that they were curious about the prints and thought they were meaningful in some way.” The Serrote do Letreiro petroglyphs are not the first examples of rock art found near dinosaur prints. However, the unprecedented clarity of the association between the petroglyphs and the footprints at this particular site could have significant implications across various fields of study, including paleontology, archaeology, and cultural heritage. The drawings found at Serrote do Letreiro display a variety of styles, suggesting multiple artists may have been involved. Some of the drawings resemble plants, while others feature geometric shapes such as squares, rectangles, and circles. The circles often contain crosses or lines inside them, which could be interpreted as stars. However, the true meaning of these markings remains a mystery. Troiano stated, “They all seem to be abstract, and if they represented something to the people who made them, we don’t know what it is.” The researchers believe that the petroglyphs were created by Indigenous communities living in the region between 9,400 and 2,620 years ago, based on radiocarbon dating of nearby burial sites. These communities likely used the natural rocky shelters in the area for small gatherings. One possible interpretation of the drawings is that they were created within a ritual context. Troiano suggests that the people may have gathered and utilized psychotropic plants, such as the hallucinogenic jurema, which is still abundant in the region today. The footprints in the rock may have been identified as significant, prompting the communities to create the petroglyphs near them. This discovery at Serrote do Letreiro adds to the growing body of evidence showing the close relationship between ancient people and their environment. The direct association of the petroglyphs with dinosaur fossil tracks sheds light on the importance and significance of rock art in ancient cultures. While the Serrote do Letreiro petroglyphs are a unique case, there are other sites around the world where rock art exists in the vicinity of dinosaur footprints. However, the level of intentionality and proximity between the drawings and prints at Serrote do Letreiro sets it apart. Overall, this discovery opens up new possibilities for understanding the ways in which ancient cultures interacted with and interpreted the world around them. The implications of this research extend beyond archaeology and paleontology, offering insights into the human tendency to tie spiritual and imaginative realms to the unexplained phenomena present in the natural world .

Jan Simek, a distinguished professor of anthropology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, highlights the significance of this discovery. He explains that ancient people often incorporated fossils and other unexplained elements of the natural world into their religious experiences and interpretations. This tendency can be observed across different cultures throughout history. The Brazil case adds to the growing body of evidence that shows how humans throughout history have attributed spiritual and cultural significance to the world around them. The close proximity between the petroglyphs and dinosaur footprints at Serrote do Letreiro provides a unique example of this human tendency. While this discovery provides valuable insights into ancient cultures, it also raises important questions about our current relationship with the natural world . How do we interpret and understand the natural wonders around us today? Are there ways in which we can better appreciate and connect with the world ’s rich history and heritage? As we continue to make new discoveries and unearth ancient mysteries, it is crucial that we strive to learn from the past and apply those lessons to our present and future. By examining the ways in which ancient cultures interacted with their surroundings, we can gain a deeper understanding of our own place in the world and our responsibilities as custodians of the planet.
