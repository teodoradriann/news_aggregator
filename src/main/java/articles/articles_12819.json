    "title": "'Arteta furious': Journalist says Arsenal boss was livid with what 27-year-old did in first-half vs West Ham",
    "text": "Journalist James Benge noticed that Mikel Arteta was furious with one Arsenal player during the first-half against West Ham on Thursday. The Gunners went into the break 1-0 down after a goal from Tomas Soucek. It was a controversial goal for the Hammers, with the VAR unable to determine whether the ball went out before Jarrod Bowen found Soucek in the six-yard box. It proved to be a really tough first-half for [Oleksandr Zinchenko](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/oleksandr-zinchenko/) at the Emirates. The Ukrainian’s form has been a talking point for a little while. Mikel Arteta furious with Oleksandr Zinchenko in Arsenal clash [Zinchenko was poor in the draw with Liverpool](https://tbrfootball.com/espn-pundit-tears-into-poor-arsenal-player-after-liverpool-draw/), easily letting Mohamed Salah past him for the Reds’ goal at Anfield. And he did not cover himself in glory for Soucek’s goal either. But it was a moment later in the half which appeared to anger his manager. James Benge, [posting on X](https://x.com/jamesbenge/status/1740478064168157395?s=20), noticed that [Mikel Arteta](https://tbrfootball.com/tag/mikel-arteta/) was livid with the left-back after one particular pass to a teammate… MORE ARSENAL STORIES Left-back’s form causing the Gunners some problems The form of Zinchenko surely has to be a major concern. He definitely has amazing ability going forward. And he knows exactly how to play the inverted role Arteta wants him to play. However, he is arguably not as good a defender as Jurrien Timber, Takehiro Tomiyasu or even Kieran Tierney. And that has cost Arsenal on a couple of occasions now. Arteta, at this point, has to weigh up whether what Zinchenko brings towards one end of the pitch outweighs the limitations he arguably has defensively. Arsenal have not been at their best this season. They have generally found a way to still win. But that was not the case on Thursday. And with that, some harsh questions may be being asked heading into January. It would be a surprise if Arsenal targeted another left-back next month given the options they have when everyone is fit. But it really does appear that Zinchenko’s form is causing the Gunners a few issues right now. And with Liverpool top and Manchester City poised, Arteta really cannot afford to spend too long looking for answers.",
