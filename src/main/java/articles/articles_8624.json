    "text": "Venezuela despliega tropas en ejercicios militares por \"amenaza\" de buque británico en Guyana ¿Qué pasó? Más de 5.600 efectivos participaron este jueves en ejercicios militares ordenados por el presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, en respuesta a la llegada de un buque de guerra británico a Guyana, que negó tener planes para una \"acción ofensiva\" contra su vecino. La llegada del HMS Trent rompe una frágil tregua entre ambos países dentro de una centenaria pugna por el territorio del Esequibo, rico en petróleo, que se avivó en los últimos meses. [Ir a la siguiente nota](https://www.meganoticias.cl/mundo/435126-asteroide-dios-del-caos-99942-cuando-pasara-cerca-de-la-tierra-apofis-fecha-pdp-28-12-2023.html) El arribo de la nave de la Armada Británica asoma como una muestra de apoyo diplomático y militar a Guyana, considerando que la nación era una colonia y es la única del continente que sigue siendo parte de la Mancomunidad. ¿Qué dijeron desde Venezuela por el despliegue militar? En una cadena de radio y televisión, y acompañado del alto mando militar, Maduro señaló que \"he ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana sobre el Caribe Oriental de Venezuela, sobre la Fachada Atlántica\". El mandatario señaló que se trata de \"una acción conjunta de carácter defensiva y como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país\". ¿Qué dijeron desde Guyana? En tanto, desde Guyana negaron que la llegada del HSM Trent responda a \"planes\" para un ataque. Estas son \"asociaciones\" destinadas a \"mejorar la seguridad interna\" y \"no representan una amenaza para nadie y de ninguna manera pretenden ser agresivas o constituir un acto ofensivo\", dijo el presidente guyanés, Irfaan Ali, en Facebook. \"Ni Venezuela ni ningún otro Estado tiene nada que temer de las actividades dentro del territorio o aguas soberanas de Guyana\", añadió Ali que envió sus \"mejores deseos\" a Venezuela. Más temprano, el vicepresidente guyanés, Barrat Jagdeo, señaló que Guyana no tenía planeado \"invadir Venezuela\". \"El presidente Maduro lo sabe\", dijo Jagdeo, quien descartó cancelar \"la actitivad programada\" con los británicos. Una fuente del ministerio de Exteriores de Guyana dijo a la AFP más temprano que el buque arribará a las costas de ese país el viernes, donde permanecerá por \"menos de una semana\" para ejercicios de defensa en mar abierto. No tiene previsto atracar en Georgetown. Leer más de",

    "text": "Guest Commentary Rick Warren Under Fire for Tweet about Crucifixion Rick Warren, former pastor of Saddleback Church, faced backlash after tweeting that Jesus' position between two thieves symbolized a centrist... Vicky Arias Updated Feb 17, 2025\nFormer pastor of Saddleback Church in California, Rick Warren, is receiving backlash after posting a tweet that many viewed as an improper application of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Warren's tweet on Feb. 11 likened Jesus' central position between two thieves during His Crucifixion to Him landing somewhere in the center of today's political landscape rather than on one side or the other.\n\"If you're looking for the #realJesus, not a caricature disfigured by partisan motivations, you'll find him in the middle, not on either side,\" Warren stated.\nThe evangelist deleted the tweet within a few days, but not before it had more than three million views. Ah, man. And @RickWarren never bothered responding to me either 😔 🤣 pic.twitter.com/EQEn6Fxnar\n— Gabriel Padilla (@gdilla_) February 14, 2025 The statement prompted many conservative Christians to criticize Warren's theology.\nAllie Beth Stuckey, a conservative podcaster and author, denounced the tweet as \"lukewarm,\" noting that Jesus has and teaches very definitive stances.\n\"This is possibly the worst Biblical interpretation I've ever seen, and that's really saying something,\" Stuckey stated. \"Jesus is not 'in the middle' on the murder of children, gender deception, the definition of marriage , or anything else, for that matter. In fact, I seem to remember Him having a particular disdain for the lukewarm.\" With Jesus, it’s not the things he said that people might not understand, but it’s usually the things they understand that cause them angst. Read the Bible for yourself, see what Jesus really did and said, don’t just accept the word of certain teachers. Scripture sides with Allie… https://t.co/jiYIE6xwmv\n— Terry Unrein (@StorageBytes) February 12, 2025 Daily Wire host Michael Knowles pointed to the seriousness of the decisions made by each of the thieves who were hung next to Jesus.\n\"Except that the thief to Our Lord's right is in Heaven, and the thief to His left is in Hell ,\" Knowles declared. \"Not the best analogy for the point you wish to make.\"\nThe CEO of the Babylon Bee, Seth Dillon, also chimed in, explaining with a bit of sarcasm that Jesus stood His ground and never compromised the truth.\n\"Yeah, because if there's one thing Jesus was known for, it was his desire to meet in the middle and compromise on the issues that matter most,\" Dillon asserted.\nSaddleback Church, founded by Warren in 1980, was removed from the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) denomination in 2023 after allowing a woman to hold the title of teaching pastor.\nAfter Warren retired in 2022, Stacie Wood, the wife of the new lead pastor of Saddleback, Pastor Andy Wood, was named pastor of the church, defying SBC's stance on women being disallowed in the capacity of pastor.\nWarren gave a statement at a 2023 SBC meeting, asking for the church not to be removed, though the church's removal did , in fact, come to pass.\n\"We should remove churches for all kinds of sexual sins, racial sin, financial sin, leadership sin, sins that harm the testimony of our convention,\" Warren stated. \"But the 1,129 churches with women on pastoral staff have not sinned.\"\nJenna Ellis, podcast host and attorney , tweeted that Jesus wasn't a \"moderate.\"\n\"Jesus is not a moderate or 'in the middle' when it comes to truth,\" Ellis stated. \"To characterize him as such simply because of the placement of his cross is perverting a historical fact into a symbolic meaning to serve your own ideological agenda.\"\nOn Sunday, Warren tweeted an apology.\n\"I apologize,\" Warren stated. \"I wrote poorly. I don't believe Jesus was a centrist. He stands far above it all. 'My kingdom is not of this world...' Jn. 18:36 Jesus demands our total allegiance as the center of our lives.\" I apologize. I wrote poorly.\nI don't believe Jesus was a centrist. He stands far above it all. “My kingdom is not of this world...\" Jn.18:36\nJesus demands our total allegiance as the center of our lives.\n— Rick Warren (@RickWarren) February 16, 2025 Photo Credit: ©RNS/Adelle M.
