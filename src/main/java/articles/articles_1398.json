    "text": "FALL RIVER, Mass. — The Board at Temple Beth El has decided to sell their synagogue in Fall River and move to a smaller location within the city. Rabbi Mark Elber told NBC 10 the congregation doesn't have enough members to sustain it. \"There are a few leaks in the roof, it's a building that's 95-years-old,\" said Rabbi Elber. He said the board, which is not connected to Temple Beth El in Providence, made a unanimous decision to sell the Fall River Synagogue. Rabbi Elber has been at the Fall River Synagogue since 2013. \"I don't know what will happen, but I hate to think of it being torn down, it would be incredibly sad,\" he said. The High St. Location has been a place of peace for the Jewish population in Bristol County and beyond. \"All of these small towns around here, we draw from them, but right now it's not enough,\" he said. Rabbi Elver said when he first arrived in 2013, there were about 250 members. Now, he said there's about 50 active members. Although the number is too low to maintain the building, he said it's not too low to maintain the congregation. \"That's our main priority,\" he said. \"So even though we won't have this building, nevertheless we will find another space,\" said Elber. The Rabbi told NBC 10 he still has hope for the High St. location, as a commuter rail could bring new residents and a generous person could potentially step forward to save the only synagogue left in the city. \"There are people here who have been here their entire lives,\" said Rabbi Elber. \"Their grandparents were here, so they grew up in this place, they like to sit in the seats they sat in with their grandparents,\" he said. Elber said any potential donors could reach out to the board.",

    "text": "Football Les Girondins de Bordeaux renoncent à leur statut professionnel Le club bordelais, relégué mardi en National, a annoncé jeudi qu'il préférait renoncer à son statut professionnel pour éviter des sanctions supplémentaires. Les jours se suivent et se ressemblent aux Girondins de Bordeaux. Le club au Scapulaire, [rétrogadé en National](/sport/2024/07/23/l2-bordeaux-renonce-a-son-appel-et-retrograde-administrativement-en-national), a renoncé jeudi au statut professionnel obtenu en 1937. Une décision aux « conséquences funestes », selon le maire de la ville [Pierre Hurmic](/p/pierre-hurmic), qui déplore notamment la fermeture du centre de formation. Dans un communiqué publié jeudi soir, le club, qui avait terminé 12e de Ligue 2 mais a été sanctionné pour ses errements financiers, indique avoir « déposé le bilan » mardi auprès du Tribunal de commerce « afin d'entamer la restructuration nécessaire », ce qui aura pour conséquence « très prochainement » « l'ouverture d'une procédure collective qui entraînera automatiquement la perte du statut professionnel du club ». La crainte de « sanctions supplémentaires » La saison de National débutant mi-août, le club a préféré « renoncer à demander le maintien de son statut professionnel faute de quoi il aurait dû se présenter à nouveau devant la DNCG (Direction nationale du contrôle de gestion) avec un budget ne correspondant pas à (s)a réalité à venir (...), ce qui aurait pu le conduire à des sanctions supplémentaires lourdes ». Cet « effort de transparence » sur « la situation réelle du club » « doit notamment permettre de limiter les conséquences sportives de cette situation », poursuivent les Girondins qui ont « pour objectif d'évoluer en National 1 la saison prochaine, pour permettre, au plus vite, le retour du Club, avec des finances assainies et une ambition renouvelée, au plus haut niveau ». Le maire de Bordeaux en colère L'équipe sextuple championne de France pouvait pourtant espérer conserver le statut professionnel, et donc son centre de formation, si elle était autorisée à repartir en National, division hybride mêlant clubs pros et amateurs. Mais sa direction, qui espère que le tribunal de commerce privilégiera le redressement judiciaire à une liquidation pure et simple, a semble-t-il préféré faire table rase des contrats en vigueur en raison des difficultés du club, qui cherchait 40 millions d'euros pour assainir ses comptes et boucler son budget 2024-2025 en Ligue 2. « J'apprends avec consternation la décision soudaine autant que personnelle de Gérard Lopez, a cinglé Pierre Hurmic dans une déclaration transmise à l'AFP. Elle confirme des choix de gestion hasardeux qui ont amené en trois saisons notre club qui évoluait dans l'élite de la L1 au niveau amateur. » La fin de 87 ans chez les professionnels « L'abandon du statut professionnel aura des conséquences funestes avec, en premier lieu, la disparition du centre de formation », ajoute le maire écologiste, qui affirme « que d'autres options étaient et seraient encore possibles pour sauver le club ». « Si la gouvernance actuelle n'a plus le ressort, les moyens, l'envie de défendre avec énergie la survie de notre club centenaire, patrimoine commun de notre territoire, alors, elle doit en tirer toutes les conséquences », conclut-il. Cet abandon de statut met un terme à 87 années d'appartenance du FC Girondins de Bordeaux au football professionnel français et liquide son très réputé centre de formation, où ont notamment été formés les internationaux français actuels [Jules Koundé](/p/jules-kounde) (FC Barcelone) et [Aurélien Tchouaméni](/p/aurelien-tchouameni) (Real Madrid). Se pose également la question de l'avenir du personnel administratif (90 salariés).",

    "text": "BRAC reports massive job growth in 2023, expects more than 17,000 jobs in next two years BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - The Baton Rouge Area Chamber reported massive job growth in 2023 and expects that trend to continue in 2024. Andrew Fitzgerald, Senior Vice President of Business Intelligence at BRAC reported an all-time high for jobs with more than 428,000 people working in the Capital Region. He anticipates 17,000 more jobs in the next two years. Some new businesses brought to Baton Rouge in 2023 include Placid Refining, which is an independent petroleum refining company. The company announced that they are investing $66 million to relocate its headquarters from Dallas to Baton Rouge. BRAC also saw a new start-up in the cyber security space, among other traditional oil and gas and petrochemical projects. Fitzgerald said 500 jobs were added from the following projects this year. He anticipates the rapid growth to continue in the new year as there are billions of dollars of projects in the pipeline that are waiting to make a final investment decision in the transitional and renewable energy space. “We are a particularly strong area for carbon capture because of our geology, and that will add to our construction sector,” Fitzgerald said. “That is already the fastest growing construction sector in the country out of the 300+ metro areas, we had 20% growth over the year in the construction jobs.” BRAC is working with the local firm, 368, to develop a brand to draw in more talent. They will be having a soft lunch at their annual meeting in February and then by the end of the first quarter, they will launch it nationally. “We found that through a lot of national polling that we’ve done is that people don’t have a good or bad opinion about Baton Rouge, they just don’t know about Baton Rouge,” said Fitzgerald. “So we are launching a $1 million plus talent attraction campaign to let people know what we have to offer whether it’s for their career culturally, personally, just what the region has.” He said now’s the time to retain young talent as the Capital Region has an all-time high of more than 62,000 college students. “We need to ensure that we start early,” said Fitzgerald. We have a platform called Handshake we’re working with to try to connect college students to both internships and entry-level jobs in the region. This is important because once you start putting down routes, especially professionally, it’s difficult to leave and go to a new place and give that up.” [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo.

    "text": "MADRID, 28 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa empresaria francesa Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, nieta del fundador de L'Oréal, se ha convertido en la primera mujer en amasar una fortuna de 100.000 millones de dólares (90.327 millones de euros), según el índice de multimillonarios elaborado por Bloomberg.\nEn concreto, en la sesión del jueves, después de que las acciones de L'Oreal se anotasen una subida del 0,58%, hasta un precio récord de 451,30 euros, la fortuna estimada de la empresaria gala se elevaría a 100.200 millones de dólares (90.507 millones de euros).\nBettencourt Meyers, de 70 años, es vicepresidenta de la junta directiva de L'Oréal, empresa fundada en 1909 por su abuelo químico, Eugene Schueller, para producir y vender un tinte para el cabello que él había desarrollado y que se ha transformado en una empresa global, valorada en 241.000 millones de euros.\nComo hija única, Bettencourt Meyers heredó la mayor parte de la riqueza tras la muerte en 2017 de su madre, Liliane Bettencourt. Hoy en día, la empresaria y su familia son los mayores accionistas de L'Oreal, con casi el 35%.\nA pesar de la ganancia registrada, la fortuna de Bettencourt Meyers sigue siendo inferior a la de su compatriota francés Bernard Arnault, fundador de LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, que ocupaba el segundo lugar en el ranking mundial de ricos con un patrimonio estimado de 179.400 millones de dólares (162.046 millones de euros).\nMás información L'Oréal",
