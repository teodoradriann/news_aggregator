    "text": "Some of the world’s most popular apps are likely being co-opted by dishonest members of the advertising industry to collect sensitive location data on a mass scale, and that data ends up at a location data company whose subsidiary has previously sold location data global to US law enforcement.\nThe thousands of applications, included in pirated files from location data company Gravy Analytics, includes everything from games like candy crush and dating apps like Tinder to pregnancy tracking and religious prayer apps on both Android and iOS. Because much of the collection occurs through the advertising ecosystem (not code developed by the app creators themselves), it is likely that this data collection occurs without the knowledge of users or even app developers. applications.\n“For the first time publicly, we appear to have evidence that one of the largest data brokers that sells to commercial and government customers appears to be acquiring its data from online advertising ‘bid streams,’ rather than from code embedded in the own applications. Zach Edwards, a senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push who has followed the location data industry closely, tells 404 Media after reviewing some of the data.\nThe data provides a rare insight into the world of real-time bidding (RTB). Historically, location data companies paid app developers to include code packages that collect your users’ location data. Instead, many companies have resorted to Obtain location information through the advertising ecosystem. where companies bid to place ads within applications. But a side effect is that data brokers can listen in on that process and collect the locations of people’s cell phones.\n“This is a nightmare scenario for privacy, because not only does this data breach contain data extracted from RTB systems, but there is also a company acting as a global honey badger, doing as it pleases with every piece of data it is presented to him. says Edwards.\nIncluded in the hacked Gravy data are tens of millions of mobile phone coordinates from devices within the US, Russia and Europe. Some of those files also reference an app next to each location data. 404 Media extracted the app names and created a list of the mentioned apps.\nThe list includes dating sites Tinder and Grindr; massive games like candy crush , temple race , subway surfers and Harry Potter: puzzles and spells ; Moovit transit app; My Period Calendar & Tracker, a period tracking app with over 10 million downloads; the popular fitness app MyFitness Pro; Tumblr social network; Yahoo email client; Microsoft’s Office 365 app; and Flightradar24 flight tracker. The list also mentions multiple religion-focused apps, such as Muslim prayer and Christian Bible apps, several pregnancy trackers, and many VPN apps, which some users may download, ironically, in an attempt to protect their privacy.\nThe full list can be found here . Multiple security researchers have published other lists of applications included in the data, of different sizes. Our version is relatively larger because it includes Android and iOS apps, and we decided to keep duplicate instances of the same app that had slight name variations to make it easier for readers to search for apps they have installed.\nAlthough this data set came from an apparent Gravy hack, it is unclear whether Gravy collected this location data itself or obtained it from another company, or which location company owns or is licensed to use it.",

    "text": "Ocupación hotelera en la Riviera Maya cayó hasta un 60%; CPTQ\nEl pico ocupacional, según las estadísticas, se alcanzó el Viernes Santo de Semana Santa, con un porcentaje del 83.7%.\nTras la conclusión de las vacaciones de Semana Santa, la ocupación hotelera en la Riviera Maya se desplomó hasta 64%. Esto afecta a los 58 mil cuartos disponibles en el destino turístico.\nSe trata de una de las bajas más considerables en lo que va del año, luego de que había mantenido promedios del 80% de ocupación en los primeros cuatro meses del año, según datos del Consejo de Promoción Turística de Quintana Roo (CPTQ).\nEste porcentaje se registró apenas con el arranque de la semana, luego de que todos volvieron a clases. Para el martes ya teníamos una ocupación del 65%, con lo cual se prevé que se cierre la ocupación general. Durante abril el balance general alcanzó 76%, pese a la temporada vacacional de Semana Santa. La diferencia porcentual es marcada en un plano comparativo porque en abril del año pasado cerró con una ocupación del 85% en la Riviera Maya.\nAndrea Lotito, vicepresidente de la Asociación de Hoteles de la Riviera Maya atribuyó esta baja a la poca promoción turística del país.\n“Vemos es el efecto de años sin promoción a nivel federal (...) Tenemos que cuidar mucho los temas que han afectado a nuestros resultados y volver a ganar la confianza del turismo nacional que no sabe de las opciones económicas de la ciudad y se ha dejado espantar por episodios virales de servicios de transportación hostiles o caros, y de la seguridad .La comunicación es nuestra herramienta más fuerte y tenemos que mejorar ahí”, agregó.\nDijo que confían en la marca Let´s Playa, aunque hasta ahora no ha dado resultados. “Por supuesto seguimos otorgando un voto de confianza a la nueva marca que se promociona por parte del municipio. Playa del Carmen”, concluyó.\nEl pico ocupacional, según las estadísticas, se alcanzó el viernes 18, el Viernes Santo de Semana Santa, con un porcentaje del 83.7%, que no se compara a los picos del 90% que se alcanzan normalmente en la Riviera Maya en temporadas vacacionales.",

    "title": "'Doomsday fish' washed ashore in California, but what does that mean?",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If one oarfish landing on a beach is a sign of a disaster to come, how bad will it be if three wash up in quick succession?\nA silvery 10-foot-long creature, the oarfish has fueled fisherman's tales of sea serpents — and in some cultures has been a portent of natural disasters.\nIt's rare to see an oarfish up close in California; only 22 have washed ashore since 1901, according to UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. But in the last three months, three of them have surfaced on Southern California beaches.\nThe latest was on Nov. 6, when an oarfish was discovered at Grandview Beach by Alison Laferriere, a doctoral candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The other two beached in La Jolla and Huntington Beach.\nThe last time a series of oarfish came ashore in California and other parts of the world was over several months in 2013 and 2014. Misty Paig-Tran, associate professor of biological science at Cal State Fullerton, studied four of them.\nEvery time an oarfish makes an appearance on the sand, it's a spectacle for scientists as well as the general public for several reasons.\nTo start with, nobody is expecting a behemoth that's up to 25 feet long to come so close to the California coast, said Paig-Tran.\n\"What's special about them is that when they're freshly dead or just about to die and you look at their skin, it actually (looks) like a mirror,\" she said.\nIts length combines with its silver skin and bright red scarlet fins to give it a mythical look.\nSince the 1500s, sailors have told of sea monsters as long as their ships, and have even drafted maps that warned of areas in the ocean where such creatures resided. Their depictions appear to describe oarfish.\nOarfish generally live in the upper layers of the ocean depths, from about 300 feet to almost 3,000 feet underwater. Scientists call this section of the ocean the \"twilight zone\" because the fish that inhabit it are basically living in darkness with only a small glimpse of light, Paig-Tran said.\nThe twilight zone is too deep for divers to reach and explore, adding to the allure of this species.\nIf an oarfish happens to swim up to the ocean's surface, a sailor would see a long slithering creature with spiky protrusions on its head and could believe it was a sea monster, Paig-Tran said.\nIt's a jarring sight, but oarfish are anything but dangerous. Oarfish are bottom feeders, meaning they primarily feed on krill (a small shrimp-like creature) using powerful mouths shaped liked vacuum nozzles, according to Scripps.\nAn oarfish's body is extremely delicate, so much so that if you pick one up it could break in half because of its jelly-like bones, Paig-Tran said.\nAnother factor that adds to the mystique of this creature is the lack of knowledge about its history and daily life, including how it mates, when it lays eggs, what its movement patterns are and how often it feeds.\nScientists are able to study the creatures only when they wash up on a beach.\n\"When a body comes up, we can do our best to look to the biology and the physiology and try to make our best guesses, but we don't get to see it living in its natural environment,\" Paig-Tran said. \"It's a completely open-ended question of what's going on with these fishes.\"\nWhy are dead oarfish washing ashore?\nScientists don't know why these oarfish have died and washed ashore.\nThe latest oarfish spotted in Encinitas was recovered by a team of NOAA Fisheries Service and transported to Southwest Fisheries Science Center, where it will undergo an autopsy so researchers can learn more about the biology, anatomy, genomics and life history of oarfish, according to Scripps.\nThe deaths of the three fish that have surfaced \"may have to do with changes in ocean conditions and increased numbers of oarfish off our coast,\" said Ben Frable, manager of Scripps Oceanogaphy Marine Vertebrate Collection.\n\"Sometimes it may be linked to broader shifts, such as the El Niño and La Niña cycle, but this is not always the case,\" he said.\nThere was a weak El Niño earlier this year, and this wash-up coincided with the recent red tide and Santa Ana winds last week. But many other factors could have played a role in these strandings, Frable added.\nAnother possible explanation is that the oarfish got stuck in a current and couldn't go back down into deeper waters.\nOarfish aren't strong swimmers. They primarily rely on their dorsal fin, whereas strong swimmers use their caudal fin or back tail, Paig-Tran said.\nAn oarfish that gets caught in a current and is taken up to the surface doesn't have a good way to get back down.\n\"If you are a fish that lives in the deep and you got stuck on the surface, you're kind of hosed,\" she said.\nWhere did the \"doomsday\" name come from?\nOarfish have been dubbed \"doomsday\" fish because some cultures consider it a bad sign when they appear. The moniker is derived from a manipulation of Japanese folklore that became popular following the Fukushima disaster, Frable said.\n\"In the two years prior to the disaster, about a dozen oarfish washed up in Japan, most hundreds of miles away from this area.\" he said.\nIn the aftermath of the natural disaster, people latched onto these strandings as an omen of the disaster.\nThis prompted researchers in Japan in 2019 to test whether oarfish and other deep-sea animal strandings were correlated with earthquakes, tsunamis and other factors.\n\"They found no correlation whatsoever,\" Frable said. \"But the name is too evocative to disappear.\"\nOn the other hand, Paig-Tran said there could be some truth to the myth because when an earthquake happens, it releases pressure that can change a current underwater.\n\"When the pressure gets released, it changes the currents that [the fish are] living in, and it brings them up to the surface with this kind of big bolus of air and gasses and whatever the turbulence (is) from this earthquake,\" she said.\nSo, are the oarfish that surfaced in Southern California a harbinger of a massive earthquake? According to Paig-Tran: probably not.\n©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "text": "Karnataka : Coca-Cola India, through its foundation Anandana, has partnered with Gram Unnati to launch “Project Unnati Mango” in the Kolar and Ramanagara districts of Karnataka. This project, launched ahead of Mango Day, aims to enhance sustainable mango cultivation and boost productivity as well as the profitability of farmers cultivating Alphonso and Totapuri varieties in these districts. In line with Coca-Cola’s Viksit Kisan campaign and the Government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the project will train and equip farmers with modern techniques like High-Density plantations and drip irrigation, empowering them and improving their livelihoods.\nAdditionally, as part of the project, Anandana- The Coca-Cola India Foundation is collaborating with state horticulture agencies such as Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), the Mango Board, the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), and various district horticulture departments in Karnataka to promote the best agricultural practices among farming communities. This initiative will help farmers improve mango yields, quality, size, and shelf life. It also provides comprehensive support, including skill training and financial literacy enhancement.\nCommenting on the launch, Aneesh Jain, CEO and Founder, Gram Unnati , said, “Gram Unnati is proud to partner with Anandana- The Coca-Cola India Foundation on this transformative project that underscores our commitment to sustainable agriculture and farmer empowerment. By adopting modern practices and focusing on quality, we aim to significantly enhance the livelihoods of mango farmers in Karnataka. Together, we will drive sustainable growth and innovation in mango farming, benefiting farmers and the environment alike.”\n“Farmers are the backbone of India’s horticulture system. With Project Unnati Mango, we aim to elevate the livelihoods of these farmers with advanced horticulture solutions, empowering them to significantly increase their incomes. This aligns with the Government of India’s vision for AtmaNirbhar Bharat, making the agrarian economy self-reliant”, said, Rajesh Ayapilla, Senior Director- CSR and Sustainability for Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia.\nFurthermore, the project will also provide crop advisory services, climate forecasting, and alert systems to equip farmers with climate-smart techniques and improve crop traceability and sustainability. Special training modules have also been designed to empower female farmers, promoting gender equality in agriculture.\nAbout Project Unnati Program – Project Unnati Mango is an integral part of Coca-Cola’s Fruit Circular Economy initiative, which is centered on sustainable agriculture. This initiative by the company focuses on driving farm-level efficiencies through the implementation of best-practice techniques, such as ultra-high-density plantation (UHDP) and drip irrigation. Project Unnati is a key pillar of Coca-Cola India’s ESG priorities – Sustainable Agriculture. Over the past 10 years, Project Unnati has helped empower and enable nearly 4 lakh fruit farmers across 13 states and Union Territories in India. Focused on seven crop varieties Mango, Apple, Orange, Grapes, Litchi, Coffee, and sugarcane, the program is\naimed at propelling the horticulture supply chain and building agriculture production capacities across the country.",

All humans and dogs are welcome. “It’s a way to extend our hospitality,” said Jana Sax, co-chair of the West Stockbridge Dog Park Committee. “We are very intent upon making this a lovely addition to the town,\" Sax added as she hiked with her dogs, Diego, a wire haired pointing griffon, and Frida, a terrier mix on Thursday morning. \"And a park that you would like to walk through and sit in.” Dog or no dog. This committee of volunteers is currently working with [Berkshire Design Group](https://www.berkshiredesign.com/), a Northampton-based firm landscape architecture and engineering firm that has designed numerous dog parks, including at Burbank Park in Pittsfield. Committee members will be at the West Stockbridge Farmers Market on Thursday afternoon, as well as at the Zucchini Festival on Aug. 10, to spread the word in hopes of gathering support and more volunteers. After the committee breaks ground on construction in early 2025, it should take about one month to finish the job, Sax said. The project is on a timeline tied to a $275,000 grant the committee secured from [Stanton Foundation.](https://thestantonfoundation.org/canine-welfare/dog-parks) The New York City-based charity was established by Dr. Frank Stanton, a former longtime president of CBS News. The foundation gives grants for nuclear security and protection of First Amendment rights — and canine health and welfare, according to the foundation's website. “The Foundation’s support for canine welfare includes research, traditional grant-making and direct service programs to promote the welfare of dogs and strengthen the human/dog bond,” the website says. The committee learned that the foundation, in December 2023, would end its grantmaking program for dog parks in Massachusetts. So the volunteers rushed to apply. The committee also received a $25,000 mix of state and local money from the town’s Community Preservation Committee. Voters approved this in May. Soon, the committee will also establish a nonprofit, The Friends of West Stockbridge Dog Park, to fundraise. It now has a [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/weststockbridgedogpark) The park will require some clearing of a wooded area. Of the Stanton grant money, $25,000 will go toward design and $250,000 toward construction. The grant includes an extra $30,000 a year for three years for upkeep. The construction will involve adding ground cover, some walkways, fencing, signs, benches, handicap parking and plantings. A 1-acre slice will be devoted to large dogs, and three-fourth of an acre to the little dogs. But really it is a “social outlet for all species,” said Michael Bolognino, a full-time West Stockbridge resident [who restored a former rectory](https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/southern_berkshires/the-filomena-west-stockbridge-airbnb-conde-nast-traveler-berkshire-county-rentals/article_79a130e0-813c-11ec-8fa3-17e7808428c5.html) — known as The Filomena — in town with his husband. “I know that one thing I love about visiting dog parks is the people I meet there,” said Bolognino, who has Crouton, a miniature poodle/terrier mix, 11, and Lula, 3, a wirehaired pointing griffon. “When we travel I always find a local park, like in Provincetown, and it's there that I've gotten some of the best suggestions on things to do in the area, where to eat, et cetera.” Bolognino said he loves the solitude of parks, “In that I sometimes bring a book and hang out on a bench reading while the dogs do their thing.”",
