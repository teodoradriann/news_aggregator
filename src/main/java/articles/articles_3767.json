    "text": "Owed Tk17.78cr, received only Tk1.05cr: TNZ Group workers\nIf our dues are not paid before Eid, if necessary, we will go to the chief advisor to present our demands, they say\nHighlights\n- TNZ group owes workers Tk17.78 crore in wages & bonuses\n- Only Tk1.05 crore paid despite massive outstanding dues\n- Govt's statement on worker payments sparks confusion\n- 826 Apparel Eco Plus workers await unpaid salaries\n- Workers threaten to continue protesting if dues remain unpaid\n- TNZ workers may take their demands to the chief adviser before Eid\nWorkers of three ready-made garment factories owned by the TNZ Group today (28 March) said they are owed a staggering Tk17.78 crore in unpaid wages, bonuses and other allowances, but they were paid only Tk1.05 crore yesterday.\nThe workers broke down the amount of dues the owners owe them in a press statement issued after holding a press conference at the Shrom Bhaban this afternoon.\nThe press conference was held following an announcement last night, just hours after Labour and Employment Adviser M Sakhawat Hossain had said that disgruntled workers of TNZ Group were paid their dues by selling Apparel Eco Plus Ltd's factory cars.\nCondemning the adviser's announcement, the workers today said the workers of TNZ Apparels Ltd, Apparel Plus Eco Ltd and Apparel Art Ltd have been staying at the Shrom Bhaban for five days, hoping to get their unpaid dues.\n\"The workers have not slept, eaten, or bathed for 5 days now. The workers have run out of patience by sitting like this day after day. Our families are waiting for us. If we get our Eid salary bonus, we will go home and celebrate Eid,\" reads a press statement, signed by Md Shahidul Islam, Rekha Akhter Tinni and Md Shaheen Alam, on behalf of the TNZ Group workers.\nIn the statement, they disclosed the account of their dues.\nAccording to the statement, the workers of TNZ Apparels are owed over Tk6.94 crore in unpaid wages for February and March, and over Tk1.69 crore as Eid bonus.\nA total of 826 workers of Apparel Eco Plus were owed a total of Tk6.75 crore in unpaid salaries of January, February and March, Eid bonus, and other allowances.\nThey were paid a total of Tk1.05 crore yesterday, reads the press statement.\nMeanwhile, 240 workers of Apparel Art Ltd are owed a total of Tk2.04 crore in unpaid salaries for three months, Eid bonuses and other allowances.\nThe TNZ Group workers criticised the government for creating confusion over their dues.\n\"On the one hand, the government is terming the workers' protests as 'incitement', and on the other hand, the government is ignoring the peaceful movement day after day,\" the TNZ workers said.\n\"In this situation, if we do not receive our dues, including Eid bonus, we will continue our programme. If our dues are not paid before Eid, if necessary, we will go to the chief advisor to present our demands,\" they added.",

    "title": "This DIY Mini Air Hockey Table Runs Doom - Hackster.io",
    "text": "Go to any arcade and it should quickly become obvious that air hockey is one of the most popular games available. Something about the fast-paced, knuckle-bruising gameplay is irresistible to adults and children alike. And because air hockey tables are big and heavy, few people have the means to keep them at home. That’s why Downing built a miniature air hockey table to play with his kids. But he didn’t stop there, because his DIY mini air hockey table also runs Doom .\nThis air hockey table is fairly small at about three feet long and two feet wide. But it doesn’t lack features and includes everything you’d expect to see on a real air hockey table — and more.\nThe most important feature of an air hockey table to is the air cushion that helps the pucks skim along with very little friction. This works a bit like a hovercraft in reverse. Pumps inside the table push air through many holes in the table’s surface and that continuous flow lifts the puck. In this case, Downing used a pair of laptop-style blowers that are capable of providing a combined 80 CFM of air flow. Power comes from a PC ATX power supply.\nDowning works at a print shop and was able to use their CNC router to fabricate the table. That has an underlying composite aluminum support surface, an acrylic spacer for the LED lighting, a translucent acrylic top surface, and outer walls made of a skim-foam composite material called KömaCel. The scoreboard enclosure, its supports, and the goals were all 3D-printed.\nThis table contains both a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B single-board computer (SBC) and a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller development board. The Pico controls the LEDs, while the SBC feeds composite video to the two scoreboard screens. It also monitors infrared break beam sensors in the goals to detect the puck.\nBecause Downing included a Raspberry Pi SBC, he can run emulators to play games like Doom. That would have been interesting enough if it just displayed the graphics on the scoreboard screens. But Downing took it a step further and fed the composite video to the Pico so it could display those graphics on the table surface using the 600 embedded LEDs. The resolution is incredibly low, but it is fascinating to see bitmap sprites scaled down to just a few RGB LEDs.\nWe haven’t checked with Guinness, but we’re happy to assume that this is the first miniature air hockey table to run Doom.\ngames arcade blinky lights retro Cameron Coward Follow Writer for Hackster News.

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — First responders on Thursday were prepping for freezing precipitation, cautioning against getting frostbite.\nIndianapolis Department of Public Works had 80 snow trucks out Thursday evening to pretreat roads, bridges and overpass to get ahead of freezing temperatures.\nPublic Works spokesperson Auboni Hart says their crews are preventing water and snow from freezing into roads through 12-hour rotating shifts.\nOn Dec. 2, less than half an inch of snow led to more than 160 crashes around central Indiana. Public Works wants to prevent that. Hart recommended drivers drive slower than the posted speed limit, and to stock vehicles with water, additional clothing, blanket and phone chargers.\n“It’s important that you threat this like the weather event that it is, and go slow. Be cautious and take your time because your life matters.”\nNational Weather Service offices serving Indiana issued multiple winter storm watches from Saturday into Monday for a few inches of snow along with sleet and freezing rain.\nFor the anticipated weekend snowstorm, the Public Works team has prepped to focus on snow clearing. “If you’ve ever had to shovel your driveway while its snowing, that’s essentially what our crews will be doing is shoveling the the roads while its still continuing to come down.”\nAfter the snowstorm, temperatures are expected to drop to as low as 4 on Jan. 9, according to the Storm Track 8 seven-day forecast issued Thursday.\nDr. Tyler Stepsis, chief of emergency medicine at Eskenazi Health , has seen from 20-50 frostbite cases every winter. “Every inch of exposed skin can become frostbitten if exposed to the weather long enough. If it stays frozen long enough, those cells die and that’s when you see long-term effects from frostbite.”\nAt extreme cases, body parts would need to be amputated. Stepsis says early symptoms of frostbite include redness, prickly feelings, and throbbing. The doctor said, “If you try recovering and there’s a lot of pain still and you’re starting to notice blisters, that’s when its time to go to the hospital.”\nStepsis told News 8 that, even if temperatures are above freezing, it’s important to check the windchill. If that’s below freezing, bundle up areas where skin is exposed to prevent frostbite.",

    "text": "[log in](/login)or # to comment.\nI hate that schools basically teach students to over use classes for everything especially by using Java as a teaching language and then they get into the real world or grad school and we have to unteach them those terrible habits.\nI’m so glad a lot of the newer languages (Rust, Go, Zig, C3, V) don’t have classes in them at all.\nTbh if the average grad school student overused object oriented stuff they would produce vastly better code than the status quo.\nI’m currently taking the very last CS class my major requires. I can’t wait to leave OOP behind and focus on hardware completely.\nwhere do you plan to go to start that off after school?\nStrings are Objects, Doubles are Objects (that are than unboxed into primutives doubles)…\nYou did the right thing. OOP was invented by people who were worried about their job security, to obstruct others from understanding their code.\nOOP is pretty readable though. What would be the alternative, functional programming with no ORM?\nWell, bad code is bad code regardless of the paradigm. I’ve just had bad experiences rewriting some horrible OOP codebases and opted out to use as much functional style as C# allowed me to.\nThe main problem, as I see it, is that OOP encourages unnecessary abstractions and inheritance. These should be used as little as possible, because they typically increase complexity and make code harder to read and untangle. As an example, I’ve seen people define interfaces that don’t essentially define anything.\nAnother problem is that OOP encourages mutable member variables. It’s very annoying to try to understand code where class C inherits from class B that inherits from class C. Good luck debugging when the methods of C modify a variable declared in A in subtle ways.\nAs an idea OOP is very appealing. When I was younger, I would be thrilled to start designing a class hierarchy and interfaces when encountering a new programming challenge. Now I just try to think how to make things as simple and modular as possible.\nEdit: of course bad functional code is also bad code. It’s also very annoying to try to understand code where functions pass badly named functions around as parameters and use 10 function compositions in a sequence.\nRight, most things are a fine thing in moderation.\nObfuscation Oriented Programming as I call it\nGood, OOP can suck my balls\nBalls.suck() is the correct syntax.\nActually, it would be\nOOP.suck(ddplf.getBalls())\nDon’t you need to declare new Balls() first? Or do you suck() Balls static?\nBallsFactory ballsFactory = new BallsFactory(); ballsFactory.setSuckable(true); Balls balls = ballsFactory.create();\nAll of this is okay, but it’s not production ready. This is what real production code looks like:\nSuckableFactory suckableFactory = new SuckableFactory(); Suckable balls = suckableFactory .setShape(SuckableShapes.round) .setCount(2) .create(); SuctionProvider mouth = SuctionProvider.getInstance(); SuckerFactory suckerFactory = new SuckerFactory(); Sucker sucker = SuckerFactory.create(): sucker.setSuctionProvider(mouth); sucker.setSuckable(balls); sucker.setIntensity(SuckerSuctionIntensities.medium); sucker.suckSuckable();\nPython port:\nfrom ballsucker import suck suck()\nOr I didn’t using the correct naming convention!",
