    "title": "Treyarch Accidentally Reverts Black Ops 6 Assault Rifles’ Damage and Range Values to Launch State With Season 1 Patch",
    "text": "With today’s Season 1 launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, not only are players getting new maps, modes and weapons, but we’re also getting a load of weapon tuning adjustments on all weapon types. Now, for those playing the shooter and primarily use the Assault Rifles, you might have noticed some inconsistencies with your time-to-kill (TTK), how it feels like you need more bullets to kill an enemy than before, and more. If you are, well, you’ll be happy to hear that it’s not you nor has your skills degraded with one patch.\nApparently, Treyarch has accidentally reverted the Assault Rifle damage and range values to their original launch state rather than applying the Season 1 changes. Nope, I wish I was kidding, but I’m not. This was confirmed by YouTuber and Call of Duty stats guy TheXclusive Ace.\nBlack Ops 6 Assault Rifle Damage and Range Stats Are Back to Launch State Accidentally Due to the S1 Patch Over on Twitter, Ace made the announcement, which I’m assuming comes from his testing of the Assault Rifles to see how much they changed with the S1 patch applied. In response, Treyarch Associate Director of Design Matt Scronce tweeted that they are looking into it.\nTeams are looking into it.\n— Matt Scronce (@MaTtKs) November 14, 2024\nSadly, this is not the only issue that has surfaced with today’s massive seasonal content drop. The Ghost perk appears locked for players even if they’ve hit the required level of 17. For now, Treyarch has it marked on their Trello board as something they’re investigating.\nOver on TheXclusive Ace’s video about the Season changes, he left the following message pinned to let the community know what’s happening, stating, “HEADS UP: At the moment, all of the Assault Rifles are bugged. Most have reverted to their launch values for damage and range and some, like the AMES 85 are even worse off. This means, the information I share in this video for ARs is not currently working as they intended for Season 1. Treyarch has confirmed that they’re looking into it so I suspect they should be able to get on top of this issue fairly quickly (I’ll delete this comment once they fix the issue). All of the other classes of weapons appear to be working as intended with the Season 1 values.”\nFor those feeling like it takes way longer to down someone in multiplayer, well, now you know. Just maybe avoid the assault rifles until Treyarch patches this, lest you like playing with a slight handicap.\nChances are, we’ll be getting a patch very soon to address this and the Ghost perk issue, and once we know more about that, we’ll let our readers know.",

[PTI](/pti-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 05-05-2024 14:22 IST | Created: 05-05-2024 14:22 IST - Country: - India India will never give up its claim on Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK) but it won't have to capture it with force because its people, on their own, would want to be part of India after seeing the development in Kashmir, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has said. In an exclusive interview to PTI, Singh asserted that the ground situation has improved significantly in Jammu and Kashmir and that a time will come when AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) will no longer be required in the Union Territory. The defence minister, however, said the matter is under the domain of the Union Home Ministry and it will take appropriate decisions. He said elections will also be held there definitely, but wouldn't give a timeline. ''I think India will not have to do anything. The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India,'' he said. ''We will not have to use force to take PoK as people would say that we must be merged with India. Such demands are now coming,'' he said. The defence minister asserted that ''PoK was, is, and will remain ours''. Citing improvement in the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said assembly elections will be held there soon, but did not give a timeline. ''The way the situation is improving in Jammu and Kashmir, I think a time will come when AFSPA will no longer be required there. It is my view and it is for the Home Ministry to decide on it,'' he said. The AFSPA empowers security forces to conduct operations and arrest anyone without any prior warrant. It also gives immunity to the forces if they shoot someone dead. The defence minister, referring to Pakistan's proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, said Islamabad must stop cross border terrorism. ''They are trying to destabilise India and we will not allow it to happen,'' he said. Singh asserted that India will keep focusing on combating cross-border terrorism. The ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after India's warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan in February 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack. The relations further deteriorated after India on August 5, 2019 announced the withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories. India has been maintaining that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan while insisting that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility for such an engagement. In the last few years, India has been following a policy of ''hot pursuit'' in dealing with terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.
