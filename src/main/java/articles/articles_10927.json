    "title": "Ronan Hale knocks out Coleraine with extra-time hat-trick – The Irish News",
    "text": "Ronan Hale was the hat-trick hero as he grabbed all three of his side’s goals in a flattering 3-0 victory over a dejected Coleraine in the fifth-round of the Clearer Water Irish Cup tie at the Showgrounds. All three goals came in extra-time, after a goal-less 90 minutes, that saw both sides lose a man each to a red card. The defeat heaps more misery on under-pressure manager Oran Kearney whose Coleraine side exited the Irish Cup at this stage for only the third time in 16 years. With new signings Jack Scott and Rory Brown starting for the Bannsiders, hopes were high of a turn of fortune for a side on the back of four straight defeats. However, it was the side from Solitude that had the opening chance of the game after only five minutes. Ben Wilson got the better of Dean Jarvis down Coleraine’s left and whipped an inviting ball across the front of goal, where Sean Stewart raced in from the opposite flank, but he failed to hit the target with the goal at his mercy. The first period was an open affair with both sides showing some attacking intent, however it was the away side that looked the more likely to score; that was until the half-hour mark when the hosts had a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock. A misplaced pass out of defence from Mr.Reliable Johnny Addis arrived at the feet of Jamie Glackin, who picked out Lee Lynch, who in turn tried to pick out the on-rushing Scott. But his pass was a poor one and the debutant couldn’t get on the end of the ball as the score remained goal-less and that’s the way it stayed until the break. Jim Magilton’s visitors started the second period on top but failed to work goalkeeper Brown in the Coleraine goal, as both sides became less prepared to take risks as the half progressed. As the game petered out towards extra-time, it was the production of cards from referee Raymond Crangle, rather than goals that would make headlines. With 10 minutes on the clock, Reds substitute Sam Ashford was shown a straight red card after a high challenge on Dean Jarvis. He was swiftly followed by Coleraine player Lyndon Kane, on his 300th club appearance, for his second-yellow card for a follow-through tackle that seemed harsh, as neither side could find a winner in 90 minutes. After a tetchy start to extra-time, on 95 minutes, Rory Hale thought he had broken the deadlock. Ben Wilson with a smart lay-off to the incoming midfielder, who smashed an effort form 20 yards, but it was expertly saved by Brown in goal at full stretch to his left. However, it was his brother Ronan who did open the scoring nine minutes later. The striker scored his sixth goal in six games with a stunning curling effort into the top right-hand corner of the Coleraine net from just outside the area, giving Brown no chance this time. As Coleraine pushed for an equaliser, Ronan Hale grabbed his second of the night four minutes from time to send the Reds through. A smart turn inside the box and a cool finish broke Coleraine hearts. However, the younger Hale wasn’t done there, and within thirty seconds had his hat-trick. A through ball from midfield beat the Coleraine offside trap, and there was Hale with all the time in the world to beat Brown and slot home for a memorable victory. Coleraine: Brown, Kane (capt), D.

    "title": "Cult of Klan, Christ, Yahweh, and Trump: By God, Let's Stop It",
    "text": "To tweak (and perhaps burnish) Lord Acton: Almighty power corrupts absolutely. For several decades and counting, God’s Own Party (GOP) has had its cake and eaten the known universe. If that sounds overblown, let’s look. As the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Morris Dees (Hate on Trial, A Lawyer’s Journey) reveals, the once-proud “Party of Lincoln” now shares common, blood-soaked ground with the longtime Cross-flaunting, pro-GOP Ku Klux Klan- and with the underreported, un-American Aryan Nations. Don’t look now, but the Proudly Boyish Republican clan now openly touts Adolf Hitler. And bust my buttons! As God is my witness, so does Trump chum Nick “I LOVE HITLER!” Fuentes. According to Mother Jones’s Kiera Butler’s firsthand account (“My Deeply Unsettling Return to the Moms for Liberty Conference,” 7/6/23), so has MFL co-founder Tiffany Justice. Not to mention the self-styled “Chosen One” Himself- who echoes, with evident impunity, the Fuhrer’s wails for “vengeance” on “vermin,” while effectively howling for a “bloodbath” that he suggests would culminate in President Biden’s execution. Talk about conflicted. On one hand, rabid tuskers effectively (and often overtly) endorse such fascism-writ-large. On the other hand- never mind the Aryan Nations’, the Klan’s, und der Fuhrer’s animus toward Jews- the GOP styles itself, in effect, as the champion (if not the avatar) of Yahweh. (Go figure.) Be it resolved: history repeats. In 1980, the KKK cheered Ronald ‘The Neshoba Firebrand’ Reagan. In 2016, it feted the parental pelf-made swell who’d been flagged by the DOJ (in 1973) for race-based housing discrimination. As ever, what we don’t know can hurt us. Growing up, I had no clue that, in 1885, within screaming distance of the future site of my home (in Towson, Maryland), some Klannish thugs had imposed (you guessed it) trial by fire-and-rope. (Sweeping such stuff under the rug, while eternally idolizing Reagan- who, in 1971, smeared some African UN delegates as “monkeys”- what could possibly go wrong?) Granted, our domestic terrorists have slain far more African American Christians than they have Jews. Still, last time I checked, neither the American Klan nor the German Reich was well-disposed to the latter. To memory-hole the former’s violent anti-Semitism (as Big News has done) can’t help but tend to normalize-and-enable the creeping, violent, America-scourging tyranny we now see around us. Or to which we turn blind eyes. Better late than never, Dems need to face the fact that, through time, the conventional wisdom has given the Gipper’s and then Big Blonder’s cult carte blanche to wage “holy war” (quoting Jerry Falwell) six ways to Sunday. All while battling, in a sense, from BOTH SIDES: that is, as purportedly pro-Jewry, while still (now far from subtly) pro-Nazi. In other words, (re the latter), pro-snake. (For a motto, the GOP could aptly deploy Lady Macbeth’s advice to her seditious spouse: “Look like the innocent flower/ But be the serpent under it.”) At bottom, for roughly 45 years, the so-called “liberal media” have fundamentally equated “the religious right” with religion, period. Predictably enough, not unlike the titular horror in the late Baltimorean Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit,” our body politic now hangs in the balance. To stress what should be obvious: let NO person or party get off scot free while spouting pro-Nazi screed. Let those who foist such flagrant evil on our great country be smitten harshly at the polls- and, to the fullest extent of the law, face punishment (for God’s sake, amen).",
