The reason for this is intelligence information that indicates a possible threat, said a spokesman. All employees who are not required for the mission have been sent home as a precautionary measure. “The safety of our employees is our top priority. Operations are continuing as planned,” wrote the Awacs association on social media platform X.\n“A purely precautionary measure” “This is not a cause for concern and is purely a precautionary measure to ensure that we can continue our critical operations,” the base’s spokesman said. He did not provide any details. The police confirmed that they were on duty. They also did not provide any details, including the number of officers deployed.\nThe military alliance’s AWACS aircraft are stationed in Geilenkirchen near Aachen.

NATO has 14 of these converted Boeing 707 aircraft.\nThe airborne early warning systems are also regularly deployed on the eastern border of the alliance territory near Russia and Ukraine.\nAWACS aircraft are of central importance for NATO’s early detection and reconnaissance.\nNot the first suspected case Around a week ago, there were fears of sabotage at several Bundeswehr locations. Suspicious observations were also made in Geilenkirchen. According to information from security circles, a person in the vicinity of the airport was taken into custody for questioning, but the suspicion was not confirmed.\nImportance of NATO’s Geilenkirchen Base The NATO base in Geilenkirchen plays a crucial role in the alliance’s defense strategy. Its central functions include:\nAir and maritime surveillance to identify threats early. Coordination of joint operations in crises. Real-time intelligence sharing among NATO allies. Why Are Awacs Bases Key for NATO? The AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft are equipped with advanced radar and sensor technology that allows for extensive monitoring and reconnaissance capabilities. This makes them invaluable for ensuring the safety of NATO airspace, especially in areas of heightened tension like Eastern Europe.\nFeature Description Radar Range Can detect and track airborne objects at distances exceeding 400 km. Deployment Time Quick response capability, ready for take-off in minutes during alerts. Mission Versatility Support for ground forces, naval units, and air operations simultaneously. Recent Developments and Global Context The alert at the Geilenkirchen base reflects a broader trend of increasing vigilance among NATO forces in response to global security threats. These measures are taken seriously given the current geopolitical climate, with rising tensions in Eastern Europe and periodic threats from state and non-state actors. Therefore, maintaining readiness and response frameworks is essential for NATO’s operational effectiveness.\nRisk Factors and Security Challenges Security challenges faced by NATO installations may include:\nCyber attacks targeted at communication and operational systems. Physical threats from unauthorized access or sabotage. Intelligence gathering by hostile entities. Conclusion The ongoing situation at the Geilenkirchen NATO base underscores the critical need for heightened security in military operations. Understanding the implications of these security measures helps provide clarity on NATO’s readiness and commitment to safeguarding allied territories in an increasingly volatile global landscape.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "El musical de Jacques Audiard destaca en los Oscar 2025, con menciones a Mejor Película, Mejor Dirección, Mejor Actriz (Karla Sofía Gascón) y Mejor Actriz de Reparto (Zoe Saldaña).\nEmilia Pérez continúa rompiendo barreras en esta temporada de premios. Este jueves, la Academia de Hollywood dio a conocer a los nominados a los Oscar 2025 y, tal como se esperaba, el musical dirigido por el francés Jacques Audiard dominó con 13 menciones, entre ellas las tan codiciadas de Mejor Película y Mejor Director.\n► Oscar 2025: estos son los nominados a los premios de la Academia de Hollywood\nLa película, que sigue a una exnarcotraficante trans en México, ha conquistado a la crítica, aunque no ha tenido el mismo impacto con el público. A pesar de esto, se llevó nominaciones para Karla Sofía Gascón en Mejor Actriz y Zoe Saldaña en Mejor Actriz de Reparto. Además, obtuvo menciones en Guion Adaptado, Sonido, Banda Sonora Original, Maquillaje y Peluquería, Edición y Fotografía.\nLa cinta también consiguió dos nominaciones en la categoría de Mejor Canción Original, por El Mal (recientemente ganadora del Globo de Oro en la misma categoría) y Mi Camino.\nSin embargo, es la nominación a Mejor Película Internacional la que marcó un récord histórico, convirtiéndola a Emilia Pérez en la película en lengua no inglesa con más nominaciones al Oscar, superando las 10 obtenidas por Roma de Alfonso Cuarón en 2018.\nKarla Sofía Gascón hace historia en el Oscar\nPor otro lado, Gascón competirá en la categoría de Mejor Actriz contra Cynthia Erivo (Wicked), Mikey Madison (Anora), Demi Moore (La sustancia) y Fernanda Torres (Aún sigo aquí). Aunque la competencia es feroz, Gascón se siente optimista tras haber ganado el Globo de Oro por su actuación a principios de este mes.\nEntre aplausos y gritos, Karla Sofía celebró su histórica nominación al Oscar 2025. La actriz española hizo historia al convertirse en la primera mujer trans nominada al galardón, mientras espera los resultados de sus nominaciones en los BAFTA, Critics Choice y SAG.\n¿De qué trata Emilia Pérez?\nEn una mezcla de suspenso, comedia y drama, Emilia Pérez utiliza números musicales para abordar temas sociales profundos, como el activismo trans, los feminicidios, el narcotráfico, la corrupción y los desaparecidos en México.\nLa historia sigue a Rita, una abogada exitosa cuya vida da un giro inesperado cuando recibe una propuesta que nunca imaginó: ayudar al líder de un cartel a retirarse del crimen y desaparecer para siempre. En el proceso, Rita tiene la oportunidad de convertirse finalmente en la mujer con la que siempre soñó ser.\n¿Cuándo es la entrega de los Oscar 2025?\nLa ceremonia de los Premios Oscar 2025, organizada por la Academia de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas, se celebrará el domingo 2 de marzo. Este año, el evento contará con la conducción del comediante Conan O'Brien, quien debutará como anfitrión.\nComparte esta noticia",

    "text": "(OSV News) — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed suit in an attempt to shut down a Catholic nonprofit in El Paso serving migrants and asylum-seekers, accusing it of “human smuggling,” in a move denounced by Catholic immigration advocates, including El Paso Bishop Mark J. Seitz. “We’re taking some hits right now, you know, right to the gut on our work,” Bishop Seitz said during a Feb. 21 webinar about humane solutions for the U.S.-Mexico border hosted by the Center for Migration Studies of New York. “There’s an effort in the country to demonize the work of charity that we’re doing, as well as the search for justice. But know that we are not alone. The Lord is on our side. Don’t give up hope.” Paxton’s suit targeting El Paso’s Annunciation House comes as some Republicans have grown increasingly hostile toward nongovernmental organizations, including Catholic ones, that provide resources such as food and shelter to migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Annunciation House operates several shelters in the El Paso area, assisting migrants and refugees with food, housing and other assistance, as well as information about how to fill out the required legal documents to claim asylum in the United States. Paxton’s office said Annunciation House’s efforts amount to “facilitating illegal entry to the United States” and “human smuggling.” “The chaos at the southern border has created an environment where NGOs, funded with taxpayer money from the Biden Administration, facilitate astonishing horrors including human smuggling,” Paxton said in a statement. “While the federal government perpetuates the lawlessness destroying this country, my office works day in and day out to hold these organizations responsible for worsening illegal immigration.” In a press statement, Annunciation House said the attorney general came to the facility “on February 7, 2024 stating that the organization had one day to turn over a broad swath of records to the Attorney General without an explanation.” “Annunciation House asked a Court to decide what documents the law permits the Attorney General to access,” the Feb. 21 statement said. “There is nothing illegal about asking a Court to decide a person’s rights.” The group said Paxton “has now made explicit that its real goal is not records but to shut down the organization,” and that he “considers it a crime for a Catholic organization to provide shelter to refugees.” “The Attorney General’s illegal, immoral and anti-faith position to shut down Annunciation House is unfounded,” the statement said. “Annunciation House has provided hospitality to hundreds of thousands of refugees for over forty-six years. It is a work recognized by the Catholic Church and is listed in the National Catholic Directory. “Annunciation House has done this work of accompaniment out of the scriptural and Gospel mandate to welcome the stranger,” it continued. “Annunciation House’s response to the stranger is no different from that of the schools who enroll children of refugees, the clinics and hospitals who care for the needs of refugees, and the churches, synagogues, and mosques who welcome families to join in worship.” Annunciation House also argued that its work “is central to the City of El Paso.” “El Paso has made it a point of pride to provide humane support for people coming through our community in need,” it said. “Annunciation House has kept hundreds of thousands of refugees coming through our city off the streets and given them food. The work helps serve our local businesses, our City, and immigration officials to keep people off the streets and give them a shelter while they come through our community.” The group added, “If the work that Annunciation House conducts is illegal — so too is the work of our local hospitals, schools, and food banks.” In a Feb. 22 statement, Bishop Seitz said, “Let me be clear. For the church’s part, we will endeavor to work with all in pursuit of the common good of our city and nation.” “We will vigorously defend the freedom of people of faith and goodwill to put deeply held religious convictions into practice,” Bishop Seitz said. “We will not be intimidated in our work to serve Jesus Christ in our sisters and brothers fleeing danger and seeking to keep their families together. We will stand in solidarity with our communities, aid workers and volunteers, with our community nonprofits assisting migrants, as well as with all those in the Borderlands and throughout our state living under the weight of inhumane immigration policies.” Bishop Seitz, who also is the U.S. bishops’ migration committee chair, added in his statement that El Paso has worked to foster a welcoming community, but “today, however, we find ourselves in an impossible position hemmed in on all sides.” “On the one hand, we are challenged by serious federal neglect to provide a safe, orderly and humane response to migration at our southern border,” he said. “On the other hand, we are now witnessing an escalating campaign of intimidation, fear and dehumanization in the state of Texas, one characterized by barbed wire, harsh new laws penalizing the act of seeking safety at our border, and targeting those who would offer aid as a response of faith.” Since its beginnings in 1976, Annunciation House “has been an effective, compassionate, local response to a complex and broken immigration system, rooted in the Gospel and born of an encounter between (founder and director) Ruben Garcia and Mother Teresa of Kolkata,” Bishop Seitz said. “It has led our community effort to meet the challenge of migration in recent years. Its work is nourished by long-standing partnerships with the Catholic Church and El Paso, our local government and our federal law enforcement partners, including U.S. Border Patrol,” the prelate said. “Its work is an example of our Catholic commitment to the poor, the Christian call to love one’s neighbor and stepping into the breach to take action where many will not. Our church, our city and our country owe Annunciation House a deep debt of gratitude.” At the Feb. 21 webinar, panelists joined Bishop Seitz in condemning Paxton’s effort to shut down Annunciation House. Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, said “faith-based organizations in particular have been picking up the pieces of a broken system for decades.” Paxton’s effort, Corbett said, is “a threat.” “This is a shot across the bow,” he said. “It’s an action designed for political effect. It’s an action designed to have a chilling effect.” J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said at the webinar that Paxton was “shameless.” “The Catholic church organizations coordinate with the federal government, help the federal government do their job, responding to migrants who cross the border,” Appleby said. “They’re not the enemy. And to go down this road can start persecuting faith-based organizations in order to make political points is wrongheaded. We’ve seen this throughout history, where you know, Catholics, Christians, Jews, Muslims, all faiths have served their mission in assisting others who were in need. And to attack that for political points is just shameful.” Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, who represents a district that includes El Paso, issued a statement calling Annunciation House a “critical faith-based partner” and Paxton’s effort “outrageous.” “If Mr. Paxton believes that Annunciation House merits investigation, he should apply that same standard to Gov. Greg Abbott, who has literally transported a similar population across state lines,” Escobar said in reference to the Republican governor’s record of busing migrants to Democratic-led jurisdictions.",

    "text": "Por Doha Madani – [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lays-classic-potato-chips-recalled-life-threatening-allergy-risk-rcna184869)\nFrito-Lay retiró del mercado una de sus patatas fritas más populares por contener leche que no fue declarada en la etiqueta, indicó la [Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/frito-lay-issues-limited-recall-undeclared-milk-lays-classic-potato-chips-distributed-oregon-and) (FDA, en inglés).\nLas Lay’s Classic Potato Chips, que los compradores pueden reconocer por su familiar bolsa de color amarillo fluorescente, están siendo retiradas en Oregon y Washington, informó la FDA el miércoles. No está claro dónde se produjo la contaminación con leche, ya que los ingredientes de las papas fritas son patatas, aceite vegetal y sal.\n\"Las personas alérgicas o con sensibilidad grave a la leche corren el riesgo de sufrir una reacción alérgica grave o potencialmente mortal si consumen el producto retirado\", señaló el aviso de retirada.\nEl producto retirado es la bolsa de 13 onzas con fecha de caducidad garantizada del 11 de febrero de 2025 y códigos de fabricación 6462307xx o 6463307xx.\n[[Retiran casi 500,000 cargadores de baterías vendidos en Amazon por riesgo de incendio y quemaduras]](https://www.telemundo.com/noticias/noticias-telemundo/estados-unidos/retiran-casi-500000-cargadores-baterias-amazon-incendio-quemaduras-rcna184946)\nNo han sido reportadas reacciones alérgicas debido a la presencia de la leche, y la empresa afirmó que ninguno de sus otros sabores de papas fritas han sido afectados.\nSe recomienda a los consumidores de los dos estados que desechen las bolsas y se pongan en contacto con el departamento de Relaciones con el Consumidor de Frito-Lay.",
