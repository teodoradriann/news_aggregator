L’esame dei dati rileva che, sebbene la prima decade abbia registrato temperature leggermente al di sotto della media, la seconda e la terza decade hanno visto un significativo aumento, con valori nettamente superiori alla norma. In particolare, il 23 dicembre, forti venti di foehn hanno contribuito a stabilire temperature massime record in alcune località della regione.\nGuardando all’intero anno trascorso, emerge che il 2023 ha seguito le orme del 2022, confermandosi anch’esso come un periodo caratterizzato da temperature elevate. Le precipitazioni hanno superato la media, segnando la fine di un prolungato periodo di siccità iniziato alla fine del 2021 e protrattosi fino ai primi mesi del 2023.

    "title": "Three Years After Coup, Myanmar Crisis In ‘Freefall’ – Eurasia Review",
    "text": "Three Years After Coup, Myanmar Crisis In ‘Freefall’ By [RFA](https://www.eurasiareview.com/author/rfa/) Myanmar’s coup and ensuing civil war – now entering its fourth year – have torn apart Phyo Phyo Aung’s family. Her husband Lin Htet Naing – a longtime activist also known as Ko James – is in Yangon’s notorious Insein Prison, where inmates are routinely tortured. He was sentenced to eight years for protesting against the military junta’s takeover on Feb. 1, 2021. Some 16 months ago, 36-year-old Ko James’ mother was [killed in a bomb blast while waiting to visit him at the prison](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/prison-blasts-10192022172521.html) – an attack that an anti-junta group claimed responsibility for. Since then, Phyo Phyo Aung, 35, and her two young sons have fled Myanmar, where they get little news about Ko James’ fate – and yet she hasn’t given up hope that the junta will collapse. “We will never accept the military coup. We will never accept military rule,” she told RFA from an undisclosed location. As Myanmar’s bloody conflict drags into its fourth year, the fighting has taken an enormous toll on civilians like Phyo Phyo Aung’s family – including children. More than 2.6 million people have been displaced, the United Nations says, and at least 4,423 civilians have been killed since the coup – nearly doubling the 2,826 deaths during the first two years, according to Thailand’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma). Some 459 of the dead were minors, up from 265 at the end of February last year, the group said, and 159 of them were under the age of 10. Earlier this week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned that Myanmar’s human rights crisis is now in “freefall,” noting that the abuses had “deteriorated even further” in recent months as the military has grown desperate amid a series of battlefield defeats. Turning point? Those rebel advances have put the military on its heels and suggest that the conflict may be at a turning point. Since the end of October, the Three Brotherhood Alliance – a coalition of three ethnic armies in Shan and Rakhine states – has made rapid advances in the western and northern parts of the country, seizing control of more than 200 military camps, capturing 15 cities and prompting the surrender of about 4,000 junta troops, including a number of officers. In November, junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said the rebel offensive [could “break the country into pieces.”](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/pieces-11092023161935.html) The success of “Operation 1027,” named for its Oct. 27 start date, is presenting “an existential threat” to the military, said Jason Tower, the Burma country director at the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace. The defeats and large-scale surrenders of hundreds of troops at a time have led the military to “lose any legitimacy that it might have ever had within the ranks of its own people,” Tower said. The junta has responded with devastating raids on villages that include the use of airstrikes and heavy artillery. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, said that more than 554 civilians have been killed since October alone. The military also continued to use arson in raids on villages and towns during its third year in power. Junta troops have torched nearly 79,000 houses across the country, according to Data for Myanmar, an independent research firm that tracks the impact of conflict on civilians. “Pitched battles between the military and armed opposition groups have resulted in mass displacement and civilian casualties,” the U.N.’s Turk said in a statement ahead of the third anniversary of the takeover. “As the military have suffered setback after setback on the battlefield, they have lashed out, launching waves of indiscriminate aerial bombardments and artillery strikes.” No criticism allowed As in the case of Phyo Phyo Aung and her family, the junta has also stepped up its response to any criticism of its rule. Since the 2021 coup, junta authorities have arrested nearly 26,000 people on political grounds – of whom almost 20,000 remain in detention, where they face torture and few legal protections. In several cases where activists have evaded arrest, the military has detained relatives to use as leverage. The OHCHR says at least 1,576 people have died in military custody over the past three years. The military regime failed to hold elections in 2023 as planned as its control of the country slipped. Opponents had dismissed the planned election as a [sham](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/law-01302023131751.html) because it appeared likely to exclude parties ousted from power by the coup. A fifth extension of emergency rule announced Wednesday would postpone the election. Myanmar’s Constitution mandates must be held within six months after a state of emergency is lifted. In the meantime, experts say, junta mismanagement has [decimated the economy](https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/malaysia-economy-09022023094607.html), the value of the kyat has plummeted, and foreign investors have fled the country. In April, the junta announced that it had [increased military spending](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-junta-increases-military-budget-to-us2-7-billion.html)to 5.6 trillion kyats (US$2.7 billion), or more than one-quarter of the 20 trillion kyats (US$9.5 billion) allocated to the overall budget, for the 2023-2024 fiscal year, up from 3.7 trillion kyats (US$1.7 billion) a year earlier. By comparison, 2 trillion kyats were allocated for education (US$953 million) and just over 800 billion kyats (US$381 million) for health, while around 680 billion kyats (US$324 million) were earmarked for electricity, despite Myanmar’s power grid suffering regular power cuts and calls by the junta for the public to save energy and fuel. Turk, the U.N. rights czar, urged member states to consider imposing further targeted sanctions on the military to “constrain their ability to commit serious violations and disregard international law,” by limiting access to weapons, jet fuel, and foreign currency. To that end, on Wednesday the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against four individuals and two entities it said are linked to the military regime, to add to its growing list, while the Australian government imposed additional sanctions on two banks it said enabled the junta’s activities and three firms that supply it with jet fuel. Fighting for democracy For Phyo Phyo Aung, three years of military rule is three years too long. She told RFA that a return to civilian government can’t come soon enough and vowed to keep fighting until the junta is removed from power. She and Ko James have been activists going back to their youth and have been jailed several times and are accustomed to living in hiding. They met in 2005 as teenagers and later became members of the prominent All Burma Federation of Student Unions. After joining the 2007 monk-led Saffron Revolution for democracy, the then-junta issued warrants for their arrests and they were forced to go into hiding. The following year, Cyclone Nargis devastated the country and they were jailed while taking part in student-led relief efforts. In 2015, they were again jailed for their role in protests of the National Education Law approved by Thein Sein’s quasi-military government. After the 2021 coup, they were involved in anti-junta protests. Living in hiding in Yangon, authorities arrested Ko James and one of their two young sons on June 18, 2022. Authorities tried to use the child as bait to get Phyo Phyo Aung to turn herself in, but she refused – and the child was released about a day later, to her great relief. Now in hiding in a safe, undisclosed location with her two boys, Phyo Phyo Aung says she needs to keep a low profile for their safety. “We cannot live our lives conspicuously.” She worries about her husband, but is deeply proud: “He is a defender of democracy no matter which government is in power.”",

People everywhere must continue to declare that there can be no Christmas as usual during a genocide!”\nPosts on social media appeared to show large pro-Palestinian protests in cities like New York City, Chicago, London, Los Angeles and Toronto. In one clip, protesters in New York City appeared to be chanting, “While you’re shopping, bombs are dropping.”\nHealth officials in Gaza said that over 20,000 people have been killed in the territory during the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas Friday. The war, which began Oct. 7 with an attack by Hamas on Israel that killed 1,200 Israelis, is about to come up on the three-month mark.\nOn Friday, The United Nations (U.N.) Security Council passed a resolution stepping up aid to Gaza that also called for the quick release of hostages currently held by Hamas. Despite thirteen countries voting for the resolution, the U.S. and Russia abstained.\n“Colleagues, today this council made clear that addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza needs to remain at the forefront of our agenda,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said following the vote.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

    "text": "Table of Contents\nToggle\nIntroduction of Women’s Teams in Major Competitions Teams and Structure Investment and Development Plans for Future Seasons Comments from Cricket Officials Introduction of Women’s Teams in Major Competitions\nEight new women’s professional cricket teams are set to participate in the T20 Blast and One-Day Cup starting next season, marking a significant step towards aligning women’s sports more closely with their male counterparts.\nTeams and Structure The teams included in this initiative are Durham, Essex, Hampshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset, Surrey, and Warwickshire. These teams were granted Tier 1 status by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) earlier this year as part of a comprehensive restructure of women’s domestic cricket planned for 2025. Each team will compete under their respective county identities, with the exception of the Trent Bridge team, which will retain the name The Blaze.\nFor the T20 Blast, Warwickshire will adopt the name Birmingham Bears, mirroring their men’s team branding, while Lancashire will be referred to as Lancashire Thunder.\nInvestment and Development The ECB has announced that this new professional framework will inject £8 million annually into women’s domestic cricket until 2027, raising total funding in this sector to £19 million per year. This financial boost aims to potentially increase the number of professional female cricketers in England and Wales by 80% by 2029.\nAdditionally, the structure will feature a knockout cup competition that incorporates teams from all three tiers of the newly expanded women’s domestic framework. This competition is designed to allow all counties to face off against each other, compete at prestigious venues, and provide players with valuable exposure.\nPlans for Future Seasons The upcoming season is anticipated to include several double-header events, where both women’s and men’s teams will play on the same day. This restructuring signifies a departure from the regional format that has prevailed in recent years, effectively phasing out the Charlotte Edwards Cup and the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy after the current summer.\nComments from Cricket Officials Beth Barrett-Wild, the director of the women’s professional game, stated, “A big driver for the reorganisation has been to enable us to better use the leverage and existing scale of men’s county cricket to accelerate fanbase growth for our women’s teams and players.” She further added, “As we have seen through The Hundred and alignment of our England Men’s and England Women’s teams, we believe that by putting our men’s and women’s competitions and players on the same platform we can exponentially increase the reach of the women’s domestic game and intensify the depth of feeling fans have for our women’s teams moving forwards.”",

The visit, at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, is \"a renewal of all the excellent relations of cooperation and friendship\" between the two countries, said Munshi Faiz Ahmad, Bangladesh's former ambassador to China. Ahmad stressed the significance of Hasina's visit, her first to China since her new term began in January, and five years after her last visit to the country, saying Bangladesh's cooperation and friendship with China are continuously improving. \" (Bangladesh-China) cooperation has always been based on mutual benefit, mutual respect and mutual trust,\" Ahmad said. \"When countries in the region continue to prosper and do well, it is always a positive thing for regional peace and stability.\" Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, said the Bangladesh-China relationship \"is one of our defining partnerships\". In the 49 years since establishing diplomatic ties, China and Bangladesh have achieved significant cooperation in various fields. China has been Bangladesh's biggest trading partner for 13 consecutive years, and as of last year, Chinese investments in Bangladesh totaled $3.2 billion, ranking China as the country's second-largest source of foreign investment. According to the Chinese embassy, nearly 1,000 Chinese companies operate in Bangladesh, creating more than 550,000 job opportunities. Bangladesh is keen to attract Chinese investment, Rahman said, adding that he believes a special economic zone for Chinese investors and a free-trade agreement between the two countries will be conducive to Bangladesh's economy. In 2016, Bangladesh was the first country in South Asia to join China's Belt and Road Initiative. Rahman said Bangladesh is also interested in key projects such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, investment and trade and technology transfer. Shahab Enam Khan, a professor of the Department of International Relations at the Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka, said not only will Bangladesh profit from Chinese investment, but other regional countries will also benefit from the shared economic effect and infrastructure connectivity. \"The Bangladesh-China relationship should not be seen through the myopic prism of geopolitics,\" Khan said. \"It should be seen through the prism of development and growth of the 170 million population in Bangladesh.\" People who criticize Bangladesh for falling into the \"debt trap\" of China need to see Bangladesh's growth momentum, Khan said. Bilateral relationship will continue to grow because of common economic and market interests, Khan added. Abdus Salam Aref, president of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh, said he hopes to see more investment from China in the tourism sector. In May, ATAB co-organized a \"China Tourism Day\" promotion event. Aref said an increasing number of people in Bangladesh are becoming more interested in traveling to China. During Hasina's visit, the two countries agreed to designate next year as the \"China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People Exchanges\". Aref said people-to-people exchanges between Bangladesh and China will further grow with improved connectivity and more business cooperation.",
