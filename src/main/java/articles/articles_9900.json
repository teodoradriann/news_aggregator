    "text": "Higher govt spend & investment set stage for 7.3 pc growth in FY24\nINDIA’S GROSS Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow 7.3 per cent in 2023-24, according to the first advance estimates of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) Friday.\nThe 7 per cent-plus growth rate in FY24 — the third year in a row, and in the backdrop of poor global conditions and a slowing down of the world economy — comes ahead of national elections likely to be held in a few months from now.\nThe first advance estimates of growth is marginally up from 7.2 per cent in 2022-23, but way higher than the government’s initial growth estimate of 6.5 per cent.\nHigher investment coupled with government expenditure along with a pickup in sectoral outputs of mining, manufacturing, construction and financial services, are seen supporting the higher GDP growth. Agriculture and trade, hotels, transport and communication services seem to be slowing down.\nConsumption demand is, however, seen tepid in the current financial year. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) — indicator of consumption demand — is seen growing at 4.4 per cent in 2023-24, the slowest pace in two decades barring the pandemic year of FY21. The previous low for PFCE growth rate was 2.9 per cent in 2002-03. It grew at 7.5 per cent in 2022-23. In contrast, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) is seen sharply up at 4.1 per cent in FY24 as against 0.1 per cent in the previous year.\nInvestments — as reflected in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) — are expected to stay at a high level of 10.3 per cent in FY24 as against 11.4 per cent in 2022-23.\nThe first advance estimates of GDP, obtained by extrapolation of data of the first seven-eight months of the ongoing financial year (FY24), are released early to help officers in the Union Ministry of Finance and other departments in framing the broad contours of Union Budget for the next financial year which is to be presented in Parliament on February 1.\nNominal GDP, which takes into account inflation, is estimated to grow at 8.9 per cent in 2023-24, sharply lower than 16.1 per cent, reflecting the deflation in the wholesale price index (WPI) that is used in calculating the GDP deflator. The annual GDP deflator growth is estimated to be at a 48-year low of 1.4 per cent in 2023-24, as per India Ratings. This is expected to affect the government’s fiscal deficit calculations as the Union Budget for 2023-24 had assumed a nominal GDP growth of 10.5 per cent.\nThe First Revised Estimates of national income for 2022-23 are due for release on February 29 which may also lead to revision in growth rate of first advance estimate for FY24, NSO said.\nBoth the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government had earlier projected a growth rate of 6.5 per cent for FY24, but in its December policy, the RBI revised up the real GDP growth forecast to 7 per cent for FY24.\n“Despite global headwinds, the growth momentum witnessed in FY24 is indicative of the Indian economy’s resilience. However, the road ahead is not going to be easy so long as PFCE does not recover fully and become broad based. Here the key would be to watch the wage growth especially of the households belonging to the lower income bracket because that is what is critical for broad basing the consumption demand. The data shows that the real wage growth of households belonging to the lower income bracket was marginally negative in 2QFY24. Ind-Ra’s calculation shows that a 1% increase in real wages could lead to a 1.12% increase in the real PFCE and the multiplier effect of this could result in a 64 bp increase in the GDP growth,” India Ratings’ Sunil Kumar Sinha and Paras Jasrai said in a note.\nThe per capita real GDP is expected to increase by 6.4 per cent in FY24, while per capita net national income is seen growing 6.3 per cent to Rs 1.05 lakh as against Rs 98,374 last year. “…during the pre pandemic years, the real per capita GDP growth was averaging 5.3%. Additionally, per capita PFCE in real terms will expand by 3.5% in FY24. The post pandemic average of per capita PFCE however is at 6.7%, against 5.5% in pre pandemic era,” State Bank of India’s Group Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in a note.\nSectorally, manufacturing is seen growing at 6.5 per cent in FY24 as against 1.3 per cent growth in the previous year, while mining and quarrying is expected to grow at 8.1 per cent from 4.6 per cent. Construction is expected to post double-digit growth of 10.7 per cent. Agricultural output is, however, seen slowing down with 1.8 per cent growth in 2023-24 as against 4 per cent in the previous year.\nServices sector growth is also projected to moderate to 7.7 per cent in FY24 from 9.5 per cent growth in the previous year. While financial, real estate and professional services are seen growing at 8.9 per cent, higher from 7.1 per cent a year ago, trade, hotels, transport and communication services are seen growing at a slower rate of 6.3 per cent in FY24 than 14 per cent in the previous year.\nThis comes after the Indian economy had posted a higher-than-expected growth of 7.6 per cent in July-September as against 7.8 per cent in April-June. However, economists and the RBI have estimated a slowdown in the remaining two quarters of the financial year, which is expected to continue in FY25.\nWith the first advance estimates of GDP at 7.3 per cent for FY24, back of the envelope calculations show that the Indian economy is estimated to grow 7 per cent in October-March, slower than 7.7 per cent growth in April-September. Economists said GDP projections for the second half may be too optimistic.\nExplained\nResilience in slowing world INDIA continues to post the fastest growth rate amidst a slowing global economy, clearly indicating a resilience despite worries in many parts of the world. A pick up in private consumption can broadbase economic growth.\n“In our view, the growth assumed for H2 FY2024 is quite high, given the tepid outlook for agriculture amidst the weak kharif output and ongoing lag in rabi sowing, as well as the feared temporary slowdown in capex ahead of the General Elections,” Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head – Research and Outreach, ICRA said.\nFor the second half in FY24, the GDP projection of 7.3 per cent factors in a slowdown in PFCE at 4.4 per cent as against 4.5 per cent growth in the first half. “The concerning aspect in the GDP data is the weak consumption growth at 4.4% (for FY24). This would be the slowest consumption growth in the past two decades barring the pandemic year of FY21. Investment has grown by a strong 10.3% led by strong capex by Centre and the state governments. However, for the investment growth to be sustained it is very important for the consumption growth to be bolstered,” Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge Ratings said.\nGovernment final consumption expenditure (GFCE) is also seen slowing down in the second half to 3.1 per cent from 5.1 per cent growth in the first half. Investments through GFCF are expected to sharply pick up with 11 per cent estimated growth in the second half as against 9.5 per cent in April-September\nGross Value Added or GVA — which is GDP minus net product taxes and reflects national income from the output side — is expected to grow at sub-7 per cent with estimated 6.9 per cent in FY24 as against 7.0 per cent last fiscal. Discrepancies, which is the difference in national income when calculated through the income and expenditure approach, accounted for Rs 2.6 lakh crore in overall GDP.\nFor the latest news from across India, Political updates, Explainers, Sports News, Opinion, Entertainment Updates and more Top News, visit Indian Express.

    "text": "Overwatch 2 is in a unique spot right now, with Marvel Rivals gaining traction as an alternative to the hero shooter formula and many players struggling to find a reason to log in. However, Blizzard isn’t slowing down, as the devs continue working hard to bring fresh content to keep things exciting. That said, a recent oversight in their attempt to add a new skin has sparked backlash, with fans demanding refunds after a paid skin was made free less than a day after its release in the store.\nOverwatch 2 Players Demand Refunds After Paid Lúcio Skin is Made Free Less Than a Day Later\nBlizzard recently introduced a new skin for Overwatch 2’s music-loving support hero, Lúcio, with the Cyber DJ skin arriving in the store for 2,800 Overwatch Coins—a steep price, considering 2,000 OW Coins already costs $20. However, backlash erupted when Blizzard announced that the skin would be available for free as part of the OW2 Spotlight event on February 12, where players could earn it simply by watching one hour of a partnered stream.\nEarn Cyber DJ Lucio in\n— Overwatch Cavalry (@OWCavalry)[#Overwatch2]🎛️\nBlizzard is unveiling new heroes, maps, and more at the upcoming Spotlight Event! Plus, watch an invited creator's stream for one hour and score this Legendary Skin.[pic.twitter.com/trw0UTA6i0][January 29, 2025]\nUnsurprisingly, this did not sit well with fans - not because a paid skin was eventually made free (which happens in Overwatch 2 and many other games), but because of how quickly it happened. The skin went from a premium purchase to a free reward in less than a day, leaving early buyers feeling cheated.\nTypically, skins remain exclusive to the store for a while before becoming free, allowing early buyers to enjoy their rarity. This sudden switch, however, has players feeling scammed. Over on X (formerly Twitter), reactions have been just as harsh, with players calling Blizzard’s move \"evil\" and \"scummy,\" and expressing shock that a paid skin became free in under 24 hours.\nMany have demanded refunds, but Blizzard has yet to address the situation. While their actions weren’t illegal, the overwhelmingly negative response suggests that they should consider refunds to regain player trust. If Overwatch 2 wants to keep its fanbase engaged, making amends for this misstep could go a long way.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 09:03:30 The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of turning the Ram Temple dedication ceremony in Ayodhya into a political issue. The party, which has not yet confirmed whether it will participate in the function, has stated that it is standing with the believers in the matter. Speaking after the political affairs committee meeting, PK Kunhalikutty, a prominent leader of IUML, expressed disagreement with the event being turned into a political affair. He emphasized that the party is not against faith or worship, but it is the BJP who is trying to use the inauguration for political gain ahead of the parliamentary elections. Another leader, Sadiqali Thangal, also echoed the sentiment, stating that there was no need to make the issue controversial and that the BJP is using it for political purposes. He further emphasized that the IUML stands with the believers in this matter. Regarding the participation of the Congress in the ceremony, it has been reported that the main leaders who have been invited will not attend. The party’s High Command has instructed not to make a public statement on the matter, indicating that a final decision on the participation is yet to be reached. The IUML’s stance on the Ram Temple dedication ceremony reflects the growing concerns over the politicization of religious events by political parties in the country. With the BJP being accused of using the event for political gain and other parties debating their participation, the issue appears to have become a matter of contention in the run-up to the upcoming elections. #BJP #Ram #temple #dedication #political #issue #League #wont #Congress #participate #function #Ram #Temple",

    "text": "[Tal como se había pronosticado](https://www.losandes.com.ar/sociedad/zonda-hoy-en-mendoza-cuando-podria-bajar-al-llano/), el [viento Zonda bajó al llano](https://www.losandes.com.ar/sociedad/fuertes-rafagas-de-viento-zonda-se-registraron-esta-madrugada-en-el-gran-mendoza/) con mucha fuerza y tierra durante la madrugada del viernes, lo que despertó temprano a muchos mendocinos. Para el mediodía se espera el ingreso de un frente frío. Tras su paso por el sur provincial el día jueves, el reporte de Defensa Civil había anticipado que el Zonda iba a llegar durante la madrugada del viernes a los departamentos del Gran Mendoza. Y así fue, con ráfagas que generaron mucha preocupación: tierra por doquier, árboles y ramas caídas, cortes de luz y nula visibilidad. Las autoridades pidieron circular con precaución. En tanto, la Dirección General de Escuelas (DGE) anunció la suspensión de clases presenciales en el Gran Mendoza y otros sectores (ver detalles abajo). En el aeropuerto, el arribo y la partida de los vuelos se demoraron (Consultar en cada compañía y/o en [la web de Aeropuertos Argentina 2000).](https://www.aeropuertosargentina.com/) Por el efecto del viento seco y cálido, la máxima se registró pasadas las 6 de la mañana: 23°C. ¿Hasta cuándo se estima que durará el Zonda? Según aclaró Defensa Civil, el viento se extendería hasta el mediodía en el Gran Mendoza, momento en el que se producirá el cambio por el ingreso de un frente frío. “El viento Zonda permanecerá durante horas de la mañana con diferentes intensidades para la zona norte, centro y sur. Se espera el ingreso de un frente frío que va a hacer rotar el viento (moderado), al sur y va a poner fin al viento Zonda (cerca del mediodía)”, confirmaron las autoridades. Alrededor de las 13 ya se sentiría el frío, mientras que a las 15 podrían darse las ráfagas más intensas con velocidades de 40 km/h, en zona este. El viento sur se mantendría hasta cerca de la medianoche. El pronóstico de la Dirección de Agricultura y Contingencias Climáticas señala para hoy: “Parcialmente nublado con ascenso de la temperatura. Zonda hasta el mediodía. Precipitaciones aisladas hacia la noche. Nevadas intensas en cordillera”. Los pasos que unen con Chile, el Cristo Redentor y el Pehuenche, siguen cerrados. Se estima que las nevadas se extiendan hasta el martes en la cordillera. Para mañana, sábado 3 de agosto, se espera en Mendoza “poca nubosidad con descenso de la temperatura, vientos leves del noreste. Nevadas en cordillera”. La mínima será de 3°C, mientras que la máxima rondará los 18°C. Sin clases en el turno mañana Por las fuertes ráfagas de viento Zonda, la Dirección General de Escuelas (DGE) suspendió las clases presenciales este viernes en todos los departamentos del Gran Mendoza, Lavalle y Malargüe; así como también localidades como Cordón del Plata, Gualtallary, Santa Clara, El Zampalito, La Carrera (Tupungato), El Sosneado y La Junta (San Rafael). La actividad escolar deberá desarrollarse de manera virtual a través de la plataforma educativa Escuela Digital Mendoza. En el resto de la provincia, el servicio educativo se brinda con total normalidad. Universidades se plegaron a la medida. Recomendaciones frente al viento Zonda - Hidratarse permanentemente, sobre todo niños y adultos mayores. - Tener a mano la medicación en caso de sufrir asma o cualquier otra enfermedad bronquial o pulmonar. - Cerrar la casa lo más herméticamente posible para evitar la entrada del aire seco y caliente del exterior. Tapar con trapos húmedos todas las pequeñas aberturas, como marcos de puertas y ventanas. - En casos extremos, aumentar artificialmente la humedad del interior de la casa a través de un humificador o cacerola con agua en una hornalla con fuego corona. - Tratar de reducir al mínimo la permanencia en el exterior, evitando exponerse a la radiación solar por mucho tiempo. - Evitar la inhalación del polvo suspendido en el aire que arrastra el viento y protegerse los ojos. No tocar objetos metálicos, ya que se pueden producir descargas eléctricas. - Ser precavido en lugares descubiertos. Por momentos, las fuertes ráfagas del viento Zonda pueden arrancar chapas, tejas u otros objetos de los techos y ser arrojados con fuerza a grandes distancias. - Mantenerse alejado de los árboles grandes y frondosos de madera frágil. La fuerza del viento puede quebrar ramas y arrojarlas sobre las personas. - No estacionar el automóvil bajo árboles. - Al conducir extremar la precaución. - Evitar el manejo de materiales inflamables y elementos que pueden provocar chispas o fuego, ya que la sequedad del ambiente durante el Zonda eleva la posibilidad de incendios. Asegurarse de apagar completamente la colilla del cigarrillo antes de arrojarla.",

    "text": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces\nJewish charities called the findings ‘shocking’, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was ‘deeply worrying’.\nThe number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "title": "The great escape: 12 places to find short-haul sunshine if you can’t wait till summer",
    "text": "It wouldn’t be an overstatement to say that the travel industry has a habit of inventing buzzwords: staycation, babymoon, glamping, bleisure, ­jetiquette – the list goes on. But what of this weekend’s “Sunshine Saturday”?\nActually, we will allow that one, because it does carry a certain weight. It is, you see, that very thing – the crucial first Saturday of the year, when we look up from the crumbs of the final mince pie, and remember that the next few weeks are going to be grim. Christmas is over, and December has packed away its festive sparkle, leaving in its place the cold drudgery of January and February, a March that is barely better, and an April that can’t come soon enough. No wonder the first day of the first full weekend of the year is the moment we collectively say “enough of this, I need a break.”\nThat’s the thinking, anyway. “Sunshine Saturday” is supposedly the holiday industry’s busiest day of the calendar; a frantic 24 hours when more than a million Britons either go online or visit a high-street travel agent to book their next getaway. And not a weekend in the Cotswolds or a round-the-world cruise either, although these can be excellent ideas – but the traditional seven-night dash to the sun. Anything but face another morning of swirling rain without a few days of hot-weather respite scrawled somewhere in the diary.\n“Sunshine Saturday” is supposedly the holiday industry’s busiest day of the calendar Credit : Reinhard Schmid So where to go? It’s a good question, particularly if you would rather throw a few things into a bag and run to the airport before winter is out – rather than wait for high summer.\nHere we present a trio of options for each of the next four months, bracketed into three simple categories: Warm (15-18 Celsius); Warmer (19-22C); Warmest (23C+). The only other factor is that these are all short-haul trips, keeping to Europe or the fringes of Africa and Asia.\nYou can, of course, go further; Dubai and the Caribbean rarely seem more enticing than when the new-year wind is howling outside. But if you fancy a dose of vitamin D without having to cross an ocean, your answer may be below...\nJanuary Ah, January, the least-loved of all months. The weather is foul, the sun sets almost as soon as it rises, and your friends are insisting on four weeks of sobriety. If ever there were a time for an impulsive holiday, it’s now…\nWarm: Tenerife (18C) Proper warmth can be hard to find in Europe in the first weeks of the year. Even the parts of the continent that are politically European – but geographically African – struggle to muster anything that might be considered a heatwave amid the January gloom.\nThis includes the largest Canary Island, whose image as a haven of guaranteed winter sun can be a little over-egged. That said, Tenerife is far hotter than the UK in these early pages of the diary, and while there are many reasons to visit Spain’s greatest outpost – cool capital Santa Cruz, the epic slopes of Mount Teide – its resort hotels are certainly reason enough.\nDo it: The south-westerly Costa Adeje is home to the island’s best resorts, including the five-star Bahia del Duque, with its Michelin-starred dining, offered by Destinology (01204 208 443; destinology.co.uk ).\nTenerife's resort hotels are reason enough to visit Credit : Getty Images Warmer: Agadir (20C) The advantage of having a vast continental landmass and the dunes of the Sahara behind it gives Morocco’s southernmost holiday hotspot a small temperature edge over its Canarian near-neighbour.\nOnly 425 miles and a smidgeon of latitude separate Tenerife and Agadir – and while the chief Canary has a broader selection of hotels and a wider range of flight connections, its North African cousin is becoming an increasingly popular choice for Europeans fleeing the winter.\nThe quality of its beaches helps. Both Plage d’Agadir (in the city) and Plage Aourir (a little to the north) offer splendid curves of sand.\nDo it: A seven-night all-inclusive stay at the Iberostar Founty Beach Hotel (a comfy four-star property on the city’s main beach), flying out of Gatwick on January 20, costs from £459 per person – through Love Holidays (01234 230 440; loveholidays.com ).\nTenerife's North African cousin is becoming an increasingly popular choice for Europeans fleeing the winter Credit : Shutterstock Warmest: Senegal (26C) If you want upper-Twenties heat in January without crossing an ocean, Africa is the nearest realistic option. But you don’t have to go all the way to Cape Town to see the sun on its best behaviour. Since November 2022, Tui has offered direct flights from Gatwick to Dakar, putting Senegal on the menu for mainstream package holidays.\nAdmittedly, the distance and time involved (2,700 miles; six hours) pushes the idea of “short-haul” to its limit – but the welcome feel of 26C on your skin should make the journey worthwhile.\nDo it: Tui is not the only major travel company to dip a toe into Senegal. The Spanish hotel giant Riu is another recent arrival in the West African country, operating the five-star Riu Baobab, with its four pools and four restaurants. A seven-night all-inclusive stay, flying on January 22, starts at £988 a head (020 3451 2688; tui.co.uk ).",

Les deux accusés ont été condamnés à 18 de réclusion criminelle, assorties d’une peine de sûreté des deux tiers\nDans le cadre du procès de l’attentat de Nice , la cour d’assises spéciale de Paris a prononcé jeudi des peines de 18 ans de réclusion criminelle, assorties d’une peine de sûreté des deux tiers, à l’encontre des deux accusés jugés en appel. La cour a confirmé le jugement de première instance et n’a pas suivi les réquisitions de l’avocate générale, qui avait demandé 20 ans d’emprisonnement. Les avocats des deux accusés avaient plaidé mardi et mercredi leur acquittement.\nMohamed Ghraieb, réceptionniste d’hôtel franco-tunisien de 48 ans, et Chokri Chafroud, 44 ans, un migrant tunisien sans-papiers, étaient poursuivis pour association de malfaiteurs terroriste. Ils étaient accusés d’avoir apporté « un soutien logistique et idéologique » à Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, le Tunisien de 31 ans auteur de l’attentat au camion-bélier sur la promenade des Anglais le soir de la fête nationale, qui a fait 86 morts le 14 juillet 2016.
