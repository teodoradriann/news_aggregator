    "text": "EXETER, N.H. (Gray News) – Police in a New Hampshire town were surprised to find the Grinch behind the wheel of a crashed car on Christmas Day.\nAccording to the Exeter Police Department , the “unusual” crash involved a driver dressed as the Grinch who veered off the roadway and struck a sign and a mailbox.\nPolice responded to the call just before 6 p.m. on Dec. 25. When officers arrived, they found the driver wearing a full Grinch costume.\nThe 31-year-old driver was uninjured. His vehicle had significant front-end damage along with a smashed windshield and a broken window, police said.\n“This was certainly a unique situation,” Exeter Police Chief Stephan Poulin said. “Officers never expected to arrive at the scene to find that an operator was wearing a Grinch suit behind the wheel, but it was Christmas night so not entirely outside the realm of possibility.”\nCopyright 2023 Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "¡Espectáculo celestial en Baja California! Cómo y dónde ver las Auroras Boreales esta madrugada\nPara obtener la mejor experiencia visual, es importante alejarse de las áreas urbanas y la contaminación lumínica.\nMexicali, B.C.- Hoy, 11 de octubre de 2024, las auroras boreales serán visibles en Baja California debido a una tormenta solar severa que está afectando el campo magnético de la Tierra.\nEste fenómeno es bastante inusual para latitudes tan al sur. Desde la madrugada, se han reportado avistamientos en varias zonas de Baja California, con cielos iluminados en colores vibrantes.\nPara obtener una mejor visualización, lo ideal es alejarse de las luces de la ciudad y buscar cielos despejados en áreas más rurales.\nAunque es probable que el fenómeno sea visible a simple vista, se recomienda utilizar cámaras para capturar los colores con mayor claridad, ya que los sensores de los dispositivos modernos pueden resaltar mejor los matices que el ojo humano.\nEste evento también ha sido presenciado en otros estados del norte de México como Sonora y Chihuahua.\nPara apreciar mejor las auroras boreales en Baja California, lo ideal es buscar lugares alejados de la contaminación lumínica y con cielos despejados. Aquí algunas sugerencias:\n- Valle de Guadalupe: Conocido por sus viñedos, este valle ofrece cielos despejados y es una excelente opción para observar las auroras en un ambiente tranquilo y rural.\n- Sierra de San Pedro Mártir: Esta zona montañosa es una de las mejores opciones debido a su altitud y la baja interferencia de luces artificiales. Además, al ser un área protegida, el ambiente es ideal para la observación astronómica.\n- Laguna Hanson: Ubicada en el Parque Nacional Constitución de 1857, este lugar es perfecto por su aislamiento y cielos oscuros, lo que permite una buena visibilidad de las auroras.\n- Playas alejadas de Ensenada o Rosarito: Las playas más apartadas, lejos de las zonas turísticas, también pueden ofrecer una buena vista del fenómeno si los cielos están despejados.\n- Desierto de Cataviña: Con poca contaminación lumínica, esta área desértica al sur de Baja California también puede ser un buen punto de observación.\nLas auroras boreales en Baja California se podrán observar mejor durante las horas de la madrugada del 11 de octubre de 2024, aproximadamente entre la 1:00 a.m. y las 4:00 a.m. Este es el momento en que los cielos suelen estar más oscuros, y la actividad geomagnética estará en su punto máximo. Además, se espera que la tormenta solar continúe por varias horas, lo que permitirá un período prolongado de visibilidad del fenómeno.\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.

    "text": "Cher is taking legal steps to help her son, Elijah Blue Allman, who allegedly struggles with substance abuse: She's filed for a conservatorship of him.\nIn legal documents obtained by ABC News, Cher states that she wants to be the sole conservator of Elijah's estate because she claims he is \\\"substantially unable to manage his financial resources.\\\"\nAccording to the documents, Elijah, 47, Cher's son with her late ex-husband, Gregg Allman, is due to receive money from a trust before the end of 2023. However, she claims that because he's currently suffering from \\\"severe mental health and substance abuse issues,\\\" according to the filing, Cher believes that \\\"any money [he] receives will be \\\"immediately spent on drugs ... putting [his] life at risk.\\\"\nThe documents also claim that Cher believes that Elijah's wife, Marieangela King, from whom he filed for divorce in 2021, shouldn't be the conservator because she allegedly is \\\"not supportive of Elijah's recovery\\\" and \\\"actively works to keep Elijah from getting clean and sober or receiving mental health treatment that he desperately needs.\\\"\nFurthermore, the documents state that Cher has \\\"worked tirelessly\\\" to get Elijah \\\"the help he needs,\\\" and that two of his siblings have nominated her to act as conservator.\nIt's not clear to which siblings Cher is referring, but the filing lists three of Gregg Allman's five children – including Devon Allman, lead singer of The Allman Betts Band – and Cher's son, Chaz Bono, from her marriage to the late Sonny Bono.\nA hearing for a temporary order of conservatorship is set for January 5. A hearing that will decide whether to make the order permanent is set for March 6.\nIn December 2022, King alleged in court documents, requesting that a hearing pertaining to their divorce be rescheduled, that four people who were allegedly \\\"hired\\\" by Cher came to her and Allman's New York City hotel room and \\\"removed\\\" Allman from the room. King said that the incident happened the night of Nov. 30, while she and Allman were \\\"working on our marriage.\\\"\nAt the time, King said she was told that she wasn't \\\"allowed to see or speak to [Allman] who is currently in lockdown at a treatment facility that is undisclosed to me.\\\"\nCher responded to the allegations in an October 2023 interview with People , declaring \\\"that rumor is not true.\\\"\n\\\"Good Morning America\\\" has reached out to King's lawyer for comment.",
