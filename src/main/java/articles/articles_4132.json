Mirandinha apareceu entre os zagueiros para emendar de bicicleta e fazer um lindo gol no Raulino de Oliveira.\n— Foi tudo muito rápido. Quando o Bruno deu a bike eu não pensei duas vezes. Foi a reação que veio na hora. Graças a Deus, fui feliz de fazer o gol . Esse gol traz uma confiança a mais. Espero que seja o primeiro de muitos — disse .\nCom os três pontos, o Volta Redonda sobe para a 6ª colocação no Campeonato Carioca.

    "text": "A “localised tornado” tore roofs off houses and destroyed walls as Storm Gerrit caused devastation.\nThe Met Office said a supercell thunderstorm crossed Greater Manchester on Wednesday night and that it had a “strong rotating updraft”, which suggests “a tornado at the surface was likely”.\nAround 100 properties were damaged in Stalybridge, Tameside, and residents in the badly hit village of Carrbrook told of the states of “absolute disaster” houses were in.\nStalybridge resident Kerry Hogan told the BBC it was “bedlam” with trees toppling “like dominoes” while another woman said a tree fell into her bathroom.Ms Hogan told BBC Radio 5 Live the tornado “lasted a minute, 90 seconds, literally a whirlwind of madness” and it “sounded horrendous”.\n“We couldn’t open the front door as the wind was that bad,” she added.\n“Lamp-posts were swaying, we watched trees topple like dominoes.\n“All the neighbours were out, it was bedlam.\n“People have had cars crushed.\n“It was horrific and how nobody has been hurt is unbelievable.”\nEvacuated Carrbrook resident Hayley McCaffer said she was “luckily” at the pub when the tornado struck on Wednesday just before midnight.\n“Some of the neighbours’ houses are an absolute disaster – the roof missing, gable ends gone, cars squished with all the stone that’s come off the houses,” she said.\n“Luckily for us, very luckily, we were in the pub last night when it happened.\n“We weren’t here, but also we had parked our car there and looking at the state of our driveway – one of the walls has come down – we were very lucky that it wasn’t parked there because it would have not been in a good state today.”\nAround 2,900 homes in Scotland remained without electricity on Thursday evening, with around 1,500 expected to be without electricity until Friday, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said.\nSome ScotRail services were still being cancelled, delayed or revised on Thursday as flooding and road closures caused further travel chaos. Avanti West Coast services departing from London Euston had extended journey times as they are diverted via the Midlands.\nAll Great Western Railway and Elizabeth line services between London Paddington and Reading were blocked after a person was struck by a train. All services were also suspended for a time to and from London Euston due to another person hit by a train.\nFerry services between the Port of Dover and France were operating with delays due to strong winds in the Channel. Passengers were advised to “check-in as normal” and will be transferred “onto the first available sailing on arrival”.\nDamage pictured on the roofs of a row of terraced houses in Stalybridge (REUTERS)\nThe Met Office said the storm had now passed but further unsettled weather was likely later in the week, with strong winds, rain and some upland snow.\nIn Yorkshire three men died after a 4×4 went into a river in an area affected by flooding from the storm.\nNorth Yorkshire Police said they were called to the vehicle in the River Esk near Glaisdale in the North York Moors at 11.48am on Thursday.\nThe vehicle was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm.\nA police spokesperson advised people to travel with care after the “tragic incident”.Police warned that roads around the River Esk are “particularly badly affected”.\nCars became stuck in flood water in two other incidents, in nearby Houlsyke and Hambleton, police said. The occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\nTameside Council said around 100 properties were evacuated when the “mini tornado” hit areas of Carrbrook and Millbrook.\nA spokesperson said: “It is believed everyone affected made arrangements to stay with family and friends overnight.\n“Our officers have been out all night and continue to be out today clearing debris, fallen trees and making roads, footpaths and other areas safe.”\nGreater Manchester Police said officers were called to “numerous reports of significant damage” to homes in Stalybridge, Tameside, at around 11.45pm.\nPhotos and videos posted to social media show several roofs of homes blown off and windows smashed. No injuries were reported but many residents were forced to leave their homes.\nChief Superintendent Mark Dexter from GMP said: “This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night.\n“Our highest priority is keeping people safe which is why we are advising those who have been displaced not to return or enter their properties which have significant damage until they have been assessed by structural engineers.\n“I would also like to urge members of the public to avoid the area where possible and take extra care when travelling in vehicles on the roads in Stalybridge and the surrounding areas, due to debris in the road.”\nParts of Scotland experienced significant heavy snow with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) saying workers had been dealing with wind speeds of 80mph in some coastal areas as they worked to reconnect customers.\nHigh winds and heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks across Scotland as fallen trees, branches and other debris brought down power lines.\nScottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution said that as of 11am on Thursday supplies had been restored to some 34,000 customers, with around 7,700 left without power.\nAndy Smith, SSEN distribution operations director, said: “Our teams continue to make really good progress in restoring power following the significant impact of Storm Gerrit.\n“Adverse conditions on the roads hampered our efforts last night, but thankfully conditions have improved this morning and we’re making progress with the work that needs to be done.\n“But it will take time to complete all repairs. Some customers in rural areas where there are multiple points of damage, will be without power until Friday.”\nHe said welfare vans providing hot food and drink have been sent to some areas affected, including Grantown, Fort Augustus, Fraserburgh and Banchory.\nScotland Police confirmed the A9 has fully reopened in both directions and is “passable with care” after snow blocked the road between Drumochter and Dalwhinnie.\nCars stuck in flood water in Old Kilpatrick, Scotland (Getty Images)\nInspector Michelle Burns, from Police Scotland’s Road Policing Unit, said: “Conditions for travel in the affected areas may be hazardous and extra caution should be exercised by all road users.\nThe A90 northbound has also reopened after earlier closures, but southbound lanes at Lochlands, Forfar remained off-limits with local diversions in place.\nScotland’s rail network experienced widespread cancellations and delays with a train driver’s cabin hit by a falling tree.\nAslef Scotland confirmed the driver was uninjured and Labour MSP Paul Sweeney said passengers were also unharmed.\nHigh tide in Brighton (Getty Images)\nScotRail suspended multiple train services until further notice, impacting trains travelling while other lines saw their timetables shelved until “a full inspection can be carried out” on the railway network.\nTrain operator LNER, which runs services between London and Scotland on the East Coast Main Line, also advised customers not to travel due to the weather.\nCustomers stranded by the disruption were told to book hotels which they can claim back.\nAvanti West Coast, which operates services on the West Coast Main Line, said its route to Scotland is impassable with all services to and from London terminating at Preston.\nThose with pre-booked tickets for travel between Preston and either Edinburgh or Glasgow can board trains on Thursday or Friday, the operator said.\nMillennium Bridge in London (PA)\nHeathrow Airport cancelled 18 flights on Wednesday due to air traffic control restrictions including routes from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey and Manchester as well as to Barcelona, Berlin, Madrid and Paris.\nA video posted to social media showed a bumpy landing for one American Airlines flight on Wednesday.\nStorm Gerrit also brought plenty of rain gauge at the Great Langdale Valley in the Lake District recording 80mm – nearly half the usual 178mm monthly rainfall for December, the Met Office said.\nThe fastest recorded wind gusts so far are 86mph at Inverbervie on the north-east coast of Scotland, 84mph at Fair Isle and 83mph at Capel Curig, north Wales, the forecaster said.\nRegister now for one of the Evening Standard’s newsletters.
