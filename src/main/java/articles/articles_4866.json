    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "The Wonders of Self-Healing Concrete In the world of construction, innovation is constantly pushing boundaries, and one of the most exciting advancements in recent years is self-healing concrete. This remarkable material has the ability to repair itself after damage, offering a revolutionary solution to a common problem in the industry. What is Self-Healing Concrete? Self-healing concrete is a type of concrete that incorporates various mechanisms to repair cracks and other damage that may occur over time. These mechanisms typically involve the use of: - Microcapsules: These capsules contain healing agents that are released when a crack forms, allowing the concrete to seal itself. - Bacteria: Certain types of bacteria can produce calcium carbonate, which acts as a cementing agent to fill cracks. - Self-healing fibers: These fibers can expand and fill cracks, preventing further damage. How Does Self-Healing Concrete Work? The exact mechanism of self-healing depends on the specific technology used. However, the general principle involves the following steps: - Crack Formation: When a crack forms, it exposes the healing agents or bacteria to the environment. - Activation: The healing agents are activated by water or other environmental factors, causing them to react and begin the repair process. - Repair: The healing agents fill the crack, creating a stronger bond and restoring the structural integrity of the concrete. Benefits of Self-Healing Concrete Self-healing concrete offers numerous advantages over traditional concrete, including: - Increased Durability: The ability to repair itself extends the lifespan of concrete structures, reducing the need for costly repairs. - Enhanced Safety: Cracks in concrete can weaken structures and pose safety risks. Self-healing concrete mitigates these risks by preventing further damage. - Reduced Maintenance Costs: The self-repairing properties of the material reduce the need for frequent maintenance and inspections. - Sustainability: Self-healing concrete reduces the need for concrete replacement, contributing to a more sustainable construction industry. Applications of Self-Healing Concrete Self-healing concrete has the potential to revolutionize the construction industry, with applications ranging from: - Buildings and Bridges: Enhancing the durability and safety of these structures. - Roads and Highways: Reducing the need for repairs and maintenance, leading to smoother and safer roads. - Infrastructure: Extending the lifespan of vital infrastructure, such as dams and tunnels. The Future of Self-Healing Concrete Self-healing concrete is still a relatively new technology, but it holds immense promise for the future of construction. Ongoing research and development are leading to improvements in its effectiveness and efficiency. As the technology matures, we can expect to see wider adoption and more innovative applications of self-healing concrete. Conclusion Self-healing concrete is a game-changer in the construction industry, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution to a long-standing challenge. Its ability to repair itself after damage makes it a highly desirable material for a wide range of applications. As research and development continue, we can expect to see even more groundbreaking advancements in this revolutionary technology.",

    "text": "[](/bd/corporate/companies/ten-entrepreneurs-picked-for-inaugural-startup-scale-up-program--4541150) Ten entrepreneurs picked for inaugural startup scale up program [Arts](/bd/lifestyle/art) Heartbreak: Sitawa Namwalie’s stories filled with wit, music, insightFriday March 01 2024 Sitawa Namwalie may be best known for being a poet and performing artist. But there are many more theatrical facets of this dynamic actor, playwright, director and storyteller who can use multiple media to make her stories palatable and entertaining as well as enlightening and inspiring. Sitawa is currently working on her first musical production. Fortunately, she found time to return to her strong hand, that of poetry and performance, blended with music by solo musician, and singer-guitarist Otivo Stingotho. Stories from the Capital of Broken Hearts was staged last weekend at Braeburn School Gitanga in Nairobi where Sitawa’s cast served up as an “intergenerational conversation between the young and the old”. This she told BDLife and other audience members before the show began last Sunday afternoon. Produced and directed by Sitawa herself. She also assembled the quartet of actor-storytellers, including Mufasa ‘the poet’ Kibet, Wanjiku Gicheru, Mudamba Mudamba, and Sitawa who included guitarist-singer Otivo Stingotho to make cool music during interludes between the 12 poetic story-conversations. Sitawa’s ‘conversations’ were filled with a wide range of emotions, from humour and irony, passion and pride to resentment and jealousy, sorrow and remorse. Memory also played an important role as the actors interrogated a diverse set of broken hearts and wondered what could have caused all this grief. It was then we discovered how deep one had to delve to find out the actual cause (multiple causes) that led to hearts being broken. The quartet arrived on stage walking as if they could be one of the broken-hearted or one of the heart-breakers or both. Ultimately, we would see that almost everyone had experienced a bruised or broken heart and that no one cause could be seen as the sole source that caused the breakage. But first, there was a wonderful delivery of Sitawa’s 12 inspired poems by an inspired cast. Set on a bare stage with actors mostly standing, or occasionally sitting on stools, the costuming was casual apart from Wanjiku Gicheru’s elegant red evening dress and the two thick black wigs worn by Mudamba and Sitawa, while Mufasa donned his classic black Beret. Then began the conversations, with the first two, an amusing interchange between the older woman (Sitawa) asking ‘Was I ever’ as beautiful and desirable as this young woman here, referring to Wanjiku who enjoyed being admired like the young slay queen she probably was. Then came the slay queen herself, asking, ‘Will I Ever’ be as dilapidated as that old woman over there? She’s a nasty, insulting child who got a solid verbal slap from the mama for her abuse. Sitawa even warned the slay queen she wouldn’t be beautiful forever, that age would also catch up with her, so wise up or else she’d be caught off guard. From then on, we heard about a whole range of heart-breaking experiences. For instance, Mufasa delivered a tragic monologue about ‘When My Father Got Sick’ which broke the son’s heart. But what caused the heartbreak wasn’t a single event. It was evolutionary, starting with his mother leaving his dad which broke his father’s heart. After that, his dad lost his job and took to drinking, which the son found most disheartening. Then the dad got sick, and we never heard the end of the story. But it was clear the son’s heart was also broken by the family rupture, the tragic loss of both his parents, all three of whom had been damaged in their way. We also heard from Mudamba who lightened up the scene as he mused on the power of memory and ‘The First Hello’ that he struggled, as a youth to get from an early version of Sitawa. This conversation laid the groundwork for a cat-and-mouse game between the soon-to-be lovers, Mudamba and Sitawa. But their mutual ‘First Love’ status was badly shaken by the time they gave their final monologue cum conversation. Before that, we heard Mufasa mocking the whole concept of first love, given he was a specialist in breaking young women’s hearts (including Wanjiku’s) and allowing them to ignorantly believe that he was the faithful type, meanwhile enjoying his status as Casanova (the male equivalent of slay queen). In the end, the middle-aged male accused his wife of letting him down by having only four children. He broke her heart with his vanity and selfish pride. But finally, it would seem that everyone was guilty of breaking somebody’s heart somehow somewhere. Forgiveness and love looked like the only means of emerging from the breakage and liberating hearts.
