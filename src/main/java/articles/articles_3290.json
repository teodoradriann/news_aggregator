    "title": "Bird flu raising concerns amid otherwise calm respiratory virus season ahead of holidays - The Globe and Mail",
    "text": "It’s relatively calm on Canada’s respiratory virus front heading into the holiday season, but doctors are concerned about additional cases of bird flu being identified in North America and possible viral mutations. Influenza cases are rising nationally but remain at seasonal levels, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada’s latest FluWatch report, which details influenza trends across the country. Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is also gaining ground while COVID levels are decreasing. Waste-water testing, also from PHAC, found viral levels of COVID and flu are moderate, while RSV is high.\nFlu season was irregular after the height of the COVID pandemic – with earlier and more intense presentations of the virus – but is settling back into a more standard pattern, which means there will likely be an uptick of people getting sick into January and February. The current situation this holiday season should come as good news, said Fiona Brinkman, a professor of genomics and bioinformatics at Simon Fraser University, but with a “big asterisk.”\n“The recent evolution of bird flu is a real concern,” said Dr. Brinkman, who tracks the evolution of avian flu viruses. She said the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which severely sickened a patient in Louisiana this week and a British Columbia teenager last month, and the unrelated discovery this year of bird flu in cows in the United States are cause for caution.\nCalifornia declared a state of emergency on Wednesday over the outbreak of avian flu in dairy cows. The H5N1 virus has not yet been detected in Canadian cattle. Both the B.C. and Louisiana cases are believed to be connected to birds.\nThe Louisiana resident, who is over 65, was admitted to hospital in critical condition after suspected contact with an infected backyard flock. An investigation into the B.C. adolescent, whose age and gender are not being released by the province, concluded that their case is likely connected to wild birds, not farmed poultry.\nThe B.C. young person was in critical condition but their current status is unknown. The province declined to give an update on the teenager’s case on Thursday.\nThere is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of avian flu and health officials across Canada have stressed that the risk to the general public remains low despite widespread infections detected in domestic and wild birds.\n“But this is the first winter where we’re going to have seasonal flu mixing with that flu and we’re just not sure what’s going to happen,” said Dr. Brinkman. She said there is potential for a reassortment virus, which is created when two or more viruses mix with one another and create a new infective agent.\nAllison McGeer, an infectious-disease physician at Sinai Health System in Toronto, said one of the problems in Canada is that most data on the respiratory viruses capture a moment in time rather than the current situation.\n“When the season is starting, that’s a big gap,” Dr. McGeer said. She said it is still too early this season to determine the predominant influenza A strain, though H1N1 is currently the ruling subtype over H3N2.\nThe difference, she explained, is that people can accumulate protection against H1N1 over a lifetime so the virus tends to affect children more than adults, which can result in increased visits to pediatric emergency departments and family physician offices. Whereas H3N2, because it evolves faster and there is not that same protection, leads to more disease in older adults than in children and can be particularly brutal for places such as nursing homes.\nEither scenario doesn’t play well in places such as Manitoba and Ontario where emergency-department closings are expected to take place over the holidays.\nJoss Reimer, president of the Canadian Medical Association and a hospitalist in Winnipeg, said a staffing crisis in Manitoba is affecting the health care system overall but it is most obvious in emergency departments.\n“Cardiologists have this expression that time is muscle when it comes to heart attacks. And that means, that if we don’t respond quickly, that’s going to cost the heart muscle,” she said. “We don’t want people delaying care because their ER isn’t open until a certain hour, but that might be the reality for some communities.”\nWith a report from Kelly Grant in Toronto",

    "text": "While rice is a staple food in lots of cultures, ingesting it at dinner — specially white rice — won't be the healthiest choice. Skipping rice for your night meal can offer several advantages for digestion, weight management, and universal metabolic fitness.\n1. Slows Down night time-Time Metabolism\nAt night, your frame’s metabolism evidently slows down. Eating rice — that's excessive in easy carbohydrates — can cause extra glucose being stored as fat as opposed to used for electricity.\n2. Might also make a contribution to Weight benefit\nWhite rice has a excessive glycemic index, causing quick spikes in blood sugar. At night, whilst you're much less active, this spike is much more likely to result in fat garage, in particular around the stomach.\n3.Can Disrupt Sleep in some humans\nFor sensitive individuals, a heavy rice-primarily based meal would possibly purpose bloating or indigestion, interfering with restful sleep. Spicy or oily rice preparations could make it worse.\n4. Offers Low Satiety\nRice digests speedy and might go away you feeling hungry again earlier than bedtime, leading to late-night time snacking — every other contributor to weight advantage.\n🌿 healthier Dinner alternatives:\nQuinoa or millets: higher in fiber and protein\nVegetable-rich soups or salads\nGrilled lean protein with sautéed vegetables\nEntire wheat chapatis or dal with vegetables\nEnd:\nSkipping rice at dinner can help better digestion, weight manage, and blood sugar balance. Opt for lighter, high-fiber, and protein-wealthy food inside the evening for a more fit, more restful night time.\nDisclaimer: This content has been sourced and edited from Indiaherald.

Nos llevan a la ruina”, ha afirmado.\nEl dirigente de Vox ha vuelto a acusar al PP y al PSOE de formar una “coalición” en Bruselas votando conjuntamente el 90% de las medidas impulsadas por el Parlamento Europeo, medidas que en su opinión “han hecho a los españoles más pobres porque ceden ante los burócratas del norte de Europa”. “Son políticas que han llevado a la ruina a los españoles y la responsabilidad es suya”, ha insistido Buxadé.\n“Nos llevan a la ruina y abren las puertas de Europa a los productos de Marruecos y a esas fresas regadas con aguas fecales o a esas cebollas de Senegal…” ha proseguido el candidato de Vox, que ha concluido acusando a ambos partidos de “haber destruido ya todo el sector productivo del campo español”.\nCopiar enlace 23:16 h, ayer\nGalán (Sumar) recuerda a Vox que Europa \"ha acogido a siete millones de personas\" por la guerra de Ucrania \"y no ha pasado nada\" La candidata de Sumar a las elecciones europeas, Estrella Galán, ha querido refutar este jueves el discurso antiinmigración de Vox recordando que Europa, en los últimos años, “ha acogido a siete millones de personas”, entre otras, refugiadas de la guerra de Ucrania sin que haya habido un incremento en la delincuencia como sostiene la extrema derecha.\n“Dejen de mentir”, le ha dicho Galán a Jorge Buxadé, el representante de Vox en el debate de RTVE, al que ha recordado que pese a esa llegada de inmigrantes “no ha pasado nada”.

    "title": "Mpox : Pourquoi l’OMS a convoqué « un comité d’urgence » face à la propagation du virus ?",
    "text": "Il veut une réunion « dès que possible » du comité d’urgence pour évaluer s’il faut décréter le plus haut degré d’alerte face à l’épidémie du virus. Mercredi, le directeur général de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus a annoncé des mesures face au risque de propagation du Mpox. « Compte tenu de la propagation du Mpox en dehors de la République démocratique du Congo et de la possibilité d’une nouvelle propagation internationale à l’intérieur et en dehors de l’Afrique, j’ai décidé de convoquer un comité d’urgence […] afin qu’il me conseille sur la question de savoir si l’épidémie constitue une urgence de santé publique de portée internationale », a-t-il déclaré. A la suite de cette annonce, l’agence de santé de l’Union africaine Africa CDC (Centres de contrôle et de prévention des maladies du continent) va « probablement » déclarer la semaine prochaine « une urgence de santé publique » face à cette épidémie de Mpox, en cours dans plusieurs pays africains, a annoncé jeudi son directeur. La décision de l’agence continentale va notamment permettre de débloquer des fonds et d’avoir une réponse continentale. Une première pour l’Africa CDC Cette déclaration « d’urgence de santé publique », qui aura lieu « probablement » la semaine prochaine, est une première pour l’Africa CDC « depuis que ce mandat nous a été confié en 2023 », a déclaré à des journalistes Jean Kaseya, son directeur. « Nous prenons les mesures appropriées, nous décidons quand il y a une urgence, nous prenons les décisions appropriées et parlons d’une seule voix », a déclaré Jean Kaseya. Au moins 16 pays du continent, sur 55, ont déjà enregistré des cas de Mpox, selon l’Africa CDC, avec 887 cas répertoriés la semaine dernière, et cinq décès. Une nouvelle souche de Mpox, détectée en République démocratique du Congo (RDC) en septembre 2023 puis signalée dans plusieurs pays voisins, fait craindre une propagation de ce virus. Epidémie mondiale en 2022 Le Mpox a été découvert pour la première fois chez des humains en 1970 dans l’actuelle RDC (ex-Zaïre), avec la diffusion du sous-type Clade I (dont le nouveau variant est une mutation), principalement limitée depuis à des pays de l’ouest et du centre de l’Afrique, les malades étant généralement contaminés par des animaux infectés. En 2022, une épidémie mondiale, portée par le sous-type clade 2, s’est propagée dans une centaine de pays où la maladie n’était pas endémique, touchant surtout des hommes homosexuels et bisexuels. L’OMS avait alors décrété l’alerte maximale en juillet 2022 face à cette flambée de cas dans le monde, puis l’avait levée moins d’un an après, en mai 2023. L’épidémie avait fait quelque 140 morts sur environ 90.000 cas. La crainte de la propagation du virus Mais la nouvelle souche du Mpox, détectée en RDC en septembre 2023 et baptisée « Clade Ib », puis signalée dans plusieurs pays voisins, fait craindre une propagation de ce virus. Elle est en outre plus mortelle et plus transmissible que les précédentes et se transmet de personne à personne. La « Clade Ib » fait apparaître des éruptions cutanées sur tout le corps, quand les précédentes souches étaient caractérisées par des éruptions et des lésions localisées, sur la bouche, le visage ou les parties génitales. Parmi les pays concernés figurent notamment le Kenya, le Burundi, le Rwanda ou encore la Côte d’Ivoire, mais c’est pour l’heure la RDC le pays le plus touché avec, au 3 août, 14.479 cas confirmés et suspects et 455 morts, soit une létalité d’environ 3 %, selon l’Africa CDC.",
