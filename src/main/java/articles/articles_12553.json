    "text": "Harnessing hemp for sustainable fashion\nIn the quest for sustainable\nfashion, hemp emerges as a revolutionary choice.\nThis article explores how hemp is transforming the industry by offering an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fabrics.\nWith its minimal environmental footprint and versatile applications, hemp stands out not just as a trend but as a sustainable solution for future fashion.\nThe rise of hemp fabric\nHemp, with centuries of use, is now a modern fashion staple, propelled by environmental concerns. This crop distinguishes itself from cotton by needing far less water and zero pesticides for growth, positioning it as a more eco-friendly material. Additionally, hemp's inherent durability enhances the lifespan of clothing items, contributing to waste reduction. These attributes underscore hemp's role in promoting sustainable fashion practices.\nWhy choose hemp?\nChoosing hemp aids our planet significantly. Its growth boosts soil health and requires much less water than crops like cotton. Hemp fabric, being biodegradable, minimizes environmental impact after use. Embracing hemp in fashion supports sustainability and promotes a cleaner industry, aligning with efforts to protect our environment for future generations without sacrificing factual detail or clarity.\nIncorporating hemp into your wardrobe\nBegin your sustainable fashion journey by incorporating hemp-based accessories, such as hats or bags, into your daily outfits. These items are not only stylish but also boast durability and eco-friendliness. Opting for hemp accessories is a simple yet effective way to make more sustainable fashion choices. This approach allows you to maintain both quality and aesthetics in your wardrobe without compromise.\nCaring for hemp clothing\nCaring for hemp clothing is straightforward: Wash in cold water and air dry to maintain quality and minimize energy consumption. Avoiding harsh chemicals preserves the fabric's natural qualities, ensuring garments stay in good condition longer. This care routine reduces the need for frequent replacements, supporting sustainable fashion practices that benefit our planet and future generations through eco-friendly wardrobe choices.",

    "text": "Taylor & Francis Group A new analysis of U.S. mortality data reveals the disproportionate impact of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) on older adults, males and certain racial and ethnic groups.\nThe study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain Injury , provides a comprehensive analysis of TBI-related deaths across different population groups across the U.S. in 2021.\nThe findings indicate that suicides remain the most common cause of TBI-related deaths, followed by unintentional falls, and specific groups are disproportionately affected by these tragedies.\nMen, in particular, were found to be most likely to die from a TBI – more than three times the rate of women (30.5 versus 9.4). The reasons observed were multifactorial and could reflect differences in injury severity following a fall or motor vehicle crash, to the interaction of sex and age – with TBI outcomes in men worsening with age, while postmenopausal women fare better than men of similar age.\n\"While anyone is at risk for getting a TBI, some groups have a higher chance than others of dying from one. We identified specific populations who are most affected. In addition to men, older adults are especially at risk, with unintentional falls being a major cause of TBI-related death. American Indian or Alaska Native people also have higher rates of these fatal injuries,\" says lead author Alexis Peterson PhD., of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"These findings highlight the importance of tailored prevention strategies to reach groups who may be at higher risk and the role healthcare providers can play in reducing TBI-related deaths through early intervention and culturally sensitive care.\"\nTBI remains a leading cause of injury-related death in the U.S. In 2020, TBIs were associated with around a quarter of all injury-related deaths. These injuries can result from a bump, blow, or jolt to the head that disrupts normal brain function, whether unintentional (such as motor vehicle crashes or accidental falls), self-inflicted harm, or related to an assault.\nUsing data from the National Vital Statistics System, the new analysis identified 69,473 TBI-related deaths among U.S. residents during 2021 — an average of 190 deaths per day. The age-adjusted TBI-related mortality rate was 19.5 per 100,000, representing an 8.8% increase from 2020.\nThrough statistical modeling, the researchers examined the simultaneous effect of multiple factors such as geographic region, sex, race and ethnicity, and age, on TBI-related mortality.\nKey findings include:\nOlder adults (75+) had the highest rates of TBI-related deaths, with unintentional falls being the most common cause in this age group. Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native individuals experienced the highest TBI-related death rate (31.5) compared to other racial and ethnic groups. There were 37,635 TBI-related deaths categorized as unintentional injuries (i.e., motor vehicle crashes, unintentional falls, unintentionally struck by or against an object, other). 30,801 were categorized as intentional injuries (i.e., all mechanisms of suicide and homicide). Children aged from birth to 17 years accounted for around 4% of TBI-related deaths (2,977). The authors emphasize the critical role of healthcare providers in preventing TBI-related deaths, particularly with groups at higher risk. \"By assessing patients who may be at higher risk for TBI, especially due to falls or mental health challenges, healthcare providers can make timely referrals and recommend culturally tailored interventions to prevent further injury or death,\" says Dr Peterson.\nPublic health efforts should focus on addressing the underlying causes of TBI-related deaths, such as unintentional falls and mental health crises, to help prevent further loss of life. \"TBIs remain a significant public health concern, especially among older adults, men, and certain racial and ethnic groups,\" says Peterson. \"CDC has proven resources that healthcare providers can use to not only reduce health disparities that increase the risk for TBI but also improve care for anyone affected by a TBI.\"\nThe authors note the COVID-19 pandemic could have influenced TBI-related death trends in 2021. They also acknowledge several limitations of this analysis, including potential misclassification or incomplete documentation of causes on death certificates, which may lead to inaccuracies in estimating TBI-related deaths.\n/Public Release.

    "text": "Lifestyle Health Jenna Fischer Filmed Mean Girls with a Broken Shoulder: 'Still in Physical Therapy for It' (Exclusive) “It was the wildest experience,” the actress tells PEOPLE of hiding her injury on screen By Vanessa Etienne Vanessa Etienne Vanessa Etienne is an Emerging Content Writer-Reporter for PEOPLE. People Editorial Guidelines and Dory Jackson Dory Jackson Dory Jackson is an Associate Editor for PEOPLE's digital TV team. While at the brand, she's had the opportunity to interview a long list of celebrities, from Kate Hudson to Pierce Brosnan to Billy Porter. She has also helped recap popular TV shows like 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,' 'Sister Wives' and 'Vanderpump Rules.' The New York-based Maryland native graduated from Randolph-Macon College in May 2016 with a focus on Communication Studies and Journalism. She came to PEOPLE in March 2021 after working at a number of major news companies, including Newsweek and Us Weekly. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on April 18, 2024 05:00PM EDT Close Jenna Fischer as Ms. Heron in Mean Girls. Photo: Jojo Whilden/Paramount Jenna Fischer revealed she filmed the new Mean Girls adaptation with a broken shoulder. Speaking with PEOPLE about reuniting her castmates in the all-new AT&T Business ad, the actress opened up about injuring herself during a ski trip and having to conceal it on screen. “I shot for one day on Mean Girls, and then I didn't have to shoot for a month,” the 50-year-old tells PEOPLE. “And in that month I went on a ski trip and I fell on a sidewalk and I broke my shoulder.” “So I had to shoot the rest of the movie with a very newly broken shoulder,” says Fischer, who plays Cady Heron’s mom in the musical comedy. The Office alum says the cast and crew were kind about accommodating her injury, noting that she couldn’t really move her right arm. “If you notice in the opening shot of the movie, I'm out in the middle of a field and Cady is singing, and I have a crossbody bag on. And I'm holding my crossbody bag,” she explains. “The reason I'm doing that is because I had to take my sling off. That was serving as a sling for me.” “So if you notice in the movie I am exclusively gesturing with my left arm. It was the wildest experience,” she continues. “So a big part of my role in Mean Girls was pretending I didn't have a broken shoulder.” Dev Patel Says He Broke His Hand While Filming Monkey Man: 'My Hand Was Like an Elephant’s Foot' Jenna Fischer.

Fischer says that she’s just now able to raise her arm above her head, one year after the injury. “I'm still in physical therapy for it. I'm still rehabbing it,” she says. “It's a complicated injury, as anyone who's injured their shoulder will tell you.” Despite the broken shoulder, Fischer says that filming Mean Girls was an “amazing experience” for her and she’s thrilled that the movie has been well received. “I was so excited about the reaction to that movie because the people in that movie were so genuinely kind and wonderful and talented,” she says. “That young cast was just outstanding and it was one of those things where, when you finish shooting it, you think to yourself, ‘Gosh, I hope this movie does well because this is a good group.’ You want the good guy to win, right? So I was really rooting for it.”",

They learned the woman had fallen elsewhere days prior, and she was in a great deal of pain Thursday morning, according to Schmitke.\nThe Vancouver Fire Department and Clark County’s Technical Rescue Team, a regional team that comprises Fire District 6, Vancouver Fire and Clark-Cowlitz Fire Rescue, also responded.\nRescue crews secured the woman to a backboard, Schmitke said, and used a rope system to haul her up the embankment.\nSchmitke said the rescue operation took about an hour; he called it a team effort.",

    "title": "New Additions to the Toaster Team Bring a Fresh Wave of Creativity and Innovation",
    "text": "This past year, the Toaster has welcomed two new staff members: Steven Bleau, the Makerspace Lab Specialist, and Emerson Ironstone, the Outreach and Interdisciplinary Program Specialist! The Toaster team is thrilled to invite them onboard and share their insights and skills, furthering our passions for research and innovation.\nWhat drew both Steven and Emerson to the Toaster was their own personal passions for making. During his time as a Product Design undergraduate student here at the University, Steven’s redesigned walker won the Overall Favorite category in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Challenge. He and his team graduated in 2021, and their walker has since become the foundation for their startup, Telo, which specializes in making ergonomic assisted walking devices.\n“I discovered the Toaster when I was showcasing my startup’s products, and learned about how the Toaster cultivates creative education and entrepreneurship,” says Steven. “Since then I’ve participated in events and panels, and when a position opened up to manage the makerspaces I knew I had to apply!”\nEmerson, a crafter themselves, discovered the intersection between making and educating. In 2020, they were pursuing their Master’s in Library and Information science, and took a class on using makerspaces in education.\n“The class’s focus was primarily on middle and high school libraries, but I was curious at how I’d integrate making into a variety of contexts,” says Emerson. “When I saw that the University of Minnesota was hiring someone to work with their makerspaces, I was very excited, and my excitement only grew as I started looking into the Toaster!”\nWe’re fortunate to have Steven and Emerson join our talented staff that fosters a unique community of creatives and innovators. Here at the Toaster, we pride ourselves on being an interdisciplinary resource for all students, where they’re welcomed to connect, ideate, make, and launch.\nAs the Outreach and Interdisciplinary Program Specialist, Emerson uses their unique strengths to further the Toaster’s existing programming, and bring more programming to the Makerspace and VR Studio in the Health Sciences Library (HSL). They’re especially passionate about encouraging connection and building confidence in students who are curious and creative.\n“At the Toaster, I’ve been looking at approachable, low-barrier-of-entry programs that help to build community among our students even if they don’t consider themselves ‘makers,’” they say. “For example, I held Bad Art Night in February, which was an absolute blast! I’ve also been trying to bring in faculty and staff from outside the Toaster to share their making expertise; we just had a Cross Stitch 101 workshop with Carolyn Bishoff, a Science and Math Liaison Librarian who previously led the Breakerspace.” Ultimately, Emerson hopes to bridge the gap between students and expert makers across disciplines and the University community.\nAs the Makerspace Lab Specialist, Steven is a little more hands-on with physical equipment. Being in any University library makerspace at any time, he easily corroborates the aforementioned low barrier of entry, highlighting the Toaster’s edge in the University resources.\n“The Toaster is a hub for all my hobbies,” says Steven. He explains that in running Telo, he’s always designing new products with media equipment like that of VR, and prototyping with makerspace technology like 3D printers. “Giving access to all of these tools and lowering that barrier to entry is the most exciting part to me.”\nBut aside from the Toaster being a positive space for students, Steven and Emerson agree that the Toaster has been an asset for their growth as well. Because we value creativity and leadership at the Toaster, and we’re enthused that our efforts for fostering both has come through to students and staff alike. Steven highlights how he’s both learned and taught in the Toaster, allowing him to explore connections and share experiences. Emerson similarly attests to how they’ve honed their skills in “teaching, leadership, project planning, communication, and so much more,” noting that being at the Toaster is unlike any other position they’ve previously held. In both cases, Steven and Emerson have, at its plainest, tried new things; they were both ultimately unafraid to explore above and beyond.\nAnd even in the short time Steven and Emerson have been with the Toaster, they’ve already gained advice to share with others looking to make a meaningful impact in their field, as well as stay connected with organizations like the Toaster.\nEmerson’s approach is that once we identify our passions, we should stay realistic about our goals. “We all have the capacity to do good work and make meaningful change; we just need to adjust our metrics for success. We might not end world hunger, for example, but maybe we can end hunger in our campus community,” they explain. “Find something that you are passionate about, figure out who around you is doing that work, and ask how you can get involved!”\nSteven similarly encourages such outreach, connection, and passion: “Be open to meeting new people and always look for new sources of inspiration—you can learn a lot from others. All it takes is for you to recognize how you can use your unique strengths and experiences to do the same for your field or cause.”\nTogether, Steven and Emerson embody the ethos of the Toaster, where innovation meets education, and creativity underpins our goals. In the brief time they’ve been with us, Steven and Emerson have already made a profound impact, helping the Toaster and its community grow. As we look forward with our new staff members, we eagerly anticipate how much we can further connect, make, ideate, and launch together.",

However, staying informed about business news can actually have a significant impact on our daily lives.\nFirst and foremost, being knowledgeable about business news can help us make informed decisions in our personal finances. Whether you are a working professional or a student just starting to manage your own money, understanding the latest developments in the business world can provide valuable insights into making smart investments, managing debt and credit cards, and planning for retirement.

This holds true for both business professionals and everyday consumers. With so many sources of information available, it can be challenging to sift through all the noise and find the most relevant and reliable updates. Fortunately, there are a variety of tools and technologies that make it easier than ever to stay informed on business news.\n1. News Aggregator Apps:\nNews aggregator apps such as Flipboard, SmartNews, Google News, or Apple News gather content from various sources, including traditional news outlets as well as social media platforms. These apps use algorithms to personalize the feed based on your interests, making it easier to access relevant business news quickly. They also offer a “one-stop-shop” experience by providing updates from multiple sources in one place.\n2. Social Media Platforms:\nSocial media has become an essential tool for staying updated on business news. Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook allow users to follow accounts specific to their industry or interest, making it easy to get real-time updates straight from the source. Users can also join groups related to their field of work where they can engage in discussions and share valuable information.\n3.Summarization Tools:\nWith so much content available online today, reading through lengthy articles or watching long videos may not always be feasible. Summarization tools such as Pocket or Instapaper help solve this problem by cur ating and summarizing articles, saving you time and effort. These tools also allow users to save important articles for later reading, eliminating the fear of missing out on noteworthy information.\n4. Business News Websites and Apps:\nMany traditional news outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, or Reuters offer websites and apps specifically dedicated to business news. These platforms provide comprehensive coverage of the latest industry developments, market trends, and expert analysis. Additionally, they often offer notifications or newsletters to keep users updated on breaking news.\n5. Podcasts:\nPodcasts have gained immense popularity in recent years due to its convenience and ability to cater to multitasking needs. Many industry experts host podcasts that cover relevant business topics ranging from finance and economics to marketing and leadership. Users can listen to these podcasts while commuting or doing other tasks—making it a hands-free way to stay updated.\n6. Newsletters:\nNewsletters are an excellent way to receive curated content straight to your inbox from trusted sources. Many news publications or blogs offer daily or weekly newsletters tailored specifically for business professionals. By subscribing to these newsletters, you can get the latest updates and insights delivered straight to your inbox without having to search for them actively.\nExamples of Companies That Have Made Headlines in the News\nStaying informed about business news is more important now than ever before. In today’s fast-paced world, every decision made by a company can have a lasting impact on its customers, employees, and the global market. This is why it’s crucial for individuals to stay updated on the latest business developments and the companies that are making headlines.\nIn this section, we will take a closer look at some notable companies that have recently grabbed attention in the news due to their actions or decisions.\n1. Tesla:\nTesla, headed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has been making waves in recent years with its innovative electric cars and renewable energy solutions. The company has been constantly making headlines for its ambitious goals of creating a sustainable future and disrupting the automobile industry. However, Tesla’s controversial CEO and his erratic behavior have also been raising concerns among investors and industry experts.\n2. Facebook:\nFacebook has become one of the biggest names in technology over the past decade but not without facing scrutiny from media outlets worldwide. From data privacy scandals to accusations of spreading fake news and misinformation, Facebook has been at the center of numerous controversies in recent years. These incidents serve as reminders of how powerful social media platforms can be in shaping public discourse and highlight the importance of responsible corporate governance.\n3. Amazon:\nAmazon is known for its dominance in e-commerce as well as its rapidly expanding presence in other markets such as cloud computing and brick-and-mortar retail stores. However, the company has faced criticism from both consumers and employees over issues like worker exploitation, tax avoidance, and questionable business practices. This has led to increased scrutiny of Amazon’s operations and the company’s impact on the economy and society.\n4. Uber:\nAs a leading ride-hailing company, Uber has disrupted the transportation industry with its technology-driven business model. However, Uber’s path to success has been riddled with controversies surrounding its workplace culture, safety standards, and legal battles over worker classification. These issues have raised questions about the gig economy and sparked debates on the responsibility of companies towards their employees in this new era of work.\n5. TikTok:\nTikTok is a popular short video sharing platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance. The app has gained widespread popularity among Gen Z users but has faced scrutiny from governments around the world due to concerns over data privacy and censorship. These controversies have threatened TikTok’s global expansion plans and have highlighted the challenges that multinational companies face when operating in different political landscapes.\nAnalyzing and Interpreting Business News: Tips and Tricks\nAnalyzing and interpreting business news is an essential skill for anyone looking to stay informed about the current state of the economy and how it may affect their personal or professional interests. With so much information available, it can be overwhelming to try and make sense of all the news articles, reports, and data that are constantly being published. However, with some helpful tips and tricks, you can become more efficient at analyzing business news and gaining valuable insights from it.\n1. Start with Reliable Sources: One of the first steps in analyzing business news is to make sure you are getting your information from trusted sources. This includes reputable newspapers, financial websites, and industry publications. Avoid relying on social media or blogs for your primary source of business news as they may not always provide accurate or unbiased information.\n2. Understand the Context: It’s important to understand the context of a particular piece of business news before jumping into any analysis. This means knowing what has happened in the past, who is involved, and what potential implications this news may have for different stakeholders. Take some time to research related events or developments before forming an opinion.\n3. Identify Key Players: Business news often involves various players such as companies, industries, political figures, or economic factors. To fully comprehend a particular story, it’s crucial to identify all the key players involved and how they relate to one another.\n4. Look Beyond Headlines: While headlines can grab our attention quickly, they often don’t tell us everything we need to know about a particular news item. It’s important to read the entire article and look for supporting data or quotes from experts to get a more comprehensive understanding of the story.\n5. Analyze Financial Data: Many business news articles include financial data such as stock prices, earnings reports, or economic indicators. Take the time to examine these figures and use them to form your own conclusions about the state of a company or industry.\n6. Consider Multiple Perspectives: Business news can be subjective, and different sources may provide varying perspectives on the same story. Make sure to read and compare different viewpoints to get a well-rounded understanding of the topic at hand.\n7. Look at Long-term Trends: While it’s essential to stay current with breaking business news, it’s also crucial to consider long-term trends in the economy and specific industries. This will help you gain a broader perspective on how current events fit into the bigger picture.\n8. Seek Expert Opinions: When trying to make sense of complex business news, it can be helpful to seek out expert opinions from analysts, economists, or industry insiders. This can provide valuable insights that you may not have considered otherwise.\nConnecting with Other Professionals Through Business News Discussions\nIn today’s fast-paced business world, staying informed and up-to-date on the latest news and trends is crucial for success. But it’s not just about keeping yourself in-the-know – connecting with other professionals through business news discussions can also be extremely beneficial.\nOne of the greatest advantages of participating in business news discussions is the opportunity to expand your network. By engaging with others who are also interested in or knowledgeable about certain topics, you have the chance to build meaningful connections and potentially form mutually beneficial relationships. These new connections can open doors to future collaborations, career opportunities, and provide valuable insights and perspectives.\nAdditionally, discussing current business news with other professionals allows for a deeper understanding of complex issues and developments. While reading articles or watching news segments alone can provide some level of understanding, talking about these topics with others can bring different viewpoints and expertise to the table. This collaborative learning process can lead to more well-rounded insights, helping you make more informed decisions for your own business or career.\nFurthermore, participating in business news discussions helps you stay on top of industry\ntrends and changes that could impact your work or industry. In a constantly evolving business landscape, this knowledge is essential for staying competitive and adapting to new challenges. Engaging in conversations with other professionals allows for a broader perspective on emerging trends and potential disruptions that may affect your field. This awareness enables you to be proactive rather than reactive in making necessary adjustments within your organization.\nConclusion\nAs we have seen, staying informed about business news and current events is crucial for both professionals and individuals. It not only keeps us updated on the latest developments in the dynamic world of business but also allows us to make better decisions, whether it’s regarding our career or personal investments. With easy access to information through various sources, there is no excuse not to stay informed and use knowledge as a powerful tool for success in today’s fast-paced business landscape. So keep yourself updated and embrace the power of knowledge!",

    "text": "Agricultores llaman a 'bloquear' París este viernes Entre las exigencias figuran una ayuda de emergencia a los sectores en crisis; una flexibilización de las normas medioambientales, como las relativas al uso de pesticidas; compensación económica por el aumento de la tasa del diésel de uso agrícola, etc. - Redacción AN / ARF Agricultores franceses han organizado operaciones de bloqueo con tractores en las autopistas que conducen a París. El jueves ,bloquearon la A12 y la A13, dos grandes arterias, mientras que otros tractores se concentraron en las ciudades de los alrededores de la capital. A excepción de un agricultor solitario de la región de Brie, que subió con su tractor por los Campos Elíseos hasta el Arco del Triunfo y fue escoltado por la policía, París se ha librado hasta ahora de las protestas. “Es un grito de alarma, un grito desde el corazón”, dijo el agricultor, con la esperanza de recordar al presidente Emmanuel Macron que los agricultores viven y trabajan cerca. “Iremos a París” La protesta, iniciada hace una semana en el sur del país, amenaza con llegar a la capital si el gobierno del presidente Emmanuel Macron no responde al mundo agrícola. El principal sindicato del sector, la FNSEA, envió el miércoles 24 demandas. Entre las exigencias figuran una ayuda de emergencia a los sectores en crisis; una flexibilización de las normas medioambientales, como las relativas al uso de pesticidas; compensación económica por el aumento de la tasa del diésel de uso agrícola, etc. La sección de la región parisina del sindicato de agricultores FNSEA, así como el sindicato de Jóvenes Agricultores de la región, han instado a los trabajadores agrícolas a bloquear las entradas y salidas de París a partir de las 14:00 horas del viernes.

El Salón de la Agricultura 2024 se realizará en el Parque de Exposiciones de la Puerta de Versalles, en el sur de París, del 24 de febrero al 3 de marzo de 2024. El Primer Ministro, Gabriel Attal, convocó a los ministros de Economía, Medio Ambiente y Agricultura a una reunión el jueves para decidir las medidas de ayuda. Se espera que esas medidas se anuncien el viernes. (RFI)",
