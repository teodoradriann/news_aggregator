    "text": "Polonia, miles de personas en los conciertos de alabanza del Corpus Christi\nP. Paweł Rytel-Andrianik y P. Jakub Nagi - Ciudad del Vaticano\n«El concierto es una forma de oración en la que lo más importante es Cristo». Los organizadores de los conciertos de alabanza del Corpus Christi no lo dudan, «es Él quien reúne a tanta gente para la alabanza común tanto in situ» y probablemente por eso las retransmisiones y la información de los medios de comunicación llegaron a millones de personas en Polonia y en todo el mundo.\nConcierto de tres horas\nEl concierto «Un corazón y un espíritu» de Rzeszów reunió a 25.000 personas de Polonia y otros países europeos. Participaron casi 200 artistas, entre coristas, solistas, instrumentistas y voluntarios. Durante las tres horas que duró la actuación, los participantes escucharon 26 canciones y obras religiosas. Los asistentes fueron recibidos por el padre Andrzej Cypryś, uno de los creadores y organizadores del concierto, así como por el director musical Marcin Pospieszalski y el presentador Jan Budziaszek. Al final, monseñor Jan Wątroba, obispo de Rzeszów, dio la bendición.\nUna llamada a los jóvenes\nLos conciertos de alabanza en la fiesta del Corpus Christi, en los que muchos jóvenes participan también como parejas, son cada vez más frecuentes en Polonia, tanto en las grandes ciudades como en los pueblos pequeños, y también se cuelan en los medios de comunicación y en las redes sociales, donde muchas personas publican sus historias.\nGracias por haber leído este artículo.

    "title": "Atlanta activist pushes for more mentorship programs to curb youth violence",
    "text": "ATLANTA - An Atlanta anti-violence activist says more funding and investment in mentorship programs is needed to address growing youth gun violence in the metro area. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , gun violence is the leading cause of death for Black men ages 15 to 24. Omar Howard has worked to help curb that trend ever since he was released from prison after serving 15 years. He founded Freedom is a Choice Inc. in 2011, a mentoring service for at-risk young men and women. Howard gives speeches at schools, community centers, and juvenile detention centers. \"They&apos;ve already given up on people like us who&apos;ve been through the process … but we want to work with these types of young men …. because the potential these young men have, we still see it. When some people in society don&apos;t see it,\" Howard said. Howard saw potential in Jerious Smith, who landed in juvenile detention when he was 15. \"I did some time for armed robbery,\" Smith said. Smith said Howard gave a class to him and the other juvenile detainees. At first, he just went for the food, but then Howard&apos;s message that it wasn&apos;t too late to choose to turn his life around started to sink in. Now he’s an entrepreneur. \"I got a dog business, now officially got a business. CBMW Kennels, and I’m the owner of it,\" Smith said. Khalil Jeffries says Howard gave him mentorship and encouragement that he and many others like him are missing in their lives. \"He became a real role model to me, and I don’t got a lot of role models,\" Jeffries said. Howard took some of his mentees on a service trip to Guatemala, where they helped build a house for a family there. Ny’ontae Thrasher went on that trip and says it was life-changing. \"These folks are going through way worse than what we going through now. I’m really grateful and thankful,\" Thrasher said. But Howard says trips like that aren’t cheap, and he wishes he could expand his operation by hiring more mentors with real-life experience. \"A lot of people are willing to do it, but they don’t have the time to do it because they got to pay bills … We’re trying to get the funding to at least do stipends or be able to hire somebody part-time or full-time,\" Howard said. He says they do get grants from local governments to help with funding, but even that can be costly when he has to hire a grant writer to help him get them. Howard hopes in the new year that local businesses will help sponsor programs like his to help them reach more young people in crisis. He says he hopes business owners considering doing this will see it as a true investment, because he believes the more young people they can help turn away from crime and violence, the safer it will be for the communities owners operate in. \"When you invest in these types of organizations, you will see the results. You&apos;ll see that your money went to a good, good cause,\" he said. Howard can be reached at freedomisachoice2012@gmail.com .",
