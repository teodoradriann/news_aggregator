    "text": "Illinois basketball star Terrence Shannon Jr. has been suspended from all team activities after he was charged with rape. A warrant was issued for Shannon’s arrest on Wednesday by the Douglas County district attorney’s office in Kansas. Shannon turned himself in on Thursday on a charge of “rape; sexual intercourse without consent and use of force,” according to ESPN’s Myron Medcalf . The senior posted $50,000 bail and planned to return to Illinois. Illinois said in a statement that the alleged incident took place in September when Shannon was in Lawrence, Kansas, to attend the Illinois-Kansas State football game. Shannon was “not in Lawrence on official University business, nor was he a member of the University’s travel party,” according to the school. University officials said they were aware of the investigation involving Shannon but that they did not receive “actionable information” until the arrest warrant was issued. Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said the school has “zero tolerance for sexual misconduct” but that student-athletes are afforded “appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations.” Shannon’s attorney, Mark P. Sutter, said in a statement that Shannon has cooperated with authorities since the allegations were made in September. Sutter said Shannon is “innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.” Shannon, who transferred to Illinois from Texas Tech following the 2020-21 season, is averaging a team-high 21.7 points per game. He has been the 11th-ranked Illini’s best player. The post Illinois star Terrence Shannon Jr. suspended following rape charge appeared first on Larry Brown Sports . Want more great sports stories?

El miércoles, Richard Slayman, de 62 años, el líder mundial El primer ser humano vivo que recibió un riñón de cerdo genéticamente modificado pudo regresar a casa desde el hospital. El nuevo riñón de Slayman parece ser funcionando como se esperaba dos semanas después de la cirugía.\nAsí es por dentro la Kings League\nShare\nShare this Video\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nReddit\nLink\nview video Así es por dentro la Kings League, el 'circo' futbolero de Gerard Piqué que ha conquistado Twitch\nEl trasplante de animal a humano, o xenotrasplante, se ha convertido en una vía prometedora para abordar la escasez de larga data de órganos donados, aunque se necesitan muchos décadas para llegar a este punto. Innovaciones recientes en la tecnología de edición genética han hecho posible que los científicos creen cerdos que sean más compatibles con la biología humana. Y la esperanza es que los órganos de estos cerdos puedan ser tolerados de forma segura por el sistema inmunológico del receptor.\nPublicidad En los últimos años se han realizado varias pruebas tempranas exitosas de esta tecnología en humanos, pero estos experimentos se han realizado en gran medida. en animales y personas declaradas con muerte cerebral, cuyos cuerpos sus familiares han permitido que se mantengan mecánicamente vivos durante un tiempo mientras el órgano donado monitoreado. En marzo de 2022, David Bennett, de 57 años, con una enfermedad terminal el primer ser humano vivo del mundo en recibir un corazón de cerdo genéticamente modificado , pero murió sólo dos meses después. En octubre pasado, el segundo receptor vivo de un corazón de cerdo modificado, Lawrence Faucette, de 58 años , fallecido un mes después de su procedimiento.\nPublicidad Al igual que Bennett y Faucette, a Slayman se le permitió someterse a este procedimiento experimental debido a sus opciones limitadas. Durante mucho tiempo se ha ocupado de la tipografía. 2 diabetes e hipertensión y recibió un riñón donado típico en 2018. Sin embargo, para 2023, el riñón había comenzado a fallar. Una vez Cuando lo cambiaron a diálisis, comenzó a experimentar complicaciones recurrentes que requirieron visitas regulares al hospital para controlarlas. Ante la probable perspectiva de sufrir Tras una larga espera por un segundo riñón humano, Slayman acordó recibir en su lugar un trasplante de riñón de cerdo.\nPublicidad El trasplante fue realizado por médicos del Hospital General de Massachusetts, que han realizado experimentos previos de riñón de cerdo, utilizando un riñón procedente de un cerdo desarrollado por la empresa de biotecnología eGenesis. Los científicos eliminaron tres genes de cerdo y agregaron siete genes humanos para mejorar la compatibilidad del cerdo. También inactivaron varios retrovirus endógenos porcinos, que están integrados en el genoma de cada cerdo. Algunas pruebas han sugerido que una infección previamente no detectada causada por El citomegalovirus porcino podría haber contribuido a la muerte de David Bennett.\nSlayman experimentó síntomas de rechazo celular ocho días después del procedimiento, una complicación común del trasplante, pero sus médicos pudieron tratarlo con esteroides y otros medicamentos que debilitan el sistema inmunológico. Hasta ahora, el nuevo riñón de Slayman parece estar funcionando como se esperaba, filtrando los productos de desecho y produciendo orina. Y ahora se ha recuperado lo suficientemente bien como para ser enviado a casa.\nPublicidad “Este momento, al salir hoy del hospital con uno de los mejores resultados de salud que he tenido en mucho tiempo, es uno que deseaba. vendría por muchos años», dijo Slayman en un declaración del Hospital General de Massachusetts. “Ahora es una realidad y uno de los momentos más felices de mi vida”.\nTomará tiempo saber si el cuerpo de Slayman aceptará el nuevo órgano a largo plazo. E incluso si este trasplante es tan exitoso como Se necesitarán posibles ensayos clínicos a mayor escala de esta tecnología antes de que pueda estar disponible para el público. Algunos científicos también argumentó que pasarán muchos años más antes de que estos órganos de cerdo modificados puedan ser tan duraderos como los de donantes humanos. Por ahora, hay motivos para ser optimistas.\nPublicidad “El éxito de este trasplante es la culminación de los esfuerzos de miles de científicos y médicos a lo largo de varias décadas. Tenemos el privilegio de tener jugado un papel importante en este hito. Nuestra esperanza es que este enfoque de trasplante ofrezca un salvavidas a millones de pacientes en todo el mundo que sufriendo de insuficiencia riñón», dijo Tatsuo Kawai, director del Centro Legorreta para la tolerancia clínica a trasplante en MGH, en un declaración del hospital la semana pasada.\nEste contenido ha sido traducido automáticamente del material original.

Un tirano que asesinó a toda la oposició política del país y patrocinó atentados y células terroristas en Europa.

El último ejecutado por garrote vil fue asesinado en 1974, y los fusilamientos siguieron hasta prácticamente el último suspiro del ciclán.\ncc/\n[#3](c3#c-3)\n[#13](c13#c-13) La resolución 1973 del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, aprobada el 17 de marzo de 2011, autorizó a «tomar todas las medidas necesarias» en Libia para «proteger a los civiles y a las áreas pobladas bajo amenaza de ataques», incluyendo la creación de una zona de exclusión aérea sobre el país.1 La resolución excluyó explícitamente la intervención terrestre en cualquier parte de Libia , todo amparado por la ONU. haber si te crees que gadafi solo daba abrazos\nexplotado de forma conjunta entre la NOC, la francesa Total SE, la española Repsol SA, la austriaca OMV AG y la noruega Equinor ASA\nsaqueado, se dice saqueado... por el \"jardín occidental\" que necesita oro negro para poner en marcha el cortacesped\n[#1](c1#c-1) \"cuando una revuelta armada derrocó al antiguo líder del país, Muamar Gadafi\".\nNO, cuando la OTAN encabezada por la demócrata de Clinton le asesinó, Francia se quedó con el dinero que debía a Gadafi y quienes realmente deciden la política mundial, las oligarquías occidentales, la saquean, pero los \"demócratas\" mundiales nunca pagaran por el daño que llevan haciendo en el mundo desde que existen.\nEl saqueo es el saqueo. Y todo lo demás que pasa en la región, no es más que \"armas de destrucción masiva\". A Venezuela me remito. Las mismas sucias zarpas de las multinacionales petroleras y gasistas por todo el globo. Masacrando civiles y ensuciando la convivencia a cambio de beneficios multimillonarios. El ascenso de la ultraderecha internacional no es más que eso: los fascistas y sus voceros solo son peones y brazos armados de las multinacionales y en defensa de los intereses del 1% de multimillonarios y en contra del 99% de la población que debe someterse a su neofeudalismo global.",

    "title": "Big screens scoring with Michigan National Championship game broadcast",
    "text": "Movie theaters across Metro Detroit have already scored with University of Michigan fans wanting to watch Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship game on the big screen. Trevor Baker, chief operating officer of Emagine Entertainment, says the company — which will show Monday's game in theaters at eight locations in Metro Detroit, as well as a pair of theaters in Indiana — had sold around 1,500 tickets for the game as of Friday, at $20 a pop. He says sales have increased day-over-day every day since they went on sale Tuesday , following Michigan's 27-20 win over Alabama in Monday's Rose Bowl, which sent the Wolverines to the National Championship game against the University of Washington Huskies.\n\"We were curious: Would somebody pay money to come see something they can see for free on TV? And we felt they would,\" says Baker, whose theaters also showed last week's Rose Bowl game in its auditoriums, and has found success with broadcasts of UFC and pro wrestling events in the past. \"Events like this are meant for community and sharing, and what's better than going and seeing the game on a larger than life screen, getting food and beverage, and not having to clean up afterwards?\"\nEmagine, as well as other area theaters showing the game, are doing so in partnership with Theater Sports Network of Salt Lake City, which partners with media rights owners and exhibitors to bring live sporting events to movie theaters. The National Championship game is part of an agreement between ESPN and the Theater Sports Network which has brought approximately 75 games during the 2023-24 college football season to theater screens nationwide.\nTicket sales for Monday's game — kickoff is 7:30 p.m. at Houston's NRG Stadium — have been \"outstanding\" at MJR Theatres, says MJR's director of marketing, Anthony Taylor. Earlier this week, MJR reps announced they would show the game at three area theaters, and have since added a fourth theater to meet demand.\n\"This has been unquestionably the best selling live sporting event that we’ve seen, and I think it reinforces the desire for a shared cinematic experience for live events,\" Taylor says.\nSales have been \"soft so far\" at the Ford-Wyoming Drive-In in Dearborn, says Courtney Clark, the theater's manager of marketing and social media. But she expects to see an uptick in sales over the weekend and into Monday, as long as weather cooperates, and because of the theater's unique tailgating opportunities. (Coolers are barbecues are welcome, she says.)\nMichigan Theater executive director Russ Collins says he expects between 1,300 and 1,400 people at the downtown Ann Arbor theater for Monday's game, two to three times the number that were there for the Rose Bowl game. Part of that is because students are back on campus Monday, after being absent over the holidays, and he expects a full house as Michigan vies for its first National Championship since 1997.\n\"It'll be a really good, packed event,\" he says.\nagraham@detroitnews.com",
