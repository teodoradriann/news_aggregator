    "text": "News\nDistrito Escolar de Santa Ana suspende excursiones por tercera semana debido a redadas de ICE\nEl Distrito Escolar Unificado de Santa Ana ha suspendido todas las excursiones de verano por tercera semana consecutiva debido a las continuas redadas federales de inmigración en la zona.\n\"Tengan en cuenta que ninguna escuela, programa escolar ni actividad afiliada al distrito ha sido blanco de agentes federales, y no prevemos que lo sea\", declaró el portavoz del distrito, Fermín Leal. \"Sin embargo, se han presentado interrupciones relacionadas con la aplicación de la ley en los vecindarios de nuestro distrito\".\nLa decisión, tomada semanalmente por los administradores del distrito junto con el equipo de aprendizaje extendido, los directores de verano y la oficina del superintendente, se reevaluará el próximo lunes, afirmó Leal.\n\"Creemos que lo mejor para nuestros estudiantes es mantener todas las actividades de verano en el campus por ahora\", añadió.\nEsta medida se produce mientras continúan las redadas de inmigración realizadas por agentes federales en todo el Condado de Orange, con la Guardia Nacional estacionada en el centro de Santa Ana y algunos negocios reportando fuertes caídas en las ventas y el tráfico peatonal.\n\"Tienen miedo de volver a casa y no encontrar a nadie\", dijo Diana López, psicóloga del distrito escolar, refiriéndose a sus estudiantes en una reciente reunión del Ayuntamiento, donde cientos de residentes exigieron al alcalde una postura más firme contra las redadas. \"Algunos de nuestros estudiantes nunca han salido de la ciudad y estas excursiones les importan, pero el miedo a la deportación es muy grande en este momento\".\nEl Distrito Escolar Unificado de Garden Grove lanzó la semana pasada una línea de ayuda atendida por enlaces escolares bilingües para conectar a las familias con organizaciones de servicios legales y sociales, recursos alimentarios y apoyo emocional.\nWalter Muneton, miembro de la junta directiva del Distrito Escolar Unificado de Garden Grove, explicó que la línea de ayuda está diseñada para familias que podrían tener miedo de salir de casa para acceder a recursos.\n\"Existe el miedo de salir de casa e ir de un punto A a un punto B\", dijo Muneton. \"Por eso, si podemos brindar un recurso por teléfono, podemos ayudar a nuestras familias para que puedan acceder a los recursos sin tener que salir físicamente de casa\".\nLa línea estará atendida en español y vietnamita de 8:00 a. m. a 4:30 p. m., de lunes a viernes. Hay apoyo en árabe y coreano disponible previa solicitud.\n\"No se ofrece asesoramiento legal por teléfono\", dijo Muneton. \"Esta línea de ayuda ofrece apoyo emocional y orientación, y ofrecemos una perspectiva de gestión de casos para conectarlos con nuestros colaboradores de confianza\".\n\"Actualmente hay tanta información disponible\", añadió Muneton, \"que queremos simplificarles el proceso y brindarles directamente lo que necesitan\".\nPuede comunicarse con la línea de ayuda del distrito al 714-663-6257.\n-------",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "'Not going to happen': Senator explains why Trump’s entreaties to Black voters won’t work",
    "text": "Frontpage news and politics Former President Donald Trump is hoping to attract a new segment of the American electorate that's typically been a reliable cornerstone of the Democratic base — Black voters. But one Black U.S. senator is doubtful Trump's outreach will yield any significant results. In a recent interview with Semafor, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia), who won five elections over two years largely due to African American turnout, said that Black voters are too smart to fall for the ex-president's efforts to court them. However, he acknowledged that high Black voter turnout will determine whether Democrats keep the White House and the U.S. Senate in November. \"This idea that throngs of Black folks are going to vote for Donald Trump, it’s just not true,\" Warnock said. \"It’s not going to happen.\" READ MORE: 'Voters aren't holding their breath': Dems slam 'con artist' Trump over economic promises \"[Black voters] recognize the existential threat that Donald Trump represents,\" he continued. \"What we’ve got to do is help people see between now and November that this is going to be a close election, and if we don’t turn out, we could see this man, this dangerous man, back in the White House.\" One example Warnock cited of Black Americans' skepticism for Trump was his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which a 2020 study from the Health and Human Rights Journal found disproportionately impacted Black people .). According to the study, nearly 98 out of every 100,000 African Americans who tested positive for Covid-19 died, which is full third higher than the mortality rate for the Latino population (64.7 per 100,000) and more than double the mortality rate for whites (46.6 per 100,000) and the Asian population (40.4 per 100,000). “What I remember is a feckless president standing in front of the American people, lying on a regular basis, every day, downplaying the tragic impact of all of this, saying that when it got warm, it was just going to go away, disappear like magic,” the Georgia Democrat told Semafor. “Well, it didn’t disappear like magic.” Health policy may come up in tonight's debate in Atlanta, Georgia, which will be the first between President Joe Biden and his predecessor of the general election season. Warnock said he was \"looking forward\" to the event because \"it’s going to be a good reminder for people of what they had in Donald Trump.\" READ MORE: 'We see him': Columnist says Trump's appeals to Black voters are 'insults' “The man’s got 34 felony counts. He’s got 91 charges. He’s a little bit busy trying to take care of himself,\" Warnock said. \"And as I talk to Georgians in general and Black Georgians in particular, they’re thinking about their family. They’re thinking about their concerns.” Trump's efforts to appeal to Black voters have largely been panned for being disingenuous and casually racist. During a February rally prior to the South Carolina Republican primary, Trump said his multiple criminal indictments were a reason why \" the Black people like me ,\" and argued that his prosecutions help him with Black people \"because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against and they actually viewed me as being discriminated against, it's — it's been pretty amazing.\" Click here to read Semafor's report in its entirety.
