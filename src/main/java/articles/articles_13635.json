    "text": "Justin Bieber sparks concern among fans after worrying appearance in New York\nJustin Bieber has appeared to ditch his longer hair in favor of a new buzz cut as he was spotted looking tired as he walked through New York City on Wednesday.\nPop sensation Justin Bieber was barely recognizable as he stepped out in New York City on Wednesday.\nThe Canadian heartthrob embarked on his city adventure without his wife, Hailey Bieber, 28, but was accompanied by a group of people.\nThe new father appeared weary as he strolled through the city, showcasing a dramatic buzz cut.\nThe 30-year-old singer donned his signature oversized attire, pairing a bright yellow hoodie with beige pants.\nHe seemed to be holding up his trousers at the crotch to prevent them from slipping down, yet they still dragged on the ground beneath his standout fuzzy footwear.\nJustin's exhausted look could be attributed to the demands of first-time parenthood, following the recent birth of his son, Jack Blues, with Hailey.\nThe sighting came after insiders told the Daily Mail that Justin's wife Hailey's friends are growing increasingly concerned about Justin's actions.\nAccording to the source, some of her inner circle is encouraging Hailey to leave the musician after 'putting up with a lot' since their marriage began.\nDON'T MISS...\n[Justin Bieber breaks silence after 'suss' Hailey Bieber unfollowing move [COMMENT]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/161168/justin-bieber-breaks-silence-sus)\n[Justin Bieber 'working on new music' after he unfollows stars on Instagram [LATEST]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/161060/justin-bieber-new-music-Instagram)\n[Justin Bieber surprises fans with shirtless snap as they spot detail [PICTURES]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/160838/justin-bieber-Calvin-Klein-underwear-instagram)\nThe couple announced the arrival of their baby boy on August 23, 2024, shortly after Hailey unveiled her pregnancy in May with a breathtaking photoshoot.\nHailey and Justin exchanged vows in 2018, but their family dynamics shifted after the birth of Jack Blues. Reportedly, Hailey decided to keep her son away from her parents following a fallout when she became pregnant.\nJustin has unfollowed his father-in-law, Stephen Baldwin, on social media, who has yet to reciprocate the action.\nDespite this apparent lack of familial support, sources have claimed that Justin and his wife Hailey are extremely happy together as they navigate first-time parenthood, even referring to it as a \"learning experience\".\nHailey herself has publicly expressed her happiness with Justin, despite persistent rumors of an impending divorce.\nHowever, an insider close to the couple suggested to the Daily Mail last week that after the initial joy of welcoming their son, the pair may be experiencing difficulties once more.\n\"Hailey's been struggling with Justin almost since the start of the marriage,\" the source revealed.\n\"She loves him madly but he's a loose cannon. Some of her friends have advised her to go it alone and leave him. His behavior is sometimes unacceptable. She's put up with a lot.\"\nThe source further added that the birth of their son, Jack Blues, seemed to bring about a positive change, but friends are now witnessing things deteriorate again.\nDespite the swirling rumors, Hailey remains firm that all is well with Justin. \"People have made me feel so bad about my relationship since day one,\" she confessed to W Magazine last year.\nFollow Daily Express US\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\nSign up for our newsletters HERE.",

Le tenemos un cariño enorme quienes habitualmente participamos en ese foro.\n\"Algunos de los mártires fueron directamente ejecutados, otros decapitados, y a otros se les amputaron sus extremidades superiores e inferiores o su zona abdominal completamente abierta\"\n\"algunos de los cadáveres habían sido encontrados con las manos y los pies atados\"\n\"Había señales de ejecuciones en el terreno; no sabemos si fueron enterrados vivos o ejecutados\"\n[#1](c1#c-1) Lo que han debido sufrir esas personas. Amputaciones de extremidades estando vivos, vientres rajados. Seguramente serían civiles\ntorturados para que dieran información, y ni así consiguen encontrar a Hamás, prueba de que han torturado a cientos de civiles que no tenían info. Nadie soporta tal tipo de tortura.\nIsrael genocidos hijos de la grandísima puta, son el auténtico diablo.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Llevan 80 años haciendo barbaridades con el pueblo palestino.

    "text": "TEXAS, USA — The chair of the Texas Medical Board said Thursday it is not the group's role to give doctors legal clarity on the state's strict new abortion law. This comes after a call from the state Supreme Court for it to establish guidelines contained within the [controversial ruling in the Kate Cox case. ](/article/news/local/texas-abortion-case-woman-flees-state-permission-halted-paused/287-9ad29dbd-c8f7-4da2-8004-657f462432ec) Dr. Sherif Zaafran, a Houston anesthesiologist, said the board cannot give clarity on the issue because that is beyond the scope of what it is permitted to do under the law. In an interview with WFAA, Zaafran declined to say definitively whether the medical board would eventually give further guidance on medical exceptions to the state's abortion law, citing ongoing litigation. \"I'm not sure how helpful it would be one way or the other,\" he said. \"In the past, when we issue guidance, not following that guidance didn't necessarily mean that you could be prosecuted in court still.\" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office issued an advisory last year warning doctors who perform abortions in the state could face felony charges, unless the pregnancy puts a woman's life at risk or poses a serious risk of impairing a major bodily function. In early December, Cox, a Dallas native, asked a judge to allow her to terminate her pregnancy because the fetus wouldn't survive. The Texas Supreme Court ruled against her Dec. 11, but asked the medical board to provide additional guidance. \"The board could assess various hypothetical circumstances, provide best practices, identify red lines, and the like,\" the justices wrote. \"While the judiciary cannot compel executive branch entities to do their part, it is obvious that the legal process works more smoothly when they do.\" Zaafran said the board is constrained by the letter of the law, which gives individual doctors the leeway to determine what constitutes a life-threatening diagnosis, but doesn't provide for the medical board to weigh in beyond its existing role adjudicating complaints against doctors. \"I understand there is a desire for the medical board to give more clarity,\" he said. \"That is not our role. We can not give more clarity because that is beyond the scope of what we as an executive agency can do.\" Zaafran said he believes the legislature should handle hypothetical scenarios for doctors and that the medical board could further advise physicians if future court rulings alter the interpretation of the law. \"It's not passing the buck, it's clarifying what our role is and to what extent we can enforce the law as it is written,\" Zaafran said. Cox's attorneys were not available for comment this week. The mother of two received an abortion out of state in mid-December.",

    "title": "How One Cumin-sized Seed Can Grow A Fish Weighing 2 Kg - News18",
    "text": "There are thousands of fish lovers in our country. The trend of growing fish farming is growing day by day. It is claimed by many as a successful business that yields a decent amount of profit. In recent days, the government has provided subsidies for fish farming which has resulted in the significant increase of fish traders. Usually, the sellers deal in fish seeds of three different sizes: jeera, finger and big. The most commonly used size is jeera. It might be strange for you to know that jeera-sized seeds grow into fish that weigh 1.5kgs to 2kgs. But do you know how long it takes for a fish to grow to its full size? In this article, we will talk about some facts of fish farming. In an interview with Local 18, Sudhir Sahni, a major fish businessman mentioned this business emerged to become very profitable. He owns 90 acres of land where he runs his business. He explained that at first, the pond is cleaned and then the jeera seeds are added. He added that there are many medicines available in the market to make the fish big but it depends on the sellers whether to use it or not. Sudhir advised that one should put the seeds slowly as if all the seeds are added to the water at once then the success rate decreases. There are many species of fish found in India, but there are three major species that fall under the Indian Major Carp (IMC). The major fishes include catla (Catla catla), rohu (Labeo rohita) and mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala). It takes around nine months to grow IMC fish. Sudhir further mentioned that foreign fish like Pangasius and Senapia take around six months to grow to their full size. The procedure also highly depends on the skill of the farmer. Sudhir further added that when fish farmers lease a pond, they know that fish can only be harvested once or at most twice in a year. The pond is prepared accordingly first then the seeds are added. After a month, the farmers also can add another batch of seeds. The water should be cleaned using nets regularly. It is also vital to keep the fish active. Adding to it, he mentioned that allowing cattle to enter the water also makes the fish more active. It helps in the quick growth of their bodies. The weight can reach more than 2kgs in a year.",

    "title": "\"Vamos a entregar un país con más guerra que el que recibimos\": Iván Name",
    "text": "&quot;Vamos a entregar un país con más guerra que el que recibimos&quot;: Iván Name En el marco de su rendición de cuentas como presidente del Senado, Iván Name salió en defensa del Congreso, al definirlo como la primera autoridad política en la democracia. “Hay quienes creen que el Congreso es una empresita más del Estado. Hoy no estamos aquí a la carrerita dando un informe sobre el Congreso. Este es el sostén de esta democracia. El Palacio de Nariño tiene que mirar con respeto las columnas del Capitolio y el Capitolio con respeto a la izquierda, al Palacio de Nariño, me gusta voltear a mirar las cúpulas del poder Judicial, de las sotanas negras. En cualquiera de las tres puede haber equivocaciones, pero son los hombres, no son las instituciones”, señaló Name. A partir de esto, Name aseguró que el problema del país no es el presidente Gustavo Petro, este se lo atribuyó a los extremos políticos. “El problema de este país no es Petro, como tratan algunos de hacerlo ver. Petro ha agravado las circunstancias del país en muchos temas. El problema nuestro es la estructura misma, el presidencialismo. Ni la izquierda ni la derecha le han propuesto salir al país de la guerra. La derecha propone más ejército, más balas, Es un extremo a extremo, no salimos del tic tac de la guerra”, agregó. Así mismo el presidente del Senado afirmó, de igual manera, que el país tuvo un incremento en las cifras de violencia en el último periodo. “Vamos a entregar un país con más guerra que el que recibimos. No es el narcotráfico el origen de nuestras guerras, este llegó después de tantas guerras porque ya hacían parte de nuestra historia”, afirmó. Sobre el escándalo de la Unidad Nacional de Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres, dónde se le acusa de recibir más de 3.000 millones de pesos para aprobar las reformas del Gobierno, aseguró que tuvo que mantener un perfil bajo por respeto al Congreso, pero que ya está listo para dar sus declaraciones. “Yo ya estoy montado en una cruz y crucificado. Ya fuimos lapidados y condenados por algunos porque no es nuestra sociedad ni nuestra nación. Voy a atravesar la plaza de Bolívar, a las sotanas negras, de mi juez, la Corte Suprema, a dar las declaraciones. Tengo tranquila mi conciencia”, afirmó. Frente a dichas reformas sociales del Gobierno, Name aseguró que como presidente, uno de sus objetivos era brindar garantías y, así mismo, asegurarse de que no fueran aprobadas leyes inconvenientes. “Sí hubo un opositor y no apoyó las reformas del gobierno, fui yo como presidente. El éxito no está en la cantidad de leyes aprobadas, también está en cuántas no pasaron porque no convenía”, señaló. Name aseguró que no está en la búsqueda de su reelección, asegurando “No sé si vuelva al Senado, ya han sido muchos períodos”. Ante esta declaración, señaló que su inclinación para la presidencia en la próxima legislatura, está por el senador Efraín Cepeda. “Espero que el próximo presidente sea Iván Cepeda, que ha sido respaldado por los partidos y las bancadas. El presidente Cepeda, de ser elegido, seguro continuará con el modelo de reunir semanalmente a los voceros, es conveniente”, agregó.",

    "title": "El PP acusa Yolanda Díaz i Pablo Iglesias d'encobrir Íñigo Errejón: \"Ho sabien i ho van tapar\"",
    "text": "El PP ha acusat la vicepresidenta segona del govern espanyol i líder de Sumar, Yolanda Díaz, i l'exvicepresident i líder de Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, d'encobrir Íñigo Errejón davant les acusacions de violència masclista que han propiciat la seva dimissió com a portaveu de Sumar al Congrés. La vicesecretària de Mobilització i Repte Digital del PP, Noelia Núñez, ha expressat la \"repulsa\" del seu partit en cas que aquestes acusacions siguin els \"veritables motius\" que han dut Errejón a abandonar la política. \"Sembla que era un secret a veus en tots els àmbits de l'esquerra. Ho sabien, ho van tapar i ho van consentir\", ha lamentat Núñez, que ha reclamat a Díaz que doni \"explicacions\" i que \"aparti de les seves responsabilitats\" a qualsevol altra persona que hagués col·laborat en encobrir les suposades agressions. El vicesecretari de Coordinació Autonòmica i Local del PP, Elías Bendodo, ha ampliat les acusacions a Pablo Iglesias.\nNúñez, a més, ha equiparat les acusacions existents contra Errejón amb les informacions conegudes sobre l'exministre de Transports José Manuel Ábalos en relació amb el cas Koldo. \"Aquest és el feminisme hipòcrita d'aquest govern, Pedro Sánchez amb Ábalos i ara la senyora Yolanda Díaz amb Errejón\", ha llançat la vicesecretària popular que ha assegurat que \"si l'agressor és d'esquerres es tapa perquè l'únic que interessa és el poder\". \"El govern que va començar amb un pacte de perdedors continua amb un pacte d'encobridors\", ha etzibat. D'altra banda, Núñez, en referència a la carta on Errejón ha justificat la seva sortida de la política apel·lant al desgast de la salut física, mental i emocional, ha reclamat que \"no es faci servir la salut mental\" per tapar possibles situacions de violència masclista.\n\"Consternació\" a Sumar, que dona suport a les víctimes\nLa secretària de Comunicació de Sumar, Elizabeth Duval, ha assegurat que Errejón va reconèixer \"fets moralment reprovables\" després que el partit li exigís explicacions arran de la denúncia anònima amb acusacions d'actituds masclistes publicada a les xarxes contra ell. Duval ha reconegut que a Sumar estan \"consternats\" i ha lamentat que l'exdiputat no compleix els \"estàndards d'exemplaritat feminista, que s'ha d'exigir a qualsevol càrrec polític, a qualsevol càrrec públic, però particularment a un càrrec polític d'esquerres\", segons ha defensat en declaracions a la Cadena Ser. Yolanda Díaz, que aquest dijous es trobava de viatge a Bogotà, s'ha limitat a llançar un missatge de suport a \"totes les dones que han fet una passa endavant\" per denunciar. \"No només cal donar-los suport, cal acompanyar-les en el que calgui\", ha afirmat.\nElNacional.cat a WhatsApp, hi trobaràs tota l'actualitat, en un clic!",

    "title": "Loved Ones Pay Tribute to Pregnant Texas Teen Shot Dead With Boyfriend: ‘She Was So Loving’ (Exclusive)",
    "text": "About 200 people gathered for a vigil in Texas on Thursday evening to pay tribute to Savanah Soto , the pregnant teen who was murdered along with her boyfriend shortly before Christmas. Dozens of residents, dressed in pink T-shirts featuring Soto's picture, visited Kenwood Park near downtown San Antonio for the vigil, where many exchanged hugs and tears as they remembered the 18-year-old mom-to-be. \"She was the princess of the family,\" Maria, who declined to give her last name but says she was close to the family, told The Messenger while at the vigil. \"It hurts.\" \"And, she’s the only girl in the family, so it hurts even more,\" the 30-year-old, dressed in white jeans and a pink sweater, added. Soto and her boyfriend, Matthew Guerra , were found shot dead in a Silver Kia parked near an apartment complex on Tuesday. Authorities believe their bodies may have been there for several days. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office told The Messenger that both Soto and Guerra died from gunshot wounds to the head. \"She was meant to be a mom,\" Joanie Wasil, sister-in-law to Soto, told The Messenger on Thursday. \"She was so loving with all her nieces and nephews.\" \"I want people to know that this isn’t how I’m going to remember her,\" she explained. \"I’m going to remember the caring, loving, crazy Vanah we all knew.\" Soto grew up with seven brothers, Maria said, and was \"a tomboy at heart\" and a \"beautiful young girl.\" \"Gloria raised wonderful children,\" Maria told The Messenger. \"She is an amazing mother. Her children are watching over her and her siblings.\" \"Justice means bringing everyone accountable for what acts took place,\" she continued. \"May not be today, may not be tomorrow, but in a matter of time.\" It's believed that Soto may have been preparing to head to a local hospital for an appointment before she was killed, according to her mother, Gloria Cordova. She was scheduled to be induced into labor to deliver her son, Fabian, that Saturday. While speaking about Soto, Wasil said that the vigil would have been \"exactly\" what she would have wanted. \"She’d be very, very happy so many people are showing love,\" Wasil told The Messenger. \"I know she’s happy her family is all together.\" She said Soto's mother is \"just trying to be strong for everyone\" and is \"hanging in there as much as she can for the rest of the family.\" Police are now asking for help identifying two people filmed on a surveillance camera interacting with someone inside the car that belonged to Guerra. San Antonio police shared the footage on Facebook and X on Thursday. \"It’s a step closer,\" Wasil said. \"We’re getting closer to who actually did this. We’re going to get justice for Vanah.\"",

    "text": "Arkansas HB 1150 a model for other states, federal government, organizations say\nAlexandria, Va., April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a significant victory for patients and community pharmacies in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed HB 1150 into law today. This is groundbreaking legislation that prohibits state permits to pharmacies owned by pharmacy benefit managers effective Jan. 1, 2026. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents the country's independent pharmacies, supported the Arkansas Pharmacists Association's leadership on HB 1150 as it moved through the legislative process.\nAPA is the voice of Arkansas pharmacists and has worked hard to advance HB 1150 and other PBM reform efforts. NCPA, which represents the country's independent community pharmacies, has also persistently advocated that state and federal policymakers rein in the conflicts of interest and anticompetitive business practices that arise with PBMs vertically integrated upstream with health insurers and downstream with pharmacies. These practices include contract terms that restrict competitors' access to patients, massive clawbacks, steering patients away from competing community pharmacies, below-cost reimbursements, and punitive audit practices. Prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies via HB 1150 would put an end to these tactics and promote Arkansans' access to quality pharmacy care.\n\"Today is a new day in Arkansas for our patients as the fox will no longer guard the henhouse,” said John Vinson, APA's chief executive officer. \"This bipartisan legislation passed overwhelmingly to protect public health and safety for Arkansans. HB 1150 will stop the abusive self-dealing at PBM affiliated pharmacies that raises prescription drug prices and limits patient access. The pharmacists of Arkansas are very grateful for a courageous legislature and Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. We also thank Attorney General Tim Griffin for his support.”\n\"Time and time again, PBMs have proven themselves to be resistant to transparency and reform,” said Anne Cassity, NCPA's senior vice president of government affairs. \"HB 1150 is a structural change that gets to the heart of the problem - the conflicts of interest inherent in vertical integration that PBMs have been manipulating to the detriment of patients, taxpayers, and pharmacies. We applaud HB 1150 and are eager to see its provisions implemented in Arkansas and, ideally, throughout the country.\"",
