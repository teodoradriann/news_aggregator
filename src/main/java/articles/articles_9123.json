    "text": "‘ComBank Digital’ – Sri Lanka’s most-used digital banking platform – has significantly enhanced mass access by going trilingual, promoting greater inclusivity and even higher usage.\nAnnouncing the development, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon said the platform’s multilingual capability is expected to expedite adoption of digital banking in rural areas and more traditional customer segments.\nCommercial Bank’s Assistant General Manager – Digital Banking Mr Pradeep Banduwansa also expressed the hope that with its multilingual functionality, ComBank Digital would help extend access to financial services to the un-banked and under-banked, providing them the benefits of digital transformation.\n“With 1.2 million users, ComBank Digital is already a significant element of our sustainability roadmap, but there are still demographic as well as geographic gaps in terms of usage, which we are addressing by providing users the option to choose to perform transactions in Sinhala or Tamil,” Mr Banduwansa said. “This will make usage easier for some customer segments and encourage larger numbers to register on the platform.”\nHe said the launch of the Sinhala and Tamil platforms can also be considered an early gift in anticipation of the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year.\nThe Bank has also announced that ComBank Digital will offer an additional 1% on the interest rates applicable to 300-Day and One Year Fixed Deposits (Interest at maturity) opened on 14th and 15th April via the platform. Additionally, new users who successfully register on 14th April 2024, will receive a cash reward of Rs 250/- solely for their registration, the Bank said.\nAn integration of all online and mobile banking channels on a single omni-channel platform, ComBank Digital is offered via a responsive web application and three native mobile applications (iOS, Android and Huawei), enabling access across all devices such as desktop PCs, laptop computers, tabs and smart phones.\n ",

    "text": "Read Previous Post\nWaverly Students Reach for the Stars in Balloon Drop Challenge\nGalactic Night Owls and Gold Mind classes at The Waverly School furthered their astronomy studies by participating in one of the year’s most exciting events. Students worked in teams to design and construct “space vehicles” capable of safely transporting a water balloon when dropped from the Elementary School balcony. The challenge encouraged collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving as students aimed to protect their balloon during the descent. Reflecting on the experience, one student shared, “The balloon drop was a fun opportunity to make friends and socialize with people you had never talked to before.”\nThe Waverly School, 67 W. Bellevue Drive, Pasadena, (626) 792-5940 or visit thewaverlyschool.org.",
