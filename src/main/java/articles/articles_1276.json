    "title": "Hamas considering latest Gaza truce offer in 'positive spirit' - Breitbart",
    "text": "Hamas says it is considering in a “positive spirit” a Gaza truce deal, while the UN warned rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory would require efforts not seen since World War II. After months of stop-start negotiations, Hamas has sounded an optimistic tone about the latest hostages-for-ceasefire proposal, raising hopes an agreement may soon be reached — even as medics in the besieged strip reported fresh strikes on Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah on Friday. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group will “soon” send a delegation to Egypt to complete ongoing ceasefire discussions with a deal that “realises the demands of our people”. Haniyeh, the leader of the militant group’s political wing, told Egyptian and Qatari mediators in calls on Thursday that Hamas was studying the latest proposal from Israel with a “positive spirit”. The stakes of the truce talks were thrown into sharp relief Thursday, when a UN report estimated it could take 80 years to reconstruct all the homes flattened over the course of the nearly seven-month war. “The scale of the destruction is huge and unprecedented… this is a mission that the global community has not dealt with since World War II,” Abdallah al-Dardari, the UNDP’s Regional Director for Arab States told a briefing in Jordan. The UNDP assessment forecast the socioeconomic toll inflicted will cost generations of Palestinians to come and called for an urgent ceasefire. ‘Suffering’ The only truce mediators have been able to hammer out so far was a week-long deal in November, that saw the release of 105 hostages for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Israel estimates that 129 captives seized by the militants during their October 7 attack remain in Gaza. The military says 35 of them are dead, including 49-year-old Dror Or. The government confirmed Or’s death early Friday. Two of his children were among the hostages released during the November truce. Hamas and Israel have been at loggerheads for months over the terms of any new deal. The militant group has demanded a permanent ceasefire to end the war and the withdrawal of troops, which Israel has refused. While Israel faces regular protests demanding the government bring home remaining captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight on. With or without a truce, he has said he will send ground troops into Rafah, despite global concerns over the fate of around 1.5 million civilians sheltering there. The truce offer under consideration includes a 40-day halt to fighting and the exchange of Israeli hostages for potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain. During his latest whirlwind visit to the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the Palestinian group to accept what he termed an “extraordinarily generous” deal on the part of Israel. “If Hamas actually purports to care about the Palestinian people and wants to see an immediate alleviation of their suffering, it will take the deal,” Blinken told reporters Wednesday. Until Haniyeh’s comments, Gaza-rulers Hamas had indicated a generally negative reception of the proposed truce. The war started with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. UNDP estimated that as of April 12, at least five percent of Gaza’s population had been killed or injured. “The suffering in Gaza will not end when the war does,” UNDP chief Achim Steiner said. “Unprecedented levels of human losses, capital destruction, and the steep rise in poverty in such a short period of time will precipitate a serious development crisis,” he added. ‘Mouths left hungry’ The humanitarian crisis and rising death toll in Gaza have prompted demonstrations around the world, including in universities in the United States, Canada and France. Israeli President Isaac Herzog slammed the protests, charging that the US universities had been “contaminated by hatred and anti-Semitism”. Colombia severed diplomatic ties with Israel on Wednesday, while Turkey on Thursday announced it was suspending trade. Gaza’s 2.4 million inhabitants are threatened by famine, but international aid has only been able to trickle in. Under US pressure, Israel has allowed increased aid deliveries in recent days, including through a reopened border crossing. At south Gaza’s largest hospital, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis, which was heavily damaged by fighting in February, foreign aid and borrowed equipment has helped to “almost completely” restore the emergency department, its director Atef al-Hout said. US charity World Central Kitchen resumed delivering food to starving Gazans this week, after it had suspended operations following an Israeli strike in April that killed seven of its staffers. “We realised after the kitchen closed that many mouths were left hungry,” kitchen manager Zakria Yahya Abukuwaik said, while preparing food in Rafah. burs-lb/pjm",

    "text": "More Than 15,000 WhatsApp Accounts of These Users Blocked By Indian Govt: Here's Why\nWhatsApp is being used by scammers and hackers to steal valuable data and money from their victims.\nThe Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) and Department of Telecommunication (DoT) have blocked at least 17,000 WhatsApp accounts used by cyber criminals from South East Asia, it was announced on Thursday.\nIn a post on X social media platform, CyberDost, a cyber-safety handle maintained by the Ministry of Home Affairs, informed that it aims to disrupt offshore criminal networks and strengthen India’s digital security.\n“I4C, in collaboration with DoT, has successfully blocked 17,000 WhatsApp accounts used by cyber criminals from South East Asia. The initiative aims to disrupt offshore criminal networks and strengthen India’s #DigitalSecurity,\" CyberDost posted.\nIn May this year, the Ministry of Home Affairs set up an inter-ministerial committee in reaction to a big rise in transnational organised cybercrime coming from Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos-Philippines.\nAbout 45 per cent of cyber-financial frauds in India come from places in Southeast Asia. These crimes have become more complicated and bigger, which costs the victims a lot of money.\nThe I4C has taken many steps to damage the infrastructure that hackers use.\nIts investigation showed that cybercriminals trick people into giving them money by offering investment chances, games, dating apps, and fake trading platforms.\nNotably, Indian teens and young adults have been tricked into going to Cambodia to find work, only to be forced to commit cybercrimes there.\nIndian citizens who were protesting in a Cambodian city were arrested, and steps were taken to send them back home and keep them safe.\nI4C focuses on tackling all the issues related to cybercrime for the citizens, which includes improving coordination between various Law Enforcement Agencies and the stakeholders, driving change in India’s overall capability to tackle Cybercrime and to improve citizen satisfaction levels.\nThe Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre scheme was approved on October 5, 2018.\nSince its roll out, it has worked towards enhancing the nation’s collective capability to tackle cybercrimes and develop effective coordination among the law enforcement agencies.\n(This story has not been edited by News18 staff and is published from a syndicated news agency feed -[IANS](https://www.news18.com/agency/ians.html))\n- Location :\n- First Published:",

    "text": "Photo: Kabir Jhangiani/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n– Kabir Jhangiani/Zuma Press Wire/ Dpa\nMADRID, 11 Mar. (EUROPA PRESS) –\nThe Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, called this Monday for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, where more than 31,100 people have died due to Israel’s offensive against the Palestinian enclave, during the month of Ramadan.\n“My strongest call today is to honor the spirit of Ramadan in order to silence the guns and remove all obstacles to ensure the delivery of vital aid at the speed and scale required,” he said in statements to the press.\nIn this sense, he explained that in Ramadan the Muslim community “celebrates and spreads the values ​​of peace, reconciliation and solidarity.” “Yet even though Ramadan has begun, the killings, bombings and bloodshed continue in Gaza,” he argued.\nLikewise, Guterres has appealed to the “spirit of compassion” in this sacred month, recalling the “immediate” need to release all hostages held by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Palestinian enclave.\n“I call on political, religious and community leaders around the world to do everything in their power to make this sacred period a time of empathy, action and peace,” he stressed.\nFinally, the UN Secretary General has reiterated that a possible incursion by the Israeli Army in Rafah “could plunge the people of Gaza into an even deeper circle of hell.” “We must act to avoid more deaths,” he concluded.\nIsrael launched its offensive against Hamas after the October 7 attacks, which left around 1,200 dead and some 240 kidnapped. Gazan authorities have put the death toll in the Palestinian enclave at more than 31,100.\nPost Views: 1.267\n#António #Guterres #calls #ceasefire #Gaza #month #Ramadan\n– 2024-05-05 06:20:51",

    "text": "Sergio Mattarella discursou em reunião sobre Agenda 2030 O presidente da Itália, Sergio Mattarella, renovou seu apelo pelo fim dos conflitos mundiais nesta segunda-feira (6), afirmando que \"a paz e o desenvolvimento sustentável têm destinos cruzados\". A declaração foi dada em uma reunião de alto nível sobre paz, justiça e inclusão social para o desenvolvimento sustentável, no âmbito do Objetivo de Desenvolvimento Sustentável 16 da Agenda 2030 da Organização das Nações Unidas. \"A Agenda tem o mérito de ter fornecido um horizonte concreto para suas realizações, indicando um caminho que todos os Estados-membros se esforçaram para buscar no interesse dos povos, passando sobretudo pela preservação do planeta, o local que habitam\", disse o presidente, em Nova York. \"A paz e o desenvolvimento têm destinos cruzados. Não pode haver uma sem o outro. Vivemos em uma época com o maior número de conflitos desde o fim da Segunda Guerra Mundial, que devoram enormes recursos na corrida armamentista, subtraindo-os do desenvolvimento. A apelo à construção das condições necessárias para a paz e para pôr fim aos conflitos não poderia ser mais necessário e urgente\", prosseguiu. Mattarella ainda fez um alerta sobre os fenômenos de desinformação: \"Enfrentamos hoje um perigo maior que mina a relação de confiança com as instituições e entre as países, o da desinformação. Na última sexta-feira [3] tivemos o Dia Mundial da Liberdade de Imprensa, que avisa, a cada ano, sobre o valor da liberdade de informação para a manutenção da democracia\". \"É com base nessa abordagem que a Itália emprega suas ações, com firme determinação ao apoiar os instrumentos de diálogo baseados no princípio do multilateralismo que hoje vemos tão dramaticamente colocados em discussão na agressão russa à Ucrânia e pelas consequências do conflito entre Israel e Palestina\", afirmou o chefe de Estado italiano. .",
