    "title": "The BOM predicted a hot dry summer right before the flooding rains came…",
    "text": "By Jo Nova\nAustralians are angry the BOM didn’t see the flooding rains coming\nWorse, we’re betting the nation on the BOM’s ability to predict the climate.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) tells Australians that record breaking extremes are getting worse because of our cars and our air-conditioners (that’s “\nThe State of the Climate“). But when the BOM can’t predict record breaking rain a month in advance, or even the day before, we know the BOM doesn’t understand what drives the climate.\nSomehow the BOM expect Australians to spend trillions and rearrange their economy based on their fifty year prophesies, but not to mind when “this summer” goes right off the rails.\nBack in September the BOM issued its El Nino alert, and Australians were told it would be a\n hot and dry and to prepare for a summer of bushfires. Farmer sold their lambs, and adjusted harvest accordingly.\nThis was the BOM solemn prediction in late October, for the very next month of rainfall\nAcross most of Australia the\nodds were only 20-40% of getting average rain.\nInstead this is what happened:\nAnd in December most of the country was predicted to have a fifty fifty chance of getting “average” rain.\nBut the real weather gods had another idea, and all the places under any shades of green below got somewhere from 100% to 300% of the average rainfall. The indigo and purple zones got even more.\nThis was a savage downpour — seven feet of rain in five days fell at one location:\nNo fewer than 12 locations across far north Queensland posted record rainfall totals.\nSome areas received a year’s rainfall in a single day, isolating towns, closing highways and leaving hundreds stranded by surging floodwaters. Black Mountain near Cooktown recorded a cumulative 2189mm over the five days, while Mossman South, an hour northwest of Cairns, had 1935mm.\nAs the Mayor of Douglas Shire said:\n“If this is so record-breaking, how did no one know this was going to happen … we need to have forecasts closer to what is going on.”\nThe BOM suddenly wants to absolve itself of liability\nPeople have noticed there is now a mandatory check box forcing users to agree to a legal disclaimer clearing the BOM of all liability:\nUsers of the BOM app now have to agree to a 699-word “terms and conditions” statement that includes “information at this app … may not be accurate, current or complete”.\n“To the maximum extent permitted by law, the bureau excludes any liability that may arise in connection with the BOM Weather app or any information or material presented therein or your access to or use of any of the same,’’ the bureau says in a “terms and conditions” statement that appears when a user attempts to download its app. —\nMackenzie Scott, The Australian\nThey know they are in trouble.\nI say the BOM can have immunity the same day Australians can also tick a box excluding ourselves from any and all costs, imposts and taxes related to any BOM predictions.\nThe Australian editors gives the BOM an escape valve it doesn’t deserve:\nTo be fair to the BOM, a hysterical and ill-informed media has allowed climate alarmism to infect reporting of what should be routine weather events.\nFor thirty years the Australian media has made hyperbolic scare stories about the weather while the BOM tacitly stood by and smiled. Where were they as the tenets of science were trashed, and critics were called “climate deniers”? If the BOM are victims of this hyperbole now, they reap what they sowed.\nThe BOM raised the stakes, and they don’t get to weasel out by saying\n“we used the best science” as if the best science wasn’t riddled with holes. If the science is good enough to throw away trillions of dollars, then the worst failures need a truckload of explanation.\nPredicting the weather is hard. We could forgive the BOM for getting a complex immature science wrong, but not when they also tell us it’s just simple physics, they’re absolutely sure, and there is no doubt they’re wrong (give us your money!).",

    "text": "Cancel your weekend plans and beeline for Taronga Zoo – the harbourside zoo has just welcomed a four-week-old female pygmy hippopotamus into the open air, and we can’t quite get over the pictures of her and her mum hanging out in the pool.\nThe Taronga team made the announcement yesterday, February 15 – in line with World Hippo Day (yes, there really is a day for everything). The baby calf has been born to Australasia’s only breeding pair, Kambiri and Fergus, and has been named by the Taronga team as ‘Lololi’ (pronounced Lol-ol-i), a West African name meaning ‘there is always love’.\nBorn exactly a month ago today (on January 16, 2024) and weighing only 4kg, Lololi has been bonding with her mum Kambiri at Taronga’s behind-the-scenes nursery, and only now will visitors to the zoo get the chance to glimpse her in the open air. The images we've seen of the mum and daughter splashing in the shallows are a little too cute to handle.\n“Kambiri and the calf have been hitting all milestones we hope to observe - suckling, swimming, and growing daily,” explains Senior Ungulate Keeper Renae Moss.\nPhotograph: Supplied | Taronga Zoo As with many of the animals cared for at Taronga, Pygmy Hippos are listed as endangered – with an estimated population of less than 2,500 remaining in the wild due to logging, mining and agriculture destroying their natural habitat. Native to West Africa, The Taronga Conservation Society is home to the only breeding pair of pygmy hippos in Australasia, and now their family is a family of three.\nIf you’re keen to catch baby Lololi, your best bet is to visit Taronga in the morning – as pygmy hippos are generally nocturnal. So head over early, then spend the rest of the day exploring Sydney’s leafy north. Want to make a day of it? Find out what's happening at Twilight at Taronga .\nRECOMMENDED: This incredibly rare turtle has laid her eggs on the NSW coast Visitors to this national park near Sydney are reporting regular platypus sightings These natural wonders are just a short drive away from Sydney Winnie Stubbs Lifestyle Writer",

    "text": "Friday starts with wintry mix, poor road conditions to start a weekend of winter weather The National Weather Service Des Moines is warning that two rounds of winter weather, complete with mixed rain, snow, thunderstorm and ice events, will hit central Iowa starting Friday and continuing into next week. Rain, snow and thunderstorms caused slick roads and very low visibilities during Friday morning’s commute, the [NWS said](https://www.weather.gov/media/dmx/DssPacket.pdf). Flurries started falling in downtown Des Moines around 8:30 Friday morning. Northern Iowa can expect snow, including periods of heavy and wet snow. In central Iowa, rain, wintry mix and heavy and wet snow are expected. Southern Iowa will receive rain and a wintry mix. What weather can Iowa expect Friday? North and northeast Iowa will see the most snowfall on Friday, with 2 to 4 inches possible. NWS meteorologists said impactful snowfall is likely across portions of Iowa from Highway 20 south to Interstate 80 as rain turns to snow and wintry mix. More: [Did you hear thunder? Thundersnow is real. Let us explain.](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/weather/2024/03/22/what-is-thundersnow-winter-snowstorm-thunder-lightning-iowa-national-weather-service/73065069007/) Central Iowa can expect the wintry mix to continue through 9 a.m. Friday, and eastern Iowa until 11 a.m. Conditions in Des Moines on Friday will be snowy, rainy and breezy. The high is expected to be 40 degrees, with a low of 26 degrees overnight. The total daytime and sleet accumulation is expected to be around an inch. How can I check Iowa road conditions? Be prepared and check road conditions before you head out. NWS warned online that there's an increasing number of accidents Friday morning. You can check road conditions any time online with the Iowa Department of Transportation's interactive map at [511ia.org](http://www.511ia.org/) or by dialing 511. The National Weather Service expects very low visibility on the roads to continue through the weekend and offered tips for drivers: - Clean off your vehicle before driving, flying snow from cars can cause accidents. - Keep it slow, and don't use cruise control. The roads can be slick even if they only look wet. - Leave extra distance between vehicles, and stay especially far away from snow plows. What will Des Moines' weather look like over the weekend? Saturday, there is a slight chance of rain and snow in Des Moines after 5 p.m., with a high of 39 degrees during the day. Snow showers are expected into the night, with a low of 31 degrees. On Sunday, rain and snow showers are possible before 7 p.m., with a high of 46 degrees. Into the night, there's a 90% chance of rain with snowfall up to an inch possible.
