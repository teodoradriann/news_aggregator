    "title": "Ja Morant slammed by former NBA player Chandler Parsons over controversial 'gun celebration' against New Orleans Pelicans | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Former NBA player Chandler Parsons was critical of Ja Morant's controversial celebration after hitting an alley-oop against the New Orleans Pelicans. Morant was playing in only his fourth game back after returning from a 25-game suspension and 'It's ridiculous,' Parsons said on FanDuel TV's 'Run It Back' show. 'You gotta grow up. Why are we talking about this? Your team is 4-0 [since Morant's return.] You've been unbelievable.' 'You've now been probably forgiven to a certain point, especially in Memphis, right? The team is back to being yours. You're playing at an elite level. Why are you giving us anything like this to even talk about, to discuss, that's negative?' 'Why is your father [Tee Morant] doing interviews talking about how you didn't make any changes in your personal life and your issues, sitting courtside with his hood and glasses on.' Ex-NBA player Chandler Parsons was critical of Ja Morant's celebration against the Pelicans Morant performed the controversial celebration after hitting an alley-oop against New Orleans Many X users including Morant have noted the celebration to be a dance from New Orleans Ja Morant pulled out that BR cell https://t.co/IF5379EDg9 pic.twitter.com/25Kdw6u8hE LSU's football team has been seen doing the dance multiple times after scoring touchdowns Many social media users - including Morant - have noted that 24-year-old's celebration that Parsons and other critics have incorrectly tried to brand as a gun celebration was in fact a popular dance from New Orleans, that was being performed against a New Orleans team. LSU's football team - most notably potential first-round NFL draft pick Malik Nabers - has gone viral on multiple occasions for doing the dance to celebrate touchdowns. 'What else has to happen for you and your family and your friends to learn? Just make this about basketball, make this about your life, make this about your livelihood, and stop doing things like this because you're must-see TV on the court, Parsons continued. 'Aside from Anthony Edwards, you are my favorite player to watch. Don't give us any of this other bull***t to talk about. Just be a star.' Since returning from his suspension, Morant has played like a star with an average of 28.8 points and 8.5 assists in his four games this season. Parsons has not played in the NBA since the 2019-20 when he appeared in only five games for the Houston Rockets. During those five appearances he played in less than 11 minutes per game and averaged only 2.8 points per game.",

    "text": "Yudhra trailer: Netizens feel Siddhant Chaturvedi was miscast, re-iterate Raghav Juyal was ‘born to be a villain’ As the Yudhra trailer dropped yesterday, fans are abuzz with anticipation to see Siddhant’s acting prowess and Raghav's latest anti-hero role Siddhant Chaturvedi is having a stellar year, and now anticipation is building for his next venture Yudhra, directed by Ravi Udyawar. The trailer which dropped yesterday has already garnered significant attention. Produced by Farhan Akhtar under Excel Entertainment, the film also stars Malavika Mohanan, Gajraj Rao, Ram Kapoor, Raj Arjun, Raghav Juyal, and Shilpa Shukla. Yudhra is set to hit theatres on September 20 of this year. The trailer opens with Siddhant’s character Yudhra, narrating a story from his deathbed. While there are subtle allusions to the Mahabharata, the film primarily revolves around a violent, anger-driven protagonist who wreaks havoc because he can’t or doesn't want to control his murderous rage. As the trailer unfolds, it hints at parallels between Yudhra's dark past and his father's, both plagued by similar anger issues. However, Yudhra attempts to channel his fury for a greater cause — taking down a powerful drug mafia. The makers have also unveiled Raghav Juyal as the main villain Shafiq, which is his next role right after his anti-hero debut in Kill, a performance that got fans dubbing him “villain of the year”. Supporters seem super excited about watching yet another dimension of his evil roles on the big screen saying, “Raghav is now the face of villain in every movie ” Others shared this sentiment. Others are excited to see Siddhant in such a different role, something that most netizens thought would be out of his comfort zone. There were also a few comments about the writing of his character with one fan saying, “Whoever wrote the dialogues for this movie. Humble request , write dialogues for every Hindi action movies from now on. It fits really well , I cannot believe they managed to make Siddhant Chaturvedi a badass!!!” But like all art, there is some scepticism from the audience. Many feel like the movie is too violent, while others think Siddhant was gloriously miscast. “This could have been something if they had opted for a different actor,” said a user on Reddit. There was also discourse around the dialogues feeling dubbed, “Yet another proper talent webbed into the mass action movies about a character who fights and is angry all the time appeal to the larger audience, when he doesn't have the aura to pull it off. Sigh,\" said another. While the trailer has sparked both excitement and scepticism, it’s clear that Yudhra will be a film that leaves a lasting impression!",
