    "text": "Summer Experience: Cody Losey ’26L\nMeet Siju Oshin ’26L: Legal Fellow with the International Refugee Assistance Project This semester, Siju Oshin is working in an independent research position with a global legal aid and advocacy organization.\nSiju Oshin ‘26L is from Laurel, MD. She graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2020 with a degree in psychology and a minor in sociology. Before coming to law school, she worked at local non-profits in Maryland dedicated to locating affordable housing and providing legal representation/resources for tenants in court. Last summer, she was a legal intern with the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project in Washington, D.C. This spring she will be a legal intern with Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics, and this summer, she will be a summer associate with Swift, Currie, McGhee, and Hiers LLP in their Atlanta, GA office. Currently, Siju is engaged in an independent research position with the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), a global legal aid and advocacy organization.\nDescribe your work with IRAP.\nMost of my research and work has been focused on a specific case for a client that is in the process of applying for a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) after working overseas on behalf of the U.S. government. Most recently I have been working on drafting a declaration to appeal their denial of the SIV, which has involved conducting client interviews, gathering research regarding different subcontracts and their connection to the U.S. government, as well as reviewing client documents such as employment records, letters of recommendation, and other personal documents. This is to ensure that the information included in their declaration is accurate, while also making sure that we are addressing and resolving issues that may have led to their initial denial.\nHow did you get this position?\nGoogle! I knew coming into 2L year that I wanted to do an internship at a non-profit during the school year, so I used Google to see if I could find any organizations that were looking for law students. I came across IRAP and was immediately drawn to the work they do regarding immigration and refugee rights, especially because I am a first-generation American. I submitted my application, interviewed a few weeks later, and was offered the position a few weeks after that!\nWhat has been your greatest takeaway as a legal fellow?\nI think doing this work has really emphasized the importance of the non-profit legal sector. Coming into this internship I knew that immigration work was complex, but after engaging with this work, I’ve gotten to see how intricate it really is and to witness firsthand the impact it has on clients. At times the work can be emotionally taxing, but providing meaningful assistance to people definitely makes it worth it.\nIs there a way for fellow law students or prospective law students to get involved?\nFor IRAP specifically, applications for fellows for the 2025-2026 school year will open in the summer, and this opportunity is open to both 2Ls and 3Ls. More generally, I would encourage law students to be willing to take more initiative. The Office of Career Strategy is wonderful, but if you have specific interests that you would like to explore that they may not have information about, don’t be afraid to branch out and look for opportunities on your own! Also, utilize the alumni network. In my experience, they’re always willing to make time to speak with current students.",

    "title": "Synergy and Munich Re Partner to Restore Long Beach Wetlands: A Major Step Towards Environmental Conservation",
    "text": "In a groundbreaking move that signifies a major leap towards environmental conservation, Synergy, a Long Beach-based oil and gas company, has joined forces with Munich Re, a leading global reinsurance firm, to embark on a monumental project aimed at restoring coastal wetlands in Long Beach, California. Announced on February 16, 2024, this initiative not only marks a pivotal moment for Synergy in its commitment to environmental stewardship but also sets a precedent for sustainable development within the region. The project, sprawled across a 140-acre site, endeavors to rejuvenate the Los Cerritos wetlands through the restoration of native habitats and the plugging and abandoning of legacy wells, thereby culminating in the creation of a permanent wetlands conservation site.\nReviving the Heart of Long Beach\nThe collaboration between Synergy and Munich Re is not just a business venture; it is a testament to the power of synergy in fostering environmental rejuvenation. By securing the necessary financing, Synergy is poised to address the long-standing issue of legacy wells while simultaneously breathing new life into 156 acres of coastal wetlands. This ambitious project aims to transform the landscape, turning a once-degraded area into a thriving habitat for biodiversity and a green lung for the communities of Long Beach and Seal Beach. The initiative underscores a shared vision for a future where economic development and environmental conservation go hand in hand, providing a blueprint for similar endeavors worldwide.\nThe Science of Restoration\nParallel to the efforts in Long Beach, research spearheaded by The Nature Conservancy Aotearoa New Zealand is shedding light on how coastal ecosystems like salt marshes and mangroves can shield the Bay of Plenty's coastline from the adverse effects of climate change. This project, centered around the Waihī Estuary, is not only about ecological restoration but also about pioneering the concept of resilience credits. Funded by BayTrust, the initiative seeks to quantify the role of wetlands in mitigating flooding and storm surges, thereby enhancing ecological health and biodiversity. This research is a critical step towards understanding the multifaceted benefits of wetlands, from blue carbon storage to natural defense mechanisms against climate change.\nA Rising Tide: The Challenge Ahead\nAs coastal communities worldwide grapple with the realities of rapid sea level rise, the plight of Louisiana's coastal wetlands offers a stark reminder of what is at stake. A study focusing on the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana's coastal landscapes has highlighted the daunting challenges these ecosystems face in keeping pace with rising water levels. With projections indicating the potential drowning of 75% of Louisiana's coastal wetlands by 2070 under current climate trajectories, the urgency for action has never been clearer. This scenario underscores the imperative need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, ensuring their survival and the protection of the communities that depend on them.\nIn conclusion, the partnership between Synergy and Munich Re to restore coastal wetlands in Long Beach represents a significant stride towards reconciling human activity with nature's needs. The project not only aims to rectify the environmental degradation of the past but also sets a forward-thinking example for sustainable development. By leveraging scientific research and innovative financing mechanisms, such initiatives offer hope for a resilient future, where the beauty and biodiversity of coastal ecosystems are preserved for generations to come. As the world faces increasing environmental challenges, the story of Long Beach's wetlands restoration serves as a beacon of what can be achieved when collaboration, science, and commitment converge towards a common goal.",

    "text": "High temperatures across several New England cities, including Boston and Worcester, broke records on Friday.\nBoston hit a high of 79 degrees, surpassing the 1974 record of 77 degrees on Nov. 1, according to the National Weather Service.\nTo the west, Worcester reached 76 degrees, breaking its 2003 record of 73 degrees.\nHartford was just a little warmer than Boston, hitting a high of 84 degrees. The last record high was on Nov. 1, 1974, at 81 degrees.\nProvidence tied with its record high in the same year at 78 degrees.\nThese records come amidst a Red Flag Warning set to last until 7 p.m. Days of wind, very little moisture and drought conditions have fueled several wildfires across parts of the state, including in Salem, Lynn, Wilmington, Middleton and Canton.\nIn October, at least 200 wildfires were reported, with almost half of them reported in the last week, Fire Marshal Jon Davine’s office said in a statement released on Friday. The October average of 15 fires jumped by 1,200% last month.\n“They accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres burned so far this year,” Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation said in Davine’s statement. “The weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead. Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.”\nThe warm weather is not expected to stay for long, as temperatures are expected to drop starting Saturday with highs in the 50s, forecasters said.",

    "text": "Outdoor TV antenna making strong comeback - US Households Cut the Cord: OTA Antennas and Streaming Redefine TV Entertainment 02-27-2025 11:06 PM CET | Associations & Organizations\nPress release from: ABNewswire\nThe Resurgence of OTA Antennas in U.S. Households\nThe household entertainment landscape is shifting for US families. After three decades of cable and satellite subscriptions dominating the market, households are transitioning back to Over-the-Air (OTA) antenna ( https://www.usawireless.tv/antennateam ) programming in combination with streaming services for cost-effective and customized experience.\nOffering local sports, news and major network broadcasts, OTA was once the primary way households received television entertainment with OTA antennas installed in over 90% of households during the 70s and 80s. With the rise of cable and satellite TV, many households have transitioned over for more programming and higher quality. However this trend is changing as households are cutting their cords for OTA and streaming. With the Federal Communications Commission mandating broadcasting transition from analog to digital, improvements in OTA technology and high costs of cable subscriptions, many households are switching back to OTA antennas to save money while still enjoying their favorite shows. According to the 2023 Horowitz Research's 'State of Media' study ( https://www.horowitzresearch.com/syndicated-research/state-of-media-disruption-and-change/ ), households with digital television antennas have increased from 14% to 18% and are expected to increase further. In addition, the research has noted that 58% of antenna owners also want news and information specific to their community.\nThe Cost-Saving Advantage of OTA TV\nOne of the most compelling reasons for the resurgence of OTA antennas is cost savings. As costs of living are on the rise in the US, many families are re-evaluating whether they need all the channels offered by cable. While OTA antennas only provide local programming, households wanting any specific programming can pick and choose streaming from popular services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.\nCompared to a cable subscription which locks them in with more channels and programming than they can realistically consume, households are able to cut their monthly costs significantly and recoup the costs of installations within a few months to a year through savings.\nThe Role of Linear Programming\nAs on-demand streaming makes up the bulk of TV consumption, millions of households still tune in to linear programming including news, sports and major events. In Nielsen's 2023 study, a little under 50% of US household TV consumption is linear TV ( https://www.warc.com/content/feed/us-linear-tv-falls- beneath-50-of-tv-time/en-GB/8535). [ https://www.warc.com/content/feed/us-linear-tv-falls-beneath-50-of-tv-time/en-GB/8535 )]\nThe full picture on linear TV is limited as data collected is much more sophisticated compared to digital and streaming. This makes OTA stats potentially underrepresented in industry studies making the true appeal potentially much higher in the shifting household media consumption landscape.\nInstallation and Usage\nThe process for setting up an OTA antenna is relatively simple and fast. For urban inner-city households, an indoor antenna can be mounted indoors on walls or windows and might suffice, giving them a connection to a broadcast tower within 1-5 miles. However, those living in areas a bit further from transmission sources and for those desiring a much higher quality of video reception should turn their focus toward a high-quality outdoor antenna with installation done by professionals. The Antenna Team at USA Wireless ( https://www.usawireless.tv/antennateam ), with over 30 years experience installing\nresidential TV systems, can help households add free OTA channels to their program viewing options. For a one-time cost to have the pros at AntennaTeam.com come to your home and install a brand-new high-quality outdoor antenna, you add thousands of free shows, sports, news, movies and more round the clock, day and night every day of the year for years to come.\nConclusion\nOTA antennas are making a comeback in US households and it is fueled by a growing desire for cost- effective, high-quality entertainment options. As cable costs continue to rise, households are starting to re-evaluate whether they need all the channels offered by cable and are turning to OTA for local pr ogramming supplemented with on-demand streaming at a fraction of the cable subscription costs. If you're considering cutting the cord, speak to an expert ( https://www.usawireless.tv/antennateam/ ) to see what local programming is available and which OTA option is ideal for you!\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: USAwireless/Antenna team\nContact Person: Ian Thompson\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=outdoor-tv-antenna-making-strong-comeback-us-households-cut-the-cord-ota-antennas-and-streaming-redefine-tv-entertainment ]\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.usawireless.tv/\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
