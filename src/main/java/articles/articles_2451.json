    "text": "The ending of Game of Thrones Season 8 will always remain in our memories as one of the most disappointing conclusions in the history of television. For eight years, fans have been rooting for the most deserving character to lead Westeros, only for someone like Bran Stark to end up becoming the ruler.\nCredits: Isaac Hempstead-Wright in Game of Thrones / HBO In fact, even the actor himself didn’t believe the showrunners would do such a thing for a project they have dedicated almost a decade of their lives. He knew the audience would get dismayed – even mad – but he still believes it to be a fitting end.\nEven Isaac Hempstead-Wright Couldn’t Believe Bran Stark Would Be King Perhaps the final season of HBO’s Game of Thrones was the most criticized of all the installments as not only the ending was anticlimactic, but it also had several production slip-ups that were beyond excuse. Apart from the fact that Emilia Clarke ’s Daenerys Targaryen would die in the hands of Kit Harington ’s Jon Snow, the next infuriating event would be the election of Isaac Hempstead-Wright ’s Bran Stark as king of Westeros.\nRELATED “We can get 7 more shows but we can’t redo season 8”: George R.R. Martin Makes a Game of Thrones Announcement That Will Piss Off Any Fan This surprised the viewers in a not-so-good way because Bran doesn’t seem like the type of character who would lead a kingdom or rule his people. He was incapacitated after falling off a tower, and spent most of his life stuck in a wheelchair.\nCredits: Isaac Hempstead-Wright in Game of Thrones / HBO After learning that his character would eventually become the fateful king, Hempstead-Wright believed it was a jest from the showrunners. He told Entertainment Weekly how he thought “ it was a joke script and that [showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss] sent to everyone a script with their own character ends up on the Iron Throne .”\nWell, this sounds like a good prank, though, and when you think about it, it’s a good way to protect the show from spoilers and online leaks as they will have different endings.\nRELATED “You’re not following my template”: George R.R. Martin’s Worst Fears About Game of Thrones Series Came True After He Predicted a Major Flaw in the Approach The decision to elect Bran as King of Westeros made a lot of fans unhappy and the 25-year-old actor is very much aware of this. A fan remarked on this about the British star and Bran’s journey in the show:\nhe understood bran spent most of his storyline in a cave. he was a cave dweller. should’ve been the master of whispers in all honesty, he’d have ALL the tea…\n— finn🐮🇵🇸 (@olrazzdazz_) August 29, 2024 It’s safe to say that fans thought he would have a more significant role in the final season as a warg and a greenseer, but it was clear that the showrunners had a different plan.\nGeorge R.R. Martin Wanted Bran Stark To Win The Game Of Thrones Credits: George R.R. Martin via CBS News Hempstead-Wright revealed that author George R.R. Martin intended Bran Stark to become king. Since the shocking news about his character, the actor didn’t believe the showrunners until he was told it was Martin’s vision all along.\nIn HBO’s Making Game of Thrones , the actor shared that “ there were two things [author] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king .” He was still happy to play the part despite the initial skepticism.\nGame of Thrones is currently streaming on HBO.",

    "text": "Las autoridades de salud en Matamoros ya están encendiendo los focos rojos ante el riesgo de que aparezcan más casos de dengue hemorrágico, especialmente tras las lluvias recientes. Según lo confirmó el secretario de Salud Municipal, Antonio Alfaro Caballero, hay un paciente bajo observación en el IMSS por posible dengue grave, con síntomas que podrían derivar en complicaciones hemorrágicas . Aunque hasta ahora solo hay un caso de dengue grave confirmado en lo que va del año —registrado en la semana epidemiológica número 23— el paciente ya se encuentra fuera de peligro.\n“Estamos esperando ahorita, pasando estas aguas, reunirnos con el personal de la Tercera Jurisdicción Sanitaria para platicar y ver qué podemos hacer precisamente para poder contener un poquito los casos probables que puedan venir”.\nActualmente, se tienen 27 casos confirmados, y la preocupación crece por este nuevo posible caso con signos de dengue hemorrágico en Matamoros.\n“Quiero comentarles que aunque no se tenga la confirmación de ese caso, obviamente al paciente se le maneja como tal, se le trata y pues esperemos que pueda estar fuera de peligro en pocos días”.\nEl problema es que los contagios no se concentran en una sola zona. Según lo discutido con el área de epidemiología, hay varios puntos de la ciudad con reportes activos . La idea es que en los próximos días se sienten a revisar los planes y ajustar lo que sea necesario para frenar los contagios antes de que escale.\n“Nosotros lo que hemos estado haciendo es precisamente en estas labores de prevención y promoción a la salud, en las áreas donde hay más densidad poblacional, por ejemplo llevamos en toda el área de Las Brisas, más de una semana en el tema de eliminación de criaderos, de descacharrización, ahorita estamos todavía en la colonia Acuario”.\nPor Jorge Capetillo",

    "text": "CLAREMORE, OKLA. (KTUL) — A new organization is helping Claremore residents in the wake of the tornado that struck their town three weeks ago. It's called the Claremore and Rogers County disaster assistance. When NewsChannel 8 arrived at the interview, there was an older gentleman outside putting the pieces of his home back together with a sling on. This organization explained its process to him and assisted him without any hesitation. The same thing they are doing for the City of Claremore. “For us specifically, me and my wife, we lost our camper. Everything was completely destroyed. Gone. There wasn’t anything left but the toilet and the frame. And both of our vehicles were also totaled,” said Andrew Klauditz, a Claremore resident affected by the tornado. Andrew is just one of many Claremore residents who have been helped by the Rogers County Disaster Assistance Organization after the Memorial Day tornado. Residents are continuing to pick up the pieces from what's left of their homes three weeks later. Some lost their homes in this disaster and others are trying to hold the city of Claremore together. One of those organizations is CRCDA who are providing shelter for people after they received a generous amount of aid from one local bank. “I only see the need in helping out a fellow citizen and getting back to their normalcy that they rightfully deserve. No one asked for a tornado to come and rip apart their life. They didn’t do anything to cause it, but we can do something to fix it. And we need the donations and funds to help that,” said team member of Claremore & Rogers disaster assistance, Kacey Alchammat. Andrew said that this organization helped his family find a new place to live on a campsite and they didn’t charge his family a dime. “It was a relief. That’s something a lot of people have been asking me. You must be ecstatic, you must be excited? No, I can breathe. That’s the most important part for me at least. Is that now I can breathe.” This organization started two days after the tornado struck Claremore. They set a goal of $500,000. Right now, they’ve reached 20% of that goal while receiving nearly 400 applications. The funds they receive are donor funds. On Friday, they will be presenting checks to households to start the re-building process. “It’s a blessing to help anyone in need. When you come out here and you just see the depravity and destruction of what’s happened; and the way that people are having to live currently, said Alchammat. They're living with water leaking in their roof, people needing medical attention that can’t afford it can’t provide it.” You can donate to the Claremore & Rogers County disaster assistance organization [here](https://www.kindridgiving.com/App/Form/078d09be-cad6-4696-b29c-420936aa81b0).",

    "text": "MP instaura inquérito para investigar prefeitura de SP por compra superfaturada de água Garrafas de água sem gás teriam sido adquiridas por R$ 5,52, em média, no Carnaval deste ano. Prefeitura disse que vai prestar esclarecimentos O promotor Ricardo Manuel Castro, do Ministério Público de São Paulo, instaurou um inquérito civil para apurar a suposta compra superfaturada de água mineral pela prefeitura de São Paulo no Carnaval de 2024. O objeto de investigação é uma suspeita de que a Secretaria Municipal das Subprefeituras teria pago à empresa AMBP Promoções e Eventos Empresariais R$ 1.391.040,00 por 252 mil garrafas de água sem gás de 500 ml para distribuir aos foliões. Na média, isso significa que cada garrafa custou R$ 5,52, o que \"supera em muito o valor médio da unidade de água [na cidade] em R$ 1,95\", segundo o promotor. A representação foi apresentada por vereadores do PSOL na capital paulista. Em nota enviada ao SBT News, a prefeitura afirmou que a Secretaria \"recebeu o ofício encaminhado pelo Ministério Público e vai prestar os esclarecimentos necessários no tempo devido\" e reforçou que a licitação para o investimento \"atendeu aos requisitos legais\". O que é um inquérito civil? O inquérito civil é um processo exclusivo do Ministério Público, órgão que tem como compromisso fiscalizar e demandar a investigação de condutas dos órgãos públicos. Dentro dessa premissa, o MP pode instaurar esse procedimento quando há suspeita de violação de direitos coletivos – nesse caso, o objeto é o emprego superfaturado de recursos públicos, que lesaria o contribuinte. O que acontece agora? O inquérito civil não tem natureza acusatória e, portanto, não tornou as entidades envolvidas acusadas. Além da abertura de investigação, o promotor determinou que a prefeitura e a AMBP prestem esclarecimentos a respeito dos eventos investigados em até 15 dias.",
