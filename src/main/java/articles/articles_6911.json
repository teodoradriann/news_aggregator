    "title": "Hamas says it accepts Gaza ceasefire proposal of Egypt, Qatar | Mena – Gulf News",
    "text": "CAIRO: Militant group Hamas on Monday agreed to a ceasefire proposal in the seven-month-old war with Israel in Gaza, hours after the Israeli military told residents to evacuate some parts of Rafah, which has been sheltering more than a million displaced people.\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that the group accepted their ceasefire proposal, according to a brief statement from Hamas, which gave no details of the accord.\nIsrael to send delegation to mediators to discuss 'Hamas proposal' Israel's government said Monday it will send a delegation to mediators to discuss a Gaza truce proposal accepted by Hamas, which it called \"far from Israel's demands\".\n\"Even though the Hamas proposal is far from Israel's essential demands, Israel will send a working-level delegation to the mediators,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement after a war cabinet meeting.\n\"The war cabinet has unanimously decided that Israel is continuing the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas in order to advance the release of our hostages and the other objectives of the war,\" the statement also said. The Islamist faction said in a statement that its chief, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar’s prime minister and Egypt’s intelligence chief of its acceptance of their proposal.\n\"Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of Hamas movement, conducted a telephone call with the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani, and with the Egyptian intelligence minister, Mr Abbas Kamel, and informed them of Hamas's approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement,\" the group said in a statement published on its official website.\nWhite House reviews Hamas response to Gaza ceasefire proposal The White House on Monday said it was reviewing a response by the Hamas group to a ceasefire and hostage release proposal, as it continued to press Israel to halt plans for a ground invasion of Rafah.\nCIA Director Williams Burns was in the region having discussions on the proposal, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. He declined to provide any details, saying he did not want to jeopardize any progress toward a deal.\n\"We want to get these hostages out, we want to get a ceasefire in place for six weeks, we want to increase humanitarian assistance,\" Kirby said, adding that reaching an agreement would be the \"absolute best outcome.\"\nA senior Hamas official said that Israel must decide whether it accepts or “obstructs” the truce.\n“After Hamas agreed to the mediators’ proposal for a ceasefire, the ball is now in the court of Israeli occupation, whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the negotiations.\nThere were no immediate details over what the agreement entailed.\nAn unnamed Israeli official Quote: d by the Reuters news agency said Hamas has approved a “softened” Egyptian proposal that is not acceptable to Israel. The proposal included “far-reaching” conclusions that Israel will not support, the official said.\n“This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,” said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nAlso read ‘No force in the world will stop us’: Gaza war rages as Hamas studies truce proposal Gaza truce effort builds with Hamas to respond to Israel proposal Hamas weighs Gaza truce proposal The agreement, should it take effect, would be the first truce since a week-long pause in the fighting in November, and follows months of failed attempts at pausing the fighting to free hostages and allow more aid into Gaza.\nCelebrations in Rafah As the news broke, crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets of Rafah. People were crying tears of happiness, chanting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”) and shooting in the air in celebration of the news, An AFP correspondent said.\nThere had been concerns that the ceasefire talks being held in Cairo had stalled after Hamas official Izzat Al Rashiq warned that any Israeli operation in Rafah would put the truce talks in jeopardy.\nThe city, on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip, has been the last sanctuary for around half of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, pushed south by Israel’s seven-month-old assault.\nIsrael and Hamas have been negotiating for weeks through mediators toward a potential truce that would include the release of hostages held in Gaza and of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",

    "title": "More Women Are Getting Breast Cancer In Their 20s: Expert Decodes The Crisis",
    "text": "“Breast cancer” was presumed to be a “disease of the elderly”. This might have been true almost a decade ago. But the disease has shown a significant shift in its trend in recent years. In 2019, the incidence rate of breast cancer amongst young women, even in their 20s, was about 49 per 100,000, which is quite high compared to older statistics. More concerningly, women under 40 are nearly 40 per cent more likely to die from their breast cancer than older women. Younger women are more likely to develop an aggressive form of the disease called “Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)” and HER2-positive variants.\nHence, let us start by understanding the causes of breast cancer at an early age. Even though we may not be able to control most of these causes, awareness about them will help to their early detection.\n- Family history: We all must be aware of any breast cancer history in our family, especially our mother, grandmother or aunt, especially anyone with breast cancer before the age of 50. Then there are other important histories like any males in the family with breast cancer; bilateral breast cancer; ovarian, pancreatic or metastatic prostatic cancer and Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Hence, discussing in the family and trying to find out any positive history is the simplest thing that we can do.\n- Hormonal contraceptives: They can significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.\n- Genetic mutations: Women with genetic mutations like BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2 are at much higher risk of developing breast cancer at a\nyounger age.Once aware, these women can start screening at a much earlier age. Other mutations in genes like PTEN, BARD1, STK11/LKB1, CDH1 AND CHEK2 can also increase the risk of breast cancer. - Reproductive history: Menarche before the age of 12 years has also been associated with increased risk. First pregnancy over the age of 30 or having no children at all. Pregnancy before the age of 30 and breastfeeding are both found to protect against breast cancer.\n- Lifestyle choices: Smoking, regular alcohol drinking and obesity/ sedentary lifestyles are also known to be associated or contributing factors.\n- Previous radiation therapy to the chest.\n- Precancerous breast conditions like atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.\nImportance of screening\nScreening means checking for breast cancer even when there are no symptoms. While many of the above-mentioned causes are unavoidable, spreading awareness and screening can help in early detection and may also save the young lady from some treatments like chemotherapy, which may seriously affect her quality of life.\nFertility and early menopause are major concerns in young women. Detection of breast cancer at an early stage may save the patient`s breast and even any further treatments.\nScreening guidelines\n- Monthly self-breast examination and annual clinical breast examination with their doctors are recommended for early detection. Any new palpable lump, change in the size of the previously known lump, change in any of the breast size, skin dimpling, nipple areolar complex changes, blood-stained spontaneous nipple discharge, or even any lump in the armpits must be viewed with concern and must be immediately investigated.\n- After clinical breast examination, the first and safest investigation recommended in young women is ultrasound.\n- Although\nmammographyis not recommended as a screening tool in young women, it may be recommended if needed for diagnosis. - MRI breast also plays a beautiful role, especially in young women with higher risk, as a screening tool and also as a diagnostic tool.\nSo, what should be our protocol? The following are the recommendations for screening and diagnostic mammography and other investigations.\nBreast Screening Recommendation from Breast Imaging Society, India\nAge for mammography-based screening in India |\n40 - 70 years age |\nFrequency - Annual |\nHigh-risk group screening (mammograms along with breast MRI) |\nBegin at the age of 30 years or 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the first degree relative with breast cancer (not before 25 years) |\nFrequency - Annual |\n|\n>70 years age |\nThe decision is made based on the woman’s comorbidities and life expectancy. |\n- High-risk group screening (mammograms along with breast MRI) is appropriate if there is a lifetime\nrisk of breast cancerof about 20% according to risk assessment tools that are mainly based on family history, if woman has a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation or has a first-degree relative with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation (and has not had genetic testing herself), if woman has a first-degree relative with premenopausal breast cancer, if she has had radiation therapy to the chest when she was between the ages of 10 and 30 years.\nI would like to conclude by stressing the fact that it's imperative for us also to keep up with the shifting trends of the disease, be more aware of our bodies and be vigilant with our screening protocols. This will surely help us in nabbing the disease when it can be controlled with much simpler treatment options.\nAuthored by Dr Namrata Singal Sawant, Director and Senior Breast & Women`s Imaging Consultant Radiologist at “Vcare Imaging Diagnostic Centre”, Mumbai. | M.B.B.S., M.D., Fellowship in Breast Imaging (U.S.).",

    "title": "At least 15 arrested after mob attack on Christian families in Sargodha",
    "text": "Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr. Usman Anwar announced on Saturday that 15 suspects were arrested after two Christian families were rescued from an angry mob attacking their homes in Sargodha’s Mujahid Colony. Sargodha District Police Officer (DPO) Asad Ejaz Malhi told Dawn.com that the incident was triggered by alleged desecration, but stressed that a large police presence prevented any deaths. “When the police arrived, the mob had gathered outside the houses. Officers secured the area and safely evacuated all residents,” Malhi said, adding that extra police units were deployed across the city to protect the Christian community. “The police dispersed the crowd peacefully,” he added. Social media videos showed a mob surrounding a bloodied man and others, including teenagers, destroying furniture. Another video showed a fire outside a house. DPO Malhi claimed these were “fake videos” and insisted no one was injured. “The police are keeping order,” he said. However, a relative of an injured person told Dawn.com that his uncle was in critical condition at a hospital and the family was not allowed to see him. A statement from Minority Rights March said videos of the incident showed a mob attacking a 70-year-old man “instigated by a local cleric” and setting his home and factory on fire. “The videos clearly show Punjab police officers present at the scene as silent spectators, suggesting their approval and support of the attackers,” the statement said. The Punjab police stated that Sargodha Regional Police Officer Shariq Kamal, DPO Malhi, and other officials responded quickly when the incident was reported, saving 10 lives and controlling the situation. “There was no loss of life, more than 10 police officers and personnel were also injured due to stone pelting by the angry people. The Sargodha police risked their lives to rescue the families and pulled them out from the crowd. Thanks to the timely action of the police. Sargodha was spared a great tragedy,” the statement said, adding that the situation in the city was “completely peaceful and under control”.

    "text": "How you can give a gift to a million people\nFREE Catholic Classes\nJesus gave the gift of salvation to billions of people. It is the single greatest act of mercy and generosity in all history. It is the very basis of our Catholic faith. But He left us with one responsibility. To share this gift with others. In fact, He commanded us to do so.\nHi readers, it seems you use Catholic Online a lot; that's great! It's a little awkward to ask, but we need your help. If you have already donated, we sincerely thank you. We're not salespeople, but we depend on donations averaging $14.76 and fewer than 1% of readers give. If you donate just $5.00, the price of your coffee, Catholic Online School could keep thriving. Thank you. Help Now >\nCan you give a gift to one million people?\nHighlights\n[Deacon Keith Fournier](/search/?q=Deacon+Keith+Fournier)\n12/28/2023 (14 hours ago)\nPublished in\n[Living Faith](/news/hf/faith/)\nNot everyone can preach. But we can still do our part. This year, we are asking you to give a gift that will help a million people.Â\nCatholic Online School has reached the incredible milestone of one million student enrollments! By providing everyone with a FREE, world-class, Catholic education, we are evangelizing and converting people. We are helping lapsed Catholics return to their faith. We are catechizing the young and old alike. We provide refreshers for lifelong Catholics. And because we are magisterial, many schools and parishes are using our courses to teach.Â\nWe provide all this to you and millions of others, for FREE.Â\nOf course, these resources are free to use, but they are not free to produce. They come with costs that must be paid. Each course we produce costs us to pay for the writing, editing, production, hosting, and much more. Dozens of people work behind the scenes on each course, lending their God-given talents to building and operating this incredible school.Â\nTo keep Catholic Online School free, and to keep doing this important work, we need support from private individuals like you. Just as Jesus and the Apostles relied upon the generosity of others to perform their missionary work, we also rely upon people like you.Â\nWe know times are tough. We've noticed too. We've tightened our belts because this is such important work. And we don't want anyone to feel bad if they can't give now. But if you can do something, even just $5, it makes a difference. When you donate to this Apostolate, you are literally giving a gift to a million people. How many in history can say they gave presents to a million people? Not many, but now you can.Â\nPlease give generously what you can today to keep Catholic Online School FREE for anyone, anywhere!\n[Join the Movement](/newsletters/)\nWhen you sign up below, you don't just join an email list - you're joining an entire movement for Free world class Catholic education.\n-\n-\nMysteries of the Rosary\n-\nSt. Faustina Kowalska\n-\nLitany of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n-\nSaint of the Day for Wednesday, Oct 4th, 2023\n-\nPopular Saints\n-\nSt. Francis of Assisi\n-\nBible\n-\nFemale / Women Saints\n-\n7 Morning Prayers you need to get your day started with God\n-\nLitany of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nCatholic PDFs - Print - Free Light a Virtual Prayer Candle\nDaily Catholic\n[Daily Readings for Friday, December 29, 2023](/bible/daily_reading/?select_date=2023-12-29) [St. Aileran: Saint of the Day for Friday, December 29, 2023](/saints/sofd.php?month=December&day=29) [I Came to You Late: Prayer of the Day for Friday, December 29, 2023](/prayers/prayeroftheday/?select_date=2023-12-29) [Daily Readings for Thursday, December 28, 2023](/bible/daily_reading/?select_date=2023-12-28) [St. Anthony the Hermit: Saint of the Day for Thursday, December 28, 2023](/saints/sofd.php?month=December&day=28) [Litany to the Sacred Head of Jesus: Prayer of the Day for Thursday, December 28, 2023](/prayers/prayeroftheday/?select_date=2023-12-28)\nFREE Catholic Classes Pick a class, you can learn anything\n[Saints & Angels](/saints/)\n[Prayers](/prayers/)\nYour Donation Matters Most | Help Save Catholic Education\nCopyright 2023 Catholic Online.
