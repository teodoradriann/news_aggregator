    "text": "Football December 05, 2024 Wisconsin football earns AFCA Academic Achievement Award Football matched the program's highest-ever graduation success rate this year Football December 05, 2024 Wisconsin football earns AFCA Academic Achievement Award Football matched the program's highest-ever graduation success rate this year MADISON, Wis. – For the first time ever, Wisconsin football has been awarded the American Football Coaches Association's (AFCA) 2024 Academic Achievement Award, as announced by the Memphis Touchdown Club on Thursday. Wisconsin earned the award after posting a 91% graduation success rate in 2024, matching the program's highest mark ever. Wisconsin joins Air Force, Clemson, Liberty, Notre Dame, Virginia and Wake Forest in receiving the 2024 Academic Achievement Award. Head coaches of the winning schools will be honored during the 2025 AFCA Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday, Jan. 12. Wisconsin's roster featured 13 players who had earned their degrees prior to the beginning of the 2024 season. 15 Badgers are on track to graduate this month with degrees from the University of Wisconsin. This year's award marks the 13th time the NCAA's Graduation Success Rate (GSR) one-year formula has been used to select the winner. The GSR is based on a six-year graduation window for student-athletes and holds institutions accountable for transfer students, unlike the federal graduation rate. The GSR also accounts for midyear enrollees and non-scholarship students at schools that do not offer athletics aid. Under GSR calculation, institutions are not penalized for outgoing transfer students who leave in good academic standing. These outgoing transfers are passed to the receiving institution's GSR cohort. The Academic Achievement Award was established by the College Football Association in 1981. The award recognized the CFA-member Football Bowl Subdivision institution with the highest graduation rate among members of its football team. When the CFA disbanded in 1997, the AFCA stepped in to present the award. Print Friendly Version",

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link)\nDes Boeing 737 MAX cloués au sol après deux crashes en 2018 et en 2019, le 18 novembre 2020 à Seattle\nLe constructeur aéronautique Boeing a officiellement contesté les conclusions du ministère américain de la Justice, qui a prévenu mi-mai d'un risque de poursuites pénales pour non-respect d'un accord conclu après deux crashes ayant fait 346 morts.\nL'avionneur devait répondre au plus tard jeudi. Ce qui a été fait, a indiqué à l'AFP une source proche du dossier, sans autre détail.\nL'agence Bloomberg a rapporté que Boeing avait adressé sa réponse mercredi, niant toute violation. Contacté par l'AFP mercredi, Boeing avait renvoyé à ses déclarations du 14 mai: \"Nous estimons avoir honoré les conditions de cet accord\".\nLe constructeur a refusé de commenter ses communications avec le ministère de la Justice (DOJ), précisant \"continuer de dialoguer en toute transparence\" avec lui. Le ministère n'a pas souhaité commenter non plus.\nDans un courrier adressé le 14 mai au juge d'un tribunal fédéral texan, le ministère a estimé que Boeing n'avait \"pas respecté ses obligations\" prévues dans l'accord dit de poursuite différée (DPA) signé le 7 janvier 2021 et lié aux crashes de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et 2019 -dus à un problème de conception.\nAccusé de fraude dans le processus de certification du 737 MAX -son avion vedette-, Boeing avait accepté de payer 2,5 milliards de dollars et s'était engagé, entre autres, à renforcer son programme de conformité.\nMais l'avionneur multiplie, surtout depuis début 2023, les problèmes de production et de contrôle qualité.\nIl est désormais cerné de toutes parts depuis l'incident en vol sur un 737 MAX 9 d'Alaska Airlines le 5 janvier, dont une porte-bouchon -opercule condamnant une issue de secours redondante- s'est détachée.\nL'affaire de trop, qui a déclenché audits et enquêtes des régulateurs, de la justice, de commissions parlementaires. Ces travaux ont identifié des problèmes de non-conformité dans la production et des lacunes du contrôle qualité.\nTrois des quatre familles d'avions commerciaux actuellement fabriqués par Boeing sont visés par des enquêtes de la FAA pour des problèmes de qualité: le 737, le 777 et le 787 Dreamliner.\nLe groupe a annoncé jeudi matin un nouveau souci repéré sur des Dreamliner en attente de livraison: des fixations internes au fuselage mal serrées. \"La flotte en service peut continuer à opérer en toute sécurité\", a-t-il assuré.\nLe Boeing 737 MAX 9 d'Alaska Airlines dont une porte condamnée s'est détachée en vol, à l'aéroport de Portland, le 23 janvier 2024 dans l'Oregon\nLa sécurité des avions de Boeing a quasiment monopolisé l'audition pendant près de deux heures jeudi matin de Mike Whitaker, patron du régulateur de l'aviation civile (FAA), devant la Commission sénatoriale sur le Commerce et le Transport au sujet de la supervision du secteur aérien.\n\"Ces problèmes sont vraiment contrariants\", a relevé Maria Cantwell, présidente démocrate de la Commission, déplorant une \"impression de déjà vu\".\nM. Whitaker, en poste depuis octobre 2023, a assuré que des mesures avaient étaient prises immédiatement après l'incident du 5 janvier, dont le plafonnement de la production du 737 MAX tant que la qualité ne serait pas retrouvée.\nLe constructeur a dû aussi élaborer, en collaboration avec la FAA, un plan complet pour y parvenir.\nLe régulateur a aussi déployé, pour la première fois, des inspecteurs parmi les chaînes de montage de Boeing et de Spirit AeroSystems, qui le fournit notamment en fuselages. Son objectif est d'en disséminer 55 mais la pénurie de personnel qualifié complique le recrutement, a indiqué M. Whitaker.\nLe site du crash d'un Boeing 737 MAX 8 d'Ethiopian Airways, près de Bishoftun, le 16 mars 2019 en Ethiopie\nL'accord de 2021 prévoyait l'expiration de la surveillance de Boeing après trois ans. Soit le 7 janvier 2024. Le ministère disposait ensuite de six mois pour se positionner puis décider d'engager ou non des poursuites.\nLes familles de victimes des deux accidents les réclament depuis le tout début, et encore plus depuis la récente série de déboires.\nReçues le 31 mai au ministère à Washington, elles ont fait part de leurs \"grandes craintes\" qu'il opte pour un accord de plaider-coupable avec Boeing, selon un communiqué de leurs avocats.\n\"Une simple transaction à l'amiable sans sanction ne remplirait pas\" la \"mission\" du ministère \"de rendre justice au grand public\", ont-ils prévenu, réclamant l'ouverture d'un procès dans les 70 jours légaux suivant le 7 juillet.\nLe ministère s'est engagé en mai à communiquer sa décision au tribunal texan au plus tard à cette date-là.\nDave Calhoun, patron de l'avionneur américain Boeing, le 24 janvier 2024 à Washington\nProchain passage difficile pour le groupe: l'audition très attendue de son patron Dave Calhoun le 18 juin par une commission d'enquête sénatoriale, devant laquelle quatre lanceurs d'alerte ont témoigné mi-avril.\nNommé directeur général début 2020 pour rétablir la situation après les crashes, M. Calhoun a été emporté par la crise actuelle et doit quitter son poste d'ici la fin de l'année.",

    "title": "‘I’m the real Mr Bates – my battle against the Post Office isn’t over yet’",
    "text": "When subpostmaster Alan Bates was accused of theft by his employers, he refused to back down. In 1998, he took over ownership of the local Post Office in Craig-y-Don, north [Wales](https://metro.co.uk/tag/wales/?ico=auto_link_entertainment_P2_LNK1), but two years later the business started struggling. At least that is what Alan was told. His experience, which turned out to be part of [one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in UK history](https://metro.co.uk/2022/02/15/what-was-the-post-office-horizon-scandal-16110574/), is the [ centre of the new four-part ITV drama series](https://metro.co.uk/2023/09/25/the-long-shadow-toby-jones-made-me-cry-playing-my-dad-dcs-dennis-hoban-19542389/?ico=mosaic_tag) Mr Bates vs The Post Office, starring [Toby Jones as Bates alongside Will Mellor, Katherine Kelly and Julie Hesmondhalgh](https://metro.co.uk/tag/toby-jones/). Soon after Alan started working for the company, the Post Office rolled out the Horizon computer system, supplied by Fujitsu, and suddenly unexplained losses started appearing in his accounts. Although his contract [said he was responsible ](https://metro.co.uk/2023/09/18/post-office-workers-wrongful-conviction-false-accounting-compensation-offered-19518576/)for having to pay the money, Alan refused and demanded the computer evidence to prove the cause of the losses. In 2003 his contract was terminated. Determined to prove he wasn’t at fault, over the following years he started tracking down other subpostmasters and subpostmistresses and despite each being told that they were the only ones experiencing these problems with Horizon, they were far from it. Thousands were being affected by the faulty system. As others faced the same horrors as Alan, the Post Office spent nearly 20 years taking 700 employees to court for theft, false accounting and fraud. Some went to prison following convictions, many others were financially ruined and more than 60 died without seeing justice or compensation. At least four took their own lives. Set to air after the final episode of the drama series is the documentary, Mr Bates vs The Post Office: The Real Story, which pieces together the impact of these appalling events, with those affected speaking about what they experienced. In it, Alan explains how he was ‘never accepting of the figure Horizon had thrown up each week’. ‘I wasn’t prepared to do that. They then said I had to do it or else, but I refused until I had access to the system and eventually, they terminated my contract without giving me any reason and that was it,’ he said. He added: ‘They walked off with my life savings and decided to give my post office to someone else.’ Many others faced financial ruin too, with Jo Hamilton from South Warnborough being charged with theft. While she ended up accepting a plea deal and pleaded guilty to false accounting, convinced she had been accidentally doing something wrong, she was then made liable for repaying £36,000. Jo, along with the help of her supportive community, helped pay it off, however, she has now accepted she won’t be able to retire for years to come and is working as a cleaner to make ends meet. After Alan and his partner, Suzanne Sercombe lost £65,000 in the process of giving up their business, they became determined to seek justice. It was in 2009 that the first meeting of thirty postmasters took place in Fenny Compton, Warwickshire where they shared their stories. Eventually, Alan and five others from the JFSA (Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance) took the Post Office to court on behalf of 555 claimants. A decade after that original meeting, it was ruled the missing money was the fault of computer errors and the Post Office was ordered to pay £58million in compensation for the false prosecutions. Judge Fraser described the Post Office denials about Horizon issues as ‘institutional obstinacy’. But after their legal costs were paid, the group were left with only £12million, which totalled to around £20,000 each, far less than some had lost. By 2020, the government had initiated an independent inquiry, which was then converted to a public one the following year, looking into whether the Post Office and software supplier Fujitsu knew about the faults in the IT system. It was intended to be completed a few months ago but is still ongoing. In the documentary, Alan makes it clear he’s not ready to stop and will continue to offer a voice to the people impacted by the scandal until they receive their full compensation. This year he also turned down an OBE, citing the fact he didn’t want to accept the honour whilst former Post Office boss Paula Vennells still had her CBE, which she was awarded in 2019. ‘The people who should be held to account are the people who have had a very cooshtie lifestyle on vast quantities of money whilst they’ve made hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals suffer whilst knowing the real truth of what’s been going on and denying it,’ Alan says. ‘Those are the people who should be held responsible.’ Mr Bates vs the Post Office is airing across four nights from January 1 at 9pm on ITV1. Also airing on January 4 is Mr Bates vs the Post Office: The Real Story at 10.45pmon ITV1. Got a story?

    "title": "Cristiano Ronaldo’s scoring record as Portugal star scores 900th career goal - Limerick Live",
    "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the 900th goal of his illustrious career after netting Portugal’s second during their Nations League clash with Croatia on Thursday night. Here, the PA news agency looks at the 39-year-old’s scoring record for club and country. Appearances: 31 Goals: 5 The future Portugal star played just one senior season in his homeland, demonstrating his potential with a handful of goals while only turning 18 late in the campaign. Appearances: 346 Goals: 145 That early promise earned him a move to Old Trafford, where he flourished first as a flying winger before adding regular goals to his game. He hit double figures for the first time in 2005-06 before three successive seasons of 20-plus goals, peaking with 31 in the Premier League and 42 in all competitions in 2007-08. His first spell brought a total of 118 goals in 293 games to persuade Real Madrid to part with a then-world record 94 million euros (£80million). A markedly less successful second spell in Manchester from 2021 to 2023 produced 27 goals in 54 games before an acrimonious end. Appearances: 438 Goals: 450 It was at Real from 2009 to 2018 that Ronaldo grew into the feared central striker he has become, as his rivalry with then-Barcelona star Lionel Messi saw both achieve scarcely believable scoring rates. Ronaldo had six straight seasons with over 50 goals in all competitions from 2010-11, scoring a goal a game or better in all but the first of those and astonishingly maintaining such a record over his nine-year spell as a whole. His best season brought him 61 goals in 54 games in 2014-15, surpassing his 60 in 55 in 2011-12. He beat Raul’s club records of 228 league goals and 323 in all competitions, became the Champions League’s record scorer – setting the single season record with 17 in 2013-14 – and reached 500 career goals for club and country. By the time he left Spain, his 311 LaLiga goals ranked second only to Messi. Ronaldo won two league titles and three Pichichi trophies as LaLiga’s top scorer, with four Champions Leagues and four Ballons d’Or to take his personal total to five of each. Appearances: 134 Goals: 101 While not matching the extraordinary heights of his time in Spain, Ronaldo remained prolific in his three years with Juve and helped them to two league titles and a Coppa Italia. He scored 28 goals in his debut season then 37 and 36, bringing up his century in his penultimate Serie A appearance. He was named Serie A footballer of the year for 2019 and 2020 and won an Outstanding Career Achievement honour at FIFA’s 2021 The Best awards. Appearances: 74 Goals: 68 A move to Saudi Arabia after his falling-out with United was viewed as a kind of footballing semi-retirement – and was followed by Messi decamping to Major League Soccer in the United States – but the goals have continued to flow. Ronaldo scored 14 in 16 Saudi Pro League games in his debut season then 35 in 31, and is quickly back up and running this term. Appearances: 213 Goals: 131 His country’s talisman since Luis Figo’s retirement following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo has rewritten the record books. Soaring past Ali Daei’s record of 108 goals in men’s internationals, Ronaldo took 114 caps to reach 50 goals but has 81 in 89 games since. He helped his side win the European Championship in 2016 and is the competition’s record scorer, both with 14 goals at the finals and 55 including qualifiers. His appearance total and his feats of scoring at five different World Cups and 10 consecutive World Cups and Euros combined are also records.

    "title": "Selena Gomez Teases New Music After Being Seen in the Studio With Fiancé Benny Blanco",
    "text": "Selena Gomez Teases She’s Working on New Music After Being Seen in the Studio With Benny Blanco\nSelena Gomez is fueling fans’ anticipation for new music with a subtle yet tantalizing tease. On Wednesday, Jan. 22, the 32-year-old took to Instagram Stories to share a video from what appeared to be her home recording studio. Donning oversized headphones, Gomez began the clip with a close-up of her face before dramatically panning to a computer monitor, strategically covered by a big red heart emoji. As she turned the camera back to herself, Gomez’s widened eyes and glowing excitement suggested something big is brewing.\nIn the background, eagle-eyed viewers caught sight of large studio speakers and a sleek keyboard, hinting at serious creative work underway. And this would align perfectly with a recent TikTok of producer and Gomez’s new fiancé Benny Blanco.\nThe 36-year-old offered fans another glimpse into the couple’s studio sessions. He replied to a fan comment—“Benny please make some new songs for our queen”—with a video on Jan. 17 ahead of the anticipated (yet short-lived) TikTok ban. In the clip, Blanco opened the door to a room, revealing the Disney Channel alum adjusting a microphone. Beaming, she greeted him with a playful “Hi.” Watch the TikTok here.\nThe two, who announced their engagement in December 2024 after a little more than a year of dating but several years of friendship, have a history of crafting hits together, including “Same Old Love” and “Kill Em With Kindness” from Gomez’s Revival album, as well as last year’s chart-topper, “Single Soon.”\nGomez had previously revealed she was nearing the end of her music career, focusing her energy on acting, where she felt she had only begun to scratch the surface of her potential. However, in a recent interview on Radio Andy’s The Jess Cagle Show with Julia Cunningham, Gomez opened up about how her recent acting projects have reinvigorated her passion for music. Her roles in the award-winning Netflix film Emilia Pérez and the Hulu series Only Murders in the Building have sparked further creativity.\n“More than anything, I’ve never felt so inspired. The work I’m doing now is everything I’ve worked hard to do, and I’m so proud and so fulfilled,” Gomez said. “I’m still, you know, making my way as I go, but I really am extremely lucky, and I think music is gonna be in my life forever in whatever shape or form … I think it has truly inspired me, this whole experience.”",

    "text": "Fears for egg shortage as new bird flu case rips though third Victorian poultry farm\nA third bird flu case has been detected on a Euroa poultry farm near to where the last two devastating outbreaks occurred in the Victoria’s north this month, Agriculture Victoria said on Thursday.\nThe latest H7N8 avian influenza case occurred within a “restricted area” and was “not unexpected,” Victoria’s acting chief veterinary officer Dr Cameron Bell said.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Bird flu outbreak spreads.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\nWith the “humane destruction” of birds now completed at the first two sites infected this month, Agriculture Victoria said: “Work will start at the new property soon.”\nThe first of the latest H7N8 cases came just days after an eradication announcement was made by Agriculture Minister Julie Collins, and the unfortunate reversal of that position has reignited fears for a continued egg shortage.\nAs buying limits remain in Aussie supermarkets, Dr Bell thanked reassured Victorians that supermarket eggs and poultry products are still safe to eat.\nAt the time of the eradication announcement, more than 1.8 million birds had been killed in a quest to rid the nation of the disease after Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT experienced outbreaks.\nBut the strain which triggered the 2024 egg shortage impacting shelves today is different to the one now impacting the Euroa farms, the Australian Government said diagnostic testing at CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong confirmed.\nIt is also different than the H5 strain, which is currently plaguing every continent except Australia.\nThe latest case, announced on Thursday, occurred within in a quarantined control area, which covers any producers within a 5km radius of infected properties.\n“This is part of a larger control area in Strathbogie Shire, east of the Goulburn Valley Fwy,” Agriculture Victoria said.\n“The goal is to prevent movements that could spread the virus.”\nThose in Euroa, Violet Town, Longwood, Ruffy, Avenel, and Strathbogie, are all required to follow the specific rules which characterise the control zone, including a housing requirement for properties with 50 or more birds.\n“If you are in the control or restricted areas, you cannot move birds, products (including eggs and manure) or equipment into, out of, or within the area without permit,” Bell said.\n“This includes selling or giving away eggs from your poultry — these must not leave your property.”\nBell thanked the impacted properties for their cooperation and stressed that “a strong biosecurity system relies on everyone playing their part.”\n- With AAP\nOriginally published on 7NEWS",
