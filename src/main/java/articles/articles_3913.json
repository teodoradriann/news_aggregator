    "text": "'We're going to catch less bad stuff,' Facebook tycoon admits, but it's worth it to get Trump off his back Updated Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced a whole bunch of changes designed to \"get back to our roots around free expression\" that, among other things, include ditching fact-checking moderators, and loosening content policies to allow previously restricted speech to proliferate.\nThe Instagram supremo gave a quick rundown of the changes in a series of posts on Threads this morning, and a video saying much the same embedded in a blog post outlining plans by the corporation's new chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan.\nTL;DR? Expect your Facebook feed to start looking a lot more like X, the site better known as Twitter, including the return of political content that was previously down-ranked in an attempt to keep the platform civil. Meta, which has billions of users worldwide, now intends to bring back the political argy-bargy, which it calls \"civic content.\"\n\"In recent years we've developed increasingly complex systems to manage content across our platforms, partly in response to societal and political pressure to moderate content,\" Kaplan said. \"This approach has gone too far.\"\nAnd thus, Meta has outlined a series of adjustments it plans to make, such as ending its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a community notes system like the one on Elon Musk's X, which Kaplan said has worked well for that site.\nRather than have outside panels of journalists and other moderators weigh up whether people's posts should be labeled or hidden away as hoaxes, false, or misleading, and give those recommendations to Meta to consider, instead a more crowdsourced-based approach to labeling will be taken, we're told.\n\"Fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US,\" Zuckerberg claimed in his video discussing the about-face changes.\n\"What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas.\"\nFact…\nBrandon Vigliarolo",
