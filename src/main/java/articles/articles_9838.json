    "title": "'The Netherlands Full of Jesus': Dutch Pentecost Conference Sees 63K Participants Glorify God | CBN News",
    "text": "The month of May brought some amazing examples of the power of God on display around the world from multiple massive baptisms in California, Florida, and Texas to a huge march for Jesus in Paris, France. But there's one example we missed, until now – a stunningly huge gathering for Christ in the Netherlands.\nMissiologists have long considered Europe to be post-Christian, and the Netherlands is seen as a major example of that as the Dutch country has embraced atheism, legalized drugs, and publicly glorified prostitution.\nBut roughly 60,000 Christians, a stunning number for any European country, showed up less than two weeks ago in the Netherlands to publicly praise the name of Jesus at the 54th annual Opwekking Pentecost Conference on the grounds of Walibi Holland.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Opwekking (@opwekking)\nThe faith-based organization shares its mission over the last 60 years has been to follow \"Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit,\" and the conference held over Pentecost Sunday weekend had 63,000 people unashamedly glorifying God and an additional 700,000 participating online, according to the Opwekking Foundation .\n\"Revival means following Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit. This is our desire: The Netherlands full of Jesus,\" the organization wrote on Instagram.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Youth.Opwekking (@youth.opwekking)\nGospel artist Travis Greene led worship at the four-day conference and Pastor Pete Greig, founder of THE 24-7 Prayer Movement, was one of several speakers to share an uplifting message with attendees.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Youth.Opwekking (@youth.opwekking)\nAccording to the Netherlands Institute for Social Research, more than half of the Dutch identify as atheist or agnostic. A 2018 survey reveals that 69% of the population have never attended a church service and 29% of people considered themselves atheists.\n\"From the mid-1960s until today, this religious and political structure of the Netherlands has slowly dissolved and society has become more secular. Consequently, the percentage of people who proclaim to be active believers has decreased by two-thirds,\" wrote Benjamin Roberts for The Holland Times .\nIn a 2021 survey, the Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS), the official source for the country's government stats, reported that 57 percent of the population aged 15 or older in the Netherlands declared no religious affiliation.\nThe Netherlands is one of the very few countries in the world whose majority is mostly irreligious, meaning atheism, agnosticism, and other forms of irreligion.\n\"Currently, only a small minority of the population (between 14% to 28%) still believe that God is personally concerned with each individual's wellbeing, that the Bible is the Word of God, and that there is life after death,\" Roberts writes. \"People nowadays no longer look for the answers to the meaning of life in organized religions such as Christianity...Instead, they seek to find meaning in life from within.\"\nThese statistics are something Opwekking General Director Ruben Flach has been working to change for the last ten years.\nIn his farewell message at the Opwekking, he encouraged attendees to embrace the conference's theme of \"Closer\" by passionately pursuing God.\n\"The effect of the coming of the Holy Spirit is more powerful than miracles and signs: it causes people to go into the world to bring the gospel,\" he shared.\n\"We read in the Bible that God draws near to those who draw near to Him,\" he shared. \"People who respond to His invitation to come closer...It makes us grateful for what God is doing in the Netherlands and also digitally to so many other places. And that is also why we organize this conference every year: we desire that people become familiar with who Jesus is and with the powerful work of the Holy Spirit.\"\nAccording to the foundation, Flach is retiring from his position on July 1 but sees Opwekking continuing on a trajectory to win souls for Jesus Christ.\n\"The Pentecost Conference no longer belongs to Opwekking, but to the Netherlands. Given by God to us all,\" he told the crowd.\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\nShare This article",

    "text": "Сегодня Роскомнадзор после нескольких дней молчания официально подтвердил слухи о частичной блокировке звонков в WhatsApp и Telegram. Ограничения ввели якобы из-за распространяющихся посредством звонков в этих мессенджерах случаев мошенничества, и теперь всем в качестве альтернативы предлагают перейти на национальный мессенджер Max, который, к слову, сегодня установил себе и Сергей Собянин.\nПравда, не всем такая идея по душе: многие из принципа не хотят пользоваться Max, который чересчур уж агрессивно навязывают людям, и ищут другие альтернативы. Среди самых популярных обсуждаемых замен частично заблокированных мессенджеров — платформа Google Meet.\nНа фоне новостей о блокировке звонков приложение взлетело на вторую строчку в рейтинге приложений среди социальных сетей в AppStore. На данный момент пользователи называют его лучшей альтернативой для онлайн-звонков. Впрочем, первое место в рейтинге занимает сам Max.\nОсновное недовольство вокруг отечественной платформы строится на том, что переход на Max — принудительный. По крайней мере туда переносят переписки в большинстве государственных организаций, а недавно управляющим компаниям Москвы поручили перевести в национальный мессенджер все домовые чаты.\nНе самая плоха замена, кстати. Не так удобно, конечно, но зато работает везде.",

    "text": "Rachel Branston of Ceremonies With Rachel (07875 417476) has updated her celebrant services to provide unity ceremonies for weddings in South West England.\nBristol, United Kingdom - December 29, 2023 —\nRachel Branston, a wedding celebrant in Somerset, England, announced that she is now offering couples a selection of unity ceremonies for their weddings. Branston helps couples design personalised wedding ceremonies and offers symbolic rituals such as handfasting, circling and unity candle lighting.\nFor more information, visit https://ceremonieswithrachel.com/unity-ceremony\nRachel Branston is a wedding celebrant working in Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Bristol and surrounding areas. Following the update, she aims to provide individuals getting married in South West England with a symbolic means of signifying their marriage with a unity ceremony.\nA unity ceremony is a ritual performed during a wedding ceremony to represent unification. It can be secular, religious or historical and may also incorporate family members to represent the joining of the couple’s families.\nThese ceremonies are usually performed after exchanging wedding vows and are widely varied. Rituals that couples can choose from include the Anniversary Capsule, which entails putting together a capsule with mementoes from the wedding, photos and love letters that would then be sealed and opened on an anniversary of the couple’s choosing.\nAnother ceremonial ritual is the use of unity candles. This practice involves the couple lighting two different candles and then lighting a larger one with their individually lit candles, which symbolizes their new life together as a team. Other rituals include Tree Planting, Wine or Beer Blending and Braiding of the Cross — each holds varying significance unique to the couple’s beliefs or personalities.\nFor those planning an outdoor wedding, there are also unity ceremony ideas specific to the outdoors. One such ritual, ideal for a beach wedding, is Sand Pouring, where the blending of different coloured sand represents the mixing of personalities or the couple’s individual lives merging into one.\nAs an organist and pianist who has played at hundreds of weddings, Branston also offers couples the opportunity to have an original song written about their love story and featured in their ceremony, wedding video or played during their first dance. Other than weddings, Ceremonies With Rachel provides services for baby naming, vow renewal, divorce celebration, funerals and more.\nRachel Branston said: “All life’s key events deserve a ceremony reflecting your values, beliefs and personalities. I’m here to help you create and deliver a unique ceremony that is all about you, your family and your friends.”\nGo to https://ceremonieswithrachel.com for details.\n Rachel Branston\n Ceremonies With Rachel\nAddress: Highfields, The Wrangle Compton Martin, Bristol, England BS40 6LB, United Kingdom\nWebsite: https://www.ceremonieswithrachel.com\nSource: PressCable\nRelease ID: 89117592\nShould you identify any discrepancies, concerns, or inaccuracies in the content provided in this press release or require assistance with a press release takedown, we strongly urge you to notify us promptly by contacting responsive team is committed to addressing your concerns within 8 hours by taking necessary actions to resolve identified issues diligently or guiding you through the necessary steps for removal.

    "text": "Football News\nPremier League: Amad Diallo proves to be the hero once again for Manchester United\nRuben Amorim has unearthed a real star in Amad Diallo ever since his arrival to the club and the Ivorian winger has proved to be the club's shining light this season and was the hero once again tonight.\nNew Delhi: Manchester United have been a real topsy turvy team this season, especially since the arrival of Ruben Amorim to the club. The Red Devils have managed impressive results like a win over Manchester City, draw to Liverpool, win over Arsenal in the FA Cup but have struggled against lesser opposition. However, there has been one consistent shining light for the club since Amroim’s arrival and that has been the rediscovery of Amad Diallo.\nThe Ivorian winger joined the club in the summer of 2021 but struggled for consistency both in terms of form and game time on the pitch for the club. Since the arrival of Ruben Amorim, Amad Diallo has been a consistent starter for the club and proved his worth once again with a man of the match performance against the Saints. Manchester United were staring in the face of defeat up until the 80th minute as they were down 1-0 at home.\n⚽—82′\n⚽—90′ AMAD.[pic.twitter.com/5Ckr8Cgrje]— B/R Football (@brfootball)[January 16, 2025]\nUp stepped the club’s golden boy, Amad Diallo and produced a fine effort past Aaron Ramsdale to make it 1-1 for the Red Devils, breaking Southampton’s hearts. The game seemed to be headed towards a well deserved draw for both teams but Amad still had something the say. Christian Eriksen found the Ivorian with a perfectly dinked ball in the box and the winger produced a beautiful volley to complete the comeback for his side in the 90th minute to make it 2-1. He still wasn’t done on the night and capitalized on a heavy touch from Taylor Harwood Bellis in his own box to smash the ball into the empty net to grab his first career hattrick and win the game 3-1 for his side. He single handedly dragged Manchester United to victory from the jaws of defeat and had the whole of Old Trafford signing his name during injury time. The boy is certainly special and Ruben Amorim has unearthed a gem for the Red Devils.\nSet piece troubles still haunt Manchester United\nManchester United on set pieces:[pic.twitter.com/tbgDecJUEC]— B/R Football (@brfootball)[January 16, 2025]\nWhile Amad Diallo rescued the club once again, it wasn’t a great performance from the Red Devils with the club struggling for most of the game. They went behind in the first half to a team that had only scored 12 goals in the entire season prior to tonight’s game and had the worst scoring record in the league. In what has become a recurrent theme for the club, they once again went behind to a corner, making this the 10th goal conceded that they conceded from a corner this season.\nIt is the most that a club have conceded in this Premier League season and was the first goal Southampton scored from a corner. The Saints had failed to score from their previous 87 corners before scoring in the 43rd minute of the game. Amorim needs to address his side’s set piece frailties with 10 of the 29 goals they’ve conceded in the league coming from corners, which amounts to 34% of all of their goals conceded.\nClick for more latest Football news.

Su canción titulada La Víctima es la de mayor aceptación en 2023, pues logró aglutinar más de 149 millones de reproducciones en la plataforma.\nHasta el momento, Xavi y Bad Bunny son los únicos latinos que han logrado tener dos canciones al mismo tiempo en el top 10 de Spotify.\nRelacionados Los álbumes de 2023: De Olivia Rodrigo a Peso Pluma y los Rolling Stones Giras de Karol G, RBD y Luis Miguel entre las 20 más lucrativas a nivel mundial Taylor Swift es la artista más escuchada de Spotify en 2023, destrona a Bad Bunny Según recoge el portal El Imparcial , Xavi tiene fuertes influencias de la música regional mexicana pero con una mezcla de trap, rap y reguetón.\nSu carrera musical inició apenas hace tres años cuando, en la cocina de su casa, cogió una guitarra y comenzó a tocar la guitarra, cantar y compartir sus grabaciones a través de las redes sociales. Lo mismo cantaba un ‘narcocorrido’ que una balada romántica. En sus propias palabras, él se define como un “tumbado romántico”.\nLa mayoría de sus letras hablan de amor, desamor y experiencias personales.\nVale la pena destacar que la voz de Xavi, a diferencia de la de Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija –conocido artísticamente como Peso Pluma–, es más suave y melódica. Aunque no deja de ser considerada de tinte urbano.\nEn una entrevista concedida al presentador y productor musical, Pepe Garza, Xavi dijo que sus influencias musicales son Freddie Mercury , el fallecido vocalista de la banda Queen ; y uno de los máximos exponentes de los corridos tumbados, Natanel Cano, con quien espera colaborar pronto.\n“Nunca supe que quería hacer música hasta los 15”, dijo Xavi.\nRelacionados Los álbumes de los Beatles clasificados en orden de grandeza Fans indignados por el retraso del álbum ‘Vultures’ de Kanye West “Les digo adiós y gracias”: Ricardo Arjona se retira de los escenarios En esa misma intervención, Xavi dijo que compone canciones desde los 12 años; pero fue hasta los 15, cuando decidió abrirse camino en la industria musical de manera formal. Y agregó: “Creo que todos pueden componer; es como mostrar tu historia de vida, pero en una canción”.\nActualmente, Xavi cuenta con 18 millones de oyentes mensuales; mientras que su compatriota Peso Pluma suma más de 54 millones.\nLee más sobre América Latina Arizona música México Peso Pluma Queen Freddie Mercury Bad Bunny Spotify 1 /1 Xavi, el joven que está triunfando al ritmo de corridos tumbados Xavi, el joven que está triunfando al ritmo de corridos tumbados YouTube / PEPE GARZA\n✕ Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

    "title": "#9 Declaración Oficial de Irán: \"La entidad sionista y Estados Unidos deben ser castigados por genocidio en los tribunales internacionales\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nCuando un régimen como el de Irán te pinta la cara frente a todo el mundo es que la moralidad de tu país es un saco de mierda en el sótano del infierno, así, sin más. Y ya no engañas a nadie fuera de tus votantes más extremistas.\nMuchos deberían hacerse mirar a quién y qué cojones están apoyando y reflexionar en la intimidad de su dormitorio, en vez de ir negativizando noticias del Menéame y pidiendo que baneen a quienes denunciamos al Estado genocida, supremacista y expansionista de Israel.\nEstados Unidos e Israel quieren y necesitan la guerra. El mundo debe evitar entrar en la espiral belicista en que pretenden hacernos caer y que sólo les beneficia a ellos. La legalidad internacional, los bloqueos y las sanciones son el único camino, o se habrá caído en su trampa y ellos se legitimarán en la infinidad de medios y parlamentos que controlan.\nEl apartheid debe acabar de una vez por todas y para siempre. Los palestinos están en su tierra y son los ocupados, tienen derecho a defenderse, Israel es la potencia ocupante y carece de ese derecho. Son los palestinos los que tienen derecho a quedarse y luchar por ello.\nNo lo digo yo, lo dicen los tratados internacionales.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Tienes toda la razón, pero no se si van a quedar palestinos, no es apartheid es genocidio y no hay presión suficiente para pararlo. Ya hay más de 20,000 muertos palestinos, no sabemos cuántos mutilados, cuantos traumatizados de por vida y que viabilidad le queda a Palestina con un mundo que deja que Israel los destruya sin poner límite.\n[#6](c6#c-6) Tu afirmación parte de una falacia enorme. Los derechos humanos YA no valen nada. La única vía para implementarlos y estandarizarlos es que todo el mundo funcione bajo las mismas reglas, sin excepciones. Si no esos \"derechos\" son papel mojado.\nQue no hay que irse a China ni hostias, ¿los derechos humanos de Julian Assange dónde están?\n[#6](c6#c-6) cuanto valen los derechos humanos de un palestino masacrado entre cascotes?\nY la de 20.000 de ellos?",

    "text": "Ahora que llegamos al final de las navidades, conviene sacar a la luz el trabajo de muchas personas que tienen el principal objetivo de hacer sonreír a las personas de su entorno. Los profesionales de cocina del Hospital de Jaén han sido grandes protagonistas unas navidades más.115 pinches, 20 cocineros, 12 dietistas, dos jefes de cocina y una jefa de grupo de cocina han realizado otro esfuerzo para hacer más amenas estas fechas navideñas a los jiennenses ingresados durante estas jornadas. Debe ser triste afrontar una Navidad lejos de los seres queridos y con problemas de salud. Vivir unas navidades en el hospital es una de las sensaciones más complejas que muchas familias deben afrontar año tras año. Para ello, los profesionales de cocina del Hospital de Jaén se han puesto manos a la obra para ofrecer un menú especial para estas jornadas. Hay quien piensa que un plato de gambas o langostinos, una ración pavo al horno, o una panacotta de postre, no pueden ser servidos en un hospital. En Jaén se ha demostrado que sí es posible, y lo han permitido los profesionales de cocina, los cuales han diseñado estos menús especiales con mucho cariño. También, los trabajadores piden que el Hospital de Jaén, que es uno de los pocos de Andalucía que no ofrecen menú opcional durante el resto del año, pueda hacerlo en breve con un pequeña inversión. Por ese motivo, estos, a través de VIVA Jaén, piden que se haga un esfuerzo para poder ofrecer en futuras ocasiones una alternativa a los pacientes en fechas señaladas a lo largo del año. Ese esfuerzo tiene premio, y no es precisamente económico. La mayor de las recompensas se ha encontrado este año a través de unas notas escritas por los pacientes ingresados, que acabaron posteriormente en manos de los trabajadores. Ellos mismos se muestran emocionados por esa respuesta que han compartido, incluso, a través de sus perfiles de redes sociales. Llegan los— Maria ? (@caba_del) [#ReyesMagos] El mejor regalo para todo el equipo de nutrición, cocina y limpieza Los profesionales estamos muy satisfechos ?☕ [#FelizJueves]para todos nuestros pacientes [@HospitalJaen] [@lusfuentes4] [@germanzarzamore] [@MareaJaen] [pic.twitter.com/74O3vaMsaY] [January 5, 2024] Desde esta área del Hospital de Jaén reclaman mayor compromiso a la dirección con el fin de ofrecer un menú especial sin necesidad de realizar este esfuerzo por cuenta propia un año más. Los mismos trabajadores aseguran que “no se trata de un esfuerzo económico, sino de organización. Es el momento más agradable del paciente en todo el día y nosotros lucharemos por ello\". A pesar de ello, los trabajadores agradecen a sus pacientes que hayan reconocido su esfuerzo \"porque nos ayuda a seguir adelante\", aunque no quieren dejar pasar aquellas \"dificultades laborales diarias, como la falta de personal\".

    "text": "VANCOUVER - The first Arctic patrol vessel for Canada's Pacific fleet has officially been commissioned in a ceremony featuring Princess Anne, the sister of King Charles. She attended the event Friday in North Vancouver in her role as commodore-in-chief for the Canadian Fleet Pacific. The ceremony was limited to one media photographer and one video camera. The Department of National Defence said in a statement Friday that the official introduction of HMCS Max Bernays into the fleet included a \"symbolic presentation of the keys to the ship\" to the commanding officer, Commander Collin Forsberg, \"along with the breaking of the ship’s commissioning pennant, and three cheers by the ship's company.\" Forsberg told reporters ahead of the ceremony that the patrol vessel arrived in its new home port in Esquimalt last month. He said the ship was \"designed for, principally, exercising Canadian sovereignty in northern waters.\" He said the introduction of the ship, which was named after a Canadian naval hero in the Second World War, will allow the navy to better meet future defence challenges in the North. \"Just being here and doing our commissioning is amazing. It's been 2 1/2 years of very hard work for the crew of the HMCS Max Bernays,\" he said. Forsberg said the vessel has not yet conducted missions for government, but the new ship will likely start by doing three- to four-month missions. The ship, he said, was designed to travel through waters with ice that is about a metre thick. \"Having done the ice trials in the two predecessor ships to this, I know it can successfully do that and that's what makes us unique having the haul strength to go through Arctic ice.\" The HMCS Max Bernays was built by Irving Shipbuilding Inc. and launched in Atlantic waters on Oct. 23, 2021. Forsberg said the ship is fully staffed with 65 people, having spent the last nine months transitioning control of the ship to its West Coast staff. \"It's a very happy day for us but sort of a sad day as well because this is where, today, we say goodbye to our East Coast sailors,\" he said. Forsberg said it was \"extremely special\" to welcome Princess Anne to the ship for the ceremony. \"It's a huge honour to be welcomed into the fleet by Her Royal Highness,\" he said. \"It really hits home for the history of our ship.\" It is the first ship in the Harry DeWolf-class attached to the Pacific Fleet, although the HMCS Robert Hampton Gray is expected to become the second such vessel to make the transfer between coasts, the Defence Department said in a statement issued last month. During a media tour of the ship Friday, the ship's staff was seen preparing for Princess Anne's arrival. Among them was Lt. Cmdr. Clayton Erickson, who jumped in to help Lt. Alex Tremblay do his tie ahead of the ceremony. The tour also included a look into dining and living quarters, control rooms, sick bay, as well as the wardroom, or mess cabin, where the princess was scheduled to have dinner alongside the commander and others during her sail to Vancouver Island. The office of B.C.'s lieutenant-governor said last week that the princess and her husband, Vice-Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, would attend the commissioning, which would then be followed by an overnight sail to Esquimalt. It is among a series of events for the princess during her three-day trip to B.C., that started with the commissioning ceremony in North Vancouver. The princess's itinerary includes a visit to the archives and collections space of the Maritime Museum of B.C. in Victoria, which was founded with an initial donation by the princess's late father, Prince Philip. She is scheduled to attend a commemorative service marking the Battle of the Atlantic at the British Columbia legislature and lay a wreath, as well as visit the Military Family Resource Centre. Princess Anne is also slated to meet with Janet Austin, B.C.'s lieutenant-governor, and various community leaders from the province. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2024. Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said the ship was Canada's first Arctic and Offshore Patrol Vessel. In fact, it is the first such vessel to join the Pacific fleet.",
