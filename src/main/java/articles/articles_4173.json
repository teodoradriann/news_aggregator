    "text": "Former Hillsong Church global senior pastor Brian Houston said that his X (formerly Twitter) account was hacked after the comment “ladies and girls kissing” was\nposted late Tuesday evening (Feb. 20) at 11:48 pm.\nHouston’s odd post, which has since been deleted, caused many social media users that read his post to speculate that he had mistaken his X post for a Google search—implying that he might have been searching for sexual content.\nAt 11:57 pm, Houston posted, “I think my Twitter may have been hacked.” That post also has been deleted.\n“Don’t mix your Twitter with google searches,” one person replied, while another said, “[Some] one that hacked Brian Houston’s and then allowed him to recover it in 16 minutes.”\nRELATED:\nHot Mic Catches Bobbie Houston Telling Brian To ‘Hook’ Audience To Donate to New Online Church\nAlthough many of Houston’s critics weren’t buying his account being hacked claim, on Wednesday Houston shared a message from someone claiming to be his assistant, who reiterated that Hillsong Church’s former pastor’s X account was indeed hacked.\n“Thank you for your concern, Ps Brian’s assistant here! Rest assured we are working on discovering how Ps Brian was hacked,” Houston’s assistant\nwrote. “Our team has ascertained that someone logged into his account from a location within the USA. We’ve changed his password so here’s hoping they no longer have access.”\nHis assistant then said to ignore posts that appear to be “out of the normal” for the pastor and said that for “your safety remember Pastor Brian does not contact anyone privately.

    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel — A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz on Thursday announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.\nThe news came six days after Weinstein's husband, Gad Haggai, was also pronounced dead.\nWeinstein, 70, and Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.\nIn the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.\nWeinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Haggai was killed Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza.\nOn Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Weinstein was also killed on Oct. 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza.\nIt was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.\nThe couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbut said.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was ''devastated'' to learn of Weinstein's death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.\nThe families \"have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal,'' he said in a statement.\nWeinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.\n''Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,'' her family said in a statement.\nAl Haggai, one of the couple's sons, told Israel's Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother's multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children.\nHe said that when his mother's name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something happened to her.\nAccording to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.\nNir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on Oct. 7, with roughly one- quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.\nThe families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new cease-fire deal to bring home their loved-ones.\nNetanyahu met Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.\n''I can't elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,'' he said.",

    "title": "Oregon man who moved to Henderson sentenced for torturing, murdering monkeys",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — An Oregon man who moved to Henderson has been sentenced to federal prison after being convicted of torturing and murdering monkeys. Court documents state that from January 2022 to February 2023, 48-year-old David Christopher Noble conspired with others to send multiple online payments to people overseas to fund the production of videos depicting the torture, mutilation, and murder of monkeys. According to the Justice Department, in an online animal abuse group, Noble \"expressed his enjoyment of videos depicting the torture and murder of long-tailed macaques\" and that members of the group referred to them as \"rats\". In a message sent in June 2022, Noble wrote the only thing he did not like in abuse videos was when the torturers \"kill the rats too quickly\" and they should \"keep it alive, make it suffer, make sure it knows to fear you and that you end its existence at any time.\" In another message, Noble wrote \"the noises they make from pain and abuse are some of my favorite sounds.\" In February 2023, investigators searched Noble's home in Prineville, Oregon, which is about three hours southeast of Portland, and found approximately 50 videos depicting animal abuse, along with several firearms and ammunition. After his home was searched, Noble moved to Henderson. On May 18, 2023, a federal grand jury in Eugene, Oregon returned an indictment with Noble facing multiple charges. On June 13, 2023, he was arrested in Henderson and he was extradited back to Oregon. On January 10, 2024, Noble pleaded guilty to conspiring to engage in animal crushing and creating and distributing animal crush videos. In legal terms, the term \"animal crushing\" means actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury. On Thursday, Noble was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release. \"The victims in this case cannot speak for themselves, but the impact of the grotesque violence brought upon them is unmistakable. At the direction of David Noble and his co-conspirators, the producers of these animal abuse videos not only killed monkeys but did so in a way that extended their pain and suffering as long as possible,\" said Nathan J. Lichvarcik, Chief of the U.S. Attorney's Office Eugene and Medford Branch Offices. \"David Noble's depraved actions not only inflicted unspeakable agony upon innocent creatures but also tainted the very essence of humanity's moral fiber,\" said Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer. \"Under Noble's direction, the production and distribution of grotesque animal abuse videos represented a dark descent into the abyss of cruelty and exploitation.\"",

    "text": "A weather system moving into Southern California is expected to bring another lengthy heat wave and dry lightning to the region, increasing fire danger and prompting the National Weather Service to issue fire-danger warnings in several counties Aug. 1. The weather service issued a red-flag warning, specifically for increased risk of fire, Thursday for Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, and the Santa Clarita Valley. A series of thunderstorms were expected to bring rain to the area through Saturday. Some of the thunderstorms were not expected to produce rain, making the lightning strikes more capable of igniting fires, the weather service reported. “Considering the recent extended heat waves and rapidly drying fuels, a significant fire-weather risk will exist,” the weather service said in the warning. The state’s largest fire, named the Park fire in Butte and Tehama counties, which has burned 614 square miles—nearly 150 square miles larger than the City of Los Angeles—was 18 percent contained Thursday. The fire remained mostly active in the northeast section of Tehama County. “Today will mark the first of several days where fire weather will become increasingly critical,” Cal Fire wrote in an update Thursday. Temperatures in the area were expected to rise from the upper 90s to the low 100s. Daytime humidity was also expected to fall to the upper teens Thursday. A heat dome predicted to enter the area Friday and linger into Saturday could bring thunderstorms and erratic winds to the fire region, according to Cal Fire. In the Lassen National Forest, located just east of the fire, winds were expected to increase Thursday ahead of the forecasted thunderstorms. [closed](https://www.nps.gov/lavo/index.htm)Thursday due to the fire. The fire has destroyed 485 homes and buildings and damaged 47 other structures as of Thursday afternoon. Further south, the Nixon fire in Riverside County had grown to just over eight square miles by Thursday morning, according to Cal Fire. The fire, which is 14 percent contained, did not grow overnight and was burning mostly interior pockets of dried vegetation, authorities said. “Moisture will increase through Friday as monsoonal flows develop over the fire area, with a chance of producing thunderstorms and lightning,” Cal Fire wrote in a morning update Thursday. “Firefighters will remain engaged to ensure the fire remains within its perimeter.” Several evacuation orders and warnings remained in place Thursday in Riverside and San Diego counties.",

    "text": "La Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua) informó que la temporada de sequía en México ya comenzó y se espera que se extienda hasta mediados de mayo de 2025.\nEn una conferencia virtual, Fabián Vázquez Romaña, director del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN), entidad adscrita a la Conagua, explicó que enero y febrero serán los meses más críticos, con una notable falta de lluvias. \"La temporada de estiaje inicia en noviembre y termina en mayo\", afirmó, aunque agregó que podrían registrarse lluvias durante el invierno, principalmente asociadas a los frentes fríos.\nVázquez señaló que las precipitaciones de enero y febrero estarán \"por debajo de la media\", es decir, serán menores a las registradas en años anteriores. Esta disminución podría agravar la sequía que afectará al país durante este periodo. La temporada de lluvias está prevista para comenzar en la segunda quincena de mayo.\nTe podría interesar\nSobre el ciclo de lluvias que recién terminó, el SMN destacó que el 30% del territorio nacional mostró cierta recuperación en sus reservas de agua, gracias a las precipitaciones provocadas por sistemas ciclónicos. Sin embargo, mientras que el centro y sur de México presentan condiciones relativamente estables, el norte del país sigue enfrentando una severa sequía.\nCrisis climática hará más cálida la temporada invernal en el Valle de México: CAMe\nEn la actual temporada invernal 2024-2025 se esperan dos contingencias ambientales por contaminación de partículas, principalmente debido a la quema de pirotecnia el 24 y 25 de diciembre y el 31 de diciembre y el 1 de enero, informó este miércoles la Comisión Ambiental de la Megalópolis (CAMe)\nEn conferencia de prensa, las autoridades de la CAMe también apuntaron que en este 2024 \"debido a las fuertes olas de calor\" se registraron 12 contingencias ambientales, 11 por ozono y una por partículas.\nAdemás, se apuntó que producto de la crisis climática, la temporada invernal para los estados que integran la megalópolis será más cálida, ya que se espera que las temperaturas mínimas sean 3 o 4 grados más altas de lo normal.\nLa zona metropolitana del Valle de México (ZMVM) está compuesta por la Ciudad de México y 60 municipios del Estado de México e Hidalgo, que en conjunto forman la llamada megalópolis.\n\"Para los próximos tres meses se ven condiciones anormalmente cálidas sobre todo las temperaturas mínimas, es decir, las temperaturas de la madrugada serán por arriba de lo normal, es lo que tenemos previsto tanto para enero, febrero y marzo\", indicó el coordinador del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional.\nExpuso que tanto las temperaturas mínimas como las máximas han estado por arriba del promedio en lo que va del año y señaló que en algunas zonas, como en Hidalgo, las temperaturas han estado hasta 5 grados Celsius por arriba del promedio.\nCon información de EFE.",

    "title": "The Church of Jesus Christ breaks ground on Teton River Idaho Temple",
    "text": "Today, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints broke ground for the Teton River Idaho Temple in Rexburg. Elder Ricardo P. Gimenéz presided at the ceremony and gave the dedicatory prayer. In his talk, Elder Gimenéz said it's important to remember the purpose of the groundbreaking is because of Jesus Christ. \"The House of the Lord, it's a holy place, and we have an opportunity to be inside,\" Elder Gimenéz said. \"But our lives go beyond that. The things that we need to do and the invitation to 'stand in holy places and be not moved,' includes everything that we do in life with the focus on the Savior.\" In his dedicatory prayer, Elder Gimenéz expressed gratitude for the Savior, for the temple, for scriptures and for continuing revelation. He asked God to bless and protect the ground and those who will work to build the temple. \"Bless each of these men and women with spiritual gifts and additional capacity for the task before them,\" he said. \"We pray that all who labor on this project will feel the importance of this sacred edifice. And we pray that thou wilt frustrate the efforts of any who might approach this site with unholy intentions.\" In an interview with BYU-Idaho Radio, Elder Gimenéz said it's important for people in the area to prepare to worship in the temple and not just serve in or attend the temple. \"I think that's a key preparation,\" Elder Gimenéz said. \"Changing our mindset, why are we in the temple? What are we doing there?\" The ceremony included multiple speakers including Trixie Smith, a youth speaker from the Terreton Idaho Stake, Rebekah Russell, a BYU-Idaho student from the Rexburg Idaho Young Single Adult 1st Stake and Brent Kinghorn from the Sugar City Idaho Stake. Kinghorn also served in the first Rexburg Idaho Temple presidency. He noted that the new temple's name is appropriate because it sits \"on an island\" between two forks of the Teton River. He said it's 1 1/2 miles to each fork. He wondered if the Teton Dam flood, which happened on June 5, 1976, helped clean the area and prepare it for a future temple, \"and that the work here, that will be accomplished, can do so because of the cleanliness and beauty of this place.\" Smith said the purpose of her talk was to help encourage people to attend the temple more often. \"We should have a strong desire to enter the temple often because it is in that building we have the opportunity to receive personal revelation and feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ,\" Smith said. Russell is in her final semester at BYU-Idaho and spoke about a \"determination bent on permanency,\" a phrase she found while reading about the founding of Rexburg in the 1800s. \"I repeat, the House of the Lord is where things are made permanent,\" she said. \"This is where husband and wife are joined together. This is where families can be together forever. This is where we link ourselves and our loved ones to God in an unbroken chain permanently tied to Him where we can one day return to our heavenly home, permanently.\" Russell told BYU-Idaho Radio she was a little nervous about speaking at the groundbreaking until she realized something important. \"This is awesome. I love all these people and we all have a common goal. I don't really need to be nervous it's just a place where the Spirit can be and I can help facilitate that,\" Russell said. Several local and state government officials were in attendance including Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke, State Sen. Doug Ricks, State Reps. Britt Raybould and Jon Weber, Sugar City Mayor Steve Adams and Rexburg Mayor Jerry Merrill, among others. Mayor Merrill is excited to have a second temple in Rexburg, one of only a couple of cities in the world to have two temples of the Church of Jesus Christ within the city limits. He says the city has helped prepare for the new temple to come to Rexburg and is planning for more development on that side of town, including more roads in the future. \"We anticipate that there will be a lot of development out here on this end of the city,\" Mayor Merrill said. The mayor is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and looks forward to the positive influence the temple will have on the people of Rexburg and those in the surrounding area. \"Just to be able to have the influence of the temple here and the good things that it brings to a community, it's really exciting,\" he said. Church President Russell M. Nelson originally announced the temple in Oct. 2021. The temple is expected to be about 100,000 square feet. It will sit about 3.4 miles away from the Rexburg Idaho Temple on the same road, 2nd East. Idaho is home to eight other temples of the Church including the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple, the Boise Idaho Temple, The Rexburg Idaho Temple, the Twin Falls Idaho Temple, the Meridian Idaho Temple, the Pocatello Idaho Temple, the Burley Idaho Temple, which is under construction, and the Montpelier Idaho Temple, which is also under construction. The Gem State has more than 470,000 members of the Church.",

La polémique est née suite à des propos « condamnables » tenus dans le groupe WhatsApp du collectif. Pour l’heure, il a décidé de quitter la commune.\nIl n’a pas jugé prudent de rebrousser chemin pour passer les fêtes chez lui.\nPierre-Louis Brière, 25 ans, domicilié à Magny-les-Hameaux (Yvelines), une commune de 10 000 habitants, a fait ses valises avec femme et enfants dans la nuit du 8 au 9 décembre. Il est, depuis, hébergé chez des proches. Début décembre, il aurait reçu des menaces de mort par téléphone, une dizaine, selon lui. Les propos qu’il rapporte sont sans équivoque : « On va vous massacrer un par un », « On a votre adresse », « On vous croise tous les jours dans la rue et pour l’instant on vous sourit mais… »\nLa suite après cette publicité\nL’avalanche trouve sa source dans un tract lié au projet de mosquée porté par l’Association des musulmans de Magny (A2MH).
