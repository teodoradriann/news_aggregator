    "title": "What is the next course of action for Gen Zs after euphoric victory - The Standard",
    "text": "After a euphoric week of dictating the government’s agenda, thousands of young Kenyans who took to the street to oppose the punitive taxes were on Thursday unsure of the next course of action. Generation Z (Gen Z) were undecided whether to revel in their biggest triumph yet of forcing President William Ruto to [publicly disown](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001497718/ruto-forced-to-eat-humble-pie-as-gen-z-protests-escalate) the Finance Bill he had so actively campaigned for or to press on and try to force the administration out of power. Using the X platform, participants spent hours arguing over the Road to Statehouse protests, a scenario that escalated to the formation of splinter groups amongst them. The exchange of views on different X Spaces came after President Ruto in his address to the nation, gave in to pressure and refused to assent to the Finance Bill, 2024. According to their itinerary, they were to proceed with the protests Thursday in a bid to occupy State House and demand President William Ruto to resign. However, one side of the faction of which Hanifa Adan was part of, advised against the “ill move’’ since it would result to bloodshed and loss of lives as witnessed during earlier protests. “Like we said, this has no leaders and everyone is deciding for themselves but I’m against marching to State House, we have lost a lot of people, can we honour them first?” she posted on X. Khalif Kairo, an entrepreneur who is vocal on the platform and was instrumental during the protests, urged the youth to take the President Ruto decision to withdraw the controversial bill as a win for them, and going forward, he urged them to consider Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s call for dialogue. “I feel like we have had a very big win. We should give dialogue a chance while allowing the President to act on our grievances,” he said. Meanwhile, a faction of Gen Z still determined to continue with the protests, accused some of them being paid to betray their cause. This group viewed the President’s move to [withdraw the Bill](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001497974/house-to-consider-rutos-memo-after-recess-speaker-says) as too little too late and advocated for his removal. In a bid to convince everyone to hit the streets for the anti-government protests, some X Spaces participants pointed out the atrocities meted by police officers on peaceful and unarmed young Kenyans whose mistakes they say, was to ask the President why the political class was increasingly getting wealthier at the expense of the taxpayers. However, in their unity of purpose, a total of 31,070 people contributed Sh22.11million in support of the victims of violence meted on them during the process. The funds raised through a mobile money platform are expected to be used to clear hospital bills for those injured during the protests and for funeral arrangements for the fallen comrades. “The money is for burials and hospital bills. After paying the bills, the families will get the money too,” Adan posted. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter",

    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy Bobbie Jean Carter, 41, was discovered [dead](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/death) in the bathroom of her Florida home over the weekend. The sister of Nick and [Aaron Carter](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/celebrities) was found on Saturday, but new details are emerging regarding the manner of her death. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office told [TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/27/nick-aaron-carter-sister-bobbie-jean-carter-found-unresponsive-bathroom-dead-dies/) that first responders were dispatched to Bobbie’s Tampa residence on Saturday morning. “On December 23, 2023, Hillsborough County Fire rescue crews arrived at the home located… in Tampa, and they discovered a woman who later was identified as Bobbie Jean Carter,” a statement from the sheriff’s office said, per [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bobbie-jean-carter-nick-aaron-carters-sister-dead-bathroom). “She was immediately transported to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Tampa, where she was declared dead by hospital medical staff at 8:02 a.m.” The outlet noted that Carter was on probation for [cocaine possession](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/drugs), but her roommate insisted that “she had not used any narcotics since her release from prison.” “No narcotics or personal paraphernalia were located in Ms. Carter’s room or bathroom. Deputies observed no signs of foul play,” the document stated. Deputies stayed with Carter’s 8-year-old daughter until relatives arrived, the outlet said. Bobbie Jean’s death is very similar to that of her brother, Aaron Carter, who was found dead in his bathtub in November 2022. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed in April that the 34-year-old singer died from drowning after taking pills and huffing spray paint, as The Daily Wire previously [reported](https://www.dailywire.com/news/medical-examiners-release-official-cause-of-death-for-singer-aaron-carter). The report noted that Aaron’s cause of death was “due to the effects of difluoroethane (aerosol propellant found in spray cans) and alprazolam (commonly referred to as Xanax).” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) Aaron’s mother Jane Schneck blamed authorities for not investigating Carter’s death as a potential crime. She tried to raise public interest by publishing [graphic images](https://www.dailywire.com/news/aaron-carters-mom-releases-graphic-photos-of-his-death-scene-in-plea-for-police-assistance-we-want-answers) of her son’s death scene on her Facebook page, insisting that foul play was likely. “Aaron had a lot of death threats and many, many people who were making his life miserable,” the singer’s mother said at the time. Both Bobbie Jean and Aaron were siblings to Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter. Their sister, Leslie Carter, [died in 2012](https://people.com/celebrity/leslie-carter-aaron-carters-sister-was-depressed-on-drugs/) at the age of 25 after going to sleep following a fall in the shower. Her death was also found to be drug related following years of substance abuse issues and depression, per People.",
