    "title": "\"Court has taught a lesson to BJP government\" says AAP after Kejriwal gets interim bail in ED Case on liquor scam",
    "text": "New Delhi [India], July 12 (ANI): The Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the now scrapped excise policy case registered by the Enforcement Directorate today (ED). The Delhi CM however will continue to remain in jail as he was arrested by the CBI in the same case.\nThe AAP celebrated the bail order saying that if the centre acts arbitrarily its pride would be shattered.\nSaurabh Bhardwaj, Minister of Health, Urban Development, Tourism, Art and Culture, took to his social media handle on platform X and posted \"First, Judge Nyay Bindu granted bail in the ED case, and now the country's biggest court has granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal .\" Further, he added, \"The court has taught a big lesson to the Central BJP government. If the centre still acts, arbitrarily, the pride will be further shattered.\"\nDelhi Minister Atishi said, \"...BJP knew that he ( Arvind Kejriwal ) has been granted bail by the Rouse Avenue Court, they know that he will get bail by the Supreme Court too. That is why, they hatched another conspiracy and the day on which the bail hearing was scheduled to come up before the Supreme Court, they made CBI arrest Arvind Kejriwal a day before that. Why was he arrested by the CBI? Because if he received bail in the ED case, he would come out of jail and work for the people of Delhi 10 times faster... I would like to tell the BJP today, one after the other - every court in this country has exposed your conspiracy... every court is granting bail to Arvind Kejriwal . I would like to tell the BJP, end your arrogance and stop hatching conspiracy against other parties. Truth can be troubled but not defeated...\"\nHowever, the BJP hit out at the AAP saying interim bail was not a relief from the crime committed.\nBJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat said, \"Interim Bail is not a relief from the crime that one has committed. Interim Bail provides for one to stay out of jail as the case proceeds. But it doesn't mean that Arvind Kejriwal has not done a scam, that he was not involved in corruption... Perhaps the Supreme Court has allowed him to be out and work as the people of Delhi are suffering. But the court has not acquitted him.\"\nEarlier, Senior Advocate Abhishek Singhvi also took to social media platform X and wrote \"After Kejriwal's CBI arrest, I called it \"insurance arrest,\" that is, knowing our arguments and weaknesses of theirs, the government apprehended adverse order. Hence, the CBI arrested AK after one full year, after interrogating him one year ago and while he was in ED custody.\nA bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna referred Kejriwal's petition challenging his arrest by the ED to a larger bench. The Supreme Court, while granting interim bail to Kejriwal in the ED case, observed that the Delhi CM has suffered incarceration of 90 days and that it's conscious that he is an elected leader.\nKejriwal's lawyer, Rishikesh Kumar, described the verdict as a \"big victory.\".\n'The Supreme Court has granted him interim bail and the issue of Section 19 and the necessity of arrest have been referred to a larger bench. CM Kejriwal will remain in custody as his bail in the CBI case is still pending. This is a big victory,\" Kumar told ANI.\nAdditionally, SC lawyer Shadan Farsat, representing Kejriwal, also said, \"The court observed that so far as his arrest is concerned, there are certain aspects of the necessity of the arrest. They said Mr Kejriwal has already undergone a large period of incarceration already and therefore, directed his release and bail immediately in the ED matter.\"\nThe top court had reserved the verdict on Kejriwal's plea on May 17.

She was one of 36 referees announced by the league Thursday as its referee selections for Round 1 of the playoffs starting this weekend.\n“It’s surreal,” Moyer-Gleich said. “It really is.”\nShe joins Violet Palmer as the only women picked by the NBA for a playoff assignment. Palmer worked nine playoff games between 2006 and 2012.\nMoyer-Gleich, a former Division II player at Millersville University in her native Pennsylvania, was promoted to the full-time NBA officiating ranks in November 2018. She’s worked more than 200 regular season games in her six seasons and is one of three first-time playoff selections by the league this year — Marat Kogut and J.T. Orr are the others.\n“I worked four games as an alternate last year, so obviously, my goal was I wanted to be an alternate again because that’s just sustaining the growth that I’ve had in my career,” Moyer-Gleich said. “And then to see my name on list of working floor officials … I mean, my mom was with me, she came with me on my last two games for a little trip, and to open that email and have her there with me and share that news, it was really quite amazing.”",

    "text": "Rochester teen sees success with snow removal business ROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) – As the area’s first major snowstorm hit the area, and one young Rochester entrepreneur is happy to see the snow coming down. In 2022, when Adam Gyura was a Junior in high school, he started his own lawn care and snow removal business, with the goal of making money to use for college. “I figured I had to make money somehow, and I wanted to be my own boss,” Gyura said. His business is called 2 Seasons Lawn & Property Care and for the last few months, he’s been preparing for the first snow of the season. “I have been to Fleet Farm nearly every week, getting salt, getting gas. Just getting ready.” Now 18, Gyura’s business has taken off, with more than 50 customers. On Friday, he got a head start with snow removal. With the help of his cousin, he planned on clearing 14 houses throughout the night. But he said Saturday will be when the work really starts, when he will be clearing 34 houses. “We will be all day and night working, it will be rough, but we’re ready,” he said. He said his dad an entrepreneur, too he’s helped him a lot with getting the business started. “I don’t think it’s anything too special. I like being my own boss. Doing my own thing. Just advocating and working for myself. I just really enjoy it. Some people don’t some people do. But yeah, I just like trying to inspire my brothers.” He said if someone has been considering starting a business, it takes a lot of hard work, but it pays off in the end. “If you want to start your own business, just go and do it,” he said. “I started out going door to door knocking. It deters you a little bit, but sooner or later, you get a person, then another person and another. Next thing you know, you’re hauling around snowblowers and a truck.” Gyura said he’s completely booked for the winter but has opening for customers for spring and summer.

Article information\nAuthor, Editorial Role, BBC News World 7 julio 2024\nThe results of the parliamentary elections in France brought joy to thousands of people who had taken to the streets to wait for their compatriots to finish casting their votes.\nFollowing the historic advance of the far-right National Rally party during the first round, analysts were pointing out that this party led by Marine Le Pen was on the verge of governing.\nBut the strategy of several centrist and left-wing candidates to drop out of the race in order to consolidate the vote turned the results around, and the left-wing alliance New Popular Front led the vote.\nCelebrations – and long faces – in the face of the result were the main features of the day.\nPhoto caption: The Place de la République in Paris was the place chosen by thousands of people to celebrate this Sunday.\nImage source, EPA\nCaption: Many people gathered to watch the election results together, given the importance of the vote for France.\nImage source, Reuters\nPhoto caption: The celebrations were particularly massive in Paris, where citizens carried slogans with the French triptych “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.”\nImage source, EPA\nPhoto caption: At the protests, signs could be read with phrases such as “the extreme right will not pass.”\nImage source, EPA\nCaption: Celebrations spread across different parts of the country: in Marseille, in the south of France, citizens declared “Marseille, proud and popular citizen”.\nImage source, EPA\nCaption: After celebrating the results of the first round, supporters of Le Pen and the National Rally party were shocked to see their victory crumble.\nImage source, EPA\nPhoto caption: The atmosphere was gloomy at the headquarters of the National Group.
