    "text": "Britain has conducted new trials of the DragonFire long-range directed energy laser weapon, successfully targeting multiple aerial objects, the UK Ministry of Defence reported on Friday. As reported by The Times, the system, positioned at different locations and at a distance of several kilometers, destroyed approaching drones. “During tests at the military range on the Hebrides, the DragonFire directed energy laser weapon system successfully carried out the UK’s first powerful laser firing at aerial targets,” the ministry’s statement, published on the government’s website, said. The range of DragonFire is classified, but the ministry stated that the system is a line-of-sight weapon capable of striking “any visible target.” This stage of testing demonstrated DragonFire’s ability to engage aerial targets at relevant distances, marking a significant step toward the adoption of this technology for military use. The British Army and Royal Navy are considering deploying this weapon within their air defense capabilities, according to the statement. Grant Shapps, the head of the UK Ministry of Defence, stated that such advanced weaponry could “radically alter the battlefield” by reducing dependence on costly ammunition and minimizing collateral damage. As indicated by the defense ministry, the cost of firing one shot from the laser weapon typically amounts to less than £10, while generating as much heat in 10 seconds as a conventional heater would in an hour of use.",

    "text": "\"I walk on the bus and everyone looks at me.” Some Cornell students who wear the hijab say their religion has made them a target This story contains references to sexual assault, violence against women, Islamophobic and antisemitic harassment. When Laila Salih was preparing to move from Washington state to New York to attend Cornell, her father, like most dads, was worried about his daughter’s safety. But he had a particular concern: Salih wears the hijab, a religious head covering worn by some Muslim women. “I cannot in good faith send you to the other side of the country and know that you will be targeted,” Salih recalled her father saying. Her father feared the hijab would make Salih a target for Islamophobia. So he asked her to stop wearing it. And she did, until the beginning of this year’s fall semester when she said she felt the hijab was finally accepted and even celebrated by non-Muslims. “We're kind of moving forward past the [9/11 hatred and Islamophobia](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1036217570?ft=nprml&f=1036217570). And I was like, okay, cool. So, I put it back on.” But she said after the [October 7th](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/09/1236537541/israel-five-months-hamas-war) attack on Israel, things changed. “I 100% felt the shift in energy when I stepped outside of my door that day,” Salih said. “It went from people not paying any mind to me or really caring to I walk on the bus and everyone looks at me.” Since then Salih says she’s felt like all eyes are on her. In November, she and some friends were filmed leaving Friday prayer services by a person she says had been seen filming pro-Palestinian protesters at rallies on campus. She immediately worried that the video would be used to dox her. Doxing, when a person's face, address or other personal information is shared online, has happened to some [pro-Palestinian activists.](https://whyy.org/articles/harassment-hate-crimes-spike-conflict-israel-gaza-new-jersey-philadelphia/) Salih feared that her name was going to be attached to hatred and bigotry that she did not abide by. “Potentially not being able to go to a medical school because they searched up my name and the first thing they find is, oh, she's an antisemite,” she said. “When I was just walking out of Friday prayer.” Salih reported the incident to university police but she said she was not informed of further investigation. The lack of response left her feeling uncertain as to whether she should have reported the incident in the first place. “That's why I think it's so important that the university acknowledges things like this,” Salih said. “Because when they don't, students start to feel like it's not as big of a deal as it actually should be.” Vice President for University Relations Joel Malina told WSKG that the university takes all complaints of harassment seriously and does not tolerate Islamophobia. [Harassment and violence](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/30/1209529125/threats-against-palestinian-muslim-and-jewish-people-has-spiked-since-the-war-be) against Muslim, Jewish and Arab people has gotten worse since the war started. For Muslim women like Salih who wear the hijab, the visibility of their religious expression can make them a target. ‘Religion tattooed on your forehead’ Salih’s face never showed up online, but that feeling of being closely observed hasn’t gone away. This spring she took on the role of president of Cornell’s Muslim Educational and Cultural Association. She said she has heard from other women who wear the hijab who feel the same way One of them is Maryam, a freshman at Cornell who started wearing the hijab this school year. Maryam chose not to publicly reveal her last name because of safety concerns. One day in April, she was walking through Collegetown, a neighborhood just off campus that is largely populated by students. She was headed back from class with headphones on when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a man running towards her on the sidewalk. “Then suddenly, my face was wet. My whole face was wet. My glasses were covered. I couldn’t see,” Maryam said. The man had spit on her. As he fled the scene, he ran into her shoulder, pushing her. Maryam filed a police report and contacted the university. When she told her parents about the attack, her father insisted she transfer out of Cornell. “My dad was genuinely saying, I will pull you out of that school myself,” she recounted. Maryam said, despite the incident, she loves Cornell and wants to stay. University president Martha Pollack released a [statement](https://statements.cornell.edu/2024/20240319-incident-in-collegetown.cfm) that week, calling the incident “Islamophobic.” A former Cornell master’s student, Salim Dridi was later [charged with harassment](https://statements.cornell.edu/2024/20240419-incident.cfm), accused of spitting on Maryam. Police say they cannot confirm a motive for Dridi’s actions. Maryam said she has been consistently disappointed with the university’s response to Islamophobia on campus since the war began. “The administration had to wait until someone was physically assaulted for them to make a statement on Islamophobia on its own,” she said. [Arab and Muslim students](https://cornellsun.com/2023/11/28/pro-palestinian-advocates-condemn-university-silence-on-safety-concerns-ties-to-israel/) have [previously said](https://www.wskg.org/news/2024-02-09/cornell-students-protest-war-in-gaza) the university has not done enough to protect them from harassment. In public statements, Cornell officials publicly said that Maryam was a Muslim student and a woman but they never mentioned that she wore the hijab. Maryam said that information would have been useful to other Muslim women on campus. “It's really difficult to walk around with your religion tattooed on your forehead like that,” she said. “Especially in the wake of such political turmoil where your religion has been associated with terrorism.” Consequences of Visibility In the two weeks after the war in Gaza began, advocacy groups reported spikes in harassment against Jewish and Muslim Americans. The [Anti-Defamation League reported 312 antisemitic incidents.](https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-records-dramatic-increase-us-antisemitic-incidents-following-oct-7) [The Council for American Islamic Relations](https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-reports-sharp-increase-in-complaints-reported-bias-incidents-since-107/) also reported 774 Islamophobic bias incidents in that time period. Last fall, a [Cornell student was arrested and charged](https://www.wskg.org/news/2024-04-10/former-cornell-student-who-made-violent-threats-to-jewish-campus-community-pleads-guilty-in-federal-court) with making [violent online threats](https://cornellsun.com/2023/10/29/posts-online-threaten-jewish-students-and-center-for-jewish-living/) against Jewish people on a website called Greekrank. Those included rape threats against Jewish women. Another post on the same site targeted Muslim women. It suggested people should bring guns and “slave women in hijab” to Cornell parties. Since women who wear the hijab are more easily identified as Muslim, they can become targets for outside resentments and stereotypes about Islam, according to Dr. Nura Sediqe, a public policy professor at Michigan State University who focuses on the Muslim American community. “Muslim women often tend to be the frontline public image for debates, even if the debate isn't about them,” Sediqe said. Sediqe said that feelings about Israel and Palestine are being attached to women who wear the hijab. That’s something that Sediqe, who also wears the hijab, has experienced personally. While walking in the city, she said someone went out of their way to shout “Free Palestine” at her. “Well, how do you know I want to free Palestine? You assumed I do,” she said. “I do. But also you just assumed it because you saw me wearing a hijab.” Sediqe also said women who have been harassed often second-guess their experiences, fearing mislabeling an event as discrimination. “When people experience discrimination, they internalize shame, and then they don't report it.” She said the best practice for addressing gendered religious harassment against Muslims starts with directly involving women who wear the hijab, talking to them rather than about them. “Enabling the agency of Muslim women themselves to have a voice for themselves in these conversations is vital,” Sediqe said. Laila Salih, the student who was filmed leaving Friday prayers, said something as simple as empathy would go a long way for her. “Be aware and mindful that the person sitting next to you on the bus could be directly impacted by what's going on.” If you have experienced harassment based on your religion and gender and want to share your story, you can reach out to aberry@wskg.org.",

    "text": "Franciscan Fr. Daniel Horan quit Twitter after receiving pushback on a pro-transgender tweet, he wrote for the National Catholic Reporter (NCR).\nHoran tweeted Dec. 22 “Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Nonbinary people are people.” He wrote for the National Catholic Reporter that he meant the tweet as a “transgender-affirming post” in a time he says is particularly hateful toward transgender people. However, the backlash against the tweet ultimately drove Horan to delete his account.\nFr. Dan Horan posted that men are women & women are men in opposition to Pope Francis, the place he teaches, & the truth.\nHe could not handle criticism of such untruth.\nNow, he tries to give a noble justification of him leaving Twitter. https://t.co/7xWbvc5ERK pic.twitter.com/unPSj6ZRoS\n— Fr Matthew P. Schneider, LC (@FrMatthewLC) December 28, 2023\nHoran implicated Elon Musk for the vitriol against his pro-transgender tweet, claiming he has transformed Twitter into an anti-LGBT social media platform, including changing conduct policies to allow for such speech.\nHoran’s tweet was counter to Pope Francis’ remarks about gender ideology and transgenderism. The Pope has called gender ideology “dangerous” and maintained that marriage is between one man and one woman. (RELATED: Trans Actor Melts Down After Being ‘Misgendered’ At Delta Air Lines Gate)\nThe response to Horan was decidedly against the pro-transgender tweet.\nA priest tweeted , “He could not handle criticism of such untruth,” while another user expressed Horan needed to go back to “biology class.” The negative response to his tweet incited Horan to call Twitter “a space … designed to … encourage violence.”\nHoran has previously written articles for NCR supporting left-wing causes such as climate change ideology, the “ devolvement ” of Twitter after being bought by Elon Musk and anti-racism .\nHoran’s tweet emerged after Saint Mary’s College in Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic school, reversed its previous decision Dec. 21 to allow transgender women to enroll. Horan, a director and faculty member of the school, opposed the school’s decision.",

    "title": "Víctor ‘Chino’ Rivera, el DT campeón, formador y ‘padre’ de estrellas de Perú, confía en Christian Cueva, sueña con emigrar y confesó ser músico y bajista",
    "text": "Lleva más de dos décadas detrás de un buzo, formando a jugadores que tienen un nombre ganado a nivel nacional e internacional. el técnico Víctor Rivera dirigió a doce equipos, incluyendo a la selección peruana sub 20, ha sido influente en la carrera de muchos futbolistas que inclusive, alguno de ellos hasta hoy, lo consideran como un padre. El mediocampista Christian Cueva es uno de ellos, el entrenador lamentó el mal momento futbolístico que está viviendo uno de sus mejores pupilos, pero está seguro que recuperará el nivel que todos aplaudían.\nEl ‘Chino’ ya perdió la cuenta de cuántos jugadores hizo debutar, pero guarda en su memoria cada momento. Se confesó con Infobae Perú y recordó cómo llenó de confianza al referente de la ‘bicolor’, Luis Advíncula, cuando era pequeño y se muestra orgulloso de verlo triunfar en Boca Juniors. A pesar de toda la experiencia y logros que alcanzó, tiene un deseo más por cumplir: dirigir en el exterior.\nDespués de tener una pausa en la dirección técnica, Rivera se hará cargo de un equipo emblemático del Perú: Deportivo Municipal. El multicampeón con la Universidad San Martín volvió al mando de los ‘ediles’ después cuatro años y tendrá la misión de regresarlo a primera división. En su momento fue comentarista deportivo y reveló que su otra pasión es la música, toca y canta cuando se lo piden.\n- ¿Qué le motivó regresar a Deportivo Municipal?\nSiempre dirigir a un equipo con tanta tradición siempre motiva, aparte que soy una persona bastante identificada con Deportivo Municipal. Cuando me hicieron el ofrecimiento, me movió emocionalmente poder asumir el reto porque es un club al cual quiero mucho, estoy identificado con su historia con su tradición; esas son las razones por las que he decidido asumir el desafío de dirigir a Municipal.\n- Lo presentaron como técnico para la Liga 1...\nCuando me contrataron me dijeron que el equipo estaba esperando una resolución para jugar la Liga 1, y dentro del contrato también especificaron, estuvo de acuerdo, que si se jugaba la Liga 2 firmábamos una adenda y así ha sido. No cambia en nada porque yo soy entrenador de fútbol y más allá de dirigir la Liga 1 o 2, a mí me gusta ejercer mi profesión.\n- ¿Cómo encontró al equipo deportivamente considerando que varios jugadores se fueron?\nHay jugadores de 18 y 21 años, unos más que tienen contrato como Jair Céspedes, Antonio Yáñez y Aarom Fuentes. Hay un grupo que se ha quedado y ahora necesitamos conocer las reglas de la Liga 2 para poder armar nuestro equipo y ver algunas contrataciones.\n- ¿Qué piensa del momento de Christian Cueva: lesionado y sin equipo?\nTiene que recuperarse de la lesión y una vez que él se recupere, va a ser un jugador que dará mucho al equipo que lo contrate. Recuperado volverá a ser considerado dentro del universo de jugadores de la selección. Estoy seguro de que Christian está viendo algunas alternativas en el extranjero.\n- ¿Christian Cueva es el mejor jugador que dirigió?\nHay varios jugadores que he tenido la suerte de formar, es un gran número como Carlos Lobatón, José Moisela, Irven Ávila, Christian Cueva, Adrián Ascues, Pedro Gallese, Luis Advíncula, son tantos en realidad. Uno se siente contento con el crecimiento de todos, incluso de los jugadores que no llegan a jugar fútbol profesional. La intención es que sean buenas personas y buenos profesionales, me alegra que todos estén bien, gracias a Dios.\n- Luis Advíncula lo considera como un padre ¿Qué siente al verlo triunfar en Boca Juniors?\nFue una visión profesional de creer en él en Sporting Cristal, apoyarlo en toda su carrera. Fue algo que uno pudo aportar, él es una persona muy agradecida y lo sabe reconocer. Uno lo valora mucho. Cuando estuvo en Sporting Cristal fue titular en todos los partidos porque aposté por él desde el primer minuto. Veía en él mucha potencia, desde lo físico, el arranque, la velocidad, le vía muchas cualidades. El tiempo me dio la razón, y el resto fue por su esfuerzo, talento y sus ganas.\n- ¿A qué jugador le hubiese gustado dirigir?\nSi retrocedemos el tiempo, me hubiese encantado dirigir a Ysrael Zúñiga, formarlo.\n- ¿Fue real la posibilidad de llegar en Alianza Lima en 2021?\nSi, estuve en la terna para dirigir, algún socio o miembro de alguna comisión me avisó que me estaban evaluando. Hubo interés, además porque yo trabajé en Alianza, había gente que me conoce y muchas veces me han considerado. No solo fue para esa campaña, fue para otras también. No se pudo dar porque estaba comprometido con otro equipo. Finalmente llegó el profesor Bustos.\n- ¿En alguna oportunidad pudo llegar a Universitario de Deportes?\nMe llegó tres veces una propuesta para llegar a Universitario, uno fue cuando salí campeón terminando el 2008, en 20219 cuando con Municipal terminamos terceros en la primera ronda y otra que no recuerdo bien.\n- ¿Qué piensa de que Alianza Lima no considere a Paolo Guerrero para el 2024?\nYo creo que Paolo Guerrero es una súper opción, viene ser campeón con LDU, pero derrepente Alianza ya tienen armado su plantel.\n- ¿Lamentó la salida de Ricardo Gareca en la selección peruana?\nSiempre cuando un técnico consigue logros, uno siempre se identifica. Todos estamos convencidos de que hubiese sido importante de que continúe.\n- ¿Cree que el mal momento se podrá revertir con Jorge Fossati?\nFossati es un técnico con mucha experiencia y gran trayectoria. Tiene mucho recorrido, acaba de salir campeón con la ‘U’, dirigió a la selección de Uruguay. Hay que ver cómo le va en los amistosos, en la Copa América, dependiendo de eso se podría hacer un análisis. Lo que tenemos que hacer es apoyar a la selección para encontrar el pensamiento del éxito en las Eliminatorias.\n- ¿Oliver Sonne debe ser convocado otra vez?\nTiene la prioridad en cuanto al análisis y a la elección, nos queda esperar cómo va ese proceso. Todos estamos en la expectativa de cómo juega Oliver Sonne, es una incógnita del nuevo proceso.\n- ¿Es posible el cambio generacional?\nHay una buena generación de jugadores como Grimaldo, Quispe, Cabanillas, Távara, Lora, algunos ya están con convocatorias y otros que se están sumando. Yo creo que hay varios buenos jugadores y estoy que se irán sumando a la selección.\n- ¿Qué juvenil cree que tiene gran proyección?\nMe gustaría ver más a Jahmir D’arrigo, es muy desequilibrante tanto como Joao Grimaldo y Piero Quispe. Me genera mucha expectativa.\n- ¿Cree que le falta lograr aún como técnico?\nEs un logro seguir dirigiendo, no he parado de dirigir entre menores y la profesional, desde que empecé en 2006 mi carrera, antes fui asistente en el 1997. Le agradezco a Dios porque ya han pasado 24 o 25 años seguidos que dirijo fútbol profesional. Me faltaría dirigir en el extranjero algún día, eso me haría sentir como que he cumplido con uno de mis objetivos como entrenador de fútbol.\n- ¿Qué tal su etapa como comentarista deportivo?\nHa sido una linda experiencia, una opción que he valorado porque me han invitado y eso yo lo agradezco mucho. Me gustó porque desde esa tribuna pude contribuir con el análisis y las cosas que he vivido, cómo se siente un jugador, cómo se hace un replanteo, muchas cosas. Me encantó porque siempre de chico me gustó el tema de las comunicaciones, si no hubiese estudiado para técnico, habría estado en el tema de la locución, la radio, la televisión.\n- Alguna vez confesó que su otra pasión es la música...\nSoy melómano, me gusta la música en todas las facetas. Me gusta rock, la salsa y las baladas; más me gusta el rock en español. Hemos tenido una pequeña banda con unos amigos, mi participación fue corta como bajista. He participado acompañando a unos grupos en fiestas privadas.",

    "text": "Business Insider I made one small change while traveling with my kids. It cost $150 but was worth every penny — and I wish I'd done it sooner. Emily Hochberg December 29, 2023 at 12:02 AM · 4 min read 1 Link Copied Read full article\nI travel regularly with my two kids, which requires a lot of stuff.\nUntil this month, I always brought our own car seats and Pack 'n Play crib.\nThis time, I rented car seats and a crib. I paid $150 extra but the change made travel much easier.\nMy husband and I started traveling with my first daughter when she was only 6 months old. We began with local road trips and later flew cross-country to Hawaii and Mexico .\nWe would always haul our car seat and Pack 'n Play alongside numerous suitcases and carry-on bags. It was a lot , but I preferred having our own stuff.\nBut when my second daughter was born in 2023, it quickly became clear that this strategy no longer served us. We were massively outnumbered by bags to people.\nSo when it was time to take another family trip this past December, I ditched our car seats and Pack 'n Play. It was a game changer for us as parents.\nEven though renting seats costs extra, I'll never bring these items again.\nMost of the author's luggage while traveling with just one child. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider Previously, I thought it would be easiest and safest to bring our own gear\nAs a nervous first-time parent, I initially shot down the idea of renting car seats.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says to replace a child's car seat anytime it is involved in a moderate to severe car crash. However, according to Safe Ride 4 Kids , there is no way to inspect a car seat after a crash to determine the severity of damage. The safest thing you can do is throw it away.\nThis made me anxious. What if someone rented a car with seats and got into a scuffle deemed minor, but damage occurred, I wondered.\nMy daughter in the car. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\nFor this reason, we always brought our own — plus, car seats are always free to check in with airlines so it seemed like a waste of money to rent them.\nWe purchased a second, lighter 10-pound travel seat for travel for my toddler instead of her 30-pound Britax Boulevard seat that had already cost us $350.\nI also thought it was more reliable to bring our own Pack 'n Play after encountering hotels with heavily-used models in rough shape, and one instance where they were all in use by other guests.\nBut then we had a second baby and took our first trip as a family of four. We flew from Palm Springs, California, to Denver, Colorado, when my baby was two months old.\nStill in an infant seat, we brought her Uppababy Mesa with its required base, a collective 20 pounds. We also had my toddler's travel car seat, a Pack 'n Play, three full-size suitcases, two diaper bags, two carry-on bags, and a travel stroller.\nI'm still not sure how we all made it from the curb to the check-in desk.\nI do, however, have vivid memories of schlepping it all off a car rental shuttle bus at the airport — thank you, sympathetic strangers who helped us — then across two lanes of traffic, into an elevator, and across the terminal while wrangling a toddler and infant. Tears were involved, and not just from my children.\nKnowing we had a family trip to Orlando six months later, we vowed to do things differently for our collective sanity.\nThe author started renting travel cribs on a trip to the Hotel Del Coronado instead of bringing her own. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider Packing lighter removed so much stress\nAs our Orlando trip neared, I couldn't stop thinking about all the stuff we had to bring.\nPerhaps more at ease as a second-time parent, I decided it was very unlikely a rental car agency would ever allow a crash to go undetected. I rebooked our rental to include one infant car seat and one toddler seat when we picked up the car for an extra $156.\nWe also left the Pack 'n Play behind. We'd previously been able to use Pack 'n Plays at hotels closer to home without an issue, on trips to Huntington Beach and Coronado, San Diego. And before we arrived in Orlando, I requested a Pack 'n Play at each of our two hotels ahead of time. Considering we were visiting the very family-friendly Walt Disney World area, I wasn't too worried about availability.\nWhen we landed in Orlando, our car rental agency had two seats waiting for us wrapped in plastic. While they felt cheaper and less sturdy than ours at home, they did the job.\nThere was no problem at each of our hotels with the Pack 'n Play either, and we brought our own sheet to make it more familiar for our baby.\nWhile we still had a lot to lug between suitcases, carry-ons, and a stroller, removing our heaviest, bulkiest baggage made a huge difference.\nIt was such a simple change, I can't believe we didn't do it sooner.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\nView comments",
