    "text": "The Treacherous Walk To One Of Europe's Best Tucked-Away Beach Coves Is Beyond Worth It Some say the Calanque de l'Érevine is the most beautiful calanque (cove) in France's Côte Bleue along the southern coast of Provence. But reaching the exquisite cove is tricky, as it's nestled deep within the Côte Bleue, in an area of limestone cliffs that drop precipitously into the Mediterranean. Some choose to access the inlet by boat, but nimble travelers with a sense of adventure can get there on foot, too, one way being the Sentier du Douanier. The 2.6-mile out-and-back hike along the Sentier de Duoanier begins in the village of Niolon, about 20 miles from Marseilles. From Niolon, the narrow trail follows the rugged coastline, often precariously near the edge of the cliffs, and passes the Calanque du Riflard before arriving at the Calanque de l'Érevine. If you suffer from a fear of heights, this trail is definitely not for you. But if you're vertigo-free, reasonably fit, and willing to brave the rocky and slippery terrain, the otherworldly beach and sparkling clear waters of this calanque await you. Hiking to the Calanque de l'Érevine The hike along the Sentier de Duoanier to the Calanque de l'Érevine is not recommended for young children or anyone with mobility or balance issues. To [do this hike safely](https://www.explore.com/hike-climb/hiking-safety-tips-everyone-should-know/) and comfortably, wear sturdy footwear with good traction (but tuck some flip flops or water shoes for the rocky beach into your backpack) and hydrate before and during the hike. During the warmer months, start the hike as early as you can to avoid heat exhaustion, as you'll find very little shade along this trail. Another reason to get an early start is to secure a prime spot on the beach, which can get very crowded during the summer season. Use common sense on this trail: apply and reapply sunscreen, use caution in the exposed areas, and take breaks when needed. Also remember to stop to take giant gulps of sea-fresh air and enjoy the incredible scenery! When you arrive at the calanque, you'll be rewarded by more glorious scenery — a lovely pebbled beach in view of a small island — and the opportunity to jump in the crystal-clear water. Enjoy some time splashing around at this sublime beach before heading back the way you came. You earned it! Exploring more of the coast If you're still feeling chipper after your adventurous trek and beach time, consider continuing along the Sentier de Duoanier toward Méjean, a peaceful village set amongst rocks and pine trees with an enchanting little harbor. The jaunt from the Calanque de l'Érevine to Méjean will add about another 1.5 hours (one way)to your trip, so double that if you're going and returning. There are also other trails near the Calanque de l'Érevine that you can explore, such as the [hike along the Chemin du Jonquier](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/france/bouches-du-rhone/calanque-de-l-erevine) from the calanque to the Plateau du Médecin between Le Rove and Ensuès-la-Redonne. Otherwise, return to Niolon by following the Sentier de Duoanier back the way you came. Before leaving the village, take some time to relax and refuel at Auberge du Mérou, which boasts fresh, local dishes and panoramic views. Then from Niolon, it's about a 25-minute train ride to Marseille, a vibrant city that makes a [perfect home base for exploring the rest of the French Riviera](https://www.explore.com/1174055/marseille-france-is-the-perfect-home-base-for-exploring-the-french-riviera/). This entire area is a dream for nature lovers, with many more spectacular hikes, beaches, and quaint villages to discover, such as [the colorful beach town](https://www.explore.com/1521358/one-most-quirky-colorful-beach-towns-france-villefranche-sur-mer-dream-traveler/) of Villefranche-sur-Mer.",

    "text": "EL NUEVO DIARIO, SANTIAGO DE CHILE. – La Justicia chilena determinó este jueves la complicidad del excomandante en jefe del Ejército Juan Emilio Cheyre Espinoza en 15 homicidios calificados ocurridos en 1973, específicamente en la operación conocida como ‘Caravana de la Muerte’.\nEsta operación fue una comitiva militar con el fin de asesinar opositores políticos durante los primeros meses de la dictadura cívico-militar de Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990).\nParticularmente, la Corte Suprema determinó que se incurrió en error al calificar la participación atribuida al condenado Cheyre Espinoza como encubridor de los homicidios, estableciéndola en la complicidad y condenando al exmilitar a cinco años de presidio. Sin embargo, Cheyre cumplirá una pena sustitutiva de libertad vigilada intensiva considerando su «irreprochable conducta anterior».\nSe le impusieron también las penas accesorias de inhabilitación absoluta perpetua para derechos políticos y la de inhabilitación absoluta para cargos y oficios públicos durante el tiempo de la condena y al pago de las costas de la causa.\nCheyre ha sido procesado además por casos de malversación de fondos públicos en el marco de una investigación por fraude en la institución castrense.\nEn la misma sentencia, el máximo tribunal chileno resolvió elevar las penas de nueve militares en retiro por el homicidio calificado de los 15 opositores, todos fusilados el 16 de octubre de 1973 y siendo incluso algunos de ellos rematados con un tiro de gracia, según estableció la investigación judicial.\nEn el fallo, la Segunda Sala del tribunal supremo dictaminó que Pedro Espinoza Bravo y Juan Chiminelli Fullerton enfrentarán 15 años, en tanto Víctor Hugo Alegría Rodríguez, Jaime Ojeda Torrent y Emilio de la Mahotiere González recibirán penas de 10 años y un día de presidio.\nHernán Valdebenito Buggman, Guillermo Raby Arancibia y Luis Araos Flores fueron sentenciados a 5 años y un día de presidio como encubridores.\nSegún la resolución del tribunal, «la reunión entre la Comitiva y una parte del personal del Regimiento de Artillería N° 2 Arica de La Serena -donde Cheyre era teniente- corresponde a un momento previo a los delitos cometidos y en ella se revisaron los antecedentes estadísticos de quienes se buscaba acelerar los procesos que afectaban a detenidos políticos y en su caso, de inmediato proceder a ejecutarles”.\n“Tal tarea era propia de quienes conformaban el círculo más selecto de la Unidad Militar que era visitada por la Comitiva (…) sus principales partícipes eran, entre otros, Sergio Arellano Stark, Marcelo Moren Brito, Ariosto Lapostol Orrego, Manuel Cazanga Pereira y, además, quien era el ayudante del primer mando del Regimiento, el sentenciado Juan Emilio Cheyre Espinoza”, reza el fallo.\nLa dictadura en Chile duró 17 años y dejó más de 40.000 víctimas, entre ejecutados, detenidos desaparecidos, prisioneros políticos y torturados, según cifras de la comisión oficial que recopiló testimonios de víctimas y familiares. Más de 3.200 chilenos murieron a manos de agentes del Estado.\nDurante el Gobierno del actual presidente chileno, Gabriel Boric, se dio luz verde a una inédita política de búsqueda de víctimas de desaparición forzada durante el régimen pinochetista, que busca esclarecer el destino de los desaparecidos, que se calculan en torno a las 1.469 personas, de las que solo se han encontrado 307.\nEl proceso incluye, además, rendición de cuentas a la sociedad chilena sobre el avance de estas diligencias, junto con la implementación de medidas de reparación y garantías de no repetición de la comisión de este tipo de crímenes.",

    "text": "ROCKINGHAM — After not playing for nearly a month, the Richmond Senior High School junior varsity girls’ basketball team held on for a win Friday. A strong first half helped the JV Lady Raiders, who dealt with injuries in the second half, earn a 47-43 victory at home over Hoke County High School. The JV Lady Raiders rolled out to a 27-16 lead at halftime, but were outscored 27-20 in the final two quarters. The 11-point cushion at the break proved to be enough. Freshman Kaniah Little was Richmond’s leading scorer with 23 points. Sophomore Olivia Brown had 14 points. All six players scored in the win, including four points from freshman Iyana Little. Freshmen Kenya Bailey, Audicy Rush and Ny’Aziah Wilson each scored two points. “The girls played a great first half,” head coach Tonia Breeden said. “The second half they battled through injuries and cramps. At one time we only had four on the floor because two players couldn’t go. “I’m proud of how they didn’t throw in the towel and played through,” she added. “Kaniah had a great game even though she rolled her ankle. She didn’t quit. All six players scored and contributed to the win.” A 17-9 run opened the first quarter for Richmond. Kaniah Little scored her first 10 points on four field goals and two free throws. Adding to the strong start, Brown had her first five points and Rush scored her two points in the game. A closer second quarter led to a 10-7 scoring stretch by the home team. Kaniah Little and Iyana Little each dropped a pair of buckets for four points and Brown netted a basket to give her seven at the break. The only quarter Richmond didn’t outscore the JV Lady Bucks was the third. Hoke County went on a 15-7 spurt to cut its deficit to 34-31. Four points from Brown, a basket by Wilson and one free throw courtesy of Kaniah Little accounted for the JV Lady Raiders’ third-quarter scoring. Helping put the game away in the final eight minutes, Kaniah Little finished her big night with her final eight points, all on field goals. Brown hit another shot from the line to go with a bucket and Bailey chipped in her two points. The JV Lady Raiders (4-2, 2-0 SAC) will host Union Pines High School Tuesday at 5 p.m.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania from 1901-2000 was 29.7. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Lawrence County, Pennsylvania experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania history.",

    "text": "Two Aussie startups revealed new funding rounds this week and they have two things in common: they were both founded in Queensland, and they are both powered by AI.\nKeep reading to learn more about Springboards and Tendl.\nSpringboards: $5 million L-R: Springboards co-founders Pip Bingemann and Amy Tucker, with CTO Kieran Browne. Source: supplied Noosa-founded startup Springboards leads this week’s startup funding round-up with $5 million in seed funding from leading VC fund Blackbird Ventures.\nFounded by advertising industry veterans Amy Tucker and Pip Bingemann, Springboards bills itself as an “AI-powered platform built to accelerate creativity in advertising”.\nThe Springboards platform offers agencies nine AI-powered tools that have been designed to bolster creativity at every point in the advertising process. This includes helping teams uncover insights, generate ideas, validate concepts and design campaigns.\nAccording to the company — which has participated in a Google for Startups Accelerator program for Australian AI startups and has been named a pitch finalist for SXSW in Austin, Texas next month — its tech can generate between 10 to 30 times more creative diversity than leading AI platforms OpenAI , Anthropic and Gemini combined.\nThe startup officially launched this week but its platform is already being used by more than 120 advertising agencies globally. According to reports , the company has a pre-money valuation of more than $20 million.\n“Creativity in advertising is under siege,” said Tucker in a statement provided to SmartCompany .\n“Shrinking margins, skyrocketing pitching costs, and ever-higher client expectations are threatening the craft. We built Springboards to help creatives do what they do best: think big, explore boldly, and stay original.”\nTendl: $2 million L-R: Tidal Ventures principal investor Fee Barry and Tendl CEO and founder Laurie Nicol. Source: supplied Queensland AI-powered tendering platform Tendl also revealed it has secured new funding this week, after completing a $2 million pre-seed funding round led by local VC firm Tidal Ventures.\nStartmate, 77 Partners, Brisbane Angels and Aussie Angels also participated in the round for the startup, which was founded in 2024 by CEO Laurie Nicol.\nTendl, which is based in Toowoomba, is an AI-based platform that is designed to make it easier, and faster, for businesses to write, submit and complete government tenders through automated workflows.\nNicol told SmartCompany earlier this week that he plans to use the new funding to expand Tendl’s development team, while also expanding Tendl’s operations both in Australia and overseas.\n“Up until now, I’ve been solo. Before this investment, I did everything in the business. I wrote the software, I spoke to customers and I did all the marketing,” he said.\n“So it’s that opportunity to really grow the team and hire some more domain-specific experts, people who can help to run the engineering team, build the tool, and allow me to go and pursue the sales side of things.\nRead more .\nNever miss a story: sign up to SmartCompany’s free daily newsletter and find our best stories on LinkedIn.",

    "title": "Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Shopping for Items On-line",
    "text": "On-line shopping has revolutionized the way we buy gifts. From the comfort of home, you can discover 1000’s of products, examine costs, and have items shipped directly to your recipient. However with so many options and sellers on the market, it’s simple to make mistakes that may lead to disappointment, delays, or wasted money. Whether or not you’re buying for a birthday, anniversary, or vacation, avoiding common online shopping errors is essential to ensure a smooth gifting experience.\nListed here are the top 5 mistakes to avoid when shopping for gifts online.\n1. Not Checking Delivery Dates\nOne of the most common mistakes folks make is assuming all on-line purchases will arrive quickly. Many online stores provide estimated delivery dates, however these can differ enormously depending on the seller, shipping technique, and location. If you’re sending a gift for a specific occasion, failing to check the delivery timeline can result in a late arrival, which may break the surprise.\nAlways confirm the estimated shipping and delivery dates before completing your order. If attainable, select expedited shipping or order well in advance, especially during peak seasons like Christmas or Valentine’s Day. Also, watch for sellers that use third-party shipping from overseas, as these orders can take weeks.\n2. Ignoring Product Opinions\nProduct photos and descriptions may be deceiving. Some sellers use enhanced images or exaggerated language to make their products look more appealing than they really are. That’s why reading buyer opinions is essential.\nReviews often provide honest feedback on product quality, sizing, packaging, and delivery reliability. They will alert you to problems equivalent to poor craftsmanship, misleading product dimensions, or items that don’t match the description. Look for products with a high number of positive reviews and pay attention to recurring issues in negative ones.\n3. Falling for Fake Discounts and Deals\nMany on-line stores advertise large reductions, limited-time provides, or “unique” sales to create urgency and entice buyers. While a few of these promotions are real, others are simply marketing ways used to spice up sales without providing real value.\nEarlier than buying, compare prices across completely different websites to determine if the deal is actually a bargain. Tools like browser extensions and worth trackers can assist you monitor pricing history and spot fake discounts. Keep away from impulse shopping for based on countdown timers or flashy banners that pressure you to act quickly without proper research.\n4. Overlooking Return and Refund Policies\nGift shopping can be tricky—what looks perfect to you won’t be right for the recipient. That’s why it’s essential to understand the seller’s return and refund policy earlier than buying.\nSome websites have strict return home windows, cost restocking charges, or only allow store credit instead of refunds. Others don’t supply returns in any respect for personalized or clearance items. Always read the policy details and make positive you’re comfortable with the terms. Should you’re sending the reward directly to someone, ensure they can return or exchange it easily if needed.\n5. Failing to Double-Check Personalization Particulars\nCustom-made items like engraved jewelry, monogrammed items, or photo products can be particularly meaningful. Nevertheless, personalization adds complexity to the ordering process. A simple typo or incorrect date can smash the whole gift.\nAlways evaluate personalization particulars careabsolutely earlier than putting the order. Many sites provide a preview of what the final product will look like—use this to verify spelling, dates, and formatting. Don’t depend on autocorrect or assume the seller will catch mistakes. Double-check everything before clicking “buy.”\nAvoiding these common mistakes can prevent time, cash, and frustration when shopping for items online. Taking a number of extra minutes to confirm particulars, evaluate options, and read the fine print can make the difference between a considerate shock and a shopping regret.\nShould you have almost any inquiries with regards to where by along with how to utilize feng shui closet , you possibly can call us from the web site.",
