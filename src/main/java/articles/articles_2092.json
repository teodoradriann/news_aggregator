    "title": "Hamas Considering Latest Gaza Truce Offer In 'Positive Spirit' | IBTimes",
    "text": "Hamas says it is considering in a \"positive spirit\" a Gaza truce deal, while the UN warned rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory would require efforts not seen since World War II.After months of stop-start negotiations, Hamas has sounded an optimistic tone about the latest hostages-for-ceasefire proposal, raising hopes an agreement may soon be reached -- even as medics in the besieged strip reported fresh strikes on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah on Friday.Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group will \"soon\" send a delegation to Egypt to complete ongoing ceasefire discussions with a deal that \"realises the demands of our people\".Haniyeh, the leader of the militant group's political wing, told Egyptian and Qatari mediators in calls on Thursday that Hamas was studying the latest proposal from Israel with a \"positive spirit\".The stakes of the truce talks were thrown into sharp relief Thursday, when a UN report estimated it could take 80 years to reconstruct all the homes flattened over the course of the nearly seven-month war.\"The scale of the destruction is huge and unprecedented... this is a mission that the global community has not dealt with since World War II,\" Abdallah al-Dardari, the UNDP's Regional Director for Arab States told a briefing in Jordan.The UNDP assessment forecast the socioeconomic toll inflicted will cost generations of Palestinians to come and called for an urgent ceasefire.The only truce mediators have been able to hammer out so far was a week-long deal in November, that saw the release of 105 hostages for 240 Palestinian prisoners.Israel estimates that 129 captives seized by the militants during their October 7 attack remain in Gaza.The military says 35 of them are dead, including 49-year-old Dror Or.The government confirmed Or's death early Friday. Two of his children were among the hostages released during the November truce.Hamas and Israel have been at loggerheads for months over the terms of any new deal.The militant group has demanded a permanent ceasefire to end the war and the withdrawal of troops, which Israel has refused.While Israel faces regular protests demanding the government bring home remaining captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight on.With or without a truce, he has said he will send ground troops into Rafah, despite global concerns over the fate of around 1.5 million civilians sheltering there.The truce offer under consideration includes a 40-day halt to fighting and the exchange of Israeli hostages for potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain.During his latest whirlwind visit to the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the Palestinian group to accept what he termed an \"extraordinarily generous\" deal on the part of Israel.\"If Hamas actually purports to care about the Palestinian people and wants to see an immediate alleviation of their suffering, it will take the deal,\" Blinken told reporters Wednesday.Until Haniyeh's comments, Gaza-rulers Hamas had indicated a generally negative reception of the proposed truce.The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.UNDP estimated that as of April 12, at least five percent of Gaza's population had been killed or injured.\"The suffering in Gaza will not end when the war does,\" UNDP chief Achim Steiner said.\"Unprecedented levels of human losses, capital destruction, and the steep rise in poverty in such a short period of time will precipitate a serious development crisis,\" he added.The humanitarian crisis and rising death toll in Gaza have prompted demonstrations around the world, including in universities in the United States, Canada and France.Israeli President Isaac Herzog slammed the protests, charging that the US universities had been \"contaminated by hatred and anti-Semitism\".Colombia severed diplomatic ties with Israel on Wednesday, while Turkey on Thursday announced it was suspending trade.Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants are threatened by famine, but international aid has only been able to trickle in.Under US pressure, Israel has allowed increased aid deliveries in recent days, including through a reopened border crossing.US charity World Central Kitchen resumed delivering food to starving Gazans this week, after it had suspended operations following an Israeli strike in April that killed seven of its staffers.\"We realised after the kitchen closed that many mouths were left hungry,\" kitchen manager Zakria Yahya Abukuwaik said, while preparing food in Rafah.© Copyright AFP ",

The team decided to hold a virtual meeting instead, as a travel ban in certain areas has been implemented for safety reasons.\nThe Bills, coming off a disappointing defeat at the hand of the Los Angeles Rams despite a six-touchdown day from Josh Allen, travel to Detroit to take on the NFC-leading Lions this Sunday.\nIn a potential Super Bowl 59 preview, Allen and the 10-3 Bills will look to hand the 12-win Lions just their second loss of the season.

    "text": "Srinagar: Dense fog shrouded many parts of Kashmir where the minimum temperature dropped several degrees below the freezing point, officials said on Friday.\nKashmir is currently in the grip of 'Chilla-i-Kalan', a 40-day harsh winter period, when temperatures drop considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the Dal Lake, as well as water in supply lines.\nThe chances of snowfall are the highest during this period and most areas, especially the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall. 'Chilla-i-Kalan' will end on January 31 and will be followed by the 20-day 'Chilla-i-Khurd' and the 10-day 'Chilla-i-Bachha'.\nThe minimum temperature in Srinagar settled at minus 3.3 degrees Celsius, same as the previous night, officials said.\nThe visibility in Srinagar city and its adjoining areas was below 50 metres for the third day due to dense fog. The transport department has issued an advisory for motorists in the city and termed foggy conditions the worst in recent memory.\nThe city and many other places in the valley have been witnessing foggy conditions over the past week.\nThough fog did not affect operations at the Srinagar International Airport, flights arriving from other cities in north India, including Delhi, were delayed due to bad weather conditions there, according to the Airports Authority of India.\nPahalgam in south Kashmir's Anantnag district, which serves as one of the base camps for the annual Amarnath Yatra, recorded a minimum temperature of minus 5.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday night, the officials said.\nGulmarg in north Kashmir's Baramulla district, recorded a low of minus 2.5 degrees Celsius.\nQazigund recorded a low of minus 4.2 degrees Celsius, Kokernag town minus 2.6 degrees Celsius and Kupwara minus 4 degrees Celsius, the officials said.\nGanderbal, Bandipora, and Budgam recorded the lowest temperature of the season at minus 6.7 degrees Celsius, an independent weather forecaster said. These areas also witnessed very dense fog.\nThe dip in the minimum temperatures along with dense fog in several areas has caused many problems to the people. Apart from visibility issues, the cold and dry temperatures have increased common ailments like cough, cold, and other respiratory problems, especially among children and the elderly.\nThe doctors have advised people, especially children, the elderly, and patients, to take precautions like wearing masks and not to venture out unnecessarily in the mornings and evenings.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 29 December 2023, 05:27 IST)",

    "text": "AI in the classroom? \"I like researching it and typing it down on the Adobe Express.\" Jacob Singer, 8, and his second-grade class at Cold Spring Elementary in Montecito are using an AI chatbot to research historical figures, like Vincent Van Gogh. Second-grade teacher Sarah Schaupeter says integrating AI tools from companies Khanmigo and Magic School into lessons takes learning beyond the textbook. \"They're definitely more engaged right now. Like, if you look around the room, everyone is actively writing, actively researching,\" Schaupeter says. Cold Spring teacher Ryan Francisco says introducing students to responsible AI use under teacher supervision gives them tools for safe use outside the classroom. \"The students are going to be using AI whether we teach it in schools or not, so we're really looking at this as an opportunity to show them how to do it safely and responsibly,\" Francisco said. Cold Spring Elementary’s mix of AI with project-based learning has paid off. Last year, the school had the highest elementary school test scores in the state, according to the California Department of Education, which principal Dr. Amy Alzina says comes down to having a balance. \"My personal mission statement is to show what's possible and public education and when that integration component is there, really, magic happens, and I feel like we’ve done that. This is what every school should look like,\" Dr. Alzina says.",

    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan — The snow is coming down fast and hard this morning and is [ expected to continue ](/article/weather/forecast/weather-forecast/69-19905200)at this rate into the early evening hours. Here's this morning's breakdown: TIMING Snowfall began this morning and will continue at a consistent rate into the midafternoon hours for the greater Grand Rapids region. Snow will taper off from NW to SE starting at 6 p.m. and should be nearly done by 9 p.m. A few lighter snow showers are possible between 9 p.m. and midnight but do not look to bring additional impacts. SNOWFALL TOTALS 4 to 8 inches of heavy, wet snow is expected by day's end. We have already picked up a quick inch along our lakeshore counties and that trend is expected to continue throughout the day. We are expecting the highest snowfall totals to surround the I-96 corridor. This is where 6 to 8 inches should be anticipated, including Ottawa, Kent and Muskegon counties. The closer you get to US-10, the closer the totals will get to the 4-inch range. The I-94 corridor is expected to warm above freezing this afternoon. This could cause some of the snowfall to turn to rain, but also could cause it to melt. This will lower the impacts in those areas. IMPACTS Main impacts are expected on our roadways throughout the morning and evening commute. Because this is wet snow, we are expecting roads to become slushy and snow-covered. Winds will not be a problem with this system and remain relatively calm throughout the day. Visibility will be reduced at times within the heavier bands of snowfall. Due to this being heavy and wet snow, we could see isolated power outages throughout the day. THE WEEKEND Snow ends overnight tonight and skies will begin to clear into the weekend. This will lead to mostly sunny skies throughout your Saturday and Sunday starts sunny with increasing cloud coverage. Temperatures remain in the 30s all weekend long, so snow will stick around. Next week brings warmer conditions and rainfall that will likely melt much of the snow away. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

    "text": "一汽奔腾半年新能源渗透率83%，传统车企杀出“新势力”突围样本\n（来源：界面新闻）\n今年以来，新能源汽车行业在持续高速扩张之后，逐步进入深度调整期。政策驱动减弱、市场竞争加速、用户需求理性化，叠加技术迭代加速，行业正经历一场结构性洗牌。在这场洗牌中，一个原本被贴上传统车企标签的品牌，却悄然完成了从“追赶者”到“领跑者”的跃迁——一汽奔腾。\n这一论断并非空穴来风，而是基于实打实的销售数据及远高于行业的增速。今年上半年，一汽奔腾整车销量达到87517辆，半年度销量创历史新高，同比增长43%，超行业增速近3倍。其中，新能源产品销量达72552辆，同比增长近3倍，渗透率也达到83%。在刚刚过去的6月份，一汽奔腾的纯电产品交付量达到1.58万辆，进入行业前十。\n这份成绩是建立在行业整体增速放缓、部分头部新势力失速、资本趋于理性、用户更加务实的背景下，“含金量”可想而知。\n就此，不少行业人士认为，这不仅代表着一汽奔腾转型的阶段性胜利，更意味着其已从传统燃油车品牌真正蜕变为一家具备市场竞争力的新能源车;)企。\n此时外界关注的焦点是：奔腾的“含金量”到底是如何炼成的？对于目前的新能源汽车竞争格局有何影响？\n1精准卡位：细分市场“打爆款”\n中国汽车工业协会数据显示，2025年上半年，中国新能源;)汽车销量达693.7万辆，同比增长40.3%，新能源汽车新车渗透率达44.3%。但在这组看似亮眼的数据背后，是行业集中度加速提升、产品同质化严重、用户需求分化的现实。\n有含着“金钥匙”出生的豪华新势力品牌以高调姿态入局，却在资金链的紧绷中倒在决赛圈之前；有被市场寄予厚望的车企因内部管理混乱、资金运作失误而暴雷，最终“原地解散”留给市场无限唏嘘；还有曾凭借创新技术独树一帜、引领潮流的先锋车企，却因市场策略失误、产品定位偏差而逐渐失去竞争力黯然退场……\n在这样竞争激烈的市场环境中，一汽奔腾选择了一条“稳扎稳打”的路径：以产品为核心，以用户为中心，从而精准卡位细分市场。\n其首款纯电小车奔腾小马一出道就自带流量，上市首年交付突破10万辆，为一汽奔腾拿下绝佳开局；随后，在成功的转型战略与技术的双重赋能之下，一汽奔腾多款新能源车型上市即爆款。全新推出的新能源序列——奔腾悦意，以及两款车型悦意03和07接连登场。\n3月，悦意序列首款车型、越影平台首发车型奔腾悦意03正式发布。目前单月订单稳定在5000台以上，成为紧凑级SUV赛道上的一匹“黑马”；紧随其后，中国一汽首款BMP超级混动SUV——奔腾悦意07于5月底上市，聚焦超大续航、超大性能、超大可靠三大核心用户价值，成为“电混SUV新标杆”，并且在近期中汽中心开展的2025全域能效验证测试中，以远超官方标定数据的综合续航击碎用户的里程焦虑。\n值得一提的是，奔腾悦意序列双子星的装甲电池均成功完成中汽中心“超国标”安全测试，上市仅三个月新车交付量强势突破16000辆，为一汽奔腾的新能源转型之路注入了强劲动力。\n作为一汽奔腾全面转型新能源的核心载体，奔腾悦意不只造车，更在造一种“悦意的生活方式”。刻在骨子里的“用户型”基因，让一汽奔腾深刻认识到，售前体验与售后服务已然成为品牌竞争力的核心要素。为此，一汽奔腾建成353家“Joy Feel”悦意中心，并推出“三终身、两计划、一个家”的悦意321服务承诺，让用户购车养车更省心。这种“购车养车不绕路，服务就在家门口”的体验，成为一汽奔腾在用户心智中建立差异化认知的关键。\n更重要的是，这种服务体系建设并非“空中楼阁”，而是依托一汽集团的全国渠道网络与服务体系，具备快速复制与落地的能力。\n从灵动便捷的微型小车，到时尚实用的A级纯电SUV，再到性能卓越的B级电混车型，一汽奔腾在每一个细分市场，都以“标杆”的匠心悉心打磨产品。这种对于技术的坚持、对产品品质的追求以及对于用户需求的精准把握，让一汽奔腾在竞争激烈的汽车市场中找到了属于自己的赛道。\n2传统基因与新势力打法：一汽奔腾的双螺旋战略\n一汽奔腾的成功，本质上是传统车企转型的一次战略验证：不是放弃过去，而是融合过去与未来。\n作为中国一汽旗下的品牌，一汽奔腾天然继承了一汽的造车底蕴，其新能源技术集群——越影平台、逐日动力、如意座舱等，正是基于一汽集团在底盘、动力、智能化方面的深厚积累。\n同时，一汽奔腾也积极拥抱“新势力打法”：快速响应市场、打造爆款产品、强化用户运营、构建技术朋友圈。\n一汽奔腾的转型不是短期行为，更可以视为一场长期投入的系统工程。其规划的百亿研发投入，重点投入了电池、三电系统、智能化等核心技术领域。同时，依托中国一汽的资源协同，一汽奔腾在新能源技术、制造体系、供应链管理等方面形成了“国家队”级别的综合能力。\n如在制造端，一汽奔腾布局长春、盐城两大基地，形成年产能40万辆以上的智能制造体系；在研发端，其“两国四地”研发布局下，拥有超过2万名研发人员、1.6万项专利储备，为长期创新提供了坚实的支撑。\n自主创新研发实力赋能下，一汽奔腾还赢得了多元圈层的积极口碑，如携手华为、宁德时代;)等行业领军企业打造“全新技术朋友圈”，不断扩充丰富未来出行生态。\n可以看到，凭借民族汽车品牌的担当，一汽奔腾在全球产业变革中锻造新质生产力的中国样本，为汽车工业高质量发展注入澎湃动能。\n3\n一汽奔腾上半年的爆发式增长并非偶然。从产品打磨到服务体系、从技术研发到品牌战略，一汽奔腾都走出了一条传统车企转型的“新路径”。它没有盲目追求热点，也没有陷入“烧钱换市场”的陷阱，而是坚持技术驱动、用户导向、精准卡位的战略逻辑。\n因为，在新能源汽车的“下半场”，玩家们比拼的不再是资本和速度，而是产品力、体系力和可持续性。从这个角度看，一汽奔腾将传统汽车的历史底蕴与新势力的创新能力融合，为传统汽车品牌的转型升级树立了一个出色的“典范”。\n未来，随着在智能化、电池技术、用户生态等方面的持续深耕，一汽奔腾将不只是“新”，而是有望成为新能源赛道的“长跑型选手”。",

    "title": "Floods In Europe: Hungary, Netherlands And Lithuania Brace Themselves - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "[Europe](../) Floods in Europe: Hungary, Netherlands and Lithuania brace themselves Parts of northern and central Europe continued to grapple with flooding on Thursday after heavy rain. Netherlands and Germany erect flood barriers Flood barriers have been erected this week at numerous locations along the Dutch river Ijssel following an extended period of heavy downpours. According to authorities, water levels in the river that runs northwards through the Netherlands have risen “very fast”, sometimes at a rate of one centimetre per hour. The elevated water levels have been caused by recent heavy downpours, combined with severe weather in neighbouring Germany that has left soil saturated, making it difficult for water to drain away. A barrier near the German city of Magdeburg was opened for the first time in a decade to ease pressure from the Elbe River, while some animals were removed from their enclosures at a safari park in northern Germany. Danube reaches highest level since 2013 floods Water levels in Budapest have hit their highest in the last decade. Late on Wednesday, the peak level of the Danube that runs through the Hungarian capital was at 6.93 metres. Cars left on the closed lower embankments of Buda and Pest had to be removed due to rising water levels, the mayor’s office said. Parts of Budapest were flooded in several places. Heavy heavy and snow, which then thawed under exceptionally mild weather, aggravated the flooding. Lithuania braces itself for heavy rain Anticipating heavy rainfall in the coming days, floodwaters in western Lithuania are expected to rise. Although water levels have begun to recede in certain areas, a forecast of 15-25 mm of rainfall has created concerns. Western Lithuania, home to the delta of the Baltic country’s largest river, the Nemunas, typically experiences flooding in the spring. However, this winter marks the second instance in two months when natural water levels have reached critical levels.
