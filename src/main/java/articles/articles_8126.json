    "text": "KAMPALA – The battle for the control of Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC) continues.\nThe latest development is the suspension of Deputy Mufti Sheikh Abdallah Ssemambo following a petition endorsed by 15 members of the national executive committee.\nHe was suspended by UMSC national chairperson, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Lubega Kisambira on Friday.\nLast Tuesday, a section of UMSC had swore in Ssemambo as acting Mufti to replace embattled Sheikh Shaban Ramadan Mubajje over sale of Muslim properties.\nIn his letter addressed to Ssemambo, Lubega noted that his suspension, effective immediately, requires him, among others, to receive half his salary until the impeachment process concludes.\nDuring his suspension, Ssemambo is barred from his office and required to surrender all official UMSC items in his possession.\n“Be notified that the chairperson of the UMSC has received a petition of impeachment against you under Article 11(1) of the UMSC this 22nd day of December 2023,” said Lubega in the letter.\n“The petitioners fault you for conducting yourself in a manner unbefitting of your office and abrogating the constitution of UMSC contrary to Article 5(14) of the said constitution.”\nSsemambo was further informed, “that you are required to file and serve on the chairperson in triplicate a written reply within seven working days from the date of receipt of the petition”.\nLubega informed Ssemambo that a UMSC joint session comprising the national executive committee and College of Imminent Sheikhs will meet after seven days to hear the accusations against him.\nMahmood Kateregga, who is among the 15 petitioners, listed three grounds for Ssemambo’s impeachment.\nThe group accuses Ssemambo of participating in irregular proceedings that saw him sworn in as acting Mufti of Uganda, disregarding the UMSC constitution, and his involvement in the purported suspension of the substantial Mufti of Uganda and UMSC chairperson.\nJudiciary reacts\nOn Friday, the Judiciary said court had not authorized Ssemambo to act as the Mufti of Uganda, urging “all concerned persons to remain calm and act responsibly”.\n“The attention of the Judiciary has been drawn to misleading reports by sections of media alleging that the High Court on Thursday December 21 agreed with the decision of the Resident Judge Jinja in Company Cause No. 002 of 2023 that resulted in the appointment of Sheikh Abudallah Ssemambo as the Acting Mufti of Uganda Supreme Council,” it said in a statement.\n“This is to clarify that Hon. Lady Justice Alexandra Nkonge Rugadya halted the execution and implementation of the resolutions of the General Assembly made on December 16 and December 17 that resulted in the appointment of Sheikh Ssemambo as Acting Mufti pending the determination of the application by the same judge who made the orders under the law for Review of Court Orders.”\nThe statement further noted; “Relatedly, Miscellaneous Applications No. 309 of 2023, No.306 of 2023 and No.307 of 2023 have been referred back to Jinja High Court for hearing and determination.\nThe Judiciary, therefore, appeals to the parties and all concerned persons to remain calm and act responsibly, as we wait for the decision of the Court in Jinja.”\nThe Judiciary’s clarification came in the wake of Tuesday’s swearing-in of Ssemambo as acting Mufti.\nIt followed a vote by the UMSC General Assembly that forced Mubajje to step aside to pave way for investigations into the alleged sale of Ssembabule land.\nHajji Abbas Sekyanzi Muluubya, the UMSC general secretary, dismissed the election, arguing that Article 5 of the council’s constitution states that the removal of the Mufti from office can only occur through a joint session of the executive committee and the Majlis Al-Ulama or the College of Sheikhs.\nMuluubya noted that UMSC is operating normally and officially recognizes only one Mufti: Mubajje.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

    "text": "LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least five members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said.\nThe crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district.\nA large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, he said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back and five injured Christians had been taken to hospital.\nAt least one house and a small shoe factory was set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader.\n\"They burned one house and lynched several Christians,\" Bhatti aid.\nVideos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street.\nBhatti said the videos were images from the scene.\nReuters could not independently verify the pictures.\nThe independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs\".\nBlasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores.\nWhile blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\nA Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.\n(Writing by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Mike Harrison)\nBy Mubasher Bukhari\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

Trending Photos Team India produced one of the worst performances in Test cricket as they lose the first Test against South Africa by a huge margin of an innings and 32 runs. When the series began, it was not known that it won't be too easy to play against this strong South African outfit in their backyard but nobody knew that such a poor show will be put up by the visitors with both bat and ball.

He wrote in hindi on his X account: \"Puri tarah se ghutne teke hai team ne. Expected better.\" India's batting great Sachin Tendulkar was very critical of the batters, saying the shot selection left to be much to be desired. Tendulkar praised the South African pace attack for putting up a brilliant show, especially in the 2nd innings. \"While I initially felt the South African team would’ve been unhappy after the 1st innings, their pace attack surpassed expectations and showcased remarkable skill in the 2nd innings, in spite of the pitch becoming more favourable for batting as the match progressed.\" Tendulkar then added a criticism on India's batting, saying, \"From whatever I watched, India's shot selection left much to be desired.\" Tendulkar also praised the batters who batted with a lot of easy on a difficult track like Centurion. \"Throughout the Test, only a few batters, namely Elgar, Jansen, Bedingham, @imVkohli and @klrahul truly seemed at ease with the bat, navigating the conditions with technique and poise,\" said Tendulkar.

He said that India did not exploit the conditions and did not put up a show with the bat except KL Rahul. \"If we have to win Test matches, we have to come together collectively and we didn't do that. Guys have come here before, we know what to expect and everyone has their own plan. Our batters were challenged and we didn't adapt well. This is a boundary scoring ground, we saw them score many but we need to understand the opposition and their strengths as well. We didn't bat well in both innnings, that's why we stand here.\" Rohit added that the only positive that they can take away from this Test was the way KL Rahul batted. The wicketkeeper slammed a fine hundred in the 1st innings, taking the team out of trouble. But that was not enough to get the side over the line. Live Tv",

In the latest U.S. Drought Monitor, released early Thursday morning, not a single area in the state is still in a drought.\nLast week, nearly 37% of the state was in drought, including 13% in a Level 2 'Severe' Drought and 0.97% in a Level 3 'Extreme' drought.\nWhy? Our record rainfall. Atlanta received the highest 48-hour rainfall on record, according to the State of Georgia Climatologist. 11.12 inches of rain soaked the area, beating out the previous record of 9.59 inches in 48 hours, which had been in place since 1886.\nHelene was preceded by a separate tropical heavy rain event on Wednesday, September 25th. Then, the devastating Hurricane made landfall, sending more flooding rains into north Georgia and metro Atlanta.\nWidespread 6 to 14 inch rain totals were observed. Here are some of the top rainfall reports from the state, according to the National Weather Service in Peachtree City:\n- McDonough - 13.89\"\n- Brasstown - 13.18\"\n- East Point - 12.71\"\n- Stone Mountain - 12.52\"\n- North Decatur - 12.51\"\n- Irondale - 12.44\"\n- Dunwoody - 12.17\"\n- Tucker - 11.65\"",

L'epopea Nintendo uscita su Switch ha convinto tutti, ma con l'inverno che si avvicina è tempo di tornare in una Hyrule innevata.\nSebbene\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sia stato il gioco più cercato dell'anno in Giappone, purtroppo la Grande N non ha annunciato buone nuove. Tears of the Kingdom non avrà sequel, per cui la storia cominciata con Breath of the Wild nel 2017 è ufficialmente giunta al termine. Ciò comunque non vuol dire che non verranno più pubblicati dei Zelda sullo stile di questi due. Nintendo aveva infatti già chiarito che il modello adotto con Breath of the Wild è il futuro di Zelda, poiché i format precedenti, come ad esempio quello di Ocarina of Time, sono diventati ormai troppo limitanti.\nA dare un ultimo saluto a questa serie capolavoro ci pensa la cosplayer Carmen Sweetnaryu attraverso una magnifica interpretazione sotto la neve. In questo cosplay di Zelda, la principessa del regno di Hyrule esplora una zona montana completamente imbiancata. Coperta con una pelliccia candida per resistere alle basse temperature, la principessa ha i capelli lunghi come in BOTW.\nAltri contenuti per The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom\nChe voto dai a: The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom\nContenuti più Letti",
