    "title": "Salomón Rondón desató polémica en Argentina con sus declaraciones sobre la LIGA MX",
    "text": ".\nDespués de abandonar River Plate y unirse a los Tuzos de Pachuca, el delantero venezolano Salomón Rondón comparó la Liga Profesional de Fútbol de Argentina con la Liga MX. El atacante destacó la importancia de la liga mexicana, generando una discusión en la prensa argentina que catalogó sus declaraciones como “explosivas”. Estas palabras también tuvieron impacto especialmente entre los aficionados del conjunto ‘Millonario’.\n“Yo que he estado en distintos países, distintas ligas, lo digo sinceramente, no es demagogia, la Liga mexicana no tiene nada que envidiarle a ninguna liga del continente. Es una liga muy competitiva, con varios equipos peleando por salir campeón. La fase final, que se llama La Liguilla, es más picante, llama la atención. Tengo compañeros que compitieron aquí y cuando me llamaron no lo dudé ni un segundo. Lo hablé con la familia”, explicó en entrevista con Fox Sports.\n“Me parece que terminé el 22 en Argentina y el 23 ya estaba hablando con Almada y no dudamos en tomar este desafío. Tenía ganas de salir, explorar otra liga, otra cultura. Estaba necesitado de seguir compitiendo, que es lo que me ha caracterizado. Pachuca me dio la oportunidad, estoy agradecido”, señaló el venezolano.\nEl ofensivo de los Tuzos también habló de su llegada a México: “Desde que llegué que me trataron de 20 puntos, muy contento de estar aquí, de este cambio. Caí con el pie derecho en la Jornada 1, cuando jugamos con Cruz Azul, así que muy contento”.\nTe puede interesar: Los mejores arranques del América en torneos cortos como campeón de la Liga MX Rondón fue una apuesta importante tanto de la directiva de River Plate y de su entrenador Martín Demichelis, quien fue su compañero en el Málaga de España, pero los resultados no fueron los esperados en el conjunto Millonario, y no logró afianzarse como titular, por lo que el seleccionado de la Vinotinto forjó su salida del equipo.",

    "text": "A fourth-grade student compared former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry Thursday.\nHaley was speaking at a town hall when she called on the 9-year-old boy during a question-and-answer session at a New Hampshire town hall. “Chris Christie thinks that you’re a flip-flopper on Donald Trump issue and honestly, I agree with him,” the kid said. (RELATED: Farewell, Catturd? Nikki Haley Proposes Ban On Anonymous Social Media Accounts)\n“You’re basically the new John Kerry, if you remember John Kerry from 2004,” the kid continued. “So my question is, how — how can you be — how can you change your opinion on that in just eight years, and will you pardon Donald Trump?”\nWATCH:\nFormer Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a critic of former President Donald Trump and another presidential candidate.\n“I, for one, am very proud of you for coming, and very proud of you for listening, and very proud of you for asking that question,” Haley said to the kid. “So the first thing I’ll tell you is politics is about distraction, right? And so people like my friend Chris Christie are going to say, ‘she’s a flip-flopper.’”\n“But let’s look at it,” Haley continued. “What is he saying I’m flip-flopping on? He’s basically saying that I’m not hitting Trump hard enough, right? The interesting part of this whole situation is anti-Trumpers think I don’t hate him enough and pro-Trumpers think I don’t love him enough.”\nHaley also said she would pardon Trump if he were to be convicted.\n“I would pardon Trump. And the reason is, first of all, we don’t know what they’re going to find — innocent, guilty, any of that, and we want everybody to be innocent until proven guilty,” she said. “But the second thing is, if he is found guilty, a leader needs to think about what’s in the best interest of the country. What’s in the best interest of the country is not to have an 80-year-old man sitting in jail, that continues to divide our country. What’s in the best interest of the country would be to pardon him so that we can move on as a country and no longer talk about him.”\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "text": "God speaks to people but we must tune in Published 11:00 pm Friday, December 29, 2023 From the writings of the Rev. Billy Graham Dear Rev. Graham: Every Jan. 1 I feel defeated and disconnected to God, who seems far off. How can I really turn over a new leaf? – N.L. Dear N.L.: In the early 20th century, radio was just coming of age. Families gathered around a box tuning dials in an effort to establish contact with the unseen transmitter. In time, a far distant sound would suddenly break through; a voice could be heard loud and clear – listeners had successfully tuned in! God speaks to people but we must tune in. He reveals how we can find Him. The key is having a line of communication. God has made this possible; we can know Him as a personal Lord and Savior and speak to Him through prayer at any time. What God established between Himself and mankind is seen clearly in the coming of Jesus and through His Word – the Bible. We can find a new dimension of living. God sent forth His message of love through the birth of the One who forgives sin and the One who redeems sinful hearts – the Savior of the world. Many people believe that they know God because they celebrate the coming of His Son at Christmas, but we must be willing to submit to Christ by confessing our sin, receiving the free gift that He offers – His forgiveness – and turning our lives over to Him. A brand-new year is a wonderful time to say yes to Jesus Christ, turn over a new leaf, and follow Him. Tune in to God through prayer and the study of Scripture, which produces an outflowing of grace and power. The Bible says, “Now is the accepted time” (2 Corinthians 6:2, NKJV). Don’t put it off. Don’t say, “I’ll think about it, or I’ll do it tomorrow.” Do it right now. At this moment, say yes to Jesus Christ. ———— (This column is based on the words and writings of the late Rev. Billy Graham.)",

    "text": "Jim Jones’ mother wants her son and Cam’ron to finally squash their beef.\nSpeaking with Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson of Scoop B Radio , Nancy Jones expressed her concerns about the two Harlem legends’ ongoing feud.\n“So that’s something where they have to either work it out or don’t work it out and that’s how it is. I hate for it to be like that but sometimes it is what it is,” she continued.\n“I would love for them to get it together even though a little damage has been done. And if it was left up to me, I honestly would call myself stepping in but you know what? They’re two grown men,” Nancy said. “They are not young boys anymore.”\nNancy also recalled Jim and Cam growing up and when they first achieved success in the music industry.\n“Oh I was very happy for them, I told them to be very careful,” Nancy explained. “There were times they would get into little scraps and stuff like that and I would have to come between them and tell them to get it together. Whenever they got into their little disputes, they would get it together but now everybody is grown up and everybody wants their own. Everybody wants this and that, it’s kind of a little rough and hard to where I say ‘I’m going to control anybody.”\n“I don’t want to control nobody and I got tired of the bickering and carrying on, making yourself look like an ass out there to people on TV or Instagram or on the radio,” she added. “I don’t even like Love and Hip-Hop and the way they’re carrying on and stuff like that. Even though we started out like that, Love and Hip Hop wasn’t like it is now. I might as well call it the wrestling ring.”\nThe beef between Jim and Cam reignited “Capo” appeared on Justin Laboy’s Respectfully podcast. Jim said he took issue with how Ma$e allegedly treated Cam when he got his record deal.\n“I watched Ma$e sh*t on Cam and everybody around him. Like, all the time. I was Cam’s man, you heard? Cam and Ma$e were so-called best friends, and grew up together,” Jim explained. “I was there for everything. That’s one thing people can never say, is that I wasn’t there for every single thing.”\nTo kick off the new season of It Is What It I s, Cam attempted to set the record straight about Jim being around Harlem back in the day.\n“You’re a Guardian Angel in designer, n*gga…You are from the Bronx, bro. You are not from Harlem,” Cam said. “I did not grow up with you, my n*gga,” Cam said in his rant.\n“You wasn’t there, n*gga,” Cam continued. “We were super-duper popping in the street. Prior to the Internet. Everybody knew we were about to get a record deal…Basically, you heard our freestyles and you came up to me one day…and you said…‘Yo man, I heard the freestyles. Y’all killing sh*t. My grandmother died if y’all wanna come by and just hang out, y’all could, y’all more than welcome.”\nIn response, Jim has been teasing a possible diss track aimed at Cam and Ma$e.",
