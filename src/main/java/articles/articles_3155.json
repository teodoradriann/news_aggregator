    "text": "Singing Tolstoy's praises\nWar and Peace in a Chinese musical adaptation represents international cooperation, Chen Nan reports.\nIn a remarkable fusion of artistic vision and cultural exchange, the classic Russian literary masterpiece War and Peace is being re-imagined as a Chinese musical.\nThis ambitious project by the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing marks the first time that the famous novel by Leo Tolstoy is given a musical adaptation on the Chinese stage. It will premiere at the Beijing Performing Arts Centre on Dec 20 and runs until Dec 29, vice-president of the national center Zhang Yao, announced during a news conference in Beijing on Nov 20.Leading cast members also appeared at the conference, and gave a performance of Great Comet, a song from the musical.\nA distinguished team of artists, including Russian theater director Alina Chevik, composer Shu Nan, and playwright Yu Rongjun, came together to breathe new life into the epic tale.\n\"We spent two years working on the musical. Our vision was to capture the grandeur of Tolstoy's novel, while translating its complex characters and deep philosophical themes into the vibrant, emotional language of musical theater,\" says Zhang. \"This collaboration between Chinese and Russian artists reflects not only shared artistic goals, but also the spirit of international cooperation that brought this project to fruition.\"\nZhang adds that since its establishment in 2007, the national center has emphasized the diversity of performing arts, achieving remarkable success in the creation of productions, including operas, dances and dramas. War and Peace is the first musical by the institution, and its 112th production overall.\nTolstoy's literary classic is widely regarded as a monumental work of Russian literature. It is set against the backdrop of major historical events in the early 19th-century Russia, and follows the lives of four aristocratic families amid the tumultuous events of war and peace. It has been adapted many times into films, TV series, operas and other art forms, and is loved around the world.\nChevik has worked in the genres of musical theater and operetta for many years. The musical of Anna Karenina, another adaptation of a Tolstoy novel and also directed by Chevik, was staged at the Beijing Performing Arts Centre in October.\nThe director brings her deep emotional connection to this icon of Russian literature into the musical. Having worked closely with the cast, Chevik provided in-depth character analysis and meticulous direction and throughout the creative process collaborated with the composer and playwright to spark the artistic inspiration necessary to present this classic in a modern perspective.\n\"Turning War and Peace into a musical presents a number of unique challenges, primarily due to the complexity of the source material and the requirements of the musical theater format,\" the director says. \"It is a sprawling, multilayered epic, with a vast array of characters, intricate storylines and deep philosophical themes. It spans several years, covering key historical events, and delves into personal journeys, love, betrayal and the meaning of life. Translating this expansive narrative into the concise, emotional storytelling format of a musical is inherently challenging.\"\nShe adds that the creative team worked together to find innovative ways to visually and musically represent the novel's grand scale, from battle scenes to intimate social gatherings, while maintaining the integrity of the original material.",

    "title": "What is 'Cyber-Farting' and why a woman has been convicted for it",
    "text": "In an unprecedented legal case, a UK woman has been found guilty of 'cyber-farting' after sending distressing flatulence videos over Christmas. Rhiannon Evans, 25, is believed to be the first person ever prosecuted for such an offense after her actions allegedly caused anxiety and distress to recipient Deborah Prytherech.As per reports from the Metro, Evans had sent three videos on December 22 and four more over the next few days, including on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. After the incident was reported to the police, Evans was arrested at her home.Evans' defense attorney, Harriet Gorst, argued that the incident stemmed from ongoing tensions between Evans’ partner and Prytherech over child contact. She explained that Evans had been drinking at the time and did not intend to cause harm, acknowledging that her actions had since distressed the victim. However, the prosecution challenged this claim, with Diane Williams asserting that the act was purely malicious. “She was smirking throughout, found it hilarious—but the victim didn’t,” Williams stated. 117744542Rhiannon Evans was fined nearly £300 and sentenced to a 12-month community order. The court also imposed a two-year restraining order, requiring her to attend 15 rehabilitation sessions and abstain from alcohol for 60 days. In a victim statement, Deborah said that she would ‘would like to feel safe in my home’.The bizarre case has captured the attention of netizens, sparking a wave of reactions online. Many have expressed shock and amusement over the unusual charges. One user commented, “Cyber-farting?! Now that's a term I want to see put in the legal books. There's is a whole new legal industry blowing up (pun intended). What's your specialty young man? Admiralty law? Torts? 'I handle Cyber-farting cases but only of the two-cheek variety. I specialize.' Good grief @LozzaFox , how far must the UK fall?”117744557Another user said, “Watch this case set a precedent. Next up: Burp-based harassment lawsuits. UK legal system keeps topping itself.” A third user wrote, “What the heck has happened in the UK? 1984 was meant to be fiction. Not a road map”.",

    "text": "Redacción. En las vísperas de la temporada de verano, las autoridades de Honduras han emitido una alerta debido al incremento del riesgo de incendios forestales en 2.8 millones de hectáreas de bosques.\nDe acuerdo con el Instituto de Conservación Forestal (ICF), esta cifra es una de las más altas registradas en los últimos años, lo que representa una verdadera amenaza para la biodiversidad y la estabilidad ecológica del país.\nAdemás, el ICF presentó un mapa de susceptibilidad a incendios forestales, destacando como zonas más vulnerables a Francisco Morazán, Choluteca, Comayagua, El Paraíso, Yoro y Olancho, donde la sequedad y las altas temperaturas aumentan el riesgo de incendios.\nEn respuesta a este grave problema, el ICF ha tomado medidas para mitigar el riesgo y proteger las áreas forestales.\nEntre las acciones emprendidas se encuentran la construcción de 314 kilómetros de rondas cortafuego, la realización de quemas controladas en 197 hectáreas y el manejo de comaleos en 4.8 hectáreas.\nLas actividades tienen como objetivo reducir la cantidad de material combustible y evitar la propagación de incendios forestales. Además, el ICF ha mejorado los caminos de acceso en áreas clave para facilitar el trabajo de los brigadistas y la respuesta ante cualquier emergencia.\nMedidas de seguridad\nLas autoridades también han instado a la población a tomar medidas preventivas para evitar que las actividades humanas contribuyan a la propagación de incendios.\nEntre las recomendaciones destacan evitar quemas agrícolas sin control, no arrojar colillas de cigarro en áreas forestales y reportar cualquier incendio de inmediato.\nAdemás, se ha hecho un llamado a las comunidades a ser vigilantes y colaborar con las autoridades para prevenir siniestros que puedan tener consecuencias devastadoras para el medio ambiente.\nEl impacto de los incendios forestales va más allá de la destrucción de árboles y vegetación.\nIncendio en Honduras\nLos incendios masivos también afectan la calidad del aire, generan pérdida de hábitats para muchas especies de flora y fauna, y contribuyen al cambio climático debido a la liberación de grandes cantidades de dióxido de carbono.\nPor lo tanto, es esencial que la sociedad hondureña se mantenga alerta y se involucre activamente en la protección de los recursos naturales.\nLe puede interesar: Hasta tres incendios diarios en zacateras atienden bomberos en Comayagua\nEn 2024, en Honduras se quemaron 102,417 hectáreas de bosque.

    "text": "El miércoles 24 de julio, por la jornada 6 (adelantada) de la Liga BetPlay del segundo semestre del año, Millonarios FC, dirigido por Alberto Gamero, se enfrentó con el club Atlético Nacional de Medellín, entrenado por Pablo Repetto. El duelo se llevó a cabo en el estadio Nemesio Camacho El Campín , el cual estuvo a reventar. La hinchada azul se hizo presente en el principal escenario deportivo de la capital del país. No hubo afición visitante.El juez central de este importante compromiso fue Nicolás Gallo, el cual estuvo involucrado en diferentes polémicas. El cotejo, como bien se sabe, terminó 2 goles a 1 a favor del conjunto antioqueño.Joan Castro y Edwin Cardona marcaron para el equipo paisa, mientras que Danovis Banguero hizo lo propio para la escuadra capitalina. Millonarios, cabe mencionar, desde el minuto 19 de la etapa inicial, jugó con un hombre menos, esto por la expulsión del portero Iván Mauricio Arboleda .En rueda de prensa, luego del partido, Alberto Gamero dijo lo siguiente: “No era fácil ir perdiendo a los 9 minutos, una expulsión a los 19 y replantear un partido. Lo que pasó estuvo acorde a lo que pensábamos. La única que nos quedaba era 1-4-4-1, pero teníamos que intentar hacerlo con los jugadores que teníamos en la cancha para hacer un solo cambio. Me parece que Castro por la derecha y Córdoba por la izquierda mantuvieron a sus dos laterales”.“La superioridad ellos la tenían por dentro. Intentamos sacar un mediocentro como Welch, pero también queríamos tener la mentalidad de que con Silva y Charrupí íbamos a tener manejo. Nos arriesgamos a eso y el riesgo salió porque hicimos algo muy difícil que era empatar el partido. Después se nos va el punto ”, agregó.En zona mixta, cabe mencionar, también habló Falcao García, gran figura del club azul. “ Si vemos el desarrollo del partido, nosotros fuimos valientes ”, manifestó. Y horas después, el ‘Tigre’ rompería el silencio sobre el juego nuevamente.A través de su cuenta oficial de Instagram, Radamel Falcao manifestó lo siguiente: “No fue el resultado esperado en un partido que nos condicionó desde el inicio. Una vez más, gracias a toda la gente por su apoyo incondicional. Esto apenas comienza ”.Hasta el momento, Radamel Falcao García no ha marcado gol desde su llegada a Millonarios. Tuvo minutos considerables ante el Deportivo Independiente Medellín, el club Atlético Bucaramanga y Atlético Nacional.Hay una gran expectativa por el que pueda ser el primer gol del ‘Tigre’ en la Liga BetPlay del segundo semestre del año. Muchos confían, sobre todo los hinchas de Millonarios, que Falcao termine el torneo como uno de los máximos goleadores. Radamel, de a poco, se adapta al fútbol profesional colombiano.",
