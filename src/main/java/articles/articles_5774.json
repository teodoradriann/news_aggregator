    "title": "La Tierra registra su año más caluroso: supera el umbral de 1.5 grados Celsius",
    "text": "El año más caluroso jamás registrado en la Tierra El año 2024 ha sido marcado como el más caluroso jamás registrado en la historia del planeta, superando notablemente las temperaturas récord de 2023. Varios organismos meteorológicos han confirmado que la temperatura media global ha sobrepasado el umbral de calentamiento de 1.5 grados Celsius, establecido en el Acuerdo de París de 2015. Según el Servicio Climático Copernicus de la Comisión Europea, la Oficina Meteorológica del Reino Unido y la agencia meteorológica de Japón, el calentamiento este año ha alcanzado cifras alarmantes, con incrementos de 1.6 grados Celsius, 1.57 grados Celsius y 1.53 grados Celsius, respectivamente.\nLa principal causa de estos aumentos de temperatura se atribuye a la acumulación de gases de efecto invernadero en la atmósfera, generados principalmente por la quema de combustibles fósiles. Samantha Burgess, responsable estratégica de clima en Copernicus, subrayó que este fenómeno no solo afecta a la temperatura del aire, sino que también tiene repercusiones en los océanos, el aumento del nivel del mar y el deshielo de glaciares e hielos polares. El incremento de 2024 se ha dado en un contexto ya preocupante, donde los últimos diez años se encuentran entre los más cálidos de los últimos 125,000 años.\nEl impacto de este calentamiento global se manifiesta en desastres climáticos de gran magnitud, con pérdidas relacionadas que ascendieron a 140 mil millones de dólares en 2023, siendo América del Norte una de las regiones más afectadas. Los científicos advierten que este aumento de la temperatura no es un fenómeno aislado, sino un indicativo de un cambio climático que sigue acelerándose y que requiere atención inmediata. La comunidad científica enfatiza que superar el umbral de 1.5 grados, aunque solo sea temporalmente, debe ser considerado una alerta sobre la grave situación climática que enfrenta el planeta.",

    "text": "Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against TikTok, accusing the social media giant of misleadingly promoting its app as safe for children. The lawsuit alleges that TikTok misrepresented the frequency and severity of inappropriate content accessible to minors on its platform.\nAccording to the lawsuit, TikTok claimed that explicit material such as drugs, nudity, alcohol, and profanity was \"infrequent\" and \"mild.\" However, an investigation revealed that such content is readily available to young users. Attorney General Paxton stated, \"TikTok actively worked to deceive parents and lure children onto their app despite the presence of an overwhelming amount of profane and illicit material.\"\nPaxton emphasized that companies should not compromise the health and wellbeing of Texas children by providing false information about their products. This legal action follows a previous lawsuit filed by Paxton against TikTok for allegedly violating the Securing Children Online Through Parental Empowerment (SCOPE) Act. The earlier suit accused TikTok of operating in a way that endangered the online safety and privacy of Texas children.\nFor more details on the filing, additional information can be accessed through official channels.",
