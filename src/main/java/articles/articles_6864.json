    "title": "Caso Asso 29: Stato, capitano e armatore colpevoli per il respingimento collettivo in Libia",
    "text": "Il tribunale civile di Roma ha giudicato colpevoli del respingimento collettivo in Libia avvenuto il 2 luglio 2018 i ministeri di Difesa e Trasporti, la Presidenza del consiglio, il capitano e l’armatore della nave Asso 29. Dovranno pagare in solido 15mila euro a ciascuno dei cinque ricorrenti: due uomini e una coppia con un figlio. Al momento dei fatti lui aveva due anni, la madre era incinta all’ottavo mese e in Italia governavano i giallo-verdi. I cinque erano partiti dalle coste di Al Khums la notte del 30 giugno, con 150 persone. Saranno quasi 300 quelle intercettate dalla sedicente «guardia costiera» libica su più barconi. Uno di questi sarebbe affondato causando molti morti. A intervenire è la motovedetta Zawia, che però va a sua volta in panne, forse per le troppe presenze. Così viene chiamata in causa la Asso 29, nave italiana della Augusta Offshore in navigazione verso la piattaforma petrolifera Bouri. Poco lontano c’è anche un cacciatorpediniere tricolore: il Caio Duilio. Secondo le autorità finite sotto accusa sono i libici a coordinare le operazioni. Di avviso contrario i legali dei migranti che puntano il dito contro la nave della marina e i militari italiani presenti nel porto di Tripoli. Il giudice ha prima riconosciuto la legittimità della richiesta di risarcimento e poi stabilito la giurisdizione italiana, sottolineando come l’area Sar (di ricerca e soccorso) «non è una zona marina all’interno della quale lo Stato costiero esercita la propria sovranità o giurisdizione esclusiva». Al contrario è un’area su cui questo ha dei doveri, in primo luogo il soccorso. La Sar libica, dunque, non esclude la responsabilità italiana dal momento in cui i naufraghi sono saliti sulla Asso 29, che in acque internazionali corrisponde a territorio nazionale. Il comandante aveva l’obbligo di portarli in un porto sicuro e la Libia non lo è. Lo dicono i report Onu e la sentenza della Cassazione di febbraio scorso sul caso analogo, ma impugnato in sede penale, della Asso 28. Il giudice ha respinto la tesi secondo cui l’imbarco sulla nave italiana di un ufficiale libico avrebbe eliminato le responsabilità del comandante. Al contrario, quell’ufficiale non sarebbe mai dovuto salire a bordo. Anche perché lì vicino c’era la nave da guerra ed è impensabile che non abbia dato l’assenso, anche implicitamente. Proprio la Duilio sapeva che la destinazione sarebbe stata Tripoli: perciò avrebbe dovuto usare i suoi poteri di polizia e far condurre i naufraghi in un porto sicuro, in Italia. Invece dopo lo sbarco nella capitale libica i migranti sono stati rinchiusi nei centri di tortura di Tarik Al Sikka, Zintan, Tarik Al Matar, Gharyan. «Tutti furono sottoposti a condizioni di vita atroci: sovraffollamento, cibo e acqua insufficienti. Maltrattati, abusati. Fu loro estorto denaro. Assistettero a omicidi e torture. Uno di loro si ammalò di tubercolosi», scrive nella ricostruzione dei fatti l’Associazione per gli studi giuridici sull’immigrazione (Asgi), i cui legali hanno assistito i migranti. Il risarcimento danni è stato richiesto solo da cinque persone perché quelle sono riuscite ad arrivare in Italia, tramite programmi di reinsediamento, corridoi umanitari o attraversando ancora il mare. Per le altre non è semplice validare le procure dalla Libia. Gli avvocati, comunque, stanno lavorando con alcune di loro per farle entrare legalmente in Italia allo scopo di chiedere protezione. Tutti i cinque ricorrenti, nati in Eritrea, l’hanno ottenuta. «I tribunali continuano a ripeterlo: le politiche di esternalizzazione con cui si bloccano o respingono le persone in paesi insicuri come la Libia, ma anche la Tunisia, comportano gravissime violazioni dei diritti fondamentali di cui l’Italia è responsabile», commenta Asgi.",

    "text": "By Liam Doyle & Erin Rose Humphrey ,\n28 minutes ago Peeling one of the world's most favorite foods is about to get a whole lot easier and significantly less monotonous, thanks to a mom's brilliant life hack that makes the skin peel off almost instantly.\nMost people who are preparing potatoes for dinner dread the task of peeling the vegetable , which can be time-consuming and challenging, especially after a long day at work. One woman has shared her innovative method that saves precious time and doesn't require a peeler.\nIn a video posted on TikTok, user @quitmyjob showed a pot full of boiling potatoes, with overlaid text reading: \"Why did I ever peel a potato? \" The woman in the video demonstrates how she cut a shallow hole around each potato and boiled them until they were soft.\nREAD MORE: Woman says you're storing fruit and vegetables all wrong - and it's costing you\nAfter taking them out of the pan, she effortlessly slips off the skins, which had separated from the main vegetable due to the millimeter-deep circular cuts. She even seemed to surprise herself after trying the method on camera, exclaiming: \"So crazy that's incredible! \".\nMillions of people have since watched the video, with thousands more expressing their astonishment in the comments and vowing to try it themselves. After the clip went viral - racking up more than 23.9 million total views - one commenter described the discovery as \"important information\", expressing their shock in all caps, while another added: \"I've learned more on the TikTok than anywhere else.\", reports the Mirror .\nA third commenter expressed their serendipitous timing: \"Literally just got done peeling 20 potatoes and open TikTok and this is the first video I see.\"\nWith Thanksgiving on the horizon, numerous US commenters highlighted the potential of this tip for the potato-centric holiday.\nOne TikTok aficionado joked about their pre-Thanksgiving prep, noting: \"Thank God I found this before I peel 500 potatoes tomorrow! \" Meanwhile, another recounted a holiday epiphany from last year's feast: \"I saw this right before Thanksgiving and this has changed my life.\"\nThe revelation that some people peel their potatoes was met with surprise by several users.\nOne stated bluntly: \"I don't even peel potatoes... everyone getting the skin lol.\"\nAnother chimed in with nutritional advice: \"People take the peel off? That's wild, literally all the fiber is in the peel, along with a good chunk of other nutrients.\"\nA third joined in, astonished, declaring: \"Who takes the skin off? ! that's the best part! ! ! \".\nAmid the praise for the potato-peeling hack, one user played the skeptic, half-seriously threatening to take legal action if the trick led to an undesirable outcome: \"If I try this and it doesn't work and I have to peel mushy potatoes I'm suing.\"\nthey quipped in the comments.",

Taking to its official X handle, the Rudraprayag police posted, \"Today, on June 2, 2024, the devotees who reached Shri Kedarnath Dham are being given darshan in a smooth manner by making them stand in queues.\" The police stated that the deployment of security personnel is conducted to ensure cooperation and maintain safety. \"Security personnel are deployed at every point and at a fixed distance in the line system for cooperation and security,\" the police said. The Rudraprayag Police also advised the devotees to come on Kedarnath Dham Yatra only after completing their registration. Notably, the Uttarakhand government has made registration mandatory for all pilgrims coming for the Chardham Yatra. The state Chief Secretary Radha Raturi on May 22 issued an advisory for mandatory registration. With offline registration being stopped in Haridwar and Rishikesh, now devotees can come to the Chardham Yatra only after online registration. According to an official release, this step has been taken keeping in mind the safety and convenience of the pilgrims. As per the advisory, pilgrims have been asked to come to the Yatra only after registration. If they come without registration, they can be stopped at the barrier or checkpoint. And if this happens, they will have to face great inconvenience. Travellers have been advised to come to the Yatra only on the scheduled date after registration. Go on the same route as the Dham you are coming to visit. Tour and travel agencies arranging the trip have also been asked to ensure whether the passengers have registered or not. Raturi had sent a letter to the Chief Secretaries of all the states and union territories of the country, informing them that the state government had implemented the compulsory reservation system for the devotees coming for Chardham Yatra. \"The Government of Uttarakhand has implemented a system of compulsory registration for all pilgrims intending to undertake the Chardham Yatra. This measure aims to streamline the pilgrimage process and ensure the safety and convenience of the devotees,\" the Chief Secretary said in her letter. The Hindu pilgrimage Char Dham circuit consists of four sites: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. The River Yamuna originates from the Yamunotri Glacier in Uttarakhand. Pilgrimage season peaks in Uttarakhand for the Char Dham Yatra annually during the summers. (ANI) (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 27 , 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

Heavy rainfall could also become a concern if redevelopment and training of storms occurs behind this complex of storms this afternoon.\" In the west Panhandle, winds up to 70 mph are expected along with hail \"up to golf ball size,\" the National Weather Service in Alabama said. \"A tornado or two cannot be ruled out but confidence is low in the tornado potential.\" Parts of the Panhandle Bay, Walton and Washington counties were under a tornado warning Friday morning until 5:15 a.m. A line of severe thunderstorms were located along a line extending from Chattahoochee to 14 miles northwest of Stonemill Creek to 9 miles southwest of Panama City, moving east at 70 mph, the NWS said. \"Expect considerable tree damage. Damage is likely to mobile homes, roofs, and outbuildings.\" Jackson, Gulf, Bay and Calhoun counties in the Panhandle and Wakulla, Gadsden, Liberty, Taylor, Jefferson, Leon, Franklin and Madison counties in the Big Bend are under a severe thunderstorm warning until 7:45 a.m. EDT. A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect until 11 a.m. EDT for Bay, Calhoun, Dixie, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Taylor, Wakulla, Walton and Washington counties and until noon EDT for Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Clay, Columbia, Duval, Flagler, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Levy, Marion, Nassau, Putnam, St. Johns, Suwannee and Union. \"On Friday, the remainder of the front will move off most of the Atlantic Coast, while parts of the boundary will linger over Florida on Saturday,\" National Weather Service forecaster Paul Ziegenfelder said Thursday. The storms are not expected to be nearly as powerful or dangerous as the severe weather that ripped through Tennessee Wednesday that was responsible for the deaths of at least two people. Local forecasts predict thunderstorms and showers passing over North Florida Friday, bringing up to an inch of rain. However, AccuWeather warns that airports in major metro areas from Washington, D.C. down to Birmingham, Alabama may experience lengthy delays and possible flight cancellations for people traveling ahead of Mother's Day on Sunday.

    "text": "Elon Musk's Potential IPO: A Game-Changer for Global Markets\nHenry TurnerUpdated: 02-27-2025 05:13 PM\nElon Musk's Groundbreaking IPO Prediction\nIn the realm of technology and innovation, few make waves quite like Elon Musk. Recently, James Altucher, a prominent tech forecaster, has put forth a compelling prediction regarding Musk's potential plans for an IPO involving Starlink, the satellite internet project poised to revolutionize global connectivity.\nThe Significance of Starlink\nStarlink has emerged as a leader in providing affordable, high-speed internet access to underserved areas around the globe. Unlike conventional internet services reliant on physical infrastructure, Starlink utilizes a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites to serve its customers, delivering reliable connections even in the most isolated locations.\nRevolutionizing Connectivity\nStarlink’s innovative approach reshapes not just the telecommunications landscape but also the way we access information and communicate. With over 2.6 million active users, its rapid adoption underscores a profound shift in consumer preferences -- a preference for flexible, high-speed internet options that traditional providers struggle to meet.\nSpeculation Around the IPO\nAltucher has indicated that March 13, 2025, could be a pivotal day for Musk’s ventures, with predictions suggesting that an announcement regarding Starlink's IPO could be on the horizon. Factors contributing to this speculation include:\n- Achieved Profitability: Musk previously mentioned that an IPO would be feasible only after Starlink showcased sustained profitability. Current reports indicate the company has reached this critical milestone.\n- Strategic Corporate Moves: SpaceX has been quietly restructuring its corporate framework, leading experts to believe these maneuvers are designed with an IPO in mind.\n- Market Disruption: Starlink is causing ripples in the telecom industry by offering competitive pricing and speeds that challenge existing broadband providers.\nA Future Shaped by Starlink\nThe potential IPO could drastically reshape not just financial markets but global communication as a whole. For comparison, Saudi Aramco's IPO, which raised a record $26 billion, could be surpassed by Starlink, whose initial valuation might exceed $100 billion on its debut.\nInvestors and Opportunities\nAs Altucher notes, historical opportunities like this often provide rare chances for investors to capitalize on incredible market shifts. The vast wealth created during such transitions lies within the grasp of those who are vigilant.\nElon Musk: The Impactful Innovator\nElon Musk has already made indelible marks on industries with ventures like Tesla and SpaceX. An IPO of Starlink would further solidify his legacy as one of the most pivotal entrepreneurs of this era. This public offering would not only serve investors eager to partake in the company's expansion but also aid in fueling further advancements in satellite communications.\nThe Road Ahead\nWith rumors swirling and anticipation building, observers must keep a close eye on the developments surrounding this predicted IPO. As Starlink prepares to potentially lead this new era of connectivity, the world eagerly awaits what Musk and his team will unveil.\nAbout James Altucher\nJames Altucher has established himself as a leading voice in technology forecasting, business strategy, and entrepreneurship. His insights have been recognized in reputable publications, cementing his status as a trusted advisor to investors and innovators eager to capitalize on new trends.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the significance of Elon Musk's potential IPO?\nThe potential IPO of Starlink could reshape the telecommunications industry, setting records for initial public offerings and improving global internet access.\nHow could Starlink's IPO affect market dynamics?\nShould it go public, Starlink's IPO is expected to disrupt existing market structures, potentially increasing competition among internet service providers.\nWhat milestones must Starlink achieve before going public?\nOne primary milestone is demonstrating sustained profitability, which reports suggest has already been achieved.\nWhy is March 13, 2025, considered a pivotal date?\nThis date has been speculated as when Musk may make a significant announcement regarding Starlink's IPO plans.\nWho is James Altucher?\nJames Altucher is a noted entrepreneur and tech forecaster, recognized for identifying emerging industry trends and opportunities before they unfold.\nAbout The Author\nContact Henry Turner privately here.

As informações são da People.\nO site obteve documentos judiciais apresentados no Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles, que mostrar como a artista solicita ser a única tutora dos bens do filho mais novo, com argumento de que ele é \"substancialmente incapaz de administrar os próprios recursos financeiros.\"\n+++LEIA MAIS: O melhor filme de Cher, segundo Tom Hanks: 'Perfeição cinematográfica'\nAlém disso, a ação judicial explica como um tutor para Elijah é \"urgentemente necessário\" para \"protegê-lo contra perdas ou ferimentos,\" porque ele \"atualmente é incapaz de administrar seus bens devido a graves problemas de saúde mental e abuso de substâncias.\" O processo também afirma como Marie Angela King, esposa do filho de Cher, não está apta para a função de tutora porque \"a relação tumultuada deles foi marcada por um ciclo de dependência de drogas e crises de saúde mental.\"\nElijah tem direito a distribuições regulares do patrimônio, mas dados os contínuos problemas de saúde mental e abuso de substâncias, teme que quaisquer fundos distribuídos a Elijah sejam imediatamente gastos em drogas, deixando Elijah sem bens para se sustentar e colocando a vida de Elijah em risco.\nPor fim, o processo conclui como Cher supostamente \"trabalhou incansavelmente para colocar Elijah em tratamento e obter a ajuda de que precisava,\" assim como \"ama imensamente Elijah e sempre agiu com os melhores interesses em mente. \"[A cantora tem sido] incapaz de discutir as preferências em relação à nomeação de um tutor temporário por conta dos atuais problemas de saúde física e mental.\"\n+++LEIA MAIS: Cher se pronuncia sobre exclusão do Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: 'Podem ir tomar naquele lugar'\nComo People relatou, a audiência para uma ordem de tutela temporária está atualmente marcada para o dia 5 de janeiro de 2024, enquanto a audiência para uma ordem permanente ocorrerá cerca de dois meses depois, em 6 de março.",

    "text": "Des soldats d'élite de l'armée suédoise se frottent les mains près de leur véhicule blindé, lors d'un exercice militaire de l'Otan vendredi dans l'Arctique norvégien.Et le froid n'explique pas tout. Ces soldats suédois sont aussi très satisfaits de participer, enfin à part entière, à cet exercice militaire de grande envergure, le premier depuis que leur pays est officiellement devenu jeudi le 32e membre de l'Alliance atlantique. L'invasion russe de l'Ukraine le 24 février 2022 a décidé la Suède à renoncer à 200 ans de neutralité pour rejoindre l'Otan. Non sans mal. La Turquie et la Hongrie, pour des raisons différentes, s'y sont opposé pendant deux ans avant de lever leur veto au début de cette année.«Je pense que ça valait vraiment le coup d'attendre», déclare à l'AFP Karl-Johan Ryden, 21 ans, l'officier suédois commandant l'un des navires participant dans le nord de la Norvège à cet exercice militaire.Un soldat suédois d&#039;une unité amphibie participe à un exercice de l&#039;Otan à Alta, dans l&#039;Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 / Heiko Junge / NTB/AFP «C'était un très long processus», renchérit le commandant Joakim Sjögren. «Mais on a toujours cru que ce serait un oui en définitive, donc on s'était préparé à cela», ajoute-t-il.Le Nordic Response exercise (exercice de réponse nordique), fait partie de l'opération Steadfast, le plus important exercice militaire lancé par l'Otan depuis la fin de la guerre froide, avec quelque 90.000 hommes et femmes mobilisés.«L'adhésion élimine des obstacles»Et si la Suède y participe cette fois à part entière, ce n'est pas la première fois que son armée se retrouve aux côtés des Alliés pour un exercice militaire ou une mission de l'Otan.le commandant suédois pour les opérations conjointes, Carl-Johan Edström, lors d&#039;un exercice militaire de l&#039;Otan, à Alta, dans l&#039;Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 / Jonathan NACKSTRAND / AFP «Je dirai qu'au niveau tactique, au niveau des unités, pour les soldats et les officiers, il n'y a pas vraiment de gros changements, parce que nous nous entraînons avec l'Otan ou participons à des opérations de l'Alliance depuis les années 2000», a expliqué de son côté le commandant suédois pour les opérations conjointes, Carl-Johan Edström.«Mais pour la Suède en général, il s'agit bien sûr d'un gros changement. C'est le plus important depuis 200 ans, un vrai changement d'état d'esprit», a-t-il ajouté.Le vice-amiral norvégien Rune Andersen estime de son côté que l'adhésion de la Suède à l'Otan, après celle de la Finlande l'an dernier, ouvre «une nouvelle ère dans la manière de coopérer en matière de défense dans la région nordique».Un soldat suédois participe à un exercice militaire de l&#039;Otan, le 8 mars 2024, à Alta, en Norvège / Jonathan NACKSTRAND / AFP «Nous travaillons ensemble depuis longtemps, mais l'adhésion élimine beaucoup d'obstacles», souligne-t-il depuis le pont d'un navire des garde-côtes norvégiens.Selon ce gradé norvégien, la Suède peut maintenant être totalement intégrée aux plans de défense de l'Otan, ce qui n'était pas le cas auparavant. Et surtout, elle va désormais bénéficier de la protection de l'article 5 du traité de l'Atlantique nord, qui a créé l'Otan en 1949. Position stratégiquePilier de l'Alliance, cet article prévoit l'obligation pour chaque pays membre, y compris la Suède, d'aider les autres alliés en cas d'attaque, a encore expliqué cet officier norvégien.Des soldats suédois d&#039;une unité amphibie participent à un exercice de l&#039;Otan à Alta, dans l&#039;Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 / Jonathan NACKSTRAND / AFP Et pour le vice-amiral américain Douglas Perry, à la tête du Norfolk Command de l'Otan qui contrôle l'Atlantique et les régions arctiques, l'adhésion de la Suède va permettre à l'Alliance de l'intégrer totalement à ses scénarios de défense contre la menace russe.Et sur ce point, «ils mettent beaucoup de choses sur la table», a-t-il affirmé, en soulignant la position stratégique de la Suède dans les Mers baltique et arctique.La Suède a décidé de rejoindre l'Otan au moment où la perspective d'un conflit entre la Russie et les Alliés semble désormais moins éloignée depuis l'invasion russe de l'Ukraine.La nouvelle recrue Vera Nylander à bord d&#039;un navire de guerre suédois, lors d&#039;un exercice militaire de l&#039;Otan, à Alta, dans l&#039;Arctique norvégien, le 8 mars 2024 / Heiko Junge / NTB/AFP A bord d'un navire de guerre suédois, la nouvelle recrue Vera Nylander, appuyée sur sa mitrailleuse, garde cependant tout son sang froid.«Je prendrai les choses comme elles viennent», affirme-t-elle avec flegme. «Je pense que nous sommes prêts, on s'est entraîné pour cela, si cela doit se produire».",

    "title": "Rusia.- La viuda de Navalni acusa a Putin de mantener el cuerpo como \"rehén\" y cuestiona su \"falso\" cristianismo",
    "text": "MADRID, 24 Feb. (EUROPA PRESS) - La viuda del difunto opositor ruso Alexei Navalni, Yulia Navalnaya, ha acusado al presidente, Vladimir Putin, de mantener como \"rehén\" el cuerpo y de incurrir en numerosos chantajes para tratar de llevar a cabo un \"funeral secreto\", lo que a su juicio demuestra que es \"falso\" que el mandatario cumpla las premisas cristianas de las que presume en actos públicos. Más de una semana después del fallecimiento de Navalni, \"su muerte no ha sido suficiente para Putin\", ha lamentado su viuda, en un vídeo en el que ha asegurado que ahora las autoridades \"se burlan\" y \"chantajean\" a la madre, amenazándola con enterrar el cuerpo en la cárcel donde perdió la vida. Navalnaya ha subrayado que \"Putin es el único responsable\" de la actual situación, quien da las órdenes, \"el mismo al que le gusta demostrar que es un devoto cristiano\". El vídeo muestra, de hecho, al presidente en varios actos públicos vinculados a la iglesia ortodoxa. \"Ya sabíamos que la fe de Putin era falsa, pero ahora se ha visto más claramente que nunca\", ha sentenciado la viuda, que considera que \"ningún verdadero cristiano haría lo que Putin está haciendo con el cuerpo de Alexei\". Considera que incurre incluso en el \"satanismo\". Por este motivo, ha reclamado que la familia pueda recuperar \"sin condiciones\" el cuerpo: \"Le torturaste en vida y ahora le sigues torturando en muerte\". Navalnaya también ha aprovechado para vincular esta supuesta falsa religiosidad de Putin con la invasión iniciada sobre Ucrania, de la que este sábado se cumplen precisamente dos años. \"Dices que luchas contra el mal occidental que interfiere en nuestros valores tradicionales, pero solo matas. Bombardeas a civiles de noche, con misiles consagrados en iglesias\", ha criticado en su alocución.",

    "title": "Hillary Clinton Uses Anniversary of D-Day to Compare Trump to Hitler",
    "text": "Perhaps angered by her political irrelevance in 2024, onetime Democratic nominee for president and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton took to X to seemingly compare presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. The former first lady used the anniversary of D-Day to make her opinion known.\n“Eighty years ago today, thousands of brave Americans fought to protect democracy on the shores of Normandy,” Clinton posted on X. “This November, all we have to do is vote.”\nClinton appears to have turned off the ability to reply to the post for all but her followers, but that hasn’t stopped some from commenting about her ludicrous comparison.\nBelieve it or not, some defended the egregious comment. German-based user DAG posted: “As usual, Hillary is absolutely right with this tweet about Trump and November 5th, the D-Day of our time. And you at FOX NEWS know it too. Trump is using Hitler-speak from Mein Kampf and wants to destroy US democracy with his fascist Project 25. So spare us your crocodile tears.”\nBut others were quick to point out the utter stupidity of the comparison.\n“What an enormously stupid and vile comment,”\nposted Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire. “Trump is not Hitler. And voting is not storming a beach under a hail of machine-gun fire to free millions from the tyranny of the Nazis.”\nOthers reminded Clinton of her blatant hypocrisy.\n“In 2016 you attempted to undo everything they fought for by partnering with Fusion GPS to launder discredited oppo in the press, and merchandise it into surveillance warrants on enemies through FISA,”\nposted talk show host Dana Loesch. “Were my WWII vet grandparents alive today they’d slam this.”\nIt’s not the first time the onetime secretary of state has used the Nazi dictator in a Trump comparison. In November of last year, while a guest on ABC’s The View,\nClinton said of another Trump election: “I think it would be the end of our country as we know it.”\n“I think he would be even worse now, because he was somewhat restrained, believe it or not, in the first term, by people who he hired because he thought they would go along with him and they stood up to him. And so now he’s going to — if he were ever near the Oval Office again — find people who have no principles, no conscience, who are totally tied to his fortune,” she added. “When I was secretary of state, I used to talk about ‘one and done.’ What I meant by that is that people would get legitimately elected, and then they would try to do away with elections and do away with opposition and do away with a free press.”\n“Hitler was duly elected right?” Clinton said. “And so, all of a sudden, somebody with those tendencies, the dictatorial, authoritarian tendencies, would be like ‘Oh, OK, we’re going to shut this down, we’re going to throw these people in jail,’ and they didn’t usually telegraph that. Trump is telling us what he intends to do.”\nInstead of treating the anniversary of D-Day as an occasion to remember the valiant sacrifice made by so many in 1944, Clinton decided to use it to make a tawdry political point. The obnoxious comment shows the world exactly where her heart is, and puts her vengeful and vindictive personality on full display.",
