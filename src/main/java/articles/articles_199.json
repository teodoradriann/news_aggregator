    "text": "Global Transport Workers Take Stand Against Single-Pilot Operations Global Transportation workers opposed single-pilot operations in commercial airlines stressing an emphasis on safety. This week, the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) took a stand [against](https://www.alpa.org/news-and-events/news-room/2024-10-17-global-transport-workers-unite) single-pilot operations in commercial airlines. ITF, which represents transport workers worldwide, joined the Air Line Pilots Association, Int’l (ALPA) and several other organizations in voicing its opposition for any efforts to diminish the existing crew complement requirements. The organization pledged to utilize all available resources to advocate against safety regulators approving such measures. “Some aircraft manufacturers are designing airliners to be flown with only one pilot on the flight deck during the cruise portion of the flight, and eventually with zero pilots,” said Capt. Jason Ambrosi, ALPA president. “This profit-over-safety scheme is actually being supported by some aviation safety regulators and airlines, contrary to the highest standard of aviation safety. Global transportation workers are standing in solidarity against this effort to undermine workers’ rights and safe skies.” ITF’s push for two pilots in the flight deck comes on the heels of an ITF survey in which a majority of the public is strongly opposed to single-pilot and fully autonomous airline operations. ITF’s survey indicated that 76% of respondents expressed discomfort flying on a plane without a pilot on board. “ITF’s survey confirms the public understands that airline travel today is the safest means of transportation, and they aren’t willing to jeopardize lives just to maybe save a buck,” said Ambrosi.

    "title": "Ukraine: Pentagon says “yes” to sending white phosphorus to the country – The White House disagrees",
    "text": "The Pentagon has given the green light to send white phosphorus ammunition to Ukraine, but the White House continues to stubbornly deny its proposal.\nThe US military uses white phosphorus shells to illuminate battlefields, but human rights advocates oppose its use near populated areas because of the chemical burns on the human skin.\nAccording to the U.S. network NBC, Pentagon officials have recommended that the Biden administration deliver such ammunition to the battlefield in Ukraine, but the White House has rejected the idea several times, according to three officials familiar with the matter who have not been named.\nNotably, white phosphorus bombs are not permitted internationally by the Geneva Convention of 1980, which explicitly prohibits their use as a weapon.\nThe dangers of white phosphorus\nWhite phosphorus is a chemical commonly used to illuminate enemy positions. Those exposed to it are burned and if they survive suffer terrible and irreversible skin burns.\nPhosphorus burns carry an increased risk of mortality due to the absorption of phosphorus into the body. In fact, it can lead to problems with the liver, kidneys, heart and in some cases multiple organ failure.\nWhen used in ammunition, white phosphorus reaches up to 800 degrees Celsius.\nThe Israeli forces have previously been accused of violating the Geneva Convention by using white phosphorus bombs during the 2008-2009 Gaza war with the Israeli military denying this.\nDuring the armed conflicts of the 20th century, including World War II and Vietnam, the U.S. used white phosphorus against enemy troops.\nThe Pentagon’s recommendation was to provide white phosphorus missiles to Ukraine to produce light and smoke, not for use against enemy troops.\nDistinguishing between enemy troops and civilians for use of the chemical\nInternational law requires soldiers using it to be able to distinguish between military locations and areas where civilians may be concentrated.\nThe Pentagon, however, was quick to recommend sending the white phosphorus ammunition to Ukraine as part of several aid packages, including a recent one, as Presidential Withdrawal Authority, according to officials.\nTwo of the officials said the stigma surrounding white phosphorus and concerns raised about civilians continues, putting the brakes on the Biden administration’s approval of the Pentagon’s proposal.\nUkraine accuses Russia of using white phosphorus in bombs\nFor his part, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of using white phosphorus against civilians in Ukraine.\n“This morning, I received information that Russian troops had used phosphorus bombs against civilians in Ukraine,” Zelensky said during a meeting of NATO leaders in March 2022. He did not provide evidence of their use and the Pentagon could not confirm their use.",

    "text": "Richmond’s First Baptist Church leaves Southern Baptist Convention RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - Richmond’s [First Baptist Church](https://fbcrichmond.org/) voted on Sunday to withdraw from the Southern Baptist Convention. “There were no cheers, no shouts of celebration, and if there were tears, I didn’t see them,” said Pastor Jim Somerville. “What I felt from the room was a mixture of quiet grief and gratitude, along with a sense that we had done the right thing.” The church has been part of the SBC for nearly 180 years. The church’s board of deacons recommended to withdraw in response to the SBC’s proposal requiring pastors and elders of its cooperating churches to be men. “We believe every Baptist church has the right to determine its own mission and ministry and to ordain whomever it perceives to be gifted for ministry, whether male or female,” Somerville said. First Baptist Church, which was established in 1780, says it has two female pastors on staff. “What that meant for First Baptist is that the SBC didn’t want us anymore, because we are not about to give up our female pastors,” Somerville said. “Lynn Turner and Allison Collier have those titles, but we have a number of other female ministers on our staff. We’re not giving them up either.” Copyright 2024 WWBT. All rights reserved.",
