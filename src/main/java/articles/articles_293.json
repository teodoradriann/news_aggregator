    "text": "Tragic Accident in Northwestern Turkey Claims Lives and Injures Dozens\n[World](articles/category/30/World)» [SOUTHEAST EUROPE](articles/category/151/Southeast+Europe)| December 28, 2023, Thursday // 11:02\nA devastating chain accident in the northwestern Turkish province of Sakarya resulted in a tragic toll this morning. According to reports from the Anatolian Agency, ten individuals lost their lives, while over 50 sustained injuries in the incident on the Northern Marmara highway toward Istanbul. The collision involved seven vehicles, including buses and a truck, with the reasons behind the accident still under investigation.\nReports from Turkish broadcaster NTV, cited by Reuters, indicated that thick fog and poor visibility were prevalent during the crash. Responders from various agencies, including the gendarmerie, firefighters, medical teams, and the Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate (AFAD), immediately rushed to the scene.\nGovernor Yashar Karadeniz confirmed preliminary casualties, citing 10 fatalities and 57 injuries, with some in critical condition. The governor mentioned that the chain reaction began after a car collided with a truck. Shockingly, some victims lost their lives after exiting their vehicles on the highway and being struck by passing cars.\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca shared on social media that 59 individuals were injured, with eight in critical condition. Efforts to clear the accident site and recover the vehicles involved are ongoing, resulting in the temporary halt of traffic towards Istanbul.\nThe Sakarya County Prosecutor's Office has initiated an investigation into the incident. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc confirmed the appointment of three prosecutors to lead the investigation, with six drivers already detained. Additionally, an injured driver, currently receiving medical treatment, will face custody upon recovery.\nWe need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

    "text": "Thomas Müller confesó que \"sería increíble\" jugar contra Boca y elogió al Superclásico\nEl histórico delantero de Bayern Múnich palpitó el cruce que se viene en el Grupo C del Mundial de Clubes y catalogó como \"muy especiales\" los enfrentamientos con River.\nA sus 35 años, Thomas Müller se ganó un nombre en el diccionario del fútbol internacional. Fue campeón del mundo con la selección de Alemania en Brasil 2014 y ganó múltiples títulos (32) con Bayern Múnich, el único club de su carrera. Pero todavía hay ciertas experiencias que le siguen generando expectativa. Este es el caso del partido ante Boca en el Mundial de Clubes, en el que compartirá el Grupo C.\n“Sería increíble jugar contra ellos. Como aficionado sé mucho del fútbol argentino por la TV, Internet y las redes sociales\", comenzó uno de los capitanes del elenco bávaro, en una entrevista con el sitio web oficial de la FIFA.\nNo conforme con eso, el delantero recordó su amistad con Martín Demichelis, quien fue entrenador de River entre 2023 y 2024 y jugó junto a él en Bayern durante dos años, y le dedicó palabras elogiosas al partido más importante del campeonato nacional: \"Mi ex compañero Micho fue DT y cuando juegan contra Boca es una locura. Cuando se enfrentan esos equipos tradicionales, es algo muy especial”.\nEl sorteo realizado en diciembre del año pasado determinó que el Xeneize integrará el Grupo C con el )equipo alemán, Benfica de Portugal y Auckland City de Nueva Zelanda). Por su parte, el Millonario cayó en el E y enfrentará a Inter de Italia, Monterrey de México y Urawa Red Diamonds de Japón.\nMás allá de la complejidad que presenta la zona, Edinson Cavani, referente del cuadro de la Ribera, no se achicó cuando fue consultado sobre el objetivo pro la página oficial de FIFA. \"Boca es un club inmenso, en el que cada vez que se enfrenta a un torneo o a la competición que tengamos por delante, siempre aspira a ganarlo. Vamos a ir a hacer un buen torneo para poder acercarnos a lo que pueda ser un logro histórico\", soltó, y aseveró que contra los bávaros \"es el partido más especial por la historia de ambos\".\nLas declaraciones de Cavani sobre el Mundial de Clubes\nMirá también\nFigal y Chiquito Romero preparan su vuelta en Boca\n¿Fanático del Xeneize?

    "title": "Have We Had Enough Grocery Store Price Gouging Yet? Time For A Federal Ban?",
    "text": "Kamala Harris to announce plans for a federal ban on price-gouging. If there is one thing that most Americans can agree on, it is that almost everything that regular people have to buy or spend money on in order to survive has gotten way the hell too expensive. Groceries, rent … well, mostly groceries and rent. That is why, at Friday’s campaign stop in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris is set to announce her plans to put an end to all of that, one of which will be a federal ban on price gouging. (Pause for terrified shrieks!) Harris also plans to address the problem of mergers between grocery stores and food producers “specifically for the risk that the proposed merger would raise grocery prices for consumers,” the campaign said in a statement. Because hey! If capitalists believe that competition keeps prices down, they should want to limit the ability of individual companies to monopolize any given market, right? Loving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that! Harris also plans to address the increasing costs of prescription drugs and housing, both of which are caused by greed and not any kind of necessity. Harris reportedly plans on singling out the meat industry, with the statement noting that “soaring meat prices have accounted for a large part of Americans’ higher grocery bills, even as meat processing companies registered record-breaking profits following the pandemic.” As a known enjoyer of chicken wings, I would very much appreciate this! How are we living in a world in which there are still dollar oyster nights everywhere but I’m seeing a dozen chicken wings for $26 at normal-ass bars? Legally, oysters are fancier than chicken wings and this just confuses everything. It would be one thing if we were paying more for things because of labor costs or even because of demand — as we were when the supply chains were snarled during the pandemic. But then companies got a taste for those higher prices leading to higher profits — and when the supply chains untangled themselves, prices stayed the same. As much as I hate to say this, we actually don’t pay as much for many things as we should and as much as we would pay if everyone throughout the supply chain were being paid fairly. Employers here want to keep wages down, which means that the people who make the things that we buy have to be paid even less, and in many cases, nothing. For instance, in the 1950s, when most clothing people wore was made here by unionized ILGU workers, the average cost of a middle class woman’s dress was about $30, which today would be about $390 (which is also why people would only have, like, five dresses total). That was fair. It also meant that the people who made those dresses were able to spend money themselves and contribute to the economy. But we’re not paying more so that everyone in the supply chain can make a living wage, we are literally paying extra so that CEOs and stockholders can get richer. We’ve literally heard them on sales calls bragging about the profits they’ve made from raising prices. These companies are charging more simply because they can get away with it. Because no one is telling them “No.” It’s time for them all to be told “No.” OPEN THREAD! PREVIOUSLY ON WONKETTE! ·",

I've tried talking to my family about my reservations, but they insist that it's my duty to save her because we're family.\" Her sister has expressed deep disappointment, suggesting that a refusal to donate would be proof of her lack of care: \"My sister is understandably upset and has been telling me that if I don't donate, it proves I don't care about her.\" Amidst accusations from her family that withholding her kidney would make her a terrible person, the young woman is caught between not wanting her sister to die and protecting her own well-being.

In the comments, individuals who have experienced kidney donation firsthand weighed in. One commenter offered advice, saying: \"Tell the transplant team you are being coerced to donate. They will then tell your family you are ineligible to donate. They will not say why because of HIPAA if you're in the States. Most countries have similar rules.\" Another pointed out that health concerns might prevent her from being cleared to donate by a doctor. A different user highlighted additional considerations, noting that some research indicates increased risks for women who become pregnant after donating a kidney, even if they are in perfect health.",
