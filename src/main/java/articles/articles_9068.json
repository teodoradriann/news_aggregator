    "text": "A diplomatic source has said that the US' willingness to provide Hamas with guarantees that Israel will not resume the war following a ceasefire-prisoner swap deal will lead to Israel losing the war, Israel Hayom reported.\nThe statements were made following a Thursday night Cabinet meeting, and following Arab media reports that the US is willing to provide such a guarantee.\nMeanwhile, the Israeli War Cabinet has promised that it will not agree to commit to ending the war, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that there will be a military operation in Rafah, regardless of whether or not there is also a hostage deal.\nHowever, the diplomatic source warned that from the moment the US provides Hamas with such a promise, \"Israel will be on a path to clash with the US, in a fashion which has not been seen before.\"\n\"Already today, we are having a hard time pushing off the American pressure. If as part of the deal the US makes a promise in our name, to Egypt and the international community, that the war will not renew, the significance of that is that we will be clashing diplomatically with Washington in order to carry out a battle in Rafah. Anyone with eyes in his head sees that.\"\nEarlier on Friday, Al Akhbar reported that following Hamas' failure to respond on Thursday night to\nthe Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire-prisoner swap deal, the Egyptian and Qatari brokers requested additional time before a final answer is received.\nAccording to the report, the brokers received clear signs that Hamas' response will almost certainly be negative, and that the terror group will not accept\nthe existing plan.\nThe newspaper also said that an additional Hamas delegation, led by Khalil al-Hayya, will arrive in Cairo with proposals for amendments to the current agreement. Sources also told Al Akhbar that \"Hamas wants confirmation regarding\nthe full withdrawal of IDF forces from all areas in Gaza, and especially from Wadi Gaza or the area of Netzarim - and this withdrawal must be undertaken, from its perspective, as soon as possible, with the promise of full freedom of movement between the northern and southern Strip.\"\nHamas is also demanding a comprehensive ceasefire, and that Turkey be a guarantor to the agreement, along with the US, Egypt, and Qatar.",

    "text": "In an arid landscape where the quest for water has often been synonymous with struggle, a transformative initiative is taking root, promising to redefine the lives of thousands. On Thursday, Murang'a South sub-county witnessed a significant leap towards sustainable development and improved living standards with the commissioning of the Maragua Bulk Water Supply and Irrigation Project by President William Ruto. This ambitious project, costing 1 billion shillings, is not just a testament to the government's commitment to enhancing access to clean water but also a beacon of hope for over 30,000 households in the region.\nQuenching the Thirst of Thousands\nThe Maragua project stands as a monumental achievement with a daily capacity of 15 million litres, designed to address the longstanding water scarcity that has beleaguered the semi-arid regions of Murang'a South. The initiative brings to fruition the promise of piped water to more than 18,000 households, marking a pivotal shift from the uncertainty of water access to the assurance of a constant supply. Beyond the mere numbers, the project encapsulates a story of resilience and collective effort towards securing one of the most fundamental human needs — water.\nA Dual Benefit: Domestic Use and Irrigation\nCompleted in early 2023, the dam is a dual-purpose marvel, set to supply clean water for domestic use to 11,000 residents and facilitate irrigation for 7,000 individuals. The distinction here lies not only in the scale of the project but also in its holistic approach to community development. By addressing both domestic and agricultural needs, the Maragua project lays the groundwork for a more self-sufficient community, where clean water can spur health improvements and irrigation can boost agricultural productivity, fostering economic growth and food security in equal measure.\nGovernment Commitment and Future Prospects\nPresident Ruto's announcement of an allocation of 180 million shillings for last-mile water connections underscores the government's dedication to ensuring that the benefits of this project reach directly into the homes of the residents. This financial commitment is a critical component of the project's success, ensuring that the infrastructure developed does not merely exist but actively enhances the quality of life for the people of Murang'a South. Managed by Murang'a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco), the dam, boasting a daily capacity of 15,000 cubic meters and a reservoir capacity of 800,000 cubic meters, is poised to become a cornerstone of community development and sustainability.\nThe launch of the Maragua Bulk Water Supply and Irrigation Project marks a significant milestone in the battle against water scarcity in Murang'a South. By combining an impressive daily capacity with a comprehensive approach to both domestic use and irrigation, this initiative is set to revolutionize access to water in the region. With the government's additional financial support for last-mile connections, the project not only promises to alleviate the immediate water challenges but also to lay the foundation for a future where water scarcity is a thing of the past. As the community looks forward to a new era of prosperity and health, the narrative of struggle gives way to one of hope and resilience, heralding a brighter, more water-secure future for the residents of Murang'a South.",

    "title": "Victims ask Pope for independent inquiry into abuse by prominent priest",
    "text": "Former nuns who said they were subjected to sexual, psychological or spiritual abuse by a famous priest urged Pope Francis on Wednesday to allow an independent investigation, saying the Catholic Church had put up \"a rubber wall\" blocking the truth. Fr Marko Ivan Rupnik, a religious artist whose mosaics adorn about 200 churches and chapels around world, including in the Vatican, was expelled from the Jesuit order last year and is believed to be somewhere in his native Slovenia. About 20 people, mostly former nuns, have accused him of various types of abuse, either when he was a spiritual director of a community of nuns in Slovenia about 30 years ago or after he moved to Rome to pursue his career as an artist. He has not commented on the allegations, which the Jesuit Order said last year are \"very highly\" credible. Both the order, to which Pope Francis belongs, and the Vatican have launched internal investigations. Former nun Gloria Branciani said publicly for the first time on Wednesday that Rupnik had forced her to have three-way sex with him and another nun in Slovenia and had justified it as a devotion to the Holy Trinity. Later, in Rome, he forced her to visit pornographic movie theatres with him, she said. She and another alleged Rupnik victim, former nun Mirjam Kovac, urged the pope to commission what victims advocate Anne Barrett Doyle called \"an independent investigation of the hierarchy's handling of the allegations against Rupnik and to publish the findings\". Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a U.S.-based documentation centre on abuse in the Catholic Church, said the inquiry must \"include every superior who may have turned a blind eye from the early 1990s until now and most importantly it must address the troubling questions swirling around Francis' own role in this case\". Repeated attempts to reach Rupik, now 70, though his art studio in Rome have been unsuccessful. A Vatican spokesman declined to comment on Barrett Doyle's remarks. MYSTERIOUS LIFTING OF EXCOMMUNICATION Under pressure from the media, the Jesuits disclosed in 2022 that in 2020 the Vatican's doctrinal department had excommunicated Rupnik for \"absolution of an accomplice\", referring to when a priest has sex with someone and then absolves the person in confession. The excommunication was lifted after only a few weeks, an unusually short period, on the grounds that Rupnik had repented. Barrett Doyle said an independent inquiry should investigate if the pope had any influence on the decision. Last year the pope ordered the Vatican's doctrinal department to re-open the Rupnik case. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Wednesday that the department had concluded gathering information and was deciding how to proceed. Kovac, who said she suffered psychological but not sexual abuse from Rupnik, criticised the delay. \"We are saddened by the fact that (Church) institutions, instead of using our experience to re-think they way they handle such cases, continue to wrap themselves in silence, a silence we see as a rubber wall that bounces back every attempt to cure an unhealthy situation,\" she said. Branciani, now 60, said her complaints to the mother superior in Slovenia and a local bishop there were met with ridicule. Visibly shaken, she described Rupnik as a cult-like figure who \"entered my psyche\" and made her feel worthless unless she gave in to his demands. \"I was violated in body, soul, mind and spirit,\" she said. \"I hated what I had become and descended into self-disgust,\" she added, saying she had several times considered taking her own life.",

Dénonçant la violence des émeutiers qui \"ne se soucient pas de qui ils blessent\", il a scandé: \"Ce sont des fascistes nazis dégoûtants et nous devons tous leur trancher la gorge et nous débarrasser d’eux.\"\nRoyaume-Uni: la mobilisation antiraciste peut-elle mettre fin aux émeutes? 3:17 Une phrase qui n'a pas manqué de faire réagir les réseaux sociaux, la vidéo ayant été vue plusieurs millions de fois.
