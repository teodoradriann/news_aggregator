    "text": "Crisis Receiving Center in Henrico celebrates first year of free youth mental health support\nHENRICO, Va. (WWBT) - The Youth Crisis Receiving Center off Brook Road in Henrico County is celebrating its first anniversary.\nThe goal of the center is to help young people experiencing mental health crises.\nDirector of Crisis Services at St. Joseph’s Villa, Bob Larkin, says they serve youth aged 7 to 17 years old, and have already helped more than 150 youth avoid trips to emergency rooms.\nFamilies who wish to remain anonymous say the specialized help for their children has been invaluable.\n“She was having some thoughts of harming herself and others, and she communicated those thoughts a few different occasions, and including in writing,” one father said of his 10-year-old daughter.\nShe received treatment at the Youth Crisis Receiving Center a few weeks ago.\nWithout this resource, the E.R. is often the only other option, and that can be more traumatic for those already suffering.\n“They’re not set up to be nurturing for children,” Larkin said. “We see kids based on school bullying, pressures of school, social media. [Others] who are under pressure for sports, academics, college entrance, and they get overwhelmed. And then we’ve also seen kids on the other side that have long-standing mental health challenges, and that this just happens to be a safe place to come and kind of reset themselves.”\nLarkin says there are fewer than 10 youth crisis receiving centers in the country, and they have been able to help more than 80% of patients return home without needing a higher level of care.\n“A very quick triage assessment, a suicide assessment, and a nurse’s assessment. Once they’re deemed that they’re safe to be at our level, they also have a crisis assessment, and they get to get to see a psychiatrist through telehealth, and all that’s done within 23 hours,” Larkin said of the process.\nThe team consists of behavioral specialists, clinicians, and registered nurses.\nThanks to a grant and in partnership with Henrico County, all services are now free.\n“We have nursing 24 hours a day. We’re in operation 24 hours a day. We’re doing admissions from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day, and the staff is just incredible,” Larkin said.\n“My experience with them was absolutely amazing,” the father said. “They were compassionate, they were sensitive, they were understanding, they were encouraging.”\nAnother thing that families say they are grateful for is that there is no cap on the number of times a child can receive free mental health services and evaluations at the center.\nCopyright 2025 WWBT.

Lo scenario e la tendenza di Peppe Caridi 10 Mag 2024 | 18:36 La mappa sinottica per mercoledì 15 maggio evidenzia il ciclone atlantico che alimenterà forte maltempo sull'Italia MeteoWeb Maltempo senza sosta sull’Italia anche la prossima settimana. Gli ultimi aggiornamenti dei modelli prospettano uno scenario meteorologico estremo persistente sul nostro Paese anche tra 13 e 20 maggio , in modo particolare (ma non solo) sulle Regioni del Nord. Un’altra vasta, estesa e stazionaria perturbazione atlantica posizionata tra Irlanda e Bretagna alimenterà un flusso caldo-umido nel Mediterraneo centrale e quindi un’area di convergenza molto pericolosa a ridosso delle Alpi.\nProprio l’area alpina sarà la più esposta ai fenomeni meteo estremi, che inizieranno già lunedì 13 maggio e poi si intensificheranno martedì 14 e mercoledì 15 . Avremo ogni giorno forti temporali che provocheranno violenti nubifragi, piogge torrenziali e fenomeni meteo estremi con grandine e inondazioni. Anche al Centro/Sud avremo instabilità diffusa con temporali, fronti freddi che si alterneranno a risalite calde prefrontali cariche di nubi di sabbia giallastra proveniente dal Sahara.\nNei prossimi bollettini meteo di MeteoWeb, tutti gli aggiornamenti giorno per giorno e Regione per Regione. La primavera continua – anche quest’anno – nel segno del maltempo. METEO Allerta Meteo, ecco il grande Ciclone che provocherà il maltempo della prossima settimana",

What was THAT?\nHere we were tip-toeing our way through May , acclimating to the weekly upward nudges on Mother Nature's thermostat, and out of nowhere, she delivers a mid-August punch just to let us know who's boss.\nMid-90s? In early May? There should be a law!\nYou have to wonder what our newer Floridians think on days like this. Back home it's probably barely touching 70, and now they're dealing with the doubleheader threat of heat stroke and sunburn. Rethinking that Poughkeepsie exodus, Earl?\nRIG UP Pompano season means pompano rigs, which aren't just for pompano. True story\nNot to worry (much), we're supposed to normalize over the weekend with high temps remaining around low-80s sanity levels. But we're getting to the time of year when you really gotta love fishing to battle our unique elements — the good news: those afternoon thunderstorms will cool things down a bit.\nBut you'll still get out there, of course. As the underrated Mark Chestnutt crooned some 30 years ago: \"It's too hot to fish, too hot for golf, and too cold at home.\"\nMeanwhile, before the roundup, let's stay in the Way Back Machine and ask Johnny Carson just how hot it was today ...\n\"It was so hot, I saw a cop chasing a robber and they were BOTH walking.\"\n\"So hot, I saw a fire hydrant flag down a dog.\"\n🎶 Well it sure feels good to come in here,\nAnd just pull up a seat.\nA frosty mug of a cool one,\nHelps to beat the heat.\nThese old dog days of summer,\nLord, I'll be glad when they're gone.\nIt's too hot to fish, and too hot for golf,\nAnd too cold at home.🎶\n—Mark Chestnutt, Too…\n— Texas Darlin' 🎀 🏈 (@TexitDarling) April 14, 2024 Halifax/Indian River Unless the drive-by heat wave chased them away, you might still find a pompano dipping its toes into the river. It’s also time for jacks to start turning up their aggression, as if they weren’t already quite maniacal.\nAll of the above means it’s time to make sure you’re familiar with the differences between the prized pompano and its less tasty, low-foreheaded cousin. The physical similarities include a propensity for avoiding boats, docks and shorelines, and they’ll both fight like hell to make that known.\nBest description I’ve seen in differentiating these two fish involves their eyes. The jack looks like he just left a snorting session with a hair band, while the pomp’s carefree gaze suggest he just stepped away from Willie Nelson’s tour bus.\nMeanwhile, “the river has been producing some big jacks, up to 10 pounds, and that’s been fun,” says Capt. Jeff Patterson ( Pole Dancer charter ).\n“The docks have been good for reds, snook and seatrout,” he adds. “The inlet has been slow for me. We saw some tarpon but couldn’t get them to play. I’ve caught some blues but that’s about it.”\nEarly birds are finding nice-sized trout in Southeast Volusia (SeVo?), in the backwaters throughout Edgewater and Oak Hill.\nTo the north, Ike Leary is seeing mangrove snapper and black drum come to the planks at the Granada pier near the bridge.\nFarther north, up around Highbridge, Jeff Muller ( Yellow Dawg bait shop) says they’ve been seeing some quality fish brought up on the river, with pompano and whiting highlighting the beachside catches.\nSharks have been spending more time than usual in the river, he adds, with the blacktip count reaching eight at one point.\nSurf “Pockets of pompano” is the highlight on the northernmost beaches in our area, where the water quality has been dicy.\n“Try north of an inlet to find some cleaner water and use a Carolina rig with a piece of shrimp in a trough for the black drum,” says Cathy Sanders ( Fishin’ Girl surf charter ). “Fresh dead shrimp and Fishgum have been the ticket for catching fish lately for me, and our red or green float rigs have been catching fish in spite of the conditions.”\nLive sandfleas and the sandflea-flavored Fishbites have been useful for Chris Mansfield ( Reel Healin’ Outdoors ), he says. A trip to Bethune Beach this week produced too many catfish, but he mixed in a 14-inch pompano.\nDid someone say pompano?\nClean water and good conditions, save for afternoon winds, in the Shores and Wilbur area, according to Marco Pompano , who sent along a picture of a monster pomp that nearly tipped out at 20 inches.\n“We grilled it up with some teriyaki. You would’ve loved it,” he says. Gee, thanks.\nYou’d think the ever-warming weather, even before this late-week death-ray, would’ve signaled the end of the northward pompano migration, but Marco has a gut feeling that says otherwise.\n“I truly believe the main load hasn’t arrived yet. Some people think it’s past us but I’m much more positive than that.”\nSt. Johns The panfish bite is still strong in numbers and a little variety — the specks are thick and the bluegill are apparently begging for attention.\n“They’re here and they’re on fire,” says Capt. Bryn Adams ( Highland Park Fish Camp ). “Live crickets and worms and even beetle spins work great. We’re targeting shoreline cover and tree tops along the Norris Dead River.”\nFor the specks, find deeper water.\n“Under docks and overhanging trees,” suggests Don McCormick, who reported a few tremendous outings this week, including a successful search for sunshine (aka hybrid) bass.\n“That bite is really good, also,” he says. “There’s plenty of bait in the river just about anywhere you go.”\nEducate yourself Capt. Jamie Thrappas operates a local fishing charter and owns a bait shop next to Highbridge, both of which wear the Yellow Dawg nameplate.\nHe’ll share much of what he’s learned from his 18 years of local fishing at this month’s meeting and seminar at the Halifax Sport Fishing Club, next Thursday (May 16). Capt. Jamie’s presentation will start about 7:30 p.m., after some club business.\nMore info on the website.\nHook, line and clicker: Send us your fish pics We want to see your most recent catch. Email your fish photos to ken.willis@news-jrnl.com.\nPlease include first and last name of angler(s), as well as type of fish (we're occasionally stumped). All are included with our online fishing report, and some occasionally make the print edition.\nDo I need a fishing license? You can find all the license info, including exemptions, on Florida's Fish and Wildlife Commission website: MyFWC.com. But the basics are: No: If you're 65 or older, 15 or younger, you don't need a license. “ Probably” Not: If you're fishing with a licensed guide or charter boat, both of which often purchase commercial licenses that cover their customers. Yes: Most everyone else, including visitors from other states. Yes: Even if you're a shore-based angler (shoreline, dock, pier, bridge, etc.), and even if fishing with a shore-based guide. However: The shore-based license is free . . . But: You still need to register for that free license.\nWhere do I get a license and what does it cost? Many bait shops sell licenses, as do the bigger retailers (Bass, Dick's, Walmart, etc.). Florida's FWC uses a third-party site for buying or renewing fishing licenses: GoOutdoorsFlorida.com. The cost : $17 for an annual license. Don't forget: Whether you're fishing fresh or saltwater, you need the specific license. Freshwater and saltwater licenses are both $17 annually.\nI’m here on vacation, do I need a license? Yes you do, and they're also available at GoOutdoorsFlorida.com or certain bait shops and big retailers. Cost: $17 for three days, $30 for seven days, $47 for a year. Also: Non-residents need to purchase that license even if they're just fishing from shoreline or shore-based structures. (Florida residents need that license, too, but they're free.)\n ",

    "text": "The Democratic National Committee unveiled their first paid advertising calling out Trump for being a convicted felon Thursday, and they put it only miles from a Trump campaign rally. The billboard, paid for by the DNC, says &quot;Trump already attacked Arizona&#039;s democracy once. Now he&#039;s back as a convicted felon. He&#039;s out for revenge and retribution. Trump: unfit to serve.&quot; The billboard is facing southbound traffic on I-17, a major freeway through the center of Phoenix, only seven miles from the Dream City Church where Trump is holding a &quot;Chase the Vote&quot; rally with anti-Martin Luther King activist Charlie Kirk and his Turning Point USA organization. Google Maps DNC Deputy Communications Director Abhi Rahman said in a statement: As president, Donald Trump and his MAGA minions systematically attacked Arizonans’ rights. Now, the threat Trump poses to Arizonans’ democracy, economy, and safety has never been greater. If Trump, now a convicted felon, wins in November, he pledges to be a dictator ‘on day one’ in order to implement his agenda of revenge and retribution: stoking political violence while attacking Arizonans’ reproductive and democratic rights. That’s why Arizonans will reject Trump in November and again unite behind President Biden and Vice President Harris to defend democracy and deliver for Arizona families. The Biden-Harris campaign called Trump a convicted felon for the first time in a post on X earlier this week.",

    "text": "Sky will reduce its headcount with its customer call centres by 2,000 as the media group moves its service further towards online and artificial intelligence.\nCall centres in Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds will be closed, while another two, in Newcastle and Dunfermline, will be scaled back.\nSky previously polled 10,000 customers who responded by saying they wanted flexibility in how they interacted with the company. Significantly, the majority of people preferred digital tools for everyday tasks such as paying a bill or managing a contract. It will still be possible to speak to a person to resolve technical issues.\nAbout seven out of ten customers said being able to reach the company 24/7, be that via phone, email, live chat and apps, was important.\nStaff were notified of the changes on Thursday morning, which will be subject to consultation.\nIs anticipated that calls to Sky’s contact centres will drop from 25 million each year to about 17 million by 2029.\nInstead, Sky is making a multi-million pound investment in a state-of-the-art Livingston campus, where it will establish a Centre of Excellence for customer service\nA Sky spokesperson said: “We’re transforming our business to deliver quicker, simpler, and more digital customer service. Our customers increasingly want choice, to speak to us on the phone when they need us most and the ease of managing everyday tasks digitally.\n“We’re investing in a new centre of excellence for customer service, alongside cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable, and available 24/7. This is about building a future-ready Sky that continues to put our customers and their needs first.”\nIn January, it was announced Sky would shed 1,000 jobs from its dish installation business, largely due to the shift towards its online Sky Stream and Sky Glass products.\nAccording to Ofcom, Sky has been the least complained-about telecoms provider in the UK for 13 consecutive years.",

    "title": "Protest In Bangladesh Took Unexpected Paths: India Remains In A Quandary – OpEd",
    "text": "The factors that induced and precipitated the political turmoil that Bangladesh has witnessed leading the leader of the Awami League party Sheikh Hasina to flee the country and subsequent killings of more than 400 people and efforts by the protesters to sabotage the statue of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who played a pivotal role in the country’s freedom struggle and attempts to set houses and temples of Hindus at fire are not still very clear.\nThe students agitation began in June this year in a form of peaceful protest when the High Court of Bangladesh reinstated the reservation system by reversing the government order of 2018 which already had scrapped the controversial quota system that reserved 30 percent of jobs for families of veterans who fought in the 1971 Liberation War.\nOn July 21, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh struck down the June ruling by the High Court and significantly reduced quota for freedom fighters’ descendants by limiting it to mere 5 percent. In spite of this substantive reductions in the controversial reservation system and the fact that it was the High Court not the Hasina government which reinstated the reservation for the family members of war veterans, the protest rather turned more violent bent on a regime change.\nThe sudden surge in violence blowing out of proportions in the small South Asian country on an issue where the government did not have a direct role leads to a conspiracy theory that the entire episode of violence might have been propped up by external actors.\nNonetheless, there were growing anti-regime undercurrents as the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), the main political opposition of Awami League boycotted the general elections of this year alleging that democracy has been sabotaged in the country through practices such as electoral fraud, intimidation and widespread rigging whereas the Awami League and its allies won 225 of 300 parliamentary seats formed the government. Indicating an increase in the anti-democratic tide in the country, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that nearly 10,000 activists were arrested after an opposition rally turned violent on 28 October last year, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 people and injuring more than 5,500.\nThe US has also placed sanctions on the elite Rapid Action Battalion of Bangladesh over disappearances and extrajudicial killings. These feelings of political alienation and persecution among the opposition along with putative external support and indoctrination might have influenced the protest to take this shape. Meanwhile, an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will lead the country from this turmoil.\nHowever, the small South Asian country which was known as one of the poorest countries in the South Asian region demonstrated remarkable economic growth under the leadership of Hasina since 2009 when she came to power and remained at the helm until the recent political upheaval. The South Asian country came to be acknowledged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the region by lifting 25 million people out of poverty in the last 20 years showing better economic indicators than those of India. For instance, its GDP per capita has exceeded that of India’s since 2018 even while the country’s economy has been in recovery mode since the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIndia Remains Uncomfortable Bangladesh is located on the cusp of South and Southeast Asia and figures prominently in India’s eastward march. Thus, success of India’s act east policy would largely hinge on the country’s forging of successful ties with Bangladesh.\nThe small South Asian country is bound by India to the north, east and west that makes it better connected to India in terms of rail, road, waterways, sea and air compared to any other neighbour. Due to its location as a bridge between South and Southeast Asia, Bangladesh has been a lynchpin to India’s sub-regional initiatives such as BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal Initiative (BBIN) and Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar initiative (BCIM). Bangladesh is not only India’s largest trade partner in South Asia, migration and people-to-people contacts make the bilateral relations more organic.\nIn the energy sector, both countries have robust ties and the countries have also signed many bilateral agreements new areas such as space, information technology, electronics, cybersecurity, and civil nuclear energy among others.\nNew Delhi considers Dhaka a strategic link between mainland India and the northeastern states given that these states being landlocked it is through Bangladesh that they find a quick outlet to the sea. Stability in the Northeastern states, five of which share border with Bangladesh depended on the smooth bilateral relationship between India and Bangladesh.\nThe small South Asian country has been cautious enough to keep the Pakistani and Chinese influence at bay so as not to raise India’s security concerns. However, the unexpected shifts in the political sands of the country put India in a quandary as to how to respond to the changing dynamics and maintain future bilateral ties.",
