    "text": "Se le opposizioni sono sul piede di guerra, cercando di cavalcare il caso Almasri, la maggioranza si muove compatta nel respingere le accuse in virtù di una sottintesa ragione di Stato; il Guardasigilli Nordio dalla Versiliana si dice \"sereno\" e \"rispettoso delle decisioni del Tribunale dei ministri. Quello che dovevo dire l'ho detto in Parlamento\". E sulla possibilità di dimissioni in caso di rinvio a giudizio dallo staff sono categorici: \"Il ministro non si dimetterà. Ma quali dimissioni!\". Ma è il terremoto giudiziario esploso a Milano e che ha investito il sistema urbanistico del capoluogo meneghino, toccando il Pd, a dominare l'attualità politica. Il ministro dichiara al giornalista del Giornale Stefano Zurlo \"di aver appreso i fatti mentre era in viaggio\" e \"di non poter entrare nel merito della questione\" ma ci tiene a precisare: \"Per alcune di queste persone è stato chiesto l'arresto: carcerazione o domiciliari. Senza la riforma voluta dal governo Meloni qualche anno fa, queste persone sarebbero in carcere. Noi invece abbiamo invertito i ruoli proprio per enfatizzare la presunzione di innocenza\". \"La nostra riforma\", dichiara orgoglioso, \"prevede: prima ti interrogo poi, se questo interrogatorio non convince allora scatta la misura cautelare\".\nDal Senato, mentre il ministro si stava recando in Toscana, si aggiungeva un altro tassello nel percorso di approvazione della riforma della giustizia, ormai alle ultime battute finali. \"È stata sofferta perché ha trovato un'opposizione ferrea della magistratura. Ma ce la stiamo facendo. Ci sarà una seconda lettura tra settembre, ottobre, novembre e poi un referendum che dovrebbe svolgersi in primavera\". \"Il primo vero obiettivo\", dice l'ex magistrato, \"è che se la separazione è il titolo della riforma, il vero nocciolo duro sta nel fatto che viene riformato il CSM con la creazione di un'Alta Corte disciplinare che mette fine alla giustizia di famiglia\". E sull'accusa delle opposizioni che il PM diventi strumenti del potere esecutivo è netto: \"Continuerà ad essere libero e indipendente. La separazione delle carriere esiste in vari ordinamenti, dall'America alla Francia. Gli attacchi delle opposizioni sono gratuite forme di provocazione polemica da rispedire al mittente\". E attacca: \"Hanno paura ma la faremo!\". La platea condivide e applaude. Incalzato da Zurlo, il ministro tende però anche la mano ai magistrati affermando che \"per merito della magistratura la giustizia civile si sta allineando ai livelli europei mancano ancora due, tre anni\". Un risultato importante dal momento che i processi civili pesano sull'economia circa il 2% del Pil. Il finale del Guardasigilli è incentrato su due fatti che tornano a dominare nel tempo il dibattito pubblico: il caso Garlasco con il suo uso processo mediatico e il sovraffollamento delle carceri. Nel primo caso il ministro parla di \"diretti interessati esposti ad una gogna virtuale con una palese violazione dei diritti civili che non sarebbe mai avvenuta nel mondo anglosassone\". Tra le possibili misure da varare il ministro si tira fuori in quanto titolare del dicastero della Giustizia ma invita il Parlamento a prendere come esempio il \"disprezzo della legge\" o \"contempt of court\". Una misura inglese per tutelare l'integrità del sistema giudiziario. Nel secondo caso, cita i circa 10.000 detenuti che potrebbero avere una pena alternativa e ribadisce che \"non si tratta di una liberazione anticipata\" ma si baseranno esclusivamente sull'applicazione della legge già esistente.\nNel salutarlo, il giornalista gli chiede se resterà a Via Arenula qualora la Meloni vincesse di nuovo le elezioni. Ma riesce giusto a strappargli un sorriso e una battuta telegrafica: \"Non è mai successo nella storia che un Guardasigilli succeda a se stesso\".\nnetiquette.\nQuile norme di comportamento per esteso.",

    "title": "Urwerk reinvents its signature complication in stingingly fun fashion with the UR-150 Scorpion",
    "text": "Urwerk reinvents its iconic satellite hours complication with the most ambitious retrograde system it’s devised yet. As the hour hand reaches 60, the retrograde hand makes a 240° jump and the hour satellites rotate 270°. Despite its complexity, it’s one of the most compact models in Urwerk’s current range. Horological provocateurs Urwerk have drawn from myriad inspirations for their unconventional timepieces : 1950s sports cars, medieval knight’s armour, 2001: A Space Odyssey , the Lockheed SR-71 “Blackbird” spy plane… Some of their most avant-garde pieces, however, have drawn upon the natural world for their inspiration, such as the UR-103T Tarantula, UR-202 Hammerhead, UR-100 T-Rex or the UR-CC1 King Cobra – all named after dangerous animals. Urwerk revives this tradition in 2024 with the UR-150 Scorpion, which presents a new take on the brand’s signature satellite hours that does indeed evoke a scorpion’s lighting-fast sting.\n“We’ve once again chosen an evocative nickname for our creation and the scorpion is indeed a nasty beast – yet the design of the UR-150 is gentle,” Felix Baumgartner, Urwerk co-founder and master watchmaker explains. “It’s very Urwerk… the aggressive symbolism belies the reality of the watch’s cool, calm personality.” Indeed, despite its vicious name, the UR-150 Scorpion debuts a more organic, svelter design language for the brand. “It’s an evolutionary process,” says Urwerk’s other co-founder and creative director, Martin Frei. “We like to play with lines and enjoy juxtaposing gentle curves with acute angles. Here, the profile of the case and sapphire crystal is a section of the same shape – meaning perfectly spherical – while the hand shares exactly the same curve.”\nSo, what makes the UR-150 Scorpion so exciting? In short, not only does it feature a much bigger and more ambitious retrograde seconds arc – moving from the brand’s usual 120 degrees to a 240° arc – but it also features a more complex take on the brand’s satellite hours. As the minute/hour hand hits 60, the retrograde hand makes a 240° jump and the hour satellites simultaneously rotate 270°. Some scorpion strikes are as fast as 130cm/second – the UR-150 Scorpion’s retrograde action is similarly rapid.\nUrwerk has presented Satellite collection watches with retrograde minutes displays like this before, but none that travel across such a big arc. The fact the hour satellites also rotate (across an even bigger arc than the hand) really sets the UR-150 Scorpion apart from previous models, and provides an even greater sense of visual drama. It’s very fun.\nTo necessitate these dramatic rotations, Urwerk has ditched the typical Maltese cross mechanism (also called a “Geneva drive”) they use in basically all their Satellite models’ movements for a cam and rack system in order to handle the intense speed and inertia these displays generate as well as to maintain isochronism. Urwerk relates that the UR-150 Scorpion’s UR-50.01 movement boasts the heaviest weights they’ve ever utilised in one of their calibres and that it also features a speed regulator fitted to its flywheel – a mechanism usually employed to regulate the chiming sequence on a minute repeater – which smooths the return of the retrograde hand.\nAnother cool feature of the UR-150 Scorpion’s movement is that its automatic rotor features two turbines, which are designed to work as subtle brakes for the rotor, regulating its speed, as well as absorbing shocks. They also look pretty badass, making the UR-150 Scorpion a treat to behold from both the front and the back. Despite the power demands of its complication, the UR-50.01 has a 43-hour power reserve and beats at 4Hz.\nDespite the UR-150 Scorpion’s complexity, it actually represents one of the most compact models in Urwerk’s current range, with a diameter of just under 42.5mm. The curved design of its case, which hugs the wrist, also helps it wear smaller than it might appear. Perhaps the most interesting part of its case design is its crystal, which is extremely domed, with the case and crystal seamlessly extending from the curve of the bracelet along the same arc. Frei explains that as the satellites and hours hand share the same sloping profile, this lets you read the time without having to twist your wrist.\nTwo variants of the UR-150 Scorpion will be available at launch: a “Titan” model which has a sandblasted titanium and steel case – Urwerk’s signature look – as well as a “Dark” model which adds an anthracite PVD coating for a stealthier look. Both feature red and green highlights, with the Titan sporting a green-tipped hand and the Dark a red-tipped hand. Both also come mounted on integrated black rubber woven-effect straps, which resemble the armoured abdomen of a scorpion. Call it a sting in the tale.\nUrwerk UR-150 Scorpion pricing & availability The Urwerk UR-150 Scorpion is a limited edition of 100 pieces, split between 50 Titan models and 50 Dark models.

    "text": "Bangladesh opens mosque for transgender hijra community\nKicked out of other prayer services, members of Bangladesh’s transgender hijra community have been welcomed at a new mosque in the Muslim-majority nation with the promise of worship without discrimination.\nThe humble structure — a single-room shed with walls and a roof clad in tin — is a new community hub for the minority, who have enjoyed greater legal and political recognition in recent years but still suffer from entrenched prejudice.\n“From now on, no one can deny a hijra from praying in our mosque,” community leader Joyita Tonu said in a speech to the packed congregation.\n“No one can mock us,” added the visibly emotional 28-year-old, a white scarf covering her hair.\nThe mosque near Mymensingh, north of the capital Dhaka on the banks of the Brahmaputra river, was built on land donated by the government after the city’s hijra community were expelled from an established congregation.\n“I never dreamt I could pray at a mosque again in my lifetime,” said Sonia, 42, who as a child loved to recite the Koran and studied at an Islamic seminary.\nBut when she came out as hijra, as transgender women in South Asia are commonly known, she was blocked from praying in a mosque.\n“People would tell us: ‘Why are you hijra people here at the mosques? You should pray at home. Don’t come to the mosques,'” Sonia, who uses only one name, told AFP.\n“It was shameful for us, so we didn’t go,” she added. “Now, this is our mosque. Now, no one can say no.”\n– ‘Like any other people’ –\nHijra have been the beneficiaries of growing legal recognition in Bangladesh, which since 2013 has officially allowed members of the community to identify as a third gender.\nSeveral have entered Bangladeshi politics, with one transgender woman elected mayor of a rural town in 2021.\nBut hijra still struggle for basic recognition and acceptance, lacking property and marriage rights.\nThey are also often discriminated against in employment and are much more likely to be victims of violent crime and poverty than the average Bangladeshi.\nHardline Islamist groups have also lashed out at the recognition of transgender Bangladeshis in school textbooks, leading rallies to demand the government abandon its push to include them in the curriculum.\nMufti Abdur Rahman Azad, founder of a hijra charity, told AFP that the new mosque was the first of its kind in the country.\nA similar endeavour planned in another city was stopped last month after a protest by locals, he added.\nDozens of local hijra women donated time and money to build the Dakshin Char Kalibari Masjid for the Third Gender, which opened this month.\nIt also has a graveyard, after a local Muslim cemetery last year refused to bury a young hijra woman inside its grounds.\nThe mosque’s imam, Abdul Motaleb, 65, said that the persecution of the hijra community was against the teachings of his faith.\n“They are like any other people created by Allah”, the cleric told AFP.\n– ‘No one can be denied’ –\n“We all are human beings. Maybe some are men, some are women, but all are human. Allah revealed the Holy Koran for all, so everyone has the right to pray, no one can be denied.”\nMotaleb said that other Bangladeshis could learn from the faith and strength of the hijra.\n“Since I have been here at this mosque, I have been impressed by their character and deeds,” he said.\nThe new mosque is already tackling prejudice. Local resident Tofazzal Hossain, 53, has offered Friday prayers there for a second week in a row.\nHe said living and praying with the hijra community has changed his “misconceptions” about them.\n“When they started to live with us, many people said many things,” he told AFP.\n“But we’ve realised what people say isn’t right. They live righteously like other Muslims”.\nTonu hopes to expand the simple mosque to be big enough to cater for more people.\n“God willing, we will do it very soon,” she told AFP.\n“Hundreds of people can offer prayers together.“\nAFP",

    "text": "By Grace Snelling 2 minute Read For Tyler Huggins, CEO and cofounder of the animal-free protein company Meati, the key to creating sustainable food products is all around us—stored in thousands of years of natural history.\nTyler Huggins [Photo: Meati] “My philosophy and my approach has always been if you have a problem, look into nature,” Huggins says. “Get billions of years of evolution solving problems, and there’s probably a solution in nature already there. We just have to listen and learn.”\nOn this week’s Leaders in Innovation podcast , Huggins explains how his team has used that learning process to build a product that’s natural, scalable, and capable of making a difference in the climate crisis. At Meati, that started with a core mission: “We founded this company with the sole purpose of having a net positive impact on the world, and we mean that,” Huggins says. “When we built out the approach, we reverse engineered it and said, ‘Alright, if the goal is global impact, what does that actually mean? What are the first principles that are required in order to do so?’”\nThe company found that they would need to address consumer demand for a nutritious (yet equally delicious) faux meat product, while keeping production cost-effective. That’s where nature came in. Huggins identified the mycelium mushroom—a fungus that has been used by humans as a fermenting agent for thousands of years—as a source of protein that could meet those criteria. Unlike some plant-based alternatives, the rootlike structure of the mycelium mushroom has a texture that closely mimics meat. It’s also over 60% protein by weight and highly nutrient-dense. To reach a large customer base, and especially the vast majority of people who still incorporate animal meat in their diets, Huggins says it’s important for Meati products to look and taste familiar.\n[Photo: Meati] “I think you have to be careful on how many new things you introduce all at one time,” Huggins says. “If we really want to create change, you have to do things differently. The way we’re doing it now is not working. Our food production system is not sustainable, so we need new innovation, but how much innovation can you introduce at one time? I would argue not much.”\nPerhaps most crucially, Huggins says that mycelium meat alternative production could ultimately reach “unmatched efficiency” compared to animal products. Meati is already producing millions of pounds annually from its ranch facility, and has expanded through partnerships with Sprouts Farmers Market, Whole Foods, Meijer, and Fresh Thyme. Huggins hopes that Meati’s efforts will pave the way for other companies to look at nature as a partner in combating the climate crisis.\n“Fighting nature and having to do things that it doesn’t want to do is very difficult,” Huggins says. “So the easiest thing is to find parts of nature that have that intrinsic, inherent capabilities that we want, and leverage them to help solve our problems. That’s what we’ve been able to do that I think is different than the bulk of our agricultural and food system.”\nadvertisement Listen to the full conversation between Tyler Huggins and James Vincent on this week’s Leaders in Innovation podcast.\n Subscribe on Apple Podcasts , Stitcher, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.",

    "text": "WOODSTOCK, CT ( WFSB /Gray News) - Fourteen puppies were rescued from a rollover crash that closed a road in Woodstock, Connecticut Thursday morning. Several fire agencies responded to Senexet Road between Laurel and Bull Hill roads for a single-vehicle rollover accident involving wires down. Firefighters found a pole that had snapped, with wires down, and called Eversource CT to disable the power. Power was out in the area while the electricians worked. Officials say minor injuries were originally reported, but no one ended up being hurt. First responders also rescued and provided care for 14 puppies at the scene. the Muddy Brook Fire Department shared photos on Facebook of firefighters interacting with the puppies. The Necogg Humane Society and a doctor from Peake Brook Veterinary Center responded to the scene to provide veterinary care and shelter to the animals, firefighters said.

    "text": "Javier Fernández admite un posible \"agravio comparativo\" pero asegura que sus reivindicaciones serán incluidas en la nueva VPT\nSEVILLA, 27 (EUROPA PRESS)\nLa Diputación de Sevilla, gobernada por el socialista Javier Fernández, ha aprobado este jueves en su pleno ordinario de marzo una modificación en materia de su personal propio, marcada por una protesta de los técnicos de administración especial e ingenieros de la institución, de nuevo en demanda de mejoras laborales merced a la \"responsabilidad\" que ostentan en los proyectos de obra.\nRecordemos que en el pleno de noviembre de 2024, este colectivo de técnicos de administración especial, arquitectos, arquitectos técnicos e ingenieros industriales o topógrafos, que en total suman unas 70 u 80 personas de la plantilla de la Diputación, protagonizaban ya una protesta inicial avisando de que sienten que su trabajo no se ve \"reconocido ni remunerado\" con relación a las \"funciones y responsabilidades\" asumidas.\nY es que estos profesionales afrontan \"al menos diez años de responsabilidad civil y penal por cada proyecto o dirección facultativa\" que firman, pero carecen de complementos de los que sí disfrutan los técnicos de administración general; con lo que reclamaban unas condiciones y remuneración \"acordes a la responsabilidad, complejidad y peligrosidad\" de sus funciones.\nEste mismo colectivo ha protagonizado una nueva protesta en el pleno ordinario de este jueves, con motivo de una modificación promovida por el Gobierno local del PSOE respecto a la plantilla de la institución.\nCUESTIÓN DE \"CATEGORÍA\"\nAl respecto, los portavoces de este colectivo laboral de la Diputación, Eva Hornillo y Jorge Gómez, han explicado a Europa Press que el motivo de la protesta radicaba en que la citada modificación en el área de personal implica \"hacer extensivos a los encargados de obras de unos complementos de responsabilidad y disponibilidad anteriormente aprobados\" para los capataces; sin incluir a los técnicos de administración especial e ingenieros pese que los mismos cuentan con una \"categoría\" superior y vienen reclamando esta misma medida \"desde hace ya más de un año\".\nAsí, han reivindicado su petición de mejora de sus emolumentos, como \"responsables del principio y final de la cadena de trabajo\" de las obras de la Diputación y responsables \"reales\" de los proyectos de obra. \"Somos los que firmamos, somos los que determinamos qué hay que hacer y los que revisamos\", han defendido.\nDurante el debate plenario, tanto el grupo del PP como el de Con Andalucía, este último unido al PSOE por un acuerdo de gobernabilidad para el mandato, han reclamado dejar sobre la mesa este punto al ahondar en \"desigualdades\" en la plantilla de la Diputación y no haber \"paz social\"; mientras el diputado socialista de Empleado Público, Francisco Toajas, defendía que el asunto venía avalado por \"cuatro sindicatos\" de la institución para avanzar en una demanda derivada de que los encargados de obra habrían sufrido el \"olvido\" en la última modificación laboral.\nSOLUCIONAR UNA \"SITUACIÓN DE INJUSTICIA\"\nEl presidente de la Diputación ha intervenido además, avisando de que \"dejar el punto encima de la mesa sería incumplir un acuerdo de la mesa general de negociación\" con el apoyo de cuatro sindicatos, para solucionar \"la flagrante situación de injusticia en la que se encontraban los encargados de obra\".\nDestacando que aunque la medida pueda suponer \"un agravio comparativo\", lo cierto es que \"no perjudica a nadie\", Javier Fernández ha defendido la aprobación de este punto, explicando que las peticiones de los técnicos de administración especial e ingenieros \"tienen mucha viabilidad para poder ser atendidas\" en la nueva valoración de puestos de trabajo (VPT), cuya redacción ya ha sido encargada.\nPor eso, el presidente ha pedido \"calma\" a este colectivo laboral, lanzando un mensaje de \"tranquilidad\", tras lo cual la propuesta ha sido aprobada con su propio voto de calidad, a cuenta del doble empate a 15 votos surgido entre el apoyo del PSOE y el rechazo del PP y Con Andalucía, pues el diputado de Vox no ha asistido por motivos de salud.",

    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says.\nThe church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C.\nThe covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school.\nMiller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C.\n\"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said.\nThe covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said.\n\"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\"\nChief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing.\nCasimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\"\n\"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said.\nThe nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites.\nSince then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996.\nIn many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death.\nThe children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse.\nThe agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school.\nCasimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",
