    "title": "IDC Smart Cities Awards: Edge Computing is Helping Virginia Beach Tackle its Flooding Crisis",
    "text": "In remote and disaster-prone areas, the rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new vistas for emergency management and community safety in smart cities. These leading IoT deployments, highlighted at the recent announcement of the IDC Smart Cities Awards winners, solidified the role that edge computing is going to play in realizing some of the most important smart city projects of the era. The yearly IDC Smart Cities North America Awards showcase some of the most innovative use cases & deployments for smart city technology on the continent, including the use AI-powered and edge computing-dependent IoT projects tackling different slices of the smart city ecosystem, from civic engagement, to public health, to transformation, and more. One of the standout winners included a flood resiliency initiative in Virginia Beach, VA. FloodVISION-AI, a cutting-edge project in Virginia aimed at enhancing flood resilience, was made a winner at the IDC Smart Cities Awards for its innovative approach to water management. This initiative, part of the broader StormSense Project , employs machine learning to interpret water levels from advanced 4K web cameras with infrared capabilities, set up in 2022. The deployment of these cost-effective and energy-efficient sensors marks a significant advancement in water level sensing, complementing the active sensors maintained by USGS and NOAA. Critical to the success of this project was the use of edge computing solutions, which are allowing for data processing to be done close to where data is collected, including in extremely rugged environments and use cases like flood monitoring. What makes this IDC Smart Cities Awards winning project and its use of IoT ecosystems such a success? How important will edge computing be, especially at the rugged edge, in these types of environmental insights projects for successful smart cities? Iain Murray, Ph.D. , a pioneer and leading researcher in the field of IoT, and a John Curtin Distinguished Professor at the School of EECMS at Curtain University , explains why, for these kinds of mission critical operations in rugged environments, constant uptime to perform critical computations and make decisions in real-time without needing a continuous connection to the cloud is so paramount. “Having the processing at the edge, absolutely crucial in disaster management where you can lose internet, but also crucial in many other instances where we have unreliable or very low bandwidth connections,” Murray said.

    "text": "They’re seeing what no human has seen before. The first civilian astronauts to orbit Earth’s polar region revealed the breathtaking view of the gleaming “pure white” tundra in the first-ever video taken from space during their historic SpaceX mission. The stunning footage, taken early Wednesday morning by four spacefarers aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, captured the desolate snow-covered landscape of Antarctica as the Fram2 crew admired the tranquil scenery roughly 285 miles above the world’s southernmost and least-populated continent. “Hello, Antarctica,” Chinese-born crypto billionaire Chun Wang, 43, posted on X with a six-minute video of the vivid landmass, during which his fellow travelers congratulated him for the groundbreaking achievement. “Unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.” SpaceX launches first-ever crewed mission to orbit North and South poles: ‘Enjoy the views’ At one point in the video, Wang put his sock-covered feet on the spacecraft’s domed cupola window and started walking up and down with the bright, cloudy and powdery landscape floating in the background. “We call it a spacewalk,” he quipped, causing the crew to erupt in laughter. The crew shared a brief video of the frigid polar ice caps early Tuesday morning shortly after blasting off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida Monday night . They have since documented various parts of their exploration, including floating in the space capsule and chatting about the “desert” ice mass. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has since praised the space explorers on social media as “the first astronauts to orbit the poles.” NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 astronauts Hague, Williams and Wilmore address media Hello, Antarctica.\nUnlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible. pic.twitter.com/i7JawFYzW2 No human has ever traveled directly over the Earth’s poles from space, a trip that requires far more fuel than the usual flight paths that follow closer to the equator. The Fram2 will aim to circle Earth at a trajectory that is exactly 90 degrees to the equator, giving the passengers a perfect view of the North and South Poles that have remained elusive from even the astronauts on the International Space Station , which flies at about 51.6 degrees. None of the passengers aboard the Fram2 mission has ever been to space before. “The ride to orbit was much smoother than I had anticipated,” Wang, who funded the mission, said in an X post Wednesday morning. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER “Apart from the final minute before SECO, I barely felt any G-forces–it honestly felt like just another flight. I had imagined it would feel like being in an elevator that suddenly drops, but that sensation never came,” he said, referring to the Second-Stage Engine Cutoff. “If I hadn’t set free Tyler, the polar bear zero-gravity indicator, I might not have realized we were already weightless.” Wang, who lives in Malta, said the first few hours in orbit caused the crew to experience an uncomfortable wave of nausea and vomiting that left their stomachs uneasy as they dealt with a bout of motion sickness. By the second morning, Wang said he felt “completely refreshed” as the space explorers ate breakfast, took X-rays and started to marvel at the South Pole. Wang is joined by vehicle commander Jannicke Mikkelsen, of Norway; mission pilot Rabea Rogge, of Germany; and mission medical officer Eric Philips, of Australia; all hand-picked by the billionaire to fulfill his lifelong ambitions and curiosity of the polar regions. The spacecraft will fly around the globe for three to five days, with the crew set to complete 22 science experiments related to human physiology in orbit for researchers back on Earth. They are expected to splash down off the coast of California later this week. For top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.",

    "text": "Confirmado agora como o novo ano mais quente da história da humanidade , 2024 foi também o primeiro a ultrapassar a barreira de 1,5°C de aquecimento em relação aos níveis pré-industriais. Essa cifra é indicada por cientistas como o limite para conter as piores consequências das mudanças climáticas.\nDados do observatório Copernicus, da União Europeia, divulgados nesta sexta-feira (10) indicam que a temperatura média global no ano passado foi 1,6°C superior aos valores de 1850 a 1900, o parâmetro para os termômetros antes da emissão em larga escala de gases-estufa.\nLeia também\nListras do clima: Veja evolução das mudanças climáticas em linhas de crochê\nEm 2024, a temperatura média no planeta foi de 15,10°C, ficando 0,12°C acima do que foi registrado em 2023, o até então recordista de calor da série histórica. Também no Brasil 2024 bateu o ano anterior como o mais quente já computado, segundo o Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia), considerando medições desde 1961.\nIncêndio no pantanal perto de Miranda, em Mato Grosso do Sul, em agosto de 2024 - Lalo de Almeida - 6.ago.2024/Folhapress Os resultados indicam que a Terra segue em trajetória de rápido aquecimento, alimentado pela concentração recorde de CO 2 e de outros gases que ampliam o efeito estufa.\n\"Honestamente, eu estou já estou ficando sem metáforas para explicar o aquecimento que nós estamos vendo\", disse Carlo Buontempo, diretor do serviço de mudanças climáticas do Copernicus.\n\"O que apresentamos hoje não são nossas opiniões pessoais nem cálculos de modelos complexos. Estes são dados baseados em observações, milhões de observações, que mais uma vez nos dizem de forma inequívoca que o clima continua aquecendo\", completou o cientista durante a apresentação do relatório à imprensa.\nTodos os 366 dias de 2024 tiveram aquecimento acima de 1,25°C, enquanto três quartos deles superaram 1,5°C.\nAlém de ser o consenso científico para limitar as piores consequências das mudanças climáticas, como o fim de países insulares, o aquecimento de 1,5°C também é a meta preferencial pactuada pela comunidade internacional no Acordo de Paris, de 2015.\nEmbora considerem que o resultado seja um sinal de alerta, os pesquisadores europeus destacam que essa barreira ainda não foi definitivamente ultrapassada. Para isso, seriam necessárias duas décadas com temperaturas acima desse patamar.\nLeia também\n2024 supera 1,5°C de aquecimento da Terra e acende alerta climático\nAnálises de árvores, gelo e fósseis mostram que 2024 é o ano mais quente da história da humanidade\n\"Cada ano na última década está entre os dez mais quentes já registrados. Estamos agora à beira de ultrapassar o nível de 1,5°C definido no Acordo de Paris, e a média dos últimos dois anos já está acima desse nível\", pontuou Samantha Burgess, líder estratégica para o clima do Centro Europeu de Previsões Meteorológicas a Médio Prazo.\n\"Essas altas temperaturas globais, juntamente com níveis recordes de vapor d’água atmosférico em 2024, resultaram em ondas de calor e eventos de chuva intensa sem precedentes, causando sofrimento para milhões de pessoas\", completou.\nGráfico feito em crochê mostra aquecimento do planeta de 1940 a 2024 ic_save\nMais\nic_share\nLeia Mais Ícone fechar Voltar Ver novamente Voltar\nVoltar\nCompartilhe Ícone Facebook Facebook Ícone Whatsapp Whatsapp Ícone X\nX Ícone de messenger Messenger Ícone Linkedin Linkedin Ícone de envelope E-mail Ícone de link Cadeado representando um link Copiar link Ícone fechar Carregando...\nAlém do recorde nos termômetros, 2024 também foi marcado por números sem precedentes em outros indicadores.\nA quantidade total de vapor d’água na atmosfera chegou a níveis máximos, ficando cerca de 5% acima da média de 1991 a 2020. O resultado também foi 1% maior do que o registrado em 2016 e 2023, os recordistas anteriores.\nO relatório indica que esse suprimento abundante de umidade no ar contribuiu para ampliar o potencial de ocorrência de chuvas extremas. Combinado às altas temperaturas na superfície do mar, o cenário também foi favorável ao desenvolvimento de \"grandes tempestades, incluindo ciclones tropicais\".\nRelembre eventos climáticos extremos de 2024 ic_save\nMais\nic_share\nLeia Mais Ícone fechar Voltar Ver novamente Voltar\nVoltar\nCompartilhe Ícone Facebook Facebook Ícone Whatsapp Whatsapp Ícone X\nX Ícone de messenger Messenger Ícone Linkedin Linkedin Ícone de envelope E-mail Ícone de link Cadeado representando um link Copiar link Ícone fechar Carregando...\nPor todo o globo, houve ocorrências de eventos climáticos extremos, que foram desde grandes inundações até ondas de calor severo.\n\"Os muitos eventos recordes que vimos ao longo dos últimos 12 meses não são meras casualidades estatísticas, mas sim uma consequência direta do aquecimento generalizado do nosso sistema climático. Esse aquecimento é, em grande parte, impulsionado pelo aumento constante das concentrações atmosféricas de gases de efeito estufa\", disse Buontempo.\nAlém disso, a conjugação de temperaturas elevadas e alta umidade contribuiu para níveis elevados do chamado estresse térmico, que representa um grave risco à saúde. Em 10 de julho de 2024, o planeta atingiu um novo pico histórico desse indicador, com 44% do globo afetado por estresse térmico forte ou extremo.\n2024 é o ano mais quente já registrado no Brasil, mostram dados do Inmet ic_save\nMais\nic_share\nLeia Mais Ícone fechar Voltar Ver novamente Voltar\nVoltar\nCompartilhe Ícone Facebook Facebook Ícone Whatsapp Whatsapp Ícone X\nX Ícone de messenger Messenger Ícone Linkedin Linkedin Ícone de envelope E-mail Ícone de link Cadeado representando um link Copiar link Ícone fechar Carregando...\nAinda que o fenômeno atmosférico El Niño tenha favorecido as temperaturas particularmente altas no primeiro semestre de 2024, os pesquisadores consideram que a alta concentração de gases-estufa foi a principal responsável para o ano de aquecimento recorde.\nOs primeiros seis meses de 2024 foram de calor intenso, com cada mês registrando temperaturas globais recordes para o respectivo período. Isso acabou contribuindo para uma sequência de 13 meses de recordes mensais de temperaturas, encerrada em junho.\nPlaneta em Transe Uma newsletter com o que você precisa saber sobre mudanças climáticas\nCarregando...\nAinda assim, os termômetros globais permaneceram significativamente acima da média. Em 22 de julho, foi registrado um novo recorde para o dia mais quente da série histórica : 17,16°C.\nNos oceanos, o aquecimento também atingiu valores máximos na série histórica. Em 2024, a temperatura média anual da superfície do mar chegou a 20,87°C: um novo recorde que está 0,51°C acima da média de 1991 a 2020.\nPublicado na madrugada desta sexta-feira, o relatório do Copernicus é o primeiro de uma série de monitoramentos independentes que mostram o estado do clima no planeta. Outros relatórios, incluindo os produzidos pela Nasa (agência espacial americana) e pela OMM (Organização Meteorológica Mundial) serão divulgados ao longo do dia.\nApesar das diferentes metodologias e medições, todos os levantamentos confirmaram que 2024 bateu todos os recordes de aquecimento.\ndê um conteúdo benefício do assinante\nVocê tem 7 acessos por dia para dar de presente.
