    "text": "Métropole de Lyon Cette Ukrainienne a fui la guerre: « Je pensais que cet exil ne durerait pas mais l’amour en a décidé autrement » D’une tragédie est née une belle histoire d’amour digne d’un film. En mars 2022, alors que la guerre fait rage en Ukraine, Hanna Sych et son fils Léonid montent dans le bus affrété par la CCVG, la Communauté de communes de la Vallée du Garon, direction Brignais. Parallèlement, l’agriculteur Jean-Christophe Vialet, est en recherche de travailleurs saisonniers pour son exploitation de la Gerle. Deux ans plus tard, le couple se marie et attend son premier enfant, une petite fille, pour le mois de juillet. Hanna nous raconte son histoire. Quelle était votre vie en Ukraine ? « J’habitais à Kharkiv, à la frontière russe. Je travaillais. Quand les bombardements ont commencé, j’ai eu peur pour mon fils alors âgé de 9 ans. On se réfugiait dans la cave, il faisait froid. Il ne pouvait plus aller à l’école et récupérait ses devoirs en ligne mais 80 % du temps, nous n’avions pas d’électricité. Il pleurait beaucoup. » La décision de partir a-t-elle...",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nBuffalo Bills linebacker Von Miller said allegations of domestic violence leading to his arrest last month are \"100% false\" and \"overblown\" while addressing the situation for the first time publicly on Thursday (December 28).\nMiller, 34, turned himself in to the Glenn Heights, Texas, Police Department on November 30 and was booked into the DeSoto Tri-City Jail after being accused of assaulting his pregnant girlfriend.\n\"Obviously, there are things that I can't talk about but everything that was out is completely wrong and blown out of proportion,\" Miller said via Syracuse.com 's Matt Parrino . \"Me and my girlfriend, we have problems just like any other couple does, but there has never been any of those things that was alleged against me. Hopefully over time, all of this stuff will get cleared up. Sometimes life just ... be life-ing. You've just got to keep pushing and keep moving. The people who know me and the people who have been around me know my character, they know who I am.\"\nMiller was reportedly accused of shoving, pulling the hair and putting his hands around the neck of his girlfriend, according to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by NBC 5 Dallas Fort Worth .\n\"My boyfriend was choking me, hitting me, pulling my hair, I have bruises all over me, my hair- my hair's out,\" the woman told a dispatcher in the 911 call obtained by WFAA .\nThe woman later sent a text message to WFAA downplaying the allegations, claiming she and Miller were \"fine\" and described the incident as \"a verbal disagreement\" and \"a huge misunderstanding.\"\n\"No one assaulted anyone,\" she texted. \"This is insane. And sad.\"\nThe incident reportedly took place at Miller's Dallas home at about 11:00 a.m. on November 29 when \"Miller and the victim got into a verbal argument and the suspect assaulted the victim,\" Dallas Police said.\nMiller reportedly left his home before officers arrived at the scene. The woman told police that the argument started at around 10:50 a.m. when she and Miller, who is currently on a bye week, had a disagreement over travel plans.\nThe woman reportedly went to a home office and slammed the door, at which point she claims Miller got upset and told her to leave. The victim said she tried to gather her belongings before Miller began to \"shove and push her, all while telling her to leave.\"\nThe woman said she pleaded to get her phone and laptop, at which point Miller took out his own phone and recorded the altercation as he continued to push and shove her toward the door. The woman said she pleaded for Miller to stop, acknowledging that she was pregnant, but he reportedly continued to push her, stepped on her feet and caused her to fall back into a chair, at which point he grabbed her by the neck for three to five seconds before letting her go.\nThe woman said she was in pain but didn't experience any difficulties breathing at the time. Miller then reportedly grabbed the victim's phone, threw her laptop on the floor and stomped it before pulling her by her hair, which resulted in a chunk being ripped out and causing her to fall to the ground.\nThe woman said she was then able to start recording the incident on one of her two phones, which she put in her pocket, before Miller continued to push her onto a couch and again placed his hands around her neck. The victim then told Miller she was calling the police, at which point he left their home.\nResponding detectives said they saw minor abrasions on the woman's left hand and bruising on her neck, which were consistent with her assault claims. The victim also reportedly showed investigators a video in which Miller is heard yelling at her to get out during the alleged incident.\nThe woman told police that she was six weeks pregnant and shared a photo of a positive pregnancy test, as well as text conversations with Miller that showed he was aware of the pregnancy. The victim was not transported to a hospital, but received treatment for minor injuries sustained during the attack at the scene.\nMiller, who suffered a torn ACL late in the 2022 season, has appeared in eight games and recorded two tackles in 2023. The former Texas A&M standout signed with Buffalo last offseason after splitting the 2021 season between the Denver Broncos -- with whom he had previously spent his entire career -- and Los Angeles Rams, having won his second Super Bowl in February 2022.\nMiller is a three-time first-team All-Pro, four-time second-team All-Pro, eight-time Pro Bowler and a member of the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.",

    "text": "Pizza Hut to lay off more than 1,000 delivery drivers in California ahead of wage hike LOS ANGELES (KCAL) - They’ve been making it great for 65 years. But some loyal customers say these new cuts are leaving them with a bad taste. “Now, we have to be our own delivery driver,” customer Rogelia Salinas said. She came to pick up pizza for her grandkids at a Pizza Hut in North Hollywood as the delivery wait was too long. But after learning some of the delivery drivers are being canceled altogether, she’s disappointed. “It’s sad. It’s very sad and disappointing that these big companies, you know, that our franchise is laying off the working middle-class people that are trying to survive,” Salinas said. According to documents filed to the state, this Pizza Hut franchise and hundreds of others owned by two of the largest Pizza Hut franchises in California are laying off all their staff drivers. The franchisees say the more than 1,200 layoffs are due to a discontinuation of delivery services, but customers aren’t buying it. “I think when there is a minimum wage increase. They look for a way to mitigate costs and expenses,” said customer Francisco Cardenas. The minimum wage for most fast-food workers in California is increasing to $20 an hour in April. So, the timing of the layoffs isn’t sitting well with many customers. “It’s sad,” Salinas said. Pizza Hut representatives sent a statement saying they are aware of the layoffs taking place at some of its franchise locations in California, but they say all of their franchisees are following state regulations.

    "text": "Kindergarten Jubiläum Kita Ehlespatzen feiert in Biederitz zehnjähriges Bestehen\nMit viel Liebe zum Detail begingen zuletzt Kinder, Eltern und Erzieher das zehnjährige Bestehen der Kita Ehlespatzen in Biederitz.\nBiederitz. Einen Moment lang aus dem Auge gelassen, schon schwuppte aus dem Zauberhut ein bunter Blumenstrauß, der zuvor noch einfarbig daherkam. Mit Verwunderung und gleichzeitiger Begeisterung verfolgten Kinder und Erwachsene die Ausnahmetricks des auftretenden Zauberkünstlers Alfino bei der Jubiläumsfeier gleichermaßen.\nDabei schien die magische Formel „Gulli, Gulli und Hex, Hex“ für sämtliches Verschwinden und wieder Auftauchen von Gegenständen herzuhalten. Darunter Würfel, die „böse“ Coca-Cola, ein ganzer Salzstreuer oder gar der geschickt von Kinderhand eingefädelte Mehrfachknoten. Für den eingeladenen Zauberer schien das bei bestem Wetter nicht der Hauch einer Hürde zu sein.\nMehr zu Kita Ehlespatzen: Tolle Idee: Café-Konzept in Biederitz macht Kinderträume wahr\n„Neben der Show von Zauberer Alfino gibt es Glitzer-Tattoos, einen Stand der Kombüse Gerwisch, selbstgebackenen Kuchen, eine Hüpfeburg sowie Eis vom Förderverein und vieles mehr“, so Betty Dömeland, Leiterin und Mitorganisatorin des mehr als gelungenen Events. Immerhin sollte der zehnte Geburtstag des Ersatzneubaus der Kita Ehlespatzen in der Heyrothsberger Straße ein unvergessliches Ereignis für alle werden.\nLesen Sie auch: Kitas in Biederitz: Warum hier Kinderbetreuung neu gedacht wird\nAuch wenn die Dreiviertelstunde Zaubershow den Kleinsten nachhaltig in Erinnerung bleiben wird, manche wohl über den einen oder anderen Trick noch einige Tage grübeln werden, trumpfte die Einrichtung und ihre engagierten Mitglieder am Ende mit einer großen Überraschung auf.\nSo versammelten sich die etwa 150 Anwesenden, ob groß ob klein, zum großen Finale und krönten den zweistündigen Nachmittag mit einem bunten Ballonmeer. Während aus der Musikbox der Song: Ein Hoch auf uns – von Andreas Bourani schallte, stieg das bunte Spektakel in den Biederitzer Himmel auf.\n„Es ist alles gelaufen wie wir uns es vorgestellt haben, eigentlich war es sogar noch schöner“, so die Leiterin der Kita Ehlespatzen im Anschluss der Veranstaltung. Auch Gemeindebürgermeister Kay Gericke ließ sich nicht nehmen, der gemeindlichen Einrichtung und deren Leiterin Glückwünsche für die ersten zehn Jahre auszurichten.",
