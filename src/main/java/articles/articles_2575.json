    "title": "Six New Windows Vulnerabilities Found, Including First Rust-Based Kernel Flaw",
    "text": "Six new vulnerabilities have been found in Microsoft Windows. One is critical. All are serious.\nCheck Point Research discovered the flaws and disclosed them privately to Microsoft. Patches were released on 12 August as part of Patch Tuesday.\nThe risks are varied: system crashes, arbitrary code execution, and information leaks. For attackers, the attack surface is wide. For defenders, the response must be immediate.\nOne flaw is notable beyond its severity. It may be the first publicly disclosed vulnerability in a Rust-based component of the Windows kernel. Rust was introduced to improve memory safety, a longstanding challenge in operating systems.\nBut here, the flaw was not a traditional memory bug. Rust detected an underlying condition, and instead of handling it quietly, the system responded with a complete crash.\nA kernel-level crash leaves no room for recovery. The machine stops. Unsaved work is lost. For a single device, this is inconvenient. For an enterprise with thousands of endpoints, it can mean hours of interruption, loss of productivity, and a scramble to restore operations. The promise of safer code does not remove the need for relentless testing and rapid remediation.\nTwo other vulnerabilities deserve close attention. Both are memory corruption flaws that allow arbitrary code execution. One carries a critical severity rating. Exploitation is straightforward: an attacker delivers a specially crafted file, the user opens it, and the malicious payload executes. From there, the attacker gains the ability to run any code, deploy remote access tools, exfiltrate data, or install persistence mechanisms that survive reboots.\nThe remaining vulnerabilities focus on information disclosure. While these often require local access, one case is different. CVE-2025-47984 allows a memory leak over the network. Sensitive information could be exposed without an attacker ever touching the physical device. This type of flaw can serve as a stepping stone, revealing tokens, credentials, or other artifacts that enable deeper intrusions.\nThe implications are broader than the six CVEs. Even in mature, widely deployed platforms, weaknesses continue to emerge. New programming languages reduce certain classes of errors but cannot eliminate them entirely. Complexity remains the enemy.\nThe defensive measures are familiar yet vital. Apply the August updates without delay. Monitor networks for suspicious activity. Reduce the window of exposure before these vulnerabilities are weaponized.\nCheck Point customers already have protections in place. Our solutions detect and block attempts to exploit these flaws, maintaining coverage even before official patches are deployed.\nSecurity is not a fixed state. It is a cycle, discover, patch, adapt. Each vulnerability closed today is another challenge deferred to tomorrow. That cycle will not end. But it can be managed. And for defenders, that management is the difference between resilience and compromise.\nInformation Security Buzz News Editor\nKirsten Doyle has been in the technology journalism and editing space for nearly 24 years, during which time she has developed a great love for all aspects of technology, as well as words themselves.

    "text": "“`html\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers union, representing approximately 12,000 Stater Bros. employees throughout Southern california, announced Wednesday a tentative contract agreement with the grocery retailer. This development effectively averts a potential strike that workers had previously authorized.\nnegotiations, spanning four sessions in just nine days, culminated in a proposed agreement that addresses key concerns raised by the union. Details remain confidential for now, pending review by union members.\nUnion officials confirmed the agreement encompasses increased wages, bolstered pension contributions, and enhancements to health, welfare benefits, and staffing levels. A planned boycott of the Stater Bros. location in Huntington Beach, scheduled for Thursday, has been canceled in light of this progress.\n“This victory underscores the power of collective action,” declared the United Food and Commercial Workers Stater Bros. Bargaining Committee in a statement. “Together, we demonstrated our solidarity and secured a contract reflecting our value.”\nThe specifics of the tentative agreement will be presented exclusively to union members during upcoming meetings. Further details will be released to the public following the ratification vote.Stater Bros. Markets also issued a statement acknowledging the agreement.\n“Negotiations were conducted in good faith, with both sides working hard to reach a fair deal that supports our teammates and holds the line on prices for our customers,” Stater Bros. Markets stated. “We appreciate the collaborative effort and are encouraged that the union is recommending the agreement for ratification.”\nGrocery store labor negotiations have been notably active in recent years, reflecting broader economic pressures and the essential role these workers play in the supply chain. Similar negotiations have unfolded at other major grocery chains across the country, often resulting in similar demands for improved wages and benefits.\nThe outcome of this agreement could set a precedent for future negotiations within the industry,possibly influencing standards for grocery workers throughout Southern California and beyond.\nFrequently Asked Questions What is the status of the Stater Bros. contract negotiations? A tentative contract agreement has been reached between Stater Bros. and the United Food and commercial Workers union, averting a potential strike. How many Stater Bros. employees are affected by this agreement? Approximately 12,000 Stater Bros. employees in Southern California are represented by the union and will be impacted by the contract. What are the key provisions of the tentative agreement? The agreement includes higher wages, increased pension contributions, and improvements to health, welfare, and staffing. Specific details are being shared with union members. Was a strike threatened before the agreement? Yes, union workers had previously authorized a strike if a contract agreement could not be reached. What happened to the planned boycott? The boycott of the Stater Bros. Huntington Beach location, scheduled for Thursday, was called off following the tentative agreement. When will the agreement be finalized? The agreement must be ratified by union members through a voting process. Details will be released publicly after the vote. Where can I find more information about the negotiations? Further information will be shared by the United Food and Commercial Workers union and Stater Bros. Markets following the ratification vote.\nWhat are the specific wage increase ranges included in the tentative agreement for Stater Bros. workers?\nStater Bros. Workers Reach Tentative Agreement with Union Key Terms of the Tentative Agreement On August 7, 2025, Stater Bros. Markets and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 135 announced a tentative agreement, averting a potential strike that loomed over Southern California grocery shoppers. This agreement impacts over 17,000 Stater Bros. employees across 170 stores. Here’s a breakdown of the key provisions:\nWage increases: The agreement includes significant wage increases for all Stater Bros. workers. Specific details are still emerging, but reports indicate a tiered system with increases ranging from $0.75 to $1.50 per hour over the contract’s duration. This addresses concerns about the rising cost of living and competitive wages offered by other grocery chains like Ralphs and Vons.\nHealthcare Benefits : Maintaining affordable healthcare was a central issue in negotiations. The tentative agreement preserves existing healthcare benefits with minimal changes to employee contributions. This is a major win for union members, given the increasing cost of healthcare nationwide.\nPension Security: A critical component of the agreement focuses on bolstering the security of Stater Bros. employee pension plans. The UFCW successfully negotiated provisions to protect and strengthen these plans, ensuring a secure retirement for long-term employees.\nPaid Time Off: The agreement includes enhancements to paid time off (PTO) policies, providing workers with more adaptability and time to address personal needs. Details include increased accrual rates and expanded eligibility criteria.\nImpact on Stater Bros. Employees The tentative agreement represents a positive outcome for Stater Bros. employees, who have been working under an expired contract since June 19th. The potential for a strike created significant anxiety among workers and customers alike.\nFinancial Stability: The wage increases will provide a much-needed boost to the financial stability of Stater Bros. employees, notably in light of inflation and rising housing costs in Southern California.\nImproved Work-Life Balance: Enhanced PTO policies will allow employees to better manage their work-life balance, reducing stress and improving overall well-being.\nPeace of Mind: The preservation of healthcare and pension benefits provides employees with peace of mind, knowing that their essential benefits are secure.\nUFCW Local 135 Role: The UFCW Local 135 played a crucial role in advocating for the rights and needs of Stater Bros. workers throughout the negotiation process. Their commitment to securing a fair contract was instrumental in reaching this tentative agreement.\nWhat Happens Next? Ratification Process The tentative agreement is not yet finalized. It must be ratified by a vote of the UFCW Local 135 membership.\nFacts Meetings: The UFCW will hold informational meetings in the coming days to present the details of the agreement to its members. Membership vote: A ratification vote will be scheduled, allowing union members to cast their ballots on whether to accept or reject the agreement. Official Announcement: Once the vote is tallied, the UFCW will announce the results. If ratified, the agreement will go into affect immediately. If rejected, negotiations could resume, potentially leading to a strike. Stater Bros. and the Competitive Grocery Landscape This agreement comes at a time of intense competition within the Southern California grocery market. Ralphs and Vons, both owned by Kroger , recently reached agreements with their unionized workforce after a period of tense negotiations and threatened strikes.\nIndustry Trends: The grocery industry is facing challenges related to labor costs, supply chain disruptions, and changing consumer preferences.\nLabor Negotiations: Recent labor negotiations across the industry highlight the growing power of unions and the increasing demands for fair wages and benefits.\nStater Bros.’ Position: Stater Bros., as a privately held company, operates differently than its publicly traded competitors. This often influences its approach to labor negotiations. Maintaining a positive relationship with its workforce is seen as crucial to its success.\nHistorical Context: Previous stater Bros. Union Agreements Past negotiations between Stater Bros. and the UFCW have often been contentious, but ultimately resulted in agreements that addressed the needs of both parties.\n2019 Agreement: The 2019 agreement focused on wage increases and healthcare benefits, mirroring many of the concerns addressed in the current negotiations.\nLong-Term Relationship: Stater Bros. and the UFCW have a long-standing relationship,built on a history of collective bargaining and compromise.This history likely contributed to the successful negotiation of the tentative agreement.\nResources for More Information UFCW Local 135: [https://www.ufcw135.org/](https://www.ufcw1",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Sen. Susan Collins [said Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF5ICmhqOgM) she will not endorse former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, even if he wins the Republican nomination. Collins, a Republican, made the comments while speaking in front of a group of reporters in Washington. She said she didn't choose an alternative candidate to endorse earlier because she's friends with multiple people who were running against Trump. The senator has not formally endorsed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, the only other GOP candidate left in the race, but she did say she's glad Haley is still in it. Collins has been representing Maine in the U.S. Senate since 1997. In February 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
