    "text": "Advisory warns of activity by BianLian ransomware group A joint advisory released Nov. 20 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and international partners warns of cybercriminal activity by the BianLian ransomware group. The agencies said actions by BianLian actors have impacted multiple sectors across the U.S. since 2022. They operate by gaining access to victims' systems through valid remote desktop protocol credentials and use open-source tools and command-line scripting for finding and stealing credentials. The actors then extort money from victims by threatening to release the stolen data. \"The BianLian group has been listed as one of the most active groups over the last several years, and they have been known to attack the health care sector,\" said Scott Gee, AHA deputy national advisor for cybersecurity and risk. \"The group often uses RDP for access, which serves as a reminder to ensure that hospitals strictly limit the use of RDP and similar services to help mitigate this threat and the many others which use RDP as part of their initial access to penetrate networks. They do not appear to be encrypting networks and disrupting hospital operations. In the event that anyone’s personally identifiable information is stolen and think they may be a victim of identity theft, an excellent resource to help assist them is identitytheft.gov .\" For more information on this or other cyber and risk issues contact Gee at sgee@aha.org.

    "text": "A Metropolitan Police officer who ran operations at the Queen’s funeral and the King’s coronation has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. Commander Karen Findlay has been named a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, as well as receiving the King’s Police Medal. She called the awards a “lovely, unexpected surprise”. She said: “Having transferred south of the border from Grampian Police in 1993 to the Met, I have over the last 30 years had the privilege of working with many amazing people who have given me support, advice, encouragement and friendship. “None more so than within public order policing. To lead the Met through the policing operations for the state funeral and Coronation will always remain the privileges of my life.” As well as her work as gold commander at major events, she was recognised for her efforts in championing diversity and building relationships with young people, as well as her sporting career as a captain and coach of the Scotland women’s rugby team. She is one of 10 members of the Metropolitan Police recognised in the New Year Honours list. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: “These awards are hugely deserved and very special. I hope that the recipients and their families and loved ones take great pride in them. “The awards reflect a variety of contributions across different aspects of policing in London and beyond. “From preventing and investigating terrorism and knife crime to leading large-scale ceremonial and sporting events and promoting inclusion and equality across our organisation, this is a snapshot of our exceptional people.” Explosives Officer Mick Kettle was made an MBE while Detective Inspector Rasheed Alawiye receives the British Empire Medal for developing and championing diversity and inclusion initiatives across the force. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward receives a King’s Police Medal (KPM) for his work in counter terrorism and delivering the policing plan for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham with West Midlands Police. There are also KPMs for Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Gosling for counter terrorism, Detective Chief Superintendent Hayley Sewart for transforming the national knife crime portfolio and Detective Inspector Amanda Stephenson for her work in family liaison. Sergeant Nicholas Birch, Detective Constable Kevin Malkin and Sergeant Elizabeth St Clair are made members of the Royal Victorian Order for their royalty and specialist protection service.

    "text": "(RNS) — For most of his life, Rishik Dhar was areligious. An engineering supervisor at Amazon and self-described “man of science,” he had a hard time finding meaning or identity in the ritualistic Hinduism he had grown up with.\nThat is, until, a midlife crisis brought Dhar, 44, back to his family’s roots in Kashmir Shaivism, a philosophy that emphasizes God as a pure consciousness rather than an almighty being. Shaivism, according to Dhar, can be a philosophical way of life just as much as a devotional worship practice to Lord Shiva — the blue, all-powerful god of destruction.\nBest of all for Dhar, Shaivism overlaps with science — particularly, he said, with quantum physics. “Understanding the universality of the philosophy makes me feel a little more comfortable with what I used to consider was my own natural inclination not to be deeply religious,” he said.\n“What science does is it gives a very articulate language to the idea of spirituality,” said Dhar. “And in that sense, it brings about a balance. If faith works for you, you can still pursue your faith. But now you have an expression that you can also rely on to communicate why you have that faith.”\nOn Maha Shivaratri, the holiday observed March 8, in which Lord Shiva’s cosmic energies are believed to be at their peak, Dhar launched Shaivite.org: a website to serve an “unpretentious and accessible” community for skeptics, atheists and holy men alike.\nRELATED: Revitalization of India’s ancient sacred city of Varanasi leaves some longtime visitors cold With some 250 million followers worldwide, Shaivism is thought to be second only to Vaishnavism in its number of followers. For Westerners, worshipping “the totality that envelops all our presentations, our being and our existence,” Shaivism’s concept of the divine, can be difficult, s aid Sthaneshwar Timalsina, a professor of classical Indic humanities at Stony Brook University and a Shaivite . “Hinduism offers you infinity choice as to how to relate to the Absolute, and you do not always have to believe in God or some kind of almighty entity.”\nFor “nonreligious” Hindus like Dhar, Shaivism’s openness to questioning leaves room for a “scientific method” of finding the relative truth.\nShaivism is often referred to as a monotheistic worship, though according to followers, this characterization is incomplete. Lord Shiva is one of a holy trinity of supreme gods, along with the Creator, Brahma, and the Preserver, Vishnu.\nBut to Shaivites, the primordial energy of Shiva is not only a god but a representation of all metaphysical existence beyond the comprehensible reach of dogma, and manifests in various forms through nature, even in one’s own atman, or soul.\n“There’s just not enough in the human brain to conceive of the inconceivable,” said Paramacharya Sadasivanathaswami, a Shaivite monk at the Himalayan Academy, a monastery on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. “Shiva in his manifested state is the creator, preserver, destroyer and the lord and master of the universe, both immanent and transcendent. He is the vastness and the void, and both are here to be worshipped.”\nUniquely in the Hindu faith, Shiva is worshipped not through a traditional embodied idol, like the elephant-headed Ganesh, but rather a “formless, timeless and causeless” phallic object called a lingam, meant to represent Shiva in his transcendent state.\nThe performance of rituals to a phallus is sometimes difficult even for other Hindus to grasp, Timalsina said. Thousands of years ago, he pointed out, nature-worshipping animists deified one or the other of the sources of all humankind, either a womb or a phallus.\n“The linga, which means symbol, becomes a site for me to visualize an embodied being: to see, to carve, to chisel with my own mind a complete persona,” said Timalsina, who said sometimes his Shiva has a shape or a form, but most often is abstract.\nThe connection between science and religion is another feature of Shaivism that befuddles Westerners. Sadasivanathaswami talks about Lord Shiva’s perfection in terms of “every atom of the known and unknown cosmos” and called the recitation of Shiva’s special mantra — “Om Namah Shivaya” — “scientific,” its vibrations creating a focused state of mind that brings a worshipper closer to God.\nAmong tech-minded Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Shaivism has become increasingly visible. For the Maha Shivaratri celebration in March, thousands of devotees flocked to the Maha Kaleshwar Mandir, a Shiva temple in Milpitas, California, with some 500 staying to chant overnight.\nPushkar Nandkar, a tech worker who said he has been “pretty atheist,” said the temple has become his sanctuary for grounding against his hectic daily schedule. “Slowly, as you read more, you land upon what feels connected to you and what feels right to you,” he said.\n“Shiva is all about stability,” he added. “As humans, we move so much. Our thoughts move so much. Here we have the privilege to connect at the deity’s vibrational frequency. As you come nearer, the energies will come to you.”\nOriginally a successful serial tech entrepreneur, Sreeram Pydah never quite saw himself as religious or spiritual until much later in his life, after a divorce pushed him to search deeper into “the whole creation.” Rather than looking at this temple as another one of his businesses, however, the now-spiritual Pydah said the temple is his “life’s purpose.”\n“People are actually looking for Shiva to give them guidance,” he said. “They’re looking to sit down and meditate, even learn the art of meditation. And that kind of force is what we want to embellish. We want to make sure that we actually raise that level of energy.”\nPydah noted that many of his temple goers come from the science or tech world, some not certain about defining themselves as religious, just as he was. But as the world continues to move, he says, it is ever-important to remain grounded in some kind of belief.\n“Economic affluence is great. I think it’s good to have that. But if the soul truly doesn’t get the experience, the spirit, the energy, that it deserves or it needs, you’re really not successful at the end of the day.”\nRELATED: From India’s Bihar to California’s Bay Area, Hindus celebrate ancient sun festival",

He was described as being \"purple\" in colour with blood coming from his nose. A search of his cell failed to find any sign of controlled drugs, illicit substances or drug paraphernalia. However, following his death, prison staff were told that he had shown another prisoner a \"quantity\" of etizolam also known as street Valium. The inquiry heard that he had been told that it was \"far too much to be taking at one time\" by fellow prisoners. It was further reported that over the weekend he had consumed a new drug, which was being called Amo. The drug was being smuggled into prisons across Scotland by being soaked into paper and then sent as letters to prisoners. The paper was boiled in a kettle and the water was drunk or used to make tea. Welch's cause of death was concluded to be caused by the \"ingestion of a combination of drugs, combined with pre-existing coronary artery atherosclerosis\". The report added: \"These likely acted in combination leading to progressive respiratory depression, coma and ultimately death.\" Sheriff Kelly KC concluded: \"It is tragically regrettable that this combination of drugs did find its way into the prison estate and contributed to the untimely death of Mr Welch. This Inquiry strengthened the need to take due care in these routines (of checking patients) to be sure that officers see the face of and obtain a response from all prisoners. \"With numerous cells to check and with checks being required three or four times per day, the risk of becoming slapdash in receiving a verbal response is evident.\" A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We fully recognise the impact on loved ones when someone dies in custody and our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Welch. Our staff work hard to tackle the introduction of illicit substances and prevent the harm they cause. \"We have seen the success of some measures, such as the photocopying of mail, in stopping that supply into our establishments. However, we are not complacent and will continue to do all we can to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people in our care.\" Sign up for Edinburgh Live's newsletter Get all the latest news and headlines from Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians sent straight to your inbox twice a day by signing up to our free newsletter.
