    "text": "Yellow haze: The impact of wildfire smoke in CT and NY Smoke from the massive wildfires in Canada was a serious climate and health concern for our region this year. The sky was filled with a noxious yellow haze that traveled across the northeast, to the Midwest, and even to Europe. The gritty air drove many people to wear masks once again to protect their health. Right now the air has cleared, but concerns over the impact on public health and the environment remain. Morning Edition Host Tom Kuser speaks with the American Lung Association and an environmental scientist about the effects of the smoke and if this may be the beginning of a climate shift we’ll have to manage in the future.

    "title": "Opinion: Liberal MPs lack the means - but mostly the courage - to take down their Leader - The Globe and Mail",
    "text": "Listen to this article\nIt was, by all accounts, a “robust” discussion at Wednesday’s Liberal caucus meeting. And not only robust, but “frank” and “difficult.”\nAnd why not? Ostensibly Liberal MPs were there to debate whether Justin Trudeau should stay on as Leader. But there were also important principles at stake, as I need hardly tell you. Principles like: will I lose my seat? Or: will I get into cabinet?\nIn the end those more worried about the former appear to have been outnumbered by those more hopeful of the latter (a cabinet of 39 out of a caucus of 153 offers pretty good odds) and the Leader at the start of the meeting was still the Leader at the end. For all of the hyperbolic advance billing, however, not much else seems to have been resolved.\nThe rebels, whoever they were – in the dramatic high point of the meeting, a letter calling on Mr. Trudeau to resign was read out, supposedly with the support of 24 MPs, none of whose signatures were attached – issued a vague ultimatum demanding that the Prime Minister “make a decision” on his future by Oct. 28. Or else … what?\nThe loyalists, if that’s what they are, came out of the meeting insisting caucus was united because, well, they all want to defeat the Conservatives. That’s good news, if you’re a Liberal. Certainly it would be worse news if Liberal MPs could not agree that it would be better, on balance, if the Liberals were to win the next election rather than the Conservatives. But it skips over the little question of who should lead the party in that fight.\nMostly what the whole affair reveals, as if there were any doubt, is how utterly supine Liberal MPs have become – how fearful, how craven – before the power of the Party Leader. The days before the meeting had been filled with accounts of small groups of MPs meeting in secret; of a letter being circulated, on paper, with no copies permitted; of MPs making each other swear not to wilt in the face of the inevitable counterattack from the Leader’s office, all relayed in whispered off-the-record briefings to reporters, no doubt with the aid of false wigs and burner phones.\nIs this any way for the elected representatives of a G7 democracy to carry on? These are not below-stairs servants in the mansion of some Transylvanian count. These are members of the Parliament of Canada, once considered a position of some repute. Each one of these frightened shadows was elected by the votes of tens of thousands of their fellow citizens to represent them in the House of Commons, to shape the laws that govern us, to stand up, to speak out.\nYet here they are, too terrified, even in their desperation to rid themselves of a Leader who has taken the party to the brink of annihilation, to so much as say their own names, lest the wrath of His Awful Majesty or His More Awful Chief of Staff come down upon them.\nBut of course they are. It isn’t just that every moment of an MP’s political life, from the day they seek the nomination to the day they leave, is controlled by the Leader’s office – their fates determined, their votes decided, their every utterance dictated – in a way that would crush the most independent spirit. It’s that these are the people who volunteered for this, who willingly signed up for this humiliation. That a small minority have belatedly summoned the nerve to challenge the Leader – only, leave my name out of it, won’t you – is not out of any newfound desire for liberty or self-respect, but only in search of a more electable slavelord.\nThings are a little different in the Conservative camp, since the caucus, alone among the parties, voted to adopt each of the powers available to it under the 2015 Reform Act: not only the power to elect their own caucus chair, or to expel or readmit a member, but also, crucially, the power to fire the leader, with rules for how it could be done.\nStill, the leader retains enormous power over individual members, not least since, like every party leader, their signature is required on their nomination papers. A majority of the Conservative caucus now has the means to toss its leader, but woe betide the Conservative MP who steps out of line.\nBut even by the standards of the other parties, the Liberal caucus has proved notably servile. They are desperate to rid themselves of Mr. Trudeau now, but they were no less desperate to surrender themselves to him a decade ago. And now they are stuck with him. They can make his life miserable if he stays, but they cannot make him go.\nSign up for the Opinion Newsletter.\nKeep your opinions sharp and informed with a helpful summary of The Globe’s most provocative columns, covering politics, world affairs, business, arts, health and the way we live",

    "title": "2024 Trends: Brands Embrace User-Generated Content in Influencer Marketing",
    "text": "Inc describes how brands will usher in a new era in influencer marketing in 2024 with user-generated content and engaging real customers. The article highlights how brands in 2024 are increasingly leveraging everyday people instead of professional content creators. This tactic, which includes giving away products and affiliate revenue, aims to strengthen relationships with customers and involve brand superfans more closely in product development.\nExperts in the influencer marketing industry were the first to notice this trend. Chris Jacks from the agency HireInfluence emphasizes that user generated content (UGC) is particularly suitable for companies with limited marketing budgets. Changing algorithms and social platforms, as well as consumers’ preference for less polished and produced content, have contributed to this change.\nBrands like Perelel and Beauty Stat work with existing customers to generate UGC by offering free products. This strategy not only leads to conversion but also long-term visibility. Additionally, brands emphasize the importance of building lasting relationships through rewards such as invitations to brand events or being featured on the website or social media.\nGifting strategies are also an important part of this approach, with brands able to offer incentives such as affiliate commissions on TikTok or advertising discounts for creating UGC. It’s also important to strategically decide who to send products to, with a focus on micro-influencers in relevant niches.\nWhile traditional influencer marketing still has its place, the article emphasizes that diversity in marketing strategy, including incorporating UGC, is beneficial for brands. Especially for brands with limited budgets or those looking to diversify their influencer marketing campaigns, this approach offers a solid option.\n2023-12-28 20:06:37\n#Revolution #Influencer #Marketing #Power #Superfans",

They may contain errors.\n-\nGeoff Bennett:\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency yesterday in response to bird flu that's spreading among that state's dairy cows. The virus has already caused the deaths of more than 120 million birds across the country since 2022.\nStephanie Sy reports now on the news from Colorado on efforts to keep the dairy work force safe, given concerns that, the more the virus spreads, the greater the possibility that it mutates to allow spread among humans.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nIn this stretch of rural Colorado, Soraya Leon is a lifeline for many agricultural workers.\n-\nSoraya Leon, Community Health Worker, Project Protect:\nThe farmworkers and dairy workers, it's very hard. It's very hard to survive.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nShe's a community health worker with Project Protect, part of a statewide nonprofit. Her regular visits and food deliveries to farmworkers in need now includes a bag full of face shields and masks, the equipment that protects them from bird flu.\nSince the spring, avian influenza has been spreading in dairy cattle and has infected about 60 farmworkers nationwide. Despite the risks, this worker said he's gotten little information from his employer.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nThe owner, we never see him. They're not interested in us.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nSpeaking to us anonymously because he is undocumented, he told us earlier this year he was ill and had conjunctivitis. Commonly known as pink eye, the symptom is a sign of possible infection from this strain of bird flu.\n-\nSoraya Leon:\nOn a statistic, we don't have too much people sick from this fever. But on the reality, many people got sick, but they never know, because they never had information about what the symptoms are or how they feel.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nLeon is part of a network of so-called promotoras established during COVID to help spread critical information to Colorado's many Hispanic farmworkers.\nLately, the promotora network has shifted to addressing the threat from bird flu.\nDid workers get enough information when bird flu started circulating in this area over the summer?\n-\nSoraya Leon:\nNot really. The government response was too late. They know they have the sickness because the symptoms, the eyes, and the cows. So now they know they got this sickness, but only because we provide information later, not before.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nIn addition to groups like Project Protect, a federally funded agricultural health and safety center at Colorado State University has been using social media to provide information to workers.\nWhile the virus, known as H5N1, has killed more than 100 million poultry birds and tens of thousands of Marine mammals, in cows, it has been less deadly, with most recovering after experiencing a drop in milk production.\nWhile at least one person has been hospitalized with bird flu, this recent strain of the virus circulating in cows has been relatively mild in humans, and the risk to the public remains low.\nBut Colorado state veterinarian Maggie Baldwin and state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy are watching the changes in the pathogen closely.\n-\nDr. Maggie Baldwin, Colorado State Veterinarian:\nWe have seen this virus move from species to species before. We have seen spillover of this virus from wild birds and from poultry to mammals, and particularly that's been wild mammals in the past. What's concerning is the mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus right now.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nWhile pasteurization has been shown to kill the virus in milk and dairy products, workers coming into contact with raw milk are at risk.\n-\nDr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado State Epidemiologist:\nWe know that the more opportunities that we give this virus to be exposed to people, the more opportunities it has to adapt potentially and then gain that ability to potentially spread from person to person. And that's, of course, what we want to prevent.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nSince July, Colorado has mandated weekly bird flu testing of bulk milk samples from its licensed dairies.\n-\nDr. Maggie Baldwin:\nEvery week, we have seen fewer and fewer positives, which is fantastic news. But we really don't know what the long-term impact of this virus looks like. We know that, yes, the dairy cows do seem to build some level of an immune response, but we don't know if an infected herd could become reinfected.\nAnd dairy herds are constantly bringing in new replacement animals all the time.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nOver the summer, more than half of the dairy herds in Colorado tested positive for avian influenza. While there hasn't been a positive case since August, there's still concern about dairy farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nThere really is very little support.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nAt a Mexican restaurant, we met one longtime dairy worker who also wanted to remain anonymous because of his immigration status.\nHave companies given the right protections to farmworkers to keep them safe?\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nThere really weren't any measures taken. The only measure to avoid infection was when they washed the tires of the trailer trucks that arrived to drop off the feed. But as far as the personnel, I never saw them wearing any protective gear to avoid infection.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nHe described a friend who got sick and said the lack of paid sick leave makes workers hesitant to report their illnesses.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nFrom the moment a worker gets sick and stops working, he doesn't get anything.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nCommunity health worker Soraya Leon says there are also issues with access to clinics and the cost of care. Immigration status also plays a role in workers not getting tested.\n-\nSoraya Leon:\nUndocumented people, they don't say anything because they are afraid all the time.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nZach Riley with the Colorado Livestock Association says the industry has been a crucial partner with state officials in protecting animal and worker health.\n-\nZach Riley, Colorado Livestock Association:\nThere's been multiple free resources provided by the state and by employers to try to make sure that you are protected. I would say you would be hard-pressed to find somebody not doing it.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nI mean, we did speak to some farmworkers who said, without the help of these nonprofit organizations, might not have had the information or the PPE at their disposal.\n-\nZach Riley:\nI would venture to guess that's a very limited case and very limited number of those. Any one of our producers would gladly tell you they're offering a whole treasure trove of things to their employees.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nBut despite efforts to reach out to several different cattle organizations, including Riley's, we couldn't find a Colorado dairy farmer to speak with us, some citing concerns around the potential spread of bird flu.\nIn November, research from Colorado and Michigan confirmed what many people suspected. Antibody tests showed more farmworkers had signs of previous bird flu infections.\n-\nDr. Rachel Herlihy:\nThat is not uncommon when it comes to infectious diseases, because not everyone gets tested. But it does tell us that we still have work to do to protect humans from exposure.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nBack at El Centenario Mexican restaurant, this dairy worker agreed that more support is needed.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nMost people who work on dairy farms. Most of us lack someone to tell us what guarantees we have. We are really lacking information.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nWhile there haven't been recent cases of bird flu in Colorado, dairy herds, the virus is continuing to spread widely in California cows. Earlier this month, federal ag regulators took Colorado's lead and announced mandatory milk testing for the first time, an acknowledgement that we are still a long ways from getting a handle on the spread of this disease.\nFor the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Stephanie Sy in Weld County, Colorado.",

    "text": "Further signs of Macy’s decline could make going private increasingly inevitable Macy’s may need to reconsider its buyout options, as its stores continue to fall out of favor with shoppers. Data from retail insights firm [Pass_by](https://passby.com/) showed that foot traffic to Macy’s stores fell 2.49% in 2023 compared to the year before. More worryingly, during the biggest shopping season – Black Friday week and December — the drop was even sharper. During Black Friday week, Macy’s foot traffic decreased 5.24% year over year; in December, the traffic was down 6.82%. Last week, the company laid off over 2,300 workers, or 3.5% of its workforce, likely reflecting that the holiday season and 2024 outlook aren’t very strong, Morningstar analyst David Swartz told Yahoo Finance over the phone. This comes just days after Macy’s [ rejected](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-macys-rejected-its-58-billion-buyout-bid--and-whats-next-231609886.html) a $5.8 billion buyout offer from one of its shareholders, Arkhouse, and its partner Brigade Capital Management. The original proposal, made on Dec.1, would see the company go private for $21.00 per share, a 32% premium to Macy’s share price then. Now, another bidder may have entered the conversation. Shares of Macy's ended Thursday's trading session up nearly 4%, after the New York Post reported that private equity firm Sycamore Partners, which largely specializes in retail and consumer investments, has been in talks to take the 165-year-old department store private. Macy's declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on the latest offer, while Sycamore Partners did not respond to a request for comment. Arkhouse isn't giving up though. The investment firm has said it would be willing to share more about its financing or up its offer if Macy’s would sign a non-disclosure agreement and give the firm access to due diligence information. Despite its flagging business, Macy’s valuable portfolio of stores has made it a target for buyouts. Its real estate alone could be worth $8.5 billion, according to veteran executive and retail expert Jan Kniffen. [ Others told Yahoo Finance in December](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-shares-surge-after-buyout-bid-but-unlocking-its-real-estate-value-will-take-work-232625062.html) it could be worth even more. \"What [Arkhouse has] done no matter what [is] drawn a lot of attention to Macy's, and kind of forced everyone to analyze ... how the real estate's quite valuable,\" TD Cowen managing director Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance, adding even more suitors could come knocking given the newfound realization. So, will Macy's be the next Sears, or is there potential for a comeback story? Aron Bohlig, ComCap Managing Partner, told Yahoo Finance that going private could help Macy’s accelerate its turnaround, as it allows them to reset outside of the microscope of the public markets. In the online shopping age, “there's really no room for people in the middle, you've either got to be one of the top kind of two or three players,\" said Bohlig. \"If you imagine a landscape with a Walmart, a Target and a Nordstrom, each of them have a very clear demographic they serve. Macy's is a little bit stuck in the middle. They need to be going more Nordstrom, less Target,\" he added. While Macy's rejected the first bid, Bohlig said the team may want to think twice now. \"The board really should be looking at this very seriously and considering this as a great opportunity to leverage their existing strengths, but build in some great new DNA with one of these outside partners,\" he said. \"There's a very good chance this will go private.\" There’s also the risk of a missed opportunity. In 2018, Nordstrom rejected a buyout offer from the Nordstrom family that valued the company at $50 per share, which was below its trading price at the time. Its stock is now trading at less than $20. As of Thursday, Macy’s shares are still down over 25% compared to five years ago, while rival Kohl's is down more than 50%. \"They don't want to be in a situation where two years from now people are regretting that they didn't take an offer, or not necessarily take it, at least consider it,\" said Swartz of Arkhouse’s bid. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.
