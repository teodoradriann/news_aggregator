    "text": "Mirwaiz barred from Friday prayers at Jamia Mosque In a statement, Mirwaiz said that after his release on September 22 following four years of house detention since August 2019, he was only permitted to go to the Jamia Masjid for three Fridays The chief priest of Jamia Masjid and Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was on Friday not allowed to offer congregational prayers at the grand mosque in the old city. The prayers were held at the grand mosque but the chief priest was not allowed to move out of his house in Nigeen in the outskirts of Srinagar. He denounced his “house detention” by authorities. In a statement, Mirwaiz said that after his release on September 22 following four years of house detention since August 2019, he was only permitted to go to the Jamia Masjid for three Fridays. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) “Since then, every Friday, he has been put under house arrest without any reason provided by the authorities,” the statement added. Since October 13, Friday prayers were not allowed at the grand mosque for 10 weeks as security forces had apprehensions that there could be protests in support of Palestine. “It was only last week that people were allowed to offer Friday prayers there. The duration of this permission remains uncertain while the ban on me continues,” Mirwaiz said. “The authorities whimsically open or close the central Jamia Masjid to Muslims for prayers without accountability, and no one can enquire about the reasons,” he alleged. On December 22, Anjuman Auqaf of Jama Masjid had said that authorities allowed Friday prayers at the historic mosque after a gap of ten weeks. However, Mirwaiz alleged that he was being confined to his home on Fridays. “It mocks the authorities’ own statements claiming things are great in Jammu & Kashmir, and I am a free man who can go anywhere,” he added. Mirwaiz claimed that control of any kind, including on religious rights, cannot bring or maintain peace. “Those in-charge of decision-making should revisit this policy, considering historical precedents and adopting a long-term perspective,” he said. Mirwaiz has been leading the prayers and delivering Friday sermons at Jamia Masjid as part of the Mirwaiz’s family tradition.",

    "title": "Dreaming of a White Christmas? The chances are declining for the Twin Cities",
    "text": "By Meteorologist Sven Sundgaard ,\n2 hours ago If you’re dreaming of a White Christmas in the Twin Cities/ southern Minnesota, keep dreaming and cross your fingers and toes. If we pull it off this year, it’s going to be close.\nClimatologically speaking, we have a White Christmas three out of every four years on average. Of course last year we had quite the opposite of a White Christmas, with over an inch of rain and record high temperatures in the 50s.\nIn 2022 we had 10 inches of snow pack, while 2021 was another Brown Christmas. If we look at the past four years, only two were white and the other two brown.\nSign up for our BREAKING WEATHER newsletters\nThe average snow depth, since the year 2000 is four inches on Dec. 25. While the official climatology is a 75% chance of a White Christmas in the Twin Cities using the 1991-2020 average, since 2000 that has dropped to just 67%.\nNWS\nYou guessed it: climate change is a likely culprit as December is one of our fastest warming months in the state.\nThe big climate trend in recent years is that winter still happens, of course, but gets a later start, which impacts your White Christmas.\nThe Christmas forecast Unsplash&plus\nEnough with averages. How about the forecast for the next 12 days?\nIf we look at the National Blend of Models, essentially a weighted average of the models, it gives us a pathetic 0.8 inches of TOTAL snowfall between now and Christmas.\nThat in itself would be enough as \"white\" is defined by an inch of snow cover and we round up with snow measurements to the nearest whole inch, so technically we’d only need half-an-inch to qualify. I know it’s not quite what people would like to play in, but that’s the technical definition.\nWeatherbell\nIf we zoom out to all the models, they range at giving us anywhere from 1 to 2 total inches in a more optimistic scenario.\nThe other forecast challenge though isn’t just snowfall but temperatures. We’ve had some actual cold weather this winter unlike some recent ones, BUT it’s been a roller coaster. Last weekend was 52 degrees and this weekend we could be near 40 on Sunday again, with a -7 degree reading in between!\nIf the European model verifies, we’re in trouble. There are several above freezing days that would easily melt 0.8 inches of snow.\nWeatherbell\nIf the Canadian model is right, keeping things colder, we may just hang on to a half inch of snow to be defined as \"white.\"\nWeatherbell\nWithout going too in depth, my \"back of a napkin\" calculations based on all the models snowfall and all the models temperatures, I put the probability of that 1/2” of snow depth at about 42%.\nBUT, yesterday, that same calculation with different model outputs was between 50% and 68%. Each model run is going to be slightly different.\nIf we REALLY want a White Christmas and ample snow to play in, we need to depend on a surprise storm or rather a surprise shift in a storm track. Even in almost 2025, this still happens which makes forecasting fun and challenging!\nBMTN Note: Weather events in isolation can't always be pinned on climate change, but the broader trend of increasingly severe weather and record-breaking extremes seen in Minnesota and across the globe can be attributed directly to the rapidly warming climate caused by human activity. The IPCC has warned that Earth is \"firmly on track toward an unlivable world,\" and says greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 in order to limit warming to 1.5C, which would prevent the most catastrophic effects on humankind.

    "text": "City Council OKs $50 million settlement with 4 men wrongfully convicted of 1995 murders\nBy Todd Feurer, Darius Johnson\nClick here for updates on this story\nCHICAGO, Illinois (\nWBBM) — The Chicago City Council unanimously approved a $50 million settlement with four men who were wrongfully convicted of a 1995 double murder and spent 20 years in prison before they were cleared.\nCharles Johnson, Larod Styles, Troshawn McCoy, and Lashawn Ezell, the so-called “Marquette Park Four,” were between 15 and 19 at the time when they confessed to taking part in the robbery and murders. But they said their confessions were coerced. Their attorneys said no physical or forensic evidence linked them to the crime.\nThey were all given sentences ranging from 20 years to life in prison.\nAs a part of the settlement, the city would pay $21 million of the settlement and the city’s insurance company would pay the remaining $29 million. The approval of the settlement resolved four separate federal civil lawsuits brought by the men against the city.\nIn a joint statement, the four men said: “We are grateful that the City of Chicago has chosen to resolve our case and allow us to move on with our lives. No amount of money can ever return the years we lost due to Chicago Police misconduct that caused our collective 73 years of wrongful imprisonment. The City of Chicago must take steps to protect our teenagers from police abuses like those we endured.”\nIn 2017, Cook County prosecutors recommended vacating their convictions after determining they could not meet their burden of proof if their cases were retried.\n“Charles, Larod, Lashawn, and Troshawn are among the scores of kids who the Chicago Police Department has targeted for false arrest and coercive interrogations over the years, leading to Chicago’s reputation as the False Confession Capital of the country,” said Alex Van Brunt, Johnson’s attorney and the director of the Illinois office of the MacArthur Justice Center, in a statement after the approval of the settlement.\nAld. Bill Conway (34th), a Finance Committee member, said while it’s difficult to put a dollar amount on their innocence, he’s worried about the many other similar cases in Chicago.\n“So I have significant concern on the amount here,” Conway said. “I have no doubt as to the liability of the city, but I have significant concern at the standard we’re setting at this level, at this amount.”\nJohnson and Styles were sentenced to life in prison for killing Ali and Ibrahim in a robbery at their car dealership at 75th and Western. They were accused of stealing two cars. Johnson, a Cola-Cola deliveryman, was arrested after he returned home from work and signed a confession saying he planned to steal cars for parts to sell on the black market. He claims Chicago Police detectives pressured him into confessing.\nTests showed a match between fingerprints found on a car at the used-car lot and fingerprints on the adhesive side of a price sticker torn off one of the two cars stolen from the lot. Those same fingerprints were also found on the stolen cars. The prints belonged not to any of the “Marquette Park Four” but to a felon who lived a block from where the stolen cars were recovered.\nEzell, Styles, Johnson, and McCoy sued the city a year after they were exonerated. All four have since received certificates of innocence.\nNo one else has been convicted of the murders.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "A chuva que atinge a capital paulista na noite desta quinta-feira, 2, colocou toda a cidade em estado de atenção para alagamentos por quase duas horas, de acordo com o Centro de Gerenciamento de Emergências Climáticas (CGE) da Prefeitura de São Paulo. As precipitações formadas pelo ar quente e úmido geraram uma linha de instabilidade englobando a zona sul, o centro e a zona leste da cidade, principalmente nas regiões do Itaim Paulista, Ipiranga, Vila Mariana, Sapopemba e Aricanduva. Às 19h30, o CGE informou que todas as regiões estavam em estado de atenção para alagamentos. O quadro ficou vigente até as 21h18. Nesse intervalo, houve o transbordamento do Córrego Três Pontes, na Avenida Marechal Tito, na altura da Rua José Gines, e a subprefeitura do Itaim Paulista entrou em estado de alerta - também já revisto. Conforme os dados do radar meteorológico da administração municipal, as precipitações ocorrem na forma de pancadas, que se deslocam de oeste para leste, com pontos de forte intensidade, raios e rajadas de vento, indo em direção aos municípios à leste da Região Metropolitana e para o litoral. Os próximos dias também devem ser de sol, calor e pancadas de chuva no fim da tarde. Na sexta-feira, 3, os termômetros marcam cerca de 20°C na madrugada e chegam a 30°C no período da tarde, com umidade mínima do ar em torno dos 50%. Pancadas de chuva são esperadas à tarde, com intensidade moderada a forte. Já o sábado, 4, amanhece com maior quantidade de nuvens, apesar do sol. Os termômetros deverão registrar 20°C em média, com índices de umidade elevados, acima dos 60%. A aproximação de uma frente fria deve estimular a formação de nuvens carregadas à tarde e à noite, elevando o potencial para a elevação dos níveis de rios e córregos, alagamentos e quedas de árvores. Transtornos em Campinas e no Paraná Em Campinas, no interior paulista, a Defesa Civil registrou 16 ocorrências relacionadas à forte chuva desta quinta. Foram 11 quedas de árvores e cinco de galhos. Não há registro de feridos. Parte dos galhos caiu no Bosque dos Jequitibás e o local de lazer será aberto ao público mais tarde nesta sexta, a partir das 12h, para o trabalho de limpeza e liberação da pista de caminhada. Segundo a prefeitura, houve dois pontos de alagamento e o Centro de Saúde Anchieta precisou suspender temporariamente o serviço de vacinação por problemas em uma geladeira devido à oscilação de energia. A chuva também causou transtornos em cidades do Paraná. De acordo com a Defesa Civil de Morretes, mais de 20 famílias tiveram suas casas atingidas e ocorreram diversas quedas de árvore em vias públicas. Algumas regiões do município estão sem fornecimento de energia.",

    "text": "\"The number of equipment units hit by our fighters since the beginning of the ground aggression exceeded 825. Those include armored personnel carriers, tanks, bulldozers, military vehicles and trucks,\" Al Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obaida stated in a video message broadcast by Al Jazeera. On October 7, Hamas launched a large-scale rocket attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip, while its fighters breached the border, opening fire on the military and civilians. As a result, over 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 others abducted. Israel launched retaliatory strikes, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza and launched a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave with the declared goal of eliminating Hamas fighters and rescuing the hostages. Over 21,300 people have been killed so far in Gaza as a result of Israeli strikes, local authorities said. On November 24, Qatar mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas on a temporary truce and the exchange of some of the prisoners and hostages, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire was extended several times and expired on December 1. https://sputnikglobe.com/20231115/hamas-remains-intact-despite-israeli-operation-in-gaza-1114973626.html israel gaza strip",
