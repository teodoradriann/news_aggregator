    "title": "Trasporti, il grido dei sindacati: \"I turni? Assegnati sul fotofinish. Nessun rispetto per gli autisti\"",
    "text": "Sorrentino (Orsa Trasporti): \"Servizio scolastico, gli orari di lavoro sono stati pubblicati tre giorni prima. Nessuno ha potuto organizzarsi\". La replica di Seta: \"Ritardi causati dalla carenza di personale\".\nModena, 13 settembre 2024 – \"E anche quest’anno si ripete lo stesso copione...\".\nA pochi giorni dall’avvio del servizio scolastico, in vigore dal 16 settembre, \"nessun autista, finoa ieri, era stato messo a conoscenza dei propri turni – tuona il sindacalista Luigi Sorrentino (Orsa) –. Turni che, per l’appunto, ci sono stati assegnati solamente tre giorni prima, dopo continue richieste e sollecitazioni. Oltre al problema dello stress, del carico di lavoro e degli stipendi bassi, si crea così anche un problema di rispetto\".\nL’assegnazione tardiva ha infatti creato ben più di un problema tra gli autisti, che si sono così ritrovati \"a vivere nel dubbio per giorni e giorni, senza avere potere decisionale sulla nostra vita – continua Sorrentino – pensiamo a tutte le mamme e i papà che con l’inizio della scuola avevano l’urgenza di pianificare le loro giornate e i loro impegni.\nEcco, per loro è stato impossibile farlo, così come lo è stato per tutti i quattrocenti autisti del territorio. Ho ricevuto moltissimi messaggi nel corso di questi giorni: i lavoratori sono infuriati\". Ma non solo. \"Nonostante i tagli alle corse, dubito che tutti i turni riusciranno a essere coperti: è chiaro che molti autisti, non potendo organizzarsi, abbiano scelto di prendere un permesso per la giornata di lunedì.\nUn’opzione che probabilmente sarebbe stata scartata se l’assegnazione fosse stata pubblicata con maggiore tempestività – continua il sindacalista – ma così, purtroppo, è un cane che si morde la coda. La cosiddetta ’fuga degli autisti’ è nota a tutti. I problemi ci sono e sono moltissimi, ma l’azienda, con questo modus operandi, non fa altro che mettere carne sul fuoco. Pensiamo a un nuovo assunto, che guadagna 1300 euro al mese e che, oltre a orari di lavoro massacranti, fino a tre giorni prima non sa nemmeno quale turno dovrà affrontare: è chiaro che preferisca cambiare mestiere\". I turni sono stati appunto assegnati giovedì sera \"ma il ritardo aveva già causato fin troppi problemi a tutti i lavoratori – conclude Sorrentino – un altro segnale tangibile di un sistema che non funziona\".\nSul tema è intervenuto anche il sindacato Usb. \"Se si chiede un diritto, come quello di conoscere semplicemente il turno di lavoro da effettuare il giorno dopo, la Direzione non riesce a dare risposte, portando alla disperazione e allo sfinimento i dipendenti che non si vedono rispettati, che non riescono a conciliare i tempi di vita e di lavoro\".\nNon ha tardato ad arrivare la replica di Seta: \"Quest’anno, purtroppo, vista la crescente situazione emergenziale di carenza di personale di SETA, è stato necessario riprogrammare l’assetto complessivo del servizio invernale del trasporto pubblico urbano di Modena nel corso del mese di agosto, mentre solitamente ciò avveniva entro la fine di luglio. Questo ritardo nella programmazione del servizio ha fatto sì che, a cascata, si allungassero anche i tempi tecnici necessari a SETA per la definizione dei turni di lavoro degli autisti, che negli anni scorsi venivano comunicati a fine agosto/inizio settembre\".\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nX\nPrint\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "It’s been a balmy start to winter so far in the Okanagan, and last Thursday, a temperature record that’s stood for over 100 years was broken in Vernon. And the new temperature record is emblematic of the past year of weather in Vernon, as 2023 was the warmest year in the city on record. According to Environment Canada, Vernon saw a high of 6.1 degrees Celsius on Dec. 28, 2023. That broke the record that was set in 1908 for Dec. 28, when the high was recorded at 5.6 C. Vernon was one of 11 B.C. communities that set a new temperature record on Dec. 28, and the only municipality in the Okanagan, according to Environment Canada. The month of December in Vernon was the fifth warmest on record since records began in 1900. The mean temperature for Vernon in December was 0.6 C. Normally, the mean temperature is -4.4 C, according to Environment Canada meteorologist Yimei Li. And looking at the entire year, Li said Vernon had its warmest year on record in 2023. The mean temperature last year was 10 C, the warmest recorded since records began in 1902, and well above the normal mean temperature of 7.7 C. “It’s been a pretty warm and dry year … (2022) was actually pretty snowy and wet,” said Li, explaining that the year before was a La Nina year and 2023 was an El Nino year, which makes for warmer and drier conditions.

    "text": "Actor Jin Young (34) once again showed off her presence as \"Suspicious Her.\" This time, it's not as a grandson, it's as a producer.\nKBS2 drama \"The Suspicious Girl\" (played by Heo Seung-min, directed by Park Yong-soon) which ended on the 23rd is a romance music growth drama in which grandmother Oh Mal-soon enjoys her brilliant heyday once again after turning into a 20-year-old Oduri overnight. It is based on the movie \"Suspicious Her\" (2014), which attracted 8.66 million viewers. Jinyoung plays Daniel Han, executive producer of Eunice Entertainment.\nJin-young, who I recently met, said, \"I think it's a really warm drama, so I don't think about anything else and I can enjoy it. There were a lot of cold days, but when it's over, I always feel sad and cool,\" he said.\nFor Jin-young, \"Suspicious Girl\" is a meaningful work. He appeared in a drama after playing the role of his grandson, Oh Mal-soon, in a movie 10 years ago. In particular, in this drama, he played a similar position to Lee Jin-wook in the movie.\nHe said, \"I was in Lee Jin-wook's senior position in the movie. I was worried if I could express this well, but the role was different, so I thought I could change it to my style, so I got to challenge myself. It's been a while since I met Lee Jin-wook while doing \"Sweet Home 2\" with him, and he reminded me of the movie. My senior said, \"Don't care about anything else and show me in your style,\" but it was the most encouraging.\"\nBut soon, \"But actually, every time I watch a movie, I get worried. I think the relaxed vibe from the experience because the senior is cool is an unattainable part. So I thought about how to look cool. I looked for movies and gifs of my seniors,\" he said.\nDebuting in the movie Miss Granny, he led the play as the lead in this film.\nJin-young said, \"It was also touching to be the main character. I thought that's how much time has passed. Ten years is a hell of a time. I felt that time has passed since I came out as a grandson in the movie, but this time I came out as a producer and produced an idol. I was comforted because I thought you lived hard.\"\nHe also said, \"I've dreamed of becoming an actor since I was young. When I was in middle school, I took a bus from Chungju to Seoul on weekends, went to take acting lessons, and went to a lot of auxiliary appearances. I also played a lot of minor roles. There were times when only the back came out, and there were times when it was edited. I longed for my face to come out a little more, and when my face started to come out little by little, I felt that I wanted to say something. There was such a longing, so the more the lines increased, the more joy there was. \"Suspicious Woman\" was a work that felt the change of my decade, so I was deeply moved,\" he said.\nHe said, \"The movie was hectic because it was my debut movie. I was scared and scared of what I was doing. It was a time to learn that acting is like this by watching Na Moon-hee and Shim Eun-kyung. It taught me a lot of lessons. In the drama, I had no choice but to expect Kim Hae-sook and Jung Ji-so's acting skills. I've been impressed since the script reading. They are really different people, but they express themselves without crossing a certain line, and I reflected on myself as I thought, \"Can I do that?\" I had a time to reflect on myself after seeing him do it perfectly,\" he said.\nAs for Jeong Ji-so, who worked with romance, he said, \"He's so nice. That's a wonderful person. I like to be nice to the other actor and talk to them like this. You have no choice but to get close naturally. \"This role is a difficult role and should be liked, but I reflected on it again when I saw Jung Ji-so, who made me feel more and more likeable,\" he praised.\nWe talked a lot about music with each other. Jiso sings better than me, but she asked me a lot. I was talking about my thoughts while practicing singing, and they took it so well. I thought this person was an all-around entertainment. You were so good. I did a musical while filming a drama. When I saw that, I thought he was a person of various charms. It's really great.\"\nSince Jinyoung has been an idol to a producer, he must have been immersed in Daniel Han's character.\nJin-young said, \"I can relate to it because it's a character who was an idol and then a producer. \"I tried to melt my experience,\" he said, \"I'm rough in dramas, but I'm weak-minded. I can't speak ill of myself. When recording, you can say exactly what you want to say, but in fact, there were times when I hated that personality because I couldn't. But when I saw the results later, I think I thought positively because everything doesn't work out just because it works out well by communicating with each other.\"\nIn fact, he said, \"The fans did, too, and I looked up the comments of the program I appeared on, and there was a comment saying, 'Please make it.' I'm getting greedy. There are some parts that are not easy, but I have a dream. If I do it, I'm really confident that I'll do well. It's a dream that sits on the back of my heart. It's a really difficult thing, but I also imagined that there would be nothing that happy if I melted the parts I thought and made them together. I don't know if I'll do it or not, but I'm in the back of my heart,\" he confessed.\nHe said he often looks for public reactions, calling himself a \"strategist style.\"\nJin-young said, \"When I watch dramas or movies, I look for a lot of things. He analyzes the data by himself while looking for all the detailed reactions. During movies and dramas, the production crew asks, \"What do you think the ratings will be tomorrow?\" While working as a producer since he was young, he communicated and communicated with the public. \"I think that if I don't grasp the needs of the public, I'll only fail, so I think I'm getting help from what I've practiced, tried, and seen so far, whether it's a drama or a movie, with that experience,\" he said.\nHe said, \"I am confident that I will persistently grasp what the public will like and what idols will like these days. \"I think I can understand the needs of music and do well according to the concept,\" he said with confidence.\nWhen asked what position Jung Ji-so would have been if he were an idol, he said, \"He's cute and cute, but he's also the main vocalist, so I feel like he's popular. There was such a person when I was a producer. \"He sings well, he's pretty, cute, and charming, so I think he's a popular member that fans like.\"\nJin-young said, \"2024 was a year for 2025,\" adding that he plans to show various sides to his fans in the new year.\nHe said, \"I think I lived rather hard in 2024. He also shot the film \"The Girl We Loved At That Time\" and the original Taiwanese film \"1977, that photo of that year.\" In a way, I wonder if it was the year for 2025. Things that I've been working hard on have continued to come out to the world this year. In a way, it was a year of preparation for 2025. I'm looking forward to how it will respond, he said. \"I'm going to release an album this year. I don't know what form it will be, but it won't be one song,\" he said with a smile.\n[YANG SO YOUNG, reporter of \"Star Today\"]",

The bags of chips affected by recall were distributed to some retail stores and e-commerce distributors in Oregon and Washington, and were available for sale beginning Nov. 3, 2024.\n\"Those with an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the recalled product,\" the FDA said in the recall notice posted Thursday.\nNo allergic reactions related to the recall have been reported, according to the notice. Additionally, no other Lay's products, flavors, sizes or variety packs are affected.\nFrito-Lay is recalling a limited number of 13 oz. bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips after being alerted by a consumer contact that the product may contain undeclared milk. FDA The recalled chips include Lay's Classic Potato Chips, in flexible 13 oz. (368.5 grams) bags with UPC code 28400 31041, a \"Guaranteed Fresh\" date of 11 Feb 2025, and one of either two manufacturing codes: 6462307xx or 6463307xx.\nGeneral guidelines from the FDA advise consumers who have purchased any recalled food to dispose of the product or return it to the retailer for a full refund.\nIn a similar event, Costco in October recalled nearly 80,000 pounds of store-brand butter because the key ingredient, milk, was missing from the product's label.\nMore from CBS News Aryan Brotherhood members get consecutive life terms for murder, racketeering Man goes missing from San Leandro mental health treatment center, believed to be at-risk Nikki Fortuato Bas sworn in as interim Oakland mayor after Sheng Thao recall Threat shuts down SF State campus; students advised to shelter in place California Amazon workers to join national Teamsters strike In: Product Recall Anne Marie Lee Anne Marie D.

No force with ill intent can break us as Sabahans. United, we will be able to withstand any attempts to undermine stability and to ensure that development can proceed unhindered,\" Hajiji said in his New Year 2024 message.\nHe added that he is touched by and grateful to the people and all like-minded supporters who have stood with the state government, believing in its sincerity to do what is best for Sabah.\n\"Let us put politics aside and discard any divisiveness that will only pull us apart. We must forge forward into the new year with resolve, united in diversity and committed to doing good in accordance with the mandate given to us by the rakyat,\" he said.\nWith the people's support, Hajiji said that the state government had made good strides in progressing its development plan, the Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ).\n\"As we enter the New Year, it is time to reflect on the past year and look forward to the new year with hope and optimism. Despite challenges in 2023, we have been steadfast in implementing the SMJ agenda and staying on course to see it through. Our commitment to growth remains unwavering,” he said.\nHajiji said the recently passed State 2024 Budget amounting to RM5.701bil is a testament to the state government's commitment to drive economic growth and development in Sabah.\n\"We have set our sights on the many opportunities the state can leverage in all sectors. We will continue to build on our successes and pursue new investment opportunities to create economic spin-offs and jobs for the people,\" he said.\nHowever, he said all these successes and plans will account for nothing without the combined effort and commitment of all as well as a conducive environment to pursue the state's development goals.\nHajiji thanked his Cabinet colleagues, civil servants and the people of Sabah for their continuous support and wishes everyone a happy and prosperous new year.\nOpen Modal ×",

Y si hubiera habido en Ucrania el cabrón de Putler no se habría atrevido a intentar invadir el país.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No estamos entendiendo, nos encaminamos lenta, pero sin pausa, a una guerra mundial y poco a poco se Irán relacionando conflictos y añadiendo piezas a la partida. Los Rusos pueden necesitar mas soldados, pero meter tropas norcoreanas va mas alla de los soldados que puedan aportar.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Efectivamente, es un aviso, los norcoreanos estan en Ucrania para aprender como combatir a la OTAN y prepararse para una guerra contra Corea del Sur\n[#6](c6#c-6) porque Lukashenko no se puede permitir perder soldados y tener un levantamiento en el país..\nPor eso toca tirar del único fanático que le daría tropas a cambio de algo,a parte de Lukashenko y Kadirov\nNo hay más.\nY supongo que si van como entrenamiento y actuar en un conflicto real, pero suerte volviendo a casa vistas* las bajas.\n[#20](c20#c-20) son 12000 de los que habla la noticia si vamos por la estimación alta*\n“ El pasado 18 de octubre, Seúl reveló que Pyongyang trasladó a 1.500 de sus soldados a Rusia para cumplir con esos objetivos. Y el miércoles 23 de octubre, la inteligencia surcoreana aumentó su estimación a 3.000, pero las investigaciones de Kiev subrayan que son al menos 12.000”\n[#1](c1#c-1) En serio crees que necesitan tropas extra?\nNo crees que más buen es un movimiento estrategico para demostrar y poner sobre la mesa los futuros posibles contendientes?\nPues yo si.\n[#7](c7#c-7) por ahora lo único que han conseguido es tocarle los huevos a Corea del Sur que se* está planteado suministrar munición a Ucrania como respuesta\nPues si las tropas son innecesarias, buena estrategia si..\n[#10](c10#c-10) creo que Corea del sur ya ha proporcionado armamento a Ucrania como todos los aliados de ee.uu.\n[#15](c15#c-15) si, pero ahora van a proporcionar más, empezando a debilitar sus propios almacenes.\n[#15](c15#c-15) no\nSolo vehículos y material no letal\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War\n[#18](c18#c-18) gracias por el aporte.\n[#15](c15#c-15) no directamente. Han vendido munición a EEUU para que estos puedan dar la suya, seguramente más antigua, a Ucrania sin comprometer los arsenales estadounidenses demasiado.\n#_22 dale la vuelta a la tortilla, siempre al positivismo\n[#27](c27#c-27) es evidente que si Rusia tiene que traer soldados de Corea la buena es que las cosas van de putisima madre. Y ojo como encima los coreanos tengan éxito, Rusia pasaría de ser el segundo mejor ejército de los que hay en Ucrania a ser el tercer mejor ejército de los que hay en Rusia\nYa es casualidad que los únicos aliados militares de Putin en el mundo sean Corea del Norte y Bielorrusia, cuando todo el mundo* sabe lo muy anticomunista y mucho anticomunista que es Putin, y que la verdadera oposición a Putin son los comunistas\n* https://www.publico.es/politica/anticomunismo-putin.html\n[#31](c31#c-31) porque no piensas como un Ruso con tu débil mentalidad occidental\nEs una maskirovka\nVeo indigno que mercenarios extranjeros luchen en un bando de una guerra civil. Sí, para mí ukranios y rusos son el mismo tipo de ruski. Me da igual quien empiece, es una traición máxima contraprestar a una potencia extranjera por matar a tus familiares lejanos. Los usas se tienen que estar descojonando, pase lo que pase, palman ruskis, desgraciados coreanos y paga Europa.\n[#26](c26#c-26) [#36](c36#c-36) propaganda. Ni Putín, ni nadie que le hubiera reemplazado o le sustituya en el futuro podrá consentir que la tribu rus corrupta ukraniana arrastre al país a una alianza bélica con potencias extranjeras. Es una traición con resultado previsible desde el origen y por eso la explotaron los belicistas americanos.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Pero qué listos son manipulando a Putler para que invadiera Ucrania.

    "text": "Bay Area crews arrived in Texas on Wednesday to help in the search for missing people after a catastrophic flood impacted the state.\nCrews from Oakland, Menlo Park and Mountain View made the journey to lend a helping hand. The Menlo Park Fire District team also included two dogs trained to detect human remains and their handlers.\n“The K-9 handlers specifically are in charge of HRD dogs, which are human remains discovery dogs,” said Harold Schapelhouman, a retired fire chief of the Menlo Park Fire District.\nAt least 120 people, including 36 children, are confirmed dead across six counties in Texas as of Wednesday.\nLarry Mynar, a disaster specialist, said teams have seen the unthinkable in the flood zone as cadaver dogs lead those on horseback to remove river areas.\n“We’ll stay until we get it done and we want them to have closure,” Mynar said.\nSchapelhouman, who’s also a founder of the National Urban Search and Rescue Program, said the goal is to bring people back to their families.\n“We go in there with big hearts and compassion, and we hope we find people if we’re at the stage where there are still people who are missing and thought to be alive and if that’s no longer the case, hopefully we bring people back to their families and allow those people some level of closure,” he said.\nUnits with Riverside, Los Angeles and Orange counties were also deployed to Texas.\n“It requires special resources and people who have the right attitude, stamina and resilience, and compassion to do this type of work,” Schapelhouman",

    "text": "A warm, dry spring has U.S. forecasters worried about the upcoming wildfire season Most of the United States is expected to see warmer-than-average temperatures this spring, federal forecasters say, with dry conditions likely in the West. That's raising concerns about wildfires, especially in parts of the Southwest, Great Plains, and the Upper Mississippi River Valley, said Jon Gottschalck, operations branch chief at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. The southern High Plains, in particular, which includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, is going to be \"quite vulnerable to high wildfire risk, especially during high wind events,\" Gottschalck said Thursday on a call with reporters. Texas recently suffered the largest wildfire in the state's history, which investigators [say was started by power lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/texas-smokehouse-creek-fire-xcel-energy.html). In the Mid-Atlantic this week, high winds [helped fuel blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/us/virginia-wv-wildfires.html) in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. NOAA [released its Spring Outlook](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/spring-outlook-warmer-for-most-of-us-wetter-in-southeast) amid a stretch of record warm weather. Last month was the [hottest February on record](https://www.noaa.gov/news/earth-just-had-its-warmest-february-on-record), and 2023 was the [hottest year ever](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/28/1221827923/2023-hottest-year-record-climate-change). High average temperatures last year were exacerbated by a strong El Niño climate pattern, which is a [natural cycle](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186098964/with-el-nino-and-climate-change-this-week-saw-some-of-the-hottest-recorded-weath) that heats water in the Pacific Ocean and raises average temperatures worldwide. Gottschalck said the effects of the current El Niño are expected to weaken through the spring. But recent heat records are part of a longer warming trend that scientists expect to continue as climate change intensifies. Global temperatures are rising because of the accumulation of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, [according to the World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that,ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record.), which is part of the United Nations. Those greenhouse gasses come from humans burning fossil fuels. \"Climate change is affecting the timing, intensity, and duration of weather events in the United States,\" Rick Spinrad, NOAA's administrator, said in a news release. Forecasters also warned of low water levels on the Mississippi River this summer because of below-average snowpack and precipitation in the Northern Plains and the Midwest. Ed Clark, director of the National Water Center, said low-flow conditions could affect navigation on the entire Mississippi River system, as well as water supplies for communities and industries. NOAA doesn't expect major flooding anywhere in the country this spring. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",
