    "text": "Nigeria | 3 hours ago\nOmon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\nPresident Bola Tinubu, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Governors Sheriff Oborevwori of Delta State, Goodwin Obaseki of Edo State, and other leaders yesterday extolled the virtues of the late Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Joseph Chike Edozien.\nIn his tribute, Tinubu described Obi Edozien as a man of impeccable integrity and monumental achievements whose legacies should be preserved and emulated.\nTinubu stated this at the Memorial Mass and Reception for the late monarch, a centenarian and 13th Asagba of Asaba, at the Saint Patrick Catholic Church, Asaba, on Friday.\nRepresented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Senator George Akume, the president noted that the late monarch had distinguished himself from very early in life to be honest, and hardworking.\nTinubu recalled that Obi Edozien attained the peak of the medicine profession in Nigeria and Africa, and became the first professor of medicine in the country.\nObi Edozien was the first indigenous name in the faculty or College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan, he pointed out, adding that the Asaba monarch deservedly was a source of inspiration to many in Nigeria and beyond.\nTinubu also recalled that when Asaba became the capital of the new state of Delta in 1991, shortly after Prof Chike Edozien ascended the throne as the Asagba, he brought his wealth of knowledge and experience to bear on the administration of his domain, and thus engendered a peaceful reign in the metropolitan city.\nAt the series of cultural events and artistic competitions to round off the royal burial activities of Asagba held in Asaba yesterday, several eminent royal fathers were fully represented, including the Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba Ewuare II, and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi.\nIn his tribute, former President Obasanjo said Obi Edozien was a rare breed of Nigerian who was indeed Asaba’s gift to Africa and the world.\nObasanjo made the assertion during the Songs and Tributes to the late Asaba monarch, one of the activities lined up as part of the programme of passage for Nigeria’s first professor of medicine, who joined his ancestors in February this year while activities to mark his 100th birthday were on.\nThe former president was among the eminent Nigerians who took time to pay glowing tribute to the Obi Edozien, with the long list including, former Delta governor, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan; the Emir of Zauzau, Zaria, Kaduna State, the traditional ruler of Ogulagha Kingdom; Arewa community in Asaba; internationally-renowned author, Chimamanda Adichie; the College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan as well as chiefs and the grandchildren of late Azagba represented by Nwanneamaka N. Edozien.\nObasanjo noted that he was in the Delta State capital not to mourn but to celebrate the life and times of the Asagba of Asaba, saying that he was by all means a continental and global icon who left legacies of virtue that are worth celebrating and emulating not only by Nigerians but across African and the world over.\nWhile thanking God for the opportunity he personally had to share and learn from Obi Edozien, Obasanjo said that Asaba and Delta State had given a great gift to Africa and the world in the person of the late Asagba, who remained passionate not only about progress in his family and Asaba but in Nigeria, Africa, and the world.\n“I am also here to thank the Edozien family, Asaba, and Delta State; it’s a great gift you have given to us in Nigeria, Africa, and the world,” Obasanjo said.\nCatholic Bishop of Issele-Uku Diocese, Most Michael Odogwu Elue, was the chief celebrant of the memorial Eucharistic Celebration.\nGovernor Obaseki as well as former governors James Ibori; Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, Speaker Momotimi Guwor, former deputy governor Chief Benjamin Elue, Senator James Manager, Senator Ned Nwoko; Obi of Owa, HRM Emmanuel Efeizomor, and business mogul, Mr. Tony Elumelu, were also among the dignitaries in attendance.\nGovernor Oborevwori, while thanking everyone who took time off to participate in the royal burial activities of the late Obi Edozien, urged the whole people of Asaba and Nigeria at large to emulate the late monarch’s good life that brought about 33 years of peaceful reign.\n“Asagba lived an exemplary life; he was a great achiever before he ascended the throne of his forefathers as the Asagba of Asaba and as the Asagba, he recorded more successes in making Asaba more prosperous.\n“As a government, and as Deltans, we will greatly miss the stabilising roles that he played as the King in charge of the host local government area to the Delta State Capital City, Asaba.”\nMr. Luis Edozien, who stood in for his older brother, Prof Anthony Edozien to appreciate the eulogies on behalf of the entire Edozien family and the widowed queen, HRM Modupe Edozien.\nWhile Chief Dr George Igie Ekhator conveyed the royal solidarity message of the Benin monarch, Oba Muraina Adebayo Asoya of Ife-Asoya, Ife brought the goodwill of the Ooni, urging the children of the late Asagba and the people of Asaba to “be happy and joyous” because Obi Edozien is deservedly being celebrated for a life well spent in all ramifications.\nRelated Articles",

    "text": "\nWhat's Making Us Happy: A guide to your weekend viewing, reading and listening\nPrimary Content\nThis week,\nMickey Mouse became a murderous freak, and Disney couldn't do anything about it; someone finally \"beat\" Tetris; and Katt Williams accused Steve Harvey of plagiarism and referred to him as \"Mr. Potato Head\" – amidst many, many other bold and brash proclamations.\nHere's what the NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour crew was paying attention to — and what you should check out this weekend.\nFad Camp podcast\nFad Camp is a podcast hosted by comedians Conor Dowling and Grace Mulvey, both of whom have struggled with body acceptance and diet culture. In each episode, they look at a topic related to fatness or anti-fatness, and they dissect it and laugh at it. They've done episodes on The Biggest Loser, wedding diets, Revenge Body with Khloé Kardashian and, of course, fat camps for children. What I love about Fad Camp is that Conor and Grace are intellectually certain about how anti-fatness is damaging — and yet they're still vulnerable enough to admit that they sometimes struggle with their own body acceptance. It's information mixed with vulnerability and humor. It always makes me laugh and think. — Kristen Meinzer\nSilver Nitrate, by Silvia Moreno-Garcia\nSilver Nitrate by Silvia Moreno-Garcia came out in July 2023. It's about two best friends living in Mexico City in the early '90s. They work in and around the film and television industry, and they get wrapped up in a spooky mystery involving a Nazi occultist and a secret film that was never released and might contain all sorts of untold dark powers. Because it's the '90s, there's no Internet or smartphones; the two characters have to get to the bottom the mystery by doing research in dusty film archives and looking in the phone book. It has a nostalgic, Nancy Drew quality to it that I loved. If you like The Vampire Diaries TV series this will scratch that itch. — Wailin Wong\nThe monologue in Barbie\nThis is the\nmuch-discussed moment in Barbie when America Ferrera's character, Gloria, holds forth for a couple of minutes about the contradictions of the expectations that are placed on women. Plenty of people I respect have dismissed it as eye-rolling, and cringe, and Feminism 101, and too basic, and a gross oversimplification, and a dumbing down of important issues and ideas.\nI spent a couple days over the holiday break with a friend of ours: She's in her 60s. She would never consider herself a feminist; she calls herself \"a tough broad.\" The minute she saw me, she asked me about Barbie, which was odd because she doesn't watch movies. I have known this person 20 years — we have never talked about pop culture.\nShe said she rewound and rewatched that speech three times. She quoted it to me at length. She had never heard her life expressed in such a stark, and succinct, and, yes, simplified way. This was a reminder for me that critics can get jaded. For a moment, my friend felt like her experiences weren't unique to her. And given the success of Barbie there must be a lot of people who had an experience like that. And I just think it's myopic to dismiss it. — Glen Weldon\nMore recommendations from the Pop Culture Happy Hour newsletter\nby Aisha Harris\nI care about Travis Kelce as much as I care about football, which is to say: not at all. But this New York Times article gives an interesting peek into the\n well-oiled machine behind his ascendance into the zeitgeist, and is a necessary reminder that in the entertainment world, some things, like dating the biggest pop star in the world, happen [allegedly] by chance. Others are carefully crafted plans years in the making.\nSpeaking of carefully crafted plans, multi-level marketing schemes are the worst, right? And yet, many of us can't get enough stories about them, be they exposés, documentaries, or podcasts, myself included. If this sounds like you, definitely check out\n the latest season of The Dream, hosted by Jane Marie. It's about the insidiousness of MLMs, but also includes a deep dive into the history of \"bootstrap\" mentality.\nAnd finally,\nDan Levy's feature directorial debut Good Grief is streaming on Netflix this weekend. It's a melancholy, wintry rom-com-dramedy that features a standout performance by Ruth Negga as one of his character's B.F.F.s. Will go down pleasingly enough with a warm blanket and a glass of red or a hot cocoa. Beth Novey adapted the Pop Culture Happy Hour segment \"What's Making Us Happy\" for the Web.

    "text": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände“\nEine Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz beschreibt bei Ippen.Media, woran es in Deutschlands Schulen fehlt - samt Forderungen an Kanzler Friedrich Merz.\nBerlin - Am Dienstag (24. Juni) war es so weit. Die schwarz-rote Bundesregierung aus CDU/CSU und SPD hat ihren Entwurf für den Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorgelegt. Darin sind im Umfeld von Ukraine-Krieg und Russland-Aggression nicht zuletzt immense Verteidigungsausgaben zur Aufrüstung der Bundeswehr enthalten.\nSchulen in Deutschland: Thema Bildung ging im Bundestagswahlkampf unter\nBis zu 95 Milliarden Euro sollen in die deutschen Streitkräfte fließen. Die Verteidigungspolitik war schließlich auch ein zentrales Thema im Wahlkampf zur Bundestagswahl 2025. Ganz im Gegensatz zur Bildung allgemein und zu Schulen im Speziellen. Dabei wird seit Jahren über eklatante Versäumnisse in der Ausstattung deutscher Bildungseinrichtungen berichtet.\nZum Beispiel bei ausreichend und zeitgemäßen digitalen Geräten. Im Umfeld von Bundeshaushalt und schwarz-roten Plänen für Deutschland hat die Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz auf Anfrage der Frankfurter Rundschau von Ippen.Media jetzt „gravierende Missstände“ benannt. Sie stellt eindringliche Forderungen an die Koalition von Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) und Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil (SPD).\nBildung in Deutschland: Expertin berichtet von Missständen an deutschen Schulen\n„Die Missstände an deutschen Schulen sind vielerorts gravierend und sie ziehen sich durch nahezu alle Bereiche: Vom akuten Lehrkräftemangel, über unzureichende digitale Infrastruktur bis hin zu baulichen Mängeln, die zum Teil gesundheitsgefährdend sind. Es ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schülerinnen und Schüler in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden“, erklärt Tilda Skerra – „Wenn überhaupt Lehrkräfte zur Verfügung stehen“. Digitale Endgeräte würden ebenso fehlen wie stabiles WLAN oder zeitgemäße Lernumgebungen, schildert sie.\nSkerra ist Mitglied im Bundessekretariat der Bundesschülerkonferenz (BSK), die sich als Vertretung von Schülerinnen und Schülern der Bildungspolitik in Deutschland annimmt. Und zwar bei Themen von überregionaler Bedeutung. So sollen Anliegen von Schülern und Schülerinnen bundesweit Gehör verschafft werden, während für das Thema Bildung im deutschen Föderalismus vorrangig die Bundesländer zuständig sind.\nEs ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schüler*innen in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden.\nDie Kulturhoheit der Länder im Bildungsbereich ist im Grundgesetz verankert. Der Bund nimmt durch Fördermittel und Subventionen, etwa bei Bauvorhaben, aber sehr wohl erheblichen Einfluss auf die Bildungspolitik und kann die Länder je nach Gewichtung des Themas bei der Budgetierung erheblich entlasten - oder eben nicht.\nSondervermögen der schwarz-roten Koalition: Schüler-Vertreter fordern viel mehr Geld von Merz\nNach Ansicht von Skerra und ihrer Mitstreiter kommen aus Berlin zu wenige Signale und vor allem zu wenig Geld, um frühere Versäumnisse anzugehen und bestenfalls zu beheben. „Wir fordern, dass mindestens zehn Prozent des geplanten Infrastruktur-Sondervermögens, also rund 50 Milliarden Euro, zweckgebunden in die Sanierung und Modernisierung von Schulen investiert werden“, erklärt Skerra unserer Redaktion. „Darüber hinaus braucht es ein langfristig angelegtes Förderprogramm, das die bauliche, digitale und strukturelle Weiterentwicklung unserer Schulen strategisch begleitet.“\nFerner müsse der schon unter der früheren Ampel-Bundesregierung so bezeichnete „DigitalPakt deutlich aufgestockt und ausgebaut werden, um Bildung endlich nachhaltig im 21. Jahrhundert anzukommen zu lassen“, meint die Expertin. Zu weiteren Forderungen der Bundesschülerkonferenz gehört die Sicherstellung der Finanzierung von verpflichtenden Fort- und Weiterbildungsbereichen, was etwa die Themen „mentale Gesundheit“ und „digitale Lehrformate“ betreffe. Und ein realistischer Betreuungsschlüssel, wie es die BSK-Sprecherin beschreibt: „Mindestens eine Schulsozialarbeiterin oder ein Schulsozialarbeiter auf 300 Schüler*innen und auf 150 Schüler*innen eine Schulpsychologin oder ein Schulpsychologe je Bundesland.“\nLars Klingbeil stellt Bundeshaushalt 2025 vor: Bildungsausgaben steigen leicht\nDas alles gebe es bislang nicht. Die Investitionen in die Bildung, die Vize-Kanzler Klingbeil im Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorstellte, dürften bei den Experten aus dem Bereich jedoch für überschaubare Begeisterung sorgen. Laut Website des Bundesfinanzministeriums entfallen von 488,60 Milliarden Euro aus dem Regierungsentwurf gerade mal 4,57 Prozent auf die Themen Bildung und Forschung - rund 22,31 Milliarden Euro.\nDas ist ein leichter Anstieg. Zum Vergleich: Die gescheiterte Ampel-Bundesregierung hatte für 2024 noch 21,49 Milliarden Euro eingeplant. Laut Bundesfinanzministerium sollen aus dem Sondervermögen zudem insgesamt 6,5 Milliarden Euro in Investitionen für die Kindertagesbetreuung und in die digitale Bildung fließen. In einem Zeitraum bis 2029. Von den geforderten 50 Milliarden Euro der BSK ist das weit entfernt. (pm)",

Beirut (Líbano), 26 sep (EFE).- En el patio de uno de los colegios habilitados como albergues para los miles de desplazados en Beirut, un grupo de niños se entretiene jugando al fútbol mientras los adultos hablan de la destrucción \"inimaginable\" y los bombardeos \"indiscriminados\" que dejaron atrás en el sur del Líbano. Más de medio millar de centros como este acogen ya a 70.100 personas que en los últimos días han huido de una campaña de ataques israelíes sin precedentes, principalmente desde la región meridional, como una anciana albergada en esta escuela junto a su hija y dos de sus nietos. La mujer, que como casi todos prefiere no revelar su nombre, reconoce que no esperaba salir con vida del infierno que estalló en su aldea el pasado martes.
