    "title": "Was Raisi’s Death a Sovereign Act of God? - Charisma News",
    "text": "It really makes you wonder when you look back at Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s statement of April 23rd, less than a month ago, as he threatened Israel with annihilation. It was during a visit to Pakistan that Raisi referred to Israel as the “Zionist regime,” whose destruction he promised if they would dare to attack Iran. Because when thinking about the Biblical accounts of cause and effect, it’s only natural to make the comparison of someone who, after threatening the Jews, ended up hanging on his own gallows. But who was Ebrahim Raisi, and is it possible to connect his sudden and unexpected demise to a sovereign act of God – even in the year 2024? At age 63, Raisi, whose full name was Raisolsadati, was the son-in-law of a prominent Imam. He became Iran’s eighth president in 2021. As a prosecutor and Deputy Chief Justice of Iran, he rose to prominence as the country’s president when appointed by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Earning for himself a fearsome reputation, he was labeled “The Butcher of Tehran,” “responsible for the execution of thousands of political prisoners, accused of crimes against humanity by international human rights organizations and United Nations special rapporteurs.” You’d be hard-pressed to find an individual who was more of a hardliner in Iranian politics than Raisi, and, perhaps, that accounts for the remark made by IDF Intelligence Chief Major General Tamir Hayman who commented, upon hearing his demise, that “it would be hard to find someone worse.” Breaking News . Spirit-Filled Stories . Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now! But it wasn’t only in April that Raisi threatened Israel’s existence. He made that same promise back in May 2023 when he, once again, warned Israel not to “launch a direct military strike on his country which would be overwhelmed and destroyed by Iran’s immediate response.” Always referring to Israel as the “Zionist regime,” it was Raisi’s intent to smear the Jewish homeland as an entity that had no right to exist, due to its foundational belief that there should be a protective refuge for all Jews who, for thousands of years, never had the security of knowing if they’d be banished from their host countries or even worse. As the mouthpiece for the Islamic Republic’s supreme leader, Khamenei, he would voice his threats, using his legal training, something which a cleric was incapable of doing but probably considered effective by the same man who appointed him to the office in which he served over the course of three years. The man who donned a black turban, signifying lineage to the prophet Mohammed, was notorious for terrifying the Iranian people, who suffered tremendously under his suffocating grip. Ruling with a tight fist, he made sure no one got out of line, putting an end to rising protests that erupted from time to time. In fact, it was during the period when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, died following her arrest, for not adhering to the strict hijab rules of the country, that Raisi cracked down on the ensuing protests that arose by many Iranians, especially women, who saw Amini’s death as the ultimate price paid for the freedom which had been taken from them. Even though all opposition was quelled, there, nonetheless, remained a large, seething resistance by many of the Iranian people, who have lived under the hand of tyranny since the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown in 1979 and Iran became an extreme Islamic state. So, one can only wonder how Iranian citizens are feeling on the morning after their greatest oppressor has fallen. Which raises the question – what should we think when a cataclysmic, game-changing event, such as the sudden death of a tyrant takes place, at a time when it almost appeared as if he held the fate of Israel in his hand? For one thing, Raisi’s death serves as a much-needed reminder that no man, regardless of how powerful, threatening or fearful he sounds, has the ability to override the plans and purposes of God, Almighty who established Israel and has sustained her throughout 2,000 years of dispersion to the four corners of the earth, returning her back to the land which He promised them!

History has shown us that when individuals rise up, with the express goal of eliminating the Jews, it is those very people who end up in the dustbin of the ages, confirming that there is only one Sovereign Master whose authority is unrivaled and unparalleled. To attempt the usurping of that place is to ensure one’s own swift end, and that is why the timing of Raisi’s death comes into question, just weeks after he took it upon himself to stand in the place of the divine Creator! In fact, there is a Biblical account, found in the prophetic book of Daniel, which has startling similarities to this Raisi story. It unfolds in the fifth chapter when Belshazzar, the then king of Babylon gives orders to drink wine from the sanctified temple vessels – representing an act of defiance to the Most High God. It was what followed that act of desecration that bears the resemblance to today’s incident. “Suddenly, the fingers of a man’s hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. The king’s face grew pale and his knees began knocking together.” After summoning Daniel, the prophet began by recalling that Belshazzar’s father, King Nebuchadnezzar’s “heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, causing him to be deposed from his royal throne and having his glory taken away from him.” He went on to say that, just as his father, he, too, did not humble his heart, knowing what fate had unfolded upon his father as a result. The inscription read, “God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it. You have been weighed on the scales and found deficient. Your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.” That very night, the king met his end. The lesson to be learned, here, is that whenever someone dares to arrogantly take the place of God, they should be prepared to face the consequences. So, yes, it’s entirely possible that the death of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi was a sovereign act of God which resulted from his defiance of the Almighty who is the giver and taker of life – not solely of people, but of governments, leaders and countries as well. No one and nothing can override or revoke God’s promise to guard and protect Israel from those who would destroy her, because it’s important to remember that “He who touches Israel, touches the apple of His eye” (Zech. 2:8).

    "text": "[Bogotá](/cronologia/-/meta/bogota) BÓGOTA. El cantante colombiano Ryan Castro estrenó su nuevo sencillo ‘El cantante del ghetto’, un tema de salsa con el que hace un homenaje a Héctor Lavoe y que es el primer sencillo del que será su álbum debut, informó este jueves la disquera Sony Music. Este tema, estrenado en las últimas horas junto a un video musical en el que Castro sale vestido como el salsero puertorriqueño, cuenta con la participación de la orquesta La Eterna y el productor COQE. El álbum, que también lleva el nombre del nuevo sencillo, será el primero de estudio de Castro después de siete años de carrera y éxitos con sencillos como ‘Wasa Wasa’, ‘Mujeriego’ y ‘Monastery’. El artista, oriundo del municipio de Bello, sólo había lanzado tres EP al mercado: ‘Reggeatonea’ y ‘Los Piratas’, junto a su productor principal, SOG, ambos de 2022, y ‘El Pichón’ de 2023. “El proyecto mostrará su esencia musical de dancehall, rap y reguetón, que han moldeado a Ryan para convertirse en el artista global que es hoy en día”, agregó Sony Music en un comunicado. ‘El cantante del ghetto’, que contará con 18 canciones, entre las que se encuentra el éxito ‘Quema’ junto al mexicano Peso Pluma, estará disponible el próximo 9 de mayo en todas las plataformas digitales.",

    "title": "Thinking of Teaching Your Kid to Ski? These Tools Can Help.",
    "text": "Teaching your young kids to ski can feel daunting. Heck, getting young kids to the mountain, dressed properly , and clicked into their skis can be daunting, let alone teaching them to ski. We’re here to help.\nBut first things first: How do you know your kiddo is ready? We asked Brian and Aleks Smith, PSIA instructors at Aspen Snowmass and parents of two daughters. The Smiths work with the youngest sliders all winter, and what’s more, they went through the process of introducing the sport to their own girls not too long ago. In other words, the instructor pair is a wealth of information when it comes to the how and when to get the groms sliding.\n Related: Renting vs. Buying Kids Ski Gear\nMost kids are ready to hit the slopes between the ages of 3 and 4, says Aleks Smith, but some 2-year-olds may already be interested and able. One thing to look for is the ability to balance, says Smith, e.g., riding a pushbike or playing soccer or other sports. The other thing is interest: Do they want to try skiing?\nOnce you’ve determined that your child is ready, one option Smith recommends is using props. “Many parents choose to use tools to aid in their children’s skill development,” Smith says. “If used properly, these tools can be useful.” The props Smith reaches for most often are the harness, the Edgie Wedgie, and the Hula Hoop. Here, Smith walks us through how to use each prop safely and successfully.\nWatch: See How to Use These Tools to Teach Your Young Kids to Ski\nProp: Hula Hoop She looks like a pro! ( Photo courtesy of Bailey LaRue) Age : 2-3 Indication : Child is struggling to maintain balance while sliding $14 at Amazon\nThe idea here is to teach young kids to stand independently while sliding forward and resist the urge to lean back. Slip the hoop around the child’s waist and hold onto the back of it. You’re in control, while the child feels the sensation of sliding.\nNo longer needed : When the child isn’t leaning against the front of the hoop Prop: Edgie Wedgie Age : 2-5 Indication : Child is having trouble keeping his tips together $11.90 at Amazon\nThis simple device can help you avoid major on-slope meltdowns. (Photo: Courtesy of Edgie Wedgie) Making a wedge can be difficult for kids five and under, as they often don’t have the leg strength to hold their skis in that position. That’s where the Edgie Wedgie comes in. This device easily attaches and detaches to the tips of the child’s skis. Ashe stretches the Edgie Wedgie, his skis will naturally form a wedge; the bigger the stretch, the wider the wedge. Once the child understands the shape and knows what it feels like to arrange his skis just so, he should be able to start to wedge without the Edgie Wedgie.\nNo longer needed : When the child isn’t stretching it while turning or stopping Prop: Harness The harness is great for giving kids—and parents—a little extra confidence, especially on crowded slopes. (Photo: Courtesy of Lucky Bums) Age : 2-6 Indication : Child can’t stop on her own or is nervous $33.40 at Amazon\nA harness is a great tool for very young kids who haven’t figured out the wedge stop. It can be tricky to put on properly, so be sure to read the directions. The idea is to keep your little skier in front of you as you descend very gentle terrain, holding the straps with some slack. Don’t ever tug on the straps, or you can throw the child off balance.\nNo longer needed : When the child can stop on her own",

    "title": "Цены на обучение в Украине в 2025 году - Экономическая правда",
    "text": "Стоимость обучения в украинских университетах существенно выросла. Какие цены?\n1 июля в Украине уже традиционно начинается вступительная кампания. Какие университеты и направления чаще всего выбирают украинские студенты и сколько стоит обучение?\nВступительная кампания-2025 начинается уже с 1 июля - именно с этого дня для абитуриентов открывается регистрация в электронном кабинете абитуриента. Прием заявлений о поступлении начинается 19 июля и продлится до 1 августа. В целом сервис будет работать до 20 октября (в это время приходят приказы о зачислении, дополнительный набор на контракт, дополнительные волны о зачислении и т.д.).\nПоэтому, у поступающих еще есть два месяца, чтобы выбрать желаемую специальность. Часто одним из критериев выбора будущей профессии становится стоимость обучения, ведь если пройти \"на бюджет\" не удастся, нужно понимать, хватит ли денег на контракт.\nСколько стоит обучение в самых популярных университетах Украины в 2025 году и как менялись цены?\nСамые популярные университеты Украины и специальности\nЕжегодно по итогам вступительной кампании Министерство образования и науки публикует ее результаты - количество поданных заявлений, топ университетов и специальностей, на которые подавалось больше всего абитуриентов.\nПо итогам 2024 года в пятерку лучших высших учебных заведений вошли Национальный университет \"Львовская политехника\", Львовский национальный университет им. Ивана Франко, Киевский национальный университет им. Тараса Шевченко, Киевский политехнический институт им. Игоря Сикорского (КПИ) и Государственный торгово-экономический университет.\nСуммарно в указанные выше университеты в прошлом году абитуриенты подали более 146 тыс. заявок. В целом по стране в высшие учебные заведения поступило 753 тыс. заявок.\nПо сравнению с 2023 годом, список самых популярных университетов практически не изменился - только Киевский авиационный институт (бывший НАУ) и Государственный торгово-экономический университет поменялись местами.\nРейтинг самых популярных специальностей составляет Минобразования, опираясь на количество поданных заявлений. Вступительная кампания 2024 года показала следующие результаты:\n- \"Психология\" (54 394 заявлений);\n- \"Менеджмент\" (54 094);\n- \"Филология\" (45 682);\n- \"Право\" (44 286);\n- \"Компьютерные науки\" (36 409).\nЭта пятерка остается неизменной на протяжении последних нескольких лет. Меняется только расположение специальностей. Например, в 2024 году резко увеличилось количество желающих учиться на психологии и менеджменте, а в предыдущие два года эти направления замыкали пятерку лидеров.\nЗаместитель министра образования и науки Михаил Винницкий в интервью \"Украинскому радио\" рассказывал, что сейчас есть определенное количество специальностей, которые называют \"конъюнктурными\". На них подаются много абитуриентов, но после окончания обучения они не находят себя на рынке труда.\nК таким специальностям чиновник относит право, экономику, менеджмент, туризм, ресторанный бизнес, журналистику и даже стоматологию.\nЧитайте также:\n[Как поступить в вуз и ничего не пропустить: пошаговый маршрут для абитуриентов]\n\"Мы уменьшаем количество государственных мест на такие специальности и одновременно увеличиваем цену контракта. Это касается именно тех специальностей, которые не обеспечивает рынок труда. Поэтому не думайте, что весь контракт должен стать недоступным. Это не так\", - подчеркнул заместитель министра.\nЗато Украине нужны специалисты, связанным с человеческим капиталом, говорят в МОН. \"Медики, учителя, терапевты-реабилитологи - это три специальности, которые чрезвычайно важны. Могу добавить еще четвертую - психология\", - отметил Винницкий.\nКроме человеческого капитала, важна также инфраструктура - фактически, все, что касается архитектуры, строительства, различных инженерных специальностей, энергетики, автотранспорта, авиации, беспилотной инженерии и тому подобное.\nНа фундаментальные специальности - физика, химия, биология, геодезия, экология, землеустройство и т.д. - есть относительно малое количество поступающих. А потребности рынка труда, наоборот, большие.\nСколько стоит обучение в топ-университетах\nВ 2025/2026 учебном году на бакалавриате больше всего придется заплатить за \"Менеджмент\" в Киевском национальном университете им. Тараса Шевченко - от 312,8 тыс. грн за весь четырехлетний курс (на 45% больше, чем по ценам прошлого года). За год студенту надо заплатить от 78,2 тыс. грн в зависимости от образовательной программы.\nПрошлогодним лидером по стоимости обучения была специальность \"Право\" в том же КНУ (264 тыс. грн). В 2025 году четырехлетний курс уже стоит 306,4 тыс. грн (рост на 16%).\nДля оценки стоимости образования выбрались пять самых популярных специальностей в пяти самых популярных высших учебных заведениях. Все цены указаны сразу за четыре года обучения на дневной форме.\nВо Львовской политехнике \"Менеджмент\" также существенно подорожал по сравнению с прошлым годом. Четыре года обучения обойдутся студенту в 227,2 тыс. грн, и это на 78,6% дороже чем предлагалось в 2024 году.\nВо Львовском университете им. Франко среди наиболее популярных специальностей самыми дорогими будут \"Право\" и \"Компьютерные науки\" - по 267 тыс. грн.\nВ КПИ среди популярных специальностей дороже всего стоит получить юридическое и менеджментское образования: 270,4 тыс. грн за все обучение или 67,6 тыс. грн на один год. Более того, второе образование по сравнению с прошлым годом подорожало на 54%.\nВ Государственном торгово-экономическом университете стоимость обучения заметно отличается от предыдущих четырех \"топов\". Окончить \"Менеджмент\" и \"Право\" обойдется в 168,8 тыс. грн, остальные популярные специальности - по 152 тыс. грн.\nВ начале мая Винницкий рассказывал, что в прошлом учебном году средняя стоимость контракта по стране составляла примерно 35-38 тысяч гривен. В этом году ожидали уже под 50 тыс. грн - примерно столько, сколько и выделяет государство на подготовку одного бюджетника.\n\"Мы понимаем, что такая стоимость контракта для многих наших граждан является непосильной. Именно поэтому часть этой стоимости компенсирует государство через гранты\", - отметил заместитель министра.\nПолучить грант можно в размере 15-16 тыс. грн. То есть если раньше контрактник самостоятельно платил условно 38 тыс. грн, то сейчас, при повышенной стоимости, он будет платить 35 тыс. грн плюс грант. \"В таком случае и стоимость обучения увеличивается, и государство поддерживает сильных абитуриентов\", - подчеркнул Винницкий.",

    "text": "The Taoiseach said negatives experiences are not the norm in the Irish capital. Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted. Leo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital. There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city. That scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school. Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected. Mr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists. “There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world. “But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places. “(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.” Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country. “Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else. “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",

    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n今年全国两会期间，有代表建议，北京中轴线申遗成功标志着其保护发展进入新阶段，在新阶段宜以“城市复兴”为导向推进中轴线遗产保护，引发关注。\n作为世界文化遗产，北京中轴线是由众多文化遗产组成的文化整体，集中表达了中华文化精神，其对加强历史文化名城保护、推进全国文化中心建设等具有关键作用。北京中轴线数百年的历史文脉，孕育了丰富多样的历史遗迹、民间文化、艺术作品，是文化资源的现实载体。开掘与整理北京中轴线衍生的文化资源，是文化传承的核心要旨。整合北京中轴线的文化资源，要充分观照文化资源在表现样态、历史背景、社会知名度等方面的现实差异，创新方式实现文化传承。\n其一，兼顾有形与无形。北京中轴线所承载的文化资源中，不仅有宏大的文化遗迹、历史建筑，还包括众多无形的文化财富。比如天坛神乐署中和韶乐等传统音乐，天桥摔跤、中幡等表演艺术，厂甸庙会承载的京味文化，老字号为代表的饮食习俗与传统商俗等，都生动还原了北京中轴线的文化风貌与民众生活。\n其二，兼采历史与当下。这要求我们既关注北京中轴线的传统文化资源，同时重视北京中轴线的当代发展。老舍于20世纪50年代以金鱼池地区居民生活为背景创作的《龙须沟》、刘心武于20世纪80年代聚焦钟鼓楼周边民众生活而创作的长篇小说《钟鼓楼》等，都可见北京中轴线与当代城市发展、市民生活的互动。\n其三，兼容闻名与无名。北京中轴线上，有一些文化遗存举世闻名，不过还有一批不广为人知却寓意深远。如正阳门，它不仅是北京城门中规模最大、等级最高的建筑，也是北京雨燕的安身之所。每年夏季，北京雨燕飞越万里，前往南非高原过冬，并于次年春季归来，正阳门城楼的梁、檩、椽，正是它们的“家园”。“燕”是北京的历史地名和文化标志，跨越万里的北京雨燕展现的惊人毅力与拼搏奋进，象征着生活在这座城市里的人们的品格。“北京雨燕”常被用作重大活动与大型赛事的图标，但北京中轴线上的雨燕故事却鲜为人知。这提示我们，在整合文化资源的过程中，要注重挖掘并转化这些彰显城市精气神的文化符号。\n创新北京中轴线保护利用，要积极运用科学技术赋能文化遗产保护，实现传统文脉的继承和发展。令人欣喜的是，数字技术深度融入北京中轴线申遗工作，并开发搭建“数字打更人”“数字中轴·小宇宙”等公众线上活动参与平台。“数字打更人”创新性地为公众提供了参与平台，人们通过“随手扫码、随手拍”的方式，就可以将历史文物的数据实时传送到遗产监测平台，让市民、游客有机会化身为北京中轴线的守护者，深度参与文化遗产的保护。游戏“数字中轴·小宇宙”则融合了高清照扫、游戏引擎、实时头发物理模拟、实时动态全局光照方案等技术，在线上“复现”了北京中轴线的核心遗产区。我们要在已有成果的基础上，秉持更高的设计标准，进一步探索保护和传承北京中轴线价值的科技手段与方式。\n创新北京中轴线保护利用，还需不断拓宽“北京中轴线”文化IP的利用路径，创新北京中轴线文化资源的表现形式。近年来，众多以北京中轴线为主题的文化展览、文艺展演、视听作品问世，取得了良好的社会反响。其中，首都博物馆策划的“辉煌中轴”历史文化展，借助丰富的文物展品、图片资料以及现代化展示手段，让更多观众理解北京中轴线的文化精髓；北京民族乐团演奏的民族管弦乐组曲《中轴》，吸收了清代宫廷音乐、北京民间音调，以及钟鼓楼报时特征等北京中轴线的声音要素，用民族音乐呈现出北京中轴线的独特魅力……创新无止境，我们应持续创新，深化多媒介、多渠道、多维度的表现形式，更充分展现“北京中轴线”文化IP所蕴含的文化意蕴和当代价值。\n创新北京中轴线保护利用，还需加速推进文旅融合，拓展消费场景，打造全链条文旅业态。北京中轴线关联大运河等世界文化遗产、恭王府等旅游景区以及百余项国家级、市级非物质文化遗产项目，集中展现了古都文化、红色文化、京味文化，具有极高的文旅资源禀赋。应当深挖北京中轴线蕴含的时代价值，整合区域内优势资源，推出主题游、个性游、深度游等文化探访线路，满足不同群体的个性化需求，提升其旅游体验，进一步做好、做热、做旺以北京中轴线为代表的世界文化遗产旅游产品，在整体阐释、发扬古都北京的文化精神的同时，打造全新文化品牌，助推文博、文创、文旅等行业一体化发展，加速构建北京中轴线的全链条文旅业态。\n（作者：王子尧、王卫华，分别系中央民族大学文学院博士研究生，中央民族大学文学院教授）\n（责任编辑：武晓娟）",
