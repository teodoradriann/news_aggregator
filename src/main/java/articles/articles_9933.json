    "text": "[Maui News](https://mauinow.com/category/maui_news/) Rare Kauaʻi plant highlights endangered species recovery efforts Its scientific name is Cyanea rivularis. In the mountains of Kaua‘i it produces conical-shaped lavender and white flowers, which like many endangered plant species across the state, are key components to a fully functioning and healthy native ecosystem. As the 50th anniversary of the federal Endangered Species Act is celebrated this month, the Endangered Species Coalition chose Hawai‘i’s Plant Extinction Prevention Program as one of 10 outstanding efforts to recognize. This was based on the discovery of a rare plant, Silene lanceolata, discovered by PEPP technician Susan Deans, last year, while rappelling on a remote cliffside. Matt Keir is the DOFAW lead for the PEPP program, which marks its 20th year of existence this year. Continued existence is what it’s all about, as the program’s target list contains more than 260 rare and endangered Hawaiian plants. “We have almost half of all endangered plants in the United States. So, the level of rarity in Hawai‘i is unsurpassed anywhere else in the world. Plants make the list when fewer than 50 individual plants remain in the wild. PEPP has been incredibly successful in getting to plants before they go totally extinct. After two decades of work, we have seen about 30 different species go extinct in the wild but saved through cultivation and that’s been our biggest success,” Keir said. The PEPP team on Kaua‘i is currently involved in an ambitious project to supplement the population of only three wild Cyanea rivularis plants left, with 2,500 cultivated plants at five different sites. Scott Heintzman, Kauaʻi PEPP Field Coordinator said, “Plants in the sites we’ve covered so far are doing great. We’ve maybe lost only two plants of 700 that are out now. Already, native honeycreeper birds are interacting with the plants and cross-pollinating individuals so we’re really seeing a rebound of this species. Itʻs doing great.” At the DLNR Division of Forestry and Wildlife mid-elevation rare plant nursery in the Koke‘e area, Keir, Heintzman, and PEPP Technician Susan Deans walk between rows of rare young plants. They identify each of them by their scientific names and indicate how many wild ones remain. Two here, five there, a couple dozen in other cases. Deans said, “We don’t really consider the plants we bring from the nursery to be wild. The goal is for those plants to reproduce and then for seedlings to pop up underneath them, and then we would consider those to be wild. The goal is to create self-sustaining, healthy populations of species back into areas where they were once abundant. That happens once they’ve removed threats that knocked off wild plants in the first place.” Those threats include ungulates like pigs, which are kept out of sensitive re-planting areas by predator-proof fencing. When asked why people should care about these rare, native plants, Heintzman said, “The easy answer is that we don’t really know what these plants can do for us as a human race in the future. We don’t know if these can contribute to science or medicine. Not only that, but a lot of these plants are also culturally significant. They were part of the Hawaiian toolbox, used over centuries for food and medicine. The success of the PEPP program is due to tremendous collaboration with partners like Lyon Arboretum, which takes in seeds for propagation and storage. Keir said, “The best thing about this program has been the staff and partners. We work with an incredible group of talented people who are dedicated to doing really difficult field work. These people are the best of the best, who have dedicated their lives and careers to protecting Hawai‘i.” “Helping recover these plants should be important to everyone. They are gems of creation. They’re special, beautiful plants and if we lose them, they’re gone. We’ll never get them back and that’s hard to swallow. Hawai‘i is a special place and most of these plants are found nowhere else in the world. To lose any of them is heartbreaking,” Heintzman added. Keir concluded, “We have the tools, we have the knowledge, and we know what needs to be done. It’s just a question of, can we get to enough of them in time. Building our program across the state to keep pace with the ever-increasing extinction rate in Hawai‘i is key. If PEPP can intervene in time, we can collect seeds from wild plants and get them into cultivation before they die out and then re-establish them in the future. That’s been another one of PEPP’s major milestones and successes.” Sponsored Content Comments [View Comments](#)",

    "text": "尊湃窃密华为芯片案14名前海思员工获刑，有关案件更多细节被曝光\n据多媒体报道，7月28日，上海市第三中级人民法院对尊湃侵犯华为商业秘密案件做出一审判决，前海思员工共14人被判处有期徒刑（其中5人实刑，首犯被判处有期徒刑6年），总计罚金1350万元。\n根据上海经侦ECID公众号在2023年12月21日的发文《上海警方侦破侵犯芯片技术商业秘密案》，2023年4月19日，在公安部的指挥部署下，在江苏警方的大力配合下，上海警方成功侦破一起侵犯芯片技术商业秘密案，抓获犯罪嫌疑人14名，查扣存储侵权芯片技术的服务器7台，在侵权芯片投入量产前及时予以查处。\n此前警方通报显示，2021年2月，华为海思原高管张某、刘某等人为牟取非法利益，在离职后设立某科技公司，以支付高薪、股权利诱等方式，诱导多名原权利公司研发人员跳槽至其公司，并指使这些人员在离职前通过摘抄、截屏等方式非法获取权利公司芯片技术信息，抄袭并运用于张某公司设计的同类型芯片上，企图以此非法牟利。\n经鉴定，侵权芯片技术有40个技术点与权利公司商业秘密的密点具有90%以上同一性，构成实质性相同。张某团伙的窃密行为，导致权利公司商业秘密灭失，应根据该项商业秘密的研究开发成本、实施该项商业秘密的收益等商业价值来认定造成了权利公司损失。\n芯片是电子信息产业的核心基础，企业需要投入大量人力、物力、财力和时间成本进行科技创新研发。\n华为从1995年递交首件中国专利开始，持续将大量的创新成果通过专利、标准和开源等方式向业界公开。华为在2023年新公开的专利达到3.6万件，超过了历史所有年份。截止2023年底，华为累计公开专利已经超过33.6万件，累计向国内外标准组织贡献技术提案超过13万篇，累计发表学术论文超过6000篇。OpenHarmony社区共建者提交的开源代码已经超过1.1亿行。\n2023年7月14日，上海市知识产权法院，公开了上海海思技术有限公司与尊湃通讯科技（南京）有限公司（以下简称为“尊湃通讯”）等申请诉前财产保全一审非诉保全审查裁定书。据裁定书显示，上海海思技术有限公司申请冻结尊湃通讯银行存款人民币9500万元，或查封、冻结、扣押价值相应的其他财产。上海市知识产权法院审查认为，上述申请符合法律规定可予准许。\n尊湃通讯\n尊湃通讯成立于2021年3月，总部位于南京，全球研发中心在上海张江。同年5月，其完成由高榕资本领投，江北佳康科技跟投的近亿人民币天使轮融资。\n尊湃通讯创始团队成员来自（华为）海思、高通、Marvell、展锐等芯片大厂，核心团队成员毕业于国内外著名高校，其中90%以上拥有博士或硕士学位。主要提供家庭及企业高性能、全生态智慧场景芯片组及解决方案，技术覆盖Wi-Fi 6路由器芯片及完整解决方案。\n2022年5月，尊湃通讯宣布超募完成数亿人民币Pre-A轮融资，由小米集团、湖杉资本、天际资本、嘉御资本、上海科创旗下海望资本、平治信息等知名财务投资机构以及产业投资方组成。\n此事一经发酵，作为尊湃投资人之一的小米很快被卷入一些谣言之中。对此，小米集团官博在2023年12月24日发声明澄清。\n有关案件更多细节被曝光\n公开资料显示，张琨（美国籍）为尊湃通讯科技（南京）有限公司法定代表人、董事长兼总经理，曾任美国高通射频工程师，在华为海思芯片公司任技术总监十年。离开华为创立尊湃通讯前，张琨是华为海思21级技术总监 —— 这是华为内部技术人员中非常高的级别，掌握着华为Wi-Fi 6射频芯片的关键信息。近期有爆料人向透露了更多细节，“张琨在职期间就已经开始拉拢团队了”，形成了一个Wi-Fi芯片核心高管团队，再由这些人对原华为产品端到端人员整编制挖角，涉及芯片的射频、SoC、数字、算法、解决方案、封装等各个环节，员工共近百人。\n2021年2月，张琨从华为离职，第二个月就创立了尊湃通讯，“尊湃创业第一年海思前员工占比高达60%”。据透露，这些海思前员工并非一次性加入尊湃，他们分批离职，甚至多人在职华为期间，周末到尊湃工作。公开资料显示，截至2022年，该公司拥有9项专利、3项著作权及18条商标信息。彼时，公司刚刚成立一年多。\n直到东窗事发，外界才知道这匹芯片黑马背后的研发实际上是靠盗取华为海思的芯片技术。上述爆料人称，曾有20多位原华为员工离职前大量访问非本职工作文档，通过抄写、拍照、截图等方式窃取芯片电路图、版图、规格参数，后通过公司内部通讯工具将上述部分技术信息层层转发到公司外部，用于入职尊湃公司后使用。2022年11月，尊湃先通过窃取信息做出第一版芯片后，然后改头换面修改成第二版，再把第一版删除掉，以逃避法律责任。\n就在东窗事发前，张琨已经有所察觉，2022年11月，他曾紧急前往代理律师事务所商讨应对计划，统一更换了新手机，并组织人对尊湃的服务器、公司邮箱、个人办公桌面云、个人办公电脑等进行了清理与转移，删除证据。就在所谓研发过程中，张琨还试图通过反向工程规避侵权风险，但至被抓捕时，仍未拿到反向工程结果。",

    "text": "A 4-year-old Torrance boy who went missing for nearly 24 hours near Huntington Lake in Fresno County was found by rescue crews tired and hungry, but otherwise unharmed Friday morning, June 21, authorities said. The parents of Christian Ramirez had been staying at the Rancheria Campground when they called the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office at 11 a.m. Thursday to report their son missing, Fresno County sheriff’s officials said. ABC Los Angeles reported the boy and his family are from Torrance. The parents had searched for the boy for about an hour before calling authorities, prompting a response that included a search and rescue team, an air support unit, Forest Service rangers and California Fish & Wildlife officers to search near the northeastern corner Huntington Lake, in the Sierra National Forest and about 65 miles northeast of Fresno, officials said. “In a matter of less than five minutes, he just disappeared,” Fresno County Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Pursell told ABC 30, a Fresno station . The boy was found by a Tulare County Search and Rescue team about 8 a.m. Friday nestled under a tree about a quarter-mile away from where he was last seen, officials said. The boy was given a sandwich and carried out to be reunited with his parents. Searchers called out for the boy in the morning and he called back, Pursell told the station. “This was an amazing show of teamwork and dedication,” the Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. “There were more than 50 deputies and volunteers who combined to participate in this search.” Members of the community also offered to help in the search, officials said. Video posted by the Sheriff’s Office showed a man carrying the boy, draped in a black jacket and snacking on the sandwich, along a trail out to awaiting vehicles and later to his awaiting parents. Pursell told reporters that the area is known for having bears, snakes, waterways and “slip and fall” hazards and that it was fortunate Christian was found unharmed. “There’s a lot of things that could have gone really, really wrong with this one,” he told reporters. “We got lucky, the family got lucky.” City News Service contributed to this report.",

    "title": "#30 Sánchez celebra la salida de Vox de gobiernos autonómicos: \"Es un gran día para España\"",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nAl final el gobierno frankenstein, el que iba a reventar por un lado u otro, ahí sigue. Y mientras el PP teniendo que lidiar con una panda de paletos vociferantes como aliados, y ahora además con una escisión aún más paleta y aún más vociferante.\n[#1](c1#c-1) son unos sinvergüenzas. Ellos y los que los apoyan. Mucho marketing, pero ahí seguimos apoyando el belicismo OTAN.\nNi las autonómicas ni las europeas contaron con mi voto.\nSi se piensan que se van a mantener con el \"que vienen los fachas\" y seguir apoyando los genocidios de ucrania y palestina van de puto culo.\nPues voy a hacer de abogado del diablo. Lo primero de todo es que avisaron de salirse de los gobiernos si se cumplía lo del reparto de menores...y han cumplido. Seguramente si hubieran reculado ya estaríamos con el mantra de los sillones y las poltronas.\nSe está celebrando el reparto, cuando seguimos sin atajar el problema. Muchos de ellos no son menores, no tenemos información alguna suya previa y por mucho que digamos donde deberían estar es con sus familias.\nSupongo que desde la perspectiva de la \"izquierda\" esto es una fiesta. Pero no todo el mundo piensa igual y esto es un problema que ni los políticos de izquierda o derecha se van a comer en sus barrios y casas.\nLuego vendrán los sesudos análisis del auge de la ultra derecha.\nY bueno, ahora ya podéis tildarme de fascista o lo que os salga de las pelotas por no seguir el ideario estándar de la izquierda.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Es el asunto del tonto, el dedo y la luna. Pero ya sabemos que eso en la izquierda no ocurre. Somos moralmente superiores.\n[#6](c6#c-6) los menores (y mayores) van a seguir viniendo a España le guste a quien le guste. Salvo que pongas a la armada a disparar a los cayucos como proponen estos neandertales.\nPuedes hacer dos cosas:\n1) ayudar a África para que no vengan\n2) aprovechar que vienen y darles una educación y una salida laboral\nA mí me vale cualquiera de las dos. Lo que me parece inaceptable y estúpido es usar la inmigración como un arma electoral.\n[#6](c6#c-6) El problema es el mismo de siempre. Si omites las guerras que provocamos, la inmigración estaría en mismas cifras que en 2018.\nEl problema, de ser ese y no la natalidad, pero no voy a entrar en eso. Ese supuesto problema no se ataja con antorchas en casas de acogida de niños, ni despotricando, ni siquiera ahogando los con balas de goma cuando cruzan la frontera nadando.\nSe arregla con política, relaciones con marruecos y negociación. Es la única forma. No con pirados con antorchas.\nUna vez se cruza la frontera, si no sabes a donde deportarlos, debes cumplir con los derechos humanos y respetar la dignidad de las personas.\nPq no te olvides que aunque musulmanes y negros, son seres humanos cuyo delito principal es querer buscarse la vida.\n[#6](c6#c-6) Un poco historia te hará más ilustrado. Las migraciones son milenarias, y lo seguirán siendo y eso no lo va a parar ningún gobierno te guste o no, porque quién no tiene nada, le da igual perder lo poco que tiene. Y otra cosa. Europa necesita 50 mill. de migrantes si quiere seguir siendo algo en el mundo,y África tiene casi la mitad de su población con menos de 40 años. Les necesitamos nos guste o no.\nTeniendo en cuenta el contexto, que vox es un partido de gente que ha demostrado tener poca capacidad de gestionar, que es un partido para hacer ruido en la oposición más que para gobernar (igual que podemos en este punto), y que esta crisis de los menores no es ni de lejos representativo del problema inmigratorio.\nPero hay que reconocer que esto es un gesto de honestidad que no recordamos en la política española. Renunciar a poltronas porque se han incumplido puntos que eran importantes para ellos desde el punto de vista de programa. Sobre cualquier otro partido (desde el PP a indepes o el psoe) hay cientos de ejemplos de lo contrario, de aferrarse al sillón y capear las preguntas con una desvergüenza acojonante.\n[#10](c10#c-10)\nLa intolerancia no es algo positivo.\nCuando tu negocias un gobierno y más si eres una minoría estás obligado a aceptar cosas que no vienen en tu programa. Se llama negociar.\nTodo por repartirse 300-400 niños entre 44 millones de españoles, niños que ya están en España (sí, Canarias, señor Abascal, es España y hay que ser solidaria con ella, que también hay españoles allí) y cosa que lleva haciéndose cada año. Ultra\"católicos\" negando el auxilio a niños. VAYA VAYA.\nEs que no dan para más. Ni honor ni pollas, es que son tontos. El \"honor\" es para las batallas, no para la política.\nMe arremango el fajín y apurandome el Cinzano promulgo:\n-Hay un movimiento divertido en la derecha, al crecer Vox, el PP se vio obligado a endurecer sus posturas mas escoradas para intentar recuperar los votos del ala mas reaccionaria que se iban desangrando pa Vox, eso es lo que vimos estos años, un \"a ver quien dice la idiotez mas gorda\". Esta semana asistimos a una nueva dinámica encabezada por el follaardillas, Vox ha visto como le crece un enano por la derecha, no puede permitirlo, o sea q se enfurruñan y se cierran en banda haciendo bandera de... pos algo tan propagandistico y de impacto entre el electorado mas ultra como los MENAS... (Aunque sea algo tan anecdótico como 21 personas, muchos niños, pa acoger en una comunidad como Castilla.... q lo pones en perspectiva y dices q cojones 21 personas no tienes donde meterlas en la españa vacia???? Esto no es \"problema\" esto es publicidad pa sus cafeteros) Con lo que puede ojo puede, que el PP vuelva a intentar pegar un giro hacia el centro (con el debilitamiento del ala dura del partido, Ayuso juapa, te miro a ti q ultimamente estas muy callada) y dejar que Vox y Alvise se maten a garrotazos a ver quien es mas y muy Ejpañó\nGolpe en la barra erupto, niño ponte una tapita aqui anda, que hay que darle culto al cuerpo\nlas que más te afectan.\nEntre muchas otras, presupuestos y reforma laboral a pesar de los sobornos a sallas y adanero y el golpe de estado del por entonces TC pepesuno.\nPara no aprobar leyes... Recuerdas cuánto estuvo Rajoy sin presupuestos? Gracias a eso el hundimiento de España se relajo esos últimos años de gobierno de la trotona, que no pudo robar todo lo que quiso como había hecho con la sareb.\nEra para\n#_13 que tiene estrabismo intelectual y los dos ojos le miran para el mismo lado.",
