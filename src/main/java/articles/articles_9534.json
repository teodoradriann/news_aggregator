    "text": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces By Press Association December 29 2023, 12.10am Share Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces Share via Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Messenger Linkedin Email Post link https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/news/uk/6310613/sharp-rise-in-religious-hate-crimes-recorded-by-uks-largest-police-forces/ Copy Link The Home Office condemned the rise, saying there was ‘no place for hate in our society’ (PA)\nThe number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

Picture: iStock Gauteng residents have been warned to brace for a heatwave across several parts of the province. The South African Weather Service (Saws) said extremely hot temperatures are expected in several provinces during the weekend. “Heatwave with persistently high temperatures is expected over Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Free State, except the western and southern parts, and the eastern parts of the North West from Saturday (2 November 2024) until Monday.” ALSO READ: Hot weather tomorrow: Temperatures well into 30s before weekend heatwave The mercury is expected to hit the high thirties in some areas. Temperatures in Johannesburg are forecast to start off at a minimum of 17°C becoming very hot and reaching a high of 35°C on Sunday. Pretoria is also expected to be hot with scorching temperatures starting with a minimum of 20°C becoming very hot and reaching a high of 38°C on Sunday. Saws also warned of extremely high fire danger conditions expected over the central and eastern parts of the Northern Cape, western parts of both Free State and North West, as well as Inxuba Yethemba Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape. Meanwhile, Johannesburg Emergency Services (EMS) has taken note of the heatwave conditions. Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi has urged residents to take precautions. “Extremely hot temperatures expected in most parts of the City of Johannesburg over this weekend. Residents are urged to stay hydrated, drink lots of water and stay away from direct sunlight between 11am and 3pm in the afternoon. “Those who are working directly in the sunlight are urged to take regular breaks and the elderly who are on medication to stay in cool areas because exposure to this extremely hot temperatures can lead to heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke,“ Mulaudzi said. Mulaudzi said they will remain on high alert for any eventuality during the scorching weather conditions. “When the temperatures are extremely high, humans’ ability to cool their bodies through sweating is reduced. “This can be a real threat that leads to hyperthermia. In an extremely hot environment, the most serious health and safety concern is heat stroke. Heat stroke can be fatal if medical attention is not available immediately.” ALSO READ: Natural disasters set to increase by 37% globally by 2025 – Report For those who will be tempted to swim to cool off the heat, here are some of the safety tips “Stay safe around water during this period of heat wave, for any life-threatening emergencies immediately call our Emergency Services Call Centre on 011 375 5911,” Mulaudzi said.

NOTA Tras el diálogo público entre autoridades de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras (UNAH) y la Secretaría de Salud, respecto de las denuncias que los estudiantes en su práctica profesional del área de la salud hicieran de los tratos que reciben en el Hospital Escuela; ambas instituciones acordaron elaborar un plan de trabajo a corto plazo, así como designar personal para darle cumplimiento y seguimiento del presente acuerdo, mismo que deberá ejecutarse de manera inmediata. De parte de la Secretaría de Salud, se acordó que deberá cumplir con 20 puntos que abarcan medidas desde la dotación de espacios físicos para que los practicantes de la UNAH puedan desarrollar sus actividades académicas y de atención a la población, además de un espacio digno para descanso; por otra parte tendrá que hacer cambios en las jefaturas médicas; garantizar una distribución proporcional de plazas de servicio social; y respetar los horarios específicos para el desarrollo de clases y actividades académicas del estudiantado. La SESAL proveerá según su capacidad presupuestaria, de los recursos tecnológicos, quirófanos e insumos para las actividades prácticas del estudiantado de grado y posgrado de la UNAH en igualdad de condiciones, así como el suministro del equipo que garantice sus medidas de bioseguridad. En el caso del estudiantado de UNAH-VS, la SESAL deberá garantizar cupos en el Bloque I y Bloque II en Hospital Mario Catarino Rivas. Entre tanto, se solventarán los pagos pendientes a los estudiantes residentes, así como a los estudiantes que brindan su servicio social. Garantizar que ningún estudiante de la UNAH será objeto de represalia por parte de autoridades y asistenciales dependientes de la SESAL y que tengan relación directa o indirecta con estudiantes. Por su parte, la UNAH se compromete abrir más cupos a nivel de grado y posgrado para la cobertura necesaria de atención en hospitales y centros de salud del interior del país. Garantizar la transparencia en el manejo de asignación de becas a los internados y los posgrados, con la participación y veeduría de la SESAL. Los estudiantes deberán comprometerse con la sostenibilidad del sistema sanitario, capaces de abordar los desafíos actuales y futuros de manera efectiva y responsable. El plan de trabajo acordado por las partes lo integraran los decanos de las facultades de Ciencias, Ciencias Médicas, Ciencias Químicas y Farmacia, Odontología; y por la SESAL el director del Hospital Escuela Herbert López y los directores del Desarrollo del Recurso Humano y de las Redes Integrales de Servicio Social.",
