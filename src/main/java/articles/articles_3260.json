    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nPues mira que me jode que tenga razón...\nHacer que los caseros hagan de servicios sociales en caso de problemas económicos del inquilino no es nunca una buena opción...\nPorque todo el mundo sabe que si un casero pudiera echar a alguien al primer impago eso les llenaría de tanta felicidad y alegría que pondrían los alquileres más baratos.\nEl problema de la vivienda es que interesa construir poco para subir el precio.\nEste es un populista que mejor darle de comer a parte. En general si es un claro asunto de allanamiento de morada, se les echa muy rápidamente. Es el caso cuando se meten en una primera o segunda residencia (o tercera!). Pero hay casos que no queda muy claro y debería actuarse con mayor rapidez, especialmente cuando hablamos de pequeños propietarios que alquilan un piso o un apartamento. Hay que dar más seguridad.\nEs que las cosas no se resuelven con magia, o rezando. Se resuelven actuando, y en este caso, con política.\nLa misma política que permitió que todo el mundo tenga derecho a vacaciones, limitar la jornada laboral a 40h semanales, asegurar la atención médica y el acceso a la educación para todos, ....\nLo que nunca va a pasar es que desregularizando todo y dejando que la iniciativa privada haga lo que le dé la gana, vayan a mejorar las condiciones de los trabajdores, o a aser un mundo más justo. Y para ejemplo, el dúo Trump-Musk, que venderían a sus hijos si le ofreciesen un buen dinero.",

    "text": "The Dayton region could see its first significant winter storm of the new year Sunday, with heavy snowfall possible.The National Weather Service in Wilmington is urging people to stay weather aware throughout the weekend, as snow is likely starting Sunday afternoon and continuing into Monday morning.While it’s too early for total snow estimates, John Franks, a meteorologist for NWS, said the region could see between 4.5 inches in the southwest area into Cincinnati and 1.5 inches at the Dayton International Airport during the day Sunday. Communities north of Interstate 70 could see less snow, between ¾ an inch to ½ an inch.Franks described Dayton and southwest Montgomery County as being in the pivot area, where storms heading up from the southwest could turn and start to head southeast. This could result in a large discrepancy in snow totals.Though the weather could change leading up to Sunday, he said it isn’t out of the question the region could see a significant snowfall. Total snowfall in the Dayton area could be 1.5 to double the amount forecasted for Sunday day.A Winter Storm Watch has been issued for most of our counties for the Sunday/Monday system. There is increasing confidence that a swath of significant snow totals is expected, along with a wintry-mix that could result in ice accums near/south of the OH River. Stay tuned for more! pic.twitter.com/Ppi9aT1fVs Franks also said the storm could shift south or north, which would result in less or more snow respectively.A Winter Storm Watch is scheduled from 7 a.m. Sunday to midnight Tuesday.The NWS forecast said it appears likely parts of southern Ohio and southeast Indiana could get more than 6 inches of snow. Models start to decrease north of the I-70 corridor.Depending on the severity of the storm, it could match or beat record high snowfalls in Dayton. In 1903, Dayton received a record high of 2.7 inches of snow for Jan. 5, and a high of 4.8 inches on Jan. 6, 1910.While this is early in the season for a significant winter storm, Dayton has seen large snowfalls in January.With the expectation for a major winter storm to impact the region Sunday into Monday, now is the time to make preparations for your home and vehicles! Be sure to stay updated with the latest info from reputable sources as we progress through the next several days! pic.twitter.com/L1Yx7ROzar The record high snowfall is 6 inches or more for 10 days in January, including 9.8 inches on Jan. 1, 10 inches on Jan. 11 and 12.2 inches on Jan. 26, according to the NWS.Snow is expected to move out of the region during the day Monday, but it will be followed by bitterly cold temperatures. Highs are expected to stay in the teens for the second half of next week.The NWS encouraged people to start planning ahead for winter weather and make sure homes are stocked with any necessary supplies and are prepared for power outages. People should also make sure their vehicles have a safety kit and cold weather gear.",

    "text": "RADICAL love God is visible in every trace of His creation and although the com-mon folk, the blind and dumb animal like creatures don’t recognize Him, the mystics drink not a single drop of water without discovering His vision. Love within the Is-lamic context is nothing except the very being of God, a cosmic current of love and mercy, that unleashes itself out of divine, creates this realm of existence and causes every one of us to come into being. It is an ocean that is God, is from God and flow-ing back to God. “Allah is He who flows between the pericardium and the heart, just as the tears flow from the eyelids,” says Mansur Al Hallaj. One of the names of Allah is Al Wadood the loving and Fakar-ud-din Iraqi says, “Ishq is the very being of Allah. If you can love the fellow human beings purely, not through your ego, with no mo-tives, you can merge with the divine current, and then the same love will carry you back home.”” Our love of humanity is inseparable from the love of God,” says Ah-med Al-Ghazali.\nFakar-ud- din al Razi says, “All of Islam can be reduced to two words, “Devotion to the Creator and service to His creation.” Quran says, “God is the first without begin-ning, the last without end,” outwardly manifest in the diversity of his attributes, but inwardly hidden in the essence of His Oneness.\nUntil five centuries after demise of Holy Prophet, Islamic Sufism was based on the idea of fearing God. Al–Ghazali was so much afraid of God that it led him to the point of paralysis. Rumi tells us that God humanity relationship is that of Lover and Be-loved, we can achieve union with the Beloved that there is path to God and that path is radical love, extreme love, that will come and burn inside of you everything other than God.” He says,” One look, one glance and you will fall in love with that Infinite beauty and what is the solution another glance, another look and you burn more.”\nAttar says, “A thousand for His love expired each day and those who saw his face in blank dismay would rave and grieve and mourn their lives away. To die for the love of that bewitching sight was worth a hundred lives. Without His light, none could sur-vive His absence, nor could endure the King’s proximity. How strange it was that man could survive neither by the presence nor the absence of His look.” Rumi says, “Last night I became love crazed; Love saw me and said, “I am here. Don’t shout, say noth-ing.” “Love I am afraid of something else.” Love said, “There is nothing else, say nothing.\nI will whisper great secrets in your ears, just nod yes, say nothing.” “What a beauty are You, an angel or human.” “Love said, not an angel, not a human say nothing.” I said, “I will lose my mind if you don’t tell me. Love said, “Then lose your mind and stay that way, say nothing.” I said, “My heart isn’t what you are describing God.” Love said, “Yes my child, but hush, say nothing.”\nIn Masanwi Rumi says, “O God, I have discovered love, how marvellous, how good, how beautiful it is…. I offer my salutations to the stars and moon. I offer my saluta-tions to the spirit of passion that aroused and excited this universe.” At another point, Rumi addresses it so beautifully as You. “Should everything pass away, it couldn’t happen without You. This heart of mine bears Your imprint. It has nowhere else to turn. The eye of intellect is drunk with You. The wheeling galaxy is humble before You.\nYou, my grape wine and my intoxication, my rose garden and my springtime, My sleep and repose, nothing happens without you.” You have disturbed my sleep. You have effaced my personality. You have broken every attachment. Nothing happens without you.” Rumi narrates the story of Lalih Majnun. The King heard about the be-witching beauty of Lalih and desired to see her, who is this, who made Majnun mad and he sings such heart rendering songs in praise of her. He called all the girls of that town and thought she would stand out amongst them, but all he could see was ordi-nary village girls. He then says, “Who is Lalih and Lalih steps forward and says, “I am Lalih, but you are not Majnun.” Rumi says in order to see the beauty of Lalih, you have to learn to look through the eyes of Majnun.\nAhmed Ghazali says, “Your eyes have to born again, you have to learn to look through the glance of love, you have to learn to speak the words of love, your feet have to walk the path of love and that is a complete transformation of faculties.” Open any page/Surah of Quran, you see the names of God, loving, compassionate forgiving, caring, generous, just, truthful, protector, kind, merciful and so on. The qualities that God wants us to develop and the qualities, which Quran describes God are synony-mous. If we want a connection with the Infinite and want His light to show us the way in this world and hereafter we have to grow in these qualities.",

The authorities have carried out 4,500 rescues, but until now there is still an undetermined number of missing people and the emergency continues.\nAccording to data from the current deployment of the Civil Guard, more than 2,466 officials have been deployed distributed across the different emergency services. Thousands of volunteers have also arrived in the affected areas, but government representatives have asked them to leave due to the collapse of access roads.\nThe president of the Valencian Community, Carlos Mazón, said that they will do everything necessary to prevent citizens from hindering the work of the emergency services.\nThe latest count provided by the Generalitat Valenciana Emergencies – Valencian regional government – ​​estimates that in the last hours the number of fatalities may increase.\nSeveral people walk among the vehicles stacked on the train tracks in Alfafar (Valencia) | EFE/ Kai Försterling One of the most affected towns in the province was Paiporta, just 10 kilometers from the Valencian capital, where the mortal remains of about 45 people were recovered. In other municipalities, such as La Torre and Castellar, 13 were counted.\nMeanwhile, in the region of Castilla-La Mancha there are two deaths, although there are an undetermined number of missing people, in addition to significant damage.\nIn Andalusia, the victim is a British man who lived in Malaga and died shortly after arriving at the hospital, but the floods also affected an unknown number of people.\nIn fact, more than a thousand were rescued in different parts of the region.\nEFE/Manuel Bruque\nDue to these events, the Spanish government decreed three days of mourning for the people who died. The measure will begin on October 31 until November 2.\nRelatives of the missing ask for help Relatives of the missing people in the municipalities most affected by the storm express their despair because they have no news about them and ask the authorities for help to locate them.\n“The last time I spoke to my son was last night, he told me that the water reached his waist and he has not answered me again,” said a woman in an interview with the EFE news agency. He indicated that his son is Colombian and was working in Benetússer.\nEFE/Biel Aliño\nThe father of another of the missing said that he has tried to contact his son, who at the time of the heavy rains was in Alfafar, where another of his daughters and his two grandchildren also live.\n“I am trying to call him but there is no communication with him, and it is not possible either with the Police or with the Alfafar City Council,” he assured.\nThe kings of Spain will visit the most affected areas The kings of Spain will travel this weekend to the areas most affected by DANA, and to do so they will contact the mayors of the municipalities that have suffered the most damage to organize their visit, Zarzuela sources have reported.\nHis visit will be carried out in such a way that the work being carried out by the emergency services, the local police, the State Security Forces and also the Armed Forces and social organizations is not interfered with, according to sources.\nFurthermore, Zarzuela has confirmed that tonight a first group of 50 members of the Royal Guard will leave for the affected areas to provide help, following instructions from the head of state, to whom another 50 colleagues will join tomorrow.\nThe most serious floods in the last 75 years in Spain The floods caused by torrential rains between October 29 and 30 in the Spanish regions of the Valencian Community and Castilla-La Mancha and which have caused dozens of deaths are the greatest tragedy caused by rains so far this century and are counted among the most serious in the last 75 years.\nTo find a disaster of similar proportions in the Valencian Community we have to go back to 1982, when the overflowing of the Júcar river in Valencia and the failure of the Tous dam, in the east of the country, caused 38 deaths and the evacuation of 100 thousand people.\nEFE/Miguel Ángel Polo The worst in history in Spain\nWhat is considered the largest hydrological catastrophe in Spain occurred on the night of September 25 to 26, 1962 in the Catalan region of Vallès Occidental, in the northeast, on which more than 200 liters per square meter fell in three hours. that caused a thousand fatalities.\nThis is the chronological list of the greatest tragedies caused by rains in Spain in the last 75 years:\n-October 13, 1957: More than 80 people died when the Turia River overflowed as it passed through Valencia and 1,700 homes were destroyed. The flood determined the urban future of the city, which planned a new channel for the river with the aim of avoiding similar disasters.\n-January 9, 1959: The overflow of the Vega de Tera dam flooded and devastated the Zamoran town of Ribadelago (center of the country) and caused the death of 144 of its 532 inhabitants.\n-On the night of September 25 to 26, 1962, more than 200 liters per square meter fell in three hours in the Catalan region of Vallès Occidental, causing around 400 deaths, according to official figures of the time, although it is currently estimated that There were at least a thousand fatalities, half of them in Terrassa and Rubí, in the province of Barcelona.

    "text": "All the New York Jets wanted in 2023 was one healthy and productive quarterback. Looking back, they might wish they had answered when Joe Flacco knocked in September.\nFlacco instead played catch with his brother an hour away from the Jets’ facility and waited three more months for the Cleveland Browns to call.\nAnd did he ever answer.\nFlacco has the Browns (10-5) on the doorstep of an improbable playoff bid and gets a visit from his old team, the Jets (6-9), on Thursday night with a chance to hand-deliver a reminder of what might have been for the beleaguered New York franchise.\nBeat the Jets, and the Browns can clinch a spot in the playoffs.\n“We talked about it a little bit this past week. Every week you look at the game and you’re like, ‘Man, it’s a big win. Another big one,'” Flacco said.\nQUICK PICK\nJourneyman Trevor Siemian is the Jets’ fourth starting quarterback of the year and his experience is very valuable, especially behind an inconsistent offensive line. However, that will be put to the ultimate test on the road, on a short week and against Cleveland’s top-ranked defense with the Browns trying to clinch a playoff spot.\nPrediction: Browns 23, Jets 13\nTRENDING\nThe Browns are consensus 7.5-point favorites. That includes at BetMGM, where the line moved from opening at 7.0 with Cleveland backed by 73 percent of the bets and 67 percent of the money.\nThe Browns’ moneyline has also been popular, with it shifting from -300 to -350 while drawing 78 percent of the money. However, the Jets have been backed by 52 percent of the total bets at +280.\nThe Over/Under has been split with the point total settling at 34.5 by Thursday. The Over has drawn 57 percent of the bets and 51 percent of the money at the book.\nPROP PICK\nBrowns TE David Njoku Anytime TD (+185 at DraftKings): Njoku has found quick chemistry with Flacco, catching 22 passes for 239 yards and four touchdowns over the past three games. He’s also averaging 10.3 targets over that span. Njoku has been a popular player in the prop market at both books, but you’ll get a slightly better payout at DraftKings than the same prop at +160 at BetMGM.\nTHE NEWS\nThe fourth quarterback to start for the Browns this season, Flacco took over in Week 13. Since then, he leads the NFL with 1,307 yards and 10 touchdowns. The Jets have 10 total TD passes in 2023.\nWhen New York and 30 other teams passed, Flacco said he fell right into the ideal spot with the Browns.\n“You think you are coming into a good situation,” Flacco said of signing with the Browns. “There’s a possibility for this. I think you assume from the outside this is a pretty good situation. When you get here it’s an even better situation than you’ve imagined.”\nThe Jets expected to be in this position but with another heavily seasoned quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, at the controls. Without Rodgers, a championship-caliber defense wasn’t enough to consistently generate wins using Zach Wilson, Tim Boyle and Siemian at quarterback.\nRunning back Breece Hall is proving to be a lifeline for the Jets’ offense with 39 receptions in the past six games. Hall had 191 yards from scrimmage (95 rushing, 96 receiving) in last week’s win against the Commanders.\nThe Browns’ defense has allowed fewer than 300 yards in five of its past six games. Cleveland is first against the pass (160.1 yards per game), total defense (260.3 yards per game), yards per play (4.46 yards) and interception rate (3.46 percent).\n“I think the fans are going to bring the energy, I think we’re going to bring the energy,” Browns guard Joel Bitonio said.\nKEY STAT\nDefensive end Myles Garrett has 13 of the Browns’ 44 sacks in 2023.\nINJURY REPORT\nWilson will not play because of a concussion. Siemian is expected to get his second consecutive start after throwing for 217 yards and a touchdown during Sunday’s 30-28 victory over Washington.\nThe Jets will also be without offensive tackle Duane Brown (back) and tight end Jeremy Ruckert, while running back Israel Abanikanda (ankle), wide receiver Allen Lazard (illness) and kicker Greg Zuerlein (right quadriceps) are questionable.\nThe Browns have lost multiple quarterbacks to season-ending injuries. Deshaun Watson (shoulder) and rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson (hip) are on injured reserve along with running back Nick Chubb (knee) and both of the Browns’ starting offensive tackles.\nAlso out for Cleveland are defensive end Ogbo Okoronkwo (pectoral) and linebacker Anthony Walker (knee). Punter Corey Bojorquez (left quad) is doubtful, while wide receivers Amari Cooper (heel) and Marquise Goodwin (knee) and free safety Juan Thornhill (calf) are questionable.\nTHEY SAID IT\nJets head coach Robert Saleh, who interviewed to be Cleveland’s head coach in 2020 and coached Flacco in New York, isn’t surprised by Flacco steering the Browns into the playoff picture.\n“I’ve said it before, he’s like a Ford pickup truck. You might not like it in the summer but in the winter months that son of a gun starts humming,” Saleh said.\n–Field Level Media",

    "text": "Germany has handed over a Skynex air defense system to Ukraine in its latest tranche of military aid to bolster the country's air defense. The platform is the latest of an 182-million euro ($192 million) deal in 2022 between Germany and Rheinmetall to equip Ukraine with the anti-missile capability. The integrated tracking unit will be used to counter air targets from Russian forces, performing short-range searches, classification, and identification of threatening aircraft and missiles in Kyiv's airspace. The latest package also includes ammunition for the air defense system, as well as 10 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, medium-range missiles, a surveillance radar, and tank transporter tractors. Since 2022, Germany has provided around 5.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in supplies to Kyiv. Additional assistance from Berlin includes military training for 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers and treatment and rehabilitation of injured troops. Skynex at a Glance Rheinmetall's Skynex system is a short-range air defense capability with a modular design to help customize its sensors and effectors to fit various mission requirements. Each Skynex system is composed of four Revolver Gun Mk3 cannons, a CN-1 control node, and an X-TAR3D radar. Its operators include Romania and Austria, both of which use the platform as their premier capability for airspace monitoring.",
