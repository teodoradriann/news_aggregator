    "text": "Better late than never, the Biden administration last week issued a proclamation “granting a full, unconditional, and categorical pardon of additional federal and D.C. offenses of simple possession, attempted possession, and use of marijuana.”\nThe “additional” bit is because this is an extension of a pardon of just over a year ago for possession, adding in the attempted possession and use categories.\nIt’s the thought that counts, sure, sort of — obviously there is a relatively limited universe of cannabis arrests for small amounts that were federal in nature, or for offenses in the District of Columbia, as opposed to in the 50 states, under the laws of which most of the millions of Americans who were arrested for offenses related to weed over the last century-plus got needlessly tangled in the legal system — many hundreds of thousands with their lives in great part ruined by the absurd, counterproductive prohibition.\nClearly, this is an (almost) election-year gambit by President Joe Biden in order to garner votes.\nBecause the fact is that, for a liberal Democrat, Biden throughout his long political career has had a most illiberal stance on decriminalizing marijuana.\nFor instance, in December 2010, as Mother Jones reports, “then-Vice President Biden told ABC News that he thinks cannabis is a ‘gateway drug’— a theory for which the evidence is shaky at best — and that ‘legalization is a mistake.’”\nThen, in 2014, he told Time magazine he still didn’t support legalization — although he did at least add that he thought “focusing significant resources” on convicting people for smoking marijuana was a “waste.”\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, then-Sen. Joe Biden was a key part of a group of lawmakers who wrote and then passed “tough-on-crime” legislation that included the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act and the 1994 crime bill, both of which continued and added to the federal laws that lumped in marijuana with opiates and other drugs and increased the criminal penalties for mere possession as well as for distribution.\nHundreds of thousands of Americans, especially the poor and the non-White, were thus rounded up and arrested, with many serving long prison sentences.\nSo Biden is just barely catching up now with Americans’ attitudes toward marijuana prohibition. Polls show that well over 60% of Americans say the use of marijuana should be legalized, and in 2018 one poll showed that included 45% of Republicans.\nWith his proclamation last week, Biden also commuted the federal prison sentences of 11 people serving hard time for non-violent drug offenses, and pardoned thousands of others for cannabis use or simple possession.\n“Criminal records for marijuana use and possession have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,” Biden said in a statement. “Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs.”\nNow Biden needs to get on board with the movement within his administration to finally declassify marijuana from its current listing as a Schedule 1 drug along with many so-called “harder” and certainly potentially more dangerous drugs, including an Aug. 29 recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services that the drug be reclassified as a Schedule 3 controlled substance.\nThat recommendation is the first stance by the federal government that acknowledges marijuana has medicinal value.\nIt would also take cannabis growers out of Section 280E of the IRS code, which prohibits marijuana businesses from taking normal business deductions on federal tax returns.\nBut, so far at least, the recommendation would still mandate that federal pot laws require a physician’s prescription for cannabis, which California and other states have long dispensed with.\nElection gambit or not, the move this month toward decriminalization is a positive step toward reform of regressive marijuana laws.",

    "title": "Papa Francisco, noche tranquila: \"La crisis ha terminado, las transfusiones ya no son necesarias\"",
    "text": "La salud del Papa Francisco sigue siendo delicada, tras haber sufrido una crisis respiratoria asmática prolongada en las últimas horas. Aunque el Vaticano ha informado de una mejoría relativa, los médicos del Hospital Gemelli de Roma han señalado que su estado sigue siendo crítico y que “el Papa no está fuera de peligro”.\nEl Pontífice, de 88 años, continúa recibiendo oxígeno de alto flujo mediante almohadillas nasales para ayudarle en la respiración. Además, los últimos análisis revelaron trombocitopenia asociada a anemia, lo que obligó a administrarle transfusiones de sangre.\nPronóstico reservado y nuevas pruebas médicas\nEsta mañana, el Papa se ha sometido a nuevas pruebas clínicas, cuyos resultados serán clave para definir su evolución. A pesar de haber pasado una noche tranquila, el Vaticano mantiene el pronóstico reservado y alerta sobre la gravedad del cuadro clínico.\nEl virólogo Fabrizio Pregliasco, en declaraciones a Adnkronos Salute, explicó que la combinación de neumonía bilateral y bronquitis asmática crónica está complicando su recuperación:\n“El cuadro clínico del Papa es preocupante, no solo por la neumonía, sino por los problemas respiratorios preexistentes que no están ayudando a mejorar su estado. La crisis respiratoria y la trombocitopenia no son señales de estabilización, por lo que su pronóstico sigue siendo reservado.”\nOraciones en el Vaticano y en Italia por la salud del Papa\nLa gravedad de la situación ha movilizado a la Iglesia y a los fieles. Esta tarde, a las 17:30 horas, se celebrará una misa en la Basílica de San Juan de Letrán para pedir por la salud del Papa. En un mensaje dirigido a los católicos de Roma, el cardenal vicario Baldo Reina pidió orar por Francisco:\n“Elevemos nuestra oración al Señor para que lo sostenga con su gracia y le dé la fuerza necesaria para superar este momento de prueba.”\nAdemás, la Conferencia Episcopal Italiana (CEI) ha convocado encuentros de oración en todo el país. El cardenal Matteo Zuppi, arzobispo de Bolonia, presidirá un rosario especial en la iglesia de San Domenico, transmitido en vivo por Tv2000.\n“Queremos unirnos al Santo Padre en este momento de sufrimiento, para que encuentre alivio y se recupere lo antes posible.”\nEl Papa Francisco sigue activo pese a su estado de salud\nA pesar de las dificultades, el Papa continúa con algunas actividades dentro de lo posible. Según el último boletín vaticano, Francisco ha pasado el día sentado en un sillón, aunque con más dolores que en jornadas anteriores. Además, ha mantenido su rutina de lectura, firma de documentos y comunicación con sus colaboradores cercanos.\nDurante la celebración de la Misa Jubilar de los Diáconos, el arzobispo Rino Fisichella leyó la homilía preparada por el Papa, en la que Francisco enfatizó la importancia de dar sin esperar nada a cambio:\n“Dar sin pedir nada a cambio une, crea vínculos y construye comunión.”\nEl Vaticano desmiente rumores sobre el Papa\nEn medio de la incertidumbre, han circulado versiones en redes sociales asegurando que el Vaticano oculta información sobre la salud del Pontífice. Incluso se ha llegado a especular sobre su posible fallecimiento.\nSin embargo, el Secretario de Estado, cardenal Pietro Parolin, desmintió estos rumores y reiteró que el Papa sigue recibiendo atención médica en el Policlínico Gemelli.\n“Nuestros pensamientos y fervientes oraciones están con el Santo Padre por su salud,” declaró Parolin durante una ceremonia en la Catedral de Sant’Alessandro, en Bérgamo.\n¿Qué sigue para el Pontificado de Francisco?\nCon un pronóstico reservado, la preocupación por la salud del Papa Francisco ha reavivado los rumores sobre una posible renuncia en caso de que su estado no mejore. Aunque no hay declaraciones oficiales al respecto, la situación sigue siendo incierta y el Vaticano mantiene un hermetismo prudente.\nPor ahora, el mundo católico sigue atento a su evolución médica y a las posibles implicaciones que este delicado momento pueda tener para el futuro de la Iglesia.",

    "text": "After expressing concerns over the outlier growth in personal loans, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday raised red flags about the high growth in top-up loans. The governor said some entities are not adhering to regulatory guidelines and asked lenders to monitor the end use of funds as borrowers may be channelling funds into unproductive segments or speculative activities.\n“It is noticed that the regulatory prescriptions relating to loan to value ratio, risk weights and monitoring of end use of funds are not being strictly adhered to by certain entities,” said Das while announcing the monetary policy. “Such practices may lead to loaned funds being deployed into unproductive segments or for speculative purposes. Banks and NBFCs would, therefore, be well-advised to review such practices and take remedial actions.”\nAlso Read Five years on, no takers for independent director data bank His concerns about top-up loans came after the RBI hiked risk weights on unsecured loans by 25 percentage points in November.\nHowever, the governor clarified that surge in top-up housing loans is not a system-wide issue, but confined to a few entities. “Regulatory requirements in top-up housing loans are not being followed by certain entities and it is not a system-level problem.” Such cases are being dealt at the supervisory level bilaterally, Das said.\nA top-up loan allows an existing borrower to borrow more funds without pledging any additional collateral. Monitoring of end use of funds will reduce the risk of overleveraging, said experts.\n“With increased activity levels in the top-up loan segment, RBI’s caution to lenders on calibrating underwriting norms and closer monitoring of the end-use is a step in the right direction. Such loans not only raise concerns about overleveraging, but also fuels suspicion on the quality of such borrowers, as they may use top-up loans to service existing loans,” Anil Gupta, senior vice president, co-group head – financial sector ratings, ICRA.\nThe central bank also reduced the frequency of reporting by banks to credit information companies (CICs) from once a month to once a fortnight. The move will benefit borrowers as their credit information will be updated faster and will bring in more transparency and promote a healthy credit culture.\nAlso Read Govt sounds sovereign funds for offloading its stake in Vi “It is proposed to increase the frequency of reporting of credit information on a fortnightly basis or at shorter intervals,” said Das. “Consequently, borrowers will benefit from faster updation of their credit information, especially when they repay loans. The lenders, on their part, will be able to make better risk assessments of borrowers.”\nTerming the decision as a very progressive move, experts say this will significantly strengthen the credit information ecosystem.\n“With more frequent data reporting by banks and credit institutions, CICs will be able to update credit records faster and this will translate into more updated data being available for making informed lending decisions by credit grantors,” said Rajesh Kumar, MD & CEO, TransUnion CIBIL. “This will also help in resolving consumer disputes faster based on updated data in the credit records.”",
