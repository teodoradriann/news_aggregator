    "text": "Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla to pilot SpaceX Dragon to ISS in May\nMpost Bureau3 April 2025 3:12 AM IST\nMpost Bureau3 April 2025 3:12 AM IST\nNew Delhi: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will make history as the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS) when he joins the Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) scheduled for May 2025.\nThe Indian Air Force veteran will serve as mission pilot aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft launching from NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. The mission represents a milestone in India’s expanding space exploration programme.\n“Even as an individual travelling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,” said Shukla, who is also an astronaut-designate for India’s Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme.\nThe 14-day mission will be commanded by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, with Poland’s Sawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski and Hungary’s Tibor Kapu as mission specialists.\n“This mission demonstrates the growing international nature of space exploration and the important role private missions now play in providing access to low Earth orbit,” said a NASA spokesperson at Tuesday’s press conference.\nDuring his stay on the ISS, Shukla plans to conduct scientific experiments and showcase Indian culture through regional artefacts and yoga demonstrations in microgravity.\n“Captain Shukla’s participation builds on our heritage that began with Rakesh Sharma’s historic flight in 1984,” noted an ISRO official. “This represents not just a technical achievement but a cultural milestone for our nation.”\nThe mission highlights the expanding collaboration between NASA, Axiom Space, and ISRO, positioning India more prominently in the global space community.with agency inputs",

    "text": "News Taylor Swift Has a New Favorite Cinnamon Roll — and We Have the Recipe You can bake the buttery cinnamon rolls that are Travis Kelce's must-have dessert at home. By Chandra Ram Chandra Ram Chandra Ram leads the digital food strategy for Food & Wine. She has 15 years experience writing and editing food content and developing recipes. A former restaurant cook and server, she also writes cookbooks. Food & Wine's Editorial Guidelines Updated on January 5, 2024 Trending Videos If you’re like us, you can’t help following Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance, especially when it involves their love of food. We know Swift is a talented baker who loves to whip up cookies, cakes, and whoopie pies at home. She even inspired a new name for the official state sandwich of New Jersey. Earlier this week, Swift was spotted dining with Brittany Mahomes and a few other wives and girlfriends of Chiefs players at Rye, a favorite spot of Kelce’s in Leawood, Kansas. As dinner wrapped, she had her new beau top of mind, ordering some of the restaurant’s famed cinnamon rolls to go. You may remember that only a few weeks ago, Swift was whipping up some pre-game cinnamon rolls for her favorite player. Whole Chickens, Gallons of Milk, and Other Things Donna Kelce Had to Feed Her NFL Star Sons Rye pastry chef and co-owner Megan Garrelts says Kelce regularly orders these rolls whenever he stops into the restaurant, so she wasn’t surprised when Swift got some to go. Garrelts spent years perfecting these cinnamon rolls, so it’s no wonder Kelce is such a fan. But if Swift ever gets a craving for these while on the road, Garrelts shared the recipe with Food & Wine back in 2019. Taylor, we’ve got you covered with Garrelts’ original Glazed Cinnamon Rolls with Pecan Swirls recipe. At the restaurant, Garrelts will bake and serve these cinnamon rolls straight from mini cast-iron skillets, but she modified her recipe for F&W so home cooks can bake up a batch without any special equipment. The sweet dough is wrapped around a filling of toasted pecans, cinnamon, brown sugar, and sour cream, then baked and topped with a buttery sugar glaze while still warm. The recipe Garrelts shared with us makes 24 cinnamon rolls; she notes that you can keep unbaked rolls in the freezer for up to a month, and then pull them out for your own pre-game brunch party. Which means you can bake some this weekend, and still have a batch in the freezer, ready for breakfast on Super Bowl Sunday. Each bite is tender, sweet, and full of nutty surprises — just like love and football, even if you’re not dating anyone playing in the game that day. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests.\nIf you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported.\nThe once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "title": "Consequences of putting Donald Trump back in White House extremely serious Kamala Harris - The Week",
    "text": "Chicago, Aug 23 (PTI) Describing her Republican rival Donald Trump as an unserious man, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Thursday warned Americans of the consequences of re-electing him for the second term.\n \"We know what a second Trump term would look like. It’s all laid out in 'Project 2025.' ... In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious…,’ Harris said in the excerpts of the speech released by her campaign ahead of her acceptance speech at the United Center here in Chicago.\n “Consider the power he will have — especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled he would be immune from criminal prosecution,\" said Harris who is the first Indian-American ever and the first Black woman to be nominated as the presidential candidate of either the Democratic or the Republican parties.\n At the final night of the Democratic National Convention, Congressman Jason Crow laid out how the Project 2025 agenda will jeopardize the safety and security of the American people, give China and Russia a free rein over the allies, and cut critical benefits for the veterans back at home.\n In the excerpts of the speech released by her campaign Harris said, “We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. This is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from,” she said.\n \"Fellow Americans, I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go — in everyone I meet — I see a nation ready to move forward. Ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America,” she said.\n“I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation. That inspired the world. That here, in this country, anything is possible. Nothing is out of reach,\" Harris said.",
