    "text": "A Sterling Heights woman accused of torturing and abusing her boyfriend's 80-year-old mother will face a trial in Macomb County Circuit Court. Laura Tisdelle , 40, was charged with torture, first-degree vulnerable adult abuse, unlawful imprisonment and third-offense domestic violence. If convicted, she faces up to more than 40 years behind bars, the Macomb County Prosecutor's Office said Thursday.\nTisdelle allegedly was the sole caregiver of her boyfriend's mother while her boyfriend went on a five-day trip in June. Upon his return home, Tisdelle's boyfriend found his mother with her hands tied together, restrained to the bed, severely beaten and laying in her own urine and feces, prosecutors said.\n\"We are committed to pursuing justice for the alleged torture and abuse inflicted upon this elderly woman,\" Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido said in a statement. \"This commitment drives us to passionately advocate for the dignity and well-being of individuals who are unable to protect themselves.\"\nTisdelle was initially arraigned June 23 in the 41A District Court in Sterling Heights.\nHer next court date is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 8.\nJAimery@detroitnews.com",

    "text": "The two-year-old son of famed Canadian producer David Foster and singer Katharine McPhee is lighting up the internet with his musical talents. In a video posted to TikTok by McPhee and Instagram by Foster, the pair’s son is seen playing an impressive drum solo alongside a recording of Michael Jackson’s song “Rock with You.” Foster is seen in the video seated watching his son, bopping his head along to the beat while the two-year-old rocks out on a mini drum set complete with his name, Rennie Foster, splashed across the bass drum. McPhee’s video included the caption “my 2 year old baby is a genius.” Foster, the 74-year-old musician and composer, is a 16-time Grammy winner who was born in Victoria. He married McPhee, a 39-year-old singer and actress who was the runner-up in the 2006 season of American Idol, in 2019. Celebrities like Kristin Chenoweth, Questlove, Nicole Sherzinger, Joey McIntyre, Sharon Stone, Debra Messing, Charlie Puth and others took to the video comments to hype up the young drummer.

    "title": "Newly endowed awards will recognize the academic achievements of U of T Law students",
    "text": "Supplied photo by Calvin Thomas courtesy of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP . A first-of-its-kind gift made by Terry Burgoyne ( LLB 1981 ), a graduate of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, will endow new academic awards recognizing student achievement in U of T’s juris doctor (JD) program.\nThe Burgoyne Award of Excellence will be the faculty’s largest recognition program, awarded to JD students across all three years, as nominated by their professors for scholarly excellence. Up to twenty inaugural awardees, each receiving a $1,000 prize, will be named later this academic year.\n“Supporting our extraordinary students is always one of the faculty’s top priorities. This includes our robust financial aid program, fellowship opportunities and academic prizes,” says University Professor and Dean Jutta Brunnée, James Marshall Tory Dean’s Chair. “It is wonderful that Terry has chosen to endow these new academic awards, which will honour our most exceptional law students every year.”\nA mentor to U of T students for many years, Burgoyne, a partner and general counsel emeritus with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP, says his gift is a meaningful way to stay engaged with the law school and student awardees while bolstering the faculty’s academic prizes.\n“There’s a lot of depth to the law students at U of T because of its high admission standards,” says Burgoyne, himself a Dean’s list student over all three years. “Professors have been looking for ways to help build résumés for their students and distinguish a student who did the best in a particular class.”\n“The hope is that these awards will acquire a certain stature over time and be recognized.”\nFrom rural Nova Scotia to Toronto Burgoyne, who grew up in rural Nova Scotia and attended Dalhousie University for his undergraduate studies, says he never met a lawyer prior to attending U of T. He says his decision to come to the “big unknown city” of Toronto was daunting yet serendipitous – a choice that changed the trajectory of his life and career.\n“My best friend at Dalhousie was applying to law school. We took the LSAT together and applied to the same schools. In those days, [schools] could not send off acceptances before February 1. On February 3, I got my U of T acceptance, but I had not heard from Dalhousie Law School, so I said, ‘Okay, that made my decision easy.’”\nBy the time his Dalhousie acceptance letter arrived – postmarked February 1 – it was early March. At the time, Burgoyne lived only two blocks away from Dalhousie’s law school.\nGratitude is one of the reasons I’ve wanted to give back. Law school had such a profound positive impact on my own life. “I often joke that I’m the Canada Post scholar at U of T Law,” he says. “Had it arrived, it would have been the easier choice to stay [in Nova Scotia]. But I would not have ended up at Osler; Toronto firms did not recruit outside of Ontario in those days,” he says. “I feel lucky in many ways that I picked the right law school for me, the right career and the right firm. These decisions were made with very little information at the time.”\nGratitude is one of the reasons I’ve wanted to give back. Law school had such a profound positive impact on my own life. Burgoyne, who spent his 43-year career at Osler, including six years as managing partner, says he started out as a typical business lawyer, in areas including banking, insolvency, mergers and acquisition and public finance. But as the world became more complicated, Burgoyne says practice became more specialized.\n“Towards the end of my career, I specialized in private or negotiated mergers and acquisitions, as opposed to takeover bids and public mergers and acquisitions,” says Burgoyne. “Law is a tough career sometimes. It’s a lot of work, but it’s a very rewarding career. I’m glad I stuck with it.”\nWords of encouragement He hopes the Burgoyne Award of Excellence will provide awardees with extra validation and encouragement as they pursue their studies.\n“Keep at it. You can find your niche because not everyone is going to be good at everything. If you find the class that you love and you put a lot of effort into it, there’s a reward for that,” he says.\n“Gratitude is one of the reasons I’ve wanted to give back. Law school had such a profound positive impact on my own life.”\nExplore related campaign priorities: Contribute your time and talent Support student success",

    "text": "10-year-old nonverbal autistic girl attacked on school van, mom says\nBy Ricky Sayer\nClick here for updates on this story\nPITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (\nKDKA) — A private school transportation service will no longer transport students to and from Pittsburgh Conroy Education Center after a mother went public with how her autistic and nonverbal 10-year-old daughter was left with bite marks and bruises all over her body.\nThe girl’s mother, Shareena Johnson, told KDKA-TV that Pittsburgh Public Schools officials told her another student attacked her daughter while she was riding a van to Conroy Education Center on Monday. Johnson was called to the school and told her she should bring her daughter to the hospital.\n“They said she had been bit and scratched,” Johnson said. “When I got there, I was in complete shock. I could not have imagined the severity of the injuries on her body. I had never seen bite marks so deep. The bruising and the swelling were awful. I was told that she was shaking and still actively being attacked when the van pulled into the school. The driver did not pull over. He did not call anyone.”\nPittsburgh Public Schools contracts Krise Transportation to pick up and drop off students at Conroy.\n“All the other children were also nonverbal on the van. There is no evidence as to what happened, how it happened, how long it occurred,” Johnson said.\nShe said the company told her it had a video of what happened on the bus. But when she called the district the next day to see the video, she was told there was no recording because it was a new van.\nJohnson wants the company to do something.\n“I want the driver to take accountability. I want them to change their protocol to one that actually keeps children safe,” Johnson said.\nAs for her daughter, because she is nonverbal, answering a simple question isn’t easy.\n“We don’t know how she’s doing. And that is why it’s so hard for me because I know it’s hard for her,” Johnson said.\nWhen KDKA-TV asked Pittsburgh Public Schools for comment, it said Krise Transportation would no longer transport students to and from Conroy.\nKDKA-TV followed up by asking if Krise provides transportation for students at any other Pittsburgh schools and if changes would be made. The district responded by reiterating how Krise Transportation would no longer transport students to Conroy.\n“As this incident involves students, no further information is available,” a PPS spokesperson said.\nJohnson called the change surprising, saying Krise transported students on Wednesday afternoon. But she said it is good news, adding Krise Transportation should not transport students to any Pittsburgh school.\nKDKA-TV called called Krise Transportation on Wednesday. A representative hung up before we could directly ask for comment.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "[HackerRuso](/user/HackerRuso)a [ambito.com](/go/link/3916814) [#5](c5#c-5) No está pidiendo la paz. Está pidiendo la rendición del agredido, en lugar de la retirada del agresor.\nEso de pacífico no tiene una mierda.\n-----\nIgual que todos los que veo por aquí graznando que la rendición es lo lógico porque Ucrania no tiene posibilidad de defenderse. Si tirásemos al río a todos los burros que corren por aquí, más de un pantano desbordaría.\nSiguiendo esa lógica subnormal, cada vez que a un país le dé por invadir a otro por las bravas, tan sólo hay que evaluar si tiene capacidad de matar más gente que el otro. Y el país invadido que se joda. Muy pacífico todo, claro que sí.\nPara que os enteréis, Putin perdió esta invasión el día 1, porque evidentemente intentaba repetir en los oblast de Donbass la ocupación relámpago de Crimea. Le salió como el culo, de hecho no le salió en absoluto, y como apostó su prestigio político al resultado ha montado una guerra para no reconocer su fracaso.\nNi de coña es Ucrania la que debe rendirse. Si China deja de alimentar al hijo tonto, en dos meses los rusos empezarán a pasar hambre y veremos rodar la cabeza de Putin y el fin de esta invasión al día siguiente.\n[#120](c120#c-120) No te quedes en el titular, lee el texto de la noticia.\n\"El que ve la situación, el que piensa en la gente, el que tiene el coraje de izar la bandera blanca para negociar es más fuerte. Hoy podemos negociar con la ayuda de las potencias internacionales\"\nNo pide que se rindan. Pide que deje de haber muertos sin sentido y que se empiece a negociar. Y eso es lo que decimos muchos.\n[#93](c93#c-93) >\nPorque el que dispara no tiene más remedio que disparar y matarlos.\nLos argumentos sionistas son escoria humana.\n[#113](c113#c-113)\nFinlandia tuvo que ceder territorio a la URSS. Y después de la segunda guerra mundial, no le quedó otra que firmar un acuerdo con la URSS donde se comprometía a no entrar en la OTAN. La política exterior de Finlandia estuvo marcada por los intereses estratégicos de la URSS.\nLee un poco de Historia.\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tratado_de_Amistad,_Cooperaci%C3%B3n_y_Asistencia_Mutua_Fino-Sovi%C3%A9tico\n[#46](c46#c-46) Ucrania no tiene barcos de guerra porque estaban en Sebastopol cuando Rusia invadió Crimea en 2014.\nUn poco tramposo tu comentario. No han perdido la flota en esta guerra, les fue robada por sorpresa seis años antes. Justamente por fiarse de Rusia y alquilarles la base de Sebastopol.\nY tampoco es que la fuerza naval pinte mucho en la invasión de Ucrania, que digamos.\n[#46](c46#c-46) Solo por recordar, a Rusia le quedan entre dos tercios y la mitad de los buques del mar Negro que tenia operativos cuando invadió Crimea. Los ucranianos estan siendo sorprendentemente efectivos reasignando activos a la armada submarina rusa, y se está hablando poco de ello...\n[#148](c148#c-148) Bueno, mas que a los ucranianos a los UK y EEUU que son quienes les dan los barquitos, pero si, estan haciendo daño con las lanchas suicidas\n[#155](c155#c-155) Por lo que sea. Pero date cuenta del detalle: que tengas mas tanques, mas barcos o mas gente que el enemigo, solo tiene valor en cuanto a como de caro o barato le sale al enemigo quitarte tanques, barcos o gente.\nRecuerda. Un bando quiere ganar. El otro puede que tambien quiera ganar, o puede conformarse con que el primer bando no gane. Y ahí las cosas se vuelven menos predecibles. En palabras del antiguo filosofo, \"...o la puta al rio\".\n[#10](c10#c-10) No, no es como si España entrara en guerra con USA. Es como si USA invadiera España para robarla.\nY por lo visto tú abogarías por regalarle al invasor todas las regiones industrializadas y toda la costa turística del país (que son los territorios que ha tomado Rusia en Ucrania). Como si eso no supusiera directamente la muerte de tu país.\nPor cierto, ¿en qué cabeza seca ”que muera gente” es responsabilidad del invadido y no del invasor?\n[#12](c12#c-12) ¿Realista que Rusia se vaya a cambio de nada, después del coste humano y económico que ha sufrido en la guerra? Que mañana baje Dios y pare la guerra con sus poderes es más realista que eso que propones.\n[#72](c72#c-72) Sonaría aberrante porque hay infinitos casos de palestinos alzando la bandera blanca y siendo acribillados igualmente por el ejército israelí.\nMás que aberrante, suena estúpido comparar una guerra con un genocidio en donde el pueblo masacrado no puede hacer absolutamente nada para parar la agresión.\n[#29](c29#c-29) \"solo hay dos tipos de personas a favor de la guerra:\nlos que saben que no van a participar\ny los que no tienen ni idea de qué es la guerra\"\n[#76](c76#c-76) Las hostilidades cesaron en marzo de 1940 con la firma del Tratado de Paz de Moscú. Finlandia cedió el 11 % de su territorio que representa el 30 % de su economía a la Unión Soviética\n[#15](c15#c-15) En esos argumentos hay muchísimo de propaganda rusa. Antes de la llegada de los hombrecitos verdes en 2014 al Dombas, está era una zona tranquila sin mayores ansias independentistas de las que pudiera tener el país vasco.\nEl problema es que de repente apareció todo un ejército en estas regiones totalmente agresivo y expansionista. Solo hay que ver el avión de pasajeros derribado con armamento especializado.\nPor poner un caso 100% documentado: el tribunal holandés que juzgo el asesinato de los 300 pasajeros determinó que de los 4 responsables directos, 3 fueron oficiales rusos y solo un ucraniano independentista. Y que el lanzamisiles es propiedad ruso, y fue trasladado inmediatamente a Moscú tras el atentado.\nYo no sé cómo hay gente que se traga la propaganda habiendo tanta información contrastada. Y no sólo eso; a estas alturas este proceder de acudir en \"auxilio\" de las minorías rusas, meter mercenarios o soldados encubiertos, tomar la zona responsabilizando a los independentistas, ya se había repetido en Georgia o Moldavia anteriormente.\n[#10](c10#c-10) supongo que pedirá lo mismo a Hamas y a Palestina, que enarbolen la bandera blanca de la paz y negocien, lo que supondría la anexión de Gaza y la expulsión de un par de millones de palestinos de ese territorio.\n[#136](c136#c-136) Los bloques globales se acabaron con la Guerra Fría, la única que queda es Europa que sigue a EEUU al precipicio.\n[#55](c55#c-55) no se por que lo comentas, pero ya lo se, y los ucranianos también son ortodoxos pero tienen otro líder religioso distinto a Cirilo de Moscú.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Ucrania puede ganar si la ayudamos.\nLa pregunta es ¿Quieres que Rusia aprenda que puede invadir a cualquier país indefenso? ¿O quieres que Rusia aprenda que no hay países indefensos?\n[#132](c132#c-132) ¿O quieres que Rusia aprenda que no hay países indefensos?\n¿Cuándo EEUU invadió Irak, Afganistan o Vietnam no era países indefensos?\n[#134](c134#c-134) Sin duda el resto de países no aliados de EEUU deberían haber ayudado a Irak, Afganistán, Libia, etc.\nPero a mí no se me ocurre criticar a Irán o china por no ayudar a Ucrania a defenderse de rusia. Eso sería absurdo.\nDel mismo modo no tiene sentido que España ayude a Afganistán a defenderse de EEUU, o a Gaza a defenderse de Israel, al mismo tiempo que tiene todo el sentido que ayude a Ucrania a defenderse de Rusia.\n[#110](c110#c-110) Mientras no lo hagan, para ti, 30000 civiles están bien matados. Imagino que 300000 o dos millones y medio también estarán bien matados, porque poner un límite en cualquier cifra sería un límite arbitrario.\n[#141](c141#c-141) No manipules. No apoyo a ninguna parte. Creo que se entiende claro y no tiene nada que ver con lo que dices.\n[#96](c96#c-96) Ucrania no ha perdido nada. Aún es territorio en disputa\nLa desnazificacion es propaganda fascista rusa para justificar la invasión, y Ucrania va a entrar en OTAN\nLo de Transnistria no es invento, mira el mapa de Medenev del otro día\nEl acuerdo de paz llegará cuando Rusia se retire de todo el territorio Ucraniano, y entregue a Putin como criminal de guerra\n[#42](c42#c-42) La tenía perdida desde el día uno de la invasión cuando los tanques iban a para Kiev, se les facilitó una ayuda externa que les hizo aguantar hasta la famosa reconquista que por filtraciones, espionaje o lo que sea no dió sus frutos, fue un fracaso, ahora lo que hay es, o más picadora, hasta el último, o nos metemos en la guerra contra rusia.\n[#99](c99#c-99) ¿Por qué occidente debería involucrarse en Israel? Yo considero que ninguno de los 2 bandos merece ser apoyado.\n[#104](c104#c-104) Porque se está cometiendo un genocidio y bombardeando a la población civil con armas occidentales. Porque va contra la convención d Ginebra y los DDHH. Porque es terrorismo de Estado. Porque son nuestros aliados y amigos, y hasta los invitamos a nuestros festivales de la canción y comerciamos con ellos. Porque nosotros creamos el Estado de Israel, una colonia europea supremacista blanca. Porque han asesinado a 10.000 niños. Porque han atacado la sede de la UNRWA y destruido la práctica totalidad de los hospitales. Porque han bombardeado campos de refugiados. Porque están bloqueando la ayuda humanitaria. Porque no reconocen a Palestina, pero tienen a los palestinos en una cárcel a cielo abierto. Y por muchas más razones.\n[#108](c108#c-108) Si los palestinos entregaran a los civiles secuestrados ok a todo lo que dices, mientras no lo hagan no tomo parte.\n[#71](c71#c-71) ”sin intentar engañar a los demás con las causas del conflicto”.\n¿Estás insinuando que Ucrania es responsable de que Rusia pretenda robarle los tres oblast que son con diferencia la mayor fuente de riqueza del país?\n¿Te has preguntado por qué Rusia no va a por las capitales (Kiev u Odessa)? ¿Por qué invade solamente las regiones que generan más dinero y se la suda todo el resto de Ucrania, que es rural?\nEl único engañado con las causas del conflicto eres tú, que no ves que esto es un atraco y nada más. Es el robo descarado de las fuentes de riqueza de un país, a manos de un matón extranjero. Ucrania no puede rendirse si no quiere morir de hambruna al día siguiente.\n[#31](c31#c-31) Te crees tu que si USA nos declarara la guerra, íbamos a tener opción a elegir si estábamos en los buques o no...\n[#153](c153#c-153) ¿Cómo los palestinos, que también pueden elegir rendirse? En una guerra, solo puedes hacer planes de lo que va a hacer la mitad de la gente. La otra mitad va a hacer sus propios planes, generalmente en tu contra...\n[#161](c161#c-161) ...tanques, soldados, artillería, bombardeos con fosforo blanco, helicopteros artillados...\nSi no es una guerra, se parece un cojón y medio a una. Ah, bueno, espera. Uno de los dos bandos no tiene ni tanques ni soldados ni artilleria ni... si, es verdad. No es una guerra exactamente. Se parece más a una matanza, sí.\n[#162](c162#c-162) a ver, y que ejercitos se enfrentan. Porqué yo veo una limpieza étnica, nada que ver con una guerra\n[#60](c60#c-60) Los ucranianos se rindieron hace dos años.\nOtra cosa es el que nazi hijo de la gran puta de su presidente y los países corruptos que le ceban de armas para que siga masacrando a su población y así pueda lucrarse el hijo de puta de Biden y todos los hijos de puta que tienen acciones en la industria armamentística que se están forrando en EEUU, así como todos los hijos de la gran puta que dirigen Europa, desde la puta psicópata Bonder Leyen al hijo de la gran puta de Pedro mierda, pasando por la manga de hijos de puta corruptos que están sentados en el parlamento europeo, que siguen animando al pueblo ucraniano a defender su honor y toda esa basura de discurso.\nEl pueblo ucraniano se caga en la puta madre de toda está escoria que se está forrando a costa de sus vidas\nEllos se han rendido hace mucho. Pero no les dejan irse a su casa.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Que desnortados estáis algunos. En Ucrania hay un gobierno nazi, y ni siquiera ocultan serlo homenajeando a nazis. Putin será lo que quieras, pero fascista desde luego que no. A ver si sabemos reconocer las ideologías, que basta haber ido a la escuela primaria.",

    "title": "La Ville «très satisfaite» du déneigement",
    "text": "«On a réussi à faire ce qu’on voulait faire. Il n’y a pas eu d’enjeux», insiste le directeur du déneigement de la Ville de Québec, François Moisan. «Le seul enjeu qu’on a eu, c’est la très grosse quantité de neige qui est tombée.» Dans les deux derniers jours, le fonctionnaire a accordé des dizaines d’entrevues pour répéter la même chose : la Ville est «très satisfaite» de son enlèvement de la neige. Mais sur les réseaux sociaux comme dans les médias, les critiques fusent par rapport aux opérations de derniers jours. Plusieurs citoyens des quartiers centraux s’étonnent de voir leur rue encore enneigée même après deux jours de «feux clignotants», où leur routine a été perturbée par une opération déneigement. Des commerçants de la haute-ville se sont plaints de l’indisponibilité des stationnements et le manque d’accès aux trottoirs a été dénoncé. Vendredi, à la veille d’une autre tempête majeure, la Ville de Québec a annoncé une troisième nuit d’opération déneigement consécutive dans plusieurs quartiers. Deux nuits, «c’est normal» Le porte-parole de la Ville de Québec comprend l’impatience de ceux qui habitent dans un secteur où le travail n’est pas complété. Mais il insiste: il est «normal» qu’une opération de si grande envergure s’étale sur deux nuits. Et ce n’est rien de nouveau, martèle François Moisan, qui gravite dans l’administration municipale depuis plus de vingt ans. «Il n’y a rien d’anormal à prendre deux nuits pour une tempête d’une telle ampleur.»— François Moisan, directeur des relations publiques à la Ville de Québec M. Moisan souligne d’ailleurs que les tempêtes avec plus de 30 centimètres de neige, comme celle du début de la semaine, sont «rares». «On a des hivers où on n’a pas d’épisode comme celui-là», rapporte-t-il. «C’était une grosse tempête, ça prend de grosses opérations. Aux dires du maire Bruno Marchand, les équipes analysent «en continu» leurs processus. Mais demeure qu’«une tempête, c’est un chaos», souligne-t-il. «Il tombe 3 cm à Paris et ils sont bloqués pendant trois jours. Ici, il tombe 35 cm. Les gens de Québec sont exigeants — et ils ont raison de l’être — [mais] il faut gérer le chaos le moins longtemps possible et c’est pour ça qu’on travaille à toujours s’améliorer», a-t-il déclaré en entrevue avec Le Soleil jeudi. Des opérations «ciblées», bientôt «améliorées» La Ville de Québec fait tout en son pouvoir pour éviter à ses résidents de déplacer leurs voitures pour rien, assure le fonctionnaire. Mais lors des opérations déneigement, l’administration municipale préfère voir grand et libérer plus de rues que pas assez. «On espère toujours pouvoir tout faire en une nuit, résume François Moisan. Et on planifie en conséquence. Mais parfois, selon la quantité de neige, la lourdeur de celle-ci, les pépins mécaniques ou les remorquages, on n’y arrive pas». Le dégagement des voies de circulation est alors priorisé. «On cible le plus possible avec les feux clignotants, mais parfois les opérations prévues sont modifiées en cours de route.»— François Moisan, directeur des relations publiques à la Ville de Québec Le «ciblage» des rues appelées à se mettre en mode déneigement pourrait être amélioré dans les prochaines années, indique le fonctionnaire. L’ajout de nombreux feux clignotants d’un bout à l’autre de la ville et [les investissements en télémétrie](https://www.lesoleil.com/actualites/actualites-locales/la-capitale/2023/11/17/deneigement-suivre-les-grattes-en-temps-reel-bientot-possible-a-quebec-N766FZ6WWVECLEG4JZ3BFQCUGE/) rendront le suivi des équipes de la ville plus facile. Et pour la tempête prévue samedi, François Moisan l’assure : «les formidables les équipes de la Ville de Québec sont prêtes». Avec Émilie Pelletier, Le Soleil",

    "text": "This is one of the most romantic television commercials we’ve seen, and it just happens to be gay.\nThe personal lubricant brand,\nBoy Butter, has released the third installment of a love story trilogy between two men, Facundo Rodriguez and Jerreth Ludwig. The video – titled “Chateau D’Amour” – opens with a sweeping shot of a French country setting. We discover Ludwig in an ivy-covered house and Rodriguez racing through the forest. The men soon find themselves face-to-face and reach for each other for a romantic kiss.\nBoy Butter founder Eyal Feldman calls the spot “our grandest commercial to date.” Donna Feldman, Eyal’s sister and co-founder of Straw Hat Productions, who produced the ad, explains the arc of the love story trilogy: “Our\nfirst commercial was about empowerment, the second was glamour, and the third one is pure romance—a short film only thirty seconds long, seldom seen in television advertising today.”\nThe sensual new ad spot will debut on national TV on Friday, January 5, during Season 16 of RuPaul’s Drag Race on MTV. The commercial will air in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, and nationwide in Canada on OutTV. Boy Butter has been running ad spots in support of RPDR since 2012. In 2021, Straw Hat and Feldman launched this\n new campaign reminiscent of iconic 1990s fragrance and fashion campaigns.\nFollowing tonight’s premiere, Boy Butter plans to expand the campaign to broader market outlets, including CNBC and Fox Business, and make a splash on sports networks, such as ESPN, Fox Sports, and NFL Network.\nFounded in 2003,\nhttp://boybutter.com/ manufactures personal lubricants that are long lasting, organic, hypo-allergenic, and washable.",
