    "text": "Turkish news anchor Meltem Günay was fired on Sunday 24 December after bringing a clearly visible Starbucks cup with him on air. This is reported by the channel itself on Twitter/X, relayed by several international media such as The Independent . The coffee cup is to blame Günay worked as a news anchor at the Turkish, pro-Erdogan television channel TGRT. Several viewers are said to have reacted to the Starbucks cup standing in front of the news anchor on last Sunday’s broadcast. Many consider Starbucks to be pro-Israel, and the coffee cup was thus perceived as a political stance from Günay. Several famous faces have seriously made Snapchat an important platform to show off in recent times. It has also become a solid source of income for Isabel Raad, who for the first time reveals to her followers exactly how much she earns daily. view more In a statement from the TV channel they write that both the news anchor and the producer of the broadcast were fired as a result of inappropriate product placement. – In line with the institution’s principles, it is strictly forbidden for the anchor to promote any company, the statement says. Rage after this: – Disrespectful TGRT further writes that they recognize the Turkish people’s support for Gaza, and that they condemn the actions of the news anchor and the producer. It’s boiling around Starbucks According to the news agency Reuters a boycott campaign is spreading among Arab countries against Western brands and chains, such as Starbucks and McDonald’s. It is happening in the wake of the war between Hamas and Israel, which flared up again in October. Starbucks, like several other big brands, has recently received criticism and been accused of taking sides in the conflict. 2023-12-28 20:52:35 #fired",

    "text": "Whether we will convene the negotiations in a few days or will we need more time depends on the first meetings of the negotiating groups and what they will agree on. We need a regular government, we have been repeating this for a long time. GERB - UDF have given their best possible figures to the negotiating team (Raya Nazaryan, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Tomislav Donchev and Daniel Mitov - ed.). If the negotiating teams do not come to an agreement, things will end faster. For me, there is hope and an agreement will be reached. Then we will need more time to fully review the governing program.\nThis was stated on the show \"Denyat na Zievo\" on NOVA NEWS the chairman of the UDF and a deputy from GERB - UDF Rumen Hristov, who commented on the political situation in the country and the possibilities for forming a regular government.\n\"I am very worried about the proposed budget from the caretaker cabinet. I don't see how we will vote on the budget by December 31. It is almost impossible. It would be better to enter the new year with an extended budget and if things go well for a regular cabinet, for the cabinet to propose a budget\", Hristov was categorical.\n\"The PP has demonstrated throughout the entire time an unwillingness to talk about the important topic of a regular government. We never intended to split the PP-DB, as happened now with these negotiations. This is their decision, as was the case during a landmark vote for the speaker of the parliament, when they split again. We are elevating Boyko Borisov as prime minister because of his experience, contacts and international ties. All of this will help us enter the Eurozone. There is nothing more logical than for the largest party, which has been winning elections for several times in a row, to be appointed prime minister. Let's use its opportunities. We have also appointed an expert cabinet and nothing has come of it. With experts, it is not known who is responsible. The political cabinet is responsible to its voters. Are there no experts in our group? Let's see what will happen during the negotiations. I know for sure that the BSP and the ITN have accepted the invitation to negotiations. I cannot say anything about the DB. If things do not work out with the first mandate, I do not see how they will work out with the second and third. We have already played this movie,\" Hristov announced.\n\"The prosecutor's office is an independent body, I cannot comment on its actions. Requesting immunities could hinder the negotiations, because someone could decide that we want to split the PP-DB and are behind these demands. I will repeat again that we do not aim for such a split. \"For me, the request for immunities is late, because it is for things that happened 2-3 years ago, but the prosecution decided so, did so,\" commented Rumen Hristov on the requested immunities of Kiril Petkov and Lena Borislavova.",

    "text": "Justice Department says new Texas immigration law violates Constitution\nBy Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams, CNN\nWashington (CNN) — A new law that gives local law enforcement in Texas the authority to arrest migrants “violates the US Constitution,” the Department of Justice said in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday, threatening to sue unless Abbott backs down from enforcing it.\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, marks the latest escalation between President Joe Biden and Abbott over the handling of the US-Mexico border.\nEarlier this month, Abbott, a Republican, signed into law the measure, known as\n Senate Bill 4, which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and gives judges the ability to issue orders to remove people from the United States. The White House slammed the law, calling it “incredibly extreme.” It’s expected to take effect in March.\nPrincipal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott Thursday that “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.”\nWhile the federal government is “committed to … securing the border,” Boynton wrote, the Texas law is “contrary to these goals.”\nThe ongoing surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border has placed immense pressure on local and federal resources. Thursday’s legal threat follows a DOJ lawsuit against Texas earlier this year over the state’s use of\n floating barriers in the Rio Grande. That lawsuit is still making its way through the courts.\nThe enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility, and opponents of the Texas measure argue it’s unconstitutional.\nThe law has sent ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in Texas, which makes up\n40% of the state’s population. Civil-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit seeking to block the measure.\nThe Justice Department’s threat to sue comes on the heels of a\nhigh-levels talks between senior US and Mexican officials this week\nOfficials from both countries described talks as productive, and Mexican officials are\nexpected to visit Washington next month to continue the discussions.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Mexico Is for Mujeres: The Next Mexican President Will Be a Woman",
    "text": "When voters go to the polls in June, one of two women will be elected Mexico’s next president—proving the potency of the country’s constitutional mandate for “parity in everything.”\nThis article appears in the Winter 2024 issue of Ms. magazine.\nJoin the Ms . community today and you’ll get issues delivered straight to your mailbox.\nThe two women vying to become the next president of Mexico begin their final campaigns on Friday, March 1.\nIndigenous politician Xóchitl Gálvez has come a long way. Born and raised in a town with fewer than 12,000 people, she shared one bedroom with her four brothers. Her father abused her mother.\nHer opponent is the former Mexico City Governor Claudia Sheinbaum. A native of the capital megacity, Sheinbaum is the daughter of two scientists; she’s a former student activist and among the country’s few Jewish politicians.\nSheinbaum and Gálvez represent the country’s two most significant forces. Between them, they are pulling over\n90 percent of the vote. Mexico will surely elect its first woman president on June 2, 2024—and she will be an ethnic minority woman.\nSheinbaum carries the flag for Morena, the governing party. Founded by current president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO, as he is known), this populist left party holds the most seats in Congress and governs 21 of the country’s 32 states. Mexican presidents cannot stand for reelection, and Sheinbaum bested an otherwise all-male field in Morena’s presidential primary.\nGálvez heads the opposition alliance, called Broad Front for Mexico, comprised principally of some of Mexico’s oldest parties, which together represent the traditional left, center and right. Gálvez herself comes from the right, the party of former Mexican Presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón.\nSheinbuam and Gálvez are well-matched. Their differing class backgrounds notwithstanding, their careers have run in parallel. They are both engineers turned politicians. They both secured prestigious executive appointments and won top electoral races at the same time.\nSheinbaum holds a Ph.D. in energy engineering, has worked in academia and industry, and served on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. She entered politics in 2000, when AMLO—then mayor of Mexico City—appointed her minister of the environment. She then won elected office: first as head Mexico City’s Tlapan district, and, in 2018, as Mexico City’s chief executive.\nGálvez arrived in Mexico City with a scholarship to study computer engineering. After graduation, she founded a tech company and became a well-known figure in Mexico’s start-up and business scene. She also entered politics in 2000, when Fox invited her to lead the National Institute of Indigenous Affairs. She was later elected head of Mexico City’s Manuel Hidalgo district and, in 2018, senator for the state of Mexico City.\nParity had accustomed Mexican voters to seeing women compete among each other for top offices. … Yet gender parity cannot mask Mexico’s reputation as a ‘femicide nation.’\nStarting in the 1980s, Mexico underwent a protracted transition to a multiparty democracy, principally by changing its electoral laws to allow for more competition. Each electoral reform offered women candidates an opportunity:\n- When negotiating the 1996 law, women legislators joined together, working across the aisle to secure a recommendation that parties offer women 30 percent of candidacies for the federal Congress.\n- They transformed this recommendation into an obligation in 2002, and they raised this “gender quota” to 40 percent in 2008.\n- In 2014, a constitutional reform mandated gender parity among candidates for the federal and state congresses.\n- In 2019, another constitutional reform established “parity in everything”: all offices in the executive, legislative and judicial branches at the federal, state and municipal levels must be held by men and women in equal numbers. Gálvez was among the women senators who wrote and advocated for the amendment.\nThanks to\nthree decades of innovation, Gálvez, Sheinbaum and hundreds of women received the chance to run for and serve in office. Women hold 50 percent of the seats in the Mexican Congress and 31 percent of the governorships. Mexico’s parties can no longer claim—like they did when gender quotas were first introduced—that “they don’t have any women to run.”\nIn fact, Sheinbaum was Morena’s presumptive nominee long before the September 2023 primary. Months before, Sheinbaum had begun using the\nslogans, “The time for women” and “Mexico with ‘M’ for women” (the Spanish word for women is mujeres).\n“Parity in everything” does not apply to a unitary office like the presidency, but Sheinbaum’s positioning likely pushed the opposition to nominate a woman. After all, parity had accustomed Mexican voters to seeing women compete among each other for top offices. The alliance coalesced around Gálvez, who had already built a reputation for challenging AMLO. Famously, she said a person needed “ovaries” to confront him.\n‘Femicide Nation’\nYet gender parity cannot mask Mexico’s reputation as a “femicide nation.” Some estimates suggest that 10 women are murdered in the country every day. Less than 10 percent of these crimes are reported or investigated.\nGálvez and Sheinbaum both call themselves feminists. Their parties’ records on violence against women—and women’s rights more broadly—tell another story.\nAMLO routinely ignores feminists’ demands to end impunity for abusers, calling leaders of the anti-femicide protests\n“conservatives” and barricading government buildings when they march. In March 2020, when COVID-19 trapped people at home and more than 26,000 reports of domestic violence flooded Mexico’s emergency hotline, AMLO dismissed 90 percent as fake. And when the Mexican Supreme Court decriminalized abortion in 2021, AMLO said the decision should be respected but declined to comment further.\nThe president’s refusal to defend women’s rights boxes Sheinbaum into a corner. Morena’s electoral success hinges on AMLO’s popularity and Sheinbaum needs his endorsement to win. She cannot afford to contradict him.\nAs the opposition candidate, Gálvez can criticize AMLO freely. She filmed a\ncampaign ad where she donned Mexico’s famous lucha libre boxing costume, telling voters she’s ready to “fight against infernal insecurity, crushing violence, the power of misogyny and the demons of corruption.”\nBut past presidents from her own party have done no better when it comes to protecting women and establishing security. Under Fox and Calderón, several Mexican states passed constitutional amendments making abortion illegal. Both presidents escalated the violent confrontations between drug cartels, organized criminal groups, and the security forces. This militarization in turn fueled\nsharp spikes in the femicide rate. AMLO has continued rather than reversed the course.\nUneven Gender Equality Gains\nOn the books, Mexico’s 2007 law to prevent, punish and eradicate violence against women is deeply progressive. The\n29-page statute envisions not just proportionate punishment for abusers, but justice for victims at every stage of the process. It requires support like free counseling, state assistance in finding shelter, and Indigenous interpreters when victims do not speak Spanish. After all, the law was written by the very women legislators that gender quotas brought into office.\nYet politicians can change laws faster than they can change centuries-old patterns of discrimination and sexism. Attitudes matter, because it is actors that carry out the law.\nGender quotas—and now gender parity—work in Mexico because their implementation is straightforward. Penalties are clear: if parties fail to nominate the required number of women, they cannot compete. Enforcement is also clear: a single executive agency, the National Electoral Institute, verifies parties’ candidate registries. When disputes arise, they are settled by separate, independent electoral courts, which are fewer, smaller, and more professionalized.\nBy contrast, the agencies and entities charged with implementing the law to protect women from violence are numerous. The coordination required among them is complex. Lawmakers cannot single-handedly engrain the spirit of the law into the minds and actions of every police office, prosecutor, judge and social worker—actors that long\nhave dismissed and minimized violence against women.\nVoting for a woman also does not require voters to hold feminist attitudes. Candidates do not just represent themselves; they represent parties and party labels matter in Mexico. Sheinbaum and Gálvez lead very different political forces. Their task is not to convince voters that women can lead, but that their political coalition offers Mexico the best chance for prosperity and security.\nMexico’s women-led presidential race does not reveal a feminist utopia, but it does signal possibility. In a country where women—especially minority women—struggle to survive, Gálvez and Sheinbaum studied science, shaped policy, and crafted resumes worthy of presidential bids. One of them will now shatter the political glass ceiling.\nUp next:\nU.S. democracy is at a dangerous inflection point—from the demise of abortion rights, to a lack of pay equity and parental leave, to skyrocketing maternal mortality, and attacks on trans health. Left unchecked, these crises will lead to wider gaps in political participation and representation.

    "text": "Huskers will not have traditional spring football game in 2025 Danny Jaillet Cornhuskers Wire Nebraska football will reportedly not have a traditional spring game this year, according to athletic director Troy Dannen. He made the announcement during a radio appearance on Wednesday.\nDannen did indicate that there be some sort of spring event on April 26 featuring the football team. The Red-White game has traditionally been held in April, giving the coaching staff a chance to assess the team's talent for the upcoming year.\nRising NIL deals and revenue are also factors that have been cited as factors in not having a spring game. Dannen noted that the injuries suffered during last year’s spring game stuck out to him, as reported by HuskerOnline’s Sean Callahan. He also indicated that any events that the Huskers have planned may not be televised.\n“One of my first experiences here last year, we had two ACL (knee injuries) during that game,” Dannen said. “It’s a different era from a compensation standpoint from the NIL and the investment there. The transfer portal opens up right after the spring game dates.\n“I expect something that’s not going to be televised, but something that will be a celebration of our athletes and get to see some skills and see what they got, and go from there.”\nIt will certainly be interesting to see what the program comes up with as college football enters a new era. The landscape of collegiate athletics is ever-changing, and it appears that Huskers are adapting to the times.",

    "title": "Maliek Collins on joining 49ers, playing for Kris Kocurek, replacing Arik Armstead",
    "text": "Today, the San Francisco 49ers officially announced the acquisition of Houston Texans defensive tackle Maliek Collins. Shortly after the announcement, the team made their new defensive lineman available to reporters via Zoom. One thing was evident: Collins has been eager to play under defensive line coach Kris Kocurek for a considerable time. Videos are auto-populated by an affiliate. This site has no control over the videos that appear above. The two met at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2016, and those conversations in Indianapolis made Collins a fan of Kocurek. When asked to explain what excites him about Kocurek, Collins responded, \"It was just his passion that he brings to the game, how he's all about getting a dub, and he wants to [have] the most productive defensive line, and he wants to be number one in everything. That's something that I want to come in, I want to contribute to, and I'm excited to be coached and coach hard.\" Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans was the one to deliver the news of the trade to Collins, informing the defensive lineman of the move on Wednesday. \"It kind of happened fast,\" Collins admits. \"You can't really dwell on anything. You just move forward. Everything happens for a reason. I feel like being here, the love that you get, how people embrace you, I think this is the best situation that could have possibly happened.\" Collins mentioned that he is fairly familiar with at least one of his new teammates. During the offseason, he trained with defensive tackle [Javon Hargrave](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HargJa00.htm). He has also watched some of the other 49ers defensive linemen in the past. When asked about replacing defensive tackle [Arik Armstead](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/ArmsAr01.htm), who is now with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the new 49ers defensive lineman praised his predecessor. \"I don't think you replace a player like Arik Armstead, the person that he is in the community, the person that he is on the field. I don't think you replace that. I'm just here to add my skill set and bring who I am to the table.\" Collins understands that he is joining a championship contender and is determined to contribute to his new team's quest for a Super Bowl victory, especially after the 49ers came close last season. \"It couldn't be a better situation, a story franchise like this. At this point in my career, I'm excited,\" Collins stated. He added, \"Just coming in and adding to the success it's already been had. This is the team that was in the Super Bowl last year. This is a team that was in the Super Bowl in 2019. Just seeing that success and seeing the NFC Championships and all that, I just want to come in and help bridge that gap to get us over the hump.\"",
