    "title": "New demands from Israel are stalling the deal",
    "text": "Disagreement over Israel's future military presence in Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners is hindering a truce and hostage deal, sources familiar with the latest round of US-brokered talks, which ended last Sunday, told Reuters. The sources, including two Hamas officials and three Western diplomats, told the British agency that the disagreement stemmed from demands made by Israel after Hamas accepted a version of a truce proposal presented by President Joe Biden in May. All the sources said Hamas was particularly concerned about the latest demand that Israeli soldiers remain along the Netzarim Corridor, the east-west strip that Israel \"cleared\" during the current war and which prevents the free movement of Palestinians between north and south Gaza, as well as the narrow border strip. between Gaza and Egypt, known as the Philadelphia Corridor. Israel's current control of the Philadelphia Corridor allows it to manage Gaza's border with Egypt, the only crossing point in the enclave that does not border Israel. Hamas believes that Israel changed its conditions and parameters at the last minute, and fears that new demands could follow each concession, said one of the sources. In a press release on Sunday, Hamas said the proposal that emerged from last week's talks was too similar to Benjamin Netanyahu's recent positions that set new terms. They urged negotiators to stick to the implementation of the July version of the framework agreement, rather than start new negotiations. In a statement before the talks last Sunday, Netanyahu's office denied that new demands had been made, saying their position was based on a previous proposal. Bonus video:",

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.\nDuring a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\n\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"\nThe day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.\nHosek wouldn't hear of it.\n\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\"\n'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her\nCustomer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.\nNoticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\n\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.\nIn a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners.\nChappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\n\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"\nOwner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.\nThe \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.\nThe two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.\nChappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\n\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.\n1-cent Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's are available at Wendy's this week. Here's how to get one.

    "title": "'Hopefully He'll Be Back Here With Me:' Pat Freiermuth Wants Najee Harris To Re-Sign With Steelers",
    "text": "Coming into the league together in 2021, Pittsburgh Steelers TE Pat Freiermuth and RB Najee Harris have formed a close bond and emerged as team leaders. The two shared a moment after Pittsburgh’s playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens , in which they expressed disappointment that they weren’t able to win a playoff game together. Harris’ future is uncertain, as he’s a pending free agent. Speaking to the media on locker cleanout day on Monday, Freiermuth said he wants Harris to return to the Steelers.\n“Love seeing him in the Black and Gold, one of my best friends on the team. That’s what is upsetting, maybe not being able to be with a guy like that that I’ve been with for four years and trying to make the city proud and win a playoff game and win a Super Bowl and stuff. We weren’t able to get it done, but hopefully he’ll be back here with me, and all the guys, especially Dan [Moore Jr.] and stuff,” Freiermuth said via Steelers Live on Twitter .\nRussell Wilson and Pat Freiermuth spoke to the media today. @PondLehocky pic.twitter.com/5ifk04OSCE\n— Steelers Live (@SteelersLive) January 13, 2025\nHarris’ future in Pittsburgh looked uncertain at best after the team declined his fifth-year option last offseason. While he started the season strong, like the rest of the offense, Harris never really got going down the stretch. The run game struggled in the second half of the season, and Harris will likely make more money on the open market than he could in Pittsburgh.\nThe Steelers have Jaylen Warren ready to take on a bigger role, and the team will likely look to draft a running back as well. At this point, Harris coming back would be a surprise, but if he doesn’t get the offer he’s looking for as a free agent, it’s not out of the realm of possibility.\nIt’s tough for players to lose friends and teammates, and Dan Moore Jr. also came in with Freiermuth and Harris and is expected to leave as a free agent. These players learned the ropes and grew and matured together, but the NFL is a business, and players have to do what’s best for them and move on, even if it means leaving teammates with whom they’ve become close.\nIt’s a disappointing outcome for Najee Harris and Pat Freiermuth that they never tasted playoff success in Pittsburgh, and while they were a part of three playoff teams in their four years together, the Steelers were bounced in the Wild Card Round each year. With Freiermuth signing an extension ahead of the 2024 season, he at least will have more opportunities to get the playoff win that’s eluded Pittsburgh for the past eight years.",
