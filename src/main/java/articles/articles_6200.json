    "title": "Singapore Q4 job forecast: Several industries are hiring but one expects significant layoffs",
    "text": "ManpowerGroup (MPG) has released its quarterly employment report following its regular survey of 40,000 employers in 42 countries, including Singapore.\nGlobal findings aren’t our interest here and, thankfully, the city-state gets its own publication, which means we can take a deeper look into job market forecasts for the final quarter of 2024.\nThe survey divides industries into nine broad groups:\nTransport, Logistics and Automotive Healthcare and Life Sciences Industrials and Materials Consumer Goods and Services Energy and Utilities Information Technology Financials and Real Estate Communication Services Other, including: Government or Public Service; Not for Profit/NGO/Charity/Religious organization; Other Industry; Other Transport, Logistics and Automobiles Sub-Industry; Educational Institutions; Agriculture and Fishing General employment sentiments in Singapore MPG’s basic metric is the Net Employment Outlook, which is calculated by subtracting the number of employers expecting a decrease in hiring from those who predict an increase.\nThe figure for Singapore this quarter is 29 per cent, as nearly half of the polled companies across the economy anticipate increased hiring by the end of 2024, while only 17 per cent are bracing for cuts.\nImage Credit: ManpowerGroup This figure is higher than the last quarter, but lower than the same period last year. However, comparing figures with 2022 and 2023 may not be very relevant, as those two years saw a rebound in hiring following the COVID-19 isolation, so employer sentiments may have naturally been elevated.\nAs we’re settling into post-pandemic normalcy, it’s expected that more companies are reaching full employment and will not be looking for talent quite so actively as before.\nImage Credit: ManpowerGroup However, while the broad average looks good, there is considerably more variation depending on the company size.\nVery nearly no small businesses (under 50 people) are planning to hire, compared to about 50 per cent and more for bigger businesses, between 50 and 5,000.\nThis is good news for those in corporations, which are larger in size, but not so good for those relying on SME employment, which also tends to be represented by local entrepreneurs (as opposed to larger multinationals).\nAnd while we would need more data, it may mean that those in a better paid line of work are at a considerable advantage over those that are struggling to make ends meet.\nEmployment outlook by industry Finally, let’s take a look at the industry level data. The Financial & Real Estate sector has recorded a massive 49 per cent jump over Q3.\nHowever, by comparing the findings with other surveys, this figure is likely driven predominantly by the finance sector and far less by real estate, which—when analysed separately—tended to rank last.\nPerhaps ManpowerGroup can reconsider the grouping and unscramble both industries as they do not necessarily align with each other.\nAnother bit of good news is the fact that nearly all sectors are looking to increase their headcounts.\nIn previous releases, scoring 30 per cent or more was a great result, but now nearly all (except two) are either above or near this level.\nThere is one outlier however, and that is the Energy and Utilities sector, with a depressing -30 per cent. This means that, on the whole, 30 per cent more companies in the industry are looking to cut staffing in Q4 than those willing to hire.\nIt’s a precipitous drop from +20 per cent last quarter and +28 last year, and was recorded despite the fact that 69 per cent of employers are still complaining about talent shortages.\nIn practical terms, it may mean that as many as 40 to 50 per cent of businesses in this sector might be laying people off, assuming 10 or 20 per cent are willing to employ (MPG does not provide a specific breakdown).\nIf you’re in Energy & Utilities, keep your ear to the ground for the next three months, just to be safe. Fortunately, everybody else shouldn’t have to worry about a spoilt New Year’s Eve.\nFind out more about MPG’s quarterly employment report here .

    "text": "Milano, 9 mar. (askanews) - \"Siamo ebrei e palestinesi, russi e ucraini. L'umanità non ha confini\". Con questo slogan scandito da centinaia di persone, è partita la manifestazione nazionale a Roma per la pace e il diritto di manifestare, organizzata dalla coalizione Assisi Pace Giusta, che riunisce diverse associazioni e reti, di cui fa parte anche la Cgil, in piazza con il segretario generale Maurizio Landini: \"Quello che sta facendo Netanyahu è un danno anche per il popolo israeliano. Due popoli e due Stati è la battaglia fondamentale ma oggi va impedito che inermi palestinesi, bambini, continuino a morire. Questa è una follia e va assolutamente bloccata\"Presente anche una delegazione dell'Anpi e una di Emergency con la presidente Rossella Miccio che ricorda Gino Strada: \"Ci penso spesso a come vivrebbe questa cosa Gino Strada. Sarebbe arrabbiatissimo, lo siamo tutti noi e proprio per questo siamo qui oggi a gridare cessate il fuoco\".Tanti gli esponenti politici presenti alla manifestazione, da Nicola Fratoianni ad Angelo Bonelli di Avs. Presente anche l'ex governatore pugliese Nichi Vendola: \"Credo nella necessità di una mobilitazione internazionale e anche nello scuotimento dei governi dell'occidente che si beano della condizione di essere portatori dell'ideologia del bene e sono vergognosamente complici della infinita carneficina ai danni dei palestinesi\".Tra gli striscioni: \"Stop al genocidio, voi i manganelli noi la pace\", mentre poco più in avanti la Cgil spiega \"i manganelli sono un fallimento, libertà di espressione e di manifestazione\".",

    "text": "Throughout her career, Naomi Raine has curated Christian music that appeals to broad audiences, fusing traditional\ngospel with R&B, pop, and hip-hop elements. Her recent project, The Gift, gives listeners a blend of the holiday spirit while refocusing it on the spirit of God and the blessings that he continues to provide.\nRaine spoke with rolling out, sending a message to those in need of prayer, and how she would introduce someone to God heading into the new year.\nCan you speak to those grieving during this time of the year?\nI encourage those people to remember that you’re never alone. I think there’s a lie that the enemy can sometimes tell us that we’re alone and that because we may have lost something, all hope is lost. My prayer is for you to find the joy, the silver lining, and even old memories. If you’ve lost a loved one, my prayer is that you feel the loss because I think that there’s this health to that, and it makes sense. The right response to loss is grief, but my prayer is that there would be an opening for joy for you to remember the good. For those who are feeling isolated or lonely, or maybe you’ve chosen to get away from people and family and things that are not safe for you right now, my prayer is that you will find community and joy and love and laughter in the new year, but beyond that, my prayer is that the Holy Spirit would comfort and that he would guide our hearts and minds into peace. That’s the promise that Jesus affords us.\nHow would you introduce someone to God going into 2024?\nI think most people know that there’s something bigger, whether we’ve accepted it or not. My introduction of God to this person would be I want them to look around and look at creation, look at the sun, the moon, the stars, what has been created and set in order, and there’s an order to the world, to the earth, and there’s a way that things work. There’s a level of chaos in the world with people when we come away from his natural order, so I would want to invite them into a level of curiosity, and a level of wonder, and invite you into asking questions and asking God, “If He exists, show me a sign. Speak to me.” I believe in encounters and moments like that, because I believe that God wants to speak to us and wants to encounter us even more than we want to encounter Him. I think He desires for us to know Him, and to walk with Him, and I think that he responds when we reach out and when we ask.",

    "text": "Un análisis de semen puede mejorar la detección del cáncer de próstata\n[Eva Salabert](https://www.webconsultas.com/autores/eva-salabert)\n07/11/2024\nEl [cáncer de próstata](https://www.webconsultas.com/cancer-de-prostata/cancer-de-prostata-1954) es el segundo tipo de cáncer más común en los hombres y se estima que en nuestro país se diagnosticarán 30.316 nuevos casos hasta finales de este año, según el informe [‘Las cifras del cáncer en España 2024’](https://www.seom.org/images/LAS_CIFRAS_2024.pdf). Esta enfermedad tiene unas elevadas tasas de curación si se detecta precozmente, y en la actualidad su diagnóstico se basa fundamentalmente en el examen rectal digital y la [medición de los niveles de PSA (antígeno prostático específico) en sangre](https://www.webconsultas.com/pruebas-medicas/analisis-del-psa-12245).\nLos niveles elevados de PSA suelen estar relacionados con un mayor riesgo de padecer este tumor y desde que se implementó este método de detección, la mortalidad por cáncer de próstata ha disminuido significativamente. Sin embargo, esta prueba presenta ciertas limitaciones, ya que en muchos casos el aumento de PSA puede estar asociado a otras afecciones de la próstata, como infecciones, inflamación o [hiperplasia benigna](https://www.webconsultas.com/salud-al-dia/hiperplasia-benigna-de-prostata/hiperplasia-benigna-de-prostata-13996), lo cual lleva a un sobrediagnóstico del cáncer y a la realización de biopsias innecesarias.\nAdemás, los niveles de PSA no están relacionados con la agresividad del tumor, la supervivencia o la respuesta a los tratamientos, lo que conduce a un exceso de tratamientos para tumores no agresivos. Por ello, es necesario desarrollar biomarcadores no invasivos más precisos que complementen y mejoren el actual método de cribado de cáncer de próstata. Ahora, un nuevo estudio liderado por investigadores del [Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)](https://idibell.cat/es/2024/10/identifican-biomarcadores-en-muestras-de-semen-que-podrian-reducir-el-sobrediagnostico-en-el-cribado-de-cancer-de-prostata/) ha identificado biomarcadores que podrían mejorar la detección no invasiva de los casos de cáncer de próstata clínicamente relevantes.\nUn método eficaz y no invasivo para detectar tumores de próstata\nEstudios previos han demostrado que en los tumores de próstata hay una alteración significativa en los niveles de ciertos RNA pequeños no codificantes (sncRNAs), que, aunque no generan proteínas, regulan la expresión genética. Entre estos se destacan los miRNAs y los tsRNAs, con un gran potencial como biomarcadores para el cáncer de próstata, y los investigadores del IDIBELL han confirmado la utilidad de los tsRNAs presentes en el semen como biomarcadores para este tipo de cáncer.\n“En estudios anteriores habíamos desarrollado test basados en los niveles de miRNAs en semen útiles como biomarcadores para cáncer de próstata; ahora evidenciamos que los niveles alterados de tsRNAs en el tumor también se pueden detectar y cuantificar en estas muestras de semen”, afirma en una nota publicada por IDIBELL la Dra. Sara Larriba, investigadora principal en genética molecular de la infertilidad masculina y enfermedades urogenitales en el IDIBELL y líder del estudio, en el que han colaborado el Servicio de Urología del [Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge](https://bellvitgehospital.cat/es/actualidad/noticia/biomarcadores-en-muestras-de-semen-podrian-ayudar-reducir-el-sobrediagnostico-en), el Servicio de Andrología de la Fundación Puigvert y la Unidad de Genómica de Alto Contenido y Bioinformática del IGTP.\n“Creemos que los modelos obtenidos basados en tsRNAs en semen como biomarcadores no invasivos mejorarían el diagnóstico del cáncer de próstata al combinarse con los análisis de PSA”\nLos autores del estudio, cuyos resultados se han publicado en [International Journal of Molecular Sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/10122), consideran que el semen es una fuente de información no solo para evaluar la fertilidad masculina, sino también para identificar patologías que afectan a otros órganos del aparato reproductor, como la próstata.\nPara este análisis, Adriana Ferre-Giraldo, investigadora del IDIBELL y primera autora del estudio, explica que “a partir de estudios de secuenciación a gran escala, seleccionamos diferentes tsRNAs candidatos que pudieran reflejar la salud de la glándula prostática para después validarlos en semen. Creemos que los modelos obtenidos basados en tsRNAs en semen como biomarcadores no invasivos mejorarían el diagnóstico clínico del cáncer de próstata al combinarlo con los análisis de PSA”.\nLa combinación de ambos análisis podría representar un enfoque más efectivo para la detección no invasiva del cáncer de próstata, complementando las herramientas diagnósticas disponibles e identificando únicamente los casos clínicamente significativos y evitando el sobrediagnóstico y las biopsias innecesarias. Además, la implementación de estos biomarcadores permitiría hacer un pronóstico más preciso de la enfermedad, diferenciando entre tumores indolentes y agresivos con mayor seguridad.\nFuente: Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)\nActualizado: 7 de noviembre de 2024",

    "text": "Cyberwarfare / Nation-State Attacks , Fraud Management & Cybercrime Renewed Info Stealer Campaign Targets Ukrainian MilitaryCERT-UA Says Threat Actor 'Vermin' Used Syncthing Application Ukrainian cyber defenders said Russian intelligence hackers operating from the occupied Donbas city of Luhansk targeted military email inboxes with an info stealer. See Also: Check Kiting In The Digital Age The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine on Thursday said a group it tracks as UAC-0020 - also known as \"Vermin\" - deployed a malware strain dubbed \"Spectr\" as part of a spear-phishing campaign. The phishing email appears to contain password-protected information about a gun turret. An attachment contains an archive folder with three files: a decoy PDF, an executable file and a batch file. The executable contains Spectr malware bundled with a modified version of Syncthing, a legitimate open-source, peer-to-peer synchronization application. The hackers made modifications that included disabling the user notifications of Syncthing. The malware steals documents, files, passwords and other information - including data from the victims' Telegram, Signal and Skype accounts - from the infected device while operating in the background. The info stealer copies the exfiltrated data into a subfolder and transfers it using the file-sharing app. CERT-UA called the campaign \"no-so-successful,\" dubbing it \"SIckSync.\" Ukraine said Vermin is an operation of Luhansk law enforcement agencies. That region of Ukraine operated with the support of Russian-backed paramilitaries as a breakaway state from 2014 until 2022, when Russia putatively annexed it. Vermin's last known operation was in March 2022, when Ukrainian cyber defenders https://cert.gov.ua/article/37815 they detected a similar campaign deploying Spectr malware. The Russia-Ukraine war is now in its third year. Russia in May opened a new battlefront in the Kharkiv region, and the Institute for the Study of War https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-5-2024 on Wednesday that \"Russian forces are attempting to make tactically and operationally significant gains\" before renewed U.S. military assistance arrives at the front line at scale. U.S. President Joe Biden in May approved Ukrainian use of artillery to strike Russian forces in Russia. The New York Times reported Wednesday that a Ukrainian member of parliament said armed forces used that permission to destroy Russian missile launchers in the Belgorod region using an American High Mobility Artillery Rocket System.",

    "text": "Le mariage homosexuel est une «pratique abominable», et les couples gays sont à «lapider» car ils ont «choisi le diable» et attirent la «malédiction» divine: le président burundais Evariste Ndayishimiye s’est livré vendredi à une virulente diatribe contre l’homosexualité.\nLe chef de l’État de ce pays de l’Afrique des Grands Lacs chrétien et conservateur, où les relations entre personnes de même sexe sont sanctionnées de peines allant jusqu’à 2 ans de prison, s’exprimait lors d’une conférence publique dans la province de Cankuzo (est) retransmise à la radio et à télévision, répondant aux questions de la presse et de la population.\n«Vous m’avez posé une question sur cette pratique abominable qui fait qu’un homme se marie avec un autre homme et une femme avec une autre femme», a-t-il déclaré, avant d’évoquer la Bible. «Je vous dis la vérité, si vous voulez attirer la malédiction sur un pays, il faut laisser les gens de même sexe se marier. Vous vous souvenez de ce qui est arrivé à Sodome et Gomorrhe? Dieu en est arrivé alors à dire: «Je regrette d’avoir créé l’homme», a-t-il ajouté.\n«On devrait les mettre dans un stade» «Personnellement, je pense que si on voit ce genre d’individus au Burundi, on devrait les mettre dans un stade et les lapider avec des pierres. Et ce ne serait pas un péché pour ceux qui le feront!» a estimé Evariste Ndayishimiye, qui avait déjà appelé cette année à «bannir» les homosexuels et à les «traiter en parias». Il s’en est également pris aux pays occidentaux, qui affichent régulièrement leur opposition aux violations des droits de la communauté LGBTQ+.\nEn Ouganda, autre pays d’Afrique de l’Est, une loi votée en mai par le parlement réprimant sévèrement les pratiques homosexuelles et la «promotion de l’homosexualité» a suscité de vives condamnations occidentales et des sanctions des États-Unis.\n«Vous avez dit que les pays occidentaux tentent de forcer les petits pays pour qu’ils adoptent cette pratique, et qu’ils ne recevront aucune aide s’ils ne s’y conforment pas. Qu’ils gardent leur aide, qu’ils la gardent!» a lancé le président ougandais. «Celui qui a choisi le diable, qu’il aille vivre dans ces pays. D’ailleurs, je crois que ceux qui s’exilent dans ces pays y vont pour adopter ces pratiques (…) Qu’ils ne reviennent plus », a-t-il également fustigé.\nL’homosexualité encore très taboue en Afrique de l’Est Le Code pénal burundais réprime les relations homosexuelles, passibles d’amendes et de peines allant de 3 mois à 2 ans de prison. En mars, 24 personnes avaient été accusées de «pratiques homosexuelles ou incitation aux pratiques homosexuelles» et écrouées. Sept d’entre elles ont été condamnées, cinq à 2 ans de prison ferme et deux autres à 1 an de prison.\nEn Afrique de l’Est comme dans de nombreux pays du continent, les personnes LGBTQ+ subissent stigmatisation et discriminations dans des sociétés conservatrices, qu’elles soient majoritairement chrétiennes ou musulmanes, où l’homosexualité est taboue.\n(AFP)",
