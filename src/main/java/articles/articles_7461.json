    "title": "B.C. odour incidents spark questions around corporate ethics and communication",
    "text": "Vancouver resident Robert Ford was heading to a yoga class Sunday morning when he smelled an odour he likened to \"semi-burnt fuel.\"\nAs a member of council at his Kitsilano apartment building, he said he decided to check the boiler room, but it smelled fine.\n\"I was expecting something in there, so that was strange. I scratched my head and I went to the front door, which is right across from the beach, and it was 10 times more powerful outside,\" he said.\nHe immediately began searching online for an explanation but didn't find any answers until almost four hours later.\n\"I'm just kind of perplexed at how we can have such a nasty event with no public information hardly,\" he said.\nIt was one of two acrid odours that spread over parts of Metro Vancouver in less than a week, raising questions about corporate responsibility to inform the public when such events cause widespread concern and confusion but fall short of health and safety breaches.\nThe smell Ford referred to was revealed to be \"an unplanned issue\" with a Parkland fuel refinery processing unit in neighbouring Burnaby. The heavy stench, which Ford compared to jet fuel, blanketed parts of Metro Vancouver and caused more than 100 complaints from local residents.\nIt came just days after a gas leak from a FortisBC natural gas plant in nearby Delta, B.C., prompted criticisms from Mayor George Harvie and numerous residents that the utility didn't notify the public for more than four hours.\nHarvie said the heavy odour caused stress and panic in the community, and a flood of calls to local police and fire departments hampered Delta's emergency response services.\nA statement from Fortis said it was investigating after an elevated level of the odorant added to natural gas was unknowingly sent out in a controlled release of gas.\nCarol Liao, a University of B.C. Sauder fellow at the Dhillon centre for business ethics, said these incidents are not necessarily matters for legislation, but rather about accountability and ethics.\n\"Businesses obviously need to obey bylaws, but they also need to understand that beyond that, there is a need to act responsibly to maintain public trust,\" she said.\n\"If a business is the cause of a terrible odour that's impacting the surrounding community and beyond, it should act as a good corporate citizen and own up to the problem right away, alert public officials, alert those possibly impacted and in harm's way, mitigate the damage and be accountable.\"\nHarvie said he was involved in both incidents as Delta's mayor and as chair of Metro Vancouver's regional district.\n\"The difference between the two was (in) Metro Vancouver, air quality inspectors were on scene at the refinery, so we had more accurate information being fed back to us,\" he said.\nMetro Vancouver monitors emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide from the Parkland refinery, and the district has said air quality objectives for the contaminants weren't exceeded Sunday.\nBut, Harvie said the Fortis incident was different.\n\"The one from Fortis was very disturbing to me and it does speak a lot about corporate values (and) corporate responsibilities. They kept the information away from us,\" he said. \"This was just unacceptable.\"\nHarvie took to the social media site X after the smell covered an area stretching from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to more than 30 kilometres away in Vancouver. The mayor said he had contacted FortisBC requesting an urgent followup meeting.\nThe Fortis statement released on Wednesday said work was being performed on new equipment, which was not connected to the gas system, and while a controlled release of gas was planned, the release of odour was not.\n\"Further review is underway to determine why there was an elevated level of odorant in the equipment,\" it said.\n\"Although the controlled release of gas at the interconnect station on Jan. 16 contained an elevated level of this odorant, it is not harmful and there are no immediate or long-term health effects.\"\nFortis said it had been in contact with local First Nations, municipal and emergency officials, including Harvie, as well as government regulators, to provide information on its response.\n\"We have also started a review of the incident and are working with relevant stakeholders during this process.\"\nKevin Farrow, technical director of Parkland, said in an interview that the refinery had paused processing operations earlier this month due to extreme cold weather.\n\"It was during that restart of the refinery, that one of the processing units had a plugged line, which ultimately led to the plume and odour that many experienced on Sunday,\" he said. \"We've launched a review to better understand the root cause of what happened and how we got into this situation.\"\nParkland had issued an advisory on its website two days before the plume, alerting people who live nearby that they may notice noise and \"higher than usual flare\" from the facility.\nIn a timeline created by the refinery and sent to The Canadian Press, the company said the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. Sunday.\nIt said Metro Vancouver had been notified by 8:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m., the Burnaby Fire Department and the RCMP had created a perimeter around the facility as a safety precaution. The RCMP was called off at 11:26 a.m., while the fire department remained in place until 3:15 p.m., the timeline said.\nThe refinery's first public statement Sunday was issued at 11 a.m., notifying the public of an incident that cause elevated smoke, odours and particulate matter. That was followed up at 12:30 p.m. with a media advisory, announcing the shut down of operations.\nWhile some, including Ford in Kitsilano, believe communication needs to come sooner to alleviate panic, Farrow said the \"priority\" of the refinery is to \"communicate accurate and confirmed information to the public.\"\n\"We have that information now,\" he said. \"We understand more, and we've begun to reach out to our community partners and to our neighbours, (and) you can expect a lot more information from the refinery in the coming days and weeks.\"\nFarrow noted the refinery remains shut down but the company announced it would be conducting a \"controlled and necessary operational procedure\" on Thursday.\n\"We do not expect any impacts of the community. We're just making them aware, just in case anything were to occur,\" Farrow said.\nMetro Vancouver also issued an updated air quality bulletin Wednesday night, saying it \"will be closely monitoring\" as the refinery conducts the operation \"that may result in odour, smoke and flaring.\"\nWhile some residents expressed concern about the announcement online, Liao applauded the move, saying an advanced public statement can be \"immensely helpful in ensuring transparency and accountability to the surrounding communities.\"\n\"It helps avoid any public confusion and the tying up of resources such as 911 calls, while also mitigating risk,\" she said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nLieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Have you ever come across a woman wearing a tichel (headscarf) on her head making havdalah, standing next to a woman wearing a kippah and tzitzit? If you have, you have probably been on [Limmud](https://www.thejc.com/tag/Limmud). I think that it is safe to say that apart from the recent solidarity rallies that brought together Jews of all stripes, Limmud is the only place in the UK where you will find this extraordinary diversity of Jewish practice and belief. The only thing that everyone needs to agree on is a willingness to open your mind to learning and your heart to people who may look at Judaism — and life — through a different lens to you. Having been to Limmud only once before, some 20 years ago, when the opportunity came to return, I wouldn’t say that I jumped at it — it runs over 25 December, and I am partial to a slice of turkey and a few words from royalty — but my curiosity was certainly piqued. When my husband suggested we took our two teenagers along, and it was in a hotel, it almost sounded like a family holiday — just with 1,600 other people. If we are going to use an analogy for Limmud, the closest would be a cross between Club Med and a kibbutz, minus the snow and the sun. For five days, the Hilton in Birmingham was transformed into a Jewish bubble, and in true Club Med style, you never quite knew who would sit down next to you at dinner. There was also entertainment on tap, which came in the form of talks, discussions, study sessions, workshops and shows on top. The diversity of the participants was matched by the diversity of the programme. It wasn’t always easy being the sole JC journalist present, and there were many times when I wished I could have split myself in two — or even five. Perhaps it would have helped if I had gone to the session on Judaism and AI. — Limmud (@limmud) [#Limmud]’s youngest ever participant, Ella Lawton (9 days old) meets [#LimmudFestival23]’s oldest participant, Ruth Shire (102) [#intergenerational] [pic.twitter.com/AugIrnQetI] [December 24, 2023] But then I would have missed out on the session on the Jewish responses to Darwinism or Charedinomics 101 or Mindfulness or Beit Midrash: Talmud for All or … Tilla Crowne, who has been attending Limmud since 2010 and who led a session on mushroom foraging, told me: “It’s a bit like the Edinburgh fringe here. Some of the sessions sound amazing, but can be disappointing; some don’t sound amazing, but can be life-changing. This year’s programme was really strong, and it was fabulous to be with so many thinking, engaged and lovely Jewish people in this space.” The intergenerational aspect is a Limmud USP, and this year’s participants boasted the biggest-ever age-range, from 102 all the way down to nine days old. This year saw the festival’s first baby-naming over Shabbat. Mum Anna Lawton, daughter of Clive Lawton, a Limmud founder, has been coming since she herself was a baby, going on to chair it in 2015. She said that bringing along her newborn Ella with her two older children was “in some ways easier than being at home”, adding: “Yes, I still had the sleeplessness, but the kids have been occupied and all the food has been cooked for us. It also feels really lovely, especially this year, to be in a space of Jewish solidarity, with all the diversity and disagreement that comes with that.” Taking place in the shadow of October 7, this year’s festival was going to be a different festival to previous ones and the organisers adjusted the programme to reflect that. — Limmud (@limmud) [#LimmudFestival23]brought in Shabbat with [@Andy4wm]Mayor of the West Midlands. He welcomed volunteers, trustees and attendees to Birmingham and spoke of the “dignity, moderation, tolerance, and respect” amongst faith communities in the West Midlands. [pic.twitter.com/3GMxzdmP41] [December 24, 2023] I attended For the Sake of Argument, a Limmud staple on how to have a “healthy argument”, run by Abi Dauber Sterne and Robbie Gringras. They had added a session called Should/How/Can we talk about the war?, which should be compulsory education, not just in schools and workplaces, but for everyone. Reflecting on the past nine months, when she first put her committee together, Limmud Festival chair Hannah Gaventa said: “I am very proud of the team, the programme track chairs and the contractors we have worked with.” She spent “quite a lot of the festival thanking people”, by handing out mini pots of hot chocolates and, on Christmas Day, kosher mince pies, which her mum had made. A highlight was running the first-ever carbon-neutral festival, dubbed EcoLimmud. “I do humanitarian work and have seen how devastated a community is when a volcano erupts, so I was keen for us to be aware of our climate.” After October 7, she said they had made sure to include more Israeli voices and at least one Israel-themed session in every slot. “Lots of Israelis told me that Limmud had been a really good place to feel part of a global community, to breathe and find Jewish joy again.” They weren’t the only ones who felt that way.",

El juez central caleño Jhon Alexander Ospina tuvo protagonismo en el duelo entre São Paulo de Brasil y Nacional de Uruguay, válido por la vuelta de los octavos de final del certamen continental, en su edición del 2024.\nOspina fue el árbitro designado para el compromiso entre brasileños y charrúas que, más allá del ámbito futbolístico, estuvo marcado por dos situaciones puntuales que generaron tensión y preocupación entre los asistentes al estadio Morumbi, uno de los más icónicos del fútbol sudamericano.\nAhora puede seguirnos en nuestro WhatsApp Channel y en Facebook .\nTras el 0-0 en la ida disputada en Montevideo días atrás, el conjunto brasileño se fue adelante en el marcador con un gol de Damián Bobadilla, que dejaba la serie a favor de los locales de forma momentánea.\nHasta ahí, el réferi colombiano no afrontó mayores complicaciones. Más allá de un par de amonestaciones, Ospina no protagonizó encontrones de ningún tipo con alguno de los 22 jugadores que estaban en campo . Pero lo peor estaba por venir.\nJhon Ospina fue el árbitro del partido de vuelta de los octavos de final de la Copa Libertadores entre Sao Paulo y Nacional - crédito Colprensa Los dolores de cabeza de Jhon Ospina en el juego entre São Paulo y Nacional Con el inicio de la segunda mitad, Jonathan Calleri estampó el 2-0 final, lo que generó que, con el calor del partido, hinchas del cuadro charrúa protagonizaran desmanes en la tribuna que les fue designada. Algunos fanáticos lanzaron algunas sillas sobre seguidores del cuadro local, lo que generó que la fuerza policial brasileña ingresara en esa gradería y protagonizara múltiples enfrentamientos.\nLa situación obligó al colombiano a detener el partido por algunos minutos, mientras que las autoridades intentaban contener lo que sucedía.\nHinchas de Nacional protagonizaron desmanes en el estadio Morumbi - crédito Carla Carniel/ REUTERS Así las cosas, momentos después, Ospina decidió reanudar el partido, mientras que Diego Herazo, delantero colombiano de Nacional, ex Deportes Tolima , ingresó al partido. El duelo continuó con normalidad, pero, casi sobre el final del partido, una situación causó pánico entre los futbolistas que permanecían en el terreno de juego.\nY es que sobre el 83′, Juan Izquierdo, uno de los defensores centrales del cuadro charrúa que había ingresado en el entretiempo, se desvaneció y quedó tendido en la mitad del terreno de juego.\nJuan Izquierdo se desvaneció sobre el 83' - crédito Carla Carniel/ REUTERS De inmediato, tanto jugadores de Nacional como de São Paulo intentaron socorrerlo, mientras que integrantes del cuerpo médico del conjunto visitante ingresaron corriendo a la cancha. Segundos más tarde, una ambulancia llegó hasta la zona donde permanecía el futbolista, a pocos metros de donde también estaba Ospina, que vigilaba la situación de manera atenta.\nLa situación causó desespero entre algunos jugadores, que no ocultaban su preocupación por el estado de salud de su colega. Sin embargo, pocos minutos después, el vehículo de asistencia partió rumbo a un centro médico.\nJuan Izquierdo se desvaneció sobre el terreno de juego - crédito Fox Sports Ante ello, Ospina optó por continuar el partido con normalidad y añadió 10 minutos, con lo que compensó así las pausas por los desmanes, así como por lo que, por ahora, algunos calificaron como un “desmayo”.\n¿Qué se sabe de Juan Izquierdo? Es importante indicar que, pasadas las 8:30 p. m. del jueves 22 de agosto, en territorio nacional, la radio Sport 890 de Montevideo había informado que el estado de salud del futbolista era delicado y que, incluso, el futbolista permanecía intubado y en terapia intensiva en un hospital de São Paulo.\nPor otra parte, tras su victoria frente a Nacional, el conjunto brasileño, que ya no cuenta en sus filas con el volante colombiano James Rodríguez, se aseguró un lugar en los cuartos de final de la Copa Libertadores : instancia en la que se medirá con Botafogo, otro club brasileño, que eliminó al Palmeiras de Richard Ríos.\nAsí mismo, además de la eliminación, Nacional quedó sin la posibilidad de competir por un lugar en el Supermundial de Clubes de 2025 que se disputará en Estados Unidos. Tras su derrota, también se confirmó que Boca Juniors de Argentina, que estaba a la expectativa, se clasificó para el certamen gracias a su puntaje histórico en la Conmebol.",
