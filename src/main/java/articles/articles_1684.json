    "title": "Tuco Marine: Words from the CEO 2023",
    "text": "As we approach the end of 2023, I would like to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and share some reflections on our journey together in 2023. This year not only marks the conclusion of 2023 but also commemorates our 25th anniversary. It has been an incredible journey, and we are immensely proud to have reached this milestone with the support of our dedicated team.\nTo celebrate this significant occasion, we recently held a grand jubilee celebration, honoring the dedication and hard work of our exceptional employees. This festive event brought us all together in the spirit of gratitude and camaraderie, reaffirming our commitment to excellence and innovation in the maritime industry.\nI want to thank clients, employees, suppliers and partners, for your unwavering support throughout the year. Your trust in Tuco Marine Group is the driving force behind our success, and we are truly honored to have you as part of our extended family.\nThe geopolitical landscape has presented us with various hurdles, from the ongoing situation in Ukraine to rising energy concerns, high interest rates, and escalating health challenges. Despite these external challenges, we have continued to persevere and thrive in the face of adversity.\nArtemis Technologies Pioneer\nA year of technology Focus\n2023 has been marked by our unwavering focus on technology. Our collaboration with Artemis Technologies and their groundbreaking eFoiler technology has led to the launch of the world’s first high-speed, 100% electric foil-assisted commercial workboats based on our proven ProZero workboat platform. These vessels are designed and built to the highest commercial standards, delivering industry-leading electric propulsion, superior maneuverability, and energy efficiency, even in the harshest environments. In 2023, we were thrilled to introduce a 12-passenger version with a full-beam cabin, expanding our offerings to cater to a wider range of needs.\nUnmanned Surface Vessels\nThe year has also witnessed a significant acceleration in our production of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Our ProZero USVs have garnered attention from major players in the USV industry, showcasing their capabilities in data collection.\nOur Enduruns 8m USV, equipped with hydrogen PEM fuel cell technology and advanced launch and recovery equipment, has undergone successful testing in Klaipeda and Venedi as part of the Enduruns project, funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 program.\nFurthermore, our 8m Met-Ocean Methodology USV has proven its capacity for genuine offshore data collection in some of the most challenging areas of the North Sea. And have been showcased for such by our esteemed clients.\nWe’re also proud to announce the launch and recognition of our 10m USV platform by Bureau Veritas, offering even greater payload capacity and extended range compared to our 8m versions.\nIn the defense sector, the demand for unmanned technology continues to grow, and our ProZero USV series is finding new applications and opportunities.\nFuel cell technology\nAs we focus on finding alternative power solutions for the maritime industry, fuel cell technology stands out as a promising candidate. Our collaboration with Blue World Technologies in the Blue Dolphin project, where we install and test a methanol fuel cell in our 11m Torqeedo electric-powered ProZero workboat, is a significant step towards a more sustainable future.\nNew Markets\nExpanding into new markets has also been a priority in 2023, with a particular emphasis on cold climate areas. We have invested heavily in research and development to enhance the operational capabilities of our ProZero Workboats in cold climates. This effort has led to increased sales in the Arctic region, and we have introduced new products tailored to these demanding environments.\nIn conclusion, 2023 has been a year of growth, innovation, and collaboration. We have welcomed new partners, such as Jurgen Vater, representing ProZero in Sweden, and strengthened our international ProZero Workboat partner network. Collaborative partnerships and local content agreements worldwide continue to be a cornerstone of our ProZero strategy, maximizing local input into design development and technology transfer to our partners across the globe.\nAs we bid farewell to this remarkable year, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our loyal customers, dedicated employees, and valued partners. Your unwavering support has been the driving force behind our achievements, and we are excited to embark on the journey that lies ahead in the new year.\nSource: Tuco Marine Group\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: A new study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, has revealed a 15-26% drop in PM2.5, or extremely small, respirable pollutant particles, at three clusters in the city by tackling dispersed air pollution sources in the city. Dispersed sources of pollution, including unpaved roads, illegal dumping of construction waste, garbage burning, and broken footpaths, are major causes of air pollution.The IIT-D study, titled ‘The Impact of the Dispersed Sources Programme on Local Air Quality', evaluated the impact of the dispersed sources on reducing PM2.5 locally. Under the guidance of Commission for Air Quality Management, A-PAG (Air Pollution Action Group), a foundation roped in by CAQM to work on dispersed sources of pollution, ran a programme in partnership with urban local bodies. It focused on identifying and resolving civic issues, both short-term such as illegally dumped garbage and debris on public land, and long-term like potholes, unpaved roads and broken footpaths.113922730To evaluate the impact of the programme on the ground, 35 portable low-cost sensors were deployed after thorough calibration in Jahangirpuri, Rohini, and Karol Bagh, all of which already had an existing continuous ambient air quality monitoring station. The analysis is based on data on the 65 long-term issues that were resolved and which were within the vicinity of the sensors. IIT-D, which used data from the nearest continuous air monitoring stations and portable low-cost sensors, found a decline in PM2.5 levels in these three clusters, reducing by 26.6% in Jahangirpuri, 15.7% in Rohini and 15.3% in Karol Bagh.Sagnik Dey, professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-D who led the study, said that for the first time, portable low-cost sensors had been effectively deployed to accurately quantify and demonstrate the potential impact of targeted interventions. \\\"The substantial reductions in PM2.5 levels locally are promising and underscore the efficacy of this data-driven approach,\\\" said Dey. \\\"Our research provides robust evidence that addressing both short-term and long-term pollution sources can yield substantial and sustained improvements in air quality.\\\" Tariq Thomas, additional commissioner, MCD, said at an event in IIT-Delhi, \\\"The study highlights the success of MCD and A-PAG's collaborative efforts, showcasing how targeted interventions can lead to notable air quality improvements in the city.\\\" He added, \\\"MCD has implemented dust control measures, enhanced waste management systems and engaged with residents to create cleaner, healthier neighbourhoods.\\\"",

El atropello del adulto mayor quedó captado en video, el cual circula actualmente en redes sociales, y de acuerdo con medios locales, tanto la policía nacional de Ecuador como la Agencia Metropolitana de Tránsito ya investigan. En redes sociales también circula la descripción del vehículo, ya que hubo una testigo que intentó evitar que el conductor huyera y respondiera por atropellar al adulto mayor; familiares y ciudadanos exigen justicia. Adulto mayor es atropellado en Quito, Ecuador; conductor lo arrastra a la banqueta y huye La mañana del pasado viernes 7 de junio, un adulto mayor, identificado como Jorge de 89 años, fue atropellado mientras sacudía unas alfombras en la calle N76, de la colonia Rancho Bajo, en Quito, Ecuador. En el video se puede observar que el adulto mayor estaba sacudiendo una alfombra alrededor de las 8:00 horas, cuando el conductor, con su auto en reversa, lo atropelló y después se bajó del vehículo. Posteriormente, toma al adulto mayor y lo carga hasta la banqueta de dicha vialidad en Quito, Ecuador, sin verificar su estado tras haber sido atropellado; posteriormente toma la alfombra y se la avienta a los pies. Igualmente, se puede observar como personas se acercan al vehículo y al adulto mayor atropellado, siendo una mujer, identificada como Laura Quiroz, quien intentó detener al conductor, pero este arrancó y huyó del lugar. De acuerdo con lo señalado por dicha testigo, el conductor acudió a un mecánico de la calle N76, Quito, Ecuador, pero no recibió el servicio; posteriormente atropelló al adulto mayor. Familiares del adulto mayor lo trasladaron primeramente al Hospital Pablo Arturo Suárez, igualmente en Quito, Ecuador, después al sanatorio Eugenio Espejo, en donde permaneció en coma unas horas y posteriormente murió. Autoridades de Ecuador ya buscan a conductor que atropelló a adulto mayor en Quito Tal como señalan medios locales, el director de la Agencia Metropolitana de Tránsito, Washington Martínez, entregó a la Fiscalía General de Ecuador la información del vehículo que atropelló al adulto mayor. Además de que en coordinación con la Policía Nacional de Ecuador están trabajando para localizar el vehículo, un Sail AC 1.4. de color beige con placas PCM6636, que estaría a nombre de una mujer. Hasta el momento, las autoridades no han informado si tienen avances en la investigación o dicha mujer ya fue interrogada, sólo se conoce que estaban buscando al conductor que atropelló al adulto mayor. Igualmente especulan que se tipificará con base en el artículo 377 del Código Orgánico Integral de Penal (COIP) de Ecuador.",

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

La primera fue en Londres 2012 por 1-0 y la segunda en Río 2016 con una goleada por 4-0. La primera parte fue de dominio total de Francia, que aprovechó un error en cadena de la defensa colombiana para adelantarse en el marcador a los seis minutos con un gol de Katoto, que definió muy bien con un disparo bajo cruzado ante Katherine Tapia. La portera colombiana también fue protagonista en el segundo tanto de Francia, ya que un mal despeje suyo dejó el balón dentro del área a Kenza Dali, que se acomodó el esférico y sin oposición lanzó al fondo de las mallas. Antes del descanso, Francia amplió su ventaja con otro fallo defensivo de la defensa colombiana, que dejó a Katoto rematar de cabeza totalmente sola dentro del área un centro desde la izquierda. El descanso le vino bien a Colombia, que saltó al césped con nuevas ideas y mejoró mucho su juego. Fruto de esa mejoría consiguió recortar distancias tras una falta dentro del área sobre Mayra Ramírez que la colegiada decretó penalti. Catalina Usma, desde los once metros, no falló su disparo. Ese gol dio alas a la selección cafetera, que siguió ganando metros ante la confianza de las francesas, que no supieron frenar el vendaval de las visitantes, que marcaron el segundo por medio de Manuela Pavi en una jugada individual. Leicy Santos, tras ganar un balón en una jugada revuelta ante Wendy Renard y Griedge Mbock, se quedó sola ante Peyraud-Magnin, que vio como el balón se iba por encima del travesaño. Esa fue la ocasión más clara para empatar de Colombia, que vio frenadas sus ambiciones con la expulsión de Mayra Ramírez tras pisar el tobillo a una defensa francesa, una situación que dio un soplo de aire a las galas para celebrar el triunfo en su debut olímpico como anfitrionas.",

    "title": "La production de Boeing en partie paralysée par sa première grève depuis 2008 | RTL Info",
    "text": "Plusieurs dizaines de milliers d'ouvriers de Boeing ont lancé vendredi une grève sans précédent depuis seize ans, bloquant notamment la production dans son berceau de la côte nord-ouest américaine. L'arrêt de travail a débuté dans le sillage du rejet massif du projet de nouvelle convention collective, négocié depuis le 8 mars par Boeing et l'antenne locale du syndicat des machinistes (IAM-District 751) et qui devait succéder à celle datant de 2008 qui expirait jeudi à minuit.Les plus de 33.000 syndiqués de l'avionneur dans la région de Seattle - sur quelque 170.000 employés du groupe - ont rejeté l'accord annoncé le 8 septembre à 94,6% et approuvé un débrayage à 96%, selon Jon Holden, président de l'IAM-District 751.\"La grève commence à minuit\", a-t-il lancé lors d'un point de presse jeudi soir, au cours duquel il a annoncé un recours contre Boeing auprès de l'agence fédérale chargée du droit du travail (NRLB) pour pratiques déloyales pendant les négociations.La dernière grève chez l'avionneur américain, en 2008, avait duré 57 jours.Face au mécontentement des adhérents, M. Holden avait toutefois affirmé ne pouvoir \"garantir que nous obtiendrons davantage en faisant grève\".Ce mouvement social paralysait dès vendredi matin les deux grandes usines d'assemblage de Renton et d'Everett, qui produisent le 737 MAX - best-seller de Boeing -, le 777 et le 767 (version cargo et ravitailleur militaire), dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards.La production d'autres sites, notamment une usine de pièces détachées à Portland (Oregon) tout proche, étaient également à l'arrêt, tout comme le réusinage de dizaines de 787 Dreamliner effectué à Everett depuis plusieurs mois.En revanche, l'assemblage du Dreamliner n'était pas perturbée à ce stade car l'usine se trouve en Caroline du Sud (est) et n'est pas concernée par cette convention collective.- \"Chancelant\" -L'avionneur encaisse la plus grosse partie du paiement (environ 60%) à la remise des avions. Il peut livrer les avions ayant reçu le feu vert du régulateur FAA avant la grève mais son rythme de production fonctionne au ralenti depuis un incident en vol début janvier sur un 737 MAX 9 d'Alaska Airlines.\"Pour un Boeing financièrement chancelant, une grève est la dernière chose dont il avait besoin\", a relevé le site spécialisé dans l'aviation Leeham News,Selon les analystes de TD Cowen, une grève de 50 jours priverait Boeing de 3 à 3,5 milliards de dollars de liquidités et aurait un impact de 5,5 milliards sur le chiffre d'affaires.\"Le message selon lequel l'accord de principe conclu avec les dirigeants de l'IAM n'est pas acceptable pour ses membres est clair\", a réagi Boeing. \"Nous restons engagés à réinitialiser notre relation avec nos employés et avec le syndicat, et nous sommes prêts à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord\", a-t-il poursuivi.Une semaine après sa prise de fonction le 8 août, le nouveau patron de l'avionneur Kelly Ortberg s'était engagé à \"réinitialiser\" cette relation.Vers 14H00 GMT, l'action Boeing chutait de 2,66% à la Bourse de New York.La convention collective rejetée prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25% sur quatre ans, un engagement d'investissements dans la région, ainsi que la construction du prochain avion - annoncé pour 2035 - dans le berceau historique de l'avionneur, ce qui devait assurer des emplois pour plusieurs décennies.Boeing espérait que ces concessions suffiraient à esquiver une grève. Sa situation financière est précaire depuis le crash de deux 737 MAX 8 en 2018 et en 2019 (346 morts), et moult problèmes de qualité de la production.\"Ce n'est un secret pour personne: notre activité traverse une période difficile, en partie à cause de nos propres erreurs du passé. (...) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune\", avait prévenu mercredi soir M. Ortberg, exhortant les employés à ne pas \"sacrifier\" les progrès futurs en raison de \"frustrations liées au passé\".Mais les mécontents jugent la hausse salariale trop éloignée des demandes du syndicat (+40% initialement) et le volet sur les retraites insatisfaisant. \"On nous a bradés\", a lancé jeudi à l'AFP Kamie Bryan, employée chez Boeing depuis 18 ans.\"Ils parlent d'une augmentation de 25%, mais ce n'est pas le cas\", a déclaré Paul Janousek, estimant que la présentation par Boeing était \"trompeuse\". Selon cet électricien de 55 ans, dont treize chez Boeing, son augmentation n'atteindrait qu'environ 9% du fait de la suppression d'une prime annuelle.Selon le règlement de l'IAM, les grévistes recevront 250 dollars par semaine à partir de la troisième semaine d'arrêt de travail.",

    "title": "Parlamento Europeo reconoció a Edmundo González como presidente electo de Venezuela - El Diario",
    "text": "- La resolución fue aprobada con 309 votos a favor, 201 en contra y 12 abstenciones | Foto: José Daniel Ramos El Parlamento Europeo reconoció el jueves 19 de septiembre a Edmundo González como presidente legítimo y democráticamente elegido de Venezuela, en un texto no vinculante que se aprobó con los síes del Partido Popular Europeo, los ultraconservadores y la derecha. La resolución, aprobada con 309 votos a favor, 201 en contra y 12 abstenciones, [también reconoce a María Corina Machado](https://eldiario.com/2024/09/18/nominaron-maria-corina-machado-edmundo-gonzalez-premio-sajarov/) como líder de las fuerzas democráticas en Venezuela y reclama a la Unión Europea y a sus Estados miembros -quienes tienen la competencia en política exterior- que se unan en el reconocimiento a Edmundo González. No obstante, debido a una enmienda de socialdemócratas, liberales y verdes, el texto no llega a reclamar a la Unión Europea y a sus Estados miembros -quienes tienen la competencia en política exterior- que se unan en el reconocimiento a González. Es la primera ocasión de la actual legislatura en la que el Partido Popular Europeo vota con la extrema derecha en lugar de con el bloque a su izquierda en el hemiciclo que tradicionalmente consensúa todas las decisiones en la Eurocámara. Los socialdemócratas se quedaron fuera de la mayoría, a pesar de que estaban de acuerdo con la mayor parte del texto aprobado, el reconocimiento de Edmundo González como presidente y el texto conjunto con la extrema derecha era una línea roja para ellos. Los liberales, por su parte, rechazaron que se haya roto el cordón sanitario y ni siquiera emitieron su voto en señal de protesta, al igual que los verdes. Solo un grupo de socialistas portugueses y un liberal se saltaron la postura de sus grupos. La Europa de las Naciones Soberanas, un segundo grupo de corte de extrema derecha más pequeño, no se sentó a la mesa de negociación de la resolución pero votó también mayoritariamente a favor. Eurodiputados piden apoyo para que Edmundo González pueda asumir la Presidencia En el texto, los eurodiputados solicitaron a la Unión Europea y sus Estados miembros a hacer “lo máximo posible” para que Edmundo González pueda asumir la Presidencia de Venezuela el 10 de enero de 2025. “El respeto de la voluntad del pueblo venezolano, expresada en las elecciones, sigue siendo la única vía para que Venezuela restablezca la democracia, permita una transición pacífica y auténtica y resuelva la actual crisis humanitaria y socioeconómica”, señaló la Eurocámara. También pidieron a la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) que incluya las violaciones de los derechos humanos y las detenciones arbitrarias en curso en sus investigaciones sobre los presuntos crímenes contra la humanidad cometidos por el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro. Además, se exige la liberación “inmediata e incondicional” de todos los presos políticos y las personas detenidas arbitrariamente. En el texto también se aplaudió la decisión del gobierno español de conceder asilo político a González, lo cual, dicen, permite “protegerle y mantener una perspectiva viable de resolución del estancamiento político”. Restablecimiento de sanciones El Parlamento Europeo instó a los gobiernos y al alto representante de la Unión Europea para la Política Exterior, Josep Borrell, a restablecer las sanciones contra miembros del Consejo Nacional Electoral de Venezuela (CNE) y que el resto de medidas contra el gobierno venezolano se prolonguen y amplíen. “Si el 10 de enero de 2025 no se produce un traspaso pacífico de poder y el restablecimiento de la democracia, se producirá un nuevo éxodo migratorio hacia otros países de la región, similar al que ha llevado a cerca de ocho millones de venezolanos a huir del país en los últimos años”, advirtieron los eurodiputados. Con esta resolución, la [Eurocámara](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/es) va -de manera simbólica- más allá que el Consejo de la Unión Europea, en cuyos ministros de Exteriores recae la competencia de la política exterior comunitaria y que a finales del pasado mes de agosto decidieron no reconocer a Maduro como presidente pero tampoco lo hicieron con Edmundo González.
