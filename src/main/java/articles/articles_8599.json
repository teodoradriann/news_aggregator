    "title": "Hate speech and slogans: more anti-Semitic crimes again - The Limited Times",
    "text": "Status: 29.12.2023, 07:21 a.m.\nCommentsPrint Share\nA surveillance camera hangs on a façade. © Marijan Murat/dpa\nHostilities against Jews continue to be part of everyday life in Baden-Württemberg. And it turns out that the decreasing violence is on the rise again after a brief decline. Not all deeds go to German accounts.\nStuttgart - There is agitation and insults, Israeli flags are burned and walls are smeared with slogans. And that almost every day somewhere in Baden-Württemberg. In the first nine months of this year alone, 184 anti-Semitic crimes were registered, which is slightly more than in the first three quarters of the previous year (175). And the number is likely to rise significantly, because the protests following the massacre by the Islamist Hamas in Israel on October 7 are not yet included in the statistics. There is an increase in anti-Semitic crimes in Baden-Württemberg, the Ministry of the Interior said on request.\nA brief look back shows this: In mid-November, the Bundesliga football club VfB Stuttgart banned two spectators from the stadium for racist and anti-Semitic insults. A few days earlier, anti-Semitic paint smears were discovered at the Württembergische Landesbühne in Esslingen and on steps leading to the castle there, unknown persons also smeared the back of Rastatt Castle with slogans in red spray paint, and house walls in Ludwigsburg were also sprayed. In the three weeks after the Hamas attack alone, around 30 crimes related to Israeli flags were registered, according to the State Office of Criminal Investigation.\n\"The Jews' sense of security has been permanently shaken,\" said Baden-Württemberg Interior Minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) against the background of the war against Hamas and the demonstrations against Israel. \"It is intolerable that Jewish people are now hesitant again or do not dare to identify themselves as Jews on our streets.\" Physical assaults and direct confrontations are the absolute exception in the southwest. \"But any destruction and damage to Israeli flags is also unacceptable. Because this also shows the evil grimace of anti-Semitism,\" said Strobl.\nAccording to Baden-Württemberg's anti-Semitism commissioner Michael Blume, Hamas is also using the latest ways to exert influence: \"Hamas has managed to use digital terror propaganda against Israelis to bring even more anti-Semites to the point of committing crimes,\" the doctor of religion and political science told the German Press Agency.\nAccording to Blume, the number of anti-Semitic crimes in Baden-Württemberg has increased by 206 percent in the past ten years. \"However, the longer-term development of anti-Semitic crimes is a cause for concern both in the state and nationwide,\" Blume warns in his report to the state parliament, which has already been presented. \"Anti-Semitism is an experience that many Jews regularly encounter in their everyday lives from the middle of society.\"\nWhile the number of anti-Semitic crimes in Baden-Württemberg was 2017 cases in 99, it increased to 136 a year later and finally to 182 in 2019 and 228 cases in 2020. Two years ago, it suddenly increased to 337, and a year later, after a significant decline, the number of crimes reached 245. And the police do not always see a political motive, it is not always clear what is behind it.\nThe catalogue of anti-Semitic offences includes incitement to hatred as well as insults or the so-called use of signs of unconstitutional organisations, usually the wearing of a swastika. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the focus in the past year was on the damage or removal of flags of the State of Israel, which were hoisted at town halls, for example, as a sign of solidarity. Damage to property in the form of paint smears, some of which incited hatred, also belonged to this area. \"Physical assaults and direct confrontations remain rare,\" the Interior Ministry said.\nAccording to these data, the majority of anti-Semitic crimes are still motivated by right-wing extremism, with a clear upward trend. Of the 184 violent crimes in the first nine months of this year, 135 are attributed to this so-called phenomenon area, compared to 109 cases in the first three quarters of the previous year.\nMy news Lake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nThese outlet centers in Baden-Wurttemberg areRead more\nMother to blame for the death of child (2) from Bingen?

Anti-Semitism has increased on both the left and the right, but it is also imported. \"Many people have come to our country from regions where Israel is considered an enemy and where there is a perception that Jews must be fought,\" Münch said. This anti-Semitism, imported from abroad, must be named and action must be taken against it. Dpa",

    "title": "UW’s role in the perpetual occupation of Palestine",
    "text": "Around this time last year, I wrote an article about\nthe student-led effort of Resist US-Led War Seattle to cut UW’s ties with Boeing. The company’s long-standing influence on UW and enablement of the military pursuits of our government has driven this organization into action.\nResist is a national organization seeking to dismantle imperialism and militarism led by the United States. In Seattle, the local chapter’s work primarily focuses on political education and mobilization of those in the Seattle area — especially college students.\nThe organization shifted gears Oct. 7, when Hamas militants attacked an Israeli city. It provided an opportunity to alert locals on the impact of UW’s partnership with Boeing in the Israeli occupation of Palestine.\nBoeing is a major supplier to the Department of Defense, and the U.S. government is a major supplier of arms to Israel.\nJust last year, Boeing signed a\n$927 million deal with Israel to supply the military with four KC-46A aerial refuelers. Quickly after the initial retaliations against Hamas, Boeing delivered over 1,000 bombs to the Israeli military in their airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.\n“You can’t separate UW from Boeing,” Zho Ragen, a Ph.D. student and member of Resist US-Led War Seattle, said.\nBoeing has been a significant investor in UW since 1917. Along with funding research facilities on campus, the local company recruits a large number of engineering students. As of 2022, roughly 1,200 UW alumni were hired by Boeing in the last five years, and 6,500 alumni are currently working for the company.\nBut do these present and future employees fully grasp the scope of Boeing’s involvement in the upkeep of war?\nNikhil, a UW employee, expressed that he believes students have been misled by mass media institutions and the public education system.\n“More and more, students are experiencing exploitation,” Nikhil said. “They are learning how to dismantle a system that doesn’t serve peoples’ needs.”\nResist Seattle has contributed to this through both their protests and teach-ins.\nAt UW, Resist has led several protests and walk-outs on and around campus, one of them being at the Boeing Military Delivery Center in November of 2023. Along with this action, they prioritize teach-ins, seeking political education. Most recently,\n“From Palestine to Hawai’i: Resist the U.S. War Machine” on Jan. 24 and 25 informed students on issues regarding current U.S. military strategy.\nThese teach-ins seek to explain many of the complex factors of the U.S. power: the role of educational institutions, the current foreign strategy of the Biden administration, and the basis of imperialism.\n“We have power when we’re united and exposing the system,” Nikhil said.\nHistorically, major protests that have led to a change in policy were the result of various marginalized groups acting in solidarity. In the ‘60s and ‘70s, for example, the mass protests incited by anti-war student organizations imposed pressure on the Nixon administration to eventually end the Vietnam War.\nThey’ve collaborated with student organizations like Students United for Palestinian Equality & Return (SUPER) UW, the Black Student Union (BSU), and Anakbayan UW, among many others. More recently, there is a coalition of student organizations called UW United Front working to get UW to cut ties with Boeing and Israel.\n“This is becoming a very strong and bolstering cause for grassroots organizations,” Ragen said. “It’s helping people raise their political consciousness and recognize all of these problems are very interconnected.”\nWhy should college students care about these complex ideas and global events?\n“You don’t need to know much to know this isn’t okay,” Ragen said.\nSimply taking in what is going on every day can say a lot about the situation. Understanding the history is one thing, but seeing how our tuition, taxes, government, and our school is actively contributing to the occupation is alarming in and of itself.\n“The university is facilitating the needs of corporations and fascist governments and U.S. imperialism instead of the needs of students,” Nikhil said.\nOnce people grasp that our struggles as Americans and as students at UW are connected to the external offenses of our own government, the conflicts overseas become much more straightforward. The global economic interests of the U.S. have and will continue to upstage the domestic concerns of its citizens.\n“We want to meet the calls and needs of students for livelihood and international solidarity with peoples’ struggles against imperialism,” Nikhil said.\nRagen explained that the result of this system will always be war and militarism. Consequently, people will resist, and the U.S. will utilize its force to maintain the system — which is what we’re seeing in Gaza now.\nThere’s a lot of history at play in Gaza, much of which the West had a massive role in forming.\nWhat we’re seeing now is a reflection of this occupation, as Palestinians living under the control of the Israeli government are being killed and displaced to make way for Israeli settlers.\nThe U.S. didn’t always support Israel, but the late 1960s changed that, as fears of alliances between Arab nations and the Soviet Union rose. Now, we can see the unwavering military support of Israel under the Biden administration.\nNow, with the death toll in Gaza reaching over 26,000 people – an unprecedented amount in the 75-year conflict — organizations like Resist and other student groups are exposing the imperial roots of corporations and the U.S. government’s involvement in the perpetuation of violence against Palestinians.\nThe deep connections among these institutions are intimidating, but it also means they rely on each other to maintain the system. By bringing attention to UW’s partnership with Boeing and demanding divestment, students can weaken Boeing’s influence domestically and globally.\nReach writer Sophie Knight at X: @knightsophie13\nLike what you’re reading?

    "title": "仅需一束光，\"智能胶水\"实现黏脱自由|水凝胶_新浪科技_新浪网",
    "text": "智能水凝胶黏附材料。\n■本报记者 叶满山\n在自然界中，壁虎能在垂直的玻璃上自由爬行，树蛙能在雨林湿滑的叶片上稳稳附着。这些生物的“超能力”源于其快速可逆的黏附状态切换机制。\n近日，中国科学院兰州化学物理研究所（以下简称兰州化物所）研究员周峰团队与西北工业大学的研究人员合作，通过仿生科学与材料技术的结合，成功解锁了光控智能黏附材料的“新密码”。\n该成果不仅让实验室里的水凝胶材料拥有了“黏”与“脱”的自由切换能力，更为医疗、机器人等领域的技术革新提供了新思路。相关论文发表于《化学与生物工程》。\n从壁虎脚趾到“零残留”智能材料\n“传统胶带撕下来时会疼，医用敷料揭掉时可能二次损伤皮肤，这些痛点让我们开始思考，能否设计一种像壁虎脚掌那样‘按得牢、撕得轻’的智能材料？”周峰道出研究初衷。\n壁虎的脚趾覆盖着数百万根纳米级刚毛，这些刚毛通过范德华力（分子间的吸引力）牢牢吸附在任何物质表面，无需黏性物质即可实现瞬时强黏附。更神奇的是，壁虎只需改变脚趾角度，就能瞬间“解锁”黏附力，轻松脱离。而树蛙的脚趾则依赖微米级沟槽和自分泌黏液，在潮湿环境中保持稳定附着，展现了复杂环境下的适应性。\n“仿生的难点在于，生物的精妙结构和动态调控能力难以直接复制到人工材料中。”周峰坦言，“比如壁虎刚毛的纳米精度制造成本极高，树蛙的黏液分泌需要复杂的生物系统支持。”\n而人工材料往往依赖光、热等外部刺激，响应速度和环境适应性受限。尽管挑战重重，研究人员还是通过仿生结构简化、动态聚合物开发等策略逐步实现类自然界的“智能黏附”。\n团队设计了一种“光控水凝胶”：将光热纳米颗粒四氧化三铁嵌入温敏性水凝胶基体中。当红外光照射时，纳米颗粒将光能转化为热能，触发水凝胶表面分子的“隐身术”——原本暴露的黏附基团被亲水性基团覆盖，黏附力从类似医用胶带的9.86千帕骤降至接近无黏附的0.26千帕。最为关键的是，撤去光源后，材料迅速恢复高黏附状态，且10次循环后无任何残留。\n“这就像给材料装上了‘光控开关’，红外光照或不照就能远程指挥它黏住或松开。”周峰形象地说。\n“小雨伞”的开与合\n要理解这种材料的“魔法”，需要深入到分子层面。研究团队将水凝胶比作“小抓手”和“小雨伞”——负责黏附的儿茶酚基团和负责保护的羧酸基团。\n周峰解释说：“我们可以想象，水凝胶表面有很多小抓手和小雨伞，红外光负责伞的打开与闭合。当没有光的时候，伞叶闭合，小抓手就可以抓住任何外来物体；一旦光控制伞叶打开，小抓手就被伞叶罩住，削弱了小抓手的捕获能力。”\n其中，小抓手就是水凝胶中的黏附基团儿茶酚，而伞叶就是羧酸基团。光是怎么告诉伞叶打开和关闭的呢？这与水凝胶中的四氧化三铁纳米粒子和温敏性官能基团有关。\n纳米粒子能够吸收光，并将其转化为热，而N-异丙基丙烯酰胺基团能够通过热把自身从亲水状态变为疏水状态，从而降低水凝胶的储水能力，使得一部分水从表面渗出。渗出的水诱导羧酸基团迁移到表面，也就是伞叶打开。反之，不用光照射，伞叶关闭。\n实验中，团队意外发现，水分子不仅是物理屏障，还会引发表面分子构象的动态变化。“起初我们只考虑到表面水的渗出，想当然地认为高温下表面黏附性能的削弱主要源于水分子阻隔了界面接触。但后来发现，表面水的出现还牵扯一系列分子构象的变化，而这些变化才是影响界面黏附的关键。”周峰强调，这一发现推翻了早期假设，也让团队对界面黏附机制有了更深理解。\n光控黏附的“柔性革命”\n对于智能黏附材料来说，是否经得起可逆循环是评价其性能优异性的标准，这与未来的潜在应用场景有关。\n在医疗领域，烧伤等大创面深度伤口极易给患者带来感染风险，采用水凝胶类皮肤敷料代替皮肤保护伤口是常见的防护策略。然而，常规敷料的高黏附特性在去除时会给患者带来极大痛苦，具有按需黏附的光控水凝胶可在敷料揭除时保持低黏附，减轻患者疼痛，而在敷于伤口时则实现高黏附。\n“想象一下，医生只需用红外光笔轻轻一照，敷料就能轻松脱离伤口，同时保持湿润环境促进愈合。”周峰描绘了这一场景。\n此外，在机器人领域，这种材料有望成为“轻量化黏附足部”的理想选择。“软体机器人需要在垂直甚至倒挂的表面快速移动，传统电磁或真空吸附系统又重又耗能。而我们的材料仅需一束光，就能实现高效攀爬。”周峰补充道。\n柔性电子设备同样受益匪浅。未来，智能手表或健康监测贴片可能通过光控黏附技术实现“按需贴合”，既避免皮肤过敏，又能确保传感器与皮肤稳定接触。\n这项突破并非一蹴而就。周峰回忆，几年前，团队一直攻关高强韧黏附水凝胶材料，偶然发现一种材料在多次按压后黏性骤降。“该现象引发了我们的极大兴趣，经过对材料的成分分析、机理验证等，才知道原来在多次按压以后，手部温度传递到凝胶表面，致使凝胶发生相变，呈现低黏附态。”这让团队意识到，温度可能是调控黏附性能的钥匙。\n从偶然现象到可控机制，团队历时数年验证了光热效应与分子迁移的协同作用。“科学研究往往源于对异常现象的好奇心。这次偶然发现提醒我们，基础研究的价值在于为应用打开新窗口。”周峰表示，“我们正在探索更高精度的空间控制和更低能耗的响应机制，希望这种材料未来能成为智能装备的‘柔性关节’，让技术更贴近生命的需求。”\n相关论文信息：\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/cbe.4c00177",

    "text": "Adelaide: Josh Hazlewood's career-best haul of 9-79 in red-ball cricket guided Australia to a thumping 10-wicket victory in the first Test against West Indies on Friday at the Adelaide Oval.\nAustralia's clinical performance saw Hazlewood scalping nine and Head scoring a rollicking ton in a Test that lasted just more than two days. Hazlewood with a bit of movement from the pitch blew away West Indies' batting line-up while Head's aggressive strokes kept the opposition bowling line-up at bay.\nThe Caribbean side resumed the day with a score of 73/6 trailing by 22 runs. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood in the first six overs combined to bag three wickets, putting the visitors under pressure.\nShamar Joseph came at the end and showed his skills with the bat by finding the boundary line thrice with composure. He looked poised to play a couple of more shots, but Nathan Lyon's spin got the better of the 24-year-old.\nWest Indies managed to put up 120 on the board leaving the hosts a paltry target of 26.\nSteve Smith and Usman Khawaja stepped on the crease, looking to quickly put West Indies out of their misery. Joseph who impressed in the first innings by dismissing Smith on the first ball of his Test debut was denied the opportunity to bowl with the new ball.\nHis time to bowl came in the fifth over when Australia needed 14 to walk away with victory. In the 7th over, the awkward bounce took Khawaja by surprise and the ball struck him on his helmet as he tried to move out of the line.\nHe ended up retiring hurt with a score of 9, Marnus Labuschagne came in scored the winning runs and sent Australia one up in the series. Both teams will meet at Gabba on January 25.\nEarlier in the Test, Australia reaped rewards from their decision to put West Indies to bat as they restricted the visitors to 188.\nIn reply, the Caribean side put Australia in a tough spot as they claimed five wickets while the hosts managed to put 129 runs on the board. Cummins and Hazlewood scalped four each to put Australia in control.\nBut Travis Head once again proved to be a game-changer for the hosts. His aggressive intent prevented the West Indies from fathoming their way out and making an unexpected return.\nThe visitors put Australia in a tough spot as they claimed five wickets while the hosts managed to put 129 runs on the board. Head on a tricky surface went all guns blazing and scored 119 off 134 deliveries which was laced with 12 boundaries and three maximums.\nHis knock propelled Australia to a score of 283 allowing them to gain a healthy lead of 95 runs. West Indies did walk back with some positives as debutant Shamar Joseph claimed a five-wicket haul. Along with him, Kemar Roach and Justin Greaves bagged two each.\nBrief Score: West Indies 188 & 120 (Kirk McKenzie 26, Justin Greaves 24; Josh Hazlewood 5-35) vs Australia 283 & 26/0 (Steve Smith 11*, Usman Khawaja (retired hurt) 9).",

    "title": "Prop. 36 asks California voters to OK stricter punishments for repeat drug, theft offenders",
    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — This November, Proposition 36 will ask California voters whether to undo a handful of criminal justice reforms they approved a decade ago.\nIn 2014, voters passed another ballot measure called Proposition 47, which reduced punishments for a handful of non-violent drug and theft crimes. Prop. 47 made most drug possession crimes a misdemeanor and raised the threshold for felony theft and forgery from $400 to $950.\nThis year’s Proposition 36 is pushed by a coalition of district attorneys from across the state, along with major retailers like Target and Walmart. It’s aimed at cracking down on retail theft and fentanyl, and supporters argue it would close gaps in the state’s sentencing rules to bring more accountability.\nVideos of retail thefts – from coordinated smash-and-grabs at designer stores to individuals stuffing items in backpacks at drugstores – during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic threw a spotlight on the issue. And the emergence of the potent opioid fentanyl, which led to the deaths of around 6,000 Californians in 2021, has added new urgency to the drug crisis.\nState lawmakers in California’s Democratic supermajority have wrestled with how to address the two issues without undoing the main tenets of Prop. 47, which was passed in part to reduce the population in the state’s overcrowded prisons.\nProgressive Democrats in control of the Legislature’s public safety committees have, for the most part, refused to pass laws that would increase criminal penalties, citing a historically biased criminal justice system that has put disproportionately more Black and brown people behind bars.\nBecause of that, Prop. 36 has fractured the ranks of elected Democrats. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Senate President pro Tem Mike McGuire and other Democratic lawmakers oppose the ballot measure. But some moderate Democratic lawmakers and influential big-city mayors support it.\nNewsom and legislative leaders were even planning a countermeasure earlier this summer, but they abandoned it at the eleventh-hour last month, just before lawmakers recessed for their summer recess.\nWhat a ‘yes’ vote on Prop. 36 means\nProp. 36 contains several components related to criminal punishments. A yes vote would:\n•Increase punishment for certain drug and theft crimes. Currently, theft of property worth $950 or less is usually a misdemeanor. Prop. 36 would make it a felony for people who have two or more previous theft-related convictions on their record.\n•Create a new “treatment-mandated felony” classification for drug crimes. If a person with two or more previous drug convictions is charged with possession of a substance — specifically, fentanyl, heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine — they could be ordered to get treatment. Those who finish treatment could have their charges dismissed; however, failure to complete treatment could result in a sentence of up to three years in prison.\n•Require courts to warn people convicted of selling or giving drugs to others that they could be charged with murder if they sell drugs that kill someone.\nWhat a ‘no’ vote means\nA no vote on Proposition 36 would keep criminal sentencing laws as they are: theft valued under $950 and drug possession crimes would continue to generally be prosecuted as misdemeanors, with a punishment of up to one year in jail.\nWho supports Prop. 36?\nProp. 36 is supported by a broad swath of business and law enforcement groups, the California Republican Party and a smattering of Democratic elected officials.\nThe California Business Roundtable, California Sheriffs Association, California District Attorneys Association and the California Retailers Association are supporting the measure.\nMayors supporting Prop. 36 include Democrats London Breed of San Francisco, Todd Gloria of San Diego, Matt Mahan of San Jose and Bobbie Singh-Allen of Elk Grove.\n“California is suffering from an explosion in crime and the trafficking of deadly hard drugs like fentanyl,” proponents wrote in official ballot arguments for the measure. “Prop. 36 will fix the mess our politicians have ignored for far too long. It is a balanced approach that corrects loopholes in state law that criminals exploit to avoid accountability for fentanyl trafficking and repeat retail theft.”\nAs of mid-August, the Yes campaign had raised more than $7.9 million. Top donors include major retailers like Walmart ($2.5 million), Target ($1 million) and Home Depot ($1 million).\nOpponents of Prop. 36\nWhile some Democrats are supporting Prop. 36, many others oppose it, including Newsom, lawmakers and some progressive DAs, including Diana Becton of Contra Costa County.\nThe initiative also faces opposition from criminal justice reform groups like the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and the Vera Institute of Justice.\n“We must address persistent problems like theft and fentanyl, but we must use solutions that work and are targeted at the actual issue, instead of the scattershot failed solutions of the past,” opponents wrote in the official ballot arguments\n“By making simple drug possession a felony, this measure will send thousands into state prison, drive up prison costs, and slash money for local safety programs. That will make crime worse, not better.”\nAs of mid-August a ballot committee opposing Prop. 36 had raised $195,000, with sizeable donations from the ACLU of Northern California along with philanthropists Quinn Delaney and Stacy H. Schusterman.\nFiscal impacts of Prop. 36\nIf approved, Prop. 36 would likely increase state criminal justice costs by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars; counties could also pay tens of millions more, according to an analysis by the Legislative Analyst’s Office.\nThat’s because harsher criminal punishments means people convicted of these crimes would spend more time in prison.\nThe LAO analysis predicts the state prison population, which is currently around 90,000, could grow by “a few thousand people” under Prop. 36. Statewide, county jails could see a similar increase.\nState court workloads would also increase since felonies take more time to resolve than misdemeanors.\nFinally, by undoing parts of Prop. 47, the measure could mean less funding for mental health, drug treatment, and other prevention programs.\n©2024 The Sacramento Bee.
