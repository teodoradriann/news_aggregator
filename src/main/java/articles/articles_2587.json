    "text": "Image by Author\nHave you ever wanted to study computer science but didn’t want to pay the high cost of college tuition? Well, you’re in luck! There is an incredible open-source curriculum called OSSU (Open Source Society University) that allows you to enroll in the equivalent of a 4-year computer science degree program entirely for free.\nossu/computer-science provides a complete education in computer science concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines. The curriculum is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors at leading universities. It uses high-quality courses from platforms like edX, Coursera, and Udacity taught by professors from schools like MIT, Harvard, and Princeton.\nImage from\nhttps://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#advanced-cs\nThe coursework covers everything from programming languages, algorithms, and data structures to operating systems, computer architecture, and software engineering. After completing the core CS requirements, you can choose advanced electives to specialize in areas like software testing, game theory, linear algebra, and more.\nThe best parts are that all the course materials are freely available online, and you can complete the program at your own pace. While it is possible to finish in 2 years if you study around 20 hrs/week, you can adjust based on your schedule. You also join a worldwide community of independent learners who support each other.\nPrerequisites\nComputer science curriculum has prerequisite expectations at different stages:\n- Core CS: Students must have prior high school level math background including algebra, geometry and pre-calculus.\n- Advanced CS: Students can only choose advanced electives after finishing all required courses in the Core CS section first.\n- Advanced Systems: Any student wanting to specialize in the Advanced Systems electives must have previously taken at least one basic physics course in high school or college.\nIntro CS\nThe Intro CS section has beginner-level courses to help students new to computer science understand if it is the right fit for them. It covers introductory programming to teach basic coding concepts and introductory computer science to provide students with an understanding of computation’s role in solving problems.\nCore CS\nThe Core CS section has all the coursework equivalent to the first 3 years of a university computer science degree. It builds a strong base across essential areas like:\n- Core programming: Covers languages, testing, design patterns, architecture, etc.\n- Core math: Builds mathematical maturity required for data structures, algorithms, etc.\n- CS tools: Introduces commonly used tools for tasks like version control, shell scripting, etc.\n- Core systems: Deals with OS, networking, compilation, and computer architecture.\n- Core theory: Fundamental theoretical concepts like algorithms, NP-completeness, etc.\n- Core security: Secure coding, cryptography, and vulnerabilities.\n- Core applications: Databases, machine learning, computer graphics, etc.\n- Core ethics: Explores ethical implications of technology in society.\nAdvanced CS\nAfter completing all required Core CS courses, students should choose additional Advanced CS courses based on their interests and intended field.\n- Advanced Programming: Covers topics like debugging, parallel computing, UML, software architecture, compilers, functional programming with Haskell, and more.\n- Advanced Systems: Goes deeper into digital logic, computer organization, pipelining, parallel processing, virtualization, and other lower-level computing concepts.\n- Advanced Theory: Includes formal language theory, Turing machines, computability, concurrency models, computational geometry, logic, and game theory.\n- Advanced Information Security: Provides more specialized security knowledge like compliance, digital forensics, secure development lifecycle, and verification.\n- Advanced Math: Includes linear algebra, numerical methods, formal logic, probability theory, and other important mathematical foundations for computer science.\nFinal Project\nThe final project requires students to apply all their learnings by building something useful. This provides tangible proof of their knowledge and skills for showcasing to potential employers.\nCreating a project not only looks great on a resume but also validates and reinforces your knowledge. You can build something new from scratch or contribute to an existing open-source project in need of help.\nFor more guidance, there are structured course specializations oriented around projects you may pursue. Topics include full-stack development, data science, robotics, and beyond. With the core foundations, you can now identify series matching your interests.\nWhen your final project is complete, submit information on it to the OSSU\nPROJECTS via a pull request. Also, add the OSSU badge to your project README. Then, use community channels to announce your creation to fellow students.\nThe evaluation is done by getting feedback from peers and showcasing abilities rather than traditional grading. It also lets OSSU evaluate how well its curriculum prepares independent learners for real achievements.\nThe OSSU computer science degree program offers a fantastic opportunity for those who are interested in studying computer science without the burden of high tuition fees. With a well-structured curriculum that covers all the fundamental concepts of computer science, you can gain a comprehensive education in this field.

The highest number of violent deaths this century was in 2000 when 52 people were killed. Last year, the murder total was 12.\nFour of this year’s killings were down to guns, four to stabbings and two people were beaten to death. The cause of death in the final one has yet to be confirmed. Nine victims were men and two were women.\nLocal police chief Frank Paauw said earlier he is concerned about the number of violent incidents involving psychiatric patients. They were responsible for three murders this year and several other serious attacks.\nWhile crime-related deaths fell, there was a surge in the number of attacks on private homes and businesses using explosives. In the Netherlands as a whole there have been almost 700 this year, compared with 228 in 2022, the Parool said.\n ",

    "text": "Bei TV-Aufzeichnungen hat Playback viele Vorteile, wie einen guten Sound und eine geringere Anfälligkeit von Spielfehlern. Doch bei einem Auftritt im \"Fernsehgarten\" hat das sogenannte Lip-syncing nicht geklappt. Zwei Gäste von Andrea Kiewel fielen den Zuschauern am Sonntag (13. Juli) negativ auf.\nPlayback bei \"Fernsehgarten\"-Gästen fällt durch\nIsaak und Myle performen den Song \"What If\". Zunächst steht Myle alleine auf der Bühne. Und schon hier merkt man schnell: Manche Lippenbewegungen und die Handhabung des Mikrofons passen nicht zur Musik. Ein langgezogenes \"Mmmmmmh\" kommt sogar ganz ohne Mikro am Mund daher. Sein Songpartner Isaak, der 2024 für Deutschland beim ESC antrat und den zwölften Platz belegte, performt da etwas besser, als er auf die Bühne kommt.\nDer Playback-Patzer bleibt natürlich den Zuschauern nicht verborgen. Auf der Social-Media-Plattform X witzeln einige User über die Performance.\n\"Fernsehgarten\"-Moderatorin über ihr Leben im Israel-Krieg: Andrea Kiewel spricht offen wie nie.\nZuschauer kritisieren \"Fernsehgarten\"-Auftritt\n\"Playback singen will halt gelernt sein. Entweder kann man es – oder eben nicht\", motzt ein User. \"Playback muss man halt können\", stellt ein anderer fest. \"Schreckliches Playback\", findet ein weiterer Zuschauer. Ein X-User fasst knallhart zusammen: \"Playback singen durchgefallen.\"\nDer Popsong findet dennoch bei einigen \"Fernsehgarten\"-Fans Anklang. \"Mal nicht so schlecht. Kann man sich fast anhören\", resümiert ein User. \"Cooler Song\", liest man ebenfalls unter dem Hashtag \"Fernsehgarten\". Auf dem Mainzer Lerchenberg haben die Zuschauer auch ordentlich mitgeklatscht.",

    "text": "O próximo compromisso do São Paulo acontece no dia 12, quinta-feira, contra o Atlético-MG, fora de casa, pela volta das quartas de final da [Copa do Brasil](https://www.gazetaesportiva.com/campeonatos/copa-do-brasil/). Para essa partida, entretanto, Jamal Lewis não poderá ser relacionado, já que o regulamento da competição prevê que novas inscrições poderão ser feitas antes do início de uma das fases. Ou seja, ele só poderá participar da campanha do Tricolor no torneio, caso o time elimine o Galo e avance para a semifinal. Já no duelo do dia 15, contra o Cruzeiro, no Mineirão, pelo [Campeonato Brasileiro](https://gazetaesportiva.com/campeonatos/brasileiro-serie-a/), Jamal Lewis, enfim, terá condições de fazer sua estreia com a camisa do São Paulo, caso o técnico Luis Zubeldía ache que ele está pronto para contribuir com a equipe dentro de campo. O britânico também poderá ficar à disposição na Libertadores. A Conmebol permite que até três alterações sejam feitas na lista de inscritos antes das quartas e da semifinal do torneio sul-americano. Resta saber se já contra o Cruzeiro, pelo Brasileiro, o treinador argentino irá relacionar o lateral esquerdo britânico, uma vez que ele não participará de boa parte da intertemporada do São Paulo nesses próximos dias por ter sido convocado para defender a seleção da Irlanda do Norte nesta Data Fifa de setembro, disputando a Liga das Nações. Nesta quinta-feira, Jamal Lewis começou a partida contra Luxemburgo, no Windsor Park, em Belfast, pela Liga C da Liga das Nações, mas foi acionado no início do segundo tempo para ajudar a manter a vitória parcial por 2 a 0 construída na etapa inicial. No próximo domingo, o adversário será a Bulgária, fora de casa. Enquanto Jamal Lewis não retorna ao Brasil para iniciar os treinamentos com o elenco do São Paulo, Luis Zubeldía seguirá trabalhando com a única opção de origem para a lateral esquerda disponível: Welington. Com o garoto Patryck Lanza se recuperando de uma fratura na clavícula, o treinador argentino deverá recorrer ao meia-atacante Michel Araújo, improvisado, caso haja necessidade de utilizar algum outro atleta no setor.",
