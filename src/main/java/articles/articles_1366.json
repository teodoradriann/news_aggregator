    "text": "Este domingo en la tarde será la celebración de institución de nuevos ministerios y la renovación de quienes ya los están ejerciendo, en sus comunidades parroquiales, en la Iglesia de Cartagena. Es bueno que recordemos el sentido del ministerio en la Iglesia, porque todo ministerio tiene como origen un don del Espíritu para prestar un servicio preciso que la comunidad reconoce y es relativamente estable. Cuando ese ministerio se recibe en rito propio, establecido por la Iglesia, tenemos ministerios instituidos laicales. En virtud del sacramento del bautismo, todos estamos llamados a ser servidores de la comunidad; de manera que el bautismo es fuente de ministerialidad, de impulso a servir que nos construya cada día y cada vez más en una Iglesia comunión de seguidoras de Jesucristo, signo de la unión con Dios y de los seres humanos entre nosotros; así lo señala el Vaticano II cuando afirma que la Iglesia es sacramento de comunión. Por ello, los ministros laicales que iniciarán sus servicios no tienen un poder sobre lo sagrado sino un servicio a la evangelización, con expresiones en las celebraciones litúrgicas. Los ministros laicos no son una élite en las comunidades parroquiales, su gran tentación puede ser el clericalismo, el sentirse parte de un grupo de separados del pueblo, ostentadores de un poder sobre lo sagrado, o en las celebraciones litúrgicas. El papa Francisco ha insistido con ocasión y sin ella que es necesaria la superación del clericalismo como la mentalidad y las prácticas que puedan darse para sentirse más que el resto de la comunidad de hermanos, de allí su insistencia en la igualdad fundamental de todos los bautizados, todos y todas. Que los nuevos ministros se sientan bien y felices de ser servidores y no poseedores de un poder, llamados a construir comunidad desde sus diversos servicios y no a generar descontentos y sinsabores por un clericalismo exacerbado, porque algunos laicos pueden ser más clericalistas que los clérigos porque no han crecido en la vivencia de su fe como miembros del pueblo santo fiel de Dios, buscando hacer presente desde ya el mundo de justicia, solidaridad, paz y amor predicado por el maestro Jesucristo. Que nuestros ministros de la iglesia de Cartagena, tanto los que se inician como los que renuevan, sean ante todo alegres servidores de la consolidación de unas parroquias comunión de comunidades, en salida hacia las situaciones más duras y complejas que viven sus hermanos y testimonio real de capacidad de generar pequeñas comunidades donde se busca vivir el espíritu de los primeros cristianos. Porque son evangelizadores, realizan unas funciones de promoción de la comunidad y la liturgia. Dios quiera que nunca lo olviden. Y felicitaciones desde esta reflexión a todas y todos.",

    "text": "A controversial conservative commentator has sparked debate after declaring that she hoped the Matildas would lose their first game.\nKobie Thatcher, who is known for her outspoken views, shared a post on social media on Thursday night.\n‘I’ll say it now because I’m not staying up until 3am: I hope the woke Matildas lose tomorrow morning’s game,’ she wrote.\nHer hopes were fulfilled when, at 3am AEST, Tony Gustavsson’s side succumbed to a 3-0 thrashing at the hands of Germany in the opening Group B match in Marseille.\nWhile some labelled Ms Thatcher’s comments ‘unpatriotic’ and ‘un-Australian’, many others praised her position.\n‘As predicted, they were dreadful,’ former NSW One Nation leader Mark Lathan said.\n‘Over-hyped by the media, as usual.’\nKobie Thatcher, who is known for her outspoken views,said she refused to wake up to watch the Matildas and hoped they would lose\nHer hopes were fulfilled when, at 3am AEST, Tony Gustavsson’s side succumbed to a 3-0 thrashing at the hands of Germany in the opening Group B match in Marseille (pictured: stunned players after the loss)\nSeveral others accused the Matildas of being overly focussed on ‘woke’ issues at the expense of their football.\n‘Can’t say I’m sad to see this woke, arrogant, overrated bunch who have achieved nothing get embarrassed on the world stage yet again,’ seethed one online commentator.\nAnother asked: ‘When will sports administrators learn the lesson of: Go Woke, Go Broke?’\nIt is unclear exactly why the Matildas have been accused of being ‘woke’.\nIn 2021, Pauline Hanson criticised the team for posing with the Aboriginal flag before a match.\nWhile not as overtly critical, many loyal fans were left equally disappointed by the Matildas’ lacklustre performance.\n‘Ahhhh Tillies this is hard to watch at 4.30am,’ said one fan as the third goal went in.\nAnother said: ‘Not exactly what you hope for when you get up at 3am to watch.’\n‘This is rough for 4.30am,’ said a third fan.\nOther fans highlighted a lack of energy from the World Cup semi-finalists, an uncharacteristic trait from Gustavsson’s side.\n‘Matildas are so unfit it’s not even funny anymore,’ said one fan.\nAnother added: ‘This is the worst I’ve seen them play in a long while.’\nSeveral critics accused the Matildas of being overly focussed on ‘woke’ issues at the expense of their football\nBut for most fans, there was only one person to blame for the team’s Marseille misery.\n‘Tony Gustavsson has rarely got it wrong in matches during major tournaments during his tenure, but this one ranks alongside the Nigeria nightmare,’ one fans said.\n‘Wrong tactics with the high press and because of that starting the wrong players.’\n‘Tony Gustavsson is the Brad Fittler of women’s football,’ another fan said. ‘Straight up holding our team back.’\nThe Matildas barely created a worthwhile chance, any decent approach work being scuppered by poor build-up delivery, and the Germans were decisive winners with two headed goals for Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller from corners, before 21-year-old Jule Brand fittingly wrapped up the most comprehensive of victories.\nIt is not the first time Ms Thatcher has caused a stir with her comments.\nEarlier this year, she accused the bosses of Westfield Bondi Junction of ‘woke nonsense’ after they held a ‘community reflection day’ when they reopened following the stabbing murders of six people at the hands of schizophrenic knifeman Joel Cauchi.\nShe doubled down in a subsequent post, writing: ‘Virtue Signalling Day at Bondi Junction. Oh, I mean “Community Reflection Day”.’\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

    "title": "Did Social Security numbers get leaked? What we can VERIFY | wcnc.com",
    "text": "On Aug. 14, an X post with over 8.5 million views claimed that the personal information of nearly every American, including Social Security numbers and physical addresses, may have been compromised in a recent data breach.\n“Every American’s Social Security number may have been stolen in a new major hack, with over 2.7 billion records allegedly compromised from National Public Data. The stolen information includes Social Security numbers and physical addresses,” the viral post said .\nSimilar posts are also circulating online.\nMultiple readers, including Carol, have asked us whether their personal information is now at risk. Here’s what we can VERIFY.\nTHE SOURCES Social Security Administration Class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP Top Class Actions McAfee , information security company Hack Manac , a cybersecurity company VX-Underground , an international cybersecurity research group National Cybersecurity Alliance U.S. Public Information Research Group (PIRG) , a non-profit consumer watchdog Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter!\nWHAT WE FOUND Initial reports of the alleged data breach stem from a class-action lawsuit filed in Florida in August.\nThe lawsuit , which was filed by California resident Christopher Hofmann on Aug. 1, alleges that hackers gained access to the personal information of “billions of individuals” from National Public Data, a background check company based in Coral Springs, Florida.\nNational Public Data scrapes data from public record databases, national and state databases, and court records, including nonpublic sources, according to Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP , a law firm investigating the breach.\nSchubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP says National Public Data then sells this private data to a wide range of organizations, including background check websites, investigators, app developers, and data resellers.\n“Because individuals did not affirmatively provide their private information to NPD, individuals may not even know that they have been affected,” Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP said.\nHofmann claims his identity theft protection service notified him in late July that his personal information had been compromised by the “nationalpublicdata.com” breach.\nThe lawsuit claims the exposed information includes Social Security numbers, past and current addresses, names, and information about parents and siblings. Cybersecurity experts warn that this is the type of sensitive data that could allow a scammer to take out a loan in your name or gain access to your banking information.\nTop Class Actions says at least two more class-action lawsuits have also been filed against National Public Data concerning the same data breach.\nHas National Public Data or SSA confirmed the breach? As of Aug. 15, National Public Data, the defendant in the lawsuit, has not confirmed the data breach and the company did not immediately respond to VERIFY’s request for comment.\nMeanwhile, a Social Security Administration (SSA) spokesperson said in an email that “recent reports related to a data breach are unrelated to the Social Security Administration’s internal systems and data, neither of which has been compromised.”\nIt is unclear if National Public Data has alerted people whose information was compromised in the alleged breach, though Hofmann’s lawsuit claims the company had “still not provided any notice or warning” to him.\nSome states require companies to report data breaches to their attorneys general offices. However, information security company McAfee said on Aug. 14 that it had not found any filings related to the breach.\nFlorida law requires companies to file notices of any data breach that impacts 500 or more Floridians.\nWhen did the alleged breach happen? The exact date of the data breach is unclear, but it is believed to have taken place sometime in or around April 2024, according to Hofmann’s lawsuit .\nThe complaints allege that a cybercriminal group named USDoD gained access to National Public Data’s network and then published and sold its findings on the dark web.\nOne of the lawsuits claims the breach was first reported on June 1, by VX-Underground , an international cybersecurity research group, according to Top Class Actions .\nTop Class Actions says VX-Underground claimed that the cybercriminal group “USDoD” was behind the attack and had posted the database containing 2.9 billion records for sale online for $3.5 million. VX-Underground also confirmed the authenticity of the data.\nVX-Underground says the stolen database includes 277.1 gigabytes of data, including names, address histories, relatives, and Social Security numbers dating back at least three decades, according to Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP .\nUSDoD has no affiliation with the U.S. Department of Defense, which is commonly referred to by the acronym “DOD.”\nHow can I protect myself? Although the data breach has not yet been confirmed by National Public Data, cybersecurity experts recommended that you freeze your credit if you suspect your Social Security number or other personal information has been compromised.\nIt’s free to freeze your credit with the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, according to the U.S. Public Information Research Group (PIRG) , a non-profit consumer watchdog.\nFreezing your credit can block bad actors from taking out a loan or opening a new credit card in your name. But PIRG warns to never freeze your credit in response to an unsolicited email or text claiming to be from one of the credit agencies because it could be a scam.\nThe National Cybersecurity Alliance says freezing your credit will limit access to your credit reports, and you’ll have to remember to unfreeze your credit if you’re applying for a new credit card or mortgage. PIRG notes that freezing your credit does not directly increase or decrease your credit score.\nYou can freeze your accounts with the three major credit bureaus by phone or online:\nEquifax Experian TransUnion You can also sign up for a tracking service that will alert you if your data appears on the dark web through services provided by companies like Norton and Google One .\nIf you suspect you are a victim of identity theft, the Social Security Administration recommends:\nContacting the Federal Trade Commission at www.idtheft.gov , or call 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338); TTY 1-866-653-4261, Filing a police report with the police department where the identity theft took place and keeping a copy of the police report as proof of the crime, Contacting the fraud unit of one of the three consumer reporting companies Reporting Social Security scams online at oig.ssa.gov",

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class-action lawsuit has been filed against TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMDX), a medical technology company specializing in organ transplant therapy, alleging that the company and certain executives engaged in fraudulent practices and concealed safety issues. The suit, captioned Jewik v. TransMedics Group, Inc., No. 25-cv-10385 (D. Mass.), represents investors who purchased or acquired TransMedics securities between February 28, 2023, and January 10, 2025.\nHagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased TransMedics shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\nClass Period: Feb. 28, 2023 – Jan. 10, 2025\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Apr. 15, 2025\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/tmdx\nContact the Firm Now: TMDX@hbsslaw.com\n844-916-0895\nThe TransMedics Group (TMDX) Class Action\nThe complaint alleges that TransMedics made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose crucial information. Specifically, the suit contends that TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to boost business and revenue. Furthermore, it alleges that the company engaged in unsafe practices, concealed safety problems, and generally lacked adequate safety oversight, exposing TransMedics to heightened regulatory risk.\nThe lawsuit details two events that allegedly disclosed defendants’ misconduct to the market that adversely impacted the company’s stock price. On February 21, 2024, Representative Paul Gosar issued a letter accusing TransMedics of misappropriating corporate resources. The allegations were subsequently reported by The Daily Caller on February 22, 2024, causing a drop in TransMedics' stock price, according to the complaint.\nMore recently, on January 10, 2025, activist short seller Scorpion Capital released a report leveling accusations against TransMedics, including overbilling hospitals, coercing customers into using specific services, and providing patients with organs rejected by reputable physicians via doctors allegedly paid by TransMedics.\nThis report further depressed the company’s stock price, the lawsuit claims.\nProminent investor rights firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP is probing whether TransMedics misled investors regarding its sales practices.\n“We are looking into claims that TransMedics engaged in improper billing practices and concealed safety issues.

The pair are reportedly seeking unspecified damages.\nHere’s What Allegedly Occurred In The November 2022 Car Crash & What Will Reportedly Happen Next Per the outlet, the lawsuit alleges that April Almanza Lopez and Kiara Rae McGillen were driving on a highway on November 13, 2022. While traveling the roadway in Littlerock, California, the father and son reportedly “slammed into” their car.\nAdditionally, TMZ notes that Lopez and McGillen “sustained injuries that will require further medical attention.” PEOPLE notes that the women also paid for “physicians, surgeons, and others” for “examination, treatment, and care.”\nFurthermore, their vehicle was reportedly damaged and “has lost value due to the wreck.”\nLastly, PEOPLE notes that a hearing for the case has reportedly been scheduled for February 19, 2025.\nBronny & LeBron James Recently Made Their Father-Son Lakers Debut According to TMZ , LeBron and Bronny James’ debut on the court was nothing short of “memorable.” The outlet adds that the pair played together on the court for “several minutes,” and the Lakers ultimately took home a 110-103 victory.\nFurthermore, Bronny and LeBron are now the “first father-and-son duo to ever play in a game together.”\n“That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, is something I will never forget,” LeBron reportedly said postgame. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.”\nRELATED: WATCH: LeBron James Weighs In On Bronny’s Lakers Draft Amid His Summer League Debut",

    "title": "Increase in U.S. softwood lumber duties 'entirely unwarranted,' trade minister says - Prince George Citizen",
    "text": "OTTAWA — The federal government is lashing out at the U.S. Commerce Department over plans to raise duties on Canadian softwood lumber. International Trade Minister Mary Ng says the U.S. has signalled it intends to raise duties to 13.86 per cent, up from 8.05 per cent. Ng calls the move disappointing and entirely unwarranted. It's only the latest salvo in a bilateral back-and-forth that Ottawa has described as a drag on efforts to improve the cost and supply of housing. Last month, Ng vowed to contest a U.S. International Trade Commission decision to keep the duties in place. She says Canada will fight the duties by every means available, including litigation through existing trade agreements, as well as the World Trade Organization and the U.S. Court of International Trade. Canada is \"extremely disappointed\" in the latest finding by the Commerce Department, she said. \"This measure is entirely unwarranted.\" At the same time, she said, the federal government stands ready to negotiate a resolution to the dispute that has dogged the Canada-U. S. relationship for decades. \"We will continue to work closely with provinces, territories and industry to defend Canadian interests through all available avenues,\" Ng said. \"We remain ready and willing to work with the United States toward a negotiated solution that allows for a return to predictable cross-border trade in softwood lumber.\" The B.C. government issued a similar statement Thursday, saying the Commerce Department decision is \"deeply disappointing.\" \"The continued application of unjustified duties on B.C. softwood lumber exports to the U.S. is hurting Canadians and Americans alike,\" said the joint statement attributed to Forests Minister Bruce Ralston, Jobs Minister Brenda Bailey, and several other officials. \"As we work with our industry partners to develop a dependable and sustainable forest industry in B.C., we are continually impeded by these tariffs, leading to higher prices and unstable markets on both sides of the border.\" The vice-president of the BC Lumber Trade Council, Kurt Niquidet, also responded to the potential hike in duties, saying the Commerce Department has \"departed from certain long-standing methodologies at the urging of U.S. industry.\" \"Although these rates are not yet finalized, they continue to misrepresent reality: B.C. and Canadian producers are not subsidized and are not dumping in the U.S. market,\" the statement says. It says the tariffs are increasing the cost of lumber and building materials south of the border, \"at a time when the shortage of affordable housing is having a severe impact on families across the country.\" In October, Canada cheered a decision by a NAFTA dispute panel that found aspects of how the U.S. calculates the duties are inconsistent with federal law. Under the U.S. Tariff Act, the Department of Commerce determines whether goods are being sold at less than fair value or if they're benefiting from subsidies provided by foreign governments. In Canada, lumber-producing provinces set so-called stumpage fees for timber harvested from Crown land, a system that U.S. producers — forced to pay market rates — consider an unfair subsidy.
