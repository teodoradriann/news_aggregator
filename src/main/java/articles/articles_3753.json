    "text": "Inter Miami's preseason form took another hit on Thursday in Riyadh when they lost 6-0 to Al-Nassr that leaves the MLS team still searching for their first win of preseason, four games in. Lionel Messi came on as a sub and played just six minutes, but Miami's other stars Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba failed to leave a meaningful mark on the game. The visitors were down 3-0 by the 12th minute, with the third goal coming from former Manchester City defender Aymeric Laporte. His goal was a highlight-reel-worthy one since he scored from well within his own half and successfully aimed straight for goal after noticing goalkeeper Drake Callendar was way off his line. للتاريخ يا لابورت.. ثالث الأهداف النصراوية ⚽🔥🤩— SSC (@ssc_sports) [#النصر_انترميامي] [#كأس_موسم_الرياض]| [#SSC] [pic.twitter.com/NDheLNMmN0] [February 1, 2024] Al-Nassr followed up their first half exploits with three more goals in the second half. The match serves as a boost for the Saudi Pro League side as they wrap up their midseason break but only makes an unideal preseason worse for Miami. Messi played a limited role after experiencing discomfort in his leg and underwent an MRI and was once expected to sit out the match entirely as a precaution, per the Miami Herald. His brief cameo suggests the issue is a short-term one, but it at least offered attendees a peek at one of the stars who received top billing in the friendly. The match was originally touted as the latest, and perhaps final, meeting between Messi and his longtime on-field rival Cristiano Ronaldo, but the Al-Nassr star missed the game with an undisclosed injury . In addition to continuing the search for their first preseason win, Inter Miami have gone without scoring a goal in three of their four preseason games. The team also lost young talents Benjamin Cremaschi and Facundo Farias to short and long-term injuries, making their preparation for the 2024 season full of hurdles. Miami's next preseason game is on Sunday against the Hong Kong XI in Hong Kong, and they have two additional games before opening their season against Real Salt Lake on Feb. 21.

    "text": "New York, Dec 28 (IANS) Gas prices across the US are projected to fall in the new year in 2024 for the second successive year resulting in a net saving of about $32 billion on fuel costs for the Americans.Oil experts predict that US gas prices will average $3.38 a gallon in the key election year of 2024 representing a significant improvement from this year's average of $3.51 a gallon and an even bigger drop from the average of 2022 of $3.95.\nGas prices skyrocketed to record highs that year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine set off global shockwaves, media reports said.\nGas stations around the country boosted prices by an average of 26 cents a gallon over the past month, as irregular temperatures made fuel-making more challenging due to the slowing of cooling processes needed to refine crude oil .\nEven as the Russia-Ukraine war still lingers and there is a risk the Israel-Hamas war spills into a regional conflict, GasBuddy, an oil and gas analyst, is betting drivers will get more relief in 2024.\nGasBuddy expects Americans will spend about $32 billion less on fuel than in 2023 and $79 billion less than in 2022.\n\"Next year should represent a continued march towards what most Americans would consider normal prices at the pump,\" Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis, told CNN.\nThe price drop forecast bodes well for consumers. White House can exercise caution as optimism emerges while fighting an uphill battle trying to sell its economic message to a sceptical public, CNN analysts wrote.\nCheaper gas prices would give the Federal Reserve a carte blanche as it seeks to pull off a rare soft landing of the US economy by taming inflation without starting a recession. The Feds closely monitor gas prices but it's not included in its \"core\" inflation gauge.\n\"Gas prices may still be a bit elevated but considering wage growth, it is taking less of Americans' hard work to pay for that gallon of gasoline,\" De Haan said.\nGasBuddy doesn't see gas prices averaging $4 a gallon in any single month next year.\nThe US is an energy power house that pumps more oil than any other country in the world , according to S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI ) Insights.\nIn December 2022, GasBuddy projected gas prices would average $3.49 a gallon in 2023. That forecast was nearly spot-on, with actual gas prices averaging $3.51 a gallon so far this year.\n--IANS\nash/pgh\nAdd Chart to Comment",

O alerta telefônico dizia: “Isso não é um treino.” As pessoas no Havaí mergulharam em buracos na rua, foram para suas casas ou para outros lugares, como cavernas. 20 minutos depois, o Sistema de Emergências do Estado do Havaí emitiu um pedido de desculpas por um operador de sistemas ter apertado o botão errado.\nMas este exercício mostrou ao povo do Havaí o quanto nosso mundo está próximo de um ataque nuclear. Não sabemos de onde viria um tal ataque, mas, em minha opinião, a maior probabilidade é que ele seja iniciado por Israel ou pelos EUA.\nNão quero tirar o foco da guerra de Gaza, mas na Ásia e em partes do Oriente Médio, o governo Biden está realizando várias ações tão perigosas como a do apoio ao genocídio israelense dos palestinos em Gaza.\nA administração Biden está ignorando os avisos e as linhas vermelhas da China, Coreia do Norte, Irã e Líbano, assim como a administração ignorou avisos da Rússia sobre exercícios militares de guerra em sua fronteira e o convite para Ucrânia se juntar à OTAN, linhas vermelhas sobre as quais a Rússia já vinha avisando os Estados Unidos há décadas.\nA China advertiu os EUA de que Taiwan (Formosa) faz parte da China, enquanto a administração Biden continua no seu caminho de guerra iniciado pelas administrações Obama e Trump. A política de “Uma só China”, iniciada pela administração Nixon há 40 anos, foi torpedeada pela venda implacável de armas militares e pelas visitas de altos funcionários do Estado e militares dos EUA a Taiwan. A resposta chinesa a cada visita destes funcionários a Taiwan, é uma armada de mais de 40 caças a jato chineses que voam muito perto da zona de defesa aérea de Taiwan. Os chineses consideram o Mar do Sul da China como o seu “quintal da frente”, enquanto os EUA consideram todo o Oceano Pacífico como o seu “quintal dos fundos.”\nMais uma vez, recentemente, o governo da Coreia do Norte avisou a Coreia do Sul e os EUA para terminarem os seus exercícios de guerra ao longo da zona desmilitarizada com a Coreia do Norte . O governo norte-coreano ficou particularmente irritado com esses exercícios de guerra que apelam à “decapitação” do líder da Coreia do Norte, Kim Jung Un , um apelo explícito ao assassinato do líder do país.\n“Agora vai ser a altura em que o belicismo funciona” (Imagem por World Beyond War)\nNo Oriente Médio, o governo Biden sabia que o ataque de drones israelenses em Beirute, no Líbano, em 3 de janeiro de 2024, que matou parte da liderança do Hamas, não ficaria sem resposta. Os EUA sabiam que o Hezbollah havia dito que, se algum líder do Hamas fosse morto por Israel enquanto estivesse no Líbano, haveria retaliação. No entanto, o governo Biden deu luz verde a Israel para cometer esse assassinato, ou pelo menos fechou os olhos para a inteligência compartilhada sobre o planejamento do mesmo.\nO aparente ataque do ISIS, em vez de um provável ataque de drone israelense em 3 de janeiro de 2024, que matou 103 pessoas e feriu 141 em uma cerimônia de homenagem ao general iraniano Soleimani, ressalta outro ponto quente no Oriente Médio. Soleimani foi assassinado há quatro anos por um ataque de drone de Trump contra o general iraniano, que estava no Iraque ajudando o governo iraquiano a combater o ISIS. Como o governo Biden bem sabe, caso dê sinal verde para os drones israelenses atacarem instalações iranianas, esse ataque de drone não ficaria sem resposta do Irã.\nO governo Biden não ouviu os membros de suas próprias autoridades governamentais, um dos quais se demitiu em 3 de janeiro de 2024 , e muito menos as vozes dos 70% do povo americano que querem que os EUA pressionem o governo israelense a interromper seu genocídio em Gaza.\nO governo Biden está brincando com fogo e com a ameaça do uso de armas nucleares em suas políticas perigosas sobre Gaza, o Oriente Médio e o nordeste da Ásia.\nA diplomacia e o diálogo sobre questões dessas regiões deveriam ser prioritárias.\nAs ameaças de guerra deveriam acabar.\nCabe a nós, como cidadãos, salvarmo-nos a nós mesmos e ao nosso planeta da extinção nuclear causada por decisões políticas inexplicáveis de nossos “líderes”.\nCESSAR-FOGO AGORA – EM TODOS OS LUGARES!\nAnn Wright | Servidora por 29 anos no Exército dos EUA e na Reserva do Exército.

    "title": "How Air Pollution Alters Kids' Nasal Bacteria - Legal Reader",
    "text": "Air pollution doesn’t just harm children’s lungs — it changes the natural balance of bacteria in their noses, too. A recent study from Milan, Italy, followed school-age kids through winter and spring to track how the air they breathe affects their nasal microbiome. The researchers wanted to know how seasonal pollution impacts the tiny ecosystem of bacteria living in children’s noses, and what that might mean for their health.\nTo study this, children wore air-monitoring devices that measured pollutants like black carbon from car exhaust and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are often released from household products. The researchers took nasal swabs and compared the results between seasons. They found that in winter — when pollution levels were two to three times higher — the types and amounts of bacteria in the children’s noses shifted dramatically.\nIn the colder months, kids had more of a bacteria called Moraxella , which can cause infections and crowd out other helpful bacteria. At the same time, the variety of nasal bacteria went down. A less diverse mix of bacteria may make it easier for harmful microbes to grow and infections to take hold. This shift happened fast — even within hours of high pollution exposure. Spring samples told a different story. The kids’ nasal microbiomes became more balanced and diverse, with more of a generally harmless bacteria called Staphylococcus .\nPhoto by Marco Aurélio Conde on Unsplash The study also looked at how different pollutants affected bacterial makeup. Black carbon, mainly from diesel engines, was linked to fewer types of bacteria in both seasons. Meanwhile, VOCs — like those from scented cleaning products — had more targeted effects. One compound, limonene, which gives citrus cleaners their smell, reduced helpful bacteria like Neisseriaceae and entire groups like Actinobacteriota . Another VOC, methyl tert-butyl ether, seemed to increase certain bacteria tied to airway inflammation.\nWhat’s interesting is that indoor air pollutants had a big effect, too. Kids exposed to secondhand smoke at home had about 15% less variety in their nasal bacteria, even when outdoor air quality was the same. That’s a sign that what happens inside the home is just as important as what’s in the air outside. Many families may not realize that using strong cleaning sprays, lighting scented candles, or burning wood indoors can fill the air with invisible irritants that quietly shift a child’s natural defenses.\nThe takeaway is that children’s nasal microbiomes — which help filter the air and protect against illness — are sensitive to short bursts of pollution. And those shifts may set the stage for colds, asthma flares, and other respiratory problems. Because kids spend more time indoors in the winter and breathe more polluted air, their nasal bacteria get thrown off balance. Warmer months and cleaner air help restore it.\nParents can take simple steps to reduce these effects. Using less toxic cleaning products, avoiding indoor smoking, and keeping homes well-ventilated can help. Choosing routes to school with less traffic and supporting clean-air policies near schools can also protect kids. While more research is needed, this study shows that everyday air pollution doesn’t just stop at the lungs — it starts changing a child’s nose, hours after exposure. And that could shape how often they get sick, especially during the colder months when air is at its dirtiest.\nSources: Air pollution reshapes children’s nasal microbiome and reduces diversity in winter\nShort-term personal exposure to multiple air pollutants affects nasal microbiota in school-age children",
