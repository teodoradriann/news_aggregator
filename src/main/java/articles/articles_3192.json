    "text": "The Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation invited you to adopt your very own mangrove tree on Thursday.\nThe program allows volunteers to adopt and grow mangrove seedlings to help the island’s storm surge defense.\nKealy Pfau is wheeling out freshly grown mangroves at Sanibel’s Bailey preserve.\nThanks to the Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation’s coastal watch team, the trees are up for adoption. For the last four years, they’ve been growing an army of mangroves through the Adopt a Mangrove event.\nJohn McCormick volunteers each year.\n“Every year, I really enjoy seeing them get big,” said McCormick. “There’s a lot of areas around here that need them after all the storms we’ve had, especially after Ian.\nThat’s exactly why Coastal Watch hosts this event.\nAfter Hurricane Ian , mangrove numbers dwindled in parts of Sanibel.\nFoster parents, like McCormick, adopt seedlings to grow at home.\nWhen they bring the plants back, the mangroves are rooted to the storm surge front lines where they can grow up to 20 feet tall.\n“Mangroves are our first line of defense when we have tropical storm systems come through,” said Pfau. “They’re going to grow strong, get some good roots, and come back and protect our shorelines.”\nOver the past 4 years, the response to “Adopt a mangrove” has been huge, especially after Hurricane Ian, and that planted a seed of an idea for Pfau, the executive director of the Coastal Watch team.\n“After Ian, we saw a huge response from the community to want to get involved in this program. So we’ve been able to expand it. Last year, we adopted out over 1000 mangroves, and we’re hoping to do the same this year, if not more,” said Pfau.\nMangroves don’t just help buffer storm surge, they also provide habitat to many different fish, birds and mammals.\nSCCF is holding another Adopt a Mangrove event on October 24.\nIf you would like to find out how you can adopt a mangrove tree, click here .",

    "text": "The Ukrainian Intelligence has received evidence showing that the Russian military is planning to increase the number of assaults on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, says Spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, Vladyslav Voloshyn, UkrInform has reported.\nAccording to the information, Russian troops have received the necessary equipment for advancing. Moreover, the number of assaults has increased over the past few days.\n“The situation in Zaporizhzhia Oblast will most likely escalate along the front line. Yesterday, there were already five assaults, and there is a tendency for them to increase, as our intelligence reports that the enemy is gathering personnel for assault groups near Pryiutne .\nThe enemy has received 25 buggy vehicles from the reserve storage base of the Southern Military District of the Russian Federation. It indicates preparations for assault operations,” the spokesperson reported.\nVoloshyn noted that the situation on the southern front remains as tense as in the other directions. Over the past day, seven combat engagements have occurred in southern Ukraine, five of which were reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.\nCombat engagements took place near Robotyne and Nova Andriivka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and near the islands in the Dnipro River close to Kherson. The Russian army also conducted airstrikes with guided bombs, fired artillery, and launched kamikaze drone strikes.\nCurrently, the Russians are conducting reconnaissance with assault groups of up to ten soldiers, the spokesperson stated.\n“Their tactic is to quickly cover the distance between trenches, between the front lines, and to establish themselves in our trenches,” he explained.\nVoloshyn added that the Russian military does not face a shortage of shells during its military operations.\nRelated:\nRussia bombs Zaporizhzhia, injuring 16 civilians, including a 15-year-old Kharkiv residential area hit by FAB-250 bomb, 21 locals injured Deadly Russian missile strike kills 3 civilians, including child, in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Ukraine intercepts all 42 Russian drones; other Russian attacks kill four, injure 20 civilians in four regions Ukraine repels massive Russian explosive drone assault, destroying 71/80 Shaheds You could close this page.

Netanyahu afirmou que aceitar esse acordo, iria manter o grupo no poder e isso representaria uma ameaça para Israel.",

    "text": "How long does it take after diagnosis to start chemo? How many appts do you have to talk about chemo?\nThey confirmed I would need chemo last week as my her2 results came back positive. Had an MRI also last week to determine how big the lump is and wether to have surgery or chemo first.\nIf you have surgery first how long after you’ve had surgery will you start chemo?\nFrom your first day of chemo how long till you started to feel unwell?\nHi\nIt depends on your NHS Trust as some will have slightly more delay than others but, if they do decide on chemo first (called neo-adjuvant chemo, ie before surgery), it will be quick. I was in the chemo chair 2 weeks after my diagnosis/official results - also HER2+. Great to get the treatment so quickly but it doesn't give you a lot of time to get your head round it. Chemo wasn't really what I expected, in that I could function more than I thought I'd be able to and lead a normal life for much of it. Yes, some of it was yucky but they will give you medication to counteract nearly any side effect you might encounter.\nAll the best,\nLinda x\nPatience and faith\nIf you you go on July chemo group I have done daily updates following my 1st chemo.. currently 3 days after 2nd ..but remember everyone is different\nI had surgery on 23rd November and started chemo on 4th Jan, but I think the Christmas, New Year break slowed things down a little.\nIt depends upon the chemo regime you are having. I had fec-t. I sailed through fec, no problems. On T, I started to feel unwell (like a bad case of flu where everything aches) from about days 3/4 till days 9/10,\nBut everyone is different. My friend struggled through fec feeling nauseous but was ok on T. You just never know!\nIf you get achey you can take painkillers and there are antisickness tablets for nausea. So please don't worry.

Recognized not just for his entrepreneurial success but also for his profound impact on the community, Landoll's story is one of generosity, innovation, and steadfast dedication.\nGenerosity Beyond Business\nOne of the most touching moments of the evening came when Michelle Boss Brent, a testament to Landoll's philanthropy, shared her story.

For 14 years, Don Landoll personally flew her to her appointments, a gesture that she credits with significantly improving her quality of life. \"I truly do not think I'd be walking today if not for their care. And I owe that opportunity to one man, and that's Don Landoll,\" she expressed, highlighting the depth of Landoll's commitment to helping those in need.\nA Legacy of Innovation and Service\nDon Landoll's contributions extend beyond his philanthropic efforts. Under his leadership, Landoll Company, LLC has flourished, recently celebrating its 60th anniversary. As a pivotal figure in the farm equipment industry and a longstanding member of FEMA since 1972, Landoll's innovations have significantly impacted agricultural practices and machinery. His vision and dedication to quality have established Landoll Company as a revered name in the sector, embodying the spirit of American entrepreneurship and ingenuity.\nImpact and Reflection\nThe accolades received by Don Landoll at the Marysville Chamber of Commerce Annual Banquet are a testament to his multifaceted impact on the community and industry. Through his business acumen, Landoll has fostered economic growth and innovation. However, it is his unwavering commitment to philanthropy that truly sets him apart. His actions remind us that success is not solely measured by financial achievements but also by the ability to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFTS) — Inside Amalie Arena, Frank Coppola's eyes gleam from the stands as the team dives into a Thursday morning practice. \"This is fantastic,\" Coppola said to no one in particular. On the big screen above the team, a welcome sign to Frank flashes. \"I am so happy to be here because I'm a Bolts fan. And I used to be a Penguins fan. But I've switched now. I'm a Bolts fan,\" he smiled. He and a hand full of other patients at Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute received the special invitation to 'Day with the Bolts,' a chance to get an up close and personal experience with the Lightning. \"We want to be able to give our patients something to look forward to and something to just be able to take their mind off of the journey that they're going through health wise, even if it's just for a couple of hours,\" said Kat Wade, the Director of Marketing. Coppola is undergoing treatment with the Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute for kidney disease. Yet, Coppola doesn't see that as a deterrent for his plans. \"I'm gonna hang out. I'm gonna be the last World War II veteran,\" he said. In fact, he'll turn 100 on March 9th. And what a century it's been. He received a Purple Heart from an injury sustained during Battle of the Bulge. \"Shrapnel I guess. I never saw it hit me. But that made a big, big hole here in my leg. It was nothing really. I almost said that I don't need a Purple Heart, my God. I had it worse playing football,\" he joked. After the war, he found a new passion on the stage. \"I performed Fiddler on the Roof in Clearwater. 12 shows there. And that was the most fun that I ever had in the in the show business,\" he smiled. If you ask Coppola his secret to longevity, he'll tell you it's all about rolling with the inevitable punches life throws at everyone. \"My Secret to being 100 is singing and being happy. And being nice to people. Because the more you're nice to people, the more they're nicer to you. I think that I've been very fortunate. One thing about getting this age that's not so beautiful; when you lose all your family, your wife's family, and all your friends. You got to make new ones,\" he said. Now he has the opportunity to make new friends. He's been invited to help sing the National Anthem at the Bolts March 2nd game. An invitation he's taking great pride in.",

    "title": "Come conservare i limoni per averli tutto l’anno",
    "text": "Quanti limoni sprechiamo, tutti i giorni. Eppure, specie quelli made in Italy , non costano poco: ma dimentichiamo che il limone, come qualsiasi agrume, va a male, o comunque, se non sappiamo conservarlo in qualche modo utile, non è più utilizzabile . Cambia colore e connotati, per poi marcire. Perde succo e sapore, cioè qualità. Si ricopre con macchie di muffa. Dunque, considerando che i limoni li usiamo, e non solo in cucina, tutto l’anno, è bene imparare a conservarli in modo corretto . I limoni arrivano spesso durante l’anno, e non abbiamo bisogno di farne scorte particolari. Piuttosto, se non lo abbiamo tagliato e iniziato a consumare, il limone non va messo in frigorifero (a meno che non sia molto maturo): basta conservarlo in un ambiente fresco, dove circoli l’aria. Durerà molto a lungo, e quando lo mangeremo non avrà perso la sua freschezza.\nLimone tagliato Avrete notato anche voi che, se tagliate a metà un limone e ne utilizzate solo una parte, la restante metà, anche se conservata in frigorifero , a contatto con l’aria tende ad ammuffirsi. Per risolvere il problema, riponete il limone tagliato, con la parte interna capovolta in un bicchiere con un pò di acqua fredda e lasciatelo in frigorifero. In questo modo, il limone si manterrà fresco per una settimana. Un altro buon sistema è quello di tagliare i limoni a spicchi e poi congelarli negli appositi sacchetti. Un’altra possibilità è di mettere il limone avanzato sopra un piattino di ceramica dalla parte tagliata, e conservare in frigorifero. Resterà fresco molto a lungo.\nBuccia di limone Per conservare la buccia del limone, a voi la scelta se grattugiarla o essiccarla :\nBuccia del limone grattugiata : dopo aver grattugiato la buccia, possibilmente senza la parte bianca un po’ amara, riponetela in un contenitore ermetico e conservatela in freezer. Quando vi occorrerà non dovrete far altro che prelevare la quantità giusta e riporre nuovamente il contenitore in freezer. Buccia di limone essiccata : per essiccare le bucce di limone basta cuocerle in forno a 60° per circa 2 ore. In questo modo perderanno la parte acquosa. Conservatele negli appositi sacchetti per alimenti.\nSucco di limone Conservare il succo di limone è molto semplice: basta riporlo negli stampini del ghiaccio. Un sistema in perfetto stile “Non sprecare” che vi permetterà anche di utilizzarne, di volta in volta, la giusta quantità, senza sprechi.\nCome conservare il limone in freezer Contrariamente a quanto si pensa, conservare in freezer bucce e succo di limone, con il metodo molto semplice che abbiamo indicato, significa non perdere le loro proprietà nutrizionali. A partire dalla vitamina C . Nella buccia del limone, ricordiamolo, la quantità di vitamina C è 10 volte superiore a quella della polpa. Congelandola, possiamo utilizzarla e beneficiare della sua percentuale di vitamina C, durante tutto l’anno.\nPerché i limoni non vanno in frigorifero Durante l’anno, i limoni non hanno bisogno del frigorifero. Rischiano solo di perdere il loro profumo e il loro sapore autentico. Cosa diversa, invece, per la stagione estiva: le temperature alte e anche la difficoltà di trovare limoni freschi, suggeriscono la soluzione di conservarli in frigo, dove sicuramente possono durare anche un paio di settimane.\nLeggi anche: Come coltivare i limoni nel vaso Tutti gli usi delle foglie di limone Ricette con i limoni: le più facili e veloci Pulizie di casa che si possono fare con il limone Iscriviti alla nostra newsletter per rimanere sempre aggiornato.
