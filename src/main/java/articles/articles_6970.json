    "title": "Koumala Hotel's resident cat banned from public bar, pool room by Mackay council - ABC News",
    "text": "Koumala Hotel's resident cat banned from public bar, pool room by Mackay council In short: The local council has told owners of the Koumala Hotel their resident cat can no longer be in the pool room or public bar. The senior Siamese named Precious spends most of her days sleeping on a couch. What's next? The publicans have to rehome Precious or find a way to work with council to exclude her from areas where food and drinks are served. She could well be 18 and old enough to be in the bar, but this lady is not welcome at her North Queensland local. Precious the Siamese cat has called the Koumala Hotel home for the past 14 years. But Mackay Regional Council says on a recent visit she was seen in the restaurant, a breach of food safety legislation. The Food Standards Code bans animals from bars and dining areas where food or drinks are served. Dogs, however, may be in outdoor dining areas. Pub owner Rowena Colgrave said the council initially gave her 14 days to find a new home for the cat. A petition for Precious to stay has gathered more than 2,000 signatures with offers of a new home coming from as far away as Sydney and Melbourne. Precious came with the pub when Ms Colgrave bought it eight years ago. \"Everyone has their own opinion on how long she's been here. She was an adult cat when she turned up, so she could have been 4 to 6 years old, so she could be anywhere up to 18 to 20 years old now,\" she said. Ms Colgrave said she misunderstood advice from council last year. \"I thought Precious was allowed to stay, as long as she was fed outside, but apparently she's not allowed in any place where people could be eating, and sometimes people eat in the pool room.\" She said it would be impossible to keep her upstairs or outside. Ms Colgrave said when she was younger she used to enjoy seeing Precious on the bar stool. \"Everyone would let her have that bar stool, and everyone would give her a pat as they walked past her, and she would be up there for hours. \"Since she's gotten older, she can't jump up onto a bar stool, so she's out in the pool room now.\" \"The law's the law, I suppose, but I just think it shouldn't be so black and white.\" \"A positive solution\" Council says it will work with the owners to find a fix. Community services director Janine McKay said the pub owners were told about the legislation a year ago. \"The issue was first flagged with the pub licensee more than a year ago, but the cat was seen again during a routine inspection of the premises this week,\" Ms McKay said. Councillor Marty Bella supports Precious being removed. \"The scales of justice shouldn't be blind. It's not a matter of which pub or which restaurant or how old the cat is. \"It's a matter of our food safety regulations and they are there for exactly that reason — for the safety of the wider public.\" Patron Dennis Cash said the old cat just sat around. \"If she gets a bit hot she goes outside. She's been here for 14 years,\" he said. \"She's too old to get up on the bar stool now. All she wants to do is live the rest of her life out, poor old cat.\" Tahra Carniato has worked at the Koumala Hotel for the last four years. She says she was confused at first when she heard Precious might have to be kept outside. \"As far as I know, the lady who was here before me was here for fourteen years, so to add that to [the time] Precious was already here for it just doesn't make sense why she isn't allowed to be in her home now,\" Ms Carniato said. \"She is getting old and you can see her starting to decline. \"You start thinking one day she might pass away, which is really sad. But to be taken away from the pub now, at the end of her life, I think that's the saddest part. \"I couldn't imagine not being with her until the end of her life, if you know what I mean. That makes me a bit sad.\"",

    "text": "Ask Chuck: Stewardship tips for a happy New Year Dear Chuck, Thank you for the lessons you bring us each week and how you tie them back to the Word of God. Please provide some tips to help my husband and me be better stewards in the new year ahead. Stewardship Tips Dear Stewardship Tips, Thank you so much. My wife, Ann, helps me research and respond to questions each week. We are grateful for your kind words. We can share some of the tips that have helped us. Pray, reflect, give thanks I suggest you find a place and time that is free of distractions so you can ponder and pray deeply. Ask the Lord for help to reflect on the past year — to recall specific ways in which He has helped, guided, or provided in ways you never could have imagined. [Hebrews 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12&version=ESV) is an excellent way to begin the process of reflection. It reminds us to remember with reverence and awe how God provides and sustains us through the years. Look back through your calendar or journal for prompts. There may have been days of deep sorrow or great joy. In both, we are told to give thanks because God uses them to sanctify us and conform us to His image. Ann and I often refer to Lamentations 3:21–24 upon rising in the morning. We go back and forth, reciting the phrases. It is a good one to think about in reflecting over the past year: But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: \"The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. ‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul, ‘therefore I will hope in him.’” It’s a valuable practice to recall the ways we experience God’s love and mercy and praise Him for His faithfulness. It enables us to look to the future with renewed hope. A stewardship analysis: Money, motives, and management Set aside a few hours and review your earnings, spending, giving, saving, and investing over the past twelve months. This will prepare you to do some analysis. Make a rough draft, then copy it in a journal or place that you can refer to in days/years to come. Access it frequently to remember God’s work in your life. Imagine keeping decades of reflections to pass down to loved ones. Don’t rush. In fact, you may recall things that you need to record in days to come. Your family may want to participate and share their reflections together. - What significant changes occurred in earning, spending, giving, saving, or investing money? - Are there areas where you need to improve or make adjustments? - Did you create any new debt? - Do you have a plan to pay it off? - Are you making financial decisions based on a temporal or eternal perspective? - In what ways did you experience God’s discipline, protection, love, and compassion? - What Biblical financial truth guided you this year? - What hard thing did you have to trust God with? What did you learn? How did you grow? - Is there anything in your life that needs to be surrendered? If so, [transfer ownership](https://www.crown.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/YL-Transfer-of-Owndership.pdf)now. - In what ways did you manage resources differently from other years? - What did you accomplish financially that you are especially excited about? - Did you make any lifestyle changes? If so, what? How did they impact your financial well-being? - Were you fully transparent with your spouse about money? If not, humble yourself and act on it. - Are there any poor uses of money that you should repent of and pray for strength to overcome? - Do you have wise counselors who give you honest advice before making large financial decisions? If not, who can you recruit to help you next year? - Is there someone — in addition to God — to thank for impacting your financial well-being? - What is a single financial goal for the New Year that you agree needs to be accomplished? Give thanks After reflecting on the year and God’s faithfulness, pause and thank God. The phrase “Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever” is repeated in the Bible and should be repeated by us throughout our days. See [1 Chronicles 16:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+16%3A34&version=NIV); [2 Chronicles 5:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+5%3A13&version=NIV); [Psalm 106:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+106%3A1&version=NIV); [Psalm 107:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+107%3A1&version=NIV); [Psalm 118:1, 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+118&version=NIV); [Psalm 136:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+136%3A1&version=NIV); [Jeremiah 33:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2033%3A11&version=NIV) Ask Him to guide you in the New Year We all make financial mistakes, experience unwanted hardships, and need God’s wisdom to make progress daily. With every new year the Lord gives us to live, we can start fresh with renewed hope and dreams for serving His purposes as good and faithful stewards. For Ann and me, our financial journey started fresh after 21 years of marriage. For the past 24 years, we have been blessed to have seen God redeem us from so many mistakes early in our marriage and have the joy of learning and applying His financial principles. I hope you will look to Crown for resources to help you in this exciting journey. Happy New Year.

    "text": "El voraz incendio que estalló la tarde del lunes en el Cercado de Lima sigue desafiando a cientos de bomberos voluntarios, quienes llevan más de 48 horas batallando contra las llamas en una zona histórica marcada por construcciones antiguas y almacenes clandestinos.\nLo que comenzó en el último piso de un edificio de seis niveles, donde se almacenaban juguetes de plástico sin permisos oficiales, se ha convertido en un siniestro de proporciones alarmantes que amenaza con prolongarse hasta el domingo 9 de marzo, según estimaciones del Cuerpo General de Bomberos Voluntarios del Perú.\nEl comandante territorial de Lima y Callao, Alfonso Panizo, describió la situación como \"extremadamente complicada\" debido al diseño laberíntico del área afectada.\n\"No podemos llegar al corazón del fuego. El 70% de las llamas sigue intacto, sin una gota de agua que lo toque\", confesó.\nLee también Se desata incendio en Hospital General de Haití tras ataque de bandas armadas; se desconoce los daños ocasionados\nHasta ahora, seis edificaciones han sido alcanzadas por el incendio, cuatro de ellas reducidas a escombros y una parcialmente colapsada, mientras drones sobrevuelan la zona para evaluar el daño.\nEl enemigo: agua escasa y materiales inflamables\nLa falta de acceso y el bajo caudal de agua han convertido esta emergencia en una carrera contrarreloj. Los bomberos han improvisado piscinas para acumular el recurso traído por cisternas de Sedapal, pero el brigadier mayor Carlos Malpica, de los bomberos voluntarios, explicó a Andina que \"el agua se agota en dos o tres minutos\".\nEntre 250 y 300 efectivos por turno trabajan sin descanso, aplicando una estrategia defensiva para contener el avance del fuego hacia áreas sensibles, como la cercana maternidad de Lima, que por ahora no ha sido afectada por el humo.\nSin embargo, el riesgo no termina ahí. En los almacenes informales, clausurados en el pasado pero reabiertos mediante medidas cautelares, se acumulan productos inflamables que alimentan las llamas y elevan la posibilidad de explosiones o más derrumbes.\n\"Es un polvorín disfrazado de almacén\", señaló un testigo en el lugar, mientras maquinaria pesada abría brechas en las paredes para facilitar el ingreso de agua.\nLee también Apagón afecta Buenos Aires; servicio eléctrico se restablece parcialmente\nRespuesta oficial y el impacto en la ciudad\nLa municipalidad de Lima evacuó a residentes en peligro, y el Ministerio de Salud instaló un puesto médico para atender a los 17 lesionados por inhalación de humo, dos de los cuales requirieron traslado a centros hospitalarios.\nMientras tanto, el Ministerio del Ambiente monitorea la calidad del aire, que se dispersa favorablemente gracias a las condiciones meteorológicas, aliviando temores en distritos como Rímac y San Juan de Lurigancho.\nEl fuego, que ha devorado construcciones históricas y almacenes repletos de mercancía, expone una vez más las fallas en la fiscalización de actividades informales en el centro de la capital peruana.\nLee también Incendio en Japón deja un muerto y miles de evacuados; es uno de los más devastadores en décadas\nMario Casaretto, representante de la municipalidad, admitió que los almacenes operaban sin autorización, un problema recurrente que ahora cobra un alto precio.\nCon el humo aún elevándose sobre el cielo limeño y el sonido de las sirenas resonando en las calles, los bomberos advierten que el control total del incendio podría demorar días.\nLo que comenzó como un incidente aislado ya es un recordatorio del peligro latente en el corazón de la ciudad, donde la historia, la informalidad y la tragedia se entrelazan entre las cenizas. Por ahora, Lima contiene la respiración, a la espera de que las llamas cedan.\n*Con información de El Comercio y EFE\ndesa/mgm",

    "title": "LeBron James Investigated by IOC for Performance-Enhancing Drugs?",
    "text": "As the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team advanced in the\n2024 Paris Olympics, an online rumor alleged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched an investigation into NBA star LeBron James for using performance-enhancing drugs, specifically naming a supposed weight-loss product called Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies.\nHowever, this rumor was false. Further, it's connected to a dangerous and long-running scam promoting keto gummies for weight loss.\nThe LeBron James Scam Began in Facebook Ads\nThe rumor, or scam, appeared in several Facebook advertisements in early August. One ad displayed a photo of James with the words \"We Say Goodbye.\" The text of the ad read, \"LeBron Might Sit Out After Paris\" and \"This 'Booster' turned up in his locker.\"\nAs we have previously\nreported, similar Facebook and Instagram ads target celebrities — such as Oprah Winfrey, Kelly Clarkson and others — by falsely saying they have endorsed keto gummies, purportedly for weight loss.\nIn reality, no famous people have ever endorsed any products described as keto gummies for weight loss.\nFake ESPN Article Promoted LeBron James Scam\nThe link in the Facebook ads directed users to a fake ESPN\narticle ( archived) hosted on the scam website greenteamgt.com. The headline read, \"Questions Surround LeBron James As Investigation Dives Into His 'Performance Enhancers.'\"\nESPN never published this page. It was a fictional story. The article, with its many false claims about James' supposed use of Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies, began, in part:\n(ESPN) - With a total of 4 NBA championships and 2 Olympic medals under his belt at the age of 39, there is no doubt that LeBron James is one of the greatest basketball players of our time. However, his most recent blood test is raising eyebrows within the Olympic Commission.\nAccording to the report, his Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) was incredibly high, indicating a higher resting metabolism, and he had an outrageously high Resting Energy Expenditure (REE). What does this mean to someone without a doctorate in Health Science? According to his charts James is somehow able to burn calories at 145% higher than average.\nJames credits his incredible metabolism to the popular supplement, Rapid Lean, a popular weight loss product, that has yet to be banned by the Olympics.\nFor the average user, Rapid Lean is a product that is purported to be highly a effective weight loss supplement, but in the hands of a pro athlete, the results appear to be a complete game changer.\nWhen asked about the controversy surrounding Rapid Lean, James responded with this:\n\"I understand the concern people have, but Rapid Lean is not a dangerous performance enhancer. It's simply a natural product that helps me boost energy and burn fat. And frankly, more people need to know about it.\"\nAgain, James never made any of the statements mentioned in the fake ESPN article.\nAbout the Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies Scam Website\nLinks in the fake ESPN article directed users to another scam page hosted on\nrapidleanbrands.com. That page falsely claimed CBS News, NBC, CNN, Women's Health, Dr. Mehmet Oz and other prominent sources provided favorable reviews of the purported gummies.\nThe same page also misleadingly advertised \"free\" bottles of the gummies — when, in reality, any user who signed up would receive charges amounting to hundreds of dollars as part of a monthly subscription.\nThe Rapid Lean Keto + ACV Gummies website listed (855) 485-8926 as a phone number and care@buyrapidlean.com as an email address. The website featured in the email address —\nbuyrapidlean.com — listed its \"location\" as a mailbox inside a UPS Store in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.\nHistorically, customer service personnel assigned to field inquiries from victims of these scams follow scripts. Those scripts generally only offer a 50% refund to customers asking for money back. Readers who fall victim to these scams should contact their credit card company to alert them to the scam, ask if it's possible to obtain a full refund and block future recurring charges from the same seller.\nFTC Takes Action Against Alleged Gummy Scammers\nOn July 1, weeks before these scam ads started circulating on Facebook, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced in a\nnews release its action against \"two related groups\" that allegedly defrauded consumers nationwide by signing them up for similar recurring charges without their consent. It's unclear if, or to what extent, they included creators of the scam targeting James.\nThe release began:\nA U.S. district court in central Florida today unsealed a Federal Trade Commission complaint charging two related groups of defendants with defrauding consumers nationwide by enrolling them, without their knowledge, into continuity plans where they are shipped and charged repeatedly for personal care products that they did not agree to purchase.\nThe defendants allegedly deceived consumers with ads for \"free\" CBD and Keto-related personal care products, billing many for products they did not consent to purchase, signing many up for unwanted continuity plans, and debiting money from their bank accounts without prior authorization. In addition, the FTC alleges that some of the defendants laundered credit card payments by setting up bank accounts for shell companies using straw signers.\n\"These defendants bilked consumers out of millions of dollars by repeatedly charging them for products they never ordered or agreed to purchase,\" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC is committed to aggressively pursuing companies and individuals involved in these unauthorized billing scams.\"\nWe will update this story if we uncover any further information about the complaint and/or scam targeting James.",

    "title": "Zelensky expresa su \"gratitud\" al Papa por sus \"deseos de paz\" para Ucrania: \"Estoy agradecido al Vaticano\"",
    "text": "ROMA, 29 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) - El presidente de Ucrania, Volodimir Zelenski, ha expresado este viernes su \"gratitud\" al Papa por sus \"deseos de paz\" para Ucrania, según 'Vatican News'. \"Acabo de hablar con Su Santidad el Papa Francisco para expresarle mi gratitud por sus deseos navideños para Ucrania y los ucranianos, por sus deseos de paz, una paz justa para todos nosotros. Hemos hablado de nuestro trabajo conjunto sobre la Fórmula de la Paz: más de 80 Estados participan ya a nivel de sus representantes. Habrá más. Estoy agradecido al Vaticano por apoyar nuestro trabajo\", ha asegurado en un mensaje en la red social X (antes Twitter). Precisamente, el Papa ha recibido en varias ocasiones al presidente ucraniano en el Vaticano. La última, el pasado 13 de mayo, en el que fue su segundo encuentro en persona tras el de 2020, el primero desde la invasión rusa de Ucrania. En todo caso, desde el atentado del 24 de febrero de 2022, se han producido varias conversaciones telefónicas entre el Papa y Zelensky. La primera fue el 26 de febrero del año pasado, dos días después del inicio del conflicto. En esta ocasión, el Papa expresó su \"más profundo dolor\" por los \"trágicos\" acontecimientos que estaban teniendo lugar en el país, mientras que el presidente afirmó cómo el pueblo ucraniano sentía el \"apoyo espiritual\" del Papa. Así, el 22 de marzo de 2022 Zelensky le trasladó \"la difícil situación humanitaria y el bloqueo de los corredores de socorro por las fuerzas rusas\", para añadir que acogía \"con satisfacción el papel mediador de la Santa Sede para poner fin al sufrimiento humano\". Finalmente, el 12 de agosto de 2022, el presidente ucraniano afirmó que hablaron \"de los horrores sufridos por la población a causa de la invasión rusa\".",
