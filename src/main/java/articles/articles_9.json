    "text": "The Indian Army has mobilised its columns across key locations in Himachal Pradesh to deliver relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood in the states Mandi district. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu visited the districts Thunag area to assess the relief operations and shared photos of his visit in a post on X on Thursday. A brigade commander of the army is in Mandi for an operational update and interaction with the forces columns. A meeting with the chief minister and Mandis deputy commissioner is also planned, he said. The army has deployed relief columns across Mandi, including in Thunag, Bagsiad and Pandoh. Its efforts are bolstered by the involvement of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and local authorities. The Indian Army remains committed to supporting the citizens of Himachal Pradesh during this crisis and continues to stand by the civil administration in this time of need, the brigadier said. Since the onset of monsoon on June 20, Himachal Pradesh has received 30 per cent of excess rain, and has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 740 crore, as 31 flash floods, 22 cloudbursts, and 17 landslides claimed several lives and damaged buildings, crop fields and forests. Fifteen people died and five were injured, while a search is on to trace the 27 people who went missing after 10 cloudbursts, followed by flash floods and a landslide hit Mandi on the intervening night of June 30 and July 1. At least 1,184 houses suffered extensive damage, while 780 livestock perished in the disaster. The army columns are striving to open vital routes. A critical mule track from Bagsiad to Thunag was successfully cleared on July 6, enabling the delivery of essential supplies, the officer said. Affected families in Thunag are being given medical assistance, provisions of first aid, and ration kits. In partnership with civil administration, the army has ensured delivery of relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood. And, aid has already reached Degi (July 7), Rushad (July 8), and Chapad (July 9), the officer said. All columns are in communication via mobile networks, with limited coverage at some locations, like Thunag. Satellite communications, including ISAT phone and other key communication systems, have been provided to ensure uninterrupted operational connectivity, the army said. In response to a spell of heavy rain and urban flooding in the northeast India, the Indian Army has launched extensive relief measures under Operation Jal Rahat 2, with deployment across Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur.These efforts are being led by Headquarters Inspector General Assam Rifles (North) or HQ IGAR (N) in collaboration with local authorities. On July 10, the Dimapur deputy commissioner formally requisitioned assistance from the Indian Army to provide immediate flood relief in Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas in Nagaland, an official said. The army swiftly responded with the deployment of an Engineer Task Force (ETF) team, he said. While a verbal de-requisition was received later in the day, the army remains on standby with resources mobilised through the Flood Relief Control Centre at HQ IGAR (N), the official added. In Upper Assam, the Dhansiri River in Golaghat district has breached the danger level. The army said, although the water level is now receding, the force continues to monitor the situation closely. In Manipur, the Nambol River flowing through Imphal West and Bishnupur districts has also surpassed danger levels. While the floodwater has begun to recede, the army remains actively engaged in relief operations, another official said. As of July 10, the Indian Army has deployed 40 relief columns (24 main and 16 reserve) across the region, the person said. A total of 3,820 people have since been rescued, over 1,360 food packets distributed, medical aid provided to 2,095 individuals, and 15,421 water bottles supplied to aid affected people, the army official said.",

    "text": "Published: Jan. 31, 2025, 1:03 a.m.\nDear Abby\nBy Abigail Van Buren\nDEAR ABBY: My husband has a female friend he grew up with. They have exchanged “happy birthday” texts for many years. However, they have recently begun texting more often. An example: One night he was mixing a drink and texted her about whether to use Pepsi or Coke.\nOn his birthday, I watched for her text and saw it had two heart emojis on either side of her message. This bothered me a great deal, and I told him his flirting via texting needed to stop. He says I’m being unreasonable and he is doing nothing wrong. This has caused a rift between us.\nAbby, AM I unreasonable? I did see a therapist who said my husband has an emotional relationship with this woman and I had every right to be upset. The therapist also said he should stop because I am his wife and he sees how much this upsets me. My husband’s response? “Well, you told the therapist YOUR side of the story.” We have been married 18 years and together for 24. He is a good partner, and I do love him. What is your advice? -- SUSPICIOUS IN IOWA\nDEAR SUSPICIOUS: Your husband had a point when he said your therapist has heard only one side of the story. You have been married to a “good partner” for 18 years and together for 24. If your husband hasn’t shown signs of straying before, it’s unlikely he’s doing anything more than communicating with an old friend. Hearts included in a text message may seem effusive, but they aren’t necessarily declarations of romantic love. Some joint sessions with an unbiased marriage and family therapist may help to calm your fears. I heartily recommend it.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips. Contact Dear Abby at www.DearAbby.com or P.O.

    "title": "How property tax hikes will impact commercial real estate",
    "text": "Property taxes are likely to rise in Minneapolis and St. Paul following budget proposals from the mayors of both cities that included property tax levy increases of about 8%. A tax increase is likely to have a bigger impact on owners of industrial and residential properties in the Twin Cities, as many office buildings suffer from low occupancy and falling property values. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter presented a budget that would require a 7.9% property tax levy increase during his Tuesday speech, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey proposed an 8.1% property tax levy increase at his Wednesday speech. Andrew Babula, the director of the real estate program at the University of St. Thomas, said office buildings in the downtown cores are facing two pressures when it comes to property taxes — a downward pressure on market value as a result of rising vacancies while the levy amount is an upward pressure. “It just depends on which one has a bigger effect,” Babula said. “I think it will vary by each building because certain office properties, particularly those that haven’t been as successful in maintaining occupancy — usually that’s going to be older properties, not as well positioned, that don’t have amenities.” Though a building with 8% to 10% property tax levy increase paired with a 25% to 40% drop in market value, Babula said property taxes overall are still likely to go down. In a statement given to Finance & Commerce, BOMA Minneapolis President Sarah Anderson said a property tax increase in Minneapolis along with historic difficulties in the commercial real estate space such as “sky-high interest rates” is cause for concern because it will impact “our ability to recover and be viable.” “We hope in the coming months, city leaders will develop a budget that recognizes these challenges and focuses on efforts to bring vibrancy to our community,” Anderson said. Cecil Smith, the president of the Minnesota Multi Housing Association said in a Wednesday interview that there is “a real nervousness” among landlords about property tax increases in both cities, but across the metro broadly. “Housing providers have seen really significant inflationary effects on their operations, insurance, wages, property taxes,” Smith said, adding that the market has brought sluggish rent growth. “Property tax increases coming down for next year, that’s going to be very difficult to manage.” How property taxes shift throughout the metro is likely dependent on the size of the city, Babula said. Minneapolis and St. Paul are uniquely at risk because their downtown cores have so much office space. “Still, suburbs will still feel an impact and their budgets are smaller, but on a percentage basis, they could be seeing similar impacts,” Babula said. This move by Carter and Frey is not unexpected. In May during his State of the City address, Frey said the drop in value among office buildings downtown has led to a budget shortfall and he warned this year was not one to “add shiny new programs” but rather to utilize the existing ones. Frey said during his Wednesday speech that the maintenance of current programs was initially estimated to require a double-digit increase, something he called “acceptable to nobody.” For St. Paul specifically, Babula said the likely reason for needing such an increase to the levy, its likely to offset inflation which has driven up the cost of city services as well as to account for the city spending more on housing programs and downtown revitalization efforts. Carter, during his speech, made the argument for spending on the “All-In Housing” framework of investments like expanding downpayment assistance and supporting the study of office-to-multifamily conversions.
