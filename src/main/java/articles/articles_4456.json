Prof. Dr Neak Chandarith, director of the Institute for International Studies and Public Policy under the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP).\nAssoc.Prof.Dr Neak Chandarith, Director of the Institute for International Studies and Public Policy under the Royal University of Phnom Penh The Vietnamese State leader’s visits to Laos and Cambodia, his first overseas trips since taking office, demonstrates the Vietnamese side’s strategic priority of developing ties with the neighbouring countries in its external policy.\nThe visit to Cambodia will serve to create a chance for the leader to engage in discussions at the highest level, thereby helping to strengthening joint ties and co-operation in a multitude of areas, he said. He added that both sides will exchange their views on and seek solutions on issues of shared concern.\nPresident To Lam will lay wreaths at the Independence Monument and the Cambodia – Vietnam Friendship Monument nearby which affirms the country’s respect for its traditional and historical relations with Cambodia, the official said.\nThe Vietnamese President’s visit is also designed to intensify people-to-people exchanges and citizen diplomacy, thereby helping to strengthen mutual understanding between the two peoples, stressing that both sides have worked to preserve their sound neighbourliness, comprehensive co-operation, and time-tested friendship over recent years.\nThe Cambodian scholar said that the two sides should maintain regular delegation exchanges at all levels and form dialogue mechanisms in order to discuss priorities and share practical experience. This should be done while ramping up collaboration in domains such as the economy, science, technology and innovation, education and training, climate change response, energy, the environment, and health care.\nVOV",

    "text": "US President Joe Biden. (Photo: EPA-EFE / Shawn Thew) By Reuters Follow Following 02 Feb 2024 Follow Following 3 US President Joe Biden issued an executive order on Thursday that aims to punish Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians envisage a future state. The Biden administration on Thursday imposed sanctions on four Israeli men it accused of being involved in settler violence in the West Bank, signalling growing US displeasure with the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order on Thursday that aims to punish Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians envisage a future state.\nThe order establishes a system for imposing financial sanctions and visa restrictions against individuals who attack or intimidate Palestinians or seize their property, said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.\n“Today’s actions seek to promote peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” he said.\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Israel-Palestine War\nUnited Nations figures show that daily settler attacks have more than doubled in the nearly four months since Hamas carried out an attack on Israel on 7 October, and Israel responded with an assault on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.\nThe State Department sanctions freeze the US assets of the four men and generally bar Americans from dealing with them. A State Department statement said:\nDavid Chai Chasdai initiated and led a riot that included setting vehicles and buildings on fire and causing damage to property in Huwara, resulting in the death of a Palestinian civilian. Einan Tanjil assaulted Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by attacking them with stones and clubs, resulting in injuries that required medical treatment. Shalom Zicherman, according to video evidence, assaulted Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank, blocking them on the street, attempted to break the windows of passing vehicles with activists inside, and cornered at least two of the activists and injured both. Yinon Levi led a group of settlers that assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, burnt their fields and destroyed their property. “Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a separate statement.\nTwo-state solution “The United States will continue to take actions to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution, and is committed to the safety, security and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\nBiden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.\nBiden has raised the issue directly with Netanyahu, said one senior official, as Biden seeks a path to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians once the Gaza conflict ends. Netanyahu, who heads a religious-rightist coalition, has resisted US entreaties to develop a plan for post-conflict Gaza and to embrace a peace deal that envisages Israeli and Palestinian states side by side.\nHis office on Thursday responded to the US steps by saying they were unnecessary.\n“Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,” it said.\nThe West Bank, among the territories along with Gaza where Palestinians seek statehood, has experienced a surge of violence in recent months amid expanding Jewish settlements and a nearly decade-old impasse in US-sponsored peacemaking.\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, head of the far-right pro-settlement party Religious Zionism, was defiant in a statement on the Biden order:\n“The ‘settler violence’ campaign is an anti-Semitic lie that enemies of Israel disseminate with the goal of smearing the pioneering settlers and settlement enterprise, and to harm them and thus smear the entire State of Israel,” Smotrich said.\nIn December, the US began imposing visa bans on people involved in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nSince the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. It has built Jewish settlements there that most countries deem illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical ties to the land.\nHamas fighters killed 1,200 people and captured 253 hostages on 7 October, precipitating an Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza. Health officials in the enclave said on Thursday the confirmed death toll had risen above 27,000, with thousands more dead still lying under the rubble.
