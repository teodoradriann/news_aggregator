    "title": "New laws set to take effect on July 1, including gun restrictions and housing regulations",
    "text": "Several bills that were passed during the 2024 legislative session and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis will take effect on July 1. Here are a few of the most significant pieces of legislation set to become effective in just a few days: [SB 131](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sB24-131): Prohibit Carrying Firearms in Sensitive Spaces This bill is one of the most contentious of the 2024 session. The bill prohibits the carrying of firearms, concealed or otherwise, in a number of locations considered \"sensitive spaces,\" including government buildings, child care centers, and public schools. In a recent interview with Colorado Politics, John Kellner, district attorney for the 18th Judicial District, said his concern with the new law is that the penalty for unlawfully carrying a gun onto school grounds was decreased in the bill's language. Kellner questions the \"tough on gun\" messaging when the new law will make carrying a gun on school grounds a lesser offense. Under SB 131, a violation of the law is considered a Class 1 misdemeanor. Before, Kellner, who is not running for reelection this year, said it was a felony to carry any weapon on school grounds, noting that now a person carrying a knife on school grounds will be penalized more heavily than someone caught with a gun. While the misdemeanor charge is one step down from the Class 6 felony the offense was before, it does change the penalties. Before, a person caught with a gun could face over a year in prison and up to $100,000 in fines. Under SB 131, someone caught carrying a gun on school grounds faces a shorter jail sentence and a maximum of $1,000 in fines. The bill was sponsored by Sens. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, D-Lafayette, Chris Hansen, D-Denver, and Reps. Kyle Brown, D-Louisville, and Mandy Lindsay, D-Aurora.

[HB 1007](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1007): Prohibit Residential Occupancy Limits This bill prohibits local governments from limiting the number of unrelated people who can live together in a single household, with several exceptions. Residential occupancy limits can still be enforced if they are necessary to uphold health and safety standards or to comply with local, federal, or political subdivision affordable housing guidelines. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Manny Rutinel, D-Commerce City, and Javier Mabrey, D-Denver, and Sens. Tony Exum, D-Denver, and Julie Gonzales, D-Denver.

[HB 1147](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1147): Candidate Election Deepfake Disclosures This bill regulates the use of deepfake images, videos, and audio in communications about candidates for elected office. It mandates that any manipulated media about a candidate must include a disclosure statement indicating that it has been altered. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Junie Joseph, D-Boulder, and Brianna Titone, D-Arvada, and Sens. Chris Hansen, D-Denver, and Janet Buckner, D-Aurora.

[HB 1081](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1081): Regulate Sale Transfer Sodium Nitrite This bill prohibits the sale and transfer of products containing sodium nitrite in concentrations greater than 10%. While sodium nitrite is commonly used as a food additive and preservative in small concentrations, highly concentrated forms of the compound have become an increasingly popular method of suicide in recent years. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Judy Amabile, D-Boulder, and Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, and Sens. Dylan Roberts, D-Frisco, and Byron Pelton, R-Sterling Read more about the bill [here](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/legislature/colorado-lawmakers-say-regulation-of-sodium-nitrite-sales-will-help-prevent-suicide/article_7df7adca-bbc0-11ee-954b-47c251423317.html). [HB 1150](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1150): False Slates of Electors This bill classifies the creation of a false slate of electors, serving as an elector in a false slate, and conspiring to create or serve in such a slate as perjury and forgery, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000. The bill was introduced in response to the 2020 election, during which a group of false electors not officially designated by political parties signed certificates falsely claiming that Donald Trump had won in their states. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Lorena Garcia, D-Denver, and Jennifer Parenti, D-Erie, and Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, D-Denver.

    "text": "Undeniably, we are witnessing a turning point in military aviation history. The F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter , an innovation of the United States, has now officially earned its distinction as the first fifth-generation aircraft certified to carry the B61-12 nuclear bomb. This success represents a significant evolution in advanced military technology, and undeniably, fortifies the F-35’s position at the forefront of the battlefield.\nPhoto credit: USAF Live ‘yellow-ringed’ warhead spotted on ‘canceled’ US missile F-35 nuke-strike certification rattles Russia, China, North Korea US allegedly pilfered sensitive KF-21 data to bolster F-35 sales According to BulgarianMilitary.com, a reliable source, the notable event of the F-35A receiving clearance to carry nuclear weapons occurred on October 12, 2023. This achievement, which was notably ahead of the initial deadline, was pledged to our NATO allies for January 2024.\nThis significant milestone paves the way for the F-35A to operate in a nuclear warfare scenario, turning it into an extraordinarily versatile and “dual capacity” platform.\nThe J-20 and Su-57 are lagging behind Unlike its counterpart, the F-22 Raptor, which is specifically designed for air-to-air combat, the F-35A was conceived with a tactical nuclear strike in mind. Due to its top-of-the-line stealth abilities, this fighter jet can successfully evade enemy radar detection, ensuring safe navigation through enemy airspace and accurate strike execution.\nWhile it’s true that both China’s J-20 and Russia’s Su-57 stealth fighters possess stealth combat capabilities, neither has yet managed to gain certification for carrying nuclear bombs. This particular distinction elevates the F-35A well above them, asserting it as a paramount force in the context of contemporary warfare.\nPhoto credit: Pinterest A deadly combination Essentially, we’re looking at a modernized version of the renowned B61 nuclear bomb, aptly named the B61-12. Key upgrades such as a maneuverable tail fin, missile spin stabilizer, and a cutting-edge guidance system elevate this bomb to the next level. When paired with the F-35A, it becomes a precision tool designed to lock onto targets with unprecedented accuracy.\nThe F-35’s signature traits: stealth, speed, and agility, make it a prime candidate for executing tactical nuclear strikes in contentious regions. What sets the F-35A apart from traditional bombers, which are prone to threats in enemy territory, is its ability to bypass defenses and carry out precision strikes with extraordinary proficiency.\nUndeniably, incorporating nuclear capabilities into a multipurpose platform like the F-35 changes the game in modern defense strategy. The F-35A is not just a tool for enhancing nuclear deterrence; it broadens the strategic alternatives defense planners can consider in this ever-changing, ever-challenging world that we call home.\nPhoto credit: Russian MoD The F-35 is making history Recognizing the F-35A’s capability to carry nuclear bombs firmly underscores the United States’ formidable technological prowess and forward-thinking innovation. This unmatched strength and capability serve not only as a safeguard for the defense of the US but also as a safety beacon for its allies in a world teeming with uncertainty.\nStepping into the annals of defense history, the F-35A boasts unique and state-of-the-art attributes that undoubtedly earmark it as a symbol of power and innovation. It propels us into the future, exemplifying what modern warfare will look like.\nThe ‘nuke’ F-35A Let’s delve into the F-35A, a unique variant in the fast-progressing F-35 Lightning II family of jets. This single-seater jet is designed to glide through all weather conditions, thanks to its robust stealth features. Measuring a striking 15.7 meters [51.4 feet] in length, with a wingspan of 10.7 meters [35 feet] and a height of 4.33 meters [14.2 feet], the impressive size of the jet demands attention. Weighing in at a formidable 70,000 pounds upon takeoff, the F-35A undoubtedly ranks as a vital contender within the fighter jet sphere.\nAt the heart of this fighter jet lies the Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 turbofan engine. This extraordinary engine generates an astonishing 40,000 pounds of thrust power, propelling the jet to top speeds exceeding 1,200 mph. To you jet enthusiasts, that converts to a speed of Mach 1.6! What sets the F-35A apart from its counterparts is the infusion of advanced technology into its system: leading-edge avionics, state-of-the-art sensors such as the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, and the exceptional Electro-Optical Targeting System [EOTS] that provides an additional edge in combat scenarios. For protection, it is equipped with the AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system to shield against electronic threats.\nPhoto credit: Reddit The F-35A exhibits commendable endurance as well. Powered solely by internal fuel, it can traverse an impressive distance of 1,200 nautical miles, indicating a sturdy combat range. As for firepower, the F-35A can accommodate two air-to-air missiles and two bombs in its internal weapons bay, thereby preserving its vital stealth feature. However, if stealth isn’t a priority, the F-35A flexibly offers external hardpoints capable of carrying additional weapons or fuel tanks.\n***\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.

I had to manually add the ninja module with '\n~/ncs/toolchains/7795df4459/usr/bin/python -m pip install ninja' (as well as the dependency for west). I'm suspecting that something has gone wrong during the toolchain installation but I was sure to follow the exact steps for the 'Command line' setup.\nI also don't see ninja listed as a python dependency\nhere.\nI'm on Linux (OpenSUSE).\nI setup the\nncs-example-application, just to verify that my toolchain is working and that I'm able to build any app.\nIt seems to me that the README.md here is outdated since it suggests to build the application with '\nwest build -b $BOARD app' but app does not exist after initializing with the initialization steps.

    "text": "Obiettivo dei Corsi è imparare a individuare episodi avvenuti sia tra le mura domestiche che sui luoghi di lavoro, garantendo così assistenza alle vittime\nNel 2025 il catalogo formativo di Ebit Lazio, l’Ente bilaterale del Commercio istituito e gestito dai sindacati di categoria Filcams Cgil, Fisascat Cisl, Uiltucs e da Confcommercio, si arricchirà di un nuovo percorso di formazione interamente dedicato al contrasto alle violenze di genere. L’iniziativa è stata presentata questa mattina a Roma, presso la Sala del Carroccio in Campidoglio, alla presenza di Guido Lazzarelli e Vittorio Pezzotti, presidente e vicepresidente Ebit Lazio, Simona Petrozzi, presidente Terziario Donna Confcommercio Roma, Romolo Guasco, direttore Confcommercio Roma, Alessandra Pelliccia, segretaria generale Filcams Cgil Roma e Lazio, Giulia Falcucci componente Segreteria Fisascat Cisl Roma e Lazio in sostituzione di Stefano Diociaiuti, Alessandro Maria Contucci e Roberta Valenti, rispettivamente segretario generale e componente di segreteria Uiltucs di Roma e Lazio, come parti socie di Ebit Lazio, e Svetlana Celli, presidente\ndell’Assemblea Capitolina. Il progetto è nato grazie all’impegno di Terziario Donna Confcommercio Roma.\n“Il Corso – ha spiegato Guido Lazzarelli – ha come obiettivo imparare a individuare episodi avvenuti sia tra le mura domestiche che sui luoghi di lavoro e garantire così assistenza alle vittime. Si rivolge ad una vasta platea, incluse le figure apicali delle aziende del terziario”. “Ogni anno – ha proseguito Lazzarelli – il nostro Ente, grazie alla collaborazione con enti formatori accreditati alla Regione Lazio, offre numerosi corsi di formazione sui temi più disparati: dall’informatica alla sicurezza, dalle lingue al management. Dal 2025 si potenzierà con questo nuovo percorso sul contrasto alla violenza di genere che ci inorgoglisce particolarmente perché affronta un tema purtroppo attuale: i luoghi di lavoro rappresentano sia un ambiente a rischio-violenza che un contesto nel quale è possibile individuare campanelli d’allarme delle vittime di violenze subite in ambito domestico”, ha concluso il presidente dell’Ente. “Non dobbiamo abbassare la guardia, ma\ndiventare sentinelle che vigilano su quanto ci accade intorno sia sul posto di lavoro che nell’ambito domestico – ha dichiarato Simona Petrozzi – anche perché è bene ricordare che non vi è parità finché ci sarà violenza di genere”.\n“Contrastare la violenza di genere è una responsabilità collettiva che coinvolge tutti, dalle istituzioni alle aziende, fino ai singoli cittadini”, ha affermato la presidente dell’Assemblea capitolina Svetlana Celli. “Il progetto di formazione presentato da EBiT Lazio – ha aggiunto – è un passo fondamentale in questa direzione, poiché mira a sensibilizzare e formare non solo le vittime, ma anche coloro che possono prevenire e intervenire. L’impegno di EBiT Lazio nel coinvolgere il settore terziario e commerciale del Lazio è un segno importante di come anche il mondo del lavoro possa fare la sua parte. Questa iniziativa, che si concentra sulla formazione e sulla consapevolezza, rappresenta un modello replicabile per affrontare questo tema in modo concreto e strutturato, sensibilizzando su larga scala”, ha concluso la presidente dell’Assemblea capitolina.\nIn chiusura le rappresentanti delle 3 organizzazioni sindacali, Roberta Valenti, Giulia Falcucci e Alessandra Pelliccia, hanno messo in evidenza la necessità di fare rete e mettere in campo tutte le esperienze già attive al fine di potenziare e valorizzare l’efficacia di queste buone pratiche, chiedendo a Ebit Lazio di prendere in carico questo progetto di percorsi formativi ad hoc, ritenendo la formazione lo strumento cardine per combattere questa piaga sociale e culturale.\nEbit Lazio si è fatto carico delle richieste e partirà dunque nel 2025 con questo ambizioso progetto. I docenti dei Corsi saranno individuati tra psicologi, medici, rappresentanti sindacali e avvocati. Il contrasto alla violenza di genere è un obiettivo che si pone anche il contratto collettivo nazionale di lavoro del terziario sottoscritto nel marzo del 2024, che all’articolo 16-bis prevede anche il congedo retribuito di 90 giorni per le lavoratrici inserite nei percorsi di protezione relativi alla violenza di genere.",

    "text": "До 2024 года уровень моря рос в основном благодаря таянию ледников. На этот процесс приходилось до двух третей ежегодного подъёма. Но уже в 2024 году главным источником такого повышения стало тепловое расширение морской воды. Всё в согласии с законами физики: теплая вода менее плотная, она занимает больший объём, чем холодная.\nНа фоне глобального потепления в последние три десятка лет океаны планеты прогревались рекордно. Ситуация усугублялась тем, что нагрев воды увеличивает число штормов. А при сильных ветрах слои воды перемешиваются, отчего и глубокие слои воды становятся теплее. И уровень Мирового океана растёт ещё больше.\nВ отдельных районах океана температура в два-три раза выше среднемировой. Отчего гибнут многие водные виды, создаётся проблема рыболовству.\nЕсть ещё одно опасное последствие. Рост уровня Мирового океана провоцирует затопление крупных рек морской водой. Вкупе со снижением объёма сезонных ледниковых талых вод заметно сокращаются запасы пресной воды в мире.",
