    "text": "( MENAFN - The Peninsula) AFP\nCenturion: India lost three wickets after conceding a first innings lead of 163 runs on the third day of the first Test against South Africa at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday.\nIndia were 62 for three at tea, still 101 runs in arrears, with Indian captain Rohit Sharma (0), fellow opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (5) and Shubman Gill (26) all back in the pavilion.\nDean Elgar (185) and Marco Jansen (84 not out) had transformed a slender 11-run lead for South Africa into a strong position, sharing a 111-run sixth wicket partnership.\nSouth African captain Temba Bavuma did not bat after suffering a hamstring injury on the first day.\nKagiso Rabada, who took five wickets in the first innings, had Jaiswal dropped by Aiden Markram at second slip off the first ball of the second innings.\nBut Rabada bowled Sharma in the next over with a superb delivery which deviated off a full length to hit off stump.\nBurger then produced a sharp lifter which Jaiswal gloved to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne.\nGill hit six boundaries in a 39-run stand with Virat Kohli (18 not out) before he was bowled when he played across a full ball from Jansen.\nShreyas Iyer was dropped in the last over before tea with his score on four when Keegan Petersen could not hold a sharp chance at third slip off Jansen.\nEarlier, Elgar and Jansen twice saw off the threat of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj -- at the start of play and later with the second new ball -- as they batted South Africa into a strong position.\nOpener Elgar took his overnight score of 140 to 185 before he gloved a catch down the leg side off Shardul Thakur.\nThe tall Jansen made his second Test half-century and highest score in accumulating 84 not out. He faced 147 balls and hit 11 fours and a six.\nBumrah was the pick of the Indian bowlers with 4-69.\nMENAFN28122023000063011010ID1107665559\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Alabama is taking no chances in the aftermath of Michigan's sign-stealing scandal .\nCrimson Tide players are barred from watching game film individually on their tablets as they normally do ahead of Monday's national semifinal game against the Wolverines. Instead, they're meeting at team facilities to watch film in groups.\nMultiple Alabama players addressed the new protocol in media sessions Thursday, including wide receiver Isaiah Bond and All-SEC left guard Tyler Booker. Head coach Nick Saban has not addressed the subject.\nBond appeared to break the news while answering questions from reporters in a news conference. Per Bond, players are prohibited from watching game film on tablets by themselves.\n\"We’ve been watching it together,\" Bond said of film study. \"I think they said Michigan was stealing signs for the first eight weeks or something like that. Us just watching film with the team because we’re not allowed to watch film on our own. We don’t want any stuff like that to happen again.\"\nHe confirmed that the protocol came down from the coaching staff.\n\"Our coaches told us that like a week ago,\" Bond said. … \"We’re not allowed to.\"\nThe Big Ten suspended Michigan head coach John Harbaugh for the final three games of the regular season for what it described as \"uncontroverted\" evidence of a scheme to steal signs from opposing teams. Michigan has parted with a recruiting staffer and an assistant coach with reported ties to the scandal in its aftermath.\nHarbaugh returned to the sideline for Michigan's 26-0 win over Iowa in the Big Ten championship and will lead the Wolverines against the Crimson Tide on Monday. Though the scandal appears to be in the past, Saban's taking no chances with a trip to the national championship at stake.\nBooker was hesitant to discuss the new protocol with reporters, but confirmed when pressed that players aren't permitted to watch game film individually. He doesn't expect the new protocol to impact Alabama's game preparation.\n\"We are still treating this game, this preparation like we would any other game,\" Booker said . … \"We just have to make sure we're watching film whether it be on our phone or in person in the room. Just have to make sure we watch the film any way we have to get it done.\"\nBond said that players were still getting in their normal amount of film prep.\n\"It doesn’t change at all,\" Bond said of Alabama's game prep. \"We’re still gonna watch the film. We’re still gonna get the hours in. We’re still gonna look over the defense, do everything we would in a regular game.\"\nHe also isn't bothered that the alleged sign stealing took place to begin. Football is still played on the field.\n\"It doesn’t even matter to me. At the end of the day, they’ve still gotta go on the field and play us. You can know my route, but you’ve still gotta guard me at the end of the day.\"",

    "text": "NASA Astronauts Will Wear Prada for Artemis Moonwalk Axiom Space unveils the spacesuit, designed in partnership with the luxury brand, that Artemis III astronauts will wear on the moon’s surface. NASA private contractor Axiom Space on Wednesday unveiled the flight design of its extravehicular mobility unit (AxEMU) spacesuit: the one astronauts will wear as they explore the lunar south pole during the Artemis III moon mission, [tentatively scheduled](https://www.flyingmag.com/nasa-delays-first-crewed-us-moon-landing-in-half-a-century-to-2026/) for September 2026. Axiom received a nearly $230 million task order to develop the AxEMU suit, which Artemis astronauts will test out on the lunar surface. The task order is part of a [contract with NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-partners-with-industry-for-new-spacewalking-moonwalking-services/) worth up to $3.5 billion that also includes Collins Aerospace, which earlier this year [abandoned efforts](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/science/nasa-spacesuits-iss-collins-contract-scn/index.html) to develop extravehicular activity (EVA) spacesuits under its own $100 million task order. NASA’s current EVA suits are more than four decades old, and recent malfunctions have forced the space agency to postpone [several](https://www.space.com/nasa-astronauts-spacewalk-june-13-2024-postponed) [spacewalks](https://www.space.com/international-space-station-spacewalk-coolant-leak-postpone). “We have broken the mold,” said Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space. “The Axiom Space-Prada partnership has set a new foundational model for cross-industry collaboration, further expanding what’s possible in commercial space.” Artemis III will land a crew at the lunar south pole, so Axiom’s suit is designed to withstand extreme temperatures in regions devoid of sunlight. Its portable life support system will keep astronauts safe on spacewalks for up to eight hours, the company says. Axiom says its design is more flexible, efficient, and safe than NASA’s existing suits. The AxEMU boots, for example, are built to withstand rough terrain and the freezing cold, while the helmet and visor covering are designed to improve astronauts’ vision of their surroundings. The suit can accommodate crew of nearly all body types. Several AxEMU systems are redundant, including an onboard diagnostic system that tracks the wearer’s vital signs. Astronauts can control its temperature using a carbon dioxide scrubber and cooling system. A 4G/LTE communications system allows them to keep in touch with the rest of the crew during excursions. The outer suit material, which was designed in partnership with Prada, will reflect heat and protect against small projectiles like dust. “I’m very proud of the result we’re showing today, which is just the first step in a long-term collaboration with Axiom Space,” said Lorenzo Bertelli, chief marketing officer and head of corporate social responsibility for Prada Group. “We’ve shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot.” According to Axiom, the suit will be designed for missions on the moon as well as in low-Earth orbit. That could be enticing for non-NASA customers that have different missions in mind. The firm on Wednesday said the AxEMU suit is close to the final stage of development, with a critical design review expected next year. Already, it has endured underwater, reduced gravity, and pressurized simulation testing at NASA facilities. In the coming months, the space agency will perform crewed underwater testing at its Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and gauge the suit’s fit with the prototype [lunar rover](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-companies-to-advance-moon-mobility-for-artemis-missions/) the Artemis astronauts will drive. Simultaneously, Axiom is developing the Axiom Station: one of [several commercial space outposts](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/leo-economy/nasas-commercial-partners-continue-progress-on-new-space-stations/) that could replace the International Space Station (ISS) when NASA [destroys it](https://www.flyingmag.com/modern/nasa-spacex-share-details-on-plan-to-destroy-iss/) at the end of the decade. The firm has already completed three NASA-approved [private astronaut missions](https://www.flyingmag.com/ax-3-commercial-astronauts-splash-down-after-18-days-aboard-iss/) to the ISS and is scheduled for a fourth in Spring 2025. NASA’s largest commercial partner, SpaceX, meanwhile, has developed [its own EVA spacesuit](https://www.flyingmag.com/what-is-polaris-dawn-breaking-down-the-upcoming-spacex-mission/), which debuted during the first civilian spacewalk on September’s Polaris Dawn mission. The company claims it will one day manufacture thousands of suits for future astronauts to build and explore on Mars. Like this story?

    "text": "If you're in Fort Pierce and you or someone you know needs a place to stay during the cold snap, an emergency warming shelter is open this weekend. With temperatures on the Treasure Coast expected to be in the mid-40s, Percy Peek Gym is making sure those in need have a warm place to stay and also a hot meal. Warren Stapleton was the first to use one of the 100 spots available at the shelter through the weekend. \"When you heard about the weather this weekend what went through your mind?\" asked WPTV reporter Joel Lopez. \"I'm gonna freeze to death sleeping out in a wheelchair with shorts and a T-shirt on,\" Stapleton said. He said a work-related accident left him homeless. \"I'm trying to get back on my feet and get things moving again, but it's really difficult when you're on your own, handicapped and disabled and trying to get some help,\" Stapleton said. As the sun went down in Fort Pierce on Friday, Dominque Cain-Douglas with the \"In the Image of Christ\" nonprofit helped to transform the gym into a cold weather shelter. \"We're here for the community for us to be open providing shelter, hot showers, breakfast, lunch and dinner,\" Cain-Douglas said. They said this is a resource they've provided for more than 10 years. However, they need donations for items like hygiene products, towels and clothes so people like Stapleton can stay warm. \"So they put me out this nice Columbia long-sleeve shirt, and it's perfect for me,\" Stapleton said. They said walk-ins are welcome and the Treasure Coast Homeless Council will be stopping by to offer long-term services to help people get back on their feet. \"This is not just a shelter,\" Cain-Douglas said. \"We actually try our best to make people feel welcome, to make them feel at home and as we are a family.\" Click here for more on the shelter's hours and transportation information. Below is a full list of shelters available along the Treasure Coast this weekend:",

    "text": "Preparing for change in a well-established, well-capitalized industry is not easy.\nSuch is the story for ticker symbol BYND, formally known as Beyond Meat (BYND) in supermarket aisles across the US.\nWhile Beyond Meat's stock price has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown has not. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry executive is focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n“We believe the cycle of history is in our favor and we're going to turn it into long-term success,” Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above). ,\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business.\nBeyond Meat burst onto investors' radar with a spectacular initial public offering on Nasdaq on May 5, 2019.\nInvestors gobbled up shares of a company they viewed as a leader in the emerging plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 per share, opened for trading at $46 and then rose to $65.75 by the close. Profit at the closing bell: a delicious 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite on May 2, 2019 in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\nFrom there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, including big deals with global restaurant chains like Yum! The brand is planning expansion into the refrigerated food sections of retailers such as KFC and Dunkin' Donuts (YUM), Target (TGT) and overseas, and efforts are underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items. Are.\nBy July 2019, Beyond Meat shares reached a peak of $234.90 per share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry, and its financial impact sent people turning back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat's impressive momentum has stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including rival Impossible Foods.\nAdditionally, attacks from strong parties in the meat industry and media on the healthfulness of plant-based items have damaged Beyond Meat's standing with consumers. By November 2022, as losses hit cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its employees.\nThen in November this year, Beyond Meat – which has cut prices to stimulate demand – said it would cut 19% of its non-production workforce after a lower-than-expected third quarter.\nThird-quarter sales fell 8.7% from a year earlier to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million based on adjusted operating profit.\n“You know there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and especially after the IPO,” Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round. “It was going to happen overnight.” Retrenchment. “This has clearly not been proven to be the case.”\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: surround yourself with great people, take a long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course.\n“But the reason we started this company and the reason consumers are reaching out to a product is getting stronger day by day, whether it's the health aspect, whether it's climate, whether it's energy and Whether it's water use or animal welfare,” Brown added. , “All of those issues are becoming serious, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.”\nToday, Beyond Meat's stock is trading at $8.95 per share – well below its staggering post-IPO high. According to comparative data from Yahoo Finance, the company has a market cap of $577.6 million, while Meat King Tyson (TSN) has a market cap of $18.46 billion.\n“In terms of the reasons for the softening in the US, it's pretty much the same: consumers continue to shy away from the category for a number of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or lack thereof),” said JPMorgan packaged foods analyst Kane. Are included.” Goldman said.\nGoldman has given Beyond Meat shares an underweight rating, which is equivalent to a sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) inside their new El Segundo, California headquarters about the path forward for the plant-based meat company. (Yahoo Finance)\nBrown, meanwhile, is focused on dismissing the critics. Beyond Meat recently opened a massive 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, California, just steps away from the headquarters of Barbie maker Mattel (MAT). The space is equipped with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a typically open floor plan that could herald the next big thing in plant-based dining.\nThe new facility also features a McDonald's (MCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 tall Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often walks around the building to interact with staff with his trademark calm, welcoming atmosphere.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won't be easy and he's not in the mindset to consider the business path forward yet at this point. But he will not shy away from his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and passion.\n“I want to see [my mission] Until completion,” Brown said. ''I think it would be something [that] When it's all said and done, I'll look back. But I'm in a fight right now, so it's hard to watch.”\nbrian sozzi is the executive editor of Yahoo Finance.

    "text": "The EU-Mercosul/Mercosur trade negotiations showcase significant geopolitical and economic dynamics.\nSpain’s Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and Germany’s Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, support the deal, contrasting with French President Emmanuel Macron’s opposition.\nMacron’s stance reflects domestic concerns over importing cheaper food, impacting France’s agricultural sector.\nSpain and Germany see the deal as vital for economic and geopolitical reasons, highlighting the diverse interests within the EU.\nDespite\nFrance‘s resistance, the European Commission continues negotiating with Mercosul, signaling a commitment to global trade partnerships.\nThis deal symbolizes a strategic move by the\nEU to strengthen ties in South America, countering China’s growing influence in the region.\nThe EU’s interest in Mercosul is partly a response to China’s investments there, as Europe seeks to assert its presence in a multipolar world.\nGlobally, these negotiations occur amid rising trade tensions and a shift toward protectionism.\nA successful agreement would mark a stance for multilateralism and open markets, opposing the trend of economic nationalism.\nRegionally, it could redefine South America’s trade relationships, historically centered around North American and Asian markets.\nIn addition, this realignment could reshape regional economies and global trade strategies.\nInternationally, the EU-Mercosul deal could become a benchmark for future agreements, especially in integrating environmental and agricultural standards.\nIts outcome might influence other regions negotiating similar deals, shaping global trade policy.\nThe negotiations go beyond immediate economic benefits, embodying strategic, geopolitical, and policy considerations.\nThey represent the complex interplay of commerce, politics, and diplomacy in today’s world.\nIn short, the EU-Mercosul talks thus hold significant implications for global, regional, and national levels, indicating the nuanced nature of modern trade agreements.",

    "title": "Five Things to Know About Oregon State's Newest Commit: WR Cynai Thomas",
    "text": "PROMO: Join BeaversEdge.com and get 30 DAYS FREE!\nOn Sunday, Oregon State landed their fourth commitment of the 2026 recruiting cycle when three-star wide receiver Cynai Thomas made his decision. Below, BeaversEdge provides five things you should know about Thomas and his recruitment.\n1. Oregon State beat out quality competition to land Cynai Thomas\nThis is a significant early-cycle recruiting win for Oregon State and an impressive first-year victory for new wide receivers coach Pat McCann. Thomas had an extensive offer list, including Arizona, Arizona State, Auburn, Boise State, Cal, Duke, Iowa State, Minnesota, Ole Miss, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Washington State, among others.\nThomas previously spoke with BeaversEdge about McCann's role in his recruitment, emphasizing their strong connection.\n\"I feel like I’ve known him forever,\" Thomas said. \"We talked a bunch of times. He’s a great guy, and he knows what it takes to get to the next level.\"\nMcCann deserves credit for closing the deal on Thomas after Kefense Hynson’s departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n2. Cynai is the younger brother of current Beaver Skyler Thomas\nFamily ties played a significant role in Cynai Thomas' commitment to Oregon State, as he follows in the footsteps of his older brother, Skyler.\nSkyler, now entering his redshirt senior season, has been a key piece of the Beavers' secondary, totaling 113 tackles, one tackle for loss, and two interceptions. However, Cynai told BeaversEdge that how Oregon State supported Skyler during his injury-shortened 2023 season was a major factor in his decision.\n“It’s played a big role,” Cynai said when asked about his brother’s influence. “I saw how Oregon State treated my brother after he got injured,” he added, noting the program's positive approach.\nDespite the family connection, the Thomas brothers won’t get the chance to play together, as Skyler is set to wrap up his college career before Cynai arrives in Corvallis next year.\nManage privacy settings\n3. Thomas had a strong junior season for Archbishop Riordan\nThe California wide receiver has posted impressive numbers in consecutive seasons for Archbishop Riordan. As a sophomore, Thomas recorded 41 receptions for 679 yards and seven touchdowns. He built on that success as a junior, hauling in 47 receptions for 727 yards and 12 touchdowns.\n4. Northern and Central California continues to be a stronghold for Oregon State\nOregon State continues to excel in recruiting Northern and Central California, making it a focal point of their efforts year after year. So far this cycle, the Beavers have landed two prospects from the region in quarterback Deagan Rose and now Cynai Thomas.\nIn the 2025 recruiting cycle, they dipped into Northern and Central California for five commitments including quarterback Tristan Ti'a, wide receiver Elijah Washington, running back Kourdey Glass, and defensive end Logan Knapp. In the 2024 cycle, signees Aiden Sullivan and Amarion York both hailed from either Nothern or Central California. as well.\n5. This is the earliest Oregon State has had four commitments in the Rivals era\nBelieve it or not, this is the fastest Oregon State has picked up four commitments in a recruiting cycle during the Rivals recruiting era (1998–present). Despite a disappointing season, the Beavers have built momentum on the recruiting trail, a testament to Trent Bray and his staff.\nA full look at Oregon State's 2026 recruiting class\n• TALK ABOUT IT ON THE DAM BOARD\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR PODCASTS ON APPLE & SPOTIFY\n• LIKE US & FOLLOW OUR FACEBOOK\n• FOLLOW THE STAFF ON TWITTER - @Beavers_Edge, @b_slaught, @RivalsDylanCC, & @ryan_harlan",

    "text": "TYLER, Texas — An East Texas organization is stepping up to transport hospital staff and first responders to work during the arctic weather in Tyler. [East Texas Jeep Club](https://www.facebook.com/EastTexasJeepClub) leader David Featherston said the crew is preparing to transport CHRISTUS Mother Frances Hospital employees to and from work as temperatures begin to drop. \"If the bad weather event happens, we will start reaching out to people to get people traveled back and forth properly,\" Featherston said. The East Texas Jeep Club started as an opportunity for like-minded folks to have some fun on the weekends. But during the freeze of 2021, they stepped up to help the community. \"We already had a group of people who were out playing, having fun in the snow. I know of at least six that I had that were running the roads and pulling people out of ditches, and just helping the general public. And I started getting contacts from all kinds of people needing rides, and that’s how it just happened,\" Featherston said. Featherston said the organization is prepared to help the hospital staff this weekend. \"You know, if you’re going to get in touch with us needing a ride, then we just mainly need to know where you’re at, which hospital, which location you need to go to, and what time you need to arrive,\" Featherston said. \"And then we will work at getting someone scheduled to pick you up and get you to your location on time.\"",
