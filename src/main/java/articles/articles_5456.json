    "title": "Boeing Workers Begin Massive Strike, Production of 737 Max Halted",
    "text": "Boeing workers in Washington state and Oregon went on strike Friday, bringing construction of Boeing’s 737 Max planes to a halt. Boeing’s stock prices -- already battered by a chain of events that began when the door to a Boeing jet blew off in midair -- dropped 2.3 percent on Friday, according to Reuters. The strike is the company's first since 2008. Pay was a top issue in the talks. Boeing offered workers a 25 percent pay hike over four years; workers wanted 40 percent. BREAKING: @Boeing machinists vote to STRIKE, effective immediately. This means 32,000 @IAM751 and W24 members are on the picket lines starting TONIGHT. Vote to strike was 96% for it pic.twitter.com\\/gBUKmkRYOn — Ryan Simms (@RyanTVnews) September 13, 2024 About 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are now staffing picket lines after 96 percent of those voting on the contract voted for the strike. \"This is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, lead negotiator for the union. Holden said the union was ready to go back to the table. Boeing offered a similar sentiment. \"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union,\" the company said. New Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg had urged workers to accept the contract on the grounds that a strike could further damage the company, according to CNBC. Reuters reported that if workers strike for very long, the company would add to its roughly $60 billion in debt. According to The New York Times, citing an estimate from Cai von Rumohr, a research analyst at TD Cowen, if this strike lasts as long as 2008’s 50-day walkout, it would cost Boeing at least $3 billion. Even before the strike, production of the 737 Max was behind schedule at the Renton, Washington, factory where they are made. The slowdown is linked to quality improvements the company has needed to make after the January incident where a 737 Max lost a panel in midair. Fitch warns extended Boeing $BA strike could lead to credit rating downgrade, posing operational and financial risks to the planemaker. — AS Research (@alertscreener) September 13, 2024 On Friday, Boeing CFO Brian West said the strike will “jeopardize” Boeing's recovery if it lasts very long, according to CNBC. West did not discuss whether the strike could impact plans to produce 38 planes per month by the end of the year.",

    "text": "The last hours in Spain have left a desolate panorama. Since this past Tuesday, a DANA (isolated depression at high levels) has left multiple material damage on the Peninsula and has claimed almost 150 lives during the floods it has caused. Locations of Valencian Community, Andalusia, Catalonia and Castilla-La Mancha have experienced the worst side of this storm, which continues to affect our country now, as the State Meteorological Agency has warned ( Aemet ).\nAfter this emergency situation, the focus is now on the evolution of this DANA and how long the devastating consequences it has caused during its time in our country will last. Now, coinciding with the All Saints Bridge which begins this November 1, the storm is heading towards Portugal, although the rains will not disappear of our country and there is still danger.\nUpdate | Special warning for intense rains in the Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.\nThis Tuesday is the most adverse day of the episode, but the very heavy showers will continue during the following days.\nMore details\nhttps://t.co/8PQPlLSl74 pic.twitter.com/BTdRF45lzh\n— AEMET (@AEMET_Esp) October 29, 2024\nAccording to Aemet, during the next few hours we will continue to be immersed in a episode of heavy rain which will leave rainfall in many parts of the east of the country. But until when will this DANA definitely last according to Aemet? This is what will happen over the weather during the November long weekend.\nHow long will DANA last in Spain?\nAccording to eltiempo.es, this Friday, November 1, coinciding with the All Saints’ holiday in Spain DANA will be located to the west of the peninsula, over Portugal. Throughout this day, the easterly winds will continue, which will “providing humidity in the Mediterranean” maintaining rainfall in the same areas affected by the storm in the last few hours.\nWe will have heavy rains throughout the holiday in the northeast and southwest of the peninsula, which could even reach Balearic Islands throughout the day, dumping quite intense showers there. As Aemet has confirmed, in many areas of Spain “the adverse situation will continue during the weekend”: “ The meteorological emergency has not ended . “DANA continues over Spain,” they have warned from the meteorological service, which will maintain the orange level warnings in these regions this Friday due to accumulations that could exceed the 50mm in 1 hour .\nDANA will lose intensity during the first hours of the weekend and will weaken as it moves south. Despite this, the rains will continue to persist in many parts of the country and Aemet calls for caution in the face of its possible consequences. «On Thursday and Friday there will be storms again in the southern Catalonia locally intense and rainy again abundant in Extremadura and Western Andalusia », explained Rubén del Campo.\nDespite this, the organization points out that these Precipitation will have “nothing to do with with what we have seen in the Mediterranean area. Records are expected that, in some cases, could exceed the 15 or 20 liters per square meter in one hour: « The rains are abundant, but not torrential. », they have warned from Aemet, which expects locally intense rains during the weekend in parts of the Mediterranean and southern Andalusia.\nTemperatures for the All Saints Bridge\nDuring this November long weekend, there will still be some « remains of instability in areas of the Mediterranean between the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and the north of the Valencian Community,” explained meteorologist Mario Picazo. « Don’t have a sense of false security in areas of the coast where it does not rain,” Aemet has warned, explaining that the orography can amplify the rainfall in these next few hours.\nAlthough the organization has asked to maintain “caution” and be attentive to changes in the weather forecast, everything indicates that stability will gain ground to the rains as the All Saints’ Bridge weekend progresses.\nThroughout the weekend, we will also have generally mild temperatures for the season. During these days, the values it will be around 20 degrees in many capitals, while in the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands they could approach the 25 degrees maximum . For its part, on the northern plateau and the west of the peninsula some slightly cooler thermometers could be recorded, although everything indicates that the minimum temperatures will remain. above 10 degrees .\n#Aemet #warns #weather #Spain #Saints #long #weekend #date #DANA",

    "text": "NEW PARIS, Ind. (WSBT) — An attempted break in at a New Paris Church on Christmas eve was unsuccessful.\nThe Church of the Nazarene had two different failed break-in locations – one in a storage shed and another in the church.\nA church official says planning helped repel the thieves.\nAround 5 a.m. on Christmas Eve morning, a motion detecting alarm was triggered from a broken window in the church. Before it was broken, this Christmas Grinch had attempted to get in the church's shed.\n\"They started out with the shed, broke to it first, and they were unable to get anything out of it, because everything was cabled and chained up. And then evidently, they came over to the church window,” said Bob Rossi, Church of the Nazarene Head Trustee.\nThe shed had a thick cable connecting all equipment inside. So, if someone were to break past the locked door, they would not leave with the equipment inside.\nIn a Kevin McCallister-like-move from the Christmas classic Home Alone, a previous break in inspired defensive measures made to protect the property from any type of burglary.\n\"They did break the padlock and got in the building, but they were able to get away with her mower and stuff and after that that's when I decided well, I'm going to cable everything so if they do get in the building they would not be able to get anything out of it,” said Rossi.\nRossi says this defensive move worked like a charm.\n“Unless they had something to cut a pretty heavy cable,” said Rossi.\nSE: And that defense worked?\n“That worked they were not able to get the stuff out of the building,” said Rossi.\nRossi says he's grateful the church's Christmas morning services were able to go on as planned that next day and that nothing was taken.\n\"We are just grateful they never got them, and never got away with anything,” said Rossi.\nThe church will continue to stay open every Sunday even if the window is temporarily boarded up.\nIf you have any additional information on this failed break in, please contact the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office.",

In 2024, the event will again be held in an online format in Russia. The organizers have experience in holding events online. This format was used during the pandemic. There are several ways to honour veterans. For example, print out photos and stick them on your car or clothes. There is a design tool on the Immortal Regiment [website](https://www.polkrf.ru/shtender), where you can choose a frame for a photo, sign the person’s full name and dates of life. Global flash mobs are also planned on social networks. There you can not only post photos, but also share stories about the lives and feats of your relatives with the hashtag #нашБессмертныйПолк (#ourImmortalRegiment). Photos of heroes of the Great Patriotic War will be broadcast on the [Immortal Regiment](https://www.moypolk.ru/) website. In addition, portraits can be seen on media facades in Russian cities and on federal channels. And from May 1st, members of the Volunteers of Victory movement will launch a chatbot on Telegram to create memorable avatars for social networks. The main point of the regiment's march is to preserve personal, family memory of the generation of the Great Patriotic War. Anyone can join the campaign. To do this, you only need a photograph of the hero who brought the Great Victory closer.",

The Pittsburgh Pirates rookie and No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft hit 102 mph on the radar gun and got the best of a pair of fellow former No. 1 picks in his MLB spring training debut. He did so en route to a 1-2-3 inning as his only action of the day. [Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for the 2024 MLB season ] The main event led off the bottom of the first inning. There, Skenes faced off with Orioles leadoff hitter and 2022 No. 1 overall pick shortstop Jackson Holliday. Skenes induced a groundout with a 100 mph fastball. For his next opponent, Skenes faced 2019 No. 1 pick and Orioles All-Star catcher Adley Rutschman. Rutschman took a 101 mph ball, then barreled a 99 mph Skenes fastball to the warning track. But Edward Olivares was there waiting to record out No. 2. Paul Skenes hit 102 mph twice (on the scoreboard gun) in a scoreless first inning. Here's another battle of No. 1 overall picks, with Adley Rutschman taking 101 mph for a ball & then driving 99 mph to the warning track in RF.— Jim Callis (@jimcallisMLB) [pic.twitter.com/WEMV8SgQpb] [February 29, 2024] Skenes then induced Kjerstad a fly-out from right fielder Heston Kjerstad to end his debut and secure a 1-2-3 inning. Per MLB.com's Jim Callis, Skenes twice hit 102 mph on the scoreboard radar gun. He did all this while pitching to catcher Henry Davis, the No. 1 pick in the 2021 MLB draft. Skenes joined the Pirates in the draft from LSU, where he won multiple National Player of the Year and National Pitcher of the Year honors while leading the Tigers to the 2023 College World Series championship. Expectations are high for both Skenes and Holliday as they prepare for their respective MLB debuts, whenever they may come.",
