    "text": "2023-12-29 11:30:05\nA cell phone that turns off without warning, or a car breakdown? Yes, it can be caused by low temperatures. But why do batteries discharge faster in these conditions?\nThis will also interest you\n[EN VIDÉO] From Volta to graphene: the evolution of batteries The most common type of battery is the lithium-ion battery. Several technologies are on…\nThere are two main elements to know in a battery: the electrodeselectrodes and the electrolyte. The electrodes are theanodeanodeor negative pole, and the cathodecathodeor positive pole, between which circulate the electronselectrons. The passage of electrons from one pole to the other provides theenergyenergy necessary for the operation of a device, or for its recharging — we will see in a moment that their direction of circulation is important.\nNo time to read? Listen to the answer in our episode of Science or Fiction on the subject! © Futura\nBut, to circulate, electrons need a medium in which to evolve. Thus, between the cathode and the anode, there is a liquidliquid called “conductor” called electrolyte. THE ionsions which make up this electrolyte are in movementmovement, and it is this mobility which generates current by circulating electrons. This set of electrodes and electrolyte forms what is called a cell which allows energy to be generated.\nA battery is made up of thousands of cells working together. So, when we use our cell phone for example, the electrical circuit is in a so-called “closed” state. This means that the anode loses electrons and the cathode will recover them. In other words, it is the phenomenon that creates enough electricity for you to use your smartphone all day long. Conversely, when you recharge the battery, the chemical process that takes place is reversed: this time, the electrical circuit is open, and the electrons then go in the opposite direction.\nBatteries facing winter temperatures\nAll the chemical reactionschemical reactions which lead to the proper functioning of a battery are not necessarily adapted to climatesclimates extremes. Under low temperatures, a battery will produce much less current. And for good reason, chemical reactions take place more slowly. The electrolyte loses its ability to conductivityconductivity. It is more viscous, and its voltage increases, so the movement of electrons, from one electrode to another, is more complicated, and therefore greatly slowed down. In this context, the energy consumed will mainly generate enough heatheat to simply operate the battery which therefore discharges much more quickly. This is why it is better to store your phone in an inside pocket in very cold weather.winterwinter.\nIf this is not possible for you, know that there are also so-called “low temperature” batteries which will withstand these conditions. These batteries work thanks to a modification made to one of the electrodes. The anode in the batteries of an ordinary telephone is in graphitegraphiteand materialmaterial which tends to perform less well in winter. To deal with this problem, researchers have succeeded in developing a battery with a new anode in carbonecarbone called “non-graphitizable”. The principle remains the same, but this new material allows electron transfers under -40°C.\nThat said, this technology is valid for cell phones but, for cars, it is more complicated. For the moment, the solution found by certain countries experiencing episodes of extreme cold would be to connect the carscars on electricity inlets in car parks to keep the engine, oil and battery warm.\n1703868253\n#batteries #discharge #faster #cold",

    "title": "UK's Starmer receives warm reception at NATO in post-election honeymoon",
    "text": "Hugs, handshakes and back-slapping greeted Keir Starmer on his first international outing as Britain's new prime minister at NATO this week, a warm welcome from several Western leaders who envy his big majority in parliament.\nVery much a new boy among his more seasoned peers, Starmer often looked bowled over, sometimes bewildered, by his first summit, but he used it to show off a new image for Britain, a stable country in contrast to its somewhat chaotic recent past.\nThe timing of his landslide victory - earlier than expected after predecessor Rishi Sunak set a July date - means Starmer can use the NATO summit and next week's European Political Community meeting to build ties with world leaders.\nHe will stress his foreign policy goals: resetting relations with the European Union after years of Brexit rancour, reclaiming Britain's leading role in tackling climate change and building ties with the Global South.\n\"It's a fantastic opportunity to be here within the first week of having formed a Labour government ..., talking to our allies and being absolutely clear about our commitment to NATO,\" he told GB News.\n\"So it's a good early opportunity for me to set out my priorities, to ... engage with other international leaders.\"\nStill in a honeymoon period at home, Starmer can project a sense of stability not enjoyed by several leaders at NATO.\nWith US President Joe Biden facing calls to end his re-election campaign, French leader Emmanuel Macron's early election gamble ending in a hung parliament and Germany's Olaf Scholz under pressure from the far right, Starmer is in an enviable position at the start of his five-year term.\nDespite that he will not have unlimited room for manoeuvre. His pledge to keep a tight grip on public finances means he faced questions over when defence spending would reach 2.5% of GDP, and any attempt to improve trade ties with Europe could entail trade-offs over sovereignty, potentially galvanising his shattered political opposition who supported Brexit.\nThe possible election in the US of Donald Trump would also pose new diplomatic challenges for the centre-left leader.\nUkraine Commitment\nOn Ukraine, Starmer offered continuity.\nBritain has long been one of the leading supporters of Kyiv since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February, 2022, and he recommitted to the former Conservative government's military and financial aid pledges, albeit to speed them up.\nHis foreign minister, David Lammy, toured Germany, Poland and Sweden over the weekend to emphasise their shared support for Ukraine, and Defence Secretary John Healey headed quickly to Kyiv to tell President Volodymyr Zelenskiy the Labour government would have an \"ironclad\" commitment to supporting Ukraine.\nIn a meeting with Zelenskiy in Washington, where the two hugged warmly, Starmer told the Ukrainian leader: \"There's a change of government but no change of approach.\"\nIt was no surprise that his first bilateral meeting at NATO was with Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a man who the Labour Party turned to for election advice after the German leader changed his centre-left SDP's election fortunes in 2021.\nIt was a sign that Britain's Labour government wants to move fast in resetting relations with the EU after years of rows sparked by the 2016 referendum, promising to improve trading rules over what it describes as the \"botched deal\" secured by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nThe government is likely to use its strength in security and defence as one way to rebuild bridges with Europe. A nuclear power with strong intelligence capabilities and a member of the \"Five Eyes\" alliance, Britain also boasts strong defence companies in the likes of BAE.\n\"I've been clear with international leaders here that we do want to reset the relationship with individual countries, whether they're EU or not,\" Starmer told GB News.\nAfter NATO he will switch his focus to the July 18 meeting of the European Political Community, a group of more than 40 European states formed in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, where he hopes to press his plan to secure a security pact with the EU.\nIn Washington, he had a \"brush by\" with Macron, who pulled him into a meeting room for a congenial chat, but Starmer's team said he was focusing on leaders he would not see at the EPC.\nThe warm welcome is likely to have provided a brief distraction from difficult domestic issues, including over Gaza after he lost votes among some left-wing and Muslim voters, and with prisons which will pose an almost immediate threat as they become close to being completely full.\nFor one source travelling with the Ukrainian delegation, it was a relief to see Starmer follow in the steps of Sunak and Johnson who pledged staunch support. But they accepted that politics always raises its head eventually.\n\"Britain is like a giant airship, it would take a lot to turn its direction (on Ukraine),\" the source said on condition of anonymity.\n\"The UK is one of our biggest supporters but we shall see ... Give it a bit of time to see if they start fighting among themselves.\"\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our\n[Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",

    "title": "BREAKING: Chrysler C6X (CA) Electric SUV Development Suspended",
    "text": "Chrysler Airflow Concept Three years ago at CES 2022, Chrysler showed off a concept of a production-ready-looking mid-sized electric SUV called the Airflow. This vehicle was to be based on the variant of the upcoming STLA large platform underpinning the new Dodge Charger Daytona . A few months later in April, Chrysler showed off another version of the concept called the Airflow Graphite Concept .\n2022 Chrysler Airflow Concept BEV. (Chrysler). While not a super futuristic, outlandish design, the Airflow was a very handsome concept and looked to be production ready both interior, and exterior wise as soon as Stellantis had their STLA Large platform ready to go.\nBack To The Drawing Board A little over a year later, in an interview with MotorTrend , Ralph Gilles mentioned that they were going back to the drawing board on the Airflow concept.\n“She wanted a statement that had literally zero to do with anything that you have seen today, even the Airflow concept car. It is evolving in a new direction.”\n-Ralph Gilles in an interview to MotorTrend talking about Chrysler CEO Chris Fuell\nThe project for Chryslers Midsized electric SUV has been under development under the C6X (CA) codename. Where as C6X stands for the Variant of STLA large platform the vehicle was to be on, while CA would likely stand for Chrysler Airflow. This vehicle was scheduled to be built alongside the Chrysler Pacifica and Dodge Charger Daytona and Sixpack models at the Windsor Assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario Canada.\nProject Suspended Email Sent To Suppliers Regarding the Chrysler C6X program Well, unfortunately for fans of the Chrysler brand that have been waiting and hoping to see a production version of the Chrysler Airflow, things aren’t looking good. A source close to MoparInsiders just sent a screen shot of the email above which states:\nDear Supplier,\nThe C6X (CA) program has been put on hold until further notice. Therefore, any spending associated with this program should be suspended immediately.\n2022 Chrysler Airflow Concept BEV. (Chrysler). While suspended doesn’t mean cancelled, it is not good news for fans of the Chrysler brand who have been waiting for new product. We currently do not have any other information to share, but will keep on top of the story as it develops.",
