    "text": "The government is trying to frame a housing policy that is environment-friendly, focussed on inexpensive constructions and acceptable to all, Minister for Housing K. Rajan has said. He was replying to a question by Kadakampally Surendran, MLA, during the Question Hour in the Assembly on Thursday. The Minister said double houses built under the Lakshamveedu scheme would be converted into single houses through two projects - MN Suvarna Bhavanam and MN Navayuga scheme. In the ₹5-lakh Suvarna Bhavanam scheme, ₹2 lakh will be government subsidy, ₹1 lakh will be borne by the local body, and ₹2 lakh will be beneficiary contribution. MN Navayuga scheme will be for who are unable to afford this. In this scheme, the government contribution will be ₹75,000 and the rest will be found through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding. Construction of the National Housing Park at Vazhamuttom in the State capital will begin this year, the Minister said. The park that will showcase models of various technologies used for construction of houses suitable to the State will come up on 6.9 acres of land sanctioned by the government. There will be 40 such constructions at the park, the first such project in the country, the Minister said. It will bring under one umbrella research, short-term training, finishing school, seminars, and other aspects related to construction of houses.",

    "title": "Are the Actors in The Chosen Christian? Exploring Faith and Casting",
    "text": "‘The Chosen’ has captivated audiences worldwide with its unique storytelling approach to the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. As the first multi-season series dedicated to this narrative, it has sparked conversations not only about its artistic and narrative aspects but also regarding the faith of its cast. This blog delves into the series’ impact, its portrayal of biblical events, and the intriguing question: Are the actors in The Chosen Christian?\nThis exploration seeks to understand how personal faith intersects with professional portrayal in a series dedicated to depicting the cornerstone of Christianity.\nThe Series Overview\n‘The Chosen,’ created by Dallas Jenkins, aims to bring the story of Jesus Christ to life in a way that’s accessible and relatable to a modern audience. By focusing on the personal backgrounds and emotional journeys of biblical figures, the series offers a fresh perspective on familiar stories. Its crowdfunded nature underscores a grassroots support rarely seen in television productions, emphasizing the community’s desire for content that resonates with their faith and values.\nThe series has been praised for its historical authenticity, character development, and the respectful depiction of biblical events, making it a significant topic of discussion among both believers and non-believers.\nThe Cast’s Faith Background\nThe question of whether the actors in ‘The Chosen’ are Christian stems from a broader curiosity about how much personal beliefs influence an actor’s portrayal of religious figures. While not all cast members have publicly discussed their faith, several key actors have openly shared their Christian beliefs and how these beliefs have impacted their approach to their roles.\nJonathan Roumie, who plays Jesus, has been vocal about his Catholic faith, describing it as central to his life and his portrayal of Christ. His faith has allowed him to approach the role with a profound respect and a deep sense of responsibility.\nSimilarly, other cast members, such as Elizabeth Tabish (Mary Magdalene), have expressed how their personal faith or spiritual journeys have informed their performances, bringing authenticity and emotional depth to their roles.\nRELATED:\nNew ‘Faith-Adjacent’ Film Will Help Church Leaders Talk to Teens About Mental Health\nHowever, the series also includes actors who have not publicly identified as Christian or have kept their personal beliefs private. Dallas Jenkins has emphasized that the primary criterion for casting was not the actor’s faith but their ability to authentically portray the characters. This inclusive approach has allowed ‘The Chosen’ to benefit from a diverse range of talents, enriching the series with varied perspectives and interpretations.\nImpact on Viewers and Discussion\nThe diversity in the cast’s faith backgrounds has sparked discussions about the significance of an actor’s personal beliefs in portraying religious figures. Some viewers argue that a shared faith between the character and the actor can enhance the authenticity of the portrayal, while others believe that professional skill and empathy are sufficient for a compelling performance.\n‘The Chosen’ has successfully navigated these discussions by focusing on the humanity of biblical figures, making their stories accessible and relatable to a broad audience.",

We have more newsletters\nShow Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice During the peak holiday season, Europe can get extremely busy, and a travel expert has pointed out that one of Italy&apos;s prime attractions is now too crowded. To manage the influx of tourists, some destinations like Barcelona have raised their tourist taxes.\nHolidu&apos;s research indicates that Dubrovnik is currently the world&apos;s most overcrowded tourist spot, with a ratio of 30 visitors to every local. But which other locations are known to be swamped in summer?\nSara Rodriguez, a seasoned traveller and the blogger behind Madrid Traveling, spoke to Express.co.uk about four places she found overwhelmingly crowded, reports the Express .\nPositano, Italy In the stunning Amalfi Coast of southern Italy lies Positano, a village famed for its breathtaking views and steep, cliffside buildings. Despite its beauty, Sara described the location as overly \"hectic\".\nShe said: \"While undeniably beautiful with its colourful buildings and seaside views, the narrow streets were packed shoulder to shoulder with other sightseers.\"\nShe added: \"The atmosphere felt more hectic than idyllic and prices were inflated for tourists. I left feeling like I never got to experience the real Positano beyond the chaotic surface.\"\nParis, France Paris, France , also made her list of excessively busy spots. The &apos;City of Love&apos;, Paris, might be a top choice for many European travellers, but visitors like Sara are reporting less-than-stellar experiences in the French city.\nShe expressed her frustrations: \"The congested boulevards of Paris and the never-ending line-ups at attractions like the Eiffel Tower and Louvre strained my patience. I didn&apos;t really enjoy the atmosphere as much as I was waiting to take shots.\"\nThis viewpoint resonates with other tourists on TripAdvisor, including one visitor to the Louvre Museum who shared: \"The art is crazy but the queues are insane. Two hours to access the museum and then you can barely walk due to the quantity of tourists. They should regulate this.\"\nAdding to the city&apos;s struggles with overtourism, the Olympics and Paralympics also drew large crowds this year. This surge comes despite the decision by Paris City Hall to hike up the tourist tax by 200 percent for 2024, a move meant to support Ile-de-France Mobilites, the body overseeing public transport including the metro and bus services, expected to ferry an increased number of passengers during the global event.\nMykonos, Greece Meanwhile, Greece&apos;s Mykonos sees its bustling tourist season between Greek Easter (April) and the end of October, reaching a peak between mid-July to late August. Despite the premium cost associated with staying on this picturesque Greek island, it continues to draw travellers of all ages, though its prices significantly outpace those of nearby locations like Syros.\nTourists at Niko&apos;s Taverna on Mykono, Greece (Image: Getty) Sara expressed her disappointment with the bustling atmosphere of popular destinations. She said: \"When I finally went to the Greek island, I thought it would be a tranquil haven. Even while it was breathtakingly gorgeous, I felt that partygoers and inebriated vacationers overshadowed it. The restaurants were expensive and the beaches were noisy.\"\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands Amsterdam , known for its dynamic culture, storied history, and picturesque canals, has been grappling with the issue of over-tourism. The city&apos;s 17th-century canal ring is a standout feature, creating an urban landscape unlike any other.\nAmsterdam (Image: Getty) However, despite its charm, Amsterdam&apos;s popularity means it&apos;s often crowded, especially given its relatively small size compared to London. Last year alone, the city saw 15.1 million day visitors, with around 60 percent being domestic tourists, as reported by the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.\nSara&apos;s experience in Amsterdam was less than ideal due to the congestion. She said: \"The city centre was overrun with rowdy bachelor parties riding bikes through crowded streets. The museums were packed and reservations at restaurants were impossible to get.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

    "text": "Overhead Cables Market Expected to Surge Significantly by 2028 [Olivia Taylor](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79141)Updated: 10-17-2024 06:10 PM Overview of the Overhead Cables Market Growth The global overhead cables market is projected for substantial growth, estimated to increase by USD 17.8 billion in the upcoming years. This anticipated surge is largely supported by the rise in renewable power generation and the integration of advanced technologies into market practices. The market is forecasted to expand at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.15% during this transformation period. Factors Driving Market Growth There are several key factors contributing to the upward trajectory of the overhead cables market. A significant driver is the rising electricity demand, especially as countries invest heavily in renewable energy technologies. This is particularly apparent in regions where governments are committed to sustainable energy sources, thereby boosting the demand for overhead cables. Regional Growth Trends Economic expansion in various regions, particularly those within the Gulf Cooperation Council, has led to increased energy consumption. Several countries are pursuing substantial investments in new energy projects, including nuclear power plants and renewable sources. Such initiatives are crucial in offsetting the typical electricity shortages experienced in growing economies. Technological Advancements and AI Influence Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are also reshaping the market landscape. AI technologies are being utilized to optimize power management and distribution, improve efficiencies, and minimize energy loss. These innovations are expected to enhance operational efficiency, helping energy producers and distributors adapt to the demands of modern electrification. Market Challenges and Considerations While the outlook for the overhead cables market is promising, there are challenges that need addressing. Fluctuating raw material prices, particularly for aluminum and copper, significantly affect production costs. Such price volatility could hinder profitability for manufacturers if not managed properly. Contractual price adjustments and strategic sourcing of materials become essential for maintaining stable operations in this competitive environment. Impact of Urbanization and Infrastructure Development The rapid pace of urbanization is pushing for modernized infrastructure, consequently increasing the demand for overhead cables. As cities grow and expand, nations are compelled to upgrade their electricity grids and enhance transmission capacities. The migration towards smart cities and sustainable practices is also fostering an environment ripe for growth. Future Market Outlook Looking ahead, the overhead cables market is well-positioned to respond to global shifts towards cleaner energy solutions. The anticipated growth in renewable energy sources, coupled with the increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, will assure a sustained demand for various cable types including high, medium, and low voltage cables. As environmental regulations become stricter, market players must adapt to the evolving landscape, reinforcing the importance of innovative materials and technology. Frequently Asked Questions What is the projected growth of the overhead cables market? The overhead cables market is expected to grow by USD 17.8 billion from 2024 to 2028. What factors are driving the demand for overhead cables? Increased electricity consumption from renewable sources and urbanization are primary drivers of demand.

    "text": "Menaces d’attentats en Europe pour Noël et le Nouvel an, la cathédrale de Cologne fouillée Le quotidien allemand Bild affirme que des services de sécurité en Autriche, Allemagne et Espagne ont reçu des indications selon lesquelles un groupe islamiste voudrait commettre plusieurs attentats en Europe, potentiellement à la Saint Sylvestre et à Noël. Dans la foulée, la police allemande a annoncé effectuer samedi soir des fouilles dans la cathédrale de Cologne (ouest) avec des chiens renifleurs, suite à un « avis de danger » émis pour la Saint Sylvestre. « Même si l’information se rapporte à la Saint Sylvestre, nous allons dès ce soir tout mettre en œuvre pour assurer la sécurité des visiteurs de la cathédrale la veille de Noël », a déclaré le chef de la police de Cologne, Michael Esser, cité dans un communiqué. Des messes de Noël visées ? Après la messe du soir et « en accord avec le responsable de la sécurité du chapitre de la cathédrale », la cathédrale a été fouillée avec des chiens renifleurs, a indiqué la police. « Dimanche, tous les visiteurs seront soumis à un contrôle avant d’entrer dans le lieu de culte », est-il précisé dans le communiqué. « La police et le chapitre de la cathédrale recommandent de renoncer aux sacs et d’arriver tôt aux messes », est-il encore écrit. Le quotidien allemand Bild affirme [sur son site internet](https://www.bild.de/regional/koeln/koeln-aktuell/mehrere-festnahmen-islamisten-planten-anschlag-auf-den-koelner-dom-86533072.bild.html) que des services de sécurité en Autriche, Allemagne et Espagne ont reçu des indications selon lesquelles un groupe islamiste voudrait commettre plusieurs attentats en Europe possiblement à la Saint Sylvestre et à Noël. Selon le journal, les cibles de ces attentats pourraient être des messes de Noël à Cologne, Vienne et Madrid. Il affirme également que de premières arrestations par des forces spéciales ont eu lieu samedi à Vienne, ainsi qu’une en Allemagne. Contacté par l’AFP, un responsable de la police de Vienne n’a pas pu confirmer dans l’immédiat une arrestation. La police autrichienne a par ailleurs indiqué samedi qu’elle intensifiait ses surveillances, spécialement autour des églises, des évènements religieux et des marchés de Noël à Vienne. Cinq arrestations en France « Des acteurs terroristes en Europe appellent à mener des attaques contre des évènements chrétiens, spécialement autour du 24 décembre », a-t-elle indiqué dans un communiqué. « En raison de l’évaluation actuelle du risque (…) et du niveau d’alerte terroriste continuellement en hausse, il y a de manière globale un risque accru en Autriche durant les vacances de Noël », poursuit le communiqué. Cette alerte survient quelques jours [après l’arrestation en France de cinq hommes](https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/1412278/article/2023-12-23/ce-que-l-sait-apres-la-grosse-operation-antiterroriste-et-l-arrestation-de-cinq) soupçonnés d’appartenir à la mouvance islamiste. Les services de renseignement ont ouvert une enquête pour association de malfaiteurs terroriste criminelle.",
