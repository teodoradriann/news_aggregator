    "title": "World Animal Day 2024| Wamiqa Gabbi: Animals teach us the art of letting go - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "A proud mother of six dogs, actor Wamiqa Gabbi shares a unique bond with animals and on World Animal Day today, she opens up on her equation with the four-legged beings. “I used to be a non-vegetarian but turned vegetarian over four years ago. The only regret I have is why I didn't do it sooner. The connection I feel with animals now is way more than what I felt a few years ago,” she says.Having six dogs at home—Phoebe, Milli, Julie, Fluki, Gabbar and Momo—who she rescued and adopted during the pandemic, Gabbi insists she creates cherished memories with them every day. “Momo was the latest entry in our family and I rescued and adopted him during the shoot of Fursat (2023). There was this two-week-old puppy who was injured and couldn't drink her mother's milk. I saw that she would die, so I picked her up and brought her home,” she recalls, adding that going to Masai Mara National Reserve remains one of her most memorable experiences. “There were so many different animals like cheetahs, lions, elephants, giraffes, various kinds of cows, and I was just silently watching them. It was just beautiful,” she shares.Ask the 31-year-old what makes animals better companions and she says, “I don't know about that, but I definitely find them better than humans as we have somewhere lost our innocence. Animals still possess that innocence and live with it, and I love that. I learn that from them and try to keep it alive in me every day.” The actor also admits learning how to forgive and forget from animals: “It doesn't matter if you have shouted at them or they have done a mistake, they won't hurt you in any way. The next time you call them, they will come back to you with as much love. It's such an impactful message that they teach you about letting go, forgiving and forgetting. All they want to do is love you and I just wish humans could understand that.”Being an animal lover, Gabbi feels hurt when she sees atrocities against animals, and calls for stringent action. “Since childhood, we have been taught to love and be kind and respectful. But as we grew up, we forgot all those important teachings. How would you feel if you saw a video of someone beating a child? That's how I feel when I see videos of humans' bad behaviour towards animals. India is a secular country, and I am sure none of the religions teach us to be violent towards animals,” she asserts, calling out the need for stronger laws: “If you don't consider violence against animals a crime, that's dangerous. If somebody can kill, beat or molest an innocent animal, how can you trust that person to be safer in our society or around children?”The actor requests people to just “love animals”. “Once you have love, you will automatically give them food, shelter during rain and clothes during winters,” she says, admitting that she hopes to have an animal farm in future one day. “An image that keeps coming to me is that if I have an animal farm, I want to sleep with my head on a cow's tummy. That's an experience I really want to have in my life,” she ends.",

This month, the Little Kinder Knights put the Virtue of Generosity into action by making over 200 sandwiches for the Friars ministry to be distributed to those in need.\nAt Holy Family, students learn that as disciples of Jesus Christ, GENEROSITY comes from the heart, so it is not how big the gift is that matters, but rather the value it has to the person who gave it. Christ lived it. He was always giving of his time, listening, and helping others.\n“During this season of Advent and Christmas, as everyone prepare for the birth of the Lord, HFS remind its students to be thankful for all the beautiful gifts God has given us and, in turn, to give to those less fortunate. To enjoy the time we are blessed with when gathering with family and friends”.\nIf you would like to learn more about the Poor of Jesus Christ LA religious community, visit\nhttps://pjcfriars.org.\nHoly Family Catholic School instills Christian values and Catholic principles in students through the Gospel message of Jesus Christ; Faith, Community, Service and Excellence.\nHoly Family School, 1301 Rollin St., South Pasadena, (626) 799-4354 or visit\nschool.holyfamily.org.",

    "text": "Neptune City, NJ, May 03, 2024 --( PR.com )-- A.J. Freda, a retired police officer and lover of military history who served on two destroyers during the Cuban Missile Crisis and holds a criminal justice degree, has completed his new book, “The Purple Rose”: a gripping wartime novel that centers around Rosie Favor, a nurse who is sent to the Philippines and rises to the occasion to take on risk and join the fight in service of others.\nFreda shares, “What is the meaning of the purple rose? It is more than a lovely flower that adds beauty to the world. Rare in nature, the flower is incredibly unique, much like the main character in this story, Rosie Favor. The qualities that make Rosie so special are her love of people and her hatred of oppression. She is inspired to take incredible action and personal risks in numerous conflicts to benefit freedom-loving people. This character is given the code name Purple Rose because she is as rare in nature as the flower itself. Motivated by her loathing of the Japanese war machine, this beautiful nurse will be transformed into the Mata Hari of the Second World War.\n“As you turn the pages of this book and journey with Rosie as she faces each conflict, you will discover her many talents layered like the petals of a rose, unassuming in beauty and deep in humility.”\nPublished by Newman Springs Publishing, A.J. Freda’s enthralling tale will transport readers as they discover Rosie’s incredible courage and sacrifice, leaving them spellbound as she finds herself taking on greater risk and danger. Expertly paced and full of suspense, Freda weaves a stunningly human and heartfelt story that is sure to resonate with readers from all walks of life, remaining with them long after its shocking conclusion.\nReaders who wish to experience this inspiring work can purchase “The Purple Rose” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iBooks Store, Amazon, or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Newman Springs Publishing at 732-243-8512.\nAbout Newman Springs Publishing:\nNewman Springs Publishing is a full-service publishing house for serious authors.

    "text": "कैलास यात्रा- पार्ट 9: अपने ही कैलास से विदेशी बनकर लौटने का त्रास\nमन ज्ञान के परे भाग रहा था. सीमाओं में बंटी भूमि हमसे छूटी जा रही थी. हम अपने ही देव की धरा को अब अपना नहीं कह सकते. श्रद्धालु बनकर आए थे, परदेसी बनकर लौटने के लिए विवश थे. हमारा कैलास हमसे छूटा जा रहा था.\nतिब्बत के सवाल पर हमारे देश ने न जाने किस मजबूरी में भयंकर गलती की. बाद में इसे ही हिमालयन ब्लंडर कहा गया. जो मुहावरा बन गया. अब लाख चाहकर भी उसे सुधारा नहीं जा सकता. तिब्बत पहले भारत और चीन के बीच एक प्राकृतिक दीवार था, बफर जोन. अब तिब्बत का अस्तित्व मिट जाने के बाद चीन हमारे सिर पर खड़ा मिलता है.\nउत्तराखंड के चमोली से लेकर अरुणाचल के तवांग तक उसकी सड़कें भारतीय सीमा को छूती हैं. इस सरहद पर हर रोज हम चीनी घुसपैठ की खबरें पढ़ते हैं. हर साल पांच सौ से ज्यादा घटनाएं भारतीय सीमा में चीनी घुसपैठ और उत्पात की होती हैं. लॉक डाऊन के दौरान चीन सैनिक लद्दाख की पैग्यांग घाटी में घुस गए थे. सीमा पर दोनों ओर जबरदस्त जमाव रहता है.\nजो बोया उसे ही काट रहे हैं\nहमने जो बोया उसे ही काट रहे हैं. यह गलती क्यों हुई? इस सवाल का जवाब किसी के पास नहीं है. जब जवाहरलाल नेहरू ने सन् 1935 में तिब्बत को स्वतंत्र देश कहा तो फिर चीनी हमले के बाद उनका रवैया क्यों बदला? हमले के बाद नेहरू ने भी वही कहा, जो माओत्से तुंग का दावा था. दोनों ने तिब्बत को चीन का आंतरिक मामला कहा. हम हिंदी-चीनी भाई-भाई का राग अलाप रहे थे और चीन धोखे से हम पर हमले की तैयारी कर रहा था. हमला किया भी. हम हारे.\nनत्थी वीजा पर यात्रा हुई जारी\nवर्ष 1962 में चीनी हमले का असर मानसरोवर यात्रा पर पड़ा. चीन ने यात्रा पर रोक लगा दी. हम अपने कैलास से वंचित हुए. 1977 में जब जनता पार्टी की सरकार बनी तो उसके विदेश मंत्री अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी ने कैलास मानसरोवर यात्रा खोलने के लिए चीन सरकार से कई दौर की बात की. सरकार चली गई, पर डॉ सुब्रह्मण्यम स्वामी इस कोशिश में लगे रहे.\nउनकी अथक कोशिशों के बाद तब के वाइस प्रीमियर देंग शियाओ पेंग की सरकार ने यात्रा के लिए विशेष परमिट जारी करने की इजाजत दी. बीस यात्रियों का पहला जत्था डॉ सुब्रह्मण्यम स्वामी के नेतृत्व में ही कैलास गया. उसमें हरीश रावत भी थे. तब से यह यात्रा जारी है, पर एक खास परमिट पर, जिसे नत्थी वीजा कहते हैं.\nभारत और तिब्बतियों के रिश्ते\nआज भी भारत से आए लोगों के प्रति तिब्बतियों में सहज आत्मीयता होती है, उम्मीद भी. तकलाकोट में हम अपने तिब्बती ड्राइवर दोरजी से चीनी उत्पीड़न की कथा सुनने की कोशिश कर रहे थे. वे कुछ-कुछ बता भी रहे थे. बातचीत में उन्हें पता चला कि मैं बनारस का हूं. रिनपोछेजी को जानता हूं. उनसे मिला हूं. दोरजी का व्यवहार एकदम बदल गया. वह मेरे हाथ चूमने लगे. उनकी आंखों में झर-झर आंसू थे. ढलती शाम के एकांत में दूर ले जाकर वह मुझसे सारनाथ और रिनपोछे के बारे में पूछने लगे. तिब्बती हारारकी में रिनपोछे दलाईलामा के बाद आते हैं. तब रिनपोछे जी तिब्बत की निर्वासित सरकार के प्रधान मंत्री थे.\nजब मैंने उन्हें बताया कि मैं दलाई लामा से भी मिला हूं, तो वह चमत्कृत हो एकदम मुझे देखने लगे. यकायक मेरे सामने साष्टांग लेट गए. मैं सकते में था. तिब्बत की इस पीढ़ी ने दलाई लामा को नहीं देखा है, केवल सुना और पढ़ा है. दलाई लामा उनके लिए किंवदंती हैं. दलाई लामा उनके देवता हैं. वह शायद मुझमें देवदूत देखने लगे.\nकुछ ही दूर पर चीनी सैनिक खड़े थे. यहां दलाई लामा की बात करना, फोटो रखना बगावत समझा जाता है और सजा का प्रावधान है. मैं भयभीत हुआ. अजीब मुसीबत गले पड़ी. मैंने उसे उठाया, गले से लगाया, समझाया; पर लगातार इस बात का ध्यान रख रहा था कि उस सैनिक को कुछ समझ में न आए. मैंने दोरजी को समझाया, “रिनपोछे जी बचपन से हमें जानते हैं. वे मेरे घर आते रहे हैं. मेरे पिता के अनन्य मित्रों में हैं. वे मेरी शादी की बारात में गए थे. हम आने से पहले उनसे बात करके आए हैं, जाकर फिर बात करेंगे.\nदोरजी भावुक हो चले. वे समझ के पार चले गए थे. मुझे वहीं खड़ा कर कहीं गुम हो गए. मैं गाड़ी के पास चीनी सैनिकों पर नजर रखे खड़ा था. तब तक कुछ सैनिक और आ गए थे. थोड़ी ही देर में उस निर्जन स्थान में न जाने कहां से 20-25 लामा एक साथ और प्रकट हो गए. कोई मेरा हाथ चूम रहा था, कोई माथा. कोई मुझसे अपनी माला स्पर्श करा रहा था. कोई खुद स्पर्श कर भाव-विभोर हो रहा था. मेरे लिए यह अजीब उलझन भरी स्थिति थी.\nदलाई लामा के प्रति समर्पण\nमैं आया था यहां दर्शनार्थी बनकर और वे मेरे ही दर्शन कर कृतकृत्य हो रहे हैं. उनकी आस्था देख मेरी बेचैनी और बढ़ रही थी. मेरी मनःस्थिति गाइड फिल्म के देवानंद की तरह हो रही थी. जो था नहीं वह समझ लिया गया था. दलाई लामा और रिनपोछे सहित अपने शीर्ष धार्मिक नेताओं के प्रति ऐसा समर्पण देख मुझे लगा, अब मैं यहां से खिसक लूं, वरना भावुकता में लामा कुछ भी कर सकते हैं. कहीं चीनी सैनिक मुझे भेदिया या घुसपैठिया न समझ लें, जिस पर लामा बिरादरी लट्टू है. घबराहट में लंबे-लंबे डग भरता मैं रेस्ट हाउस में लौट आया. लेकिन अपने नेताओं के लिए उनकी यह आस्था मुझे रास्ते भर झकझोरती रही.\nमौजूदा दलाई लामा तेनजिन ग्यात्सो 14वें दलाई लामा हैं. लामा व्यवस्था में दलाई लामा ही तिब्बत के राष्ट्राध्यक्ष होते हैं और आध्यात्मिक गुरु भी. चीनी हमले से पहले तिब्बत में यही व्यवस्था लागू थी. दलाई लामा मंगोलियाई पदवी है, जिसका मतलब है ज्ञान का सागर. तिब्बत में दलाई लामा को बुद्ध का अवतार मानते हैं, इस लिहाज से वर्तमान दलाई लामा बुद्ध के 74वें अवतार हैं.\nवे तिब्बत के लोगों की वास्तविक आवाज हैं. दुनिया भर में तिब्बती उनकी पूजा करते हैं. लोगों की ऐसी श्रद्धा पूरी दुनिया में किसी और जीवित व्यक्ति के लिए नहीं दिखती. आज भी तिब्बत में उनका सम्मान सिर्फ सर्वोच्च धार्मिक नेता का नहीं है, लोग उन पर मर-मिटने को तैयार हैं. इन दिनों दलाई लामा के वारिस की खोज शुरू हो गयी है. चीन और दलाई लामा समर्थकों में इस मुद्दे पर टकराव है. चीन दलाई लामा का वारिस खुद चुनना चाहता है. पर दलाई लामा अपना उत्तराधिकारी खुद चुनने वाले हैं . परम्परा यही है. चीन अपना कठपुतली दलाई लामा चाहता है.\nहमारा कैलास हमसे छूटा जा रहा था\nबौद्ध धर्म की महायान शाखा को माननेवाला तिब्बती समाज मूलत: यायावर प्रकृति का रहा है. धीरे-धीरे इसका विकास एक ऐसे समाज के रूप में हुआ, जहां भूमि तो राज्य की थी, पर वह संपत्ति के रूप में सरकार, मठों और अभिजात वर्गों के पास थी. मन ज्ञान के परे भाग रहा था. सीमाओं में बंटी भूमि हमसे छूटी जा रही थी. हम अपने ही देव की धरा को अब अपना नहीं कह सकते. श्रद्धालु बनकर आए थे, परदेसी बनकर लौटने के लिए विवश थे. हमारा कैलास हमसे छूटा जा रहा था. जय जय…\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट- 1: सशरीर स्वर्ग देखने का पहला सोपान\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट-2: सांसों की माला में सिमरूं मैं शिव का नाम\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट-3: चीनी सिपाही और नमकीन चाय\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट-4: कैलास का पहला दर्शन और देवताओं का स्नान\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट-5: अपना तर्पण और पुरखों की सात पीढ़ियां\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट-6: कैलास की बौद्ध, सनातन परंपरा और माओ की मार\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा पार्ट-7: शेषनाग, संगतराश कुदरत और कैलास परिक्रमा\nये भी पढ़ें- कैलास यात्रा- पार्ट 8: दमनकारी चीन और 75 साल से जुल्म सहता तिब्बत",

    "text": "The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office has reported the arrest of four individuals following an incident on Christmas Eve at a local church in Varick. The incident occurred around 5:58 p.m. when Christopher A. Avila, Jeremy S. Mathias, Daniel J. Watson, and Nathan J. Jackson allegedly trespassed and disrupted a church service on Ernsberger Road by voicing negative comments about Christianity. The deputies responded promptly to the report apprehending the suspects at approximately 6:51 p.m. without any further incident. Upon investigation, all four suspects were charged with disruption of religious service, conspiracy, and trespassing. They were taken to the Seneca County Law Enforcement Center for processing. The arrest operation involved collaboration between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office, New York State Police, and Waterloo Police Department. The accused have been released on appearance tickets and are scheduled to appear at the Varick Town Court at a later date to address the charges.
