    "text": "[Salesforcecom](/user/salesforcecom)on Thu, 02/29/2024 - 14:39 Today, Salesforce announced 15 grantees of its Catalyst Fund , which provides unrestricted capital to smaller and younger nonprofits focused on increasing access to quality education and advancing climate justice. Today, Salesforce announced 15 grantees of its [Catalyst Fund](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-catalyst-fund-announcement/?amp) , which provides unrestricted capital to smaller and younger nonprofits focused on increasing access to quality education and advancing climate justice. Why it matters: Disparities in education quality remain a [significant challenge](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/wp19-06-v082022.pdf) , limiting socioeconomic opportunities for many individuals. Climate change also impacts the [most vulnerable communities](https://www.un.org/ohrlls/news/frontline-climate-crisis-worlds-most-vulnerable-nations-suffer-disproportionately) . These grants are helping smaller, younger organizations grow their programs and reach new audiences, innovate for solutions and test big ideas, and secure additional funding. - [Rese](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/effective_change_requires_proximate_leaders) [arch](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/effective_change_requires_proximate_leaders)shows that organizations with leaders embedded in the communities they serve have the experience, relationships, data, and knowledge necessary to develop effective solutions. - Nonprofits with unrestricted funding also demonstrate [greater resilience and capacity](https://cep.org/the-impact-of-large-unrestricted-grants-on-nonprofits-a-five-year-view/). This flexibility allows them to create and scale solutions by allocating resources to operational costs, technology, and outreach efforts. Go deeper: Salesforce’s latest round of funding will allocate a total of $2 million to nonprofits to support 15 organizations across the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. - The fund has also extended its reach to include three organizations with a specific focus on climate justice to build the next generation of climate leaders and advance a just transition to a green economy. - With these latest contributions, the Catalyst Fund will have awarded a cumulative total of $6 million to 50 nonprofit partners since 2021. What they’re saying: - “We’re proud to support these exceptional organizations, recognizing that getting access to philanthropic capital is often harder for younger and smaller nonprofits. We’ve seen the transformative impact of our education Catalyst Fund partners and we’re thrilled to broaden our reach to support climate justice organizations.” – Becky Ferguson, SVP of Philanthropy at Salesforce & CEO of the Salesforce Foundation - “The transition to clean energy is inevitable, but creating an equitable distribution of benefits takes intention. With unrestricted funding, I have greater capacity to focus on the most impactful work with young clean energy leaders instead of worrying about how to cover the core operations that are always so difficult for nonprofits.” – Esther Morales, Catalyst Fund Grantee and Executive Director, CELI We’ve seen the transformative impact of our education Catalyst Fund partners and we’re thrilled to broaden our reach to support climate justice organizations.Becky Ferguson, SVP of Philanthropy at Salesforce & CEO of the Salesforce Foundation New Catalyst Fund grantees: These 15 grantees are committed to driving access to education and economic opportunity and advancing climate justice in the communities they serve: - [America On Tech](https://www.americaontech.org/): Grew its tech sector partnerships, resulting in over $1.5 million in internship wages for students in the 2022-2023 school year.

    "title": "Juicio contra Alperovich por abuso sexual: un fiscal acusó a un testigo de haber mentido y pidió su detención",
    "text": "En el marco del [juicio contra el exgobernador de Tucumán José Alperovich, acusado por abuso sexual](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/manzur-declaro-en-el-juicio-contra-alperovich-esto-le-debe-haber-causado-mucho-dolor-a-ella/), este jueves el fiscal Sandro Abraldes pidió la inmediata detención del empresario Víctor Hugo Decataldo por falso testimonio. Es un testigo que trabajó con el también exsenador durante su campaña a gobernador del 2019. Para el fiscal, “mintió descaradamente” en su declaración. La acusación se dio luego de mostrar conversaciones de él con la presunta víctima. Decataldo es un empresario tucumano que en el 2018 inició su relación política con [Alperovich](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/manzur-declaro-en-el-juicio-contra-alperovich-esto-le-debe-haber-causado-mucho-dolor-a-ella/), al incorporarse al equipo de campaña. Tiempo después, comenzó una relación amorosa con Sara, la hija de Alperovich, convirtiéndose en una persona muy cercana al senador. Para el fiscal, el hombre mintió en su testimonio. Lo descubrió a partir de los chats que fueron incorporados al expediente. De hecho, el empresario habría “armado una estrategia” en el 2019 para obtener información de la denunciante. “Yo quería saber qué había pasado en relación a esa denuncia. No tenía mucha relación con ella, mi relación era más con Sarita, la hija de Alperovich. Yo la veía mal porque se rumoreaba que esta chica iba a hacer una denuncia contra su padre. Entonces armé una estrategia para que ella hablara”, indicó. El hombre dijo ante el juez Ramos Padilla que “intentó tener empatía” con la mujer. “Ella me contó que estaba sufriendo una situación difícil y le contesté: ‘José es un animal, parece un alzado’. Intenté tener empatía con ella, decirle que sí a todo e inventé cosas. Fue una mala idea que se me ocurrió, pido disculpas”. En los chats, la denunciante le reconoció al testigo que estaba siendo abusada por Alperovich, a lo que él le respondió: “Yo te creo, también fui violado”. Pero durante el debate, el hombre indicó que ella “jamás le había dicho nada” sobre un supuesto ataque sexual. “Podría haber plata de por medio, jaja”, le puso Decataldo a la denunciante en esa conversación por se llevó adelante por Instagram. “Fue una broma, no lo dije en serio”, se justificó el testigo en el debate. Tras esto, el fiscal lo acusó y pidió su detención inmediata: “Usted juró ante el tribunal que iba a decir la verdad, pero está mintiendo descaradamente”. La querella asintió al pedido, por lo que será considerado por el juez al final del testimonio. “El testigo nunca dijo que esto se trataba de una estrategia para manipular a la denunciante. Recién lo trajo a colación en esta instancia. Mintió”, expresó uno de los abogados de la querella. “Víctor Decataldo contaba con información de afuera. Queda claro que calló deliberadamente en la primera declaración testimonial. Queda claro que lo único que hay genuino son esos chats. Lo que él sabe de este caso, está en ese chat, no lo que fue a exponer en Tucumán ni lo que vino a exponer acá”, insistió luego Abraldes. El juez Ramos Padilla decidió esperar al final del debate para resolver: “No veo la necesidad de pronunciarme ahora. Lo voy a hacer al final del juicio, es lo más produnte. Voy a escuchar a más testigos”.",

    "text": "La quasi-totalité des pompiers du Rhône, y compris les cadres, sont en “grève illimitée” pour demander plus de moyens financiers et humains à leurs autorités de tutelle : État, Métropole de Lyon et conseil départemental.\n“Le SDIS du Qatar.” La boutade a circulé pleins gaz pendant des années en interne, tant les sapeurs-pompiers lyonnais disposaient de gros moyens financiers, de belles casernes, de bons engins avant tout le monde et parmi les meilleures techniques opérationnelles du pays. Retour de flammes. L’incendie a pris. Le torchon brûle désormais entre les pompiers et leurs “financeurs”, la Métropole de Lyon, le Département du Rhône et, indirectement, l’État : les caisses se vident, personne n’arrive plus vraiment à les remplir et, classique, chacun se renvoie la lance. “On est au centre d’une guéguerre politique”, commente Anthony Fossat, le commandant adjoint au chef de groupement Est des sapeurs-pompiers du Service départemental métropolitain d’incendie et de secours (SDMIS) et délégué Avenir Secours, syndicat majoritaire de l’encadrement des pompiers. “Nous, notre rôle c’est de sauver les gens, d’éteindre des incendies, pas d’aller chercher des financements, c’est le job des politiques !” , cuirasse Rémy Chabbouh, pompier et secrétaire général du syndicat Sud des pompiers locaux.\nLa colère gronde, la tension est à son maximum. Depuis le 1er octobre, 90 % des sapeurs-pompiers, officiers compris, sont ainsi en “grève illimitée”. Ils déplorent le manque de moyens, les recrutements et demandent des hausses de salaires. Pour l’instant, les secours sont assurés, mais le doute s’installe.\nLes pompiers du Rhône en chiffres\nLes effectifs baissent, le nombre d’interventions explose\nEn 2014, les 1 170 pompiers professionnels de Lyon et de la métropole intervenaient 90 000 fois par an.\nDix ans plus tard, 1 070 pompiers (-100) interviennent 140 000 fois par an (+55,5 %)\nLe délai moyen d’intervention des pompiers à Lyon et dans la métropole est passé de 10 minutes en 2017 à 12 minutes 40 en 2024\n100 casernes\npour 1 889 300 habitants dans 266 communes\n6 490\nsapeurs-pompiers (dont 20 % de professionnels) et\n350 personnels, administratifs et spécialisés\n1 appel d’urgence/minute\n1 intervention toutes les 4 minutes\n269 prises en charge de victimes par jour\nIl vous reste 69 % de l'article à lire.\nArticle réservé à nos abonnés.",

This collaborative effort focuses on educational development, technological innovation and community engagement, says Joey Marchand, a CBDI assistant and partnership coordinator. Marchand worked with Aaron Krapes, UW Esports Club president, and EWC Esports Head Coach Caleb Spitzer. The initiative is designed to encourage esports club and team members to enhance academic offerings at both institutions while contributing to Wyoming’s economic diversification by cultivating a skilled workforce in high-tech fields, Marchand says. “This collaboration aims to create unprecedented opportunities for students in the realms of competitive gaming and emerging technologies,” Marchand says. He says students, educators and industry partners are invited to join the venture, which aims to involve more Wyoming community colleges and schools in the future. “This cooperative effort will allow us to continue to grow the esports community at UW and across the state of Wyoming,” Krapes says. “It will also give us the opportunity to assist other colleges and high schools in developing their esports programs, with the goal of stimulating academic engagement and, most importantly, enjoying the many benefits that competitive esports allow.” In a news release issued by EWC Esports, Spitzer expressed enthusiasm for the partnership's potential impact on the state. “Esports has the incredible potential to not only reach students who might otherwise miss out on traditional sports, but to equip students to take their experiences, merging teamwork and technology, back into Wyoming,” Spitzer says. He adds that as more schools and colleges include these programs, the benefits for the state as a whole grow exponentially. Steve Lupien, the Ada Lovelace Director of CBDI, says the center is sponsoring the UW esports club’s partnership. It represents a forward-thinking approach to education and technology, combining the competitive spirit of esports with the innovative potential of blockchain and digital technologies, he says. “It aims to position Wyoming as a hub for esports excellence and technological innovation, potentially attracting new talent and industries to the state,” Lupien says. “Esports has shown that it connects students to academic programs and careers in computer science, cybersecurity, AI, robotics and blockchain.” This initiative comes at a time when both esports and blockchain technologies are seeing rapid growth and increased interest from various sectors, he says. “By joining forces, these Wyoming institutions are positioning themselves at the forefront of these emerging fields,” Lupien says. UW will participate in the EWC Fortnite Invitational Saturday, Oct. 19, starting at noon in the EWC game room. The event is in partnership with the Wyoming Army National Guard and will include teams from other Wyoming community colleges and high schools. A 2017 UW graduate, 1st Lt. Garrett Stanfill, head of the Wyoming Guard esports program, helped arrange the competition. Sponsored by CBDI, the, the event can be viewed on the official EWC Twitch stream at [https://www.twitch.tv/ewcesports](https://www.twitch.tv/ewcesports).

    "text": "FOX 2 - It's hard to not overindulge this time of the year - and for the most part that can just lead to a little discomfort, but in some cases, all the treats, along with booze or caffeine, can lead to some real heart issues.\nIt can be easy to overindulge at holiday parties you’re catching up with family and friends, eating all kinds of delicious food, and the alcohol may be flowing freely too.\nDoctor Deborah Plate with Cleveland Clinic explains, it’s best to keep moderation in mind.\n\"We can overindulge with lots of goodies that might be a lot different than what we typically do throughout the year,\" she said. \"So, a lot of times we will take in quite a bit of salt, quite a bit of sugar, and certainly along with that during the holidays can be overindulging with alcohol.\n\"And when all that comes at us, we certainly can, at times, find that perhaps we don't feel good. Some folks might realize that they actually have perhaps racing heart or chest discomfort, shortness of breath.\"\nDoctor Plate says the condition is known as ‘Holiday Heart Syndrome’ and it can be caused by too much alcohol and salty foods. Those with existing heart issues are considered most at risk.\nHowever, anyone can be diagnosed with it. Doctor Plate says if you do start to experience any of the symptoms she mentioned, like a racing heart, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath, you should stop drinking immediately.\nHoliday Heart Syndrome usually resolves on its own but, if symptoms persist, you should go to the emergency department.\n\"Things to think about, or look for, are chest discomfort,\" Plate said. \"I don't always say chest pain because oftentimes it's pressure or discomfort. And so, anything that's different than normal is important. heartburn that does not improve with something over the counter in the way of an antacid needs to be investigated. shortness of breath, it's different than usual.\n\"I often talk to my patients about walking across a flat surface and are you short of breath? We all get a little shorter breath with stairs, but a flat surface shortness of breath concerns me.\"\nPlate says if you do plan to drink alcohol at a holiday party, be sure to pace yourself and switch off with some water.\nYou could also eat less during the day so you can eat more at the party or eat right before so you’re less tempted to overindulge.\nHealth Works Sponsored by Corewell Health",
