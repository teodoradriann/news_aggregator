    "title": "Copa Del Rey, Round of 16: Atletico Madrid beat city rivals Real 4-2 after ET to seal quarterfinal spot - Sportstar",
    "text": "Atletico Madrid got the better of Real Madrid this time, beating its crosstown rival 4-2 in extra time Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey.\nAntoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme scored after a 2-2 draw in regulation to send Atletico to the last eight less than a week after it lost to Madrid in the semifinals of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.\nAtletico thrived again at home, where it also beat Madrid in the first Spanish league derby of the season in September in what had been its rival’s only loss this season. Atletico is unbeaten in 25 consecutive matches at its Metropolitano stadium in all competitions, with two draws since a 1-0 league defeat to Barcelona in January 2023.\nMadrid eliminated Atletico in the Copa quarterfinals last season, winning 3-1 in extra time at home. The city rivals will play again on Feb. 4 — the third meeting in less than a month — in the Spanish league at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Madrid won 5-3 in extra time in the Super Cup semifinals last Wednesday.\nGriezmann secured Atletico’s win this time with a beautiful goal after making a run through the right side of the area. The France international, Atletico’s all-time top scorer with 175 goals, got past Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior before finding the top corner from a tight angle.\nVoting lines now open for Sportstar ACES Awards 2024\nRiquelme sealed Atletico’s win from inside the area on a breakaway in the 119th after an assist by Memphis Depay.\nAtletico had opened the scoring with a goal from close range by Samuel Lino after Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger deflected the ball backward into the area in the 39th. Madrid equalized after a rare mistake by Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who punched the ball into his own net while trying to clear a cross.\nÁlvaro Morata put Atletico ahead again from close range in the 57th after Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin failed to fully clear a cross. The ball bounced off Rüdiger and went toward Morata in front of an open net.\nStriker Joselu, who came on for Rodrygo in the 80th, equalized with a header in the 82nd after a cross by Jude Bellingham. Morata had missed a clear chance in a one-on-one situation with Lunin just moments earlier.\nBrahim Díaz thought he had scored an equalizer late in extra time but the goal was disallowed because of an offside by Bellingham.\nBellingham hit the crossbar early in the first half, and Rodrygo struck the woodwork in the second.\nMadrid went on to win the Spanish Super Cup 4-1 in the final against Barcelona on Sunday, but there was no guard of honor by Atletico before the match at the Metropolitano.\nThere were reports in Spanish media that some Atletico fans called Vinícius a monkey before the game. The Brazil international had been racially abused by Atletico fans before other derbies, including by some who hanged an effigy of the player off a highway bridge last year.\nSimeone exchanged a few heated words with Vinícius after the end of regulation. The coach appeared to be upset with Vinícius because of his celebration after Joselu’s goal.\nCarlo Ancelotti’s Madrid had come into the game on an unbeaten run of 21 matches in all competitions, with 17 wins and four draws.\nBarcelona picked up the pace in the second half to beat third-division club Unionistas 3-1 in its round-of-16 match.\nIt will be the second straight last-eight appearance for the Catalan club, which arrived under pressure after losing the Spanish Super Cup final to Madrid.\nAfter being held 1-1 at halftime, Barcelona improved in the second half to secure the victory with goals by Jules Koundé and Alejandro Balde.\nALSO READ: Onana under pressure after late arrival to Cameroon squad\nThe hosts had taken the lead with a beautiful one-timer by Álvaro Gómez in the 31st minute before Ferran Torres equalized for Barcelona on a breakaway in the 45th. Koundé scored with a long-range shot in the 69th and Balde sealed the victory with a strike from a tight angle in the 73rd.\n“After a tough loss in the Super Cup we needed to rebound,” Koundé said. “It wasn’t easy, they have a good team and were very motivated.”\nUnionistas had a few chances to move closer toward the end, but Barcelona goalkeeper Iñaki Peña made some good saves to maintain the comfortable lead at the 5,000-capacity Reina Sofia Stadium.\nBarcelona defender Pau Cubarsí, 16, made his first-team debut by entering the match after halftime to replace Andreas Christensen.\nBarcelona is seeking its first Copa title since 2021. It was eliminated by Madrid in last year’s semifinals. The Catalan club is the Copa’s most successful team with 31 titles.\nUnionistas had eliminated Villarreal on penalties in the previous round. Its best Copa campaign so far had been a round-of-32 appearance in 2020, when it lost to Real Madrid.\nGirona, Celta Vigo and Real Sociedad reached the quarterfinals on Wednesday, while Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao and Mallorca advanced on Tuesday.\nComments\nRelated Topics Copa del Rey /\nAtletico Madrid /\nReal Madrid /\nJan Oblak /\nAntoine Griezmann /\nAlvaro Morata\nLatest on Sportstar Copa Del Rey, Round of 16: Atletico beats Real Madrid 4-2 in extra time a week after Super Cup loss Team Sportstar FIH Women’s Olympic Qualifiers: What does India need to do to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics?

    "title": "Government announces salary hike for guest lecturers, health insurance and retirement benefit - The Hindu",
    "text": "The Karnataka government has decided to revise the remuneration for guest faculty working in various government first-grade colleges, government engineering colleges and polytechnic colleges across the State by up to ₹5,000 per month and give a lump sum amount of about ₹5 lakh as a retirement benefit if they have served for at least 10 years. Health insurance of ₹5 lakh has also been assured.\nNow, guest lecturers are getting remuneration on the basis of their educational qualification and seniority, from a minimum ₹26,000 to ₹32,000 per month. With the revision, they will get ₹31,000 to ₹37,000 per month, effective from January 2024.\nSpeaking at a press conference after holding a meeting with guest lecturers at Vikas Soudha, Higher Education Minister Dr. M.C. Sudhakar said the guest lecturers have been protesting since November 23, 2023, for the fulfilment of many demands, including being made permanent. This has affected academic activities in colleges. The revision will be applicable to all the guest lecturers working under the Collegiate Education Department and Technical Education Department.\nOn health insurance, he said if the premium of ₹400 per month is paid by the guest lecturers, the government will pay the remaining premium amount. “Including increasing of remuneration, health insurance and retirement benefit for the guest lecturers, a total of ₹ 132 crores will be burden for the government,” Dr. Sudhakar said.\n5% weightage To help them in future government recruitments, he added that 5% weightage would be given to guest lecturers based on seniority who have served for about ten years while recruiting assistant professors in the collegiate education department and technical education department. The government also decided to provide one day’s leave per month to the guest lecturers with 15 hours per week.\nEarlier, the BJP government had said they could not retain the services of guest lecturers as per the report given by the expert committee during the salary hike. There are many legal complications. But our government has honestly fulfilled their other fair demands. So, the guest lecturers should give up their strike and report to work from January 1. If it fails, the government will take strict action. Also, around 30 thousand applied for the post of guest lecturer this year, and we have around 10,000 second list of guest lecturers. He warned that if the guest lecturers continued their strike, the government would definitely appoint the guest lecturers, who are on the second list of selection.\nProtest to continue Despite the hike, the guest faculties are not happy with the government’s decision. However, the Government First Grade Colleges Guest Lecturers’ Association has decided to continue the protest. Speaking to The Hindu , association president Hanumanthagowda R. Kalmani said their major demand is job security, which has not been met. “We will hold padayatra from Siddaganga Mutt to Bengaluru on January 1, 2024,” he said.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "text": "“Estoy terminando de caer y entender cómo fue todo. La verdad es que recibimos muchas señales para darnos cuenta de que se trataba de una estafa , pero en ese momento no las vimos”. Así comenzó su relato Luciano García, un joven periodista que hace unos días vio como los ahorros de su vida se esfumaban en cuestión de segundos , víctima de un complejo fraude digital.\nEn diálogo con TN Tecno , García explicó que el engaño se originó a partir de una oferta de unos muebles que su madre publicó para vender en Marketplace . “Eran unas sillas y una mesa que mi mamá necesitaba sacarse de encima por una mudanza”. Con aceitados métodos de ingeniería social, excusas y explicaciones varias y llamados fraudulentos de personas que se hacían pasar por otras, los ciberdelincuentes involucraron a la familia de Luciano y les robaron millones de pesos.\nLeé también: Estafas digitales: guía para saber cómo actuar en caso de sufrir un engaño virtual\nA la oferta publicada por Marcela, la madre de Luciano, le apareció un posible comprador. Se presentó en la plataforma de Facebook y aseguró que le interesaban los muebles y tenía la plata para adquirirlos. “Mi mamá arregló en recibir 100 mil pesos transferencia, como adelanto, y 100 mil pesos en mano cuando el supuesto comprador viera los muebles y se los llevara”, explicó García.\nLos ciberdelincuentes tienen muy aceitados los métodos y tácticas para engañar a las personas. (Imagen: AdobeStock) Sin embargo, la primera señal de la estafa ocurrió cuando Santiago, el supuesto comprador, le envió un comprobante de la transferencia y un mensaje en el que explicaba, casi suplicando, que su madre les había enviado, por error, 1.200.000 pesos. Es decir, un millón cien mil pesos más de lo que habían pactado como adelanto.\nEsta táctica es muy común en fraudes digitales. Los ciberdelincuentes imitan los comprobantes de los bancos y asumen el lugar de damnificados. A partir de entonces, a la víctima real la apuran para devolver el supuesto dinero enviado de más y por equivocación. El mecanismo está estudiado . Simulan llantos, pedidos desesperados y todo tipo de excusas. En este caso, del otro lado le explicaron que ya habían hecho la denuncia al banco y que para activar la devolución, desde la entidad se iban a comunicar con ella. Pero todo es falso.\nEl comprobante enviado, la transferencia, la excusa y el llamado del banco forman parte del plan para que la víctima, en algún momento, caiga y empiece a hacer caso en lo que los ciberdelincuentes le piden.\nLeé también: Consejos de ciberseguridad: 12 recomendaciones de un experto para evitar caer en estafas digitales\n“Mi mamá, desesperada porque queríamos vender los muebles, recibió el llamado de un tal Carlos, supuestamente del Banco Galicia, quien le dijo que iban a simular préstamos en su cuenta para verificar si con el límite diario de transferencia se podía devolver la plata que supuestamente le habían enviado”, contó García a TN Tecno . “Ahí fue cuando mi mamá me pidió ayuda, les pasó mi teléfono y se comunicaron conmigo”, agregó. Su madre le pidió que siguiera las instrucciones del banco. Y Luciano accedió.\n“Cuando me llamaron, yo estaba ocupado en otra cosa, salí de la oficina y bajé la guardia con tal de ayudar a mi vieja y que se pudiera sacar el problema encima”. El ciberdelincuente aseguró que la cuenta de su mamá estaba en revisión, y por ese motivo, necesitaba el otro CBU.\nA esa altura, en la mayoría de los engaños, los argumentos falsos son tantos que cualquier persona normal se pierde y se confunde. Así, con palabras, muchas vueltas, explicaciones de operatorias bancarias y demás, el ciberdelincuente, logra que la víctima, cansada y desorientada, transfiera dinero de su homebanking a otras cuentas o a su billetera en Mercado Pago.\n“Me explicó que mi cuenta necesitaba estar en cero para poder recibir las transferencias y devolver el dinero, por lo que saqué del banco 1.500.000 pesos hacia mi cuenta de MP. Y me hicieron transferirlo en dos pagos de 750 mil pesos a una cuenta que supuestamente era de la tesorera del Banco Galicia”.\nLeé también: Las 6 estafas virtuales más usadas por ciberdelincuentes para robar datos y vaciar cuentas bancarias\nEl pretexto que le dieron era comprobar que la cuenta tuviese margen de movimiento y que no hubiese ningún límite de transferencia diaria. “Ahí me aseguran que mi cuenta cumplía los requisitos y me hicieron programar otra transferencia de 1.300.000 pesos a otro CBU, también de una persona del banco”, agregó García.\n“En ese momento me quedé en cero. Me dijeron que no me preocupara porque en dos o tres minutos, el dinero iba a estar de nuevo en mis cuentas. Y en esos minutos se me vino el mundo encima. Ahí caí que había sido víctima de una estafa y que no habría devolución alguna del dinero”, concluyó Luciano.\n“Siento una gran angustia. Uno cree que nunca le va a pasar... hasta que le pasa. Les di los ahorros de toda mi vida y nunca me di cuenta”, publicó el periodista en X/Twitter luego de lo ocurrido. Y finalizó con un mensaje: “Tengan mucho cuidado con lo que ponen a la venta, a quien le hablan. Realmente tengan cuidado. Ahora a seguir con lo cotidiano y ver cómo va avanzando todo. Me voy a reponer y en unos meses será solo una anécdota”.\nLeé también: Recomendaciones para enseñarles prácticas de ciberseguridad a los más chicos\nCómo hacer la denuncia en caso de ser víctima de una estafa virtual o un ciberdelito Tenés diferentes alternativas en todo el país.
