    "title": "Jim Jordan Throws Trump Lifeline by Reviving 2020 Debate Conspiracy",
    "text": "Jim Jordan Throws Trump Lifeline by Reviving 2020 Debate Conspiracy\nRepublicans are trying everything to help Donald Trump ahead of his debate with Biden, now including one of their oldest CIA conspiracy theories.\nHours before the first Biden-Trump presidential debate on Thursday, House Republicans tried reviving an old 2020 debate conspiracy theory in hopes of helping out Donald Trump.\nThe theory, elevated by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, is based on a statement published in October 2020, signed by 51 former intelligence community leaders casting concern over the release of emails purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. Republicans claimed the statement was a “coordinated hit against President Trump.”\nThe House Judiciary GOP also\nclaimed the “51 former intel officials coordinated with the Biden campaign to publish a statement to discredit @NYPost reporting about Hunter Biden’s laptop and the Biden family’s influence peddling.” That alleged “influence peddling” stems from yet another conservative conspiracy concocted by an FBI informant with ties to Russian intelligence who was charged with lying to Congress for claiming Hunter and Joe Biden were paid $5 million apiece to place Hunter Biden on the board of a Ukrainian energy company to protect the company from investigation.\nThe\nletter at the base of the conspiracy theory was published on October 19, 2020—and it didn’t confirm or deny the authenticity of the Hunter Biden emails. It only noted that the distribution of them appeared “deeply suspicious” and contained “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” To that end, the letter stated:\nWe want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement—just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case. If we are right, this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.\nBut since its release, Republicans have insisted the letter was crafted by the CIA at the behest of Biden—pointing to the fact that he brought up the statement in one of the 2020 presidential debates against Trump. (At the time, most experts agreed that Trump lost both presidential debates handily.)\nIn reality, the statement was written by officials acting in their individual capacity (which is why they all signed it under their names!). Yet some of those who signed had active contracts with the CIA, a point of\ndisdain in the intelligence community as it poses a conflict of interest and throws the CIA into the political muck. That’s really only a boon for conservatives, who have enjoyed years of insisting Trump was cheated out of a second term by the CIA and FBI.\nRepublicans have tried to add a new twist to the old conspiracy theory by pointing to a\nrecounting from former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell, who in April 2023 testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Morrell detailed receiving a call from Anthony Blinken, who at the time was an adviser on Biden’s campaign, about the New York Post story on Hunter Biden’s emails.\n“[Blinken] asked me if I thought that the Russians may have been involved in any way in the emergence of these emails,” Morell said in his testimony, noting that he hadn’t seen the New York Post story prior to Blinken’s call about it. Asked what the intent of the letter was, Morell responded, “One intent was to share our concern with the American people that the Russians were playing on this issue. And, two, it was to help Vice President Biden.” Asked why he wanted to help Biden, Morell responded, “Because I wanted him to win the election.”\nConservatives have incessantly confused the Hunter Biden situation, claiming—as with the Fox News segment\ncited in the video published by the House Judiciary GOP account—that the concern expressed by the 51 signatories about Russian interference in the distribution of Biden’s emails was not about the distribution. Instead, conservatives argue, the intelligence community, Biden campaign, and Democrats all colluded to claim Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake in its entirety. That’s simply not what the letter says.\nAs Raw Story’s Daniel Hampton\nnotes, the timing of the released testimony is suspicious, seemingly intended to give Trump a reheated talking point to throw at Biden during Thursday’s debate. It also appears to be its own attempt at election meddling, a way for Republicans to get back at the “spies who lied” for releasing their letter that was issued three days before the last presidential debate of 2020. In any case, meddling sure is a funny way to condemn meddling. Join The New Republic’s live debate watch party at 9 p.m. E.T. here to see if it comes up.",

    "text": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on Thursday added traditional Li textile techniques, the Qiang New Year festival and traditional Chinese wooden arch bridges to its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nThe full names of the three items are \"traditional Li textile techniques: spinning, dyeing, weaving and embroidering,\" \"Qiang New Year festival,\" and \"traditional design and practices for building Chinese wooden arch bridges.\" All three were previously included in 2009 on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.\nWith a history of over 3,000 years, traditional textile of the Li ethnic group epitomizes the country's earliest textile practices and so is seen as a \"living fossil\" in Chinese textile history.\nTraditional Li textile techniques involve four steps: spinning, dyeing, weaving and embroidering. Li women are particularly adept at these techniques, turning cotton, hemp and other fibers into clothing items, including skirts and kerchiefs, as well as other daily necessities. The textiles play a vital role in the ethnic group's social and cultural occasions, especially in weddings. It's a tradition for Li women to design their own traditional wedding dresses.\nThe Qiang New Year Festival is the grandest and most important traditional festival for the Qiang ethnic group, usually falling on the first day of the tenth month of the traditional Chinese calendar.\nCelebrating the harvest, sending blessings and praying for peace are the central themes of Qiang New Year, and the simple yet primitive ceremonial rituals create a uniquely rich cultural atmosphere that reflects the distinctive characteristics of Qiang culture.\nWooden arch bridges are a prominent feature in China's eastern coastal provinces, particularly Fujian and Zhejiang. These traditional bridges, featuring a blend of time-honored designs, traditional tools, and carpentry methods, use key techniques such as \"beam-weaving\" and mortise-tenon joint structure.\nWith the addition of these three items, China now has 44 cultural elements or practices recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.",

That city's population grew more than 17% from 2020 to 2023, to 8,969.\nWeeks arrived in Navasota in 2022, after serving four years as assistant city manager in La Porte.\nNavasota's growth largely was unplanned, he said, spurred by population spilling down the so-called Aggie Highway from College Station, (Texas 6).\n\"Our current utilities and infrastructure had not been addressed,\" he said. \"We've got the original stuff in the ground.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Navasota dug out, the city working with developers and city planners. Weeks found $1.2 million in sustainable cuts to the city budget, which is $52.3 million this year.\n\"When the council there (in Mineral Wells) saw what I had and bring to the table, they really liked that,\" he said.\nMayor Regan Johnson said Weeks checked the boxes highest on the council's list.\n\"Mr. Weeks has the experience, drive, and desire to be in Mineral Wells that made him the choice for this council as he leads the city staff through the implementation of so many projects, plans and visions that are in place,\" the mayor said. \"We anticipate a smooth transition and great things from Mr. Weeks. We look forward to the future! However, I cannot reiterate enough, how integral Mr. Sullivan's dedication and foresight have been to the continued progress of this city.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. A baby was found on a Colorado street Christmas morning.

David Hawes, the city's immediate past economic development director, encountered Weeks in La Porte when the city needed guidance from Hawes' Houston-based consultant firm, Hawes-Hill.\n\"I've had a relationship with David Hawes for at least seven years,\" Weeks said, describing the Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone that Hawes and his staff helped create for the coastal city.\nDuring interviews in Mineral Wells, he met Hawes' successor, Nathan Dyhre, Main Street Manager Brittany Brown, Fire/EMS Chief Ryan Dunn and other city leaders.\nIt's safe to say Hawes put in a good word for Weeks, he was quick to do so when the Weatherford Democrat asked.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I've had the privilege to work with Mr. Weeks for seven years in La Porte and Navasota,\" Hawes said. \"He is a first class individual and a very professional city administrator. Mineral Wells is fortunate to have someone of Mr. Week's caliber to come here and work for the betterment of our community.\"\nWeeks expects taking three to six months to get his feet under him in his new home. His department heads can expect detailed staff meetings with a boss who holds them accountable but lets them do their jobs.\n\"I'm not a micromanager,\" he said. \"I like to be informed and doing things the best way.\"\nAmong its challenges, Mineral Wells has long faced a high poverty rate — 18.2% in 2022 Census data contrasted with 11.5% nationwide that year.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"The key to addressing poverty is tied to good economic development efforts,\" Weeks said. \"Residents need to have good wage paying jobs that can support their families. Therefore, recruiting new businesses and industry to MW will aid in providing jobs to the workforce.\"\nWeeks also has researched his new home in social media posts.\n\"I'm very aware everybody's upset about the water rates,\" he said. \"I don't put a lot of stuff on social media, but I do read a lot of social media.\"\nHe also envisions better communications among his own departments.\n\"I heard also, interestingly, there's not a lot of communication happening,\" he said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Weeks' financial background will help as staff preparations to write the 2025-26 budget get underway early in 2025. Finance Director Jason Breisch left the city for the private sector after this year's budget was approved.\n\"I will be looking for a new finance director,\" he said. \"I've been without a finance director, and it is very difficult to do both tasks at once.\"\nWeeks grew up in Greenville and welcomes the move closer to family. He and his wife, Rhonda, are raising three children in a blended family.\nHis wife is a teacher in the Windham school district, teaching Texas prison inmates for more than two decades with plans to continue after transferring to the Lindsey State Jail in Jacksboro.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Weeks anticipates getting to know Mineral Wells better during his first 100 days on the job.\n\"I'm going to get immersed in the community,\" he said, noting the Mineral Wells ISD Foundation and membership in Rotary.\nHe also plans to meet business owners and the county commissioners in Palo Pinto and Weatherford, since the town he will lead straddles both counties.\n\"The first 100 days are usually all about the relationships and getting those relationships going,\" he said, describing how his grandfather, George Burton, made sure he raked up the grass clippings when he was a young man mowing lawns. (Burton is Weeks' middle name).\n\"He taught a hard lesson to me, and that's how I've operated my whole life, is going that extra mile and meeting people's needs,\" Weeks said.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "Santiago de Chile, 11 jul (EFECOM).- El presidente chileno, Gabriel Boric, celebró este jueves el 53 aniversario de la nacionalización del cobre y dijo que el mineral rojo es \"el sueldo de Chile\" y \"la vía hacia un país más justo, libre y soberano\".\nEn una ceremonia en Chuquicamata, considerada la mina de cobre a rajo abierto más grande del mundo, Boric aseguró que la producción de cobre -del que Chile es el mayor productor del mundo- le ha reportado al Estado más de 160.000 millones de dólares desde 1971.\n\"Ha sido el sueldo de Chile, pilar sobre el cual se han construido muchos de los beneficios sociales y políticas de bienestar con la que hoy cuentan los chilenos y chilenas\", indicó el mandatario en Chuquicamata, ubicada en Calama, a más de 1.200 kilómetros al norte de Santiago.\nDesde inicios del siglo XX, los principales yacimientos de cobre de Chile eran explotados por capitales extranjeros, como Kennecott Copper Company en El Teniente y Anaconda Copper en Chuquicamata.\nA mediados de siglo, empezaron a surgir críticas al poco aporte que estas compañías hacían a la economía nacional.\nEl 11 de julio de 1971, durante el gobierno del socialista Salvador Allende, el Congreso aprobó por unanimidad la ley N°17.450, que traspasó al Estado la propiedad de la gran minería del cobre y creó la estatal Codelco, la mayor cuprífera del mundo.\n\"Nuestro cobre sigue siendo una viga maestra y una vía hacia el futuro, hacia un Chile más justo, libre y soberano\", indicó el gobernante.\nCodelco es una de las decenas de compañías que explotan el mineral rojo en Chile, donde la minería supone casi un 12 % del PIB y se producen cerca de 5,5 millones de toneladas cada año.\n\"¡Codelco no se privatiza! Es más, Codelco no sólo no se privatiza, sino que avanza en nuevas funciones y exploraciones, como lo estamos haciendo con el litio, que también tiene que ser profundamente chileno\", agregó Boric, en referencia a la nueva estrategia que ha impulsado para convertir a la estatal en un actor relevante en la industria del litio.\nChile es el segundo productor mundial de litio, detrás de Australia, pero su producción en la actualidad se concentra solo en el Salar de Atacama y está concesionada a la chilena SQM y la estadounidense Abermale.\nLa propuesta del Ejecutivo cambia este escenario y entrega a Codelco el control mayoritario de Atacama -que explotará con SQM- y Maricunga, otro salar estratégico.

    "text": "SHORT TERM FORECAST updated:Mon Aug 08 / 10:35 AM\nTODAY:\nHot and humid with a couple of showers and a gusty thunderstorm. High: 91\nTONIGHT:\nEvening thunderstorm; clouds breaking, humid. Low: 72\nTOMORROW:\nPartly sunny and humid with a couple of showers and a gusty thunderstorm. High: 87 Low: 70\n FORECAST SUMMARY Thursday was the second day of what should be a three-day stretch of 90 degrees or higher for a good portion of the area, and likely the fourth heat wave of the summer of 2024. Highs were mostly in the mid 90s on Thursday, with the high humidity driving the heat index up around 100 degrees at times in the afternoon and evening. There were a few spotty t-storms that provided some temporary relief from the heat, but many places remained dry and in need of some rain. As luck would have it, our chances for more widespread but still scattered showers and thunderstorms will go up over the next few days, with Friday and Saturday afternoons and evenings bringing a decent chance for showers and gusty storms that can produce some brief heavy downpours. While we should eclipse the 90-degree mark for one more day on Friday and heat advisories continue for the 100° heat indices into Friday as well, more clouds will keep highs a bit less hot, mostly in the mid to upper 80s for the upcoming weekend. While the weekend won't be a washout by any stretch, there will be some scattered showers and storms each afternoon and evening, and plenty of humidity despite the heat backing off just a bit. For next week, a pair of cold fronts will help to lower humidity levels, the first one Sunday night and the second one Tuesday night and Wednesday. Outside of a few mid-week showers and storms ahead of that second front, much of next week looks dry, and not as hot or as humid as where we are right now.\nDETAILED FORECAST\nFRIDAY\nPresuming we hit the 90-degree mark for the third (and final) day on Friday, then we'll officially have our fourth heat wave of the summer of 2024. Expect a mix of clouds and hazy sunshine and a mostly dry first half of the day, but a better chance, as compared to the last few days, of some more widespread scattered showers and storms in the afternoon and evening. Heavy rain would be the primary localized threat from any thunderstorm, but a stronger storm could also contain some gusty winds. The heat index may approach 100 degrees again Friday afternoon, until any storms have a chance to cool you off. Showers and scattered storms continue into the evening before diminishing overnight, but another warm and muggy night in the low to mid 70s should be the rule under partly cloudy skies.\nTHIS WEEKEND\nWhile last weekend was warm, dry, and comfy, the first weekend of August looks equally as warm (mid to upper 80s) but also quite humid and rather unsettled. Neither day looks to be a washout, but there will be scattered showers and storms both Saturday and Sunday, primarily afternoons and evenings, with some heavier downpours possible in any storms. So it won't rain all or even most of the time, but it can rain hard when it does given the high humidity. So any outdoor plans this weekend, like Musikfest for instance, should prepare for inclement weather when those scattered storms inevitably pop up. But it won't rain everywhere equally, so there will be a hit or miss nature to the weekend storm activity. There will be some hazy sun, but more clouds and those rain chances will keep us out of the 90s, with seasonably warm highs around 83-88° likely both weekend afternoons, and overnight lows again around the 70-degree mark.\nEARLY NEXT WEEK\nIf a cold front that comes through Sunday night continues to settle to our south Monday into Tuesday, it should provide lower rain chances, and likely mostly if not entirely dry weather Monday and perhaps Tuesday too. Highs will remain in the mid to upper 80s, close to average for early August, and the humidity may come down ever so slightly as well, but things don't look to be in the comfortable range just yet. The next chance of showers and storms would be with a cold front for the middle of next week, likely Tuesday night or Wednesday, and then another shot of comfort may follow later in the week along with more dry and sunny weather.\nTRACK THE WEATHER:\nLINKS: HOUR BY HOUR | RADAR | TRAFFIC Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",

    "title": "San Benedetto, bassa stagione anche sulla spiaggia: fino al 6 giugno il servizio è ridotto",
    "text": "SAN BENEDETTO - Un periodo di “bassa stagione”, compreso tra il 17 maggio ed il 6 giugno, nel quale i baywatch in spiaggia potranno essere dispiegati in maniera ridotta. Ecco una delle novità emerse dal confronto tra rappresentanti dei concessionari di spiaggia e vertici della Capitaneria di porto sambenedettese, svoltosi ieri mattina presso il comando dell’Autorità marittima. Nel periodo in questione, durante le giornate feriali, basterà un bagnino ogni 300 metri; mentre nei weekend, ne servirà uno ogni 150 metri, come nel clou dell’estate. L’orario di servizio sarà sempre compreso tra le 10 e le 18.\nIl format\nIl format a ranghi ridotti verrà seguito anche per l’ultima parte della stagione balneare 2025, il cui termine è fissato per domenica 21 settembre. I concessionari di spiaggia si preparano per un inizio di stagione diverso dal solito e partono gli appelli all’attenzione: «Per le strutture che non intendono partire con il salvamento a mare già il 17 maggio, non basterà segnalare agli ospiti l’assenza del servizio» puntualizza Sandro Assenti: dirigente di Confesercenti, patron dello stabilimento Bagni Andrea. «La spiaggia degli chalet dove dovessero mancare i bagnini andrà considerata a tutti gli effetti chiusa, con tutte le indicazioni del caso - prosegue l’imprenditore turistico, presente al summit di ieri -. Questo, ovviamente, non ha nulla a che vedere con la ristorazione ed i servizi-bar, che potranno continuare normalmente. Auspico che tutti i colleghi seguano queste indicazioni, per evitare di incappare in sanzioni, anche perché dalla Capitaneria ci hanno avvisato che verranno effettuati controlli». Ora la palla passa alla cooperativa che cura il servizio di salvamento. Al team del presidente Buttafoco il non facile compito di reperire il personale per un lavoro anticipato. Di solito, infatti, il servizio di salvamento scattava solo a inizio giugno. La prossima settimana è in programma una nuova riunione, stavolta in Comune, per fare il punto della situazione. Intanto, il sindaco Antonio Spazzafumo ha firmato un’ordinanza che delimita le aree di balneazione lungo la costa sambenedettese.\nL’ordinanza\nI punti off-limits sono quattro. Partendo da nord: lo specchio d’acqua della cosiddetta Spiaggia dei Funai, dal confine con Grottammare alla vasca di colmata. Su questo tratto, dovrebbe far eccezione la piccola porzione dedicata alla Doggy Beach. Abbiamo poi il divieto di balneazione per l’intero bacino portuale. Niente bagni anche tutt’intorno al Pennello sull’Albula, per un raggio di 30 metri. Su questa infrastruttura grava anche un divieto d’accesso che, sicuramente, darà filo da torcere agli addetti alla vigilanza, considerato che - durante i mesi caldi - molte persone ci vanno a prendere il sole o a tuffarsi. Lì - come avvenne la scorsa estate, dopo il ripetersi di continui incidenti - dovranno essere posizionate delle barriere di gavitelli in acqua. Ultima area interdetta alla balneazione: i 170 metri di mare a Nord della foce del Tronto.",
