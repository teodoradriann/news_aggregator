    "text": "列藍白聯手「國安3大惡法」 民進黨團：與中國犯台裡應外合\n民進黨立院黨團12日召開「民進黨國安補破網 國民黨國安扯後腿」記者會，立委吳思瑤（左）、郭昱晴（右）出席發言。（記者塗建榮攝）\n〔記者陳政宇／台北報導〕中共對台威脅擴大，立法院民進黨團今（12日）指出，國民黨與中共聯手統戰劇本的3個橋段，包括紅媒認知作戰、政治人物赴中唱和以及藍白力推國安3大惡法；其中，這些惡法不僅削弱總統國安權限及台灣民防體系，甚至使戰事內戰化、國際支援困難，與中國犯台裡應外合。\n民進黨團今天召開「民進黨國安補破網，國民黨國安扯後腿」記者會，由黨團幹事長吳思瑤及副書記長郭昱晴出席說明。\n請繼續往下閱讀...\n吳思瑤指出，中國近期密集展開軍事騷擾與認知作戰，台灣必須破解其輿論戰、心理戰與法律戰，而國共聯手統戰劇本的3大橋段，首先是「國共紅媒兩岸協作認知作戰」，例如抹黑民進黨立委沈伯洋的報導已逾200則，這是認知戰的新形態，也觸犯媒體自律紅線。\n吳思瑤說，其次是「政治人物大舉赴中唱和統戰」，例如前總統馬英九即將赴中參與海峽論壇，自甘淪為統戰樣板，卻成為國民黨立委罷免案的「豬隊友」；第三是「藍白聯手力推國安惡法癱瘓國安」，有3大惡法皆已付委審查，儘管藍白目前按下暫停鍵，但在撤案前隨時都可以強渡關山。\n關於國安3大惡法，吳思瑤進一步說明，惡法之首是國民黨立委陳永康提出的「國家安全戰略法草案」，核心目的是架空總統的國安權限，將國安戰略主導權轉移至立法院，恐為中共犯台時裡應外合。第二是陳永康領銜的「兩岸人民關係條例第29條修正草案」，將使金馬海域「內海化」、台海戰事「內戰化」，進而使國際伸援「真空化」，恐讓中國侵門踏戶、長驅直入。\n吳思瑤續指，第三是國民黨立委葉元之所提「民防法修正草案」、以及國民黨立委徐巧芯所提「全民防衛動員準備法修正草案」，這套包裹修法意圖削弱台灣民防體系，破壞防災自救能力，弱化全民防衛韌性。\n吳思瑤強調，這3大惡法皆直指台灣國安核心，旨在削弱台灣的國家安全防禦能量；呼籲所有國人制止這些扯國安後腿作為，唯有透過「大罷免、大成功」，讓這些親中舔共、無視國家主權與台灣安全的立委離開立法院，才能真正守護家園、保衛台灣。",

    "title": "Thunder Bay's mayor addresses his 'misinformed and incorrect' comments on social issues | CBC News",
    "text": "Thunder Bay's mayor has issued a statement addressing what he describes as \"misinformed and incorrect\" statements he provided to media this week.\nIn a story published by The Chronicle-Journal on Wednesday, Ken Boshcoff is quoted as saying Thunder Bay has a Safe Supply designation, \"which means we are attracting hundreds of thousands of people in the summer and hundreds of people over the winter\" to get free drugs.\nBoshcoff also stated he's been pushed past his \"limits of tolerance.\"\nIn a letter sent to media on Thursday morning, Boshcoff addressed the comments.\n\"I know that it is frustrating and challenging for people in our community who run and operate businesses, and residents, to truly understand these complex issues,\" he stated. \"We know, like many, many other municipalities in Canada, that there are people experiencing homelessness, substance use, and mental health issues here.\"\n\"In the article I spoke about Thunder Bay being designated as a 'Safe Supply City'. We in fact do not have any designation for safer supply. Safer supply is a program that is run and operated by NorWest Community Health Centres and funded by Health Canada.\"\n\"There are special exemptions and requirements for a community to offer this program. It does not draw people to the community for \"safe free drugs\". It's a very small program with less than 25 clients, currently at capacity, receiving a prescription for safer supply with the oversight of health care providers.\"\nJuanita Lawson, CEO of NorWest Community Health Centres, said later Thursday the organization had spoken with Boshcoff about his comments, and hoped to present preliminary results of NorWest's safe supply program — which she said is funded until March — to city council.\nOverall, the social issues Thunder Bay is facing are very complex, she said.\nWATCH | Reaction to mayor's comments: Reaction to Thunder Bay mayor's comments on safer supply\n5 hours ago Duration 0:51 Thunder Bay's mayor, Ken Boshcoff made incorrect and inflammatory statements about safer supply programming in Thunder Bay. Juanita Lawson, CEO of NorWest Health Centres and Thunder Bay City Councillor, Brian Hamilton spoke to the media Thursday. \"I think, to be fair, there's a lot of opportunity to have critical conversations about what we need to do different in our community,\" Lawson said. \"I think that we accept that there was some misunderstanding and some frustration.\"\n\"But I do also think these are opportunities to actually have some conversations with our community, with our business owners, around what do we do? This is really hard, and it's really hard for family members who see their loved ones.\"\nLawson said NorWest's safe supply pilot project, which has been running since 2022, has been successful so far.\nProvince spends $2.7M on new mobile crisis response team in Thunder Bay, Ont. 'We've been where they've been': People with lived addiction experience key in aiding Thunder Bay's vulnerable \"For example, we had 22 per cent of our clients go into treatment,\" she said. \"We have clients who are saying that they are more engaged with their family, they feel connected and they feel supported and they feel more humane.\"\n\"And the other thing that they're talking about is they're having less overdoses, they're experiencing less fentanyl utilization. So we're seeing some really fantastic results of individuals who have the support that they need to have a better life.\"\nNorWest Community Health Centres, located on Simpson Street in Thunder Bay, runs a safe supply pilot program. (Marc Doucette/CBC) Lawson said there is still a lot of work to do in the community when it comes to social issues.\n\"I think that the people are concerned. We have a lot of polarization with regards to individuals who have had some significant trauma in their life,\" she said. \"And so I think it just sort of raises for us the need to continue to communicate, to work with community and really ask people to be empathetic.\"\n\"The individuals who are on this program are our citizens, They're from our community. And I think that's really important to remember that they are our people.\"\nMcKellar Coun. Brian Hamilton said he was \"a little bit taken aback\" by Boshcoff's initial comments.\n\"There were some inaccuracies in there that I think the mayor is looking at,\" he said.\nBut, Hamilton said, the city is \"in a bit of a storm.\"\n\"It requires a lot of patience, a lot of compassion and understanding,\" he said. \"We have to work on this together and we're not going to get anywhere without the cooperation of the very people that we're talking about.\"\nThunder Bay hospital launches anti-stigma campaign to better support patients with addictions \"So this has to be a full community effort, including residents of encampments, people living on the street,\" Hamilton said. \"We're all in this together. And this is this is truly one of those moments where it's a community-led response, but it's not us versus them.\"\nHamilton noted good things are happening, including the creation of more than 170 transitional beds in the city.\n\"We weren't talking about transitional, supportive housing only 10 years ago,\" he said. \"Now that is not only a buzzword, but that's the reality.\"\n\"It's important to remember too, that every day of frustration that that people are feeling, that businesses are feeling, — which is real and palpable — work is being done behind the scenes to bring more support, more transitional housing and to work on these hard-won solutions that are ultimately going to lead us into clear waters.\"",

    "title": "Morena perfila votar reforma judicial y desaparición de autónomos en septiembre",
    "text": "Cuatro días después de las elecciones federales que dieron el triunfo a Morena y aliados, legisladores de dichas fuerzas políticas anunciaron que procederán a las reformas del &#039;Plan C&#039;, para concretar la desaparición de algunos órganos autónomos y la profunda reforma judicial, apenas inicie la 66 Legislatura en septiembre. El aún líder de la bancada de Morena en la Cámara de Diputados, y virtual senador por Puebla, Ignacio Mier Velazco, anticipó que las 18 iniciativas de reforma a la Constitución que el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador envió el 5 de febrero serán dictaminadas con rapidez para que se aprueben apenas inicie la nueva Legislatura. ¿Cuál es el estatus del &#039;&#039;Plan C&#039;&#039;? Se procederá, “es un hecho”, anunció, tras diálogo que sostengan con el presidente saliente López Obrador y la virtual mandataria Claudia Sheinbaum. La idea es que el “Plan C” –dijo Mier Velazco- “sea votado una vez que se instale el Congreso General. El proceso legislativo se va a mantener. Habremos de platicar los diputados y senadores electos con la virtual presidenta y con la participación del gobierno saliente para poder determinar y ajustar el dictamen correspondiente. Es un hecho”. En conferencia conjunta de legisladores de Morena, Partido del Trabajo (PT) y Partido Verde (PVEM) en la Comisión Permanente, festejaron el triunfo de Sheinbaum. En abril la Comisión de Puntos Constitucionales de la Cámara preparó ya predictámenes de 18 iniciativas presidenciales que en total modifican 54 artículos de la Constitución, pero aunque se programó dictaminar y votar, se pospusieron las decisiones. Entre los anteproyectos de dictamen están a la iniciativa presidencial de reforma al Poder Judicial, para la elección de jueces, magistrados de tribunales (electorales, en materia civil o administrativa) y la elección en urnas de los ministros de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN). Además está la propuestas de reforma electoral presidencial para cercenar 200 diputaciones federales de representación proporcional y 68 senadurías plurinominales, así como reducir de 11 a 7 el número de consejeros del Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) y la renovación de tajo –sin escalonamiento- de sus integrantes, todos a elegirse por un periodo de seis años. Se incluye la obligación del INE de organizar elecciones de integrantes del Poder Judicial e incluso la auto-elección de consejeros electorales. Además el &#039;&#039;Plan C&#039;&#039; incluye reformas para reducir facultades o incluso desaparecer organismos autónomos como el mismo INE, el Instituto Nacional de Acceso a la Información y Protección de Datos (INAI) y el Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT); la Comisión Federal de Competencia (Cofece), la Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CRE) y la Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos (CNH).",

    "title": "Jerusalem Christian Woman Cancels Christmas as War in Gaza Continues – Al Jazeera",
    "text": "For two and a half months, Jerusalem Christian woman Jida Qamshita has sat in front of her television screen around the clock to follow\nnews of the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, refusing to prepare for this Christmas, even though she has done so every year in the past. Eagerly looking forward to this festival.\nThe Jerusalem woman does not set up or decorate a Christmas tree in her home, even though, according to her, it is considered one of the most joyful customs and rituals of the holiday, and because Christians around the\nworld—especially Palestinian Christians— — are all waiting for the arrival of Christmas Day, and celebrating and participating in prayers in Bethlehem.\nYet as this year’s celebrations faded, so did the preparations, and Kamushta doesn’t remember the courtyard of Bethlehem’s Church of the Nativity being decorated with any Christmas trees and ornaments, nor does she remember the movement of Christian pilgrims from the Holy Land at some point this year. Disappeared.\nKamshita said, “On this year’s anniversary of the birth of Christ, our country is sad and our people are being massacred. How can anyone celebrate it normally? My only wish is for peace and that we can be free. To live in a safe place like everyone else in the\nworld, our children can have peace of mind and safety.”\nJida Qamshita, a Christian woman in Jerusalem, sat in front of the\nTV screen to follow the news of the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Against the backdrop of the massacre carried out by the occupying forces, she could not feel any joy about Christmas (Al Jazeera)\nThe celebration has been cancelled.\nLike Kamshtar, other Christians in Jerusalem, especially those in the Old City, could not wake up on the morning of December 24 this year to the sound of the Boy Scout parade – which is usually organized on this day each year. activities, the Patriarch will also leave the Latin Patriarchate in the Old City of Jerusalem and celebrate Christmas Mass in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.\nOn the occasion of Christmas, the Boy Scouts of Jerusalem usually hold two main parades. The first is organized when the Christmas tree is lighted in the Old City, especially near the “New Gate”, and the second is held every December. Organized on the morning of the 24th.\nElias Habash, the leader of the Arab Catholic Scouts group, told Al Jazeera that for the first time in years, the 250-strong group of children and adults had received no training on Christmas celebrations.\nHabash added, “At this time in previous years, we were all at the peak of the pressure and we were training long hours every day, but this year, all of that has disappeared, but it’s nothing compared to the damage that the country is going through. .This injury completely changes everything.”\nHe also emphasized that the Arab Catholic Scouts, headquartered in the Old City of Jerusalem, continues to carry out scouting and volunteer activities, but has suspended all parades and\nentertainment activities since October 7 this year.\nThe Old City of Jerusalem will not hold the same lively Christmas celebrations as in previous years (Al Jazeera)\nIs the war buried?\nNot only have the sounds of Boy Scout drills in Jerusalem faded away, but the Christmas songs that used to ring from the balconies of Christian homes at this time have also disappeared and are limited to one hymn: “On Christmas Eve, hatred is wiped out. On Christmas Eve, war is buried .Christmas Eve, love grows.”\nBut the war was not yet buried, and its noise had been drowning out all other sounds for weeks. As a result, Bishop Suhail Dawani, former bishop of the Arab Evangelical Episcopal Church in Jerusalem, said this year’s holiday will be used only for limited religious observances.\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Dawani emphasized that this year he will pray for all those who are suffering and those who face murder and violence, adding that the message of Christmas has always been a message of love and peace, and the prayers of believers in the church On the lips will be spoken messages of love and peace, and hymns sung to this end.\nYusuf Daher, coordinator of the\nWorld Council of Churches’ office in Jerusalem, told Al Jazeera that there are about 9,000 Christians in Jerusalem, half of whom live in the Old City, and they are not satisfied with the arrival of Christmas this year. Because the whole country is enveloped in an atmosphere of sadness.\nDaher said that just as they are not celebrating the holiday, no tourists are coming to Bethlehem and Jerusalem this year to enjoy the festive atmosphere or to enjoy the divinity that dominates the holiday’s midnight masses.\nDaher: Nearly 9,000 Christians in Jerusalem do not feel the joy of Christmas (Al Jazeera)\nbethlehem\nBethlehem is often seen as a destination for Palestinian Christians at this time of year – they go there before, during and after Christmas – but this year, like every other West Bank city since the war began, except All but one of Bethlehem’s other entrances have been closed, and Palestinians spend a long time trying to get through this one remaining entrance.\nThe Justice and Peace Commission of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land released this year’s Christmas message, in which it stated: “We – Christians – express our solidarity with all those who have suffered in war, and Christmas remains a time of prayer and reflection for those who suffer A holiday with deep meaning.”\nThe committee added, “This year we walk to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem to pray and ask for the joy God has promised us. We are people of hope. We place our hope in God. We are sure that we will never be alone, and we know God has chosen our land and will dispel our darkness.”\nThe Christmas message concluded, “We ask all those who celebrate Christmas around the\nworld to join us in praying for peace in Bethlehem, Gaza and throughout the Holy Land. Together we pray for an end to the violence, the liberation of all prisoners and a permanent ceasefire .”\nIn about two weeks, this year’s Christmas will come to an end, and Christians are wondering whether it will also end the ongoing war in Gaza and the abuses perpetrated by settlers against Christians in Jerusalem.\n#Jerusalem #presence #pain #absence #Christmas #joy #Gaza\n2023-12-23 10:15:07",

    "text": "J&KIMD forecasts isolated fog in JK; Dense fog leads to significant disruptions in air, train traffic By KNS Posted on Dec 29, 2023 | Updated on Dec 29, 2023 Share Tweet Share Ishtiyaq Ahmad Srinagar, Dec 29 (KNS): The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a weather forecast indicating the likelihood of fog at isolated places over Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days. The advisory comes as part of the routine weather updates provided by the IMD to keep citizens and authorities informed on potential weather-related disruptions. According to the latest forecast, certain areas in Jammu and Kashmir are expected to experience foggy conditions, impacting visibility and posing potential challenges for commuters and travelers. News agency KNS reported that the IMD has urged residents, as well as those planning to travel through the region, to exercise caution and stay updated on the evolving weather conditions. Fog can significantly affect transportation, including road and air travel, as reduced visibility may lead to delays and disruptions. The IMD has advised travelers to check for real-time updates from official weather sources, follow traffic advisories, and take necessary precautions while navigating through fog-prone areas. The meteorological department uses advanced technology and data analysis to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts, enabling individuals and authorities to prepare for adverse conditions. In light of the fog alert for Jammu and Kashmir, local authorities are expected to take necessary measures to mitigate potential challenges and ensure the safety of the public. The IMD regularly monitors and analyzes atmospheric conditions to provide forecasts and warnings for various weather phenomena, including fog, rain, and snow. The information is crucial for planning and decision-making, especially in regions prone to specific weather patterns. As residents and travelers in Jammu and Kashmir brace for possible foggy conditions, it is recommended to stay tuned to official weather updates and follow safety guidelines issued by local authorities. The IMD's efforts in providing accurate and timely forecasts contribute to enhancing preparedness and reducing the impact of adverse weather events on the community. Meanwhile dense fog wreaked havoc on air, train, and vehicular traffic in the northern region today, leading to the cancellation of six flights at Jammu airport. Train schedules were severely impacted, with Malwa Express arriving 12 hours late, Humsafar Express delayed by 13 hours, and Madras Express facing an 11-hour delay at Jammu Railway Station. Jammu experienced a significant drop in temperature; registering 5 degrees Celsius lower than the previous day. Drivers coped with the challenging conditions by using dippers and fog lamps, while some parked their vehicles on the roadside, awaiting improved visibility. A slight improvement in weather conditions was observed only after 11 am. The Meteorological Department reported that Jammu is expected to witness dry weather with dense fog for the next four days. Additionally, there is a forecast for light rain and snow in certain areas of Jammu and Kashmir on January 3-4. Dense fog significantly impacted air traffic in Jammu, resulting in the cancellation of six out of 15 scheduled flights, with one flight being diverted. Of the flights that did land, most were delayed and rescheduled. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Northern Railway reported delays of 2 to 13 hours for many trains arriving at Jammu Station today.

    "title": "Leah Remini Announces Divorce From Husband Angelo Pagan After 21 Years of Marriage: ‘We Both Changed’",
    "text": "Leah Remini announced she’s splitting from husband Angelo Pagán .\nThe King of Queens actress, 54, took to Instagram to say the couple mutually “decided to file for divorce” after 21 years of marriage.\n“This decision came after a lot of thought and care,” the Brooklyn native confirmed solemnly. “We are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us.”\nShe filed the divorce documents on the night of Thursday, August 29, and cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split, according to documents viewed by TMZ . In addition to filing the paperwork without a lawyer, Leah listed their date of separation as August 1 and asked that neither of them be awarded spousal support.\nLeah tied the knot with Angelo, 56, in July 2003 after they first started dating in 1996. The couple share one daughter, Sofia , 20. On ​Thursday, August 30, the actress told fans they had decided to bring their 28-year relationship to an end.\nThe consummate performer gave her reasoning: “We both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore.”\n“We are proud of how we have worked through this together.”\nThe divorce comes on the heels of a rocky few years for the embattled star, who has been speaking out publicly against the Church of Scientology , of which Leah is a former member.\nSince leaving the church in 2013, Leah has told fans on X her life has become a “constant struggle” and that she is regularly “consumed by fear,” anxiety and depression.\nCelebrity Crossword 29 Crosswords\nPlay now In court documents obtained by In Touch in August 2023, Leah alleged that she has been “stalked, surveilled, harassed, threatened [and] intimidated” for the last 10 years and that she has been the targeted victim of “intentional malicious and fraudulent rumors” via social media accounts associated with the church.\nInTouch Asks Tom Cruise 15 Burning Questions: Suri, Religion and More The actress further alleged that the leaders of Scientology created a “ campaign to ruin and destroy [her] life and livelihood,” while also targeting her loved one.\nLeah laid bare the drama surrounding her exodus from the church in a memoir published in 2015, Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology , and her docuseries, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath , which ran for three season starting in 2016, and heavily featured Angelo’s perspective on the ordeal.\n“We want to be as transparent as we can be here because, for years, we shared our marriage so publicly,” the actress stated in her divorce announcement.\nHowever, in a change of pace from the turmoil over the last 11 years, the star says her marriage “was a huge success” despite the impending break up.\n“And now, we’re looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way,” she said.\n“Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal – together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones.”\n“Our bond is still strong – it’s just evolved into something different.”\n“We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate,” Leah continued.\nLike much of her life post-Scientology, the Leah Remini: It’s All Relative star will be airing her divorce for all to see and learn from, the actress hopes.\nDeal of the Day Get This Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner for 90% Off!

Inside Scientologist Wife's Disappearance “We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year.”\n“We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships – whether they change or end – aren’t failures,” Leah added.\n“We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter.”",
