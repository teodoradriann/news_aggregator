    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Pesquisadores da Universidade Edith Cowan, na Austrália, em colaboração com a Universidade de Saúde e Bem-Estar Niigata, no Japão, realizaram um estudo inovador sobre os efeitos de exercícios de curta duração na Força Muscular. O foco do estudo foi entender como contrações breves, mas regulares, podem impactar a força do bíceps. A pesquisa envolveu jovens voluntários saudáveis que realizaram contrações de três segundos do bíceps ao longo de quatro semanas.\nOs resultados foram surpreendentes: aqueles que se exercitaram três vezes por semana apresentaram um aumento significativo na Força Muscular. Em contraste, os participantes que realizaram o exercício apenas duas vezes por semana não mostraram mudanças notáveis. Essa descoberta sugere que a frequência dos exercícios pode ser mais importante do que a duração em si.\nComo três segundos de exercício podem fazer diferença?\nA pesquisa revelou que, em média, houve um aumento de 2,5% na capacidade de levantamento de peso e 3,9% na força ao abaixar o peso. O professor Kazunori Nosaka, líder do estudo, destacou que exercícios curtos e regulares são mais eficazes do que sessões longas e esporádicas. Segundo Nosaka, as adaptações musculares ocorrem principalmente durante o período de descanso, tornando os intervalos entre os exercícios cruciais para o desenvolvimento da força e da massa muscular.\nO estudo enfatiza que, embora o exercício em si dure apenas três segundos, o tempo de descanso entre as sessões é essencial. Nosaka menciona que o descanso no estudo foi cerca de 28.800 vezes maior que o tempo de exercício, sublinhando a importância do repouso na recuperação e fortalecimento muscular.\nQual é o impacto dos exercícios curtos na vida diária?\nPara muitas pessoas, encontrar tempo para exercícios longos e intensos pode ser um desafio. No entanto, este estudo sugere que mesmo exercícios breves, quando realizados regularmente, podem trazer benefícios significativos. Nosaka aponta que, para algumas pessoas, dedicar 20 minutos diários ao exercício pode ser inviável, mas apenas cinco minutos podem fazer uma diferença perceptível na saúde muscular.\nEmbora os resultados sejam promissores, Nosaka ressalta a necessidade de mais pesquisas para validar completamente suas descobertas. Ele destaca a importância de entender que mesmo pequenas quantidades de exercício, se realizadas consistentemente, podem impactar positivamente o corpo humano.\nQuais são as implicações futuras para a prática de exercícios?\nAs descobertas deste estudo podem revolucionar a forma como as pessoas abordam o exercício físico. Com a crescente demanda por soluções de saúde eficientes e de fácil implementação, a ideia de que breves períodos de exercício podem ser tão eficazes quanto sessões mais longas é atraente. Isso pode incentivar mais pessoas a incorporar exercícios em suas rotinas diárias, mesmo com agendas apertadas.\nAlém disso, a pesquisa abre caminho para novos estudos sobre a otimização de exercícios para diferentes grupos populacionais, incluindo idosos e pessoas com mobilidade reduzida. A possibilidade de melhorar a saúde muscular com um investimento mínimo de tempo pode ter um impacto significativo na saúde pública.\nEm suma, a pesquisa conduzida pelas universidades Edith Cowan e Niigata oferece uma nova perspectiva sobre a prática de exercícios, destacando a importância da regularidade e do descanso na construção da Força Muscular. À medida que mais estudos são realizados, a compreensão sobre os benefícios dos exercícios de curta duração continuará a evoluir, potencialmente transformando práticas de saúde e bem-estar em todo o mundo.",

    "title": "More Americans Rode a Bike Than Ever Before in 2024, Youth Participation Saw the Biggest Surge",
    "text": "PeopleForBikes released its 2024 U.S. Bicycling Participation Study, offering new insights into bicycling trends across the country. This biennial report reveals that 112 million Americans — 35% of those ages 3 and older — rode a bike at least once in 2024. This marks the highest participation rate since the study began in 2014, underscoring an increasing interest in bicycling propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn even better news, youth participation (ages 3 to 17) in bicycling increased from 49% to 56% since the last study, reversing a steady decline in youth ridership since 2018. As the bike industry continues to navigate sales turbulence and economic headwinds, this data provides key information to guide industry investments, advocacy efforts, and infrastructure development.\n“The significant increase in youth participation signals a potential new generation of lifelong riders, but with 53% of riders worried about being hit by a car, we must take action to ensure people today and tomorrow feel safe and comfortable riding a bike,” said Jenn Dice, president and CEO of PeopleForBikes. “This underscores the urgent need for continued investment in safe places to ride and highlights the critical importance of connecting bicycle networks both on and off-road to ensure safer, more accessible riding experiences for all.”\nOther notable findings from the PeopleForBikes study:\n-\n50% of riders said they are familiar with the bike lanes, paths, and trails in their area.\n-\nRidership increased by 9% for youth ages 3 to 9 and 15% for youth ages 10 to 17.\n-\nTraveling to/from social or recreation activities became the number one reason for transportation riding, bumping errands/shopping.\nIn addition to these insights, the report provides detailed breakdowns of how frequently Americans are riding, regional participation trends, and indoor-versus-outdoor riding, among other findings. It also examines consumer motivations and behaviors behind why they ride, how they feel when they ride, and even examines how likely non-riders are to get on a bicycle in the future.\nAs with past reports, the 2024 data was generated through survey results from 16,000 adults nationwide. The study used the same methodology as previous participation studies, allowing PeopleForBikes to tap into 10 years of historical data to track how bicycling participation and perceptions have evolved over time.\nThe full report can be accessed for free by PeopleForBikes Coalition members in the PeopleForBikes Member Center. The study is available for purchase by non-members in the PeopleForBikes Resource Marketplace.\nAbout PeopleForBikes\nPeopleForBikes is a national bike foundation and the U.S. bicycle industry’s trade association representing more than 340 bicycle industry supplier members and nearly 1.4 million individuals. Through our three areas of influence — infrastructure, policy, and participation — we accelerate the construction of safe, fun, and connected places to bike; advance pro-bike and pro-bike-business legislation; and welcome more people to the joys of riding a bike.

    "text": "The incident occurred at 01.30 am on the Akkikavu bypass, bus driver critically injured\nThrissur: Fourteen people were injured when a KSRTC bus and a lorry carrying fish collided in Pannithadam junction on the Akkikavu bypass in Thrissur on Thursday morning. The bus driver’s injuries are critical, according to media reports.\nThe accident occurred in the wee hours of the day, at 01.30 am. The KSRTC bus was travelling from Calicut to Kumily, Idukki, when the collision occurred. The lorry had loaded fish from Kunnamkulam and was headed to Alathur.\nFollowing the accident, the two vehicles rammed into a nearby shop. The front side of both vehicles were completely destroyed in the process. The injured have been admitted to a private hospital in Kunnamkulam.\nAccidents have become a regular occurrence after the bypass was renovated. A similar incident took place recently when a fish lorry collided with another lorry. Temporary arrangements have been erected on the bypass to enable motorists to control speed while driving and prevent accidents. However, lack of such safety measures on the Wadakkanchery-Chavakkad State Highway poses problems at present.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "title": "Michael Keaton Has Harsh Words for Donald Trump & Elon Musk",
    "text": "Batman has spoken! Michael Keaton is no stranger to speaking his mind, something he usually does in a stern, yet intelligent, way. With the Presidential election almost upon us, Keaton has a message to male voters about Republican nominee Donald Trump and Elon Musk, an unlikely pair united in their goal to put the convicted former president in the White House again. Despite some males seemingly believing that the duo respects them, their well-being, and their opinions, Keaton wants to make it clear that this is not the case. Keaton took to his Instagram page to post a video where he declared that both Trump and Musk \"don't really respect you,\" speaking specifically to male voters who are still considering voting for Trump. The actor was pretty pointed in his comments but spoke some serious truths about the pair if you fall on Keaton's side. The actor continued: \"Some of you folks, guys mostly, who are thinking about attending a rally with Musk and Trump — they don’t really respect you. They laugh at you behind your back. They think you’re stupid. They don’t want to hang out with you. They have nothing in common with you. They’re not your bros.” Keaton is speaking on how Trump particularly wants to sell that he's for the people and will be in support of all Americans should he be elected president again. The actor has thrown his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris for her Presidential bid, even campaigning for Harris in his native Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which will be a key swing state in determining the election. It's clear that Keaton believes Trump and his supporters will say whatever they need to say to get elected but, in the long run, they couldn't care less about the little man and only care about themselves. The Batman actor also believes Trump is aware of his pull with his supporters, pointing to the former President saying he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still vote for him. Keaton elaborated on that by saying, \"Basically, what he’s saying in parentheses is people are so stupid. They’re so dumb, they’d still vote for me. They have no respect for you, trust me.\" Michael Keaton Isn't the Only Actor to Call Out Donald Trump Keaton isn't the only person who has called out Trump and the male voters who believe he's a \"bro\" or some alpha male. Dave Bautista recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in a taped segment that called out this very notion , insinuating that Trump isn't a man at all and that his male supporters need to be aware of that. Bautista is an actor that has also put his support behind Harris and hasn't been shy about letting that be known. [Related ](/donald-trump-bashes-the-apprentice/) [ Donald Trump Finally Breaks His Silence About The Apprentice ](/donald-trump-bashes-the-apprentice/) The convicted former President unsurprisingly bashes the controversial biopic. Sebastian Stan, who plays Trump in the latest film The Apprentice, has called out the former President for different reasons, particularly his hypocrisy . Stan was asked if the film would serve a purpose in swaying voters away from Trump, and he asked voters to \"dig deeper\" before they think about whomever they may vote for. The actor said, \"I don't know. But what I do hope is that people regardless of their opinion, are curious enough to try to dig deeper. Because I think we're living in a world where it's so easy to be handed an opinion everywhere you turn.\" He then went on to voice his opinion on Trump trying to censor his movie. \"He's been trying to censor this movie, and at the same time, he claims that he acknowledges free speech...I can't think of anything more hypocritical. So at the end of the day, it's about him as a character. Forget the politics and just go in there and use your instinct and ask yourself: Do you trust this man?\"",

    "text": "22/03/2024 - 7:02\nA prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro decretou ponto facultativo nesta sexta-feira (22) devido à previsão de fortes chuvas até a tarde de sábado (23) na cidade. A medida, publicada em edição especial do Diário Oficial do Município na noite de ontem (21), contempla servidores de áreas administrativas não essenciais e escolas municipais. O objetivo é reduzir a circulação de pessoas na capital fluminense.\nA previsão, segundo a prefeitura, é de pancadas de chuva moderada a muito forte, acompanhada de raios e rajadas de ventos de até 75,9 quilômetros por hora (km/h). Estima-se precipitação que pode chegar a 200 milímetros em 24 horas. Isso significa que existe a possibilidade de chover 200 litros por metro quadrado. A média de março é de 124,7 mm durante o mês.\nNotícias relacionadas:\nEstado de São Paulo pode ter chuva forte de quinta-feira até sábado. Sul e Sudeste têm alerta para chuva forte entre quinta e domingo.\nO prefeito Eduardo Paes também orienta que escolas particulares e outras empresas privadas suspendam serviços não essenciais hoje. “É ideal termos a cidade esvaziada”, afirmou Paes, em nota à imprensa. “É provável que a chuva comece ao longo da tarde. E, nesse momento, seria importante termos pouco movimento na cidade”.\nO governo do estado já tinha anunciado\nponto facultativo em suas repartições e orientado as prefeituras fluminenses a adotar a mesma medida.\nAlgumas escolas particulares da cidade enviaram comunicados às famílias de estudantes informando que vão se manter abertas, mas que não haverá prejuízo pedagógico caso os alunos decidam se ausentar.\nInstituições públicas de ensino superior, como a Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), a Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio (UniRio) e o Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica (Cefet/RJ) suspenderam aulas presenciais. A Universidade do Estado do Rio (Uerj) decretou ponto facultativo.\nAlém do ponto facultativo, a prefeitura se mantém em estágio 2 (em uma escala de 1 a 5, em ordem crescente de gravidade), com mais de 9 mil servidores atuando na cidade, com equipes da Comlurb, das secretarias de Conservação e de Ordem Pública, do Centro de Operações Rio, da Rio Águas, da Defesa Civil, do Sistema Alerta Rio, da Fundação Georio, da Guarda Municipal e da CET-Rio.",
