    "title": "IG Metall: Nationwide warning strikes at VW on Monday - MarketScreener",
    "text": "WOLFSBURG (dpa-AFX) - IG Metall is calling for widespread warning strikes at Volkswagen this Monday. \"Warning strikes will begin at all plants on Monday,\" announced Thorsten Groger, head of the IG Metall district in Lower Saxony. He did not initially give any details.\nThe peace obligation, during which strikes are not permitted, expired at midnight. IG Metall has already announced that it will call for temporary work stoppages at all sites from the beginning of December, but has not yet given any specific dates.\nThe dispute concerns the pay of the 120,000 or so employees at Volkswagen AG plants, where a separate company wage agreement applies. VW has so far rejected any increase and is instead demanding a ten percent pay cut due to the Group's difficult situation. Plant closures and compulsory redundancies are also on the table. Both sides will meet for their next round of collective bargaining on December 9.\nThe last time there were warning strikes at individual sites at VW was in the 2021 in-house collective bargaining round. The last time there was widespread action at all six major plants in western Germany was in 2018. According to IG Metall, more than 50,000 employees took part at that time./fjo/DP/mis\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack © dpa-AFX - 2024",

    "title": "Typhoon Kong-rey disrupts trains in eastern Taiwan - Focus Taiwan",
    "text": "Typhoon Kong-rey has partly paralyzed rail services in eastern Taiwan, with the Eastern Main Line expected to resume normal operations later on Friday and the North Link Line on Saturday morning, the Taiwan Railway Corp. (TR) said. All North Link Line services between Su'aoxin Station in northeastern Taiwan and Hualien Station remain suspended as track repair efforts continue. The TR has rerouted southbound express trains from Taipei and they are now terminating at Su'ao or Luodong. All services between Hualien and Taitung were suspended until 1 p.m. Friday. Local express trains from Taipei to Hualien will operate only as far as Horen or Heping stations, while northbound trains from Hualien to Yilan began terminating at Xincheng Station at 10 a.m. To help accommodate passengers, the TR has arranged temporary bus services between Hualien and Ruisui stations and is adjusting bus frequency based on demand. According to the TR, repair work is challenging due to landslides burying sections of the track between Horen and Chongde. Crews are working to clear these sections in time for Saturday's first scheduled train. Power infrastructure damage has also contributed to the disruption. Repairs on the North Link Line's power equipment between Jingmei and Beipu stations are expected to be completed by Friday afternoon, while power on the Eastern Main Line between Fuyuan and Guangfu stations is expected to be restored by that evening. Meanwhile, Western Main Line trains in both directions were operating on a single track between Xizhi and Nangang due to damaged electricity lines near Xike Station in New Taipei City. This service was expected to return to normal around noon. Meanwhile, the Pingxi, Shen'ao, Neiwan and Jiji branch lines were expected to gradually resume service at noon. Passengers holding unused tickets purchased during the typhoon warning period can obtain refunds without service fees within one year of their original travel date. - Society 2 dead, 515 injured, 4 missing in wake of Typhoon Kong-rey 11/01/2024 03:37 PM - Business Forex settlement ceiling raised as Taiwan aims to be wealth management hub 11/01/2024 03:17 PM - Society Warnings for Tropical Storm Kong-rey lifted 11/01/2024 02:39 PM - Business Taiwan shares close down 0.18% 11/01/2024 01:56 PM - Society Typhoon Kong-rey disrupts trains in eastern Taiwan 11/01/2024 01:51 PM [More](/news)",
