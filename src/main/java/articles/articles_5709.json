    "text": "PASTOR Vinworth Dayal, who walked into the Central Bank in December 2019 and tried to exchange more than $28 million in $100 cotton bills for polymer notes, has been committed to stand trial for money laundering. On Wednesday Chief Magistrate Maria Busby Earle-Caddle found that the State had presented sufficient evidence to have Dayal, head of the Third Exodus Assembly Church in Longdenville, face trial at the High Court. Dayal, who lives in La Romaine, was granted bail of $10 million after the committal warrant was read to him. He was accused of being in possession of criminal property in the amount of $28,028,600 on December 31, 2019. The State contended that the money represented a pecuniary advantage to Dayal as a result of criminal conduct contrary to the Income Tax Act, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that those proceeds were criminal property. A second charge was laid against Dayal after police officers allegedly found an additional $2,691,338, at his home on January 2, 2020. Dayal was represented by senior counsel Pamela Elder and Richard Mason, while the State was represented by Wayne Rajbansie and Candace Jacob. In all, 26 witnesses testified at the preliminary enquiry either in person or with their statements tendered into evidence. Following the completion of the State’s evidence, Elder made a no-case submission, arguing that the State had failed to have a prima facie case made out. The magistrate, however, dismissed the submission. Both charges were laid under Section 45(1)(b) of the Proceeds of Crime Act and were laid 18 months after Dayal tried to exchange the money, which has since been held in an interest-bearing account. December 31, 2019, was the last day on which the Central Bank said it would accept cotton $100 bills to exchange for new polymer bills. On the deadline date, Dayal went to the Central Bank with 28 cardboard boxes, each containing approximately $1 million. Police were called in after he could not provide proper documentation for how he obtained the money. He said it came from tithes which he had collected over the years.",

Washington DC [US], March 10 : As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started \"preparing rigorously\" for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials. The report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis. The Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said. Amid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN. \"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official said. US officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis. \"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying. \"I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the senior administration official added. \"I can't demonstrate this positively, but I think that's our assessment.\" Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India. During this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place \"in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,\" the senior administration official said. Notably, late summer 2022 was also proving a 'devastating period' for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia's biggest prize since the invasion. As these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a \"potential trigger\" for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN. Also, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack. In October 2022, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was \"concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.\" But, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported. \"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said. \"And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would've expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.\" Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor [Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/international/pm-modis-outreach-to-putin-helped-prevent-potential-nuclear-attack-on-ukraine-in-late-2022-cnn-report/)",

    "text": "Happy Colorado Sunday, friends.\nThis has been a particularly blissful autumn (and I know, I just jinxed us all by saying it), the temperate days a lovely invitation to take a walk around and just observe.\nI’ve been a bit obsessed by the scraggly apple trees along my walking routes, wondering what magic has allowed them to survive and thrive, and this year in particular, put out staggering amounts of fruit. These are old trees, not some twee varieties grafted up to appeal to the eyes of supermarket shoppers or factory orchards that value refrigerator hardiness over flavor. I often wonder where they came from, and I’m excited to occasionally see trees in my neighborhood that have been inventoried and tagged by the Boulder Apple Tree Project , which hopes to better understand the genetics of the most resilient trees in our county.\nIt’s that kind of work that led to the rescue of the Colorado Orange apple. In this week’s cover story Sue McMillin explains how a single tree in Fremont County has led to a kind of orchard renaissance for a variety of fruit that was economically important back in the day.\nDana Coffield\nEditor\nThe Cover Story Secrets of the Colorado Orange apple starting to be revealed Apple trees draped in fruit tree worm netting at Ela Family Farms near Hotchkiss. (William Woody, Special to The Colorado Sun) When I read The Sun’s story five years ago about the Colorado Orange apple, I was intrigued because I live in Fremont County, where that heritage apple originated and where that last tree was discovered. The precise location of the tree was a deeply held secret until the tree died and nobody had to worry about people searching for it. Turns out it was only a few miles from my house.\nBut now there are new Colorado Orange apple trees popping up in Fremont County and around the state, and this year the first known harvest of a few apples is taking place.\nIt was a joy to talk to the people who made that happen because they are passionate about what they do. Jude Schuenemeyer, whose grafts led to the trees being on the market, and Steve Ela, who was beginning to taste test the first couple dozen apples appearing at his Hotchkiss orchard, were more than willing to talk about the Colorado Orange and the revival of heritage apples.\nIt might not turn out to be the tastiest eating apple — or maybe it will, the verdict isn’t in. But it sure was fun to write about its rebirth.\nREAD THIS WEEK’S COLORADO SUNDAY FEATURE\nSue McMillin | Writer\nThe Colorado Lens People make the place and our visual journalists encountered some highly compelling characters in their travels last week.\nA supporter of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, wearing a Trump costume, waits for a rally to begin Friday at Gaylord Rockies hotel in Aurora.

(Danika Worthington, The Colorado Sun) Colorado knows The Wolf’s Tailor is good — that’s why you’d be wise to get a reservation in advance. The Michelin Guide knows it’s good — that’s why they awarded it one star and a green star for sustainability. James Beard knows it’s good — that’s why Kelly and Erika Whitaker won the Outstanding Restaurateur Award in 2024 for the eateries under their umbrella.\nSurely it’s time for more everyday foodies to start catching on, right?\nLast weekend was a chance to find out. Chef de cuisine Taylor Stark headed to the desert to join acclaimed chef Angelo Sosa at his J.W. Marriott restaurant Kembara in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an S. Pellegrino-sponsored event, A Taste of Mentorship.\nStark, along with his mentee chef Caleb Rocha, collaborated with Sosa, a “Top Chef” alum, and his mentee, Kembara’s chef de cuisine Penny Tagliarina, to create an eight-course menu featuring their interpretations of Asian classics in an intimate dining experience.\nAnd while the focus of the evening was on how chefs can bring up young talent in the culinary world, I couldn’t help but notice a discrete sous chef in the kitchen: Colorado.\nThanks to Stark’s hardline dedication to sustainability, many of his dishes had a bit of Colorado in them, from bison strip loin sourced from local farms and ranches to spruce tips cultivated at high altitude during the summer.\nStark ended the night by thanking everyone for the rare opportunity to take his food out of Denver. The Arizonans got to see how “transformative” and “powerful,” as Sosa described it, the Wolf’s Tailor is. But as I mentioned, we here in Colorado already knew that.\nThe Wolf’s Tailor is located at 4058 Tejon St., Denver, 80211. It’s open 5-9 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Be smart and make a reservation. thewolfstailor.com\nDanika Worthington | Presentation Editor\nSunLit: Sneak Peek In “Homestead,” a plot of frontier land leads to a quick courtship “He is not wide or tall in strap, but wiry, a spine set straight. She dares not turn her head around and sinks into her seat. Then a tap on her shoulder. On a scrap of paper he has written: 150 ACRES. ”\n— From “Homestead”\nEXCERPT: Author Melinda Moustakis’ debut novel “Homestead,” a finalist for the Colorado Book Awards, calls on her Alaskan roots and family history to create a stunning portrait of the everyday challenges of building a life and a relationship from a tract of government-issued land on the frontier. Her excerpt introduces the main characters, Lawrence and Marie, as well as the wilderness they will call home and the straightforward beginning of their connection.\nREAD THE SUNLIT EXCERPT\nTHE SUNLIT INTERVIEW: Moustakis’ first book, the short story collection “Bear Down, Bear North: Alaska Stories” told tales of three generations of this same homesteading family. For her first novel, she decided to zero in on one of those generations and tell their origin story. Here’s a portion of her Q&A:\nSunLit: Tell us this book’s backstory. What inspired you to write it? Where did the story/theme originate?\nMelinda Moustakis: “Homestead” was inspired by my maternal grandparents, who met in Anchorage and very quickly married and lived on an old school bus on 150 acres of a homestead claim in Point MacKenzie through their first winter waiting to build a cabin. The book takes place between 1956 and 1959. My grandmother was from Texas and met my grandfather on a trip to Anchorage while visiting her sister. They were married for 50 years, which I could wrap my head around, but what I could not imagine was the everydayness of being married to a practical stranger and living on a bus in the first winter of a marriage.\nSo the project came out of the question of how to survive one day at a time.\nREAD THE INTERVIEW WITH MELINDA MOUSTAKIS\nLISTEN TO A PODCAST WITH THE AUTHOR\nKevin Simpson | Writer\nSunday Reading List A curated list of what you may have missed from The Colorado Sun this week.\n💧 WATER MYTHS Cities in the West are booming.
