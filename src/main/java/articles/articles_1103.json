    "text": "A quick look at my calendar and the anticipation is building! It’s coming soon, my favorite day of the year: Valentine’s Day, this wonderful day when I can compensate for my love for my wife with chocolates and flowers. How wonderful. It truly touches my heart how advertising reminds us every year that our love is only truly worth anything if we spend our hard-earned money on flowers, chocolate and cards. Why do I need real feelings when I can buy them with an expensive box of chocolates? Practical thing. Santa Claus out, hearts in As soon as Santa Claus has disappeared from the shelves, they are filled with heart-shaped things. Thank you advertising industry, where would I be without you? I could practically pack my bags straight away. At least that’s what it suggests to me. The social pressure to give something to your partner makes it difficult for me to walk upright. If I don’t hand over at least a box of chocolates or a huge, overpriced rose, then I’ll be labeled a heartless chauvinist. Pah, the true feelings I have for my wife are pure beauty. Well, end of irony. Why I won’t give anything away this year either For my part, I definitely won’t be giving anything away this year either. Why? I love surprising my wife every day of the year. I show her my love every day, sometimes with roses. I find this capitalist idea of only showing your love on a certain day of the year completely absurd anyway. My dear ones, enjoy Valentine’s Day, but don’t forget that true love does not depend on material things, but on the small gestures and the time we spend with each other.",

La 14enne di Torino faceva parte del team di Benedetta Caretta, che a sua volta nel 2010 vinse la seconda edizione di Io Canto. \"È successo, ancora non posso crederci, è stata un’avventura incredibile: le amicizie, le cantate in hotel fino a tardi, le prove a casa e in studio, i costumi, le settimane che mi sembravano infinite prima di rivedervi, le videochiamate, gli abbracci, i pianti, le standing ovation, i voti, le esultanze, la mia squadra, la mia coach Benedetta Caretta con cui ho condiviso questo palco tantissime volte\", ha scritto Marta Viola sui social dopo la vittoria. E ha aggiunto: \"Sto davvero vivendo un sogno e prometto di continuare a cantare ancora e ancora con 'tutta l’anima che ho'. A presto\". Marta Viola nel 2019, a soli 10 anni, aveva rappresentato l'Italia in occasione dello \"Junior Eurovision Song Contest\". Durante la finale di Io Canto Generation, la 14enne ha portato a casa, oltre la vittoria, anche il Premio Tecnico Giuria e Radio.

    "text": "Ross Transportation Services, 36790 Giles Road in Grafton, recently honored two of its truck drivers, Duane Asmus and Ron Berkel, for reaching one million and two million miles driven without a traffic incident. Chris Fada, general manager at [Ross Transportation Services](https://rossenvironmental.com/services/transportation/), credited Asmus and Berkel for their dedication and care for their trade, which involves transporting toxic materials. “The level of commitment to make the decision to every day put safety first in the skilled trade that it truly is, is an amazing thing,” Fada said. “Truck drivers get a bad rap, but for them to deal with hauling what they haul in a way that puts their own safety and the safety of everyone else on the road as their number one priority, is a testament to their dedication.” Fada also noted the extra skills required to manage the large vehicles that Asmus and Berkel operate. “It takes an 80,000-pound vehicle 10 times as long to come to a stop than it does when I’m driving my van down the road,” Fada said. Fada said Ross Transportation Services drivers usually amass about 100,000 to 130,000 miles per year, which he said is not a huge amount in the trucking world. The one million or two million safe driving mile marks are so impressive because of the years of commitment it takes, he said. Asmus, who was hired in September 2013, took 10 years to reach his first million, while Berkel, who was hired in May 2001, took nine years to reach his second million, Fada said. The pair also joined a small group of Ross Transportation Services drivers to reach such milestones. Asmus became the 17th driver for Ross Transportation Services to earn one million safe driving miles, while Berkel is the third driver in company history to reach two million, Fada said. “They’ve joined a pretty elite group,” he said. Fada also said experienced drivers like Asmus and Berkel play a big role in preparing new hires at Ross Transportation Services to be just as safe. “The most important part of our onboarding process is the time that new hire drivers spend with our veteran drivers, and Ron and Duane are a part of that,” he said. Experienced drivers accompany new hires in the cab for about a month, if not longer, Fada said. “Nothing takes precedence over being safe and compliant, and these guys are a part of preaching that message to our new drivers,” he said.",

    "title": "Miracle Saves Group During Destructive Hailstorm",
    "text": "Unknown to any of the RFTW riders, a tornado had formed and was ripping its way east across the countryside straight toward Russell! “Later that day, after it was clear to leave the store, we stopped at a Walmart,” Gryder says. “The greeter, who evidently had heard other riders talking about their experience as they entered, spoke to me and we talked for a bit. Then he stated, ‘You know the miracle in this, right? Had you turned to go into Russell, your group could have run into the tornado that went through there!” According to a press release, the tornado sirens started going off in Russell around 3:30 p.m. At 4 p.m. the storm took out the power to the entire city. Although many vehicles were damaged by the storm, which also knocked down trees and power lines and damaged homes, no loss of life or serious injuries were noted. However, Gryder says there are number of variables, but he believes riders could have been on that road to Russell, depending on where they were in the pack, around the time of the tornado if leaders hadn’t decided to continue on. A group that large, even when going through a community, can be spread out over a mile and a half. In other words, a pretty large target. And even though the tornado apparently dissipated before striking the city, the falling trees and tree limbs, power wires, and flying debris in addition to the rain and hail, could have easily resulted in serious injuries. REFLECTION Gryder says that he’s thankful that the storm ended up keeping the ride from going through Russell that day, although it is a community the riders look forward to visiting. But even though the support by so many means a lot, for Gryder what means the most to him is having the opportunities every year to counsel individuals during the course of the 10-day ride. “I cannot really discuss the cases due to our commitment to confidentiality, but (counseling) encounters have dealt with everything from just being stressed to carrying guilt from things that happened in the heat of battle years ago,” he says. “We share comfort and hope. I just cannot give specific examples, though I wish I could because seeing Christ in action as He heals hearts and calm people’s mind is an amazing thing to watch.” This article originally appeared on AG News, and is reposted with permission.
