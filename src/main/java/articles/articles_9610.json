    "text": "Readers' wishes for Ramadan: Cease-fire in Gaza, peace on Earth and more empathy Updated March 10, 2024 at 2:31 PM ET Ramadan, the holiest month on the Islamic calendar, will begin on Monday, according to moon sightings in various countries. During this time, Muslims celebrate the month in which God revealed the first verses of the Quran to the prophet Muhammad. Those who observe Ramadan will fast from sun-up to sundown. At the end of the month, they celebrate a major holiday called Eid al-Fitr, or the \" [Festival of the Breaking of the Fast](https://ing.org/resources/for-all-groups/calendar-of-important-islamic-dates/ramadan-information-sheet/).\" \"The power of this month really is in the fact that every Muslim in the world is fasting and praying together in this holy month,\" Saman Naquvi of Brooklyn, N.Y., said. \"It drives home the fact that our community isn't just local but global.\" This year, NPR asked readers about their Ramadan prayers. More than 600 people responded. These were some of the major themes NPR readers are praying for and reflecting on. Responses have been edited for length and clarity. Peace in Gaza and the rest of the world Readers overwhelmingly wished for a cease-fire in Gaza. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to Gaza's health ministry. \"We all have personal prayers for ourselves and our loved ones,\" Huma Husain of Silver Spring, Md., said. \"This year however they are all overshadowed by one thing: cease-fire and a peaceful resolution in Gaza.\" Hundreds of readers included prayers for peace in other areas of the world as well. Many called for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7. \"I'm praying for the end of suffering for all those from [Palestinian territories] to Sudan to Congo,\" Nasra Nimaha of Hempstead, N.Y., said. Afshan Hamid, 57, wished for \"peace and justice for [Palestinian territories], Kashmir, Pakistan, Yemen, Rohingya Muslims and all people who are oppressed, [including] Ukrainian people [and] immigrants at our borders.\" \"I wish that Muslims, Jews, and Christians in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza could live together in peace,\" Randall Rick of Lone Tree, Colo., said. \"Outside the Middle East, I wish for peace in any land where there is conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims. Lastly, I wish for peace between any groups that are in conflict with each other.\" Family The health and happiness of family members stood out among readers' personal prayers. This year is the first Ramadan since Wajiha Akhtar's mom died. \"I'll be praying that she's no longer in pain,\" the 38-year-old said. Afifa Yusufi's mother has COPD and pneumonia. \"I'm praying [for her] ... to be with us a little longer,\" she said. \"I'm praying for all my family and friends and loved ones to be healthy and safe, and for people to care for their mental health.\" Zuhaira Razzack of Houston, Texas, wants her children to \"achieve success, happiness, love, security, and fulfillment in their lives and to maintain bonds of family, friendship and community.\" Sana Shaikh of Marlboro, N.J., wants her children to \"grow up as kind, giving and helpful human beings to their communities and world.\" The environment There was no shortage of prayers for the health of the Earth, either. \"I'm praying for a Ramadan of collective liberation and restoration of ecological balance on our bleeding mother Earth,\" Nazish Qureshi of Washington, D.C., said. Afhsan Hamid hopes humanity will be provided the \"intelligence and capacity to solve and lead climate change and environmental issues.\" And Hamza Ettarbaoui of Morocco said, \"I'm praying for a world [where] I can breathe clean air.\" Gratitude Many readers said they were reflecting on everything they have to be grateful for, especially while so much of the world is suffering. \"In the tranquil moments of Ramadan, our hearts are filled with gratitude for the blessings bestowed upon us,\" Wajeha Barakat of Raleigh, N.C., said. \"We seek peace not only within ourselves but also for our brothers and sisters around the world, hoping that the divine light of this sacred month will bring an end to conflicts and suffering.\" \"This Ramadan, I'm grateful for my life, my loved ones, my community, and my country,\" Nas Kazi of Yorba Linda, Calif., said. \"I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given and the ability to overcome any obstacles that may be in my future. I am also aware that many people around the world do not enjoy the same opportunities and their challenges are dire compared to what I endure.\" \"We are choosing to go without food and water so that we can acknowledge with gratitude that it is a choice we have the privilege to make,\" Saman Naquvi said. \"Others ... are not given the luxury of that choice. And so we will pray that they have food to break their fasts with, and shelter from the bombs to pray under and that they and their families will live long enough to celebrate Eid together.\" \"This is a bittersweet Ramadan as we get to open our fasts with an abundance of food while praying for babies and toddlers that are being starved to death,\" Nazia Sheriff, 43, said. \"Our hearts are so heavy as a community and carry a collective despair, the extent of which we can't even fully express.\" \"It feels wrong to be comfortable and enjoying life with my family while there are people out there who are starving and getting bombed at the same time,\" Natasha Kha of Newton, Mass., said. \"While fasting, I will be thinking about what the kids in Gaza go through while they are hungry. Yet it won't be the same because I will get to break my fast while they cannot.\" Free and fair elections and kind global leaders Many readers in America extended prayers to U.S. leaders and politicians as the nation gears up for a presidential election. Saima Ahmad of Suwanee, Ga., hopes for \"an outcome of the election that is best for the country.\" Minha Kauser of Vienna, Va., hopes the next president \"cares about building peace.\" Sophia Jafri of East Windsor, N.J., hopes for \"morally upright politicians who stand for all rights.\" Kimberly Alostaz is from Kuwait and now lives in Ohio. \"I am praying for morally strong, intelligent, knowledgeable, respectable, empathetic, humble and unbiased leaders around the world who are capable of truly making decisions that benefit their people and all people around the world,\" she said. More empathy and understanding As readers reflected on the many conflicts taking place around the world, they overwhelmingly called for more empathy, understanding and equality in humanity. \"I pray that every human being is given the same worth and value around the world; not based on the color of their skin, the God they follow or the city they live in,\" Zuleqa Husain of Silver Spring, Md., said. \"I pray for healing. I pray for justice. I pray for mercy. I pray for patience. I pray for steadfastness. I pray for the ability of humanity to move beyond base impulses to serve and deeply care for one another, this planet, and all that inhabit it,\" 38-year-old Nadia Massoud said. \"As a Palestinian, I'm praying that humanity and compassion prevail and that people recognize that killing, destruction and wars never solve any conflicts. Instead, they create more destruction,\" Hind Jarrah of McKinney, Texas, said. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "title": "This is where an ice storm could hit in the US this weekend",
    "text": "The Midwest is bracing for an ice storm in the coming days. The arctic blast impacting much of the continental U.S. may be ending soon, but one region is bracing another cold-related weather event this week. The eastern half of the U.S. from Minnesota to northern Florida and up to New England was blanketed in frigid conditions on Friday morning, a continuation of freezing temperatures experienced all over the country in recent days. Wind chills Friday morning were below zero degrees Fahrenheit in Minneapolis, near-zero in Chicago and in the teens and single digits in the Northeast. Temperatures are near freezing in northern Florida and southern Georgia, where a frost advisory was issued. Lake effect snow -- the result of cold air moving over the Great Lakes while they are still ice-free -- brought 3.5 feet of snow to western New York and up to 20 inches to northern lower Michigan on Thursday. Winds gusted to near 40 mph, creating whiteout conditions in heaviest lake-effect snow bands. On Friday morning, the lake effect snow warning continued for Ohio, Pennsylvania and western New York, where some areas could accumulate between 6 inches and a foot of snow, forecasts show. The cold air will last for one more day on Saturday before a moderating trend begins on Sunday and into next week for most of the East. However, a new storm system is moving into the Plains and the Midwest Friday into Saturday morning. The National Weather Service has issued an ice storm warning for Iowa and other ice alerts from Kansas to Minnesota. Cities like Des Moines, Minneapolis and Omaha are under alerts later from Friday and into Saturday morning. Freezing rain could glaze roads to more than a half an inch, creating treacherous driving conditions. What is an ice storm? Heavy precipitation when temperatures are below freezing can create an ice storm, according to the National Weather Service . Accumulations of ice can down trees, communication towers and utility poles, according to the NWS. In addition, ice storms can create black ice -- patchy ice on roadways or other transportation surfaces that cannot easily be seen -- and ice jams in lakes and streams, which can contribute to severe flooding, the NWS said. How to prepare for an ice storm The NWS advises residents under threat of a winter storm to make sure homes, vehicles and offices are stocked with necessary supplies, such as chargers, food, first aid kids, fuel and jumper cables. The agency also advised residents to make sure pets and farm animals have the essentials they need.",

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. People are also reading… Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

La vicesecretaria de Movilización y Reto Digital del PP, Noelia Núñez, ha expresado la \"repulsa\" de su partido en caso de que estas acusaciones sean los \"verdaderos motivos\" que han llevado Errejón a abandonar la política. \"Parece que era un secreto a voces en todos los ámbitos de la izquierda. Lo sabían, lo taparon y lo consintieron\", ha lamentado Núñez, que ha reclamado a Díaz que dé \"explicaciones\" y que \"aparte de sus responsabilidades\" a cualquiera otra persona que hubiera colaborado al encubrir las supuestas agresiones. El vicesecretario de Coordinación Autonómica y Local del PP, Elías Bendodo, ha ampliado las acusaciones a Pablo Iglesias. Núñez, además, ha equiparado las acusaciones existentes contra Errejón con las informaciones conocidas sobre el exministro de Transportes José Manuel Ábalos en relación con el caso Koldo. \"Este es el feminismo hipócrita de este gobierno, Pedro Sánchez con Ábalos y ahora la señora Yolanda Díaz con Errejón\", ha lanzado la vicesecretaria popular, que ha asegurado que \"si el agresor es de izquierdas se tapa porque lo único que interesa es el poder\". \"El gobierno que empezó con un pacto de perdedores continúa con un pacto de encubridores\", ha lanzado. Por otra parte, Núñez, en referencia a [la carta](https://www.elnacional.cat/es/politica/carta-inigo-errejon-deja-politica-texto-integro_1305898_102.html) donde Errejón ha justificado su salida de la política apelando al desgaste de la salud física, mental y emocional, ha reclamado que \"no se utilice la salud mental\" para tapar posibles situaciones de violencia machista. \"Consternación\" en Sumar, que da apoyo a las víctimas La secretaria de Comunicación de Sumar, Elizabeth Duval, ha asegurado que Errejón reconoció \"hechos moralmente reprobables\" después de que el partido le exigiera explicaciones a raíz de la denuncia anónima con acusaciones de actitudes machistas publicada en las redes contra él. Duval ha reconocido que en Sumar están \"consternados\" y ha lamentado que el exdiputado no cumple los \"estándares de ejemplaridad feminista, que se tiene que exigir a cualquier cargo político, a cualquier cargo público, pero particularmente a un cargo político de izquierdas\", según ha defendido en declaraciones en la Cadena Ser. Yolanda Díaz, que este jueves se encontraba de viaje en Bogotá, se ha limitado a lanzar un mensaje de apoyo a \"todas las mujeres que han dado un paso adelante\" para denunciar. \"No solo hace falta darles apoyo, hay que acompañarlas en lo que haga falta\", ha afirmado.",

    "title": "Mexico's \"Weed Nuns\" Launch Movement To Take Marijuana Back From Narcos",
    "text": "The \"weed nuns\" at their farm in Mexico. A group of women in Mexico is challenging the established norms, dressing as nuns and growing cannabis. According to The Independent , these \"weed nuns\" are pushing for the drug's legalisation to take it away from the country's narco groups. These women call themselves Sisters of the Valley and are part of an international movement founded in 2014 that promotes the healing power or cannabis. The group has a branch in California that sells CBD products in the US, while the Mexican group, consisting of five \"sisters\", grow cannabis crop, the outlet further said. \"What I have always wanted and what I am betting on is to take it (cannabis) back from the narco to make it legal,\" a group member who uses the moniker \"Sister Bernardet\" told The Independent . A video of the \"weed nuns\" is going viral on social media, but its location has not been revealed to protect the women. Mexico has a big majority of Catholics (75%), so the image of a nun puffin away a joint can rile some people, including the families of the women. \"The sisterhood is in a totally different context here in Mexico - because of how religious the country is and because of the plant's ties to cartels,\" Sister Bernardet told news agency Reuters. She is a homeopathic practitioner, and prescribes marijuana to those suffering from cancer, joint pain and insomnia. UK-based outlet Metro said these \"sisters\" tend to their plants producing cannabinoid salves. They are earning $10,000 every year, which is a fraction compared to the earnings of the California branch. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Due to the constant threat, the \"sisters\" have learned to be secretive in their business, drawing the curtains and drying their product in places that can't be easily found. The group's founder \"Sister Camilla\" helps to maintain the farm and support the group's logistics.",
