    "title": "Labora termina 2023 con más de 2.000 puestos de trabajo ofertados en su portal web",
    "text": "Hoy es 29 de diciembre y se habla de VALÈNCIA (EP). Labora, el Servicio Valenciano de Empleo y Formación, oferta actualmente en su portal web PuntLABORA más de 2.000 puestos de trabajo a los que pueden optar todas aquellas personas inscritas en el organismo público. Para poder acceder a estas ofertas las personas deben estar dadas de alta en el mismo. A cualquiera de los puestos ofertados pueden optar personas tanto desempleadas como ocupadas. Una vez inscritas, para acceder a las ofertas de PuntLABORA sólo es necesario identificarse con el DNI/NIE y el pin. Posteriormente, las personas interesadas pueden buscar por palabras clave según el ámbito laboral y/o escoger la provincia si no tienen tan definido el puesto de trabajo, ha indicado la Generalitat en un comunicado. En los puestos de trabajo, la ciudadanía dispone de información como la descripción de las tareas, requisitos y condiciones laborales. Asimismo, cada oferta dispone de un código de referencia que permite a las personas poder consultar en su Espai Labora en caso de duda. Si procede, la persona aplicante podrá indicar qué le interesa y empezar el proceso de candidatura. Cabe recordar que son las empresas de la Comunitat las que ponen las ofertas en el portal PuntLABORA y las que realizan la selección entre las personas que se presenten y cumplan con los requisitos que demanden. Al respecto, Labora acaba de reforzar su plantilla de personal especialista en empresas con 54 nuevos profesionales, con el objetivo de captar más ofertas de empleo para las personas desempleadas de la Comunitat. En este sentido, es muy importante que las personas tengan su demanda de empleo actualizada, con todos los datos de formación y experiencia al día. Este proceso se realiza en Labora a través de la autoentrevista. Cada vez que se quiera aplicar a una oferta, no hará falta rellenar nuevamente los datos personales; la formación (méritos académicos); el empleo (experiencia laboral realizada fusionada con aquella demandada), y la disponibilidad horaria, los conocimientos informáticos, el carné de conducir u otros carnés, puesto que ya estará introducido en el sistema. No obstante, el sistema permite incorporar además un currículum en formato .pdf para cada inscripción, ya que deja añadir información complementaria que en la autoentrevista no queda recogida, como cursos no reglados y voluntariados, entre otros. Hasta este mes de diciembre ya se han superado las 33.000 ofertas laborales difundidas a la ciudadanía a nivel de la Comunitat Valenciana. Otro de los servicios que ofrece Labora es el de las ofertas de empleo a nivel europeo. Para ello, la red Eures se convierte en un servicio que se ha demostrado especialmente útil. Este portal de cooperación europea de servicios de empleo diseñado para facilitar la libre circulación de las personas trabajadoras permite realizar una investigación más cuidadosa y filtrar más específicamente, como por ejemplo qué país de la Unión Europea se desea, el sector o la profesión.",

    "text": "USU Eastern Tax Lab Celebrates 42 Years of Community Service By [Marcus Jensen](mailto:marcus.jensen@usu.edu) | PRICE, Utah — It all started with a simple concept: give students an opportunity for work experience while providing the community with a service. That was the idea behind the tax lab at Utah State University Eastern, which is entering its 42nd year of service. The lab was founded by Henning Olsen, who entered his 50th year of teaching at USU Eastern. Olsen started the student service in 1982, when the college was known as the College of Eastern Utah. The tax lab was the first of its kind in the state of Utah. Olsen has seen the changes that have taken place at the lab over its 42 years, with the evolution of technology and the changes in the tax system. “When we taught our first Income Tax Course in 1982, we filed paper tax returns in the old lunchroom on the second floor of the Main Building where there were long tables to stack papers,” Olsen said. “We were ranked among the top first-year programs in the Western Region by the IRS. We were the first college in Utah to file paper tax returns; then the first to file computer tax returns; and then the first to electronically file as we prepared returns through the 1980s and 1990s.” Since the program’s inception, Olsen and his students have helped community members file thousands of tax returns. The tax service is offered free of charge to USU Eastern students as well as local low-income individuals and seniors who live in Emery and Carbon counties. According to Olsen, in a single tax season the lab has helped people receive a combined $500,000 in tax refunds. “The tax lab at USU Eastern is another way that USU seeks to serve the community in Carbon and Emery counties,” said Doug Miller, chief campus administrator at USU Eastern. “The work that Henning and his students perform is a great tradition, and one that is highly impactful in our community.” The lab is run by Olsen and his students in the USU Technology, Design, and Technical Education program. The lab is part of a two-credit course that helps students learn basic finance while also gaining real-world experience in the field. Throughout the lab, Olsen reminds his students of the public service they are performing for those who need it. “We are in our 42nd year of preparing tax returns for the community that Utah State University serves,” Olsen said. “In training one of our students this year, I told him he would have a sense of satisfaction in serving low-income people who could not prepare their own taxes. After he prepared a lady’s tax return in our first day of operation, he remarked. ‘I do feel better.’” Olsen is quick to give credit to many others who have made the lab a success over the years. He especially wanted to thank Linda Jensen, who has helped been doing taxes for 32 years, and Hank Savage, who provided VITA service for 27 years. “For all those years, Linda and Hank have been the ‘heart’ of our USUE VITA Center in serving our communities,” Olsen said. “After 27 years of VITA service, Hank moved to Utah County where he volunteered and was awarded the LT. Governor’s Power of Service Award as a VITA volunteer. Linda continues to be a very valued participant in the USUE VITA Center.” The tax lab at USU Eastern is now accepting appointments for tax return assistance. Those who are eligible and would like assistance with their tax return are encouraged to contact Henning Olsen to set up an appointment. Olsen can be contacted at [henning.olsen@usu.edu](mailto:henning.olsen@usu.edu) or by calling (435) 613-5219. The tax lab is located in the Reeves Building accounting lab. Located in picturesque Price, Utah State University Eastern provides the best of both worlds for students– the personalized attention and small student-to-faculty ratio of a small-town college, with the educational opportunities and resources of a large university. USU Eastern boasts student government opportunities, clubs and programs like theater, choir, and the award-winning student newspaper “The Eagle”, as well as its own athletic program. USU Eastern provides personal or professional development training, technical education in Health Professions, Technical Careers and Business, as well as associate, bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees and certificates of proficiency.

    "text": "UK weather: Hundreds of homes still without power after Storm Gerrit Storm Gerrit brought chaos to roads, railway lines, airports, and ferry services nationwide earlier in the week - and the disruption isn't over as the new year beckons. Friday 29 December 2023 07:13, UK Hundreds of homes are still without power after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc across northern England and Scotland. The chaotic weather [has delivered everything from heavy snow to a damaging tornado](https://news.sky.com/story/uk-weather-tornado-hits-greater-manchester-and-thousands-still-without-power-in-scotland-in-wake-of-storm-gerrit-13038743), ruining many people's journeys home from Christmas festivities. Around 450 properties in [Scotland](https://news.sky.com/topic/scotland-5866) are still suffering electricity outages. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) hopes to restore power to the remaining households on Friday and welfare vans serving hot food and drink will be open to customers in the meantime. 'Absolute disaster' The storm is also still being felt in northern England and Wales. Stalybridge, Tameside, and Carrbrook in [Greater Manchester](https://news.sky.com/topic/greater-manchester-6937) are in a \"recovery phase\", local authorities have said, after they were hit by a rare tornado that toppled trees and damaged homes. The freak whirlwind was thought to have been caused by a supercell thunderstorm, and residents said it had left some homes looking like \"an absolute disaster\". Elsewhere, three men died after their 4x4 vehicle [was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale](https://news.sky.com/story/yorkshire-three-men-die-after-4x4-plunges-into-river-13038772). In Wales, 36,000 properties were left without power after lightning struck in Ceredigion. Travel disruption set to continue Storm Gerrit brought chaos to roads, railway lines, airports, and ferry services nationwide earlier in the week - and the disruption isn't over as the weekend beckons. The Met Office has said the final days of 2023 will see more strong wind, rain, and snow, though there are no weather warnings in place. But the Environment Agency has 33 active flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, covering rivers including the Severn and Ouse.

While many lines have reopened since the storm blew through, services could still be suspended or cancelled due to system faults and damage. The London Euston and Watford Junction lines are not expected to be fully online until the end of Friday, while Welsh train services are expected to be hampered until Monday. Ferries are also still expecting trouble, with journeys between Dover and France impacted by wind.",

    "text": "Treatment emerges for rare, symptomless heart condition in Cytokinetics drug trial [James Powel](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12244761002/james-powel/) A new drug to treat a rare heart condition may be set to go before the Food and Drug Administration. Pharmaceutical company Cytokinetics [announced Wednesday](https://ir.cytokinetics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-positive-results-sequoia-hcm-pivotal) that its drug aficamten produced, \"statistically significant and clinically meaningful\" results in the phase three trial of the [drug](/story/news/2023/12/25/weight-loss-abortion-drug-prices-psychedelics-hot-topics-of-2024/72027935007/). Aficamten is intended to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition that thickens the heart muscle and is present in .2% of the world's population, [according to the National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430788/). The company said in its press release that full results of the study would be presented at, \"an upcoming medical conference.\" If the drug does make it to market it would compete against Bristol Meyer's drug Camzyos. \"A therapy like aficamten that improves exercise capacity in a clinically meaningful manner, absent low (left ventricular ejection fraction) events that interrupt treatment, should be a welcome addition for HCM patients as well as the clinicians who treat them,\" Martin Maron, M.D., Director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts and principal investigator for the trial said. Cytokinetics stock closed down a quarter of a percent at [$83.24 per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK) Thursday but is still up significantly from [Tuesday's close of $45.71](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK/history?p=CYTK). What did the phase three trial find? Patients in the trial arm saw improvement in exercise tolerance, peak oxygen uptake and \"clinically meaningful improvements\" in the study's secondary endpoints including participant's Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score, according to the release. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score is a test that measures, \"symptoms, physical and social limitations, and quality of life in patients with heart failure,\" [according to the Journal of American College of Cardiology](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.542). Serious adverse effects occurred in 5.6% of people in the trial arm and 9.3% of people in the placebo arm. What is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and makes it more difficult to pump blood, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198). The condition is usually caused by genetics and does not cause symptoms in many cases. Symptoms, if they are experienced, can include: - Chest pain - Fainting - Heart murmur - Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations) - Shortness of breath The Mayo Clinic recommends seeking immediate medical attention if a person is experiencing rapid or irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing or chest pain. Loyola Marymount basketball star [Hank Gathers](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1201/p738.html) was killed by a cardiac arrest during a game in 1990 and his autopsy found that he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

    "title": "Firefly Aerospace To Launch True Anomaly’s Spacecraft For VICTUS HAZE, Additional Missions - Defense Daily",
    "text": "True Anomaly on Thursday said it has selected Firefly Aerospace\nto launch its Jackal spacecraft for the U.S. Space Force’s VICTUS HAZE Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) mission expected to occur no later than fall 2025.\nFirefly will also launch two additional missions for True Anomaly between 2025 and 2027.\nThe Space Force in April awarded separate contracts to Rocket Lab [RKLB] and True Anomaly for VICTUS HAZE to demonstrate rendezvous and proximity operations with commercially-built assets to counter irresponsible behavior on orbit ( Defense Daily , April 11). True Anomaly will use an upgraded version of its Jackal autonomous orbital vehicle that can perform multi-orbit missions with a high acceleration and high delta-V propulsion system that is being developed with its propulsion supplier, Agile Space Industries.\nRocket Lab said previously it will launch its spacecraft aboard its own Electron rocket.\nThe VICTUS HAZE mission follows the VICTUS NOX TacRS mission, which involved the rapid launch of a satellite provided by a Boeing [BA] business unit aboard Firefly’s Alpha launch vehicle on Sept. 15, 2023 for a space domain awareness mission. The VICTUS NOX mission showcased launch-ready status within 24 hours of launch notice, liftoff within several hours of the launch window opening, and satellite checkout 11 hours ahead of the two-day goal ( Defense Daily , Sept. 15 and 26, 2023).\nTrue Anomaly described four phases it is executing for VICTUS HAZE: build, hot standby, launch, and on-orbit operations. The Colorado-based satellite manufacturer and software developer will complete development and testing of Jackal at its GravityWorks facility in Denver, transport it to Firefly’s SLC-2 payload processing facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., for fueling, integration, and encapsulation in Alpha’s fairing, and then both companies will enter the hot-standby phase.\nOnce the Space Force provides the launch notice, Firefly has 24 hours to bring the payload fairing to the launch pad, mate it to Alpha, fuel the rocket, and launch within the first window. Once deployed, True Anomaly will begin on-orbit operations with Jackal that will include operating near Rocket Lab’s spacecraft.\nJason Kim, Firefly’s CEO, posted on LinkedIn that, because the company conducted the first TacRS launch for the Space Force under VICTUS NOX, “we know how to do it even better on VICTUS HAZE!”\nTrue Anomaly said the two additional launches with Firefly gives it access to responsive capacity.\n“The procurement of additional rapid, responsive launch capacity from Firefly beyond VICTUS HAZE, paired with True Anomaly’s rapid manufacturing capability, will enable standing capacity for the U.S. National Security Space enterprise to rapidly respond to mission requirements in low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit.\nBeyond VICTUS HAZE, Space Force’s Space Systems Command has two more TacRS efforts planned, VICTUS SURGO and VICTUS SALO, which are planned for launch in late summer of early fall 2006 for the former and late 2026 for the latter. These missions, which include Impulse Space spacecraft, will leverage commercial solutions to demonstrate how pre-positioning highly maneuverable on-orbit space domain awareness assets can complement responsive launch approaches.",
