An Excessive Heat Warning will go into effect for the District and I-95 Corridor and points southeast, with a Heat Advisory for most of the DMV until 8 p.m. Heat and humidity combined will make it feel much hotter than the actual air temperature. The heat index could make it feel as hot as 110 degrees in some areas. In addition to the heat, there is a chance for showers and storms, anytime between 5 p.m. - 11 p.m. There is a small chance for one or two of the storms to become strong to severe, producing strong gusty winds. Some storms may also produce heavy rain, which could make it difficult to see while driving or lead to water ponding on the roads. Storms will be spaced out, so not everyone will see a storm.

O presidente tinha feito uma manifestao pblica de que a carne tinha que estar na cesta bsica porque afinal de contas o acesso protena animal tem que ser garantido a todos os brasileiros\", diz o ministro no vdeo. \"Ns conseguimos vencer a oposio e colocar a carne na cesta bsica.\"\nAo longo da tramitao da reforma na Cmara, integrantes do governo afirmaram que Haddad no se opunha incluso da carne entre os produtos que no seriam tributados.\nApesar disso, aps reunio com Lira e lderes da Casa , o ministro disse que a ampliao do \"cashback\" na regulamentao da reforma tributria poderia compensar a ausncia de protena animal na lista de produtos da cesta bsica .\nO presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva durante lanamento do plano Safra de Agricultura familiar no Palcio do Planalto.

Lula tambm deu declaraes pblicas sobre o assunto, ao defender a iseno de impostos para o frango .\nDurante lanamento do Plano Safra 2024/2025 , Lula disse ainda que os empresrios no precisam ter compromisso ideolgico com o governo e defendeu tirar imposto da carne.\nO volume de protena animal consumida no pas torna a medida um forte apelo popular, alm de atender a uma das promessas de campanha de Lula, de que os brasileiros voltassem a comer carne , como a picanha.\nNa publicao, a primeira-dama e o ministro iniciam o vdeo celebrando a deciso de equiparar os planos de sade para animais situao fiscal dos veterinrios, o que barateia os convnios.

    "text": "BARTLESVILLE, Okla. — The Bartlesville area is moving out of the drought stages as water continues to flow into the city's primary water supply source, Hulah Lake, after heavy rains in southeastern Kansas during Christmas weekend. The City of Bartlesville has lifted water restrictions after heavy rains filled Hulah Lake. \"Rains that started over the Christmas holiday have had a significant impact on our water supply, increasing Hulah Lake levels by 3.5 feet as of today,\" Water Utilities Director Terry Lauritsen said. \"Now, a week later, water continues to flow into the lake. This has moved us out of all stages of the Water Shortage Ordinance for the first time since December 2022.\" Bartlesville's overall water remaining is 72.1%, which is about 20% higher than it was a month ago. Bartlesville city leaders say it’s not a matter of if, but when the city will have to up its water restrictions. The city is also looking into emergency water supply plans, for if the drought continues. Weighted water supply is sitting at 128% which exceeds the required 95% for stage one of the water shortage ordinance. \"Because we rely most heavily on Hulah Lake for our water supply, as that is where we have the most water right, we really couldn't be in a better situation than we are now,\" Lauritsen said. \"Hopefully, we will continue to see enough rain in the Hulah watershed to keep us out of all drought contingency plan stages as we continue to seek additional water sources to meet future weather and climate-related challenges.\" Some people in Bartlesville are going to be paying more for water as the town brings in restrictions and a rate increase to deal with a water shortage. Even though Bartlesville and surrounding water customers have seen an improvement, other communities that rely on Copan Lake are still struggling with drought issues. \"They desperately need rain in the Copan Lake watershed area,\" said Lauritsen. The drought continues to wreak havoc on Bartlesville’s water supply. It’s just over half capacity leaving many families rationing their water usage.",

    "text": "Produced by: Mohsin Shaikh\nBeneath Antarctica’s icy façade lies a massive network of over 100 active volcanoes, kept in check by the crushing weight of ice. But as the ice melts, the threat of eruptions looms closer.\nRepresentative pic\nA study in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems reveals how melting ice is reducing pressure on magma chambers, destabilizing them and potentially triggering volcanic eruptions.\nAs ice thins, the Earth’s crust loses its suppressive weight. Magma decompression begins, releasing trapped gases, which increase internal pressure and the likelihood of eruptions.\nVolcanic eruptions generate heat that melts more ice, which in turn exposes more bedrock and allows magma to rise, creating a self-sustaining cycle of fire and ice.\nRepresentative pic\nAntarctica’s volcanic awakening isn’t just a local threat. Rising sea levels and injected volcanic gases, like CO2, could alter weather systems and accelerate global warming.\nWest Antarctica’s melting ice sheet could raise sea levels by several meters, but volcanic heat could cause the destabilized sheet to collapse faster than current predictions suggest.\nAsh and aerosols from under-ice eruptions may disrupt atmospheric conditions, warming the Southern Ocean and compounding the climate crisis on a global scale.\nRepresentative pic\nScientists warn that even if human emissions stopped, the melting and eruption cycle could perpetuate itself, making this a long-term, autonomous threat.\nRepresentative pic\nAdvanced monitoring technologies, including satellite imaging and remote sensing, are essential to track Antarctic volcanic activity and prepare for the cascading impacts of this hidden danger.\nRepresentative pic",

    "text": "Учёные обнаружили опасные уровни излучения в салоне при разгоне, особенно в китайских гибридах. Напряжённость электрического поля достигает 200 В/м, что в восемь раз превышает допустимые нормы. Это может вызвать онкологические заболевания, неврологические нарушения и депрессию.\nМойка78 пишет, что электромобили и гибриды создают мощные электромагнитные поля из-за мощных систем и высоковольтных проводов. В обычных автомобилях излучение периодическое, в электромобилях — постоянное.\nИсследователи рекомендуют улучшить систему электромагнитной защиты в гибридных автомобилях.\nИсследование не указывает конкретную модель автомобиля, но результаты могут быть применимы ко всем китайским гибридам.\nЭтот анализ появился на фоне новостей о высокой доле китайских автомобилей на складах российских дилеров (200–250 тысяч) из-за повышения утилизационного сбора. В 2025 году продажи китайских авто снизились на 25,3% из-за высокой ключевой ставки и дорогих автокредитов.\nРоссийское автопроизводство также сталкивается с проблемами: переполненные склады, четырёхдневная рабочая неделя на заводах и снижение продаж российских машин.\nБудущее автопрома в России зависит от экономической ситуации и стоимости автомобилей.",
