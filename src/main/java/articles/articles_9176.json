    "text": "Spät aber doch hat sich die Bundesregierung geeinigt: Ab Mitte 2034 sollen Vollspaltenböden in der österreichischen Schweinehaltung verboten werden. Das hat der „Standard“ am Mittwochabend berichtet. Ursprünglich wurde in einer Novelle des Tierschutzgesetzes im Juli 2022 eine Übergangsfrist bis zum Jahr 2040 beschlossen, die nach einer Klage der burgenländischen Landesregierung vom Verfassungsgerichtshof gekippt wurde. Bis zum 1. Juni musste eine neue Übergangsfrist präsentiert werden, andernfalls würde das Verbot mit sofortiger Wirkung in Kraft treten. Das hätte die Branche mit 24.000 Schweinehaltern in ein Chaos gestürzt. Das bleibt nun wohl aus.\nDie Koalition aus ÖVP, SPÖ und Neos einigte sich auf eine verkürzte Übergangsfrist bis 1. Juni 2034. Dabei soll es sich um einen verfassungskonformen Kompromiss handeln, heißt es gegenüber der Kleinen Zeitung. Am Freitag soll die Novelle im Gesundheitsausschuss durchgewunken und nächste Woche im Plenum abgestimmt werden.\nEtwas mehr Platz ab 2029 und Kritik von Tierschutzorganisationen\nAb 2029 soll es zudem erste Verbesserungen geben: Beschäftigungsmaterial wie Strohraufen sollen kommen sowie geringere Besatzdichten: Das bedeutet 0,8 statt 0,7 Quadratmeter Platz pro schlachtreifem Mastschwein. Für Neubauten gilt bereits jetzt das Vollspaltenverbot, Betriebe die seit 2018 noch im alten System umgebaut haben, bekommen nun einen Aufschub von 16 Jahren für die Adaptierung. Von Tierschutzorganisationen wie Vier Pfoten und dem VGT wurde das Vollspalten-Verbot nicht als solches akzeptiert, wenn Schweine nicht doppelt so viel Platz und Stroheinstreu bekommen.\nFlorian Eder, Redakteur Steiermark-Ressort",

    "text": "French power giant EDF said on Friday it returned to profit and cut its debt by about 10 billion euros ($10.76 billion) in 2023 due to the increase in electricity prices and after a chunk of its nuclear fleet reopened. It booked a 7.9 billion euro impairment related to its UK operations, including the long-delayed Hinkley Point reactor, which is costing much more than expected. \"We are in discussions with the British government and other investors to arrange financing for the Sizewell C project,\" EDF CEO Luc Remont said on a media call referring to another new plant in south-east England. The electricity company recorded a net profit for 2023 of 10 billion euros, compared to a loss of 17.9 billion in 2022 and an EBITDA of 39.9 billion euros, up from a loss of 4.9 billion a year earlier. State-owned EDF, which runs Europe's largest nuclear fleet, took several reactors offline in 2022 to carry out checks and repairs after signs of stress corrosion were discovered at some. Its French nuclear production rose by some 41.4 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023 to 320.4 TWh as France faced historically high electricity market prices. The group said it expects nuclear power output to rise again in 2024.

    "title": "Emir of Kuwait dissolves the National Assembly and takes aim at the Muslim Brotherhood",
    "text": "Steven Sahiounie, journalist and political commentator\nDr. Waleed al-Tabtabai, a former Kuwaiti member of the National Assembly, and a man integrally involved in the fundraising of the Radical Islamic terrorists who invaded Syria and killed thousands of unarmed civilians, was arrested by Kuwaiti authorities on May 12, after he posted on his X account, formerly Twitter.\nIn the post, al-Tabtabai accused unnamed countries of interfering in Kuwait’s internal affairs, calling this “unacceptable” and expressed hope that the National Assembly would be reinstated “with all its constitutional powers”.\nExperts suspect al-Tabtabai was referring to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who have both cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood in an effort to reform their countries into places of peace and prosperity.\nOn Sunday, Kuwait’s public prosecution issued a statement saying it had ordered the arrest of one person and the detention of others, on the grounds that they had posted “expressions” on their X accounts “containing attacks on the rights and authority” of Kuwait’s emir.\nAl-Tabtabai obtained a PhD in Islamic studies from Al-Azhar University, and was an assistant professor at Kuwait University before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996.\nKuwait is in a process of reform, and purging the National Assembly of Muslim Brotherhood influence and domination. Egypt and Tunisia both threw off their “Arab Spring” cloak of Muslim Brotherhood domination which had been imposed on them by President Barak Obama, to benefit American and Israeli interests.\nDuring the US-NATO attack on Syria for regime change, Kuwaiti MPs, as well as Salafi clerics were funding and exporting armed terrorists, who they referred to as “jihadis”.\nThe Kuwaiti ruling family did not publically support the funding of terrorists in Syria beginning in 2011, but instead turned a blind eye to the operation to overthrow the Damascus government, which was unsuccessful.\nKuwait had been a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. The National Assembly consists of 50 elected members who represent different constituencies across the country.\nThe Emir holds extensive powers, including the ability to dissolve the National Assembly, dismiss the Prime Minister, and issue decrees. The ruling Al-Sabah family has been in power for centuries, and this has led to criticism of limited political reforms.\nEmir of Kuwait, Sheikh Mishal Al Ahmed Al Sabah, said on May 11 he would suspend the parliament for up to four years, declaring that he had made the move “to save the country”.\n“Unfortunately, we have faced some unimaginable, unbearable difficulties and impediments,” the 83-year-old said on Friday, according to the state news agency, a reference to the gridlock that has held back Kuwait’s development.\n“We were left with no option other than taking this hard decision to rescue the country and protect its higher national interests and resources of the nation,” said Sheikh Mishal, and he added, “I will not allow that democracy which will be exploited to destroy the state.”\nThe leader of Kuwait was wrestling with the ever present gridlock in the National Assembly due to the overwhelming chaos produced by its’ members following the Muslim Brotherhood, which stands on the same political platform as ISIS, Al Qeada, and other such terrorist groups cut from the same cloth.\nAl-Tabtabai is a follower of Radical Islam, which is a political ideology, and is not a religion or a sect. He is one of the chief supporters of funding the terrorist groups in Syria.\nKuwait, one of the few semi-democratic countries in the Middle East, and the parliament has only been in existence for one month, having been elected in April 2024, with opposition MPs gaining the majority of the seats. It has not even met yet before the Emir’s dissolution decree.\nAl-Tabtabai has been convicted of numerous crimes in the past, but while serving in the National Assembly enjoyed immunity. In December 2019, the former Emir of Kuwait pardoned him of past crimes. Now, with a new leader on the throne since December 12, 2023, al-Tabtabai has been arrested, and will face the full wrath of the law.\nHis arrest is not just the downfall of one man, but is a collective punishment of all the Muslim Brotherhood followers in Kuwait in the National Assembly or clerics, who have prevented the Kuwaiti government from necessary reforms to promote the peace and prosperity of all citizens.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood threat to Kuwait\nAlthough, Kuwait has among the largest oil reserves in the world, it lags far behind the dramatic pace of development as compared to its neighbors Saudi Arabia and UAE.\nAccording to Hussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), all Arab countries that witnessed change between 2004 and 2011 saw Islamists climb the ladder of democratic election to take over government. In Kuwait a hybrid system emerged that allowed for a free press and the democratic election of the National Assembly, but kept the last word for the Emir. Kuwait came close to being a constitutional monarchy.\nEvery time Kuwait elected its representatives and formed a cabinet, the gridlock returned. With a population of a million or so, it was expected to compete with Dubai and Abu Dhabi in terms of growth and attraction. Yet, the democratic gridlock inhibited growth, and the once-shiny Kuwait City became shabby and backward compared with its oil-rich peers.\nOne of the main problems of the Kuwaiti democracy was its Muslim Brotherhood, whose lawmakers undermined the government at every turn. Democracy had become synonymous with Islamist tyranny, where elections are held routinely, but the rule of law is always absent.\nAl-Tabtabai the fundraiser\nSince 2011, al-Tabtabai and other Kuwaitis were donating millions of dollars to fund the terrorists in Syria, who were not only targeting the government, but who were killing unarmed Syrian civilians in their homes and in the streets. The monies were flown from Kuwait to Turkey and Jordan, where the cash was distributed to the various terrorist groups.\nBecause Kuwait has been a US ally for decades, it was compliant with a directive from the Obama Oval Office to support the US-NATO attack on Syria.\nThe US, UK, France, Turkey and Jordan set up the “Friends of Syria” group which allowed for donations outside the official channels to supply funds and supplies to the terrorists. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar were among the biggest supporters of the US-NATO project, which supported Jabhat al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Islam, and Al Qaeda.\nIn 2014, the Kuwaiti role involved not only creating military operation rooms and directing the course of certain battles, but also giving direct orders to commit massacres and then boasting about them.\nAl-Tabtabai in Syria with the terrorists\nAl-Tabtabai is known as the director of the siege and massacre of Nubl and al-Zahraa. He made sure that the aid collected in Kuwait reached the terrorists either in the form of cash to cover the fighters’ salaries, or in the form of arms shipments, by numerous personal visits to Syria. One of his visits to Idlib lasted four months during which he participated in planning some attacks on civilians. Today, Idlib is the last terrorist controlled area in Syria, and is commanded by Mohammed al-Julani, formerly of ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Jibhat al-Nusra and currently the head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The US, UK and the UN continue to supply Idlib with truck-loads of humanitarian aid which first passes through the hands of Julani and his militia.\nIn September 2013, al-Tabtabai appeared in a video clip on Youtube during his participation in preparing and launching Grad missiles at Latakia, west of Idlib. The terrorists thanked al-Tabtabai for his support during the siege imposed on the two towns of Nubl and al-Zahraa in the Aleppo countryside. Those villages were populated by civilians who were Shite Muslims. The massacre of men, women and children carried out over months of attacks by the al-Tabtabai supported terrorists were purely sectarian in nature, and had no military objective of bringing down the Syrian government.\nIn June 2013, a massacre was committed in the village of Hatla in Deir al-Zour’s countryside in which 60 victims were killed. People were killed with Kuwaiti knives and purely for sectarian reasons. Just like al-Nusra Front boasted at the time that it “cleansed Hatla of the Shia,” Kuwaiti Sheikh Shafi al-Ajami boasted of “slaughtering Shias with knives” amidst cheers and cries of “God is great.”\nSaudi, Qatari and Kuwaiti media outlets celebrated the massacre each in its own way. When a journalist from Asia News Agency asked Ajami a few days later “if he feared that the Kuwaiti authorities might arrest him,” he replied: “This is an issue that concerns me and the Kuwaiti authorities,” who did not lift a finger.\nThe Council of Supporters, of Kuwait, was behind the creation of the Damascus operations room in September 2013. It included Jaysh al-Islam, al-Furqan Brigades, al-Habib al-Mustafa Brigades, the Islamic Ahrar al-Sham Movement, the Companions Brigades and Battalions and the Army of the Muslims Brigade.\nOne Salafist group in Kuwait, the Great Kuwait Campaign, had been so successful in raising money for terrorist groups that twelve thousand terrorists were fully armed as a result of their pledges in 2013.\nThe campaign was publicly launched in June 2013, at the same time as the Hatla massacre, and was titled: “Kuwait’s Major Campaign to Prepare 12,000 Invaders for Syria.” The campaign collected 8.4 million Kuwait dinars (about US$ 30 million), and its main promoter was al-Tabtabai.\nIn June 2013, al-Tabtabai was working alongside a terrorist group in Syria’s Aleppo that gathered and trained armed men to fight in Syria. Tabtabai spoke to al-Jazeera TV and said it was the final day of training for more than 3,000 armed men who have newly arrived in Aleppo. He said another 1,000 militants will be “graduated” in northwestern city of Idlib the following day. Al-Tabtabai said they had promised the Syria militants to train 12,000 terrorists to send to Syria.\nHypocrisy\nOn January 28, 2019 a Kuwaiti court sentenced al-Tabtabai to seven years in jail for failing to tell his wife he divorced her and continuing to have sexual relations with her. She only found out about the divorce when he refused to support his newborn daughter. Regardless of his pious Islamic reputation, he broke Islamic law by having relations with a woman outside of marriage, and forced his ex-wife to also commit a sin, unknowingly, for his pleasure. At the time, he was outside Kuwait and already facing a 42-month jail term handed down in July 2018 in another case for storming parliament and assaulting police.\nKuwait reforms\nKuwait has been actively pursuing major developments and reforms to diversify its economy and revamp its infrastructure.\nKuwait’s Vision 2035 has taken center stage, aiming to transform the nation into a regional powerhouse by diversifying its economy, reducing reliance on oil revenues, and increasing private sector participation. The government is actively working to attract foreign investment, foster innovation, and enhance the ease of doing business.\nKuwait is steadfast in improving its infrastructure and enhancing connectivity to position itself as a business and tourism hub. Remarkable advancements have been made in renewable energy sources, with the country aiming to produce 15% of its electricity from renewables by 2030.\nIn Syria, where the Kuwaitis helped to destroy the country and infrastructure, currently the people have only three hours of electricity per day.\nKuwait deeply values its cultural heritage and is investing in the revival and preservation of its historical sites and landmarks, such as the UNESCO World Heritage Site nominations for Failaka Island and the city of Al-Jahra.\nIn Aleppo, Syria, according to the UN, the oldest continuously inhabited city on earth, the Kuwaitis participated in the wholesale destruction of antiquities far surpassing anything that Kuwait has.\nKuwait’s new initiatives aim to promote artists, galleries, museums and cultural centers to boost tourism.\nBefore the Syrian war began in 2011, in which the Kuwaitis participated, Syria was voted as the safest tourist destination in the Mediterranean region by the French Association of Tourist Agents in their annual conference.\nKuwait now wants to increase women’s participation in the workforce, while in Syria women have full rights the same as men in the civil code, and are doctors, lawyers, judges, and a past Speaker of the Syrian Parliament was a woman.\nSteven Sahiounie is a two-time award-winning journalist\nThis article is originally published at Stratgic culture foundation",

    "text": "En la antesala de la fecha 13 en Liga BetPlay 2025-I, se ha generado una controversia que relaciona al Deportivo Cali y Águilas Doradas, quienes se darán cita este viernes 11 de abril en territorio vallecaucano.\nEl cuadro de Alfredo Arias tiene la misión de permanecer con un lugar entre los ocho, mientras que los de Rionegro, buscan volver al triunfo tras caer en el más reciente juego contra Llaneros.\nA través de las redes sociales, es común que los equipos envíen mensajes, fotografías y videos, en el marco de la previa de cada compromiso. Sin embargo, en el caso de Águilas Doradas, ha llamado la atención una publicación que, incluso, despertó el malestar entre los hinchas 'azucareros'.\nA través de sus cuentas oficiales, el club publicó dos fotografías, entre las que se destaca una particular en la que se observa un dibujo, que habría sido realizado a través de la inteligencia artificial, donde hay un hombre con indumentaria de color dorado fumigando lo que sería el estadio del Deportivo Cali.\nEn la imagen también hay varios zancudos, que serían la razón de ser para esta fumigación a la que se hace referencia. Todo esto, aludiendo que en la zona donde se encuentra ubicado el recinto deportivo, hay este tipo de insectos.\n“Próximo partido frente a Deportivo Cali. Casi listos para nuestro viaje a Cali y enfrentar al ‘Azucarero’ por la fecha 13 de la LigaBetPlay ¡Vamos Águilas Doradas, carajoooo!”, fue el mensaje que acompañó la fotografía.\nDe inmediato, las reacciones, mayoritariamente de los hinchas 'verdiblancos' que no dudaron en expresar su molestia. “Su mayor logro fue llegar a una final de Copa Colombia… y perderla contra Deportivo Cali”, “técnicamente Águilas está descendido para el 2026 y con esas payasadas”, son algunos de los mensajes que se leen en la publicación que en X, ya cuenta con más de 300 respuestas.\nAficionados de otros equipos también se unieron al debate y principalmente, realizaron burlas por lo ocurrido.\n— Águilas Doradas (@AguilasDoradas)\n[#EquipoProfesional]| Próximo partido frente a[@AsoDeporCali]⚔️\nCasi listos para nuestro viaje a Cali y enfrentar al 'Azucarero' por la fecha #13 de la[#LigaBetplay]🦅💛👀\n¡Vamos Águilas Doradas, carajoooo! ⚽[#UnaPasiónDoradoDeCorazón][pic.twitter.com/SR1ikxztQl][April 9, 2025]",

El evento se realizará el próximo 14 de mayo.\nActualmente, la USF de Puentesiño funciona en modalidad simplificada, con atención hasta las 15:00 horas de lunes a viernes, lo que resulta insuficiente para las necesidades del distrito. Los fines de semana atienden un médico y una enfermera, pero financiados por la Municipalidad local.\nLea también: “¡No tenemos guantes! ¡Estoy podrida!”, el reclamo de una mujer a la ministra de Salud\nDesde hace varios años que la comunidad viene solicitando al Ministerio de Salud Pública y Bienestar Social (MSPyBS) la transformación del puesto en una USF más compleja, pero hasta el momento no ha sido incluida ni siquiera en los proyectos del ente.\n“Queremos construir una Sala de Urgencias con lo recaudado. No podemos seguir esperando mientras nuestra gente necesita atención”, expresó la intendenta Laude Morel, quien impulsa esta iniciativa junto con otras autoridades y vecinos del lugar.\nLa jefa comunal pidió también a la Gobernadora, la doctora Liz Meza, su intermediación con las autoridades nacionales en la búsqueda de una respuesta al pedido.",

    "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) – The Czech-led initiative to buy ammunition for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion has raised enough so far to purchase a first batch of 300,000 artillery shells, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on X social media platform on Friday.\n“Our goal is to deliver much more!” he said. “Our work and our help to Ukraine do not end here. We keep seeking partners so that we can continue to support Ukraine in its brave fight against the Russian aggressor.”\nCzech President Petr Pavel had said on Thursday the initiative had collected the amount needed for acquiring 800,000 ammunition pieces that had earlier been found and were available from unspecified countries outside Europe.\nA government adviser was quoted as saying in Czech media on Thursday evening, after Pavel had spoken of secured financing, that the full purchase was still not covered and there was no target amount in the initiative.\nPavel had last month said 500,000 rounds of 155-calibre ammunition and 300,000 rounds of 122-calibre ammunition were available and could be delivered with secured funding.\nSeveral European Union members and countries outside the bloc have made pledges to the ammunition drive for Ukraine, as fighting against Russia’s full-scale invasion hits a third year.\nIt comes as the EU will miss a year-old target to deliver one million ammunition rounds to Ukraine this month and as U.S. military aid, which has been the backbone of international support for Kyiv, has stalled.\nNorway said on Thursday it would donate up to 1.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($153 million) for the Czech plan. That followed pledges by Germany and France this week.\nPavel said on Thursday that 18 countries had joined the initiative.\n(Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Mark Potter and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",
