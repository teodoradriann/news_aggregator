    "text": "13/09/2024 - 8:59\nFuncionários da Boeing na região de Seattle, noroeste dos Estados Unidos, votaram em massa a favor de uma greve nesta sexta-feira (13) e rejeitaram o novo acordo da gigante da aviação, que se declarou “comprometida” com as negociações apesar de sua difícil situação financeira.\nO acordo foi rejeitado com 94,6% dos votos e a greve aprovada com 96%, disse Jon Holden, presidente do sindicato ‘International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751’.\n“Nossos membros falaram claramente esta noite”, disse o líder deste sindicato que representa mais de 30 mil trabalhadores da fabricante aeronáutica nesta região.\n“Começaremos a greve à meia-noite”, disse ele.\n– “Seguimos comprometidos” –\nO protesto afetará duas grandes montadoras no estreito de Puget Sound e paralisará a produção dos aviões 737, 777 e 767, cujas entregas já estão atrasadas.\nIsto representa um problema adicional à fabricante que recebe a maior parte do pagamento (cerca de 60%) quando a aeronave é entregue.\nApesar da votação esmagadora a favor da greve, o grupo Boeing afirmou em um comunicado que está “comprometido” com as negociações.\n“Continuamos empenhados em restabelecer nossa relação com nossos colaboradores e com o sindicato e estamos prontos para voltar à mesa de negociações para chegar a um novo acordo”, afirmou a empresa.\nSegundo analistas da TD Cowen, uma greve de 50 dias privaria a Boeing de entre 3 bilhões e 3,5 bilhões de dólares (16,9 a 19,79 bilhões de reais) em liquidez e teria um impacto de 5,5 bilhões de dólares (31,10 bilhões de reais) nas receitas.\nA proposta inicial previa um aumento salarial de 25% ao longo de quatro anos e a promessa de investimentos nesta região.\nPrevia também a construção da próxima aeronave, anunciada para 2035, na região de Seattle, berço histórico da fabricante, que deverá garantir empregos para as próximas décadas.\n– Um aumento “ilusório” –\nPorém, os trabalhadores consideraram que o acordo não era tão generoso e apontaram, por exemplo, que o aumento de 25% era ilusório porque, ao mesmo tempo, cortava um bônus anual.\n“Estão falando de um aumento de 25% e esse não é o caso”, disse Paul Janousek, eletricista da fábrica em Everett que votou pela greve.\nJanousek, de 55 anos e há 13 anos na Boeing, estima que o aumento seria de 9% com a eliminação do bônus anual.\nA greve ocorre em um contexto delicado para a Boeing, cuja reputação foi manchada por vários incidentes de segurança aérea.\nA fabricante enfrenta uma situação econômica complicada após os acidentes de dois 737 MAX 8 em 2018 e 2019, que tiraram a vida a 346 pessoas, além de vários outros problemas.\n“Não é segredo que nosso negócio está passando por um momento difícil, em parte devido aos nossos próprios erros do passado. (…) Uma greve colocaria em risco a nossa recuperação”, alertou Kelly Ortberg, CEO da empresa desde agosto.",

    "title": "No garage, no driveway, no problem: itselectric is bringing curbside EV charging to the US",
    "text": "itselectric establishes best practices for curbside EV chargers. - Millions of drivers around the world live in dense urban neighborhoods where they have no driveways, and thus no possibility of installing a home EV charger. That’s a problem—and the pre-eminent solution is curbside charging. - Curbside charging is not the same as destination charging. To fit into the urban streetscape, a curbside charger needs to be compact, and it doesn’t need an attached cable to create clutter and tripping hazards. That’s why itselectric designed its own charger, with a detachable cable. - itselectric’s chargers get their power from host properties, behind the meter. This avoids the expense and delays involved in getting a utility interconnection—a major challenge for many public charging projects. Q&A with itselectric co-founder and CEO Nathan King. For the last few years, the EV industry has been agonizing over the problem of providing charging for urban drivers who depend on on-street parking, and have no possibility of installing chargers at their homes. EV journalists, including your favorite, have spilled much virtual ink over what once seemed an intractable issue that threatened to hobble the EV transition. Nowadays however, a visit to some of the world’s most electrified cities makes the solution plain: lots and lots of curbside public chargers. In Europe, Oslo, Amsterdam and London fit this description, as do several Chinese cities. The US is just starting to catch on to the potential of curbside charging, and this presents opportunities for North American operators to learn from what is and isn’t working in Europe. The field of public EV charging is divided into several categories—curbside charging is not the same as destination charging, workplace charging or highway fast charging. Successfully deploying curbside charging requires creative ways of thinking about the hardware, the business model, and the supply of electrical power, as Nathan King, co-founder and CEO of curbside pioneer itselectric, explained to Charged. Charged: I’m keen on curbside at the moment, because I just got back from London, where I saw lots of EVs, and lots of curbside chargers. Your company focuses on curbside charging, and you approach things differently from the typical charge point operator. For one thing, you use a behind-the-meter power connection for your chargers. Nathan King: That’s definitely one of the things we are doing differently. I would say most of the companies that are operating as curbside charging networks are based on a direct-to-utility connection. Also, in North America, we haven’t really seen a network operator come to the curbside charging space. Where you do see curbside charging in North America, it’s based on an OEM model where the companies are selling the chargers to a utility or to a municipality, which then owns and operates them. What we’re trying to do is to bring the network operator model to the US, but skip some of the permitting difficulty that you encounter when you’re trying to connect directly to a utility main. Charged: So the ChargePoints and the EVgos of the world aren’t doing curbside charging? Nathan King: Well, you will occasionally see a ChargePoint charger in the roadway. There’s actually a handful in the District of Columbia. But in that case, DC is procuring the chargers and installing them. New York City also has some chargers on the curbside. Those were made by a Canadian company called Flo, which sold the chargers to the city for them to operate. “In North America, we haven’t really seen a network operator come to the curbside charging space. The Level 2 charging industry really is based on an OEM model.” The Level 2 charging industry in North America really is based on an OEM model. Companies like ChargePoint and Blink build the chargers, and try to get them procured by cities. Then the cities or the utilities have to figure out how to own and operate those chargers. We take the logistics of doing the installations and operation away from cities and utilities, and we earn revenue from the chargers ourselves. So, we’re not actually selling chargers, we’re installing and operating them. This is how it’s being done in the EU and the UK. We’re trying to bring this owner/operator model to the US, and curbside is an area where that model is possible because there’s really high utilization potential. If you put a charger in, for example, a supermarket parking lot, you won’t expect 24/7 use of that charger because people are doing opportunity charging. Maybe they’re plugged in for one or two hours while shopping. For a Level 2 charger, that’s not a ton of power that’s being transferred over those couple of hours. But when you put a charger on the curbside, that charger can be used by people who live in that neighborhood and park their cars on the street overnight every day. So now you have 24/7 availability to hundreds or thousands of vehicles that park within walking distance of that charger, and you see high utilization. What is curbside charging, exactly? Charged: It may be a subtle distinction, but how would you define the difference between curbside charging and plain old public charging? Nathan King: The other term we sometimes use is right-of-way charging. The distinction is that our chargers in all cases are going to be installed on publicly owned property. Think about somebody’s sidewalk in front of their building. The city owns and manages the rights to that sidewalk and the parking spot that’s next to the sidewalk. However, property owners have certain rights and responsibilities for that frontage. You’ve got to shovel the snow in the winter, and you’ve got to pick up your trash. On the other hand, property owners can take advantage of their sidewalk frontage in various ways. In some cases, commercial properties install their own lighting. Here in the Northeast, people sometimes install electric snow melting systems underneath their sidewalks. Because you have that frontage, you can make improvements to it that are permitted by the city. So, there’s a bit of a gray area when it comes to property owners’ relationship to their sidewalks, and that lets us take out a permit from the city on behalf of the property owner to install an EV charger. We always have to have permission from the city to operate. But we’re also working with the property owner for them to supply the power. “Our chargers are installed on publicly owned property. Property owners earn revenue from providing EV charging to their community, but they don’t have to worry about managing the parking spots.” The other thing that’s interesting about this right-of-way charging model is that the parking space itself is managed by the city. One of the issues that we see in places like apartments, condos, workplace charging, is that the property owner becomes responsible for enforcing EV charging at that spot. For example, if you’re a supermarket and an ICE vehicle parks in front of that charger, do you tow the vehicle? Or do you just let it sit there and annoy your EV driver customers? There are other things as well, like determining pricing structure and overstay fees, that can add operational complexity for a private property owner. What we’re unlocking is a model where property owners are able to earn a little bit of revenue from providing EV charging to their community, but they don’t have to worry about managing the parking spots, since those parking spots are managed and maintained by the city. Our chargers are installed on publicly owned property. Property owners earn revenue from providing EV charging to their community, but they don’t have to worry about managing the parking spots. Charged: You offer a turnkey service. You procure the hardware, do the installation, and handle all the billing and maintenance. Do you do that in-house, or do you contract with other companies? Nathan King: We’re a fairly lean team in terms of our operations, and a lot of what we do is subcontracted out. Even larger companies like Tesla or Electrify America, they may have some electricians on staff, but by and large, the design and installation work is being done by subcontractors. We’re doing the same thing. The right charger for the right job Charged: Tell me about the charging station itself. Does somebody build those for you to your specifications? Nathan King: That’s right. We saw the need to have a dedicated curbside charging hardware in North America. In the EU, curbside charging is based on a bring-your-own-cable or a detachable cable model. We don’t have that in the US. Generally speaking, when you encounter a charger, it’s going to have a cable attached to it. The untethered cable makes a lot of sense for curbside for a couple of different reasons, and that’s why we invested in our own design. You can’t go and buy an untethered cable that works in the US right now. Charged: I’m surprised. Is there really not a single company that sells those in the US? Nathan King: We were surprised too. And right now, we are first and only. I’ll tick through the advantages. The first is that it presents a smaller, cleaner, compact design. We won an RFP in Boston, and part of the reason that we won is because of the design of the charger. Boston has very narrow streets. There’s not a lot of room on the sidewalk. Finding a piece of hardware that fits within the urban landscape and doesn’t take up too much space, that’s a very important consideration. The detachable cable allows you to do that. Once you add a cable, you then have to figure out how to manage it. What you might see in a parking garage is a little hook where you expect drivers to loop the charger, or a little receptacle for drivers to plug it back in. Sometimes people just mic drop the charger and it gets left on the ground. On curbside installations, you see cable management systems that keep the cable lifted up off the ground. This adds bulk and complexity, and it doesn’t always work. The other thing is the repair and replacement of the cable. On the West Coast, we see a lot of issues with copper theft. People think that there’s a lot of copper and that it’s easy to get out of these cords. And it’s actually really hard to replace those cables once they’re cut from the charger. You may have to recommission the charger. You can’t just replace the cable. You’ve got to do a series of tests to make sure the cable’s functioning properly. It’s expensive, and there’s also downtime while you’re waiting for the charger to be prepared. “Everything is shifting to the J3400 standard. We give the driver the cable that fits their charging inlet. Drivers don’t need an adapter, and we don’t need to replace the connectors.” With our system, the drivers keep their cables with them, so there’s less opportunity for people to vandalize the cable. Then if it does happen, we’re not rolling a truck, we’re not waiting for replacement parts to arrive—we just send that driver another cable. The third advantage is our flexibility in charging standards. Everything is shifting over to the J3400 (NACS) standard, but we still have around a million cars with the J1772 charging inlet, including cars that are being sold this year. We give the driver the charging cable that fits their charging inlet. Drivers don’t need an adapter, and we don’t need to worry about coming back to these chargers in two or three years and replacing them with an NACS connector. We’re future-proofed on this charging standard. Charged: What kind of plug is it where your cable plugs into the charger? Nathan King: The port on the charging post itself is a universal non-proprietary standard—it’s a J3068, the same standard that’s being used in the EU and the UK. We will be interoperable with the existing technology that’s currently functioning in the US, and we expect if anybody else develops a detachable cable charger in North America, then they’ll also use J3068. Just to make it clear, when you get a charging cable from itselectric, it’ll also work with other detachable-cable chargers. Charged: Who makes the chargers for you? Nathan King: It’s a company called [Gyre9](https://www.gyre9.com/), based in Connecticut. They have their own line of EV chargers that they manufacture and sell. They also do prototyping and product development, so they were really a great partner for us. We didn’t see any charger in the North American market that offered the right design to scale this up, so we designed our own charger. It’s completely Build America/Buy America-compliant. Who needs utilities? Charged: Another innovative thing you’re doing is sidestepping some of the hassle of dealing with utilities by doing a submeter thing. Can you really do an end run around the utility like that? Nathan King: The short answer is: typically, yes. Every utility has different arrangements for how they manage what they call a franchise. A utility has special permission to build underground lines and have them powered. Now, when we go into a new municipality, one of the first things we do as due diligence is to validate our plans with the utilities we’re working with. It’s a dialogue and it’s a process, but generally speaking, wherever we currently have deployment plans, we’ve spoken with the utility and gotten their buy-in for what we’re trying to do. There are different ways that we’re going to do it. In some cases, we may work with the utility to get a dedicated meter with our own account. We’re just putting a new meter next to the existing meter that goes to the house or the commercial property. We have a lot of homeowners right now that we’re talking to, but we’re also working with commercial properties, multifamily buildings. We’d love to further expand into institutional property owners like schools and universities. “Even with fairly low utilization, it’s anywhere from $800 to $1,000 a year that the property owner is receiving in passive income.” So, sometimes we will have a meter that is dedicated for the single charger, or maybe two chargers that we’re attaching to it. And sometimes we’ll just find spare capacity on the existing house panel and tap into that, and we work out a way to reimburse the property owner for the power we pull. As part of our hardware package, we have a revenue-grade submeter, as any publicly accessible Level 2 charger has, that tracks the power that we’re pulling. We always know how much power is going through our charger, and then we can reimburse the property owner for their utility bill. Sometimes one way has advantages over another, but in all cases, we’re handling the installation, the permits, and once the charger goes live, we track the power that we’re using, reimburse the property owner and also share some of the revenue. And even with fairly low utilization, it’s anywhere from $800 to $1,000 a year that the property owner is receiving in passive income. Charging for charging Charged: Can you tell me how the revenue breaks down? Nathan King: Probably about half the revenue will go back to the utility. The price for drivers depends on the city. For example, in Boston, the cost per kilowatt-hour is quite high, so that’ll be reflected in the price we’re expecting drivers to pay. In the Midwest and Detroit, the cost per kWh is much lower. When we think about our pricing model, we set a couple of benchmarks for ourselves. We always want to have a per-kilowatt-hour price that’s competitive compared to DC fast charging, and a cost per mile below the price of gas. The cost to install a Level 2 charger on a curbside is orders of magnitude less than installing a DC fast charger, so we don’t have that same capital investment that the DC fast charging companies have. Power is also less expensive because we’re not faced with demand charges. Charged: Give me a quick history of the company. Nathan King: We’re about three years old. My background is in what we call technical architecture—figuring out how to work with contractors, how to get permits from the city, how to get power connected to your buildings—which I enjoyed in some weird way. The city of New York was actually my client on two different projects. During the pandemic, my family decided we needed a car. We live in Brooklyn, and we don’t have a driveway, so our car would be parked on the street, but there was nowhere for me to conveniently charge it. That was true three years ago. It’s still true today. The closest place for me to charge was a private parking garage a mile away, and I would’ve had to pay for the parking, and the charging on top of that. It’s very expensive. So, we bought a gas car. And throughout 2020 I was thinking about this as a problem. There’s about 40 million vehicles in the US that park on city streets. If we are going to make this EV transition happen, how are we going to deal with this part of the market? The aha moment was looking out my window and thinking, Why couldn’t I just toss a cord out, connect it to my building and plug my car in? Then I thought, what if I could make money from other drivers paying me for charging? The thing that I had going for me was all this experience in permitting things with cities, dealing with contractors, and three years later, here I am. Charged: How many charging sites do you have up and running at the moment? Nathan King: We have three in Brooklyn and four in Detroit. We are looking to install another up to 200 chargers in seven cities over the next 12 months. Our [recent fundraising](https://chargedevs.com/newswire/itselectric-secures-6-5-million-in-seed-funding-will-bring-curbside-charging-to-7-us-cities-this-year/) is supporting that activity. We have a couple of other smaller cities that we are looking to deploy in, but in terms of major metropolitan areas, it’s Boston, Alexandria, Detroit, Jersey City and Los Angeles. We’re also looking at a pilot opportunity in San Francisco. Charged: It sounds like you’re on the verge of moving from the pilot stage into the scale-up phase. Nathan King: Yeah. Earlier this year we announced that we had secured UL certifications for the charger. That’s a very important step in providing public charging. And between the RFPs that we’ve won and the grant money that we’re getting, our investment is really allowing us to build up our team and start to get these chargers in the ground. The obligatory question Charged: One more question, which I ask everybody. Why is the reliability of public chargers so abysmal? Nathan King: Yeah, how do I not give you a 25-minute dissertation on this? I can call out design, but I think I’ve already talked about that enough, so I’ll call out the business model. Public Level 2 charging in the US is mostly a model in which property owners buy chargers from charger manufacturers and operate them themselves. But I think the right model for Level 2 charging is for the company that makes the charger to be the company that owns and operates it. You’re then incentivized to design a charger that’s built to last, because your revenue is not based on making the sale. It’s based on earning continuous revenue—and that revenue goes down as soon as that charger stops working. Cities and utilities are experimenting with curbside charging, but ultimately they don’t want to be managing networks of thousands of EV chargers. It’s not what they do. Somehow we need to create accountability for the company that builds the charger to make sure that that charger stays up and running.

    "text": "A major rescue operation has been launched after a tunnel collapsed in Los Angeles, with dozens of people inside it.\nMore than 30 construction workers were rescued in a dramatic late-night operation in Wilmington, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, on Wednesday night.\nThe collapse occurred deep underground during work on a $630 million taxpayer-funded sewage infrastructure project.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) deployed all of its Urban Search and Rescue teams to the scene around 8 p.m.\nEmergency crews raced to free the trapped workers beneath hundreds of feet of earth.\nAccording to officials, the collapse happened along the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel.\nThe tunnel is a seven-mile-long, 18-foot-diameter project commissioned by the LA County Sanitation District.\nNBC Los Angeles reported that 31 workers were eventually extracted from the tunnel in coordinated groups using a crane and a cage elevator system known as a “bird cage.”\nBy 9 p.m., all personnel had been accounted for.\nAmazingly, no injuries were reported.\nParamedics on site cleared each worker after evaluation.\nThe workers had reportedly managed to climb over a 12 to 15-foot mound of collapsed debris to reach a safer portion of the tunnel.\nFrom there, they navigated more than five miles underground to the only access point available, the construction shaft, where they were hoisted to the surface.\nFlatiron Dragados, the prime contractor on the $630.5 million tunneling project, confirmed on its website that the operation was taking place 450 feet below ground level.\nThe project is part of a larger wastewater management overhaul set to be completed by 2027.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the emergency responders, writing on X:\n“I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped.\n“Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately.\n“You are L.A.’s true heroes.”\nCalifornia Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis also weighed in:\n“Deeply grateful for the swift, courageous response by @LAFD and LA’s first responders who rescued all the workers trapped in the Wilmington tunnel collapse.\n“Over 100 personnel responded.\n“Your quick action saved lives. Thank you.”\nDespite the successful rescue , serious questions remain about the cause of the collapse.\nOfficials with the LA County Sanitation District say a full investigation is underway, but have not offered a timeline for when findings will be released.\nThe tunneling phase of the project was supposed to be completed this year.\nWhether this setback will delay the 2027 completion date remains to be seen.\nAs California continues pouring billions into massive infrastructure projects, critics are calling for greater oversight, especially after a near-tragedy that could have claimed dozens of lives.\nAccountability for contractors and local officials may soon become part of the broader conversation as investigations unfold.\nREAD MORE – California Councillor Dies Suddenly of Cardiac Arrest at 50",

    "title": "France Takes a Stand: Expelling a Tunisian Imam Over Hate Speech",
    "text": "In the heart of France, a recent governmental decision to expel a Tunisian imam has sparked a widespread conversation on the balance between freedom of speech and the protection against hate speech. This move, undeniably bold and not without its controversies, underscores France's unwavering commitment to uphold values of respect, tolerance, and the safeguarding of its citizens from extremist ideologies.\nThe Allegations at Hand\nAt the center of this storm is Mahjoub Mahjoubi, an imam whose sermons have drawn the ire of French authorities. Accused of delivering messages laced with intolerance and violence, Mahjoubi's rhetoric allegedly targeted two vulnerable groups: women and Jews. The accusations are grave, implicating him in the propagation of hate speech that incites hatred and discrimination. This action by the French government, swiftly expelling Mahjoubi back to Tunisia, is a testament to their stringent stance against any form of radicalism. The government's decision, as reported, came less than 12 hours after his arrest, a move that reflects France's robust immigration laws aimed specifically at combatting hate speech from foreign religious leaders.\nFrance's Balancing Act\nFrance's expulsion of Mahjoubi has reignited debates over the delicate balance between ensuring freedom of speech and protecting citizens from extremist and divisive ideologies. In a country that prides itself on its secular values and freedom of expression, the line between permissible speech and hate speech is constantly scrutinized and debated. This incident highlights the challenges faced by authorities in navigating these complex waters, striving to maintain this balance while ensuring that religious leaders do not misuse their platforms to disseminate hatred. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin's statement that France will not tolerate such behavior underscores the government's resolve in this matter, as detailed in a report by\nArab News.\nLooking Forward\nThe expulsion of Mahjoub Mahjoubi is not an isolated incident but part of a broader effort by French authorities to ensure that extremism finds no foothold within its borders. By taking such decisive action, France sends a clear message that hate speech, under the guise of religious freedom or otherwise, will not be tolerated. This incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle against extremism and the importance of vigilance in upholding the values of respect and tolerance. As France continues to navigate these challenges, the world watches closely, understanding the implications of such actions in the broader fight against hate speech and extremism.",

    "text": "Daniel Hartwich von RTL-Publikum abgestraft: „Wärst du mal beim Dschungelcamp geblieben“\nAm Montagabend feierte Daniel Hartwichs neue Quizshow „Die perfekte Reihe“ Premiere. Die RTL-Zuschauer fällen ein klares Urteil.\nKöln – Nach „Let’s Dance“, „Das Supertalent“ und „Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus“ versucht sich Daniel Hartwich (46) jetzt an einer neuen Quizshow. Am Montag (28. April) feierte „Die perfekte Reihe – Das Bilderquiz“ Premiere und ist von nun an montags um 20.15 Uhr bei RTL zu sehen. Der Auftakt konnte jedoch wenig überzeugen.\nDaniel Hartwich präsentiert neue Quizshow „Die perfekte Reihe“: RTL-Zuschauer sind enttäuscht\nBei „Die perfekte Reihe“ müssen die Kandidaten ihr Allgemeinwissen unter Beweis stellen. Wer die Bilder zwölfmal in die richtige Reihenfolge bringt, der gewinnt 200.000 Euro. Nach der ersten Folge, die um 21.15 Uhr direkt nach „Wer wird Millionär?“ startete, melden sich auf Instagram auch schon einige mit Reaktionen – und die fallen dürftig aus.\n„War langweilig, die Show nix für mich“ und „Etwas lahm … vllt sollten Teilnehmer gegeneinander spielen und auf Zeit … Aber vllt wird es ja noch“, schreiben einige User zu einem Beitrag, der die neue RTL-Sendung bewirbt. Ein weiterer merkt hinsichtlich Daniel Hartwich an: „Wärst mal besser beim Dschungelcamp geblieben.“ Ein anderer enttäuschter Zuschauer nimmt den Moderator jedoch in Schutz: „Liegt nicht an Daniel, aber das Format ist langweilig.“\n„Die perfekte Reihe“ mit Daniel Hartwich startet beim jungen RTL-Publikum schwach\nImmerhin die Neugier lockte die Zuschauer aber wohl vor die Bildschirme. „Die perfekte Reihe“ erreichte laut DWDL bei RTL im Schnitt 2,04 Millionen Zuschauer (Quote: 8,9 Prozent) – also mehr als gewöhnlich. Beim jüngeren Publikum hingegen enttäuschte die Show. Hier holte Daniel Hartwich nur 0,314 Millionen Zuschauer (Quote: 6,5 Prozent) – deutlich unter dem Durchschnitt des Senders.\nNach so vielen Jahren im Geschäft dürfte der RTL-Star Rückschläge jedoch gewohnt sein. So anders sah Daniel Hartwich zu Beginn seiner RTL-Karriere aus. Verwendete Quellen: Instagram; dwdl.de",

    "title": "Victor Wembanyama set to miss rest of season as Spurs star picks up worrying injury - The Mirror US",
    "text": "San Antonio Spurs superstar Victor Wembanyama is set to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 NBA season after suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right shoulder.\nThe Spurs said in a statement that the condition was discovered when Wembanyama returned to San Antonio after the All-Star Game, which took place in San Francisco last weekend. The injury is a scary one for NBA fans and front offices following Chris Bosh's heartbreaking premature retirement due to blood clots.\nDVT is a form of a blood clot and typically occurs when a player does a movement repeatedly, putting pressure on a vein from the muscles around it. The Spurs believe it is an isolated issue for Wembanyama and expect him to return to full health for the 2025-26 NBA season.\nThe Spurs released a statement which read: “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Victor Wembanyama has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. The condition was discovered when Wembanyama returned to San Antonio following the All-Star Game in San Francisco. Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season. The team will provide updates as appropriate.”\nWembanyama is the reigning Rookie of the Year and was named an All-Star for the first time in his exciting young career. Following a stellar rookie campaign, Wembanyama led France to the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nEntering his second season surrounded by remarkable hype, the Frenchman has averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a league-leading 3.8 blocks in 46 games for the Spurs, who boast a 23-29 record. His combination with Chris Paul and the rest of the young Spurs team was helping the franchise develop an exciting future. The Spurs also made a blockbuster trade for De'Aaron Fox to combine him with Wembanyama going forward.\nUnfortunately, Wembanyama will not be eligible for All-NBA, Defensive Player of the Year and other major award because the 21-year-old did not meet the 65-game minimum threshold rule for award eligibility implemented ahead of last season. Wembanyama was enjoying a banner sophomore season and would have likely secured his first Defensive Player of the Year award thanks to his incredible production on both ends.\nToronto Raptors forward Brandon Ingram suffered from deep vein thrombosis in his right arm in March 2019, and bounced back to win Most Improved Player the very next season. Wembanyama - and the Spurs - will be desperate to replicate Ingram's recovery amid a scary situation.\nThe Spurs, without Wembanyama, are next in action against the 26-28 Phoenix Suns on Thursday, Feb. 20.",

    "text": "VATICAN CITY (RNS) — Pope Francis visited the female penitentiary of Rebibbia in Rome on Thursday (March 28) to celebrate the Holy Thursday ritual of feet washing, continuing the pontiff’s tradition of visiting marginalized groups on the Thursday before Easter. It’s the first time a pope has washed the feet of a group made up solely of women. The penitentiary is among the largest in Europe and houses 360 women and one child. The inmates have looked forward to the pope’s arrival with excitement, according to prison chaplain Don Andrea Carosella. “For them it’s a symbol of great attention, a symbol that shows that the pope thinks about them and is close to them,” Carosella told the news agency of the Italian bishops, SIR. “They need the kind of support that brings hope, a sign, caring, a gesture by someone who can help them have faith and courage to go forward,” Carosella said. “I think the pope’s visit offers inspiration for finding strength, finding courage.” The pope said Mass outside, in a large tent where the women and employees of the penitentiary gathered. “Always, all of us, face small failures, big failures, it doesn’t matter, everyone has their own story,” he said, “but the Lord always waits for us with open arms, and he never tires of forgiving us.” Pope Francis has arrived at a women’s prison in Rome to celebrate Holy Thursday Mass with the Foot Washing Rite. There are 300 inmates at the facility; the director says the greatest trial the women face at the prison is “loneliness.” [pic.twitter.com/cnelgKPjMX] — Rich Raho (@RichRaho) [March 28, 2024] While the Vatican had stated that the pope might not perform the ritual himself due to pain in his legs, Francis washed the feet of the inmates while sitting in a wheelchair. The women were placed on elevated chairs to allow the pope to wash their feet without bending too much. The event took place in private with no access for the public. Pictures show women weeping with emotion during the ritual. They hailed from Italy, Ukraine, Russia, Peru, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Roma community, among others. The Catholic Mass in Coena Domini and the washing of the feet are inspired by Jesus’ last supper, when he washed the feet of his disciples. Twelve inmates acted as the apostles, but the other inmates also had a chance to see the pope. They prepared for the event by singing songs, doing catechesis with the prison chaplain and reflecting on the spiritual significance of the papal visit. All the women in the penitentiary were invited to meet the pope regardless of their prison sentence or background. Pope Francis started the practice of visiting marginalized groups on Holy Thursday instead of performing the ceremony in St. Peter’s Basilica immediately after his election in 2013. He has visited juvenile prisons and centers for people living with physical and mental disabilities and has washed and kissed the feet of migrants and refugees. In 2016, Pope Francis issued a liturgical reform allowing women to act as the apostles in the foot washing ritual. In 2015, the pope visited the Rebibbia women’s prison and washed the feet of several inmates, including some women. The pope has dedicated the prayer intention for the month of April to “the role of women,” asking that they “be recognized in every culture, and for the end of discrimination that they experience in different parts of the world.” On April 28, he will visit another women’s prison during a day trip to Venice, where the Vatican has set up a pavilion for the Venice Biennale contemporary art exhibit. “I would like to say thank you on behalf of all those who live in this place and suffer the privation of their freedom,” said the director of the penitentiary, Nadia Fontana, in her address to the pope. “Your presence here today is like a ray of sun for each of them, which warms the hearts and restores hope of being able to start again, even when it means starting from scratch.” Pope Francis gifted the women a painting of the Virgin Mary and Child. He also gifted a giant chocolate egg and a smaller one to Jairo Massimo, a 3-year-old boy who has been living in the penitentiary with his mother for the past nine months.",

    "text": "¿Cuáles son los secretos para llegar a los 100 años con vitalidad y salud? Esto dicen los expertos Análisis detallados revelaron las estrategias para aumentar las probabilidades de llegar a los 100 años con calidad de vida y plenitud. En la búsqueda de una vida prolongada y saludable, cada vez más personas buscan estrategias respaldadas por la ciencia que les permitan alcanzar la venerable edad de 100 años. Afortunadamente, la investigación en el campo de la salud y la gerontología ha arrojado luz sobre las acciones concretas que podrían contribuir significativamente a este objetivo. Hábitos saludables para aumentar la esperanza de vida Un estudio publicado en la revista científica \"The Lancet\" examinó los hábitos de vida de más de 500.000 adultos y encontró que aquellos que seguían cinco hábitos saludables tenían una esperanza de vida significativamente mayor. Estos hábitos incluían no fumar, mantener un índice de masa corporal (IMC) saludable, hacer ejercicio regularmente, consumir una dieta equilibrada y moderar el consumo de alcohol.

Siga estos 5 trucos para evitar las arrugas a temprana edad](https://www.noticiasrcn.com/salud/estos-son-los-pasos-que-debe-seguir-para-evitar-arrugas-469213) Según los investigadores, seguir estos hábitos podría aumentar la esperanza de vida en más de una década. Investigaciones revelaron los secretos para aumentar los años de vida El ejercicio regular ha sido identificado repetidamente como un factor clave para una vida larga y saludable. Un estudio longitudinal realizado por investigadores de la Universidad de Harvard encontró que las personas que participaban en al menos 30 minutos de actividad física moderada al día tenían un riesgo significativamente menor de mortalidad prematura en comparación con aquellas que eran físicamente inactivas. Además, el ejercicio regular se ha asociado con una reducción del riesgo de enfermedades cardiovasculares, diabetes tipo 2 y algunos tipos de cáncer. La dieta también juega un papel fundamental en la longevidad. Un metaanálisis publicado en la revista \"Circulation\" encontró que seguir un patrón de alimentación saludable, como la dieta mediterránea, estaba asociado con un riesgo reducido de enfermedades cardiovasculares y una mayor esperanza de vida. Este patrón de alimentación se caracteriza por un alto consumo de frutas, verduras, granos enteros, pescado y aceite de oliva, y un consumo moderado de vino tinto. La importancia de las relaciones sociales en la longevidad también ha sido ampliamente documentada. Un estudio de la Universidad Brigham Young descubrió que la falta de relaciones sociales puede ser tan perjudicial para la salud como fumar 15 cigarrillos al día. Mantener conexiones sociales sólidas se ha asociado con una mayor resistencia al estrés, una mejor salud mental y un menor riesgo de enfermedades crónicas. Además de estos factores, cuidar la salud mental y mantener una actitud positiva hacia la vida también pueden contribuir significativamente a una vida larga y saludable. La investigación ha demostrado que la práctica regular de técnicas de manejo del estrés, como la meditación y el mindfulness, puede reducir la inflamación en el cuerpo y mejorar la función inmunológica, lo que puede tener efectos beneficiosos en la longevidad.

Al seguir un estilo de vida saludable, que incluya ejercicio regular, una dieta equilibrada, relaciones sociales sólidas y cuidado de la salud mental, podemos aumentar significativamente nuestras posibilidades de vivir una vida larga y plena.
