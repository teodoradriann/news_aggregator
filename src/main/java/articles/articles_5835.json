    "text": "STEUBENVILLE, Ohio (Gray News/TMX) – A woman in Ohio claims her Stanley tumbler saved her from being hit by a stray bullet.\nA 22-year-old named Rachel posted about the Feb. 12 incident on TikTok, which has since gone viral.\nRachel told TMX she and her fiancé David were inside their home in the city of Steubenville when they heard gunshots outside.\nShe said they heard about seven or eight gunshots and then one “really loud bang” from a bullet that came through the wall of the house and ricocheted off her Stanley tumbler, which was sitting directly in front of her.\nAfter bouncing off the Stanley cup, the bullet changed direction and went through a bottle of perfume before landing on the kitchen floor, Rachel said.\nThe couple said they hid until police officers arrived.\nRachel’s video on TikTok documents the path of the bullet, showing the hole through her wall, the mark on her Stanley cup where the bullet bounced off, and the hole in her perfume bottle. The video also shows the bullet on her kitchen floor.\nWhile some TikTok users questioned the authenticity of the claims, Rachel posted a follow-up video showing police in her home, investigating the scene.\nGray News has reached out to Steubenville police for comment.\nHowever, some fellow Stanley fans were not surprised to hear that their favorite cup was indestructible, even against a bullet.\n“Who needs body armor? Just grab your Stanley,” one TikTok user wrote.\n“I’m convinced Stanleys are immortal,” another wrote.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved. TMX contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Alabama court decision panics Jews relying on IVF – The Forward",
    "text": "News Embryos ‘held hostage’: An Alabama court decision panics Jews relying on IVF The Alabama Supreme Court’s recent ruling equating an embryo with a child is panicking American Jews who wonder where they can safely pursue fertility treatment and whether they will lose control over their frozen embryos. Jewish groups that work to protect reproductive rights, and others that help Jews afford fertility treatments, have condemned the decision as both a violation of reproductive and religious rights. The ruling, they warn, has already had grave consequences for Jews and others in Alabama whose IVF clinics have shut down in response. But they are not yet sure of all the decision’s ramifications. “The scariest part is we’re supposed to be the experts to advise our clients,” said Elana Frank, founder and CEO of the Atlanta-based Jewish Fertility Foundation , which helps Jews afford fertility treatment. But “our attorneys and our doctors are freaking out.” IVF, which involves the insertion of an embryo into a patient’s uterus, is an expensive but often effective treatment for infertility. Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women , said her organization has received hundreds of calls and emails this week about the ruling. “People we know, people we don’t know, people’s parents — lots of people saying, ‘do I need to move my frozen embryos?’” IVF patients frequently wind up with more embryos than are actually implanted and often choose to freeze them for possible future pregnancies. Many now fear that discarding those embryos would be considered murder in Alabama — and elsewhere under some state laws. And they worry that other states will follow Alabama’s lead. The Alabama judge who wrote Friday’s decision, which legal experts say is likely to be appealed, rooted it in a school of Christian belief which holds that life begins at conception. He quoted extensively from the Bible, and in a concurring opinion the court’s chief justice wrote: “Human life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God.” Can you adopt an embryo? Jewish law and traditions take a different and more nuanced view. Frank offered a widespread belief among Jews: “Embryos are potential children.” The Jewish Fertility Foundation’s Birmingham, Alabama, office learned this week that both fertility programs it works with — the University of Alabama’s and Alabama Fertility Specialists — had paused all IVF treatment in response to the ruling. Now the foundation is scrambling to help many of its 50 Birmingham clients to transfer their care to Atlanta, home to another one of the foundation’s eight offices. Nearly 100 people across the country tuned into an Instagram Live session Wednesday night, hosted by the foundation, which featured an attorney specializing in family law to answer questions as best she could. “It feels like my embryos are being held hostage,” said one woman during the session. Others asked if they could move their embryos out of state, or whether donating an embryo was akin to an adoption. Katz said that while she is not expecting a slew of states to pass laws or hand down rulings similar to Alabama’s within the next few weeks, this election cycle is likely to bring more challenges for who want to get pregnant and those who don’t. After the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in 2022, which struck down the constitutional right to abortion, Katz said “the number one question we got from women across the country was ‘what do I do with my frozen embryos?’”",

As per the NewYork Post, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have bought one of 300 soon-to-be constructed residences at the 722-acre CostaTerra Golf and Ocean Club, an upscale development located approximately 81 miles south of Lisbon. It is reported that the couple spent more than $4.7 million on the purchase of this new property. But after they purchased, the couple now have a challenge in obtaining European Union citizenship. With the UK completely separate from the EU after Brexit, Harry and Meghan are required to apply for Portuguese citizenship, which includes a language assessment. Global Citizen Solutions, Portugal shared that the “Golden Visa” application process tests prospective candidates’ ability to use and understand everyday language, expressions, and basic phrases. The couple also faced struggles in learning a new language which seems to be a problem for the Suits alum, who can speak Spanish and French fluently, the same cannot be said for Harry, who has admitted to not knowing a second language. The Sussexes also have several choices available to them for obtaining Portuguese citizenship, including five years of continuous residency, having descendants from the nation, or making an investment of $540,000 in investment funds, scientific research, or local businesses.",

    "text": "Tennis\nFormer Miami Open champ Carlos Alcaraz understands the pressures on rising star Jack Draper\nCarlos Alcaraz — the “It Guy” of tennis, according to one journalist Wednesday at Hard Rock Stadium — won the Miami Open when he was just 18 years old in 2022, becoming the youngest champion in tournament history.\nNow, the modest-yet-fiery world No. 3 tennis star from Spain has a fellow young phenom who could challenge him at Hard Rock — a 23-year-old who defeated Alcaraz last week in a BNP Paribas Open semifinal.\nJack Draper, 23, of Great Britain, burst into the top 10 with the title at Indian Wells, California, and sits just four spots below Alcaraz at No. 7.\nThe two are on different sides of the week’s draw and could meet in the final. Both spoke Wednesday at the tournament as they prepared for their opening matches later this week.\n“The thing that makes his tennis really high right now, the level he plays, he’s solid on every point,’’ Alcaraz said of Draper. “[At] Indian Wells he was really, really solid with a lot of pace on the match with different kinds of shots. He can hit the forehand with a lot of topspin. The backhand is a little bit flat and he serves pretty well.\n“But for me, the most important thing is he grew up a lot physically. And for your mind, that’s really, really important because the confidence is even higher. At Indian Wells he played great tennis and mentally he’s strong enough to play at a high level the whole match. That makes him a really tough opponent.”\nDraper, a long and lanky lefty at 6-4 and 187 pounds, defeated Miami’s 11th-seeded Holger Rune of Denmark to win at Indian Wells. He’s on a six-match winning streak that included fourth-ranked Taylor Fritz, this week’s No. 3 seed.\n“It definitely gives me more confidence and more inner belief than I had before,’’ said Draper, who is now coached by fellow Brit and former No. 1 Andy Murray and has battled multiple injuries in his career, including one earlier this year to his hip. “It feels amazing to win a Masters 1000. It feels amazing to beat the players I did. That’s the other thing, beating six players back-to-back-to back — top, top players.\n“It’s really important for me to do that. But at the same time I feel like I’ve been building towards this. I feel like I’ve been improving all the time… I feel great. I don’t feel crazy different. I just keep up the hard work, keep on doing what I’m doing and hopefully it keeps on coming together for me.”\nAlcaraz, the former No. 1 who has 17 career victories and more than $39 million in prize money, grinned when he was told he’s one of the main reasons fans pack his matches.\n“I’m just really happy to be one of those players who are making people get to the tennis, starting to watch tennis,’’ Alcaraz said. “That’s what I’m trying to do — have a style or type of tennis that people like. I always say, ‘Yeah, I’m playing for myself, for my people,’ but I’m playing also to entertain the people. That’s what I’m trying for every time and just really happy being a player who contributes for tennis and the future of tennis.”\nAdded Alcaraz: “I’m not going to say the people are just coming here to the tournament to watch my tennis, because every time I’m playing against an opponent, I see a lot of fans cheering for the other guy. Right now we have a lot of players who are fun to watch, which is great.”\nAmericans galore\nWorld No 13 Tommy Paul, the No. 12 seed at the Miami Open, is one of 17 American men in the main draw, the most since 19 in 1996.\nPaul, 27, is not only an American, he’s a South Floridian. He moved to Boca Raton when he was 14, though he grew up playing on the clay courts of Greensville, North Carolina.\nPaul, who meets 80th-ranked Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan in Paul’s opening match Friday, was asked about the influx of American men this year.\n“For me, any time I see a lot of Americans in a draw, I’m happy,” Paul said Wednesday. “It’s cool because a lot of them are training down here in South Florida, so I practice with a ton of them. I’m always rooting for all the Americans.”\nThe last American man to win the Miami Open was John Isner in 2018. This year, the field includes four Americans among the top 16 seeds. One of them is Fritz, the top American in the tournament and a Miami resident.\n“It’s so nice to be able to sleep in my own bed, drive my car to the tournament,’’ Fritz said. “I live in midtown Miami, which is easy access to Boca and Delray, so I can practice with a lot of guys up there. I moved here temporarily in 2021 to see if I’d like it, and I loved it.’’\nPaul, who lost to now-eighth-ranked (and Miami Open No. 7 seed) Daniil Medvedev in straight sets last week in the Round of 16 at the BNP Paribas Open, said there aren’t “many guys on tour that have [ATP Masters 1000] matches within an hour of their house.’’\n“I get to sleep in my own bed and compete at one of the biggest tournaments in the world. That’s special.”\nMarquee matches\nOn Thursday, top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus will begin play against Viktoriya Tomova of Bulgaria on Stadium Court in the third Stadium match of the day. Coco Gauff of Delray Beach will face 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin not before 1 p.m. on Stadium Court in the match before Sabalenka’s.\nAt night, defending women’s champion Danielle Collins plays the second match on Stadium Court.",
