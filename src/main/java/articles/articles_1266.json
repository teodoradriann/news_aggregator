    "title": "Discovering Yourself with Angelina Fabian: A Peek into the Authorities of the Human Design System",
    "text": "It’s just how we’re wired; we all feel and react differently simply because we are all unique in our genetic blueprint.\nThis beautiful complexity of human nature led me to\nAngelina Fabian`s work with the Human Design System(HDS). She brings a new way of looking at quirks and characteristics and understanding them and ourselves better.\nCentral to this system are the “Authorities,” each offering a unique lens to view our decision-making processes. They are the inner tools that guide individuals in making choices that are correct for them. Each person has a unique design, and by understanding their specific inner Authority, they can navigate life more authentically and in alignment with their true nature.\nThere are several types of Authorities in HDS, and each is determined by the specific centers that are defined in an individual’s body-graph. These Authorities include:\nSolar Plexus Authority: Decisions are best made when they tap into their emotional waves and wait for clarity over time. Angelina suggests tuning into our emotional waves, finding a bit of calm amidst the storm. It’s like waiting for the dust to settle before making a move.\nSacral Authority: This is for Generators and Manifesting Generators. It’s about listening to the gut response—a visceral “uh-huh” or “uh-uh” that arises spontaneously. It’s that instinct that screams, “Go for it!” or “Stay away!”\nSplenic Authority: This authority is intuitive and operates in the present moment. It offers fast, intuitive advice. Angelina often talks about this gentle, almost whisper-like voice of intuition. It’s about trusting that first instinct.\nEgo Projected Authority: Decisions for Projectors are best made when they consider what’s in their best interest, what they want, or what they have willpower for. Their ego/willpower will guide them in making the correct decision in alignment with their true self. This authority encourages us to trust and follow that inner guidance.\nSelf/ G Authority: Guided by their own sense of identity and direction, these individuals can trust their own trajectory in life. They have an inner compass that guides them in the correct direction. Angelina hints that being in the right environment can make the difference.\nHeart/Ego Manifested Authority: This is for Manifestors with a defined heart center. They are meant to inform others before initiating action. It’s about using the power of their will, ego, and clear communication to initiate a decision in their lives. This process sets the stage for smoother interactions and ensures that their actions have a more significant impact on the world around them.\nMental Authority: Picture you’re chatting with a close friend, and as you talk, things just start making sense. That’s how the power of reflection works. It’s not about getting advice but about hearing your thoughts out loud and gaining clarity.\nLunar Authority: Only Reflectors can have this authority. They benefit from waiting a full 28-day lunar cycle before making major decisions, allowing them to sample and reflect upon the energies around them. Angelina often brings up the moon’s influence, especially for those who are born with this authority. It’s about syncing with the moon’s phases, letting them guide your choices.\nThe Human Design System, as\nAngelina Fabian showcases, is like a compass for the soul. It’s not about following a strict path but discovering the path that’s right for YOU.\nHaving a tool to understand ourselves better is priceless. While Angelina might be a guiding star in this realm, the HDS empowers each of us to find our own way.

    "text": "Cálculo de compensações por acidente de trabalho segue referenciais de 1990. Provedora de Justiça pede atualização dos indicadores. E muitos funcionários públicos só conseguem aceder à indemnização depois da reforma\nAs indemnizações devidas a trabalhadores vítimas de acidente de trabalho em Portugal estão a ser pagas com base em referenciais de há 30 anos, penalizando os profissionais. O alerta vem da provedora de Justiça, Maria Lúcia Amaral, que emitiu recentemente uma recomendação para que fossem atualizadas as fórmulas de cálculo que ainda se baseiam na esperança média de vida apurada com os dados demográficos de 1990, abaixo da atual. E recomenda ainda que se reveja a taxa de juro presumida utilizada no cálculo, 5,25%, muito acima do que hoje se pratica. Advogados ouvidos pelo Expresso defendem a necessidade de adotar critérios atuais e ajustados, sujeitos a atualização contínua e apontam outros problemas ao regime em vigor. É o caso dos funcionários públicos, já que muitos só podem receber a compensação por danos decorrentes de acidente de trabalho depois da reforma.\nTem dúvidas, sugestões ou críticas?

    "title": "Parenting seasons and cherishing the moment: Here's why it's bulls***.",
    "text": "I have just emerged from a particularly challenging few months of parenting. The transition to daycare and back to work after maternity leave , with a barely one-year-old.\nIt was brutal. My son spent two months either crying on drop-off, or crying from the up-teenth sickness he'd contracted from the place I was dropping him off to.\nI spent my days feeling like a shit parent, and a shit worker. I'd scroll through the daycare app feeling the guilt surge through my body when every photo was of a grim little dude either being held by an educator (because he wouldn't let them put him down), or sadly sitting amongst other kids as they participated in paint/play/circle-time.\nI am on the other side now. My son is happy and thriving at daycare, and is sick on a much less disruptive basis. Meanwhile, I finally feel like I can concentrate while I am at work and get into the groove of my new reality.\nMy friend, Emma, has just entered a different parenting pain-point. The transition to big school and 9-3pm hours , which clash horrifically with most regular 9-5pm working hours.\nListen to the seven types of school parents. Post continues after podcast.\nWhile my struggle was relatively short-lived, Emma is staring down the barrel of years of compromise, confusion and frustration as she tries to navigate a system that we know doesn't work.\nBut don't worry. What I endured, and what Emma is enduring are just 'seasons.' A difficult season of parenting that will eventually pass, or work itself out.\nGemma Bath News Editor August 30, 2024\nShare via facebook\nShare via twitter\nShare via whatsapp\nSMS Share via SMS\nShare via e-mail 2 Comments Listen Now\n00:00\nLittle Love Stories: Two Siblings, One Kidney & The Ultimate Act of Sisterhood This Glorious Mess ADVERTISEMENT Well, that's what academia, the media and advertising has told us. That's how those around us have dismissed our very real, very distressing challenges.\nRecently in a newsletter, author Claire Zulkey wrote , \"sometimes when you express something witchy on social media (or even real life), other people come back with the promise/threat that you’re going to miss this some day.\"\nShe was talking about \"cherishing each moment of young parenthood fully and with an open heart and zero negative feelings.\" Like that would somehow innoculate you from later feeling any sense of grief for that time once your kid is older.\nIt got me thinking about seasons. It's the same bulls*** as this 'idea' that you need to cherish every moment, no matter how hard. The pressure that puts on parents! The unrealistic expectation! The guilt when you are not in fact *cherishing* a particularly hard day/week/month.\nThose two months I mentioned above, were some of the hardest months I have experienced as a parent. The upheaval, the emotions, the guilt, the sickness - I shed more tears during that time than I care to count.\nCalling it a 'season' undermines what I experienced. Telling me to 'cherish it' just makes me feel s*** about myself. It makes my struggle sound trivial, and like my reaction to that experience was perhaps a bit much. A bit over the top.\nADVERTISEMENT As for Emma's dilemma. Traditional 9am to 3pm school hours come from a time which assumes women do not work. In 2024, it's much more common to have two working parents (either out of desire, monetary reasons or both), and yet families are still trying to juggle school hours amongst working hours that don't match.\nThat's not a 'season' to endure, that's a fundamental problem that we need to fix as a society.\nHow is Emma supposed to *cherish* the logistics of seven years of primary schooling that force either her, or her husband, to drastically change their career?\nLooking back at my so far short journey into the world of parenthood, there have been many moments where I've felt guilty for not enjoying a phase more. I particularly resent the fact that sleep struggles for young babies are commonly seen as just a 'season' of parenting. Something you just need to endure.\n I cherish most of the moments with my son, but there are some I wouldn't relive if you paid me.\nADVERTISEMENT Sleep deprivation is a torture technique. A baby that isn't sleeping is a nightmare. They're miserable, you're miserable and every facet of life is affected. We can't keep letting new parents flounder their way through this experience and just dismiss it as a 'season,' while demonising any intervention said parents are considering to save their sanity.\nOften parents in this pain-trough are also told, \"but they're only little for such a short time, enjoy the extra cuddles and contact naps.\" That might be true, but that doesn't negate the whole not sleeping thing. And it doesn't just cancel out a tired, overwhelmed parent's feelings on the matter.\nSo why does this keep happening?\nSchool holidays going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and working-parents having to work out a jumble of childcare options because they don't have enough annual leave days to stay home with them?\nThat's a problem. Not a season.\nBringing a new baby home and wrangling with the emotions and transition of introducing your toddler to them, while also trying to grapple with the sudden doubling of your responsibilities?\nADVERTISEMENT That's a challenge. Not a season.\nRecently I wrote a story about regretful parents. I am not a regretful parent, but reading through the anonymous stories of those who are, I noticed a common thread. These parents felt like they had been lied to about the realities of what parenthood was. They felt cheated and tricked; they knew it wasn't going to be easy, but the realities of those challenges hadn't been properly explained to them before they jumped in.\nWatch: A regretful parent shares their thoughts. Post continues.\nVideo via TikTok It's phrases like, 'parenting seasons,' that contribute to that. It's telling parents to \"cherish every moment\" that makes them stop talking about how they actually feel.\nParenting is a wonderful, rewarding and beautiful experience. But it's also messy, and complicated and really challenging. We need to stop glossing over the nuances of those challenges.\nSome challenges aren't worth cherishing, and that's ok.\nF eature image: Getty.\nDo you have any Streaming Video Services in your household? e.g. Netflix, Stan, etc. We want to hear from you!

    "text": "KINGSTON – Six different Weymouth players found the scoresheet to help the Wildcats earn a 7-4 victory over Duxbury to secure the Ico Cup Championship.\nThe scoring outburst came after a semi-final matchup against Nauset Wednesday that was light with scoring as the Wildcats advanced in a shootout after skating to a 1-1 tie. Wildcats coach Patrick Kennedy said the strength of the competition was significant in the tournament and the way his team handled it showed its mental fortitude.\n“It was a good tournament with good, competitive teams and no easy games,” Kennedy said. “Definitely proud of the kids, they rallied together, and they did it as a team.”\nIt did not take long for the game’s first goal as Weymouth’s Jake Buccigross found the back of the net within the first 40 seconds of the contest. That initial lead would be short lived after Duxbury’s David Pittenger scored via an off angle shot to even the score.\nThe teams would trade goals once again early in the first, with Michael Curry using a quick wrist shot to put Weymouth up again before Will Atallah capitalized on a shot from the top of the circle. That score would hold for much of the opening frame before a terrific tip from Johnny Bell put the Wildcats back in the lead. Bell said he noticed a hole towards the middle of the zone and his teammates recognized it.\n“They didn’t cover me out of the corner,” Bell said. “Our defenseman shot it, I deflected it and it went bar down.\nThe scoring continued in the second when Alex Stockton won a net front battle to make the Weymouth lead 4-2. Duxbury’s Michael Hussey drew back within one a moment later after sniping it from near the blue line and much of the period went by with that 4-3 score.\nHowever, Weymouth struck once again near the end of the period when Aaron Howard scored off a bullet from the blue line on the power play. This rounded out the second period of scoring with Weymouth ahead 5-3.\nThe Wildcats would quickly score in the third, this one from Johnny Haley, but a Cole Martin tally brought Duxbury back within two. With the Dragons net empty, the team sustained significant pressure, but Weymouth goalie Grady Salfity locked it down. He credited the defense with keeping the puck away from high pressure areas.\n“My defense is really good at keeping it out of the square,” Salfity said. “They get sticks in lanes and keep it to the outside. They are unreal.”\nBell would add an empty netter to seal the deal on a tournament that Kennedy hopes the Wildcats continue to compete in.\n“We played the spoiler a little bit,” Kennedy said. “They knew there was something on the line, winning a tournament that we weren’t the host of and getting the invite back next year.”",

    "text": "\"Без задержек и баз\": правительство кардинально изменило доставку учебников в школы\nПравительство решило ускорить доставку учебников в школы. Теперь это будут делать сами издательства - напрямую, без посредников.\nОб этом рассказывает РБК-Украина со ссылкой на Правительственный портал.\nКабмин 11 июня принял новые правила, которые меняют логистику учебных материалов. С 2025 года учебники и пособия (кроме электронных и тех, что для детей с ООП) будут доставлять непосредственно со складов издательств в учебные заведения.\nЧто меняется\nРанее доставка происходила через областные книжные базы - этот этап часто вызывал задержки. Теперь он исключен, а издательства сами будут отвечать за доставку в школы.\nЧтобы контролировать процесс, в системе АИКОМ появится функция электронной накладной. Благодаря ей можно будет проследить факт доставки книг в каждое учебное заведение. Это техническое новшество реализовали при поддержке Всемирного банка.\nВсе учебники должны быть доставлены в школы не позднее чем через месяц после печати. Доставка будет оплачиваться из госбюджета.\nОтветственные лица в школах пройдут обучение по пользованию новым функционалом. Дату и формат обучения сообщат позже.\nДля детей с особыми образовательными потребностями останется старая схема - через областные базы.\nЧто еще изменило правительство\nТакже утверждена формула для расчета стоимости интерактивного е-приложения к учебнику. В нее включены:\n- разработка ПО;\n- гонорары авторам;\n- техническую поддержку;\n- рентабельность;\n- другие сопутствующие расходы.\nЭти изменения внесены в соответствующий Порядок использования бюджетных средств в сфере образования.\nНапомним, правительство не планирует возвращать все школы и университеты к офлайн-обучению с сентября 2025 года - там, где опасно, ученики и студенты продолжат обучение онлайн. Формат будет зависеть от ситуации в регионе: в безопасных - очно или смешанно, в прифронтовых - дистанционно.\nТакже РБК-Украина рассказывало, что с сентября 2025 года украинские школы смогут внедрять в образовательный процесс \"Уроки энергоэффективности\". Учеников будут учить рационально использовать энергию. Для учителей уже разрабатывают учебные материалы и методические советы. К программе могут присоединиться педагоги 4-11 классов.\nСрочные и важные сообщения о войне России против Украины читайте на канале РБК-Украина в Telegram.",

    "text": "Ni siquiera llevamos una semana del nuevo año y Kendall Jenner ya ha tenido un comienzo de vestimenta sexy. Después de comenzar 2024 con un vestido transparente que era más que sexy y es nuestra nueva obsesión de vestido de playa durante vacaciones en Barbados, la supermodelo estrenó su primer bikini del año, y es ardiente en más de un sentido.\nKendall Jenner en Microbikini naranja\nEl jueves, Jenner publicó una nueva foto de su escapada tropical en Instagram, y en las instantáneas, llevaba una bikini micro naranja de la firma Deparel que incluía una blusa sin mangas diminuta y una tanga a juego con cordones. Ambas piezas presentaban un estampado blanco ondulado con volantes que era un guiño al océano de fondo, mientras que su tono naranja fuego combinaba con la puesta de sol detrás de ella. Kendall anduvo descalza y se complementó con gruesos aretes de oro y un anillo de diamantes gigante en su dedo índice.\nLa elección de la belleza de Kendall fue mínimo, ya que llevaba poco o nada de maquillaje y recogió su cabello castaño oscuro en una elegante cola de caballo con una raya central.\nJunto a Kendall para sus vacaciones en la playa estaban Hailey y Justin Bieber, así como su exnovio Bad Bunny.\nGalería de imágenes Accedé a los beneficios para suscriptores Contenidos exclusivos Sorteos Descuentos en publicaciones Participación en los eventos organizados por Editorial Perfil.
