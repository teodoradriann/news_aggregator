    "text": "NBA star Gilgeous-Alexander wins CP male athlete of year, narrowly edging Oilers captain McDavid\n 8:29 am.\nLast Updated December 28, 2023 11:01 am.\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander took 2023 by storm, blossoming into a superstar on both the NBA and international stages.\nThe basketball star from Hamilton has added another feather to his cap, coming out on top of an impressive field to be named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\nGilgeous-Alexander broke out in 2022-23 with the NBA’s Oklahoma City Thunder, who exceeded expectations by almost squeezing into the playoffs. This season, with Gilgeous-Alexander leading the way, the Thunder are currently second in a competitive Western Conference.\nHe also led Canada to its first-ever FIBA World Cup medal in September, earning bronze with a win over the United States. Canada’s performance at the tournament earned it its first Olympic berth since 2000.\n“Representing Hamilton and helping grow the game of basketball in Canada is one of the true joys of playing in the NBA, and I greatly appreciate the recognition from The Canadian Press with this award,” he said in a statement.\n“One thing I take great pride in is my work ethic, and with the Thunder I try to bring my best every single day to make my home country proud.”\nThe 25-year-old finished with 12 votes in a survey of sports journalists and broadcasters across the country, placing just ahead of Edmonton Oilers captain and NHL superstar Connor McDavid (11). Golfer Nick Taylor, who won the Canadian Open this year, and decathlon world champion Pierce LePage were tied for third (10).\n“A tough call with so many deserving candidates, but we haven’t seen this kind of NBA excellence from a Canadian since Steve Nash,” said Postmedia sports columnist Tim Baines. “Even brighter days ahead.”\nThe 2022-23 season was Gilgeous-Alexander’s fifth in the NBA. He finished fourth in the league in scoring (31.4) playing 68 games, his first time competing in more than 56 since his sophomore year.\nThe Thunder finished 10th in the West and made it to the play-in tournament, but fell short of the playoffs after losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, Gilgeous-Alexander made his first all-star team – the fourth Canadian to do so – and first team all-NBA for his efforts, becoming the second Canadian to receive all-NBA honours alongside Nash.\nGilgeous-Alexander carried the momentum of his NBA play into the summer with the Canadian team. He averaged 24.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists, and 1.6 steals in eight games at the FIBA World Cup to be named a tournament all-star. He will be looking to lead Canada to the podium at the 2024 Paris Games.\n“Playing for Team Canada is an honour, and being a part of the squad that won bronze at the World Cup is a career highlight, but I can’t wait to put the work in to aim for greater heights in Paris in 2024,” Gilgeous-Alexander said.\nHis run included a 31-point, 12-assist performance in the overtime win over the Americans in the bronze-medal game.\n“Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, I think very clearly could have easily been the MVP of that tournament,” said Canada men’s general manager Rowan Barrett.\nGilgeous-Alexander has upped the ante in 2023-24, and has brought the upstart Thunder along with him.\nOklahoma City has exceeded expectations once again, boasting a 19-9 record.\nMeanwhile, Gilgeous-Alexander, who was named the winner of the 2023 Northern Star Award as top Canadian athlete earlier this month, is third in the NBA at 31.1 points per contest and leads the league in steals at 2.8 a night. He’s the NBA’s lone player averaging two or more steals and averages close to one block per game (0.8) as a six-foot-six point guard.\n“Amazing. Amazing,” Denver Nuggets guard and fellow Canadian Jamal Murray said. “Playing really well – on both ends of the floor, as well, which I think most people talk about (offence).\n“He’s just always aggressive, he’s always a threat out there every time you guard him.”",

    "text": "CNR occupato a Roma, 4000 contratti in scadenza: “Il precariato ci mortifica e penalizza la ricerca”\n[Gabriel Bernard](https://www.fanpage.it/roma/author/gabrielbernard/)\nDieci anni di esperienza professionale alle spalle prima di entrare al Consiglio Nazionale di Ricerca come tecnologa. Diciassette anni di iscrizione all'albo degli ingegneri. Sei anni di assegno di ricerca e un contratto a tempo determinato che scadrà tra poco più di un mese. La battaglia del CNR occupato, per la terza volta in pochi anni, è riassunta tutta lì. Nel racconto di Valentina Tomassoni, ricercatrice d'esperienza. \"Il 17 gennaio 2025 scado\", dice. E il verbo non è scelto a caso. Perché lei si sente così, \"a scadenza. Senza alcuna sicurezza. So bene che il mio contratto non verrà rinnovato. Ed è frustrante. Mi sento male, mi sento maltrattata\". Valentina, come centinaia di lavoratori precari della ricerca, tecnologi e assegnisti, l'altro ieri si è barricata nell'aula magna del Centro in piazzale Aldo Moro. Al centro un grande striscione: \"Basta precariato. Reclutamento straordinario subito\". Hanno partecipato alla [manifestazione di venerdì](https://www.fanpage.it/politica/sciopero-generale-oggi-29-novembre-per-trasporti-scuola-e-non-solo-chi-si-ferma-e-con-quali-orari/) nelle strade della Capitale: sciopero generale contro la legge di bilancio del governo.\nRosa Ruscitti della Flc Cgil Roma lo spiega bene: \"Il governo sta discutendo sulla riduzione di dieci euro del canone Rai. Discutano di cose serie, finanzino la ricerca. Staremo qui, sino a che le cose non cambieranno\". E aggiunge: \"Ci siamo uniti da tutta Italia per confrontarci sulla situazione\".\nIl precariato, spiegano, non danneggia solo le persone, ma anche la ricerca. E al Centro Nazionale di ricerca, i numeri tratteggiano un quadro molto chiaro: 4000 precari. \"Ogni giorno – racconta Rossella Lucà, Coordinatrice Nazionale del CNR per Uilrua – sono nei laboratori a portare avanti progetti di altissimo livello, finanziati con i fondi del PNRR. Progetti che danno lustro all'intero Paese\". Per questo, dichiara con forza, \"serve un finanziamento straordinario e una programmazione che ci permetta di pianificare l'ingresso dei precari al nostro interno\".\nAl Centro Nazionale di Ricerca, poi, ad aspettare un contratto a tempo indeterminato ci sono ricercatori che da anni lavorano in piazza Aldo Moro. \"Hanno passato le selezioni, contribuito ai lavori e devono passare da un contratto a tempo determinato a uno a tempo indeterminato\", racconta Antonio Sanguinetti, ricercatore del CNR. E non nasconde l'amarezza: \"La presidente ci ha detto che non intende fare stabilizzazioni, ma vuole fare i concorsi. Senza chiarire né tempistiche, né numeri\".\nCoperte, sacchi a pelo, cibo portato da casa. È la rivolta dei precari, età media sulla quarantina. Erano nell'aula magna del CNR, quella che generalmente si utilizza per riunioni e convegni, ma si sono dovuti spostare al quarto piano perché faceva freddo. Troppo freddo. \"Il nostro futuro vale tutto questo. Ha idea di quanto sia degradante ritrovarsi alla nostra età senza poter programmare la propria vita? La nostra è in bilico di anno in anno\".\nCome la ricerca. Perchè, come spiega Valentina Tomassoni, \"questa situazione fa male ai progetti. Chi ci lavora, un anno c'è e l'anno dopo no\".",

    "text": "Iranian Christian refugee who suffered persecution now faces possible expulsion from Turkey An Iranian Christian convert faces possible expulsion from Turkey and a three-year prison sentence on a charge of spreading “propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” according to religious freedom advocates. The government of Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan continued its crackdown on expatriate Christians with the Jan. 29 arrest of Mojtaba Keshavarz Ahmadi, 56, on questionable immigration charges, according to a statement by advocacy group Article 18. “Despite being in Turkey for over a decade and applying for refugee status, Mojtaba has never been interviewed about his case and has therefore never been granted official protection,” the group reported. Turkish immigration authorities accused Ahmadi of leaving Düzce, his assigned city of residence, without prior government authorization. Ahmadi has denied the accusation, and Turkish authorities have yet to provide any evidence to support their claim, according to Article 18. The Turkish government assigns applicants for U.N. refugee status a city where they are required to live during the application processing. The aim is to spread the burden that close to 4 million refugees in Turkey could bring to any one area of the country. Authorities seized Ahmadi’s card identifying him as a candidate for refugee status and took him to an immigration detention center located just outside Ayvacık, in western Turkey near the Aegean Sea, where he remains. The status of any formal charges against him are unknown, and he has very few legal rights. “Facing a three-year prison sentence in Iran on account of his Christian faith and activities, there can be little doubt that Mojtaba is worthy of asylum,” Article 18 stated. The group highlighted the plight of Iranian Christian refugees in a joint [report](https://articleeighteen.com/news/13393/) last year, including the threat of deportation. Several other Iranian Christians have been transferred to deportation camps in recent years, the group stated. “There is a concerning trend, where individuals with valid asylum claims are being put in these camps, seemingly arbitrarily,” a source who wished to remain anonymous told Article 18. “There have been other instances in which … an immigration officer from the Turkish authorities has unexpectedly knocked on their door. If they don’t open the door, they are accused of not being in their designated location, whereas they may only have gone to the shops.” Ahmadi, the son of an Islamic cleric, fled to Turkey due to persecution in Iran. After putting his faith in Christ on Christmas Day in 2002, by March 2004 he’d begun participating in house-church meetings and “talked to many people about Christianity in the cities of Tehran, Qom, Kashan and Arak,” Ahmadi said in a witness statement to Article 18. In September 2010, four plainclothes security officials raided a small meeting of three Christians that Ahmadi was leading. The officers seized their Christian materials, including numerous Bibles and films about Christ. Authorities handcuffed and threw them into a van and blindfolded them. Iranian officials held Ahmadi in a detention center and then Arak prison for 170 days, he told Article 18. During the first week of his detention, Ahmadi was held in solitary confinement and interrogated several times a day, blindfolded and subjected to brutal beatings. “They beat me with their fists, with kicks, and with all their might,” he told Article 18. “They slapped, punched and kicked my whole body, especially my head and face. I don’t know how long it took; I only know that eventually, I surrendered myself to the punches and kicks of the interrogators.” Ahmadi credited his survival to a voice he heard after he was taken back to his cell following a beating. “I heard a clear and noble voice in my heart, saying: ‘Be still, and cling to me tightly!’ This voice in my heart gave me an unnatural strength,” Ahmadi told Article 18. “In those moments, it was only Jesus Christ who could give me the strength so that I could endure the physical and mental torture and be able to hold steadfastly and courageously to all my beliefs, and not deny them.” Eventually Ahmadi was found guilty of two crimes, “carrying out propaganda activities against the holy regime of the Islamic Republic,” and “insulting the sacred.” He was sentenced to three years in prison for each charge, but appealed. The second charge was eventually thrown out after a witness shouted in court that he had been forced into making a false confession against Ahmadi. The first charge stuck, however, and Ahmadi was sentenced to three years in prison. In November 2012, Ahmadi, who had appealed the court’s rulings in absentia, was informed that a judge had issued a warrant ordering he be arrested and taken to prison to begin his three-year sentence. Fearful of facing three years of beatings and other torture, Ahmadi fled the country and entered Turkey in March 2013. Ahmadi is hardly the first Iranian to face deportation from Turkey. Last year, Article 18 documented numerous cases of Turkish officials harassing Iranian Christian refugees. In one wave of arrests that lasted six months in 2023, officials rounded up five Iranian Christian refugee families and took them to detention centers, threatening them with deportation. Other Christians have been targeted in Turkey by a weaponized immigration and refugee system. Since a coup attempt in 2016, the Erdogan government has singled out expatriate Christians from the West for expulsion. Numerous long-term foreign residents, especially those in teaching or leadership roles in churches, have had their residency permits revoked without cause. Other expatriate Christians who had lived in Turkey without incident for decades have received an N-82 security code identifying them as a “threat to public order and security.” The immigration code acts as a ban for reentry into the country for those who leave. At least 75 foreign Christian workers and their families were kicked out of Turkey between 2020 and 2023, according to Open Doors. This figure does not begin to address the untold number of expatriate Christians who fled Turkey of their own accord out of fear. Turkey ranks 50th on Open Doors’ 2024 World Watch List of the most difficult places to be a Christian. Iran ranks ninth.

    "text": "Read more about how we evaluate products.\nOur favorite smart electric toothbrush is $70 off right now\nThat matches the lowest price yet on the Oral-B iO Series 7.\nThe\nOral-B iO Series 7 smart electric toothbrush is down to $149 at Amazon after a $71 discount. That matches the best price we've seen and returns it to the low it hit for the shopping holidays last year. The deal comes as part of a larger sale in which Oral-B toothbrushes are up to 55 percent off. We named the iO Series 7 the top pick in our guide to smart toothbrushes because it hits a good balance between features and affordability (particularly if you can catch it on sale like right now).\nOur top pick from our smart toothbrush guide is currently 32 percent off at Amazon.\n$149 at Amazon\nWe tested a handful of smart electric toothbrushes (in this case \"smart\" means app-connected) and ultimately liked this one best. It has a black and white LED screen that tells you helpful info like mode, battery life and how long is left on your two minute timer. The vibrating head is vigorous but not lip-numbing like other models we tried and the lighted ring helpfully indicates whether you're pushing too hard or not quite firmly enough.\nIf you want to brush while looking at your phone, you can watch an animated recreation of a set of teeth that slowly turns from blue to white as the internal sensors track the position and movement of your brush. It's a bit of a surreal experience, but I did notice my teeth felt cleaner after using this than they do with a standard brush.\nThis set comes with a replacement head, travel case and charging dock which you should only need to use a couple times per month. If you want something even fancier, the\nOral-B iO Series 9 is also on sale. The Series numbering refers to the level of features, not the newness of the brush, so Series 9 has extra brush modes, a color LED screen and a charging travel case — all of which the Series 7 lacks. Though in my tests, I didn't find those perks were worth an additional $100.\nFollow\n@EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",
