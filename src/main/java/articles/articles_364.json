    "text": "La Municipalidad de Rosario, a través de la Dirección General de Alumbrado Público dependiente de la Secretaría de Ambiente y Espacio Público, avanza con el recambio de luminarias con tecnología led en el sector comprendido por las avenidas Eva Perón y Provincias Unidas, Juan Pablo II (colectora de Circunvalación) y Mendoza, en el distrito Noroeste. En total se colocarán más de 500 luminarias led con sistema de telegestión. La tecnología led se destaca por proporcionar un ahorro energético por cada unidad instalada del 40%, permitiendo una utilización más eficaz de la energía. Además, el uso de tecnología led disminuye la contaminación y sienta las bases operativas para el desarrollo de una ciudad inteligente, permitiendo mayor celeridad en la gestión de los reclamos y más eficiencia a la hora de prestar el servicio. La unión de tecnologías lumínicas led con tecnologías de comunicación permite avanzar en soluciones que facilitan y optimizan la gestión del servicio de alumbrado público: un sistema de telegestión constituye una herramienta de control y supervisión para obtener datos e información en tiempo real sobre el comportamiento y la operatividad de cada luminaria, la detección temprana de posibles fallas (adelantándose al reclamo o la consulta del vecino en el 147), el horario de encendido, apagado y su consumo. Desde el municipio se recuerda que por consultas o reclamos sobre temas o cuestiones vinculadas con el alumbrado público, comunicarse con MuniBot, al número 147 o a través del perfil digital en rosario.gob.ar",

    "text": "An investigation is underway Thursday after Los Angeles Fire Department rescue crews freed 31 workers trapped in Wilmington after a 18-foot tunnel collapsed.\nMore than 100 firefighters — including Urban Search and Rescue team members specially trained and certified to handle confined-space tunnel operations — were dispatched to the 1700 block of North Figueroa Street shortly before 8 p.m Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nThe 31 workers, who were boring a tunnel for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts at the time of the collapse, were rescued with no visible injuries at around 9:45 p.m. Wednesday.\nThey managed to climb over a pile of loose soil, estimated to be 12 to 15 feet tall, with considerable effort, said Brian Humphrey, a spokesman with the LAFD.\nThey were able to reach several coworkers on the other side of the collapse and were taken in groups by a tunnel vehicle to the entry point, which is more than five miles away.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said when she heard about the collapse, she expected to find “tragedy- but instead, we found victory.”\nIt was unclear what caused the tunnel to collapse.\nTwenty-seven workers removed from the tunnel are being medically evaluated by LAFD paramedics at the scene, Humphrey said.\n“When I heard about this partial collapse, I rushed over fearing the worst,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, whose Fourth District, includes Wilmington, said on social media. “But we are so blessed tonight that all these men made it out safely”\nHahn is also a member of the sanitation districts’ Board of Directors.\n“LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for,” Bass added. “I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.’s true heroes.”\nThe 18-foot diameter excavation site was under construction for municipal wastewater management, which will serve five million people in the Los Angeles Basin, NBC4 reported.\n“Tonight, I am in Wilmington with Mayor Bass, L.A. Police Chief McDonnell and L.A. Fire Chief [Ronnie] VIllanueva and multiple emergency staff at the site of the Clearwater Project after reports of a tunnel collapse with multiple personnel in the tunnel,” .said Councilman Tim McOsker, who also represents Wilmington. “I am relieved to report that all 31 individuals working the shift have been accounted for are safe. I am grateful for the rapid response of our L.A. City Fire Department, which deployed over 100 personnel, including the Urban Search and Rescue teams.”\nThe incident commander requested that helicopters from television stations be no closer than one mile from the intersection of Figueroa Street and Lomita Boulevard because excessive noise from the helicopters above the rescue site was interfering with the ability of rescue personnel to effectively communicate face-to-face or via radio at ground level.\nNBC 4 reported the sanitation project was slated to be completed by the end of the year, but Michael Chee, a spokesman with Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, said all construction on the tunnel will be halted pending an investigation.",

    "text": "Unveiling Ukraine’s Groundbreaking Strategy\nUkraine’s President Zelensky has unveiled a groundbreaking strategy for the year 2024, aiming to propel the nation into the forefront of drone warfare. This ambitious plan involves the production of an astounding one million ‘suicide drones,’ officially known as loitering munitions. These unmanned aerial vehicles, recognized as a technological and tactical revolution, have emerged as a key player in modern warfare.\nRapid Production Surge\nSince the onset of Russia’s renewed invasion in 2022, Ukraine has demonstrated a remarkable surge in drone production. Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin proudly asserts the production of “more than 50,000 FPV drones” in December alone, This signals a substantial commitment to advancing its unmanned capabilities.\nRead More:\nAnalyzing ATF’s Proposed Firearm Sales Rule and NRA’s Concerns\nDiverse Drone Portfolio\nLooking ahead to 2024, Ukraine’s drone production portfolio is set to diversify significantly. In addition to the staggering goal of manufacturing over a million ‘kamikaze’ drones, plans include the production of more than 10,000 medium-range attack drones and 1,000+ long-range drones. This comprehensive approach showcases Ukraine’s intent to cover various operational requirements.\nFirst Person View (FPV) Drones\nAt the heart of this drone revolution are the First Person View (FPV) drones, which have become a defining element in the conflict. These agile and cost-effective unmanned vehicles have flooded social media, showcasing their prowess through videos capturing successful attacks from both Ukrainian and opposing forces.\nFPV Drone Setup\nThe typical FPV drone setup involves a lightweight commercial hobbyist drone affixed to small munitions. The pilot, equipped with live video goggles, gains a ‘first-person’ perspective during the drone’s mission, offering a unique and immersive experience.\nRead More:\nRepublicans Deny Senate a Ukraine and Israel Aid Deal Before Christmas\nAffordability and Asymmetry\nEmphasizing the affordability factor, Ukrainian authorities highlight that these drones cost only a few thousand dollars each. This cost-effective approach underscores the asymmetrical nature of their development, standing in stark contrast to the high expenses associated with traditional weapon systems.\nStrategic Significance\nNewsweek has lauded these drones as a “game-changer” and a “tech revolution,” reflecting their strategic importance in the evolving landscape of warfare. Government officials describe them as occasionally more efficient than artillery, underscoring their potential to reshape military strategies.\nDrone Pilot Training\nA pivotal aspect of this drone-centric approach is the extensive training of drone pilots. Ukraine claims to be producing thousands of skilled drone operators through private schools across the country. The operational synergy between FPV and photography drones is vital for effective reconnaissance and targeting.\nAlso Read:\nNew York’s Groundbreaking Gun Law Ruling: A Game-Changer for Public Safety!\nOperational Dynamics\nMastering FPV drones requires skilled pilots, and intriguingly, individuals with experience in computer games, particularly PlayStation, demonstrate superior performance. The operational dynamics involve a synchronized effort between FPV and photography drones, providing a multi-faceted approach to intelligence gathering.\nEffectiveness in Warfare\nDespite their undeniable effectiveness, these drones contribute to a challenging stalemate in the ongoing conflict. General Valery Zaluzhny acknowledges the limitations imposed by the saturation of battlefield intelligence, eroding the element of surprise in military assaults.\nImpact on Conflict Dynamics\nFPV drones have undeniably altered the dynamics of warfare, offering real-time intelligence and precision targeting. The evolving nature of the conflict reflects both the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of drone technology into military strategies.\nRead Next:\nRepublicans slam Washington Post op-ed which suggested ‘open rebellion\nGlobal Implications\nUkraine’s ambitious drone production plan sets a global precedent, signaling a transformative shift toward the widespread integration of unmanned systems in modern warfare. The international community keenly observes these developments, recognizing the profound implications for global security and conflict resolution.\nTechnologically Advanced Nation\nPresident Zelensky’s vision for a million ‘suicide drones’ underscores Ukraine’s unwavering commitment to technological advancements in defense. As drones assume an increasingly central role in warfare, their impact on conflict dynamics and global security remains a subject of international scrutiny and concern.",
