If we’re competing at our best, that’s really the time that we win,” said Guiao. “But in the last two games, we played half-heartedly, we didn’t play with force and we didn’t show enough determination to compete.\nArticle continues after this advertisement “But I guess, losing two games is a good thing for us. It’s a wake-up call and a way to reset our mindset,” he added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Seven players scored in double figures, led by import Deon Thompson’s 27. Locals Santi Santillan, Adrian Nocum, Anton Asistio and Andrei Caracut, who struggled during the team’s skid, were all part of the big offensive show for Rain or Shine.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The E-Painters will hope to build on the victory going into a marquee tussle with Barangay Ginebra on Wednesday next week at Ynares Center in Antipolo City in a key battle for playoff positioning.\n“Ginebra’s been playing well, but I’m confident that the team can get the job done, as long as we’re competing,” said Guiao.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Ginebra is also in dire need of a win on Friday, also at Philsports, against TNT at 7:30 p.m.—the first meeting between both teams since the conclusion of the Governors’ Cup Finals last November.\nTNT, which won that series in six games, climbed to the top of the leaderboard with a 5-2 (win-loss) record and with NorthPort’s setback, having been on a roll after back-to-back defeats to open the conference.\nThe Tropang Giga downed the slumping NLEX Road Warriors, 94-87, on late Wednesday at Ninoy Aquino Stadium.\nEastern is favored to hand winless Terrafirma its 11th defeat in the 5 p.m. curtain raiser on Friday.\nNorthPort fell to 7-3 to tie Converge after another double-digit defeat. The Batang Pier started the week with a 17-point loss at the hands of the Bolts.\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - Newsfile Corp) Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 17, 2024) - Badlands Resources Inc. (TSXV: BLDS) (FSE: B7Q) (\" Badlands \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce the successful results from its fall 2023 field exploration program, identifying multiple high-grade Gold trends at the Bella Project, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\nNews Highlights\nFive Main High-Grade gold Trends: The company identified five main high-grade gold trends with approximately 20 km of strike length at surface through mapping and sampling. Grab Samples Returned Assays up to 20 g/t Au. Out of the 420 grab samples collected, 60 samples returned over 5 g/t Au .\nGold mineralization hosted in Banded-Iron Formation. Only 40% of the prospective mineralized unit has been prospected by the Company. Systematic Approach. The initial program has assisted in prioritizing the main targets for advanced exploration given that the mineralized unit has a surface expression of 50 km.\nDale Ginn, President and CEO of Badlands, commented, \"The initial success of the 2023 Field Program gives confidence of the gold prospectivity in the Black Hills. Historically, the Company's focus was drilling deep extensions of the Standby Mine, but these samples reinforce the high-grade gold potential at surface. Badlands will continue to advance the near surface targets through exploration efforts of the team.\"\nFigure 1 . Badlands 2023 Field Exploration Program, identifying five major gold trend at the Bella Project\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nDiscussion of Results\nThe Bella project covers a large under-explored package of banded iron formation hosted in a greenstone to amphibolite facies sedimentary and volcanic succession. The project shares striking similarities to the Homestake Mine which is located 30 km to the north. At both locations, the gold is concentrated in the local iron formation, particularly where it is has been thickened by regional folding. The iron formation at the two locations has been noted to be stratigraphically distinct but nearly identical in composition.\nBadlands collected a total of 420 rock samples to investigate prospective areas identified from Lidar and historical data. Results have highlighted five trends which the Company plans to follow up on with systematic surface sampling and possible drill targeting. These trends have been named Lookout, Standard, Cochrane, King of West, and Montezuma.\nLookout Trend\nThe Lookout trend extends 2.5 km southeast from the historic Standby Mine. The majority of samples were collected from the altered, sheered, and folded Rochford iron formation which locally encompasses the Nahant Schist and Rapid Creek Greenstone. Grab sample highlights include 19.2 g/t Au, 18.95 g/t Au, and 17.7 g/t Au.\nFigure 2 .

The samples were analyzed for gold using fire assay and ICP-AES (code Au-ICP21). Overlimit samples (>10 g/t Au) were given a gravimetric finish (codeAu-GRA21).\nThe Company also advises that the private placement announced in its news release of July 30, 2024, has been cancelled.\nAbout Badlands\nBadlands, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is a gold focused exploration company in the Black Hills, South Dakota. The Company has strategically consolidated 7,858 acres, 20 km along trend from the Homestake Mine that produced 42 million ounces of gold. The Bella Project has over 90% of exposed Banded Iron Formation not covered by sampling and is determined to explore the near surface potential.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors\nBADLANDS RESOURCES INC.\nR.

    "text": "Garza admitted: “We’re a very liberal paper. I didn’t think we were going to change the outcome of the election in California.” Mariel Garza resigned from her position as the Los Angeles Times editorial editor because the publication’s owner didn’t allow the board to make a presidential endorsement. On October 11, owner Patrick Soon-Shiong told the board they couldn’t make an endorsement. Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review : “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,” Garza told me in a phone conversation. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” — “I didn’t think we were going to change our readers’ minds—our readers, for the most part, are Harris supporters,” Garza told me. “We’re a very liberal paper. I didn’t think we were going to change the outcome of the election in California. “But two things concern me: This is a point in time where you speak your conscience no matter what. And an endorsement was the logical next step after a series of editorials we’ve been writing about how dangerous Trump is to democracy, about his unfitness to be president, about his threats to jail his enemies. We have made the case in editorial after editorial that he shouldn’t be reelected.” — “It was a logical next step,” Garza told me. “And it’s perplexing to readers, and possibly suspicious, that we didn’t endorse her this time.” The LA Times didn’t endorse anyone from 1976 to 2004 after it endorsed Nixon in 1972. Watergate embarrassed the publication. But the newspaper endorsed former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Joe Biden in 2020. The LA Times endorsed Harris for California attorney general in 2014 and senator in 2016. The board endorsed Republican Steve Cooley for attorney general in 2010. Soon-Shiong explained on X : So many comments about the @latimes Editorial Board not providing a Presidential endorsement this year. Let me clarify how this decision came about. The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation. In addition, the Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years. In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years. Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision. Please #vote. So many comments about the [@latimes]Editorial Board not providing a Presidential endorsement this year. Let me clarify how this decision came about.The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH… — Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) [October 23, 2024] Garza claimed she did not receive “a request for such an analysis.

El cuerpo humano se desintoxica naturalmente\ngracias a las funciones del hígado y riñones, ¡no necesitas ningún jugo!\nMito 2: “El jugo verde ayuda a bajar de peso”\n¡Falso! No existe alimento, jugo o medicamento mágico para bajar de peso.\nPara ello, se requiere de dieta, ejercicio y dormir bien\nMito 3: “Si le pones jugo de naranja colado al jugo verde es mejor”\n¡Mentira! Poner jugo de naranja colado\nsólo aumenta la cantidad de azúcar\ny reduce la valiosa fibra de la fruta\nLos verdaderos beneficios del jugo verde son:\n☑ Gran opción para quienes no comen muchas frutas y verduras\n☑ Rico en vitaminas, minerales y antioxidantes\nAunque el jugo verde puede ser bueno para la salud…\n… lo mejor es tomarlo como parte de una dieta correcta y\nno como un sustituto de alimentos\nFuente:\nISSSTE",
