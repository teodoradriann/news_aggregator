    "title": "Brighton & Hove Albion 4-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Seagulls shock Spurs before late goals add drama - Cartilage Free Captain",
    "text": "It was a clash of the “who has the biggest injury list” titans at The AMEX for [Tottenham Hotspur](https://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com)’s first post-Christmas fixture, as Spurs took on a limping Brighton & Hove Albion. The Seagulls were missing a number of first team players, with the likes of Joel Veltman and Kaoru Mitoma possibly those having the most impact. From Tottenham’s perspective, the revolving door of injured or suspended defensive players continued, with Cristian Romero out with a hamstring strain, Yves Bissouma suspended, and Oliver Skipp the latest addition to the hospital ward, missing the match with a knock. The signs were ominous for Tottenham’s makeshift backline early on, as Danny Welbeck got in behind twice for huge chances. Guglielmo Vicario was heroic, however, in goal, with the second save especially a fantastic stop on a huge chance, as Welbeck found himself essentially free on the penalty spot. Spurs couldn’t hold out Brighton for long though, as Joao Pedro slalomed through the Tottenham defense from Brighton’s left, before laying a pass off to right back Jack Hinshelwood. His shot across Vicario was well-struck and Brighton were in the lead. It was poor defending by Spurs, who had multiple chances to dispossess the Brazilian attacker. Joao Pedro continued to have chances, cutting inside Pedro Porro and forcing another good save from Vicario, before a header from a corner crashed off the post, causing a melee in the Tottenham box. After a short period, VAR instructed the referee to review a shirt pull on the monitor, as Dejan Kulusevski looked to have pulled down Welbeck. The former England striker absolutely sold the contact, but it was stupid from Kulusevski (who I clearly haven’t insulted enough lately). He collected a yellow card for his troubles and added himself to the suspended list as the referee pointed to the spot. Pedro stepped up and cooly converted the penalty. It wasn’t all one-way traffic, as Brennan Johnson soon found himself through on goal. He somehow spurned the chance though with a poor touch as he had only the keeper to beat, as well as three fellow attackers as options. Brighton went up the other end, and looked like they had added insult to injury with a third after Buonanotte ran in behind the Tottenham backline to finish off a cross from the right. This time, fortunately, the linesman’s flag saved Spurs, with the Argentine caught offside. Things just weren’t clicking for Spurs, as a terrible Pedro Porro backpass played Joao Pedro through on goal. Fortunately for the Spaniard, the winger was unable to put Brighton three up thanks to yet another intervention from Vicario. The resultant set piece almost ended up with a goal the other way, however, with Spurs breaking up the other end and Richarlison hitting the post from the top of the 18-yard box. That, and a late bending effort from Son that went wide were all Spurs could muster to close out the half, as Brighton took a 2-0 lead to the sheds. You wouldn’t have blamed Ange Postecoglou for making changes after a poor half of football, but instead Brighton opened the half with a substitution of their own: Pervis Estupinan, previously linked with Spurs, came on at left back in a straight swap for Igor, as Roberto De Zerbi looked to lock things down. It was Tottenham though who started brightly, as Richarlison had the ball in the net almost immediately; unfortunately, the linesman’s flag went up as the Brazilian #9 hadn’t managed to hold his run. Richarlison was getting himself more involved, hitting a big chance narrowly wide, then again getting flagged offside on a chance in behind, before Destiny Udogie was denied with a double save from Jason Steele. Spurs were looking better, and once more had the ball in the net only for Richarlison to play it again, Sam, and be flagged offside. All the positive second half play came to nothing, however, as substitute Estupinan hit an absolute golazo from long distance. It was one of those strikes you just have to shrug your shoulders at, as Vicario picked the ball out of his net for the third time. Postecoglou made a double change in response, with Bryan Gil and Giovani Lo Celso coming on for Pape Matar Sarr and Richarlison, before Alejo Veliz entered the fray for Johnson, but it was too little, too late for Spurs, who were shellshocked. Brighton soon had a fourth as it seemed Tottenham had collapsed. Lo Celso made an idiotic challenge on Evan Ferguson in the box, the striker went down, and the referee awarded the clear penalty. Joao Pedro duly dispatched the spot kick, and it was four. There was though a late strike for Spurs, with a first Premier League goal for Veliz. Deki did well in the press to win the ball from Lewis Dunk, before Son fed the ball across the box to the young Argentine striker. His shot was scuffed, but dribbled past Steele, and Veliz deservedly celebrated. There was further late drama, however, as a late goal from Ben Davies off a Pedro Porro cross cast fear into the hearts of Brighton supporters. Regardless of the scoreline, all the play was with Tottenham, as they battered the Brighton defense trying to get themselves back in the game. Hojbjerg hit the post, and there were some late penalty shouts, but Brighton were able to withstand the Spurs assault, and secured themselves a 4-2 win. Reactions - I was just gonna write fart noise but those late goals made me actually put some effort in. So screw Spurs for that. - That was a terrible first half, up there with the performance against Wolves. The attack in particular were terrible. If you tweaked the colors on the playing strips, you might have thought Brighton were Spurs, as they opened up the Tottenham defense time and again, while the Spurs front four just froze when they got close to the Brighton box. - Speaking of the attack, I was somewhat bemused by Postecoglou’s decision to pull Richarlison first. He was the only one of the front four really doing anything; Son particularly was a total black hole of possession. - Emerson Royal really struggled at center back today, but it was in part due to a pretty poor performance from Sarr. Sarr seemed to keep getting caught out of position in the press, so Royal would come to try close down that half-space, Davies and Udogie would shift over, and you’d end up with three Brighton attackers against two Tottenham defenders. - Speaking of the backline, we really missed Romero’s passing out of the back today. At one point, it felt like the Spurs defenders thought they were playing - Whatever Spurs paid for Bryan Gil, it was far too much. He was awful today, and I’d rather see one of the youth come on as a substitute. He just doesn’t have a future in the Premier League, let alone at Spurs. - Uh... so that tackle from Dunk on Dejan Kulusevski was very similar to the one Romero was sent off for in the Chelsea match. Not sure how Dunk stayed on the field. - Speaking of Deki, he is now suspended. That’s gonna make Bournemouth fun. - COYS!",

    "text": "Pourquoi c'est important Fini la douceur, les températures vont brusquement chuter ce week-end Après le printemps précoce, l'hiver tardif... L'ambiance sera globalement fraîche, humide et venteuse, ce week-end. On va perdre jusqu'à 10 degrés en 24 heures. Avec des risques de gelées limités sur les cultures. Vous avez rangé les écharpes ? Il va falloir les ressortir... Car après la [remarquable douceur de cette semaine](/environnement/2024/03/14/pluies-orages-chaleur-quel-temps-fera-t-il-au-printemps), les températures vont dégringoler durant le week-end. Une semaine marquée par une grande douceur... Le printemps était bien au rendez-vous cette semaine. Mercredi, les températures ont même approché les 27 °C en Ariège, selon La Chaîne Météo. Les 25 °C ont par ailleurs été dépassés en Dordogne, en Corrèze et dans les Pyrénées-Atlantiques. Près de la Méditerranée, les températures ont également plusieurs fois atteint localement les 25 °C ces derniers jours, tandis que les 20 °C ont parfois gagné la moitié nord pour la première fois de l'année. Jeudi, il a encore fait 20 °C à Paris, 22 °C à Lyon, 21 °C à Clermont-Ferrand... Des températures au-dessus des normales de saison. En effet, selon La Chaîne Météo, la barre des 20 °C dans la capitale est en moyenne franchie le 30 mars. La douceur survient donc cette année avec 10 jours d'avance. Mais l'hiver n'a pas dit son dernier mot ! Ce vendredi devrait toutefois être la dernière journée durant laquelle vous allez pouvoir profiter de ce beau temps printanier, car une dégradation s'amorce... Et le week-end s'annonce, lui, nettement plus frais ! Au programme, des giboulées, et des averses, surtout au Nord et à l'Est, avec même le retour de la neige à basse altitude sur certains massifs montagneux. Les températures, elles, dégringolent. Avec par endroits jusqu'à 10 °C de différence entre vendredi et samedi, le mercure culminant entre 8 et 12 °C sur la moitié nord. Sur la moitié sud, le soleil sera plus généreux, mais le vent frais se lèvera en Méditerranée, avec notamment une forte tramontane. Faut-il craindre des gelées sur les cultures ? Après ce week-end agité, le ciel s’éclaircira rapidement dans la nuit de dimanche à lundi, favorisant la chute des températures nocturnes, et donc le risque de gelées, notamment dans le Centre-Est. Ce gel de printemps inquiète particulièrement les agriculteurs, car après un hiver anormalement doux (+2 °C par rapport aux normales, et même +3,5 °C sur le seul mois de février), la végétation est en avance... Toutefois, selon les dernières prévisions de La Chaîne Météo, le risque de gelées restera limité ce lundi, notamment en ce qui concerne les arbres fruitiers. Les prévisionnistes de La Chaîne Météo préviennent toutefois que le risque de gel existe toujours jusqu'à la fin du mois d'avril et même jusqu'en mai dans les régions proches des frontières du nord-est.",

The products are not designed for hospital beds.\nHealth Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada.\nIt says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund.\nThe recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ.\nNo information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S.\nDrive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued.\nMore than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

    "text": "Why this woman is on a mission to create a ‘safe haven’ for Richmond kids\nBy Shelby Brown, WTVR CBS 6 Web Staff\nClick here for updates on this story\nRICHMOND, Virginia (\nWTVR) — Crime scene tape and lights from police cars mixed with holiday lights and decorations when two people were shot at a Richmond apartment complex off Walmsley Boulevard on Christmas Eve.\nThose scenes keep nonprofit founder Chenice Brown-Johnson on a mission to help address gun violence that families across the city are dealing with. That is why her Just C organization has a special focus on helping young people navigate these difficult times.\n“Violence interrupts families. It interrupts communities,” Brown-Johnson said. “So we are hoping that by us providing this space, kids can come and feel free to be themselves without all the stigmas of their communities.”\nThat is why Brown-Johnson is pouring her heart into opening a building near Mosby Court, a public housing neighborhood that she serves.\nBrown-Johnson is turning the tiny space into a community center she believes will have a huge impact on young people who may be living with trauma from gun violence.\n“So the kids that I serve have lost parents to gun violence and they’ve lost siblings to gun violence,” Brown-Johnson said. “And it’s just a part of you that never quite heals.”\nThrough her nonprofit’s community outreach initiatives, Brown-Johnson takes young people on trips to expand their horizons. That way they can grow and know that there are positive opportunities out there and that they have support.\n“We are looking to create a safe haven for kids that gives them direct resources for them to elevate themselves,” Brown-Johnson explained. “Being able to have a lot of open-minded and open-hearted conversations, we can help dissolve some of the things going on in the streets.”\nBrown-Johnson believes the center will have the power to save lives and is seeking donor support from others in the community who also have a heart to help.\n“What we need at this time is we need community partners. We need furniture. We need supplies and we need mentors,” Brown-Johnson said.\nThe Just C Community Center will be located at 707 Mosby Street in Richmond.\nIf you’d like to donate or volunteer with the nonprofit:\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

[LEARN MORE](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/cinnamon-in-recalled-applesauce-pouches-had-extremely-high-lead-levels/) Nearly 5 million BlendJet devices in the U.S. and Canada will need to be replaced due to fire or injury risk. Portable blender maker Blendjet is recalling nearly 5 million of its devices after receiving dozens of injury reports and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in consumer property damage. The [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/BlendJet-Recalls-4-8-Million-BlendJet-2-Portable-Blenders-Due-to-Fire-and-Laceration-Hazards) issued a warning Thursday saying the company's BlendJet 2 Portable Blenders could overheat or catch fire and that their blades can break off while in use, affecting about 4.8 million products in the U.S. and 117,000 in Canada. — US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) [#Recall]: 4.8 Million [@BlendJet]2 Portable Blenders. The blenders can overheat or catch fire & the blender blades can break off. Get Free Replacement. Contact: [https://t.co/xqAPoZ0us1]or 844-334-0562. Full recall notice: [https://t.co/vXrV3uD3Ce] [pic.twitter.com/leQrtnmBn3] [December 28, 2023] So far, there have been 329 reports of blades coming off during use and 17 additional reports of overheating or fires that resulted in about $150,000 in property damage claims. These incidents also caused 49 reported minor burn injuries and one reported laceration injury. \"Out of an abundance of caution, our company updated the base of the BlendJet 2 to feature thicker blades and an improved electrical configuration,\" BlendJet said Thursday. \"These updates were incorporated many months ago into all BlendJet 2 devices manufactured by the company.\" The affected products were sold from October 2020 through November 2023 at Costco, Walmart, Target and other stores nationwide and online. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Although BlendJet says the BlendJet 2s that are currently for sale are safe to use, the CPSC says consumers should verify if theirs is included and immediately stop use if so. To check your device's safety, identify the serial number printed on the bottom of the base. Those with the first four digits between 5201 and 5542 are subject to the recall. You can also go to BlendJet's [product recall tool](https://blendjet.com/safetyandrecall) to complete the identification process. If your device is affected, contact BlendJet for a free replacement of the blender's base unit. You will need to remove and cut the base's rubber seal and email or upload a photo to the company's website to receive the replacement part.
