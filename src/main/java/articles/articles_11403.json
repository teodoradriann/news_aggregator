    "title": "Creators have turned golf content into an arms race. A top-ranked player thinks it's hurting the sport.",
    "text": "Golf content is currently undergoing a boom on platforms like YouTube, but the category’s rising popularity might come with some drawbacks. As golf creators hurry to make deals with the competing PGA Tour and LIV Golf circuits, Rory McIlroy is questioning whether that gold rush goes against the spirit of the game.\nBased on what’s already gone down in the golf world since the start of the year, 2025 is shaping up to be a banner year for creators on the links — much like 2024 was for football and basketball content. The PGA Tour has already announced that it will host a trio of creator tournaments throughout the 2025 calendar year. Not to be outdone, Saudi-backed LIV Golf has struck a deal with Rick Shiels , one of the most-subscribed golfers on YouTube.\nThis massive moment has been a long time coming. After getting millions of views and launching offline ventures in 2023, golf creators leveled up in 2024, when they hung out with PGA Tour stars and competed in tournaments of their own .\nIf the PGA Tour is following the NFL’s playbook for social media success, the next step is to bring more pro players into the fray. Some top golfers have already collaborated with the YouTube stars of the links. After getting millions of views for his Tiger Woods team-up, Grant Horvat returned to YouTube’s trending tab alongside longtime Woods rival Phil Mickelson .\nTiger and Lefty may be eager to explore the world of YouTube, but another former #1 player is not so enthused. In an interview with the Fresno Bee , McIlroy argued that golf creators have “diminished” the sport’s core product. Though he admitted that upstarts like Horvat are “killing it” by making “really cool” content that pleases “a lot of people,” he believes that the on-course product deserves more attention.\n“I would much rather sit down and watch real golfers play real tournaments,” McIlroy said . “To me, that’s more entertaining. But I understand other people want something different, and that’s totally fine as well. I think there’s space for all of this.”\nMcIlroy may be onto something. Sports creators may not get in the way of the games themselves, but they do shift the balance of power toward individual athletes . Does the increasing focus on the drama surrounding sports detract from the enjoyment of the action? Rory McIlroy seems to think so — but your mileage may vary.",

    "text": "Joshua defeats Ngannou with brutal second-round knockout Riyadh – Two-time world champion Anthony Joshua knocked out mixed martial arts star Francis Ngannou in just the second round of their heavyweight clash in the early hours of Saturday. Joshua had his Cameroonian opponent on the canvas in the first round and twice more in the second in a brutal and brief exhibition of punching power. Ngannou, 37, a former UFC heavyweight champion, was taking part in only his second professional boxing match, having lost a split decision to Tyson Fury in an October fight that saw him put the WBC champion on the canvas in the third round. “I thought this fight was something for the broadcasters to get behind,” Joshua told broadcaster DAZN after his quickfire victory. “When I saw the fight with Tyson Fury, I thought, ‘I want some of that’. He is a great champion and this doesn’t take anything away from his capabilities. “I told (Ngannou) not to leave boxing. He’s two fights in and he fought the best.” Joshua, a former unified WBO, WBA and IBF heavyweight champion, went into the fight on the back of three successive wins. Before that, however, he lost back-to-back fights to Oleksandr Usyk, who will fight Fury for the undisputed heavyweight title in Saudi Arabia in May. The fight only got under way at 3:30 am local time (0030 GMT), but weary fans enjoyed a sensational start when Joshua quickly sent Ngannou to the canvas in the opening round with a brutal right to the chin. It got worse for the Cameroonian when he was knocked down again in the second round, just managing to beat the count. But his resistance lasted just a few more moments after he was sent to the canvas again for the third and final time. He lay on his back for some time and needed medical treatment inside the ring before being helped back to his stool. Joshua, 34, was reportedly being paid $50 million for his clash with Ngannou, whose rags-to-riches story had captivated the sport. The MMA star grew up in abject poverty, working as a child labourer in a sand quarry for under $2 a day. Ngannou then made his way to Europe, even sleeping rough in a car park in Paris before a local coach took him under his wing and guided him to boxing.",

    "text": "The discovery and preclinical efficacy of ANS-858, a proprietary, selective, reversible, orally bioavailable ALDH2 inhibitor will be presented at 48 th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcohol.\nSAN FRANCISCO , April 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Amygdala Neurosciences, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the research and development of novel therapies for addiction and compulsive overeating disorders, has announced a significant milestone in its drug development pipeline. The company has selected ANS-858 as its lead clinical candidate. This marks a crucial step forward in bringing a potentially transformative treatment to patients suffering from these debilitating conditions.\nANS-858 is a new, proprietary, small molecule inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). By inhibiting ALDH2, ANS-858 aims to reduce the rewarding effects associated with alcohol and other substances, thereby mitigating the risk of relapse and offering a path toward abstinence while also reducing anxiety.\nThe selection of ANS-858 follows an extensive preclinical evaluation demonstrating strong efficacy, selectivity, and a favorable safety profile. ALDH2 inhibition represents a promising mechanism for reducing consumption of addictive drugs by affecting the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway to reduce cravings. Unlike traditional therapies, ANS-858 is designed to provide greater tolerability, improved dosing flexibility, and optimized pharmacokinetics.\n\"Amygdala Neurosciences is committed to advancing the treatment landscape for substance use disorder, a condition with significant unmet medical need,\" said Brent K Blackburn, PhD, CEO. \"The selection of ANS-858 for clinical development marks a key milestone in our mission to develop safe and effective therapeutics for individuals struggling with SUD. Our team is preparing to initiate first-in-human clinical trials to evaluate ANS-858's potential in reducing addictive drug consumption and promoting recovery.\"\nOne in five adult Americans, or 48 million people, have a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. Alcohol use disorder affects over 28 million adults in the United States , yet current treatment options remain limited. There are 1.2 million patients with cocaine use disorder, where no medical treatment options are available. ANS-858 is designed to provide a targeted, pharmacological approach to modulating dopamine biosynthesis in the brain without affecting basal levels, offering a novel alternative to existing therapies.\nAmygdala Neurosciences plans to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and advance ANS-858 into Phase 1 clinical trial.\nAmygdala Neurosciences to present at the Research Society on Alcohol.\nThe Annual Scientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcohol (RSA) aims to bring together alcohol researchers from various disciplines to share their latest findings and stay updated on new research developments. It fosters both professional and personal interactions in a collaborative environment. The meeting is being held in New Orleans, LA , June 21-25, 2025 .\nAbout ANS-858\nANS-858, a proprietary new chemical entity, works in the brain's 'neural interface between motivation and action' to reduce the dopamine surge responsible for craving. Inhibition of ALDH2 has been shown to reduce drug seeking behavior in preclinical studies against multiple addictive agents and has the potential for use as pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders (SUD), binge-eating, and anxiety. Amygdala Neurosciences is developing ANS-858 for the safe treatment of SUD that includes alcohol and cocaine use disorders.\nAbout Amygdala Neurosciences, Inc .\nAmygdala Neurosciences is developing ANS-858 to curb craving. Its mission is to treat individuals who experience harmful cravings associated with chemicals of addiction and food. The company was formed based on technology discovered and developed by members of the companies' leadership team while at CV Therapeutics and acquired from Gilead Sciences.\nResearch reported in this press release was supported by the National Institute On Alcohol Abuse And Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health under Award Numbers U43AA030689 and R43AA029311.

The new facility, located on a 600-rai (approximately 948,000 square metres) plot within the WHA Industrial Estate in [Rayong](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aimAfSMNbsa6JPLT6), was officially opened yesterday, July 4. This marks BYD’s expansion into the global market with an investment exceeding 35 billion baht, covering nine projects including parts and battery production. The plant has a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year. Its new production line in Rayong opened just in time to commemorate the production of its eight millionth vehicle, its midrange BYD Dolphin model. This particular unit will be donated to the Mae Fah Luang Foundation under Royal Patronage. The Chinese automotive and technology giant initially entered the Thai market with the entry-level Atto 3 model. BYD now plans to expand the production capabilities of its [newly-built factory](https://thethaiger.com/tag/factory) to cover most of its EV fleet within the year. The establishment of the Rayong plant was facilitated by incentives from the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI). The construction, which spanned 16 months, aligns with BYD’s commitment to energy efficiency and low carbon emissions. The facility features automated machinery, eco-friendly production processes, and advanced logistics management systems. The manufacturing process encompasses four main stages: stamping, welding, painting, and assembly, ensuring high-quality EV production for the Thai market. Once fully operational, the Rayong plant is expected to create over 10,000 jobs. BYD’s strategic move to establish a manufacturing hub in Thailand underscores its ambition to be a key player in the global EV market, leveraging Thailand’s strategic location and investment-friendly policies. In [similar news](https://thethaiger.com/news/national/byd-price-cuts-spark-outrage-among-existing-customers), BYD’s recent price cuts have sparked significant outrage among its customers, who feel that they have lost substantial amounts of money due to the new promotions. The [electric vehicle](https://thethaiger.com/tag/electric-cars) (EV) manufacturer announced discounts of up to 340,000 baht, leading to a wave of discontent among early adopters who purchased vehicles before the price drop.

    "text": "Kevin Hart sues former assistant after interview with embattled YouTuber Tasha K\n\"Kebe has an established history of posting defamatory and otherwise improper content regarding celebrities,\" per Hart's lawsuit, which lists his former assistant Miesha Shakes and Kebe as defendants.\nKevin Hart has filed a lawsuit against his former assistant following an interview she did with embattled YouTuber Tasha K in which she accused the entertainer of cheating on his wife.\nPeople obtained Hart’s complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in response to an online interview between Miesha Shakes, who worked for his company from August 2017 until October 2020, and Tasha K — real name Latasha Kebe.\nThe caption on a preview from the interview said, “The interview that Kevin Hart will WISH NEVER CAME OUT!!”\n“Kebe has an established history of posting defamatory and otherwise improper content regarding celebrities,” per Hart’s lawsuit, which lists Shakes and Kebe as defendants.\nThe interview, published on Kebe’s Instagram account and the YouTube channel “Unwine with Tasha K” on Dec. 22, included allegations from Shakes that Hart had an affair at his workplace. She claimed she informed Hart’s wife, Eniko Hart, of the comedian’s infidelity and his alleged gambling addiction.\nHart, 44, and his ex-wife, Torrei Hart, share a daughter, Heaven, 18 and a son, Hendrix, 16,. Following their 2011 divorce,\nHart married Eniko Hart; they share a son, Kenzo, 6, and a daughter, Kaori, 3.\nThe suit claims that in November, a person “affiliated with Kebe” contacted a Hart representative and informed them that the recorded interview would damage Hart’s reputation. “The individual stated that Kebe would publish the interview unless Hart paid a ransom of $250,000,” the lawsuit states, People reported.\nEntertainment\nAccording to the lawsuit, Hart called the police and gave Kebe a cease-and-desist order, requesting that she not release the interview. Citing Shakes and Hart’s NDA, it stated that publishing the interview “would constitute intentional interference with contractual relations.”\nHart’s complaint stated that the interview contained false and defamatory allegations about him and several legal problems, in addition to breaking the NDA. It also accused Shakes of making false statements “including that Hart recorded a video of a sexual encounter, and that he faced criminal charges regarding that supposed incident.”\nHart is suing the defendants for invasion of privacy and civil extortion. He is also suing Kebe for intentional interference with contractual relations and Shakes for defamation and breach of contract.\n“Kebe has an established history of posting defamatory and otherwise improper content regarding celebrities,” states Hart’s lawsuit.\nWhile People reportedly could not reach Shakes for comment, Kebe responded to their request by saying: “Watch the full interview on TashaKLive.com.”\nRapper\nCardi B successfully sued Kebe in a libel case in 2022, accusing the YouTuber of making “malicious” claims against her.\nKebe has also come under fire for airing an interview about an alleged intimate relationship between Will Smith and Duane Martin. Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, publicly denied the accusations, with the latter indicating they would take legal action.\nNever miss a beat:\nGet our daily stories straight to your inbox with theGrio’s newsletter.",

My 15th birthday party turned into a failed plan, but God comforted me through a call to go on a mission trip to Chile. He always does what is best for us,” he said. Melissa explained that the economic obstacle was something that initially prevented her from achieving her goal. Citing the passage of Joshua and Caleb to enter the Promised Land, the teenager stated: “Before me is a great Promised Land, and I see insurmountable barriers. “I am crossing the desert, but I do not want to lose sight of the vision of Canaan,” she declared. Prayed to the Lord Melissa prayed and asked the Lord to help her. After asking for donations on social media and receiving help from her mother to supplement the amount by selling truffles, she got the money to pay for her trip. In addition, the teenager also donated part of the money raised to help a friend, who was also unable to travel to Chile. Melissa thanked everyone who gave her the opportunity to make her dream come true: “My parents, friend and even the people who encouraged, prayed and donated to my campaign, without you, none of this would be possible,” she said. Finally she shared: “I am a normal teenager, like everyone else, but I seek the Lord tirelessly,” Melissa concluded. Published by: NOTICIACRISTIANA.COM.

    "text": "The textile industry is a major polluter, producing 92 million tons of textile waste globally each year, according to Boston University.\nUniversity of Minnesota Duluth associate professor Abigail Clarke-Sather and her team say they have developed a machine that makes textiles more recyclable: The Fiber Shredder, patent pending, has been six years in the making and breaks down waste fabrics into recyclable materials in just 90 seconds.\n“It’s interesting to be both faculty and an entrepreneur at the same time,” Clarke-Sather wrote in a news release. “It makes me really excited to feel like I’m part of a broad coalition of people trying to make our world more sustainable.”\nClarke-Sather’s background is in civil and environmental engineering, as well as fashion and apparel. Understanding the intersection of those industries inspired her to address fashion industry sustainability issues.\nThe machine renders fabric into fibers that eventually will become yarn. Although the Fiber Shredder still is undergoing fine-tuning, the aim is to create new garments from the recycled materials.\n“Someday, the goal is that you could buy a shirt that is 100% recycled,” said Hira Durrani, a master’s student working on the project.\nIn addition to fabrics like polyester, cotton and spandex, the Fiber Shredder can even break down and recycle silicone used in products like rubber car mats, Durrani said.\nOther machines typically only cut fibers, but the Fiber Shredder pulls them apart, making the product easier to spin into yarn. Surplus textiles often overwhelm donation-based thrift stores like Goodwill, leading many unsold garments to end up in landfills domestically and internationally. To help alleviate this issue, Clarke-Sather and her team are partnering with True North Goodwill to install a fiber-shredding machine to break down excess garments.\n“This project just keeps getting bigger and bigger,” Durrani said. “It’s cool to be a part of it.”\nDurrani said she hopes the textile industry will eventually adopt this technology broadly, but the machine will have to process more than textile scraps in a minute and a half.\n“The scale of the machine right now cannot handle the amount of textiles that are going into landfills,” Durrani said. “There is a bit of a gap right now. But if we are able to better improve the machine’s design to be able to handle a lot more textiles, I have hope that someday we will see lesser amounts of textile waste ending up in landfills.”\nClarke-Sather shares Durrani’s hopes for the future of the Fiber Shredder and believes her research someday could scale up for commercial use.\n“My advice to researchers and students who want to make an impact on the world is to start looking around,” Clarke-Sather said in the release. “There are so many problems. Just pick one and try to figure out a solution.”\n___\n© 2024 StarTribune\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",
