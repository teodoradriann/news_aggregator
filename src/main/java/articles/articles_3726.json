    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "Though there has never been any shortage of reasons to persecute Jews, the chief one which underlies most others is envy. Had Jews remained a nondescript minority that rarely produced high-flyers, few would have taken much notice of them, but unfortunately for many millions who were done to death simply because they were considered Jews, even if they or their forefathers had become Christians, an unfair proportion has always been exceptionally talented. Naturally enough, their remarkable achievements in so many fields soon greatly annoyed those who found themselves outclassed. In their view, there had to be something sinister about it. Academics, who have always been much given to infighting, fought back by putting quotas, informal or not, on the number of Jews admitted to top universities, a practice which was long followed by Harvard and was recently extended to East Asians. However, it was in 20th-century Germany that envy of Jews reached fever-pitch, with university professors and students eagerly supporting Adolf Hitler’s attempt to rid the world of them all. For many years, Jews were the favourite target of Christian potentates and mobs who accused them of killing Jesus, a charge that was hardly ever levelled against the descendants of the Romans. When theological pretexts for mass murder went out of fashion in Europe, they were replaced by allegedly scientific ones involving race. In some places, their desire to integrate raised hackles, as did their refusal to do so completely by abandoning all their beliefs. Not having a national homeland and therefore being “rootless cosmopolitans” was often held against them; since 1948, possessing one in a region otherwise dominated by Muslims has been used against them by many who never lose a night’s sleep worrying about the terrible fate of the huge numbers of believers being killed every day by their coreligionists in Syria, Yemen, Sudan and many other countries. As a result of the barbarous onslaught by the Jihadists of Hamas – who on October 7 butchered over a thousand Israelis, raping the women and then mutilating their corpses, put babies in ovens and kidnapped hundreds of people as hostages – Western countries have been swept by a tidal wave of anti-Semitism. This may seem contradictory, but even before the Israelis retaliated, some university professors in the United States, accompanied by gangs of student activists, gleefully celebrated the murderous pogrom which they described as the logical reaction of an oppressed people that had been “colonised” by white settlers who, according to them, had established a pitiless “apartheid” regime. For such individuals, the pogrom – the worst since the holocaust perpetrated by the Nazis – was just another episode in the ongoing struggle between “people of colour” and a hateful racist tyranny; they overlook the fact that half the population of Israel has its origin in Jews expelled from Muslim countries and are racially indistinguishable from their former neighbours. As for “apartheid,” it is nonsensical to attach this epithet to a nation state in which members of the Arab minority, who enjoy more freedom than those living in any other Middle Eastern country, sit not just in the parliament – the Knesset – but also on the Supreme Court. In the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, Jews now fear far more for their future than they did at any time in the recent past. In some countries, this can be attributed to the sharp increase of the Mulsim population whose often self-appointed leaders have led huge public demonstrations calling for an end to “genocide” in Gaza. Politicians throughout the West have wavered between trying to appease them by saying they too are worried by the alleged excesses of the Israeli Armed Forces – which are waging war on an enemy which uses civilians as “human shields” and is more than happy to let them die because they know it will help their cause – and their recognition of Israel’s right to defend herself against a savage genocidal foe that openly declares itself determined to slaughter every Jew it can get its hands on. In countries under the sway of anti-Zionist and, in some cases, anti-Semitic politicians such as Spain, Ireland and Norway, governments openly back those who share the Iranian theocrats’ desire to hasten the destruction of the world’s one Jewish State by confronting it now with yet another specifically Muslim one that would make the elimination of the “Zionist entity” its top priority. Needless to say, Hamas leaders can take it for granted that it was thanks to them that those European governments decided to strike a blow against Israel. Even more disturbing than Muslim rage against Jews, is the spread of anti-Semitism among the college population in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in other parts of the world. Many take this to be yet another symptom of a deep malaise that is afflicting most Western countries, a feeling that almost any alternative, even one as uninviting as that represented by Jihadists, would be better than the current status quo. They point out that, in the years that followed World War I, a similar mood among the young made it possible for murderous cults such as Fascism, Nazism and Communism to thrive and prepare the way for the horrendous bloodbath that soon followed. For those who fear something like this could happen again, the Jews are “the canary in the mine” and countries which let them come under attack risk facing a terrifying future.",

    "text": "The northern lights could be visible across most of Canada this week.\nA forecast from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows the dazzling display is expected to reach well below the 49th parallel, creating a high likelihood of aurora activity directly overhead throughout much of B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec and the territories. Northern parts of Ontario, Atlantic Canada and the U.S. are also expected to see the lights.\nThe forecast indicated visibility on Thursday, but further shows are possible through the weekend, some predict.\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App With clear and dark conditions, and an unobstructed view of the northern horizon, aurorae could also be visible further afield in places like southwestern Ontario and Nova Scotia. According to the NOAA, nearly all of Canada lies within tonight's \"view line.\"\nIncreased solar activity this week has already led to colourful displays across the country, including in Alberta , Saskatchewan , Ontario and Quebec .\nThe NOAA classifies the event as four of five geomagnetic storms that could have \"severe\" impacts on power grids, spacecraft operations and satellite navigation systems.\nThe powerful solar storm reached Earth at 11:17 a.m. EDT Thursday.\n\"(The) display will be visible from all of Canada, but for population centres in and east of southern Ontario it will appear towards the northern horizon,\" Ethen Sun, astronomer at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, told CTVNews.ca in an email.\n\"This is quite rare and only in the years where solar activity is the highest does it happen for a few nights.\"\nSun says the different colours are due to coronal mass ejections from the sun colliding with different molecules in the atmosphere. A stronger geomagnetic storm causes more high-altitude collisions producing the normal green colours we see, as well as red and even blue aurorae.\n\"When blended together, just about every colour can be seen as the aurora dances around in the sky,\" Sun said.\nHe recommends anyone wanting to witness the northern lights go somewhere with a clear view to the north and to avoid light pollution.\n\"Keep in mind that because of the high altitude of aurorae, you can be a few hundred kilometres away from the red area (in the NOAA forecast) and still see it,\" Sun said. \"If you live in a downtown area and cannot avoid light pollution, you should be able to see it by taking a photo.\"\nWith files from CNN",
