    "text": "El clima de Texas se tornó severo ayer, registrando tormentas y granizo grande del tamaño de una peseta en el centro sur, señaló el Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (NWS, por sus siglas en inglés), luego de que un sistema de tormentas se estacionara al noreste de San Antonio. En las redes sociales circulan imágenes donde se ve la tormenta que azotó en la ciudad del Álamo, cerca de las 9:00 pm del jueves. Por la noche, el NWS emitió un aviso por tormenta severa en la localidad, por granizo grande y rachas de viento de hasta 50 millas por hora. Te podría interesar Un video en línea mostró granizo del tamaño de una canica en un patio trasero cerca de la intersección de Loop 1604 y Gilbeau Road, golpeando el concreto y rebotando en el suelo. Pronóstico del clima de Texas Según la previsión, el sistema de tormentas se están alejando de San Antonio y sus alrededores, sin embargo, el cielo nublado se mantendrá por un tiempo. Se espera que las precipitaciones paren mínimo hasta el medio día. Luego, por la tarde, se volverán a desarrollar algunas tormentas más, algunas de las cuales podrían volverse brevemente de fuerte a severa. Para este viernes, en San Antonio se espera que el cielo aclare para tener una mañana y tarde despejada, lo cual elevará ligeramente las temperaturas durante el fin de semana. Hoy en la localidad, se espera que el termómetro supere los 80 grados Fahrenheit por la tarde, con vientos de hasta 20 mph, mientras que en la noche, descendería hasta los 55 °F. El sábado la situación no sería muy distinta, con una mañana despejada con intervalos de nubes. El termómetro se colocará en los 78 grados Fahrenheit como temperatura máxima por la tarde, sin embargo, para la noche, el viento comenzará a poblarse de nubes y el termómetro llegará a los 56 °F. El domingo se espera que registre más nubes, con una pequeña probabilidad de lluvia por la noche. La temperatura máxima sería de 78 °F por la tarde, mientras que en la noche el termómetro llegaría a los 63 °F con posibles tormentas eléctricas y vientos del sur y sureste de hasta 20 millas por hora.",

    "title": "California man Marcus Eriz found guilty of killing 6-year-old boy Aiden Leos in road rage incident",
    "text": "(LOS ANGELES) — Marcus Eriz has been found guilty of murder in the Orange County, California, road rage incident that killed 6-year-old Aiden Leos in 2021.\nEriz was convicted of second-degree murder, shooting into an occupied vehicle and two felony enhancements of the personal discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury and death.\n“While we will never know what Aiden would have become, we know that the pursuit of justice did not end until his killer was captured and this child murderer was prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement after the verdict.\nEriz will be sentenced on April 12. The 26-year-old faces 40 years to life in prison.\nOn May 21, 2021, just 10 days after his birthday, Leos was shot and killed sitting in his booster seat while his mother, Joanna Cloonan, was driving him to kindergarten in Yorba Linda.\nDuring Cloonan’s testimony this month, she said her and her son were on the 55 freeway when a white Volkswagen SportWagen cut her off abruptly while she was in the carpool lane driving northbound, according to Los Angeles ABC station KABC.\nCloonan reportedly said she got out of the carpool lane to avoid being behind the car and showed her middle finger in reaction to being cut off. After, a person in the VW opened fire through the rear of Cloonan’s car, striking Aiden in the back seat.\nAfter a weekslong manhunt, authorities arrested then 24-year-old Marcus Eriz, and his girlfriend, Wynne Lee, then 23, at their home in Costa Mesa, California, on June 6, 2021, according to California Highway Patrol.\nInvestigators later determined Lee was driving and Eriz shot at Cloonan’s car that fatal day.\nLee was subsequently charged with being an accessory after the fact and possessing a concealed firearm in a vehicle. Her pretrial hearing is set for Feb. 9. Lee remains free under GPS monitoring on $100,000 bond.\n“They took my son’s life away,” Cloonan told ABC News in an interview on “Good Morning America” in 2021. “He was beautiful and he was kind and he was precious, and you killed him for no reason. And I want to find them and I want there to be justice to be served for my son.”\nDuring her January 2024 testimony, Cloonan tearfully recalled Leos’ final moments after their car was shot at.\n“I heard a noise that sounded like a big rock hit the car,” Cloonan said during the trial, according to KABC-TV. “I heard my son say, ‘Ow.’ I looked behind me and his head was hanging down.”\nCloonan emotionally explained how she tried to save Leos’ life but could tell that her young son was “dying very quickly.”\n“I immediately pulled over to the side of the freeway. I attempted to get him out of his car seat. I noticed that he was dying very quickly. I put my hand on his belly. I put him close to my body to try to save his life and I called 911,” she said, according to KABC.\nDuring her testimony, Cloonan revealed how she discovered what exactly happened during the fatal incident, and that it was a gunshot through her car that took her son’s life.\n“I remember being surrounded. I couldn’t see what was going on with him. I looked at the back of my car and saw a hole. And I asked a man, ‘Is that a bullet hole? Is that what happened?’ And he said, ‘It appears to be so.'”\nLeos was taken to Children’s Hospital of Orange County where he was later pronounced dead.\nWhen Cloonan was shown a photo of Leos during her testimony, she broke down in tears, according to KABC.\nDuring the trial – which began in Orange County on Jan. 18 – prosecutors played a recording of Eriz’s original interrogation with authorities, according to KABC.\nEriz reportedly admitted that “for some reason,” after Cloonen showed her middle finger at him and Lee, he reached into the backseat of their vehicle, pulled out his gun and shot at Cloonen’s car.\nWhen asked what the motive was behind the attack, he reportedly said, “I don’t have an answer. Because I’m stupid. I didn’t think of anything. I didn’t think of the consequences or anyone.”\nEriz claimed he could not remember if he shot at her car from inside his own vehicle or if he shot from outside the passenger door window. Eriz said he did not aim deliberately, according to KABC.\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines — A 59-year-old Filipino priest from Misamis Oriental was recently ordained as an auxiliary bishop in Sacramento, California.\nThe CBCPNews, the official news service provider of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), reported that Rey Bersabal was formally made an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Sacramento during a mass last Friday (Saturday in Manila) at the city’s Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament.\nBersabal was ordained to the episcopate by Bishop Jaime Soto of Sacramento, emeritus Bishop William Weigand and Archbishop Jose Cabantan of Cagayan de Oro as co-consecrators. Also present were 12 bishops and four cardinals, including emeritus Cotabato Archbishop Orlando Cardinal Quevedo.\nBefore the ordination rite, Cardinal Christophe Pierre, apostolic nuncio in the US, read the apostolic letter from Pope Francis, testifying that Bersabal should be ordained bishop.\n“By receiving this new calling… the Lord is asking you to continue the work of a pastor, which has been at the center of your priestly ministry for many years,” Pierre told the new bishop.\nIt was last April 20 when Pope Francis appointed Bersabal as auxiliary bishop of Sacramento.\nIn his homily, Soto emphasized that the title of bishop signifies a task and not an honor, as he encouraged Bersabal to be “faithful steward” of the church entrusted to his care.\nOne of the 12 dioceses in California, Sacramento has a population of around 3.6 million, with more than one million of them Catholics.\nThe diocese encompasses 102 parishes, 40 missions, three Newman Centers, 36 elementary schools and six high schools.\nBersabal urged the diocese’s more than 300 priests and permanent deacons to continue to work “shoulder to shoulder” in guiding and serving their flock.\nBersabal was born in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental, on Oct. 15, 1964. He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro on April 29, 1991 and came to Sacramento in 1999 at the invitation of Bishop Weigand and has since served in various posts.\nBersabal was incardinated into the Sacramento diocese on April 7, 2004.",

    "text": "Australia’s investment in agricultural research and development has reached almost $3 billion in 2023-24, the latest ABARES release has shown.\nThis long-term commitment will lead to improvements in agricultural productivity, sustainability and modernisation.\nThe private sector accounts for the largest growth in investment in the sector, with a nearly 5% annual growth rate from 2005-06.\nABARES executive director, Dr Jared Greenville, said ABARES’s latest data, Agricultural research and development (R&D) investment in Australia – 2023-24 update, found total agricultural R&D funding was increasing steadily, largely from the private sector.\n“Agricultural R&D investment is what underpins innovation in the sector, and the flow-on benefits for farmers are considerable,” said Dr Greenville.\n“We know that every $1 invested in agricultural R&D, generates an almost $8 return for farmers over 10 years, which is a great incentive for the private sector to make these important investments.”\nAccording to ABARES, total agricultural R&D funding has continued to increase gradually, from $2.91 billion in 2022-23 to $2.98 billion in 2023-24.\n“Overall, investment in agricultural R&D is increasing steadily, but we’ve seen the private sector just overtake the public sector as the main funder of agricultural R&D investment,” said Dr Greenville.\n“There is a healthy mix of public and private R&D investment, reflecting a strong and robust innovation system with a good mix of long-term discovery research and practical commercialisation of technology.\n“Private sector investment has the advantage of focussing on commercialising new technologies, so it has far-reaching benefits for Australian farmers.”",
