    "title": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Reportedly 'Live Everywhere Together' Amid Their Busy Schedules",
    "text": "Taylor Swift has been on tour for pretty much the entirety of her relationship with Travis Kelce, but now that things are slowing down a bit on her end, they’ll be able to spend even more quality time together.\nThough both superstars are always on the go, a source told Page Six that they make it a priority to stick together as much as possible. “Taylor and Travis live fairly nomadic lives, and Taylor has home bases everywhere, but they live everywhere together,” the source added.\nSwift is famously always hopping on her private jet (though she’s not even in the top twenty celeb jet users, FWIW) to maintain her cross-country lifestyle, so it sounds like staying with Kelce—whether it be at a hotel, one of her properties, or his Kansas mansion—is their version of cohabitating. However, of all Swift’s properties, the source claims Nashville current serves as a bit of a “home base.”\nRead moreTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce Are in the Joint Christmas Gift Stage of Their Relationship\nSwift’s gift-wrapping skills are unmatched.\n“It also looks like Taylor is going to make Nashville more of a home base than LA or NY since it’s closer to Kansas City, and her mom, Andrea, loves [Nashville] too,” the source said. Taylor Swift went to high school and started her career in the Nashville area, where she already owns multiple properties, so it makes sense as a “home base” during the NFL season, when she travels to Arrowhead Stadium for Kelce’s home games.\n“I think she’s adapted so well to WAG life because she truly understands what it’s like to be part of a team — especially coming off Eras where she formed such a close connection with her band, dancers, singers and crew,” said the source.\nClearly, things are serious between the two. We recently learned that they’re in the “joint gift giving” stage of their relationship, and they looked so dang sweet at her Eras Tour wrap party. When he gave her the “22” hat? Adorbs. Heck, I’d move in with that boy, too.\nRead moreTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce Clearly Had a Marvelous Time at Her Eras Tour Wrap Party\nWhat a way to end an era.",

A year and a half ago, they faced a large problem. The vault was at 90% capacity. They were running out of room. Today, thanks to a year-long $1 million renovation, they have some room to breathe. The work included an updated sprinkler system, covering over two windows to block out damaging sunlight and replacing all of the shelving with high-density storage shelving. That’s a large undertaking. Everything had to be removed from the vault and put into storage; almost 7,000 boxes. Once the new shelving was in place those boxes all had to be returned to their very specific locations. The new shelving increases the storage space from 9,000 cubic feet to over 13,000 cubic feet — a total of 2.64 miles of shelves. Copyright 2024 KTUU. All rights reserved.",

(WKYT) - Parts of Raven Run Nature Sanctuary in Lexington can be difficult to traverse for anybody, but now, with the help of a new all-terrain wheelchair, some of the most beautiful hiking trails that are hard to get to can be experienced by everyone.\nThe Action Trackchair gives people who have issues with mobility the ability to enjoy nature no matter how rough the terrain.\n“It’s been so much that has not been available to the people who have mobility issues at Raven Run,” said Adrienne Thakur, the Deputy Director of Recreation at Lexington Parks and Recreation. “The ability to go off into the fully forested area and experience the wildlife and the plants and the wildflowers to take a forest bath and get completely away from the man-made entities and buildings in the park.”\nA team within Lexington’s Park and Rec advocated for the trackchair for many years after some in the public wanted more trail accessibility.\nThe city paid $19,000 for this vehicle, and it comes with several safety features, including seat belts, an emergency stop and an anti-rollback device.\n“Our staff at Raven Run has done a great job of mapping the trail to make sure the chair can be used safely and appropriately on the routes that are chosen,” said Thakur.\nKristy Stambaugh is the city’s Director of Aging and Disability Services.\n“It’s really nice and responsive,” Stambaugh said. “I think as we get older, we say, ‘Gosh, I wish I could... I wish I could go through the meadow at Raven Run. Oh, but I’m worried about the mole holes. I’m worried about the rocks or I’m worried about the terrain,’ and so this track chair is going to open that up because it’s going to take away that worry.”\nStambaugh says she’ll let the seniors she serves know about this Trackchair, but there might be a waiting list for reservations. This is the only one available, but there are discussions to purchase another one.\nThe Action Trackchair is free to use.\nReservation times can be found here.\nCopyright 2025 WKYT.

    "text": "House where four UI students were murdered demolished by construction crews on Thursday Original story by CBS affiliate KREM 2 News MOSCOW, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) — Early Thursday morning construction crews in Moscow started to tear down the house where four University of Idaho students were murdered and some of the victim’s family members have spoken out. CBS affiliate KREM 2 News in Spokane, Washington reports the demolition of the house, which has been guarded by security since November of 2022, marked a significant but emotional moment for the victims’ families and the wider University of Idaho community. According to KREM, Maddie Mogen’s father, Ben Mogen, voiced his support for the university’s choice to tear down the residence, expressing his reluctance to let anyone else occupy the home. Conflicting sentiments emerged from the Goncalves and Kernodle families, urging Latah County prosecutors and the university to halt the demolition until after the trial. They emphasized the need for a trial date, advocating for justice to be served before the house’s removal. Jodi Walker, a spokesperson for the University of Idaho, highlighted the institution’s collaboration with both prosecution and defense. “It’s been a constant reminder of the horrific act there. Uh, we’ll certainly not forget what happened there, but not having that daily physical reminder is helpful for the healing of our community.” Walker says when the demolition is complete, the university will plant grass on the property and the lot will remain vacant for the foreseeable future. Prosecutors hope to try Kohberger next summer. Recent statements by the Latah County Prosecuting Attorney have shed light on the situation, indicating that the current state of the premises no longer aligns with the condition at the time of the homicides, suggesting a jury view would not be warranted. The University of Idaho announced demolition plans when the homeowner gifted the house to the university, and the UI had previously planning to demolish it before the 2023-2024 academic year.

    "text": "Ahmedabad has recorded more than 10 inches of unseasonal rainfall in just three days, throwing the city into chaos. The State Emergency Department in Gandhinagar released data showing heavy showers with strong winds and thunderstorms since Monday.\nDespite being May, the city feels more like winter than summer. On Wednesday, Ahmedabad’s maximum temperature dropped to a mere 26.9°C—14.6°C below normal for this time of year. The minimum temperature hovered at 21.2°C, 5.5°C lower than average. The city logged 31.1 mm of rainfall within 24 hours by Tuesday evening. Humidity remained surprisingly high at 96 percent in the morning, falling to 72 percent by evening. Cloudy skies, steady rain and cool winds have transformed the normally scorching city into something unrecognisable for May.\nRainfall across districts\nRain has pounded the entire Ahmedabad division. Monday saw 1.42 inches across the city. Between Tuesday 6 am and Wednesday 6 am, another 2.52 inches fell. Viramgam received 0.83 inches, while Ahmedabad Mandal got 0.57 inches. Detroj-Rampura recorded 0.20 inches, Bavla 0.12 inches, and Dholka 0.08 inches. On Wednesday alone, between 6 am and 4 pm, the city was drenched with a staggering 7.21 inches. Bavla followed with 2.72 inches, Dholera 1.85 inches, and Dholka 1.30 inches. Sanand, Daskroi and Dhandhuka got 0.55 and 0.08 inches.\nTraffic chaos ensues\nSevere waterlogging has brought many parts of Ahmedabad to a standstill. Service lanes along SG Highway–132 Ft Ring Road and areas near GMDC Ground are completely underwater. In Ghatlodia’s Janta Nagar, an AMC garbage truck got stuck in a hidden pothole. Cars in Gota smashed into submerged dividers on the SG Highway service lane. Similar scenes unfolded on Pakwan Road and near Binori Hotel, where abandoned vehicles sat half-submerged.\nStorm damage mounts\nShivranjani Crossroads reported waterlogging on the service road towards IIM-A. The Vejalpur–Makarba road saw an electric pole upended by fierce winds and rain, creating serious safety risks for locals and drivers alike.\nRed alert over deluge\nThe IMD has slapped a red alert on Ahmedabad and nearby districts. The warning covers heavy to very heavy rain, thunderstorms, and winds up to 70 kmph in isolated spots. Anand, Bhavnagar, Valsad, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli are also under red alert.\nBhavnagar worst hit\nThe deluge has hit other parts of Gujarat hard too. Bhavnagar (Mahuva) and Anand have taken the worst beating. Most of Gujarat, including Saurashtra and Kutch, has seen widespread rainfall. North Gujarat experienced the sharpest temperature drop during daylight hours. Southern Gujarat and coastal areas of Saurashtra and Kutch have also remained much cooler than normal.\nRainy till May 14\n“The forecast shows that Ahmedabad and many parts of Gujarat will continue to receive rain till at least May 14,” said an IMD official. “Light to moderate showers with gusty winds are expected across the state over the next three days.” “Rain may ease off slightly by the weekend,” the official added, “but thunderstorms and strong winds will likely continue in some areas.”\nColour-coded warnings\nA red alert has been sounded for Ahmedabad, Anand, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Valsad, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli.",

    "title": "Da'Vine Joy Randolph’s ‘Idol’ Costumes Came From Her Own Closet",
    "text": "Da'Vine Joy Randolph’s ‘Idol’ Costumes Came From Her Own Closet One of the best things about HBO’s [The Idol ](https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/the-idol-cast-reacts-to-backlash-controversial-sex-scenes/)is Da’Vine Joy Randolph and her wardrobe. Throughout the season, Randolph’s Destiny — the no nonsense manager of pop star Jocelyn (Lily-Rose Depp) — was a fierce sight in black leather trench coats, Gucci corsets, platform heels and structural sunglasses. She’d team the pieces with statement jewelry, bold glam and intricate hairdos. Her bold style perfectly complemented Destiny’s she-means-business aura and inspired the shopping carts of fans who tuned in every week — and as it turns out, “most” of those outfits came from Randolph’s own closet. “A lot of times, you know, TV moves fast, and also because I’m specialty size,” Randolph told [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/27/1197955846/its-been-a-minute-davine-joy-randolph-oscars-matriarch) in a Tuesday, February 27, interview, explaining why she chose to purchase her own pieces for the show. “Sometimes it was like, ‘We don’t have time to custom make this or that.’ No problem. I got it in my closet. No problem. I went ahead and bought it,” she added. [Style File: This Week in Looks](https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/style-file-2024-this-weeks-best-red-carpet-looks/) Randolph’s off-camera style is just as good as what she wears on the big and small screen. At the 2024 [Independent Spirit Awards](https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/the-best-red-carpet-fashion-at-the-2024-independent-spirit-awards/) on February 25, Randolph was a must-see in a burgundy satin dress under a coordinating leather coat made custom by Da Shoné By DaSh. She paired the getup with gold sandal heels and dangling earrings. For the Screen Actors Guild Awards on February 24, she was a walking bouquet in a bespoke champagne-colored Valdrin Sahiti gown. A few days prior, at the [BAFTAs](https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/the-best-fashion-from-the-2024-baftas-what-the-stars-wore/), she looked like royalty in a Robert Wun creation that featured gathered peach fabric at the bodice that fell into a cascading train. Of course, Randolph’s fashion isn’t the only reason she’s making headlines this awards season. She’s been victorious over the last several weeks, taking home a Golden Globe, a Critics’ Choice Award and a BAFTA for her role as Mary in The Holdovers. [The Best Red Carpet Fashion From the 2024 SAG Awards](https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/the-best-fashion-from-the-2024-sag-awards-what-the-stars-wore/) “I wake up every day overwhelmed with gratitude, to be a working actor,” she said in her SAG Award acceptance speech. “To be awarded this by my fellow artists is the greatest honor of my career. I also want to take a moment to say that every role that I have ever played, has been crafted thanks to those who are nearest and dearest to me. Some of the most brilliant actors I know whose talents have yet to be properly acknowledged by the world.” She was also announced as an Oscar nominee ahead of the March 10 ceremony.",

    "title": "NBA: Wembanyama se perderá el resto de la temporada con Spurs",
    "text": "La temporada de Victor Wembanyama con los San Antonio Spurs podría haber llegado a su fin tras ser diagnosticado con un coágulo de sangre en su hombro derecho. La noticia representa un duro revés para la franquicia y la NBA, pues el joven francés se había consolidado como una de las estrellas emergentes más impactantes del baloncesto profesional.\nSegún fuentes cercanas al equipo, el pívot de 2,21 metros de altura comenzará tratamiento de inmediato, y aunque se espera su recuperación total, los Spurs manejan la situación con cautela. Su participación en futuras competencias, como el campeonato europeo con Francia, dependerá de la evolución de su estado de salud y la recomendación médica. Lea: Colombia se juega la clasificación a la AmeriCup 2025 ante Chile\nWemby con trombosis venesa\nEl diagnóstico de trombosis venosa profunda, una condición tratada con anticoagulantes, suele ser un obstáculo para los deportistas de contacto debido al alto riesgo de sangrado. A pesar de esto, Wembanyama ha mostrado una actitud optimista y, según fuentes, mantiene la esperanza de volver a las canchas en el menor tiempo posible.\nLa ausencia de Wembanyama es un golpe doble para los Spurs, que ya sufrieron otro revés en noviembre cuando su entrenador, Gregg Popovich, tuvo que ausentarse temporalmente tras sufrir un derrame cerebral. Esta situación pone a prueba la capacidad de adaptación de un equipo que ha tenido dificultades para encontrar estabilidad en la temporada.\nEn su segunda temporada en la liga, Wembanyama ha impresionado con estadísticas que lo colocan en la élite de la NBA: 24,3 puntos, 11 rebotes, 3,8 tapones y 3,7 asistencias por partido. Su impacto defensivo es tal que se perfila como el principal candidato al premio al Jugador Defensivo del Año, lo que hace aún más notoria su ausencia. Lea: John Durán reaparecería este viernes con el Al Nassr\nA medida que avanza su recuperación, los Spurs deberán buscar nuevas estrategias para afrontar el resto de la temporada sin su estrella. Mientras tanto, la comunidad del baloncesto estará atenta a su evolución, esperando que Wembanyama pueda regresar a la duela en plenitud de condiciones y continuar con su meteórico ascenso en la NBA.",
