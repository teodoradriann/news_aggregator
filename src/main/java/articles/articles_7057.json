    "text": "Descubre lo que dice la neurociencia del silencio total para tu bienestar\nDormir bien no es solo cuestión de horas, sino de calidad del descanso. Y en ese camino hacia el sueño reparador, el silencio total podría ser una herramienta clave. La ciencia ahora sugiere que el uso de tapones para dormir no solo mejora la calidad del sueño, sino también tiene un impacto directo en tu memoria a corto y largo plazo.\nUn reciente estudio publicado en Cell Reports reveló que las personas que dormían con tapones en los oídos durante al menos una semana mostraban mejoras significativas en tareas cognitivas vinculadas a la retención de información y al aprendizaje. ¿La razón? El cerebro, al estar libre de estímulos sonoros, alcanza fases más profundas del sueño, especialmente el sueño REM y el sueño profundo, fundamentales para procesar recuerdos.\nAdemás de ser una herramienta accesible, los tapones ayudan a bloquear el ruido ambiental —tráfico, vecinos, ronquidos— que interrumpe el descanso sin que lo notes. Dormir en silencio se convierte así en un biohack natural para cuidar tu salud mental y tu capacidad cognitiva.\nCada vez más expertos en neurociencia del sueño y bienestar los recomiendan como una alternativa sencilla para quienes buscan mejorar su enfoque, memoria y rendimiento diario. Y lo mejor: no necesitas tecnología de última generación, solo un par de buenos tapones.\nSi quieres un cerebro más despierto, empieza por dormir mejor. Y el silencio podría ser tu mejor aliado. @mundiario",

    "text": "“She gave me life twice”; Mom and daughter graduate nursing school together after kidney transplants\nBATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Nija Butler knew she had a special bond with her daughter, Ambrealle, the day she was born.\n“I had her when I was in high school, so we grew up together basically as siblings,” said Nija. “She’s my best friend, she’s my confidante.”\nGrowing up, Ambrealle was a normal, healthy child. That all changed at a routine checkup in her late 20s\n“I was so young at the time, so I had forever, or so I thought,” said Ambrealle.\nThe doctors found one of her kidneys spilling too much protein and decided to run more tests to see what was going on.\n“We went back in to get the results, and he pretty much said you won’t live if you don’t get a kidney or dialysis,” recalled Ambrealle.\nThey diagnosed her with a rare kidney disease called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, which can lead to total kidney failure.\n“I can basically say that was the worst day ever,” admitted Nija. “I felt helpless listening to the doctor saying you won’t live. That was just something I never thought I would hear for my child.”\nHearing this made Ambrealle sad, mad and scared. Both she and her mother were devasted.\n“As a mother, you want to be the person that can fix anything that’s going on for your child and at that moment I knew there was nothing I could do,” said Nija.\nAll Ambrealle could do was start dialysis and get on a wait list for a kidney transplant. Every day for the next five years, she spent up to 13 hours a day hooked up to her machine.\n“That was scary knowing that this tube is keeping me alive,” said Ambrealle.\nAlthough it was tough for Nija to watch, she was by her daughter’s side every step of the way.\n“Watching her go through that and experience that, sometimes I would get into bed with her while she was on dialysis because that’s all I could do,” said Nija.\nUntil one day, Nija decided she had to do more.\n“Ambrealle called me, and she was having one of her bad days and she was crying, and it was just in my gut that I needed to see because I really felt like I was helpless,” admitted Nija. “Even though I was being told that I probably wouldn’t be a match, I just said all they can do is tell me yes or no.”\nWithout telling her daughter, Nija got tested to see if she could donate one of her kidneys. Doctors told her the chance of it being a good match were highly unlikely, but not impossible. A few days after the tests, Tulane called Nija and told her she was a perfect match.\n“It was probably like the best news I’ve ever heard in my life because I waited for that call for so long and I didn’t even know she was doing it,” said Ambrealle.\nA few weeks later, Ambrealle and Nija were getting prepped for surgery at Tulane Medical Center. Nija’s surgery went first and after Ambrealle’s, she spent two days in ICU before she could finally see her mom.\n“When she came in, she was limping, she had all her IV poles with her, she just couldn’t take it anymore,” said Ambrealle.\nNija said she couldn’t take not seeing her daughter any longer.\n“All I could do was kiss her, hug her, and I just wanted to touch her to make sure she was okay,” recalled Nija. “I always felt like when she was going through this, that I couldn’t breathe. It was like holding my breath while she went through this process so when I saw her and the doctors told me that the kidney was working well, I gave her a perfect kidney, it was like I could breathe.”\nAmbrealle felt the same way.\n“She gave birth to me, and she gave me a second chance at life, so she gave me life twice,” said Ambrealle.\nWith her second chance at life, Ambrealle wanted to chase her dream of becoming a registered nurse, but not alone of course.\n“We both applied, and I got in, and she didn’t,” said Nija. “I told her, ‘Well I’m not going if you’re not going!’”\nAmbrealle wasn’t going to let her do that though.\n“I told her no, when it’s my time, I’ll know, you go ahead without me and don’t worry,” said Ambrealle. “But the day before school started, they called me and asked if I could be in class the next morning.”\nThey started a 16-month registered nurse program at Baton Rouge General School of Nursing together. Through long study hours, tests, and labs, the thought of being able to give back kept Ambrealle going.\n“We’re taught book-wise how the kidney works, how dialysis works, but imagine your nurse is coming in who has been where you’re sitting and I know what you’re feeling,” said Ambrealle.\nNow, she’s going to get that chance. Her and her mom are set to walk across the graduation stage together at the end of April and start their careers helping others.\n“Knowing that she’s going to branch out on her own and that I’m going to branch out, that’s scary for me because this is my best friend and I hope nothing changes,” said Nija.\n“She’s not going to allow anything to change I mean she calls me every five minutes haha so whether I’m branching out or not, I’m not going to be far,” said Ambrealle. “I’m glad to do life with you and I love you.”\nNija and Ambrealle said they have big plans of starting their own business together and continuing to help other kidney patients and their families.\nClick here to report a typo.

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "Late in 2024 , scientists announced they had discovered world-record levels of toxic \"forever chemicals\" in a New Mexico lake. Their newest study confirmed the results and analyzed the factors that contributed to this contamination. The research expanded on the first study to examine PFAS contamination in the waters of Holloman Lake along with soils, plants, algae, fish, reptiles, and various species of birds and mammals, according to a summary from the University of New Mexico published by Phys.org . All the samples had very high PFAS concentrations, up to or exceeding 10,000 times what the Environmental Protection Agency recommends in its drinking water standards. Lake waters showed the highest concentration of PFAS anywhere in the world to date, as did one plant composite sample. The team also discovered the highest PFAS concentration recorded in a bird to date. The scientists found that the contamination extends beyond the lake itself, and they linked this to past flooding events. For instance, the most contaminated soil sample was located downstream from the lake. In the past, water from the lake sometimes flowed past a dam and into a network of playas — \"shallow, generally circular, depressions with clay-lined basins\" that \"form at the lowest point in an enclosed watershed\" and often serve as temporary lakes, according to the university. The scientists don't know how contaminated the playas in the area might be but stated that they can serve as important habitats for migratory birds. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances have been linked to a number of health concerns , including decreased fertility, increased risk of cancer, and reduced ability of the body's immune system to fight infections. The scientists are worried that migratory birds will become heavily contaminated at Holloman Lake and then move on to other areas, putting hunters and people elsewhere at risk. They also recorded a herd of oryx — a nonnative African big-game species that was released in the region from 1969 and 1977 — visiting the lake to drink and are worried that hunters could ingest contaminated meat. Do you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home? Majorly Sometimes Not really I don't know enough about them Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. The Santa Fe New Mexican added that consuming just one bite of meat from a Holloman Lake duck would expose someone to more PFAS than is recommended for a lifetime. \"We are worried about the possibility of toxicity on reproduction and development in local birds, some of them sensitive species like the snowy plover,\" study lead author Jean-Luc Cartron said . \"Contamination by PFAS could also be transgenerational, with contamination affecting not just animals living at or visiting Holloman Lake but also future generations.\" Though Holloman is the most PFAS-laden lake discovered so far, there are a number of other large water bodies contaminated with these chemicals. For instance, one study found forever chemicals all over the Great Lakes Basin, including in air, rain, and water. In January, the New Mexico Department of Health issued an advisory for anyone who has eaten or captured wildlife from Holloman Lake in the past decade, urging them to speak to their medical provider. Hunting has been prohibited there since 2024. And though PFAS are known for being difficult to remove from the environment, scientists have made breakthroughs, which could help safeguard people and wildlife in the future. For instance, researchers at the University of Illinois found a way to remove the full spectrum of PFAS from water in a single process, and a team at the University of Rochester is doing similar work.

    "text": "La primera gran entrega de premios 2024 está a unas horas de realizarse y México podrá ser parte de ella. Los Globos de Oro , donde la prensa extranjera en EU reconoce a lo mejor del cine y la tv, se realizará el próximo domingo 7 luego de que el fantasma de la huelga actoral en Hollywood acabara hace una semanas y, con ello, la inasistencia de nominados a la ceremonia.\nEn esta ocasión no hay ningún mexicano nominado, pero si hay presencia de latinos que vale la pena seguir.\nDÓNDE VER\nTNT comenzará transmisión de la alfombra roja, por la cual desfilarán actores y actrices nominados, a las 18:00 horas\nPoco después, tanto TNT como HBO-Max, comenzarán la transmisión de la ceremonia de premiación, programada para las 19:00 horas\nLee también: Muere a los 80 años David Soul, actor de \"Starsky y Hutch\"\nPOR SI NO TUVISTE TIEMPO\nTan pronto termine la gala nocturna y si no tuviste oportunidad de verla en vivo, HBO-Max la tendrá disponible en su plataforma para suscriptores. La misma estará por espacio de tres meses, así que no tendrán pretexto para decir que no la viste.\nLAS MÁS NOMINADAS\nEl fenómeno \"Barbenheimer \" que prácticamente hizo revivir los años prepandémicos en cuando a asistencia a salas y poder mediático, también lideran la entrega 2024 de los llamados Golden Globes.\nMientras “Barbie” tiene nueve nominaciones, incluidas Mejor Película Comedia o Musical, así como Mejor Actriz (Margot Robbie); “Oppenheimer” llega con ocho, entre ellas Mejor Película Drama y Mejor Actor (Cillian Murphy).\nFoto: Twitter Y “Los asesinos de la luna”, de Martín Scorsese, está considerada en siete categorías, siendo algunos de sus nominados el propio cineasta, así como integrantes de su elenco como Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro y Emily Blunt.\nEn cuanto a serie, “Sucession” es la serie con más nominaciones (nueve), teniendo enfrente a otras también fuertes al menos en el gusto del público, como “The Crown” y “The last of Us”.\nLA NUEVA CATEGORÍA\nEste año se sumó la categoría Mejor Logro Cinematográfico y de Taquilla, en la que fueron consideradas ocho producciones. Además de las ya esperadas “Barbie” y “Oppenheimer”, se suman entre otras la animada “Super Mario Bros, la película”; las nuevas entregas de “John Wick” y “Misión imposible”, así como la cantante Taylor Switf con su presentación musical cinematográfica “The Eras Tour”.\nLOS PRESENTADORES\nEl comediante Jo Koy (“Mansión embrujada”) será el anfitrión de la velada que incluirá entre los presentadores a Amanda Seyfred, Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera y Florence Pugh.\nLAS CURIOSIDADES\nBradley Cooper está nominado a Dirección y Actor por su trabajo en “Maestro”, algo que es difícil de compaginar.\nY Emma Stone está en ambos mundos del cine y la tv. Por un lado fue considerada como Actriz en Musical o Comedia por el filme “Pobres criaturas” y, por otro, como Actriz Dramática por la serie “The curse”.\nLee también: Hace 17 años, Anahí refrigeró un pastel que prometió descongelar en 2024\nLOS LATINOS\nEl actor chileno Pedro Pascal se encuentra en la categoría de Mejor Actor Series Drama por su protagónico en la apocalíptica “The last of Us”, la cual también compite en la máxima categoría de Drama.\nSelena Gómez es estadounidense, pero tiene raíces mexicanas por su padre. La también cantante de 31 años está considerada en la categoría de Mejor Actriz Series Musical o Comedia por su trabajo en “Only murders in the building” .\nEl mexicano Cristo Fernández no está nominado, pero sí la serie “Ted Lasso”, donde es una de las figuras principales. La producción con temática futbolera está como Mejor Serie Musical o Drama, al lado de otras como “The bear” y “Barry”.\nFoto: Instagram @selenagomez Lee también: Michelle Rodríguez: Aplauden y critican su discurso y su nuevo aspecto físico\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.",

    "text": "Florian Tudor, considerado el líder de la llamada mafia rumana, dedicada a la trata de personas y clonación de tarjetas bancarias a escala internacional, se quejó de malos tratos e incomunicación en el penal de máxima seguridad del Altiplano, en el estado de México, donde permanece privado de la libertad desde 2021, cuando fue detenido por personal de la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR), por delitos de delincuencia organizada, extorsión y tentativa de homicidio agravado.\nEl presunto delincuente promovió un nuevo juicio de amparo ante el Juzgado Tercero de Distrito en Materias de Amparo y Juicios Federales en el estado de México, quien le concedió la suspensión de plano contra los actos privativos de la libertad e incomunicación.\nEn su demanda Florian Tudor manifestó problemas de salud como consecuencia de supuestos actos de tortura ocurridos en agosto pasado. Sin embargo, el juez señaló que no estima ni advierte que se encuentre comprometida su integridad y dignidad personal de manera grave, “pues no se observó que se ponga en riesgo su salud y/o su vida dado que no se evidencia la pérdida o menoscabo de alguna capacidad física u orgánica, y menos aún que se ubique en un riesgo previsible o inminente de pérdida de la vida”.\nEl togado dijo que igualmente, no se inadvierten las manifestaciones relativas a que no se le ha brindado el servicio de tienda, ni clases de licenciatura, así como que no ha recibido correspondencia de su familia; no obstante, dijo que se reserva acordar lo conducente hasta en tanto el quejoso presente la información donde afirma lo anterior.\nRespecto a las manifestaciones de Tudor donde refiere “temer seguir siendo torturado y que en sus revisiones se le obligue a desnudarse completamente, así como seguir siendo molestado por personal de seguridad del centro de reclusión en que se encuentra”, el juez le recordó que en agosto de este año también se le otorgó una suspensión de oficio y de plano respecto de los actos reclamados (golpes, tortura, malos tratos consistentes en discriminación y falta de atención medica); lo cual, agregó, las autoridades responsables se encuentran obligadas a su cumplimiento.\nAsimismo, el juez dio a conocer que el director general y presidente del comité técnico y director de custodia penitenciaria, ambos del Centro Federal de Readaptación Social Número 1, El Altiplano, con residencia en Almoloya de Juárez, estado de México, rindió su informe relativo al cumplimiento de la suspensión de oficio y de plano.",
