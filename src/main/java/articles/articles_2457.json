    "title": "North Korea's Kim preparing for war with US, steps up nuclear sector",
    "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered his nation's industrial and military sectors to prepare for war with the United States, citing \"unprecedented\" confrontational activity by the U.S. and its allies. Kim, speaking at a 2024 planning meeting Wednesday of his ruling Workers' Party, said an in-depth analysis indicated the \"severe political and military situation\" on the Korean peninsula had \"reached its limit,\" the state-run news agency reported Thursday. The news agency said the military-industrial sector, nuclear weapons sector and civil defense sector were urged to \"further accelerate the completion of preparations for this war.\"\nKim's statements continue a pattern of threatening rhetoric in recent months. They come less than two weeks after the White House \"reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to provide extended deterrence\" against Pyongyang and dismissed no military options − including nuclear.\n\"Any nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime,\" the White House statement said, warning that any nuclear attack targeting South Korea would be \"met with a swift, overwhelming, and decisive response.\"\nLast month, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit after two previous failed attempts. The U.S. and its allies consider the satellite a breach of United Nations Security Council resolutions. On Wednesday, Kim pledged to expand cooperative relations with \"independent, anti-imperialist countries in preparation for the rapidly changing international political landscape.\"\nSouth Korea bracing for more provocations South Korea's spy agency said Thursday that Kim was likely to carry out military provocations ahead of major elections in South Korea and the United States in 2024. The National Intelligence Service cited North Korea's track record of staging provocations before general elections in South Korea. Kim also has recently reinstated key figures involved in high-profile provocations against Seoul, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.\nSouth Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday ordered troops not to wait for orders to retaliate in the event of an attack, saying the military \"should smash the enemy's desire for provocations immediately,\" Yonhap reported.\nIs North Korea preparing for war? It's a 'real possibility' Harry Kazianis, senior director of National Security Affairs at the Center for the National Interest − a conservative, Washington-based public policy think tank − told USA TODAY he is concerned that war with North Korea could become a \"real possibility.\"\nPyongyang has been working on tactical nuclear weapons for years, and just testing them could spark a crisis with Washington and Seoul, Kazianis said. He added that North Korea could test an intercontinental ballistic missile by sending it thousands of miles into the Pacific Ocean to ensure its missiles can indeed reach the U.S.\nNorth Korea has bolstered ties with Russia Kim has strengthened ties with Russia in recent months, and he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, a Russian spaceport, in September. Putin has been scrambling to arm his war against Ukraine, and last month U.S. authorities said Pyongyang had shipped more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia.\nKim knows US is tied up with 2024 elections Kim believes he can make his provocations and \"never pay a price\" because China and Russia are fully in the North Korean camp due to tensions with Washington, Kazianis said.\n\"The Kim family also knows that in 2024 America will be looking inward toward its presidential election, giving them the room to cause chaos and feel no pain,\" he said.",

    "text": "Strong solar flare seen in dazzling image on New Year’s Eve (Gray News) - 2023 ended with an incredible light show from space. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory [captured a spectacular image](https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2023/12/31/strong-solar-flare-erupts-from-sun-8/) of a strong solar flare erupting from the sun Sunday afternoon. The close-up image of the sun shows a mix of yellow, orange, brown and black colors. A bright white flash that appears on the left side of the photo is the solar flare, which peaked at 4:55 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday. NASA said the flare is classified as an X5.0 flare, with X-class being flares of the highest intensity. Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy made of extremely hot solar material. Flares and solar eruptions, while beautiful, can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals and even pose a risk to spacecraft and astronauts. The space agency said it constantly monitors the sun and space, studying solar activity, the solar atmosphere, particles and the Earth’s magnetic field. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "NASA astronaut rescued from ISS says virtual church fellowship sustained him: 'Vital'\nOne of the NASA astronauts who recently returned to Earth after being stuck at the International Space Station for more than nine months said earlier this week that remotely attending church services sustained him spiritually while lingering in orbit.\nBarry \"Butch\" Wilmore said during a Monday press conference in Houston with fellow astronaut Suni Williams that maintaining virtual fellowship with Providence Baptist Church — his home church in Pasadena, Texas — was \"vital\" while their originally planned eight-day trip to the ISS dragged out for 286 days amid technical issues.\nWilmore, an elder at the church he has attended with his family for 17 years, led devotionals and joined fellow astronauts in singing \"Amazing Grace,\" he told CBN in a recent interview.\nAstronaut Butch Wilmore says that watching church services every week while he was stuck in space for 9 months is what sustained him. He said, “The Word of God continually infilling me—I need it.” He’s absolutely right, and we all need it! Watch...\n— Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham)[pic.twitter.com/EJPQ2P6wAt][April 2, 2025]\nDuring the Monday press briefing, he said he also streamed services from Grace Baptist Church in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, where one of his friends is a pastor and elder.\n\"The Word of God continually infilling me, I need it,\" Wilmore said when asked why attending services from space was important to him. \"My pastors are the finest pastors on — or off, in this case — the planet. And to tie in and to worship with my church family was vital. I mean, it's part of what makes me go.\"\nNoting how people's lives are \"bound up in many things,\" Wilmore said, \"For me, it's faith in my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He is the end-all, be-all. He forgives us.\"\n\"He teaches us when He says in His Word about being content in all situations because He's working out His plan and His purposes for His glory and our good, and I believe that because the Bible says that.\"\n\"It doesn't mean always happy, it doesn't mean there's no pain, but content and knowing that God's in control; a sovereign God's in control, working out His plan and His purpose,\" Wilmore added regarding contentment.\n\"Who's lived a life without pain? I mean, no one. That's the nature of existence. Who's lived a life without sorrow? Who's lived a life without challenges? It grows us, we learn from it, and that's the focus that I try to take from it: What's the Lord trying to show me?\"\nPastor Tommy Dohn at Providence Baptist Church said Wilmore's home congregation was excited to see him when he returned in person, according to KPRC.\n\"There was a bit of excitement after he came, but he doesn't want to be the focus,\" Dohn said. \"Although we are all kind of starstruck.\"\nWith the help of the SpaceX Dragon capsule, the astronauts returned from the ISS on March 18.\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has claimed the Biden administration declined his offer to help retrieve the crew to avoid giving the outspoken Trump supporter an optics victory during election season.\nDuring the press conference upon their return, Wilmore was diplomatic when asked if he ever felt stuck, stranded or marooned.\n\"Any of those adjectives, they're very broad in their definition,\" Wilmore said.\n\"So in certain respects, we were stuck, in certain respects, maybe we were stranded, but based on how they were couching this, that we were left and forgotten in orbit, we were nowhere near any of that at all.\"\nWhile in orbit, Wilmore previously said that what Musk said \"is absolutely factual,\" though he noted he was unaware of the particulars of any closed-door meetings regarding their ordeal.\nJon Brown is a reporter for The Christian Post.

The suspects, including three alleged senior IS militants, were detained in raids carried out at dawn in nine provinces across Turkey, Anadolu Agency reported, citing unnamed security sources. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel They were detained in a joint operation by the country's intelligence agency and police, the agency said. The arrests come a week after police rounded up 304 suspected IS militants in simultaneous raids across Turkey in what appeared to be a security sweep leading up to the New Year festivities. The Islamic State group has carried out a string of deadly attacks in Turkey, including a shooting at an Istanbul night club on January 1, 2017, that killed 39 people during New Year celebrations.

    "text": "Estados Unidos .- Después del éxito de Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem , queda claro que Paramount tiene la intención de expandir esta franquicia a nuevos territorios, y eso incluye una película solo para adultos . Así es, esta será la primera vez desde su concepción que las Tortugas Ninja tendrán una aventura que no es apta para menores de edad , puesto que ya está en desarrollo una adaptación live action de The Last Ronin .\nDe acuerdo con The Hollywood Reporter , Paramount ha dado luz verde a una adaptación de The Last Ronin, la cual será una película live action con la clasificación R . Tyler Burton Smith , quien co-escribió Boy Kills World , está escribiendo el guion , mientras que Walter Hamada , por medio de su compañía 18hz , será el productor .\nPara aquellos que no han leído The Last Ronin, este es un cómic de IDW comics, el cual nos presenta un futuro distópico en donde el nieto de Shredder logró asesinar a Splinter, así como a tres de las cuatro Tortugas , dejando a un miembro de esta familia en una misión de venganza . Uno de los puntos más intrigrantes de la obra original, es que no estaba claro cuál héroe había sobrevivido . Si bien este misterio eventualmente tuvo una respuesta, es muy probable que la adaptación aún mantenga este elemento presente.\nEl éxito de The Last Ronin fue tan grande, que este mismo año se lanzó el primer tomo de TMNT: The Last Ronin II – Re-Evolution , una secuela que se ha convertido en uno de los cómics más exitosos de 2024 . De esta forma, las expectativas por la película son bastante altas, especialmente por los fans de los cómics de IDW.\nAunque por el momento no hay actores y un director relacionados con esta adaptación, Walter Hamada es reconocido por su trabajo como expresidente de DC Films , así como por sobrellevar las series The Conjuring y las nuevas películas de It. Ahora, considerando el gran potencial de The Last Ronin, muchos esperan que esta adaptación logre rendirle honor al trabajo original, incluso si algunos no están de acuerdo con una adaptación live action.\nJunto a The Last Ronin, sabemos que Paramount también está trabajando en una serie animada de Mutant Mayhem, así como una secuela de esta cinta.\nInformación de Atomix",

    "text": "Stock Market Today: New Record High Within Reach for S&P 500\nThe main benchmarks notched modest gains in the penultimate trading session of 2023, putting the S&P 500 within striking distance of a new all-time high.\nVolume continues to taper off ahead of the long holiday weekend. As a reminder, both the\nstock and bond markets will be closed Monday for New Year's Day. Today, though, market participants who stuck around were watching the S&P 500 as it closed in on a new all-time high.\nIn intraday trading, the S&P 500 climbed as high as 4,793.30, a stone's throw away from its all-time closing high of 4,796.56 from January 3, 2022. The broad-market index finished just below here, at 4,783, up 0.04% on the day.\nThe blue chip\nDow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, rose 0.1% to 37,710 – a new record closing high – while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03% to 15,095. The Nasdaq remains about 6% below its all-time closing high of 16,057.44 from November 19, 2021.\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n<a href=\"https://subscribe.kiplinger.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=KPP&cds_page_id=268237&cds_response_key=I3ZPZ001\">\nSave up to 74%\n</a>\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\nToday's gains add to this year's Santa Claus rally, a period encompassing the last five trading days of December and the first two trading days in January when stocks historically do well.\n\"[T]hese 7 days are more likely to be higher than any other 7 days of the year, [with the S&P 500] up 79.5% of the time,\" writes\nRyan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, on X. The data Detrick cites goes back to 1950, and shows the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.3% gain over the seven-day time frame.\nSince its close on Thursday, December 21 – the start of this year's Santa Claus rally – the S&P 500 is up 0.8%.\nJobless claims edge higher\nThursday saw the busiest day for economic data this week. Most notably, a report from the Labor Department showed\ninitial jobless claims rose 2,000 last week to 205,000.\n\"Jobless claims increased during the week ending December 23, but overall, they continue to trend sideways and have yet to show the sustained weakness that the Federal Reserve would like to see,\" says\nEugenio Alemán, chief economist at Raymond James. \"The labor market remains strong and reinforces our view that the Fed is likely to hold rates at current levels until the second half of 2024.\"\nMore\njobs data rolls in next week, including Friday's release of the December nonfarm payrolls report.\nMicrosoft can rally another 20%, analyst says\nIn single-stock news,\nMicrosoft (MSFT, +0.3%) edged higher after Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said it remains a \"best ideas\" pick. Ives also raised his price target on the mega-cap stock to $450 from $425, representing an implied upside of 20% to current levels.\nThe increased price target reflects \"incrementally bullish recent AI [artificial intelligence] customer checks with 'game changing' Co-Pilot monetization now on the doorstep for MSFT into 2024,\" Ives writes in a note to clients. \"We believe the stock still has yet to price in what we view as the next wave of cloud and AI growth coming to the Redmond story with fiscal with a strong competitive cloud edge vs Amazon and Google.\"\nMSFT is set to close out 2023 up 57%, but it's only the third-best\nDow Jones stock on the year. In first place is Salesforce (CRM, -0.4%) with its 101% gain and Intel (INTC, -0.7%) comes in a close second, up 91%.\nRelated content\nWith over a decade of experience writing about the stock market, Karee Venema is an investing editor and options expert at Kiplinger.com.

    "text": "At least five members of a minority Christian community were rescued on Saturday after a Muslim crowd attacked their settlement in eastern Pakistan, police and a community leader said.\\nThe crowd, which accused the Christian group of blasphemy, hurled stones and bricks at the police, said Shariq Kamal, the police chief of Sargodha district.\\nA large contingent of police cordoned off the settlement, he said, adding that the crowd had been pushed back and five injured Christians had been taken to hospital.\\nAt least one house and a small shoe factory were set on fire by protesters who had gathered after neighbours alleged that the Muslim holy book, the Koran, had been desecrated by a minority community member, according to a police spokesman and Akmal Bhatti, a Christian leader.\\n“They burned one house and lynched several Christians,” Bhatti aid.\\nVideos posted on social media showed protesters looting items from burning properties. Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street.\\n\\nBhatti said the videos were images from the scene.\\nThe independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was “at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs”.\\nBlasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching.\\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores.\\nWhile blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\\nA Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.\\n",
