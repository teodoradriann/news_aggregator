    "text": "A report from the National Weather Service was issued on Friday at 5:45 a.m. for strong thunderstorms until 6:15 a.m. for Forest and Clarion counties.\nResidents may experience wind gusts of up to 40 mph.\n\"At 5:45 a.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm over Tionesta, or 13 miles east of Oil City, moving northeast at 35 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Tionesta, Kellettville, West Hickory, Fryburg, East Hickory and Starr.\nThe weather service adds, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nLightning on the horizon: Expert safety measures for thunderstorms Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, which expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\nDriving through downpours: Safety guidelines for wet roads Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nSlow down and stay cautious:\nOn wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\nIf the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "title": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham | Express & Star",
    "text": "The Gunners went down 2-0 at home Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy. The Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium. His West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up. A second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya. Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot. Arsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table. Instead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances. Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular. But at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle. Jarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback. Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola. Paqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller. The hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle. Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after. Mavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour. Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench. Areola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner. Rice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",
