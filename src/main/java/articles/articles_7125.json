    "title": "0.0.0.0 Day: vulnerabilità nei browser da 18 anni",
    "text": "I ricercatori di Oligo hanno scoperto una grave vulnerabilità, denominata 0.0.0.0 Day , presente nei browser da almeno 18 anni. Chrome, Firefox e Safari consentono ai siti web di usare l’indirizzo IP 0.0.0.0 per interagire con i servizi in esecuzione sulla rete locale. Google, Mozilla e Apple sono al lavoro per implementare una soluzione.\nDescrizione della vulnerabilità La RFC 1122 vieta di usare l’ indirizzo IP 0.0.0.0 come destinazione IPv4. Nonostante ciò, tutti i principali browser accettano richieste a questo indirizzo, consentendo ai siti web esterni di comunicare con servizi che vengono eseguiti localmente su macOS e Linux (Windows non è interessato dal problema).\nI siti web potrebbero quindi eseguire codice arbitrario sui dispositivi dei visitatori, usando 0.0.0.0 invece di 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Sfruttando la vulnerabilità 0.0.0.0 Day, un malintenzionato potrebbe accedere alla rete locale, dopo aver convinto la vittima a visitare un sito che invia una richiesta all’indirizzo 0.0.0.0.\nI cybercriminali potrebbero mettere le mani su file, credenziali, messaggi e altri dati, inclusi quelli presenti sui server web. Google ha comunicato che bloccherà l’accesso all’indirizzo 0.0.0.0 a partire da Chrome 128. Apple ha già implementato il blocco nella beta di macOS 15 Sequoia.\nMozilla non ha ancora sviluppato un fix perché il blocco potrebbe avere conseguenze per i server che usano l’indirizzo 0.0.0.0 al posto di localhost (127.0.0.1). Un portavoce ha dichiarato che devono essere valutati eventuali problemi di compatibilità prima di adottare una restrizione. Gli esperti di Oligo hanno fornito alcuni consigli per proteggere le applicazioni locali in attesa dei fix.",

    "text": "Stock Market Today: New Record High Within Reach for S&P 500\nThe main benchmarks notched modest gains in the penultimate trading session of 2023, putting the S&P 500 within striking distance of a new all-time high.\nVolume continues to taper off ahead of the long holiday weekend. As a reminder, both the\nstock and bond markets will be closed Monday for New Year's Day. Today, though, market participants who stuck around were watching the S&P 500 as it closed in on a new all-time high.\nIn intraday trading, the S&P 500 climbed as high as 4,793.30, a stone's throw away from its all-time closing high of 4,796.56 from January 3, 2022. The broad-market index finished just below here, at 4,783, up 0.04% on the day.\nThe blue chip\nDow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, rose 0.1% to 37,710 – a new record closing high – while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03% to 15,095. The Nasdaq remains about 6% below its all-time closing high of 16,057.44 from November 19, 2021.\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n<a href=\"https://subscribe.kiplinger.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=KPP&cds_page_id=268237&cds_response_key=I3ZPZ001\">\nSave up to 74%\n</a>\nSign up for Kiplinger’s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\nToday's gains add to this year's Santa Claus rally, a period encompassing the last five trading days of December and the first two trading days in January when stocks historically do well.\n\"[T]hese 7 days are more likely to be higher than any other 7 days of the year, [with the S&P 500] up 79.5% of the time,\" writes\nRyan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, on X. The data Detrick cites goes back to 1950, and shows the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.3% gain over the seven-day time frame.\nSince its close on Thursday, December 21 – the start of this year's Santa Claus rally – the S&P 500 is up 0.8%.\nJobless claims edge higher\nThursday saw the busiest day for economic data this week. Most notably, a report from the Labor Department showed\ninitial jobless claims rose 2,000 last week to 205,000.\n\"Jobless claims increased during the week ending December 23, but overall, they continue to trend sideways and have yet to show the sustained weakness that the Federal Reserve would like to see,\" says\nEugenio Alemán, chief economist at Raymond James. \"The labor market remains strong and reinforces our view that the Fed is likely to hold rates at current levels until the second half of 2024.\"\nMore\njobs data rolls in next week, including Friday's release of the December nonfarm payrolls report.\nMicrosoft can rally another 20%, analyst says\nIn single-stock news,\nMicrosoft (MSFT, +0.3%) edged higher after Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said it remains a \"best ideas\" pick. Ives also raised his price target on the mega-cap stock to $450 from $425, representing an implied upside of 20% to current levels.\nThe increased price target reflects \"incrementally bullish recent AI [artificial intelligence] customer checks with 'game changing' Co-Pilot monetization now on the doorstep for MSFT into 2024,\" Ives writes in a note to clients. \"We believe the stock still has yet to price in what we view as the next wave of cloud and AI growth coming to the Redmond story with fiscal with a strong competitive cloud edge vs Amazon and Google.\"\nMSFT is set to close out 2023 up 57%, but it's only the third-best\nDow Jones stock on the year. In first place is Salesforce (CRM, -0.4%) with its 101% gain and Intel (INTC, -0.7%) comes in a close second, up 91%.\nRelated content\nWith over a decade of experience writing about the stock market, Karee Venema is an investing editor and options expert at Kiplinger.com.

    "text": "(CNN) – Police in a remote town in Australia removed a problem crocodile from the community on Wednesday.\nAccording to the Northern Territory Police, the crocodile terrorized the town of Bulla recently by lunging out of the water at children and eating multiple dogs.\nAfter shooting the reptile, police said they took it into town where the locals prepared it for a traditional feast.\nPolice said the 3.63 meter-long, or 11.9 foot-long, croc moved into the Baines River near residences after floods from earlier in the year.\nA community in Australia ate the crocodile that had taken several of their pets. (Norther Territory Police) Police said a crocodile safety session was also conducted by Parks and Wildlife with children to give them an up-close look at the dangers within the waterways.\n“Crocodiles can pose a significant risk to community safety,” Commander Kylie Anderson said. “Thanks to the seamless collaboration between Parks and Wildlife, our remote police staff, and local residents we were able to safely remove the large saltie and maintain the safety of the community.”\nSpeaking about the crocodile wrangling, officials added “There’s never a dull moment in remote policing.”\nCopyright 2024 CNN Newsource.

    "title": "Tales From TikTok: Mom Vexed After Man Of 4 Years Slights Her 9-Year-Old Son On Christmas",
    "text": "An emotional Tales From TikTok from one mom has the internet shook with her story about how her boyfriend\nfailed to follow up on their agreement to pass down his older son’s gaming computer to her 9-year-old son for Christmas. Still, she ensured he set up a new one at his older offspring’s house.\nThe TikToker under the username “sincerelybriii” posted the since-deleted video on Christmas morning.\nAccording to Briana’s story, she and her boyfriend agreed to pass his older son’s gaming computer to her child.\n“His older son’s getting a new one, and my son wanted one for Christmas,” Briana said. “I really didn’t want him to have it. I had reservations about him getting a computer. I think he’s a little too young. He’s only nine. But [her boyfriend] convinced me to let him have it. He thought that it would be a good financial decision, also a way for him to have what he wants with us not having to invest too much money.”\nOn Christmas Eve, Briana’s man\narrived at his son’s house, set up his computer nicer than the one he requested, and took the old one.\n“He gets the old computer. He brings it back. We have a dinner to go to, so we go to dinner. At dinner, we’re discussing…I bring up, like, okay, ‘So, what’s the plan?’ We had discussed it prior about a week ago, and the plan was we were going to put it together. Make sure his stuff was ready the night before while he was sleeping so he could wake up and play with his stuff.”\nWhen she mentioned it to her boyfriend, he switched and threw out every excuse he could conjure up.\n“He doesn’t feel like doing it now. His family’s in town. He wants to have some drinks with them, whatever, okay,” she said. “That was just not sitting well with me at all. That was not the plan. This is my son. I wanted him to wake up and enjoy his stuff just like his son gets to wake up [and] enjoy his stuff.”\nSticking up for her son, a rightfully pissed-off Briana questioned why his laziness had to impact her son’s Christmas. And it’s not like he was going to do the setup alone. They agreed to do it together.\nThe lazy comment angered him, and her boyfriend decided to be petty and suggested not giving her son the computer.\n“We are at a girlfriend’s house eating dinner when this happens,” the upset mother clarified. So, I have to pull together and, in my mind, I’m trying to figure out, okay, how am I going to handle this?”\nBriana returned home and finished the job because the computer was her son’s big gift.\n“The other stuff was to supplement the computer,” she said.\nIn an emotional state, Briana began\nassembling the computer desk and chair. When her boyfriend noticed, he had the nerve to say, “I don’t know what you need a computer desk for when you ain’t got no computer.”\nBriana racked her brains for a story to tell her son to avoid ruining his Christmas. She thought about telling him that the computer didn’t come and that they would get it from the electronics store.\n“I was really hoping that I would wake up in the morning and he would still have that computer on that computer desk,” the TikToker expressed. “I wanted more for my son. To not wake up to nothing for Christmas. So, I was up all night. I was tired. I was the last one up.”\nThe boyfriend came to her and asked if she would get out of bed since her son was awake.\n“I go look in the room. There is nothing on the computer stand,” she realized. “I say all of this to say, obviously, this isn’t going to work out. But I just need you to understand, like, do not play with nobody’s kids.”\nBefore deleting the video, her boyfriend took to the comments to affirm things were good.\n“Everything has been made right,” he said. “Plus, I got some today. This is entertainment. I can’t wait for y’all to see part 2.”\nAs for the computer, her boyfriend said he was getting a new one. Briana said she took the post down because of the extensive hate her boyfriend received.\nOnlookers were torn, with some blaming the boyfriend and encouraging the sister to leave. Others claimed she put herself in the position by not getting the computer herself and entrusting her boyfriend with her son’s Christmas present.\n ",
