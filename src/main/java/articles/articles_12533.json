    "title": "Palakkad IIT researchers turn urine into energy and bio-fertilizer, ET EnergyWorld",
    "text": "Palakkad: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Palakkad (IIT-Palakkad) have introduced a pioneering method of generating renewable energy from human urine. In a bid to address the escalating global energy demand and promote sustainable practices, the innovative solution of the IIT team involves a urine-fed, self-driven stacked electrochemical resource recovery reactor, contributing to both electricity generation and biofertilizer production. \\\"The technology utilises the ionic strength of urine and induced electrochemical reactions to produce electricity and facilitates the creation of a biofertilizer rich in Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Magnesium. This breakthrough harnesses the potential of source-separated urine,i.e, urine not mixed with feces presents sustainable solutions in two critical domains - energy and agriculture,\\\" IIT said in a release. It said the integrated technology includes an electrochemical reactor, ammonia adsorption column, decolorisation and chlorination chamber, plumbing, and electrical manifolds. The stacked electrochemical resource recovery reactor (ERRR) employs Magnesium as anode and air carbon as cathode. The anode and cathode are assembled in these acrylic reactor units, which act as cells, it said. \\\"The process begins when the urine is fed into the ERRR through the distribution system, triggering electrochemical reactions that simultaneously produce electricity and biofertilizers. The resulting biofertilizer, rich in essential nutrients, serves as a slow-release fertilizer for plant crops, contributing to sustainable agriculture practices,\\\" IIT said. The release said the system includes continuous data acquisition and monitoring, with 50 cells capable of producing 500 milliwatts (mW) of power and a voltage of 7-12 volts per cycle, resulting in 10 grams of fertilizer every 24-48 hours. IIT said currently at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4, the technology is undergoing laboratory validation, positioning it as a promising candidate for widespread implementation. It also said that the generated electricity is currently used for charging mobile phones and LED lamps, with potential applications in theatres and shopping malls where urine separation at the source is feasible. The team's research, titled \\\"Stale urine catalyzed resource recovery from source-separated urine using magnesium air fuel cell,\\\" has been published in the prestigious journal \\\"Separation and Purification Technology,\\\" garnering significant attention. The team, led by Dr. Praveena Gangadharan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, comprising research scholar Sangeetha V, Sreejith P M, the Project Scientist and Rinu Anna Koshy, the research associate, of the Department, has filed a patent for this technology, marking a significant stride towards sustainable innovation. This project is funded by the Science for Equity Empowerment and Development (SEED) division under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (GOI).",

Mesmo com a ausência de alguns titulares, o poderoso time parisiense não teve dificuldades para conquistar a vitória, com destaque para o astro Kylian Mbappé , que marcou três gols. O técnico Luis Enrique optou por poupar alguns jogadores, principalmente na defesa, visando a sequência da temporada. Com seu hat-trick na partida, Mbappé se tornou o maior artilheiro do clube na Copa da França, com um total de 30 gols. Além disso, o atacante teve a oportunidade de jogar ao lado de seu irmão mais novo, Ethan, que substituiu o brasileiro Lucas Beraldo , recém-contratado pelo clube parisiense – o ex-São Paulo fez sua primeira partida como titular na nova equipe.\nSiga o canal da Jovem Pan Esportes e receba as principais notícias no seu WhatsApp! WhatsApp Outro destaque da partida foi o goleiro titular do PSG, Keylor Navas, que não atuava em um jogo oficial pelo time francês há quase um ano. O costa-riquenho mostrou segurança e contribuiu para a vitória da equipe. Além dos gols de Mbappé, o PSG contou com as contribuições do espanhol Marco Asensio, do português Gonçalo Ramos, de Kolo Muani, que marcou duas vezes, e do italiano Cher Ndour. O zagueiro do Revel, Maxence N’Guessan, também marcou um gol contra. Com essa vitória, o PSG segue firme na busca por mais um título na temporada. A equipe demonstrou sua superioridade diante de um adversário de menor expressão e agora aguarda o sorteio para conhecer seu próximo adversário na Copa da França. A expectativa é que o técnico Luis Enrique possa contar com todos os jogadores para as próximas partidas, visando manter o bom desempenho e conquistar mais troféus.\nLeia também Corpo de Zagallo é sepultado em cemitério no Rio de Janeiro Diretor de comunicações da CBF passa mal durante velório de Zagallo",

    "title": "Website, app launched to digitise Urdu in Nastaleeq font",
    "text": "The development of website www.dastaan.io and its corresponding mobile phone Android app, which can convert images of printed Urdu text in the Nastaleeq script into an editable text for computers and also read them out, was termed on Thursday a landmark event in the digitisation of the Urdu language in the modern era. The website and app have been developed by the Neurocomputation Lab at the NED University of Engineering and Technology in collaboration with the Anjuman Taraqqi-e-Urdu Pakistan. They were launched by NED University Vice Chancellor Dr Sarosh Hashmat Lodi at the varsity’s auditorium on Thursday. Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Aneeq Ahmed, Anjuman President Wajid Jawad and Treasurer Syed Abid Rizvi were also present on the occasion. Explaining how the project was conceived, Jawad said he was once talking to then Jang Group President the late Imran Aslam, who told him that the media group was thinking about publishing the London edition of Daily Jang in the Roman script and had hired a consultant for the job. The Anjuman president said he thought that if Urdu could be converted into the Roman script through digital means, digital means could also be used to convert something into the Nastaleeq script. As he discussed this idea with Aslam, the latter facilitated his correspondence with the consultant, with whose help the Anjuman contacted Lahore University of Management Sciences to provide expertise for the task. Jawad said that when the VC of the NED varsity, which is situated at a stone’s throw from the Anjuman headquarters Urdu Bagh, came to know that the Anjuman was trying to hire LUMS experts to develop some digital platform for Urdu, he complained and said the NED University was a better option for the Anjuman due its close proximity. In this way, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the NED and Anjuman on January 28, 2022. Later, Dr Lodi quipped that neither he nor Jawad had any clear picture of what they were venturing into, but the team of the Neurocomputation Lab under its principal investigator Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi and project head Majida Kazmi actualised their vision. They developed an artificial intelligence-based programme, fed it with a large corpus of Urdu text provided by the Anjuman and enabled it to collect more corpora in Urdu from digital means. The event was told that currently, the website and app could convert any uploaded image of printed Urdu text into editable text form and read it. However, the project was still not finished as they were planning to add more features to it, including converting Urdu text into Braille for people with vision impairment and development of an IOS app. The project head, Dr Majida, said Urdu is one of the most difficult languages to be digitised because of its script in which alphabets keep on changing their form based on their position in the word. She explained that the development of any optical character recognition (OCR) system — an artificial intelligence system that can recognise a written language through its characters — for English or other European languages that are written in the Roman alphabets was way easier because their alphabets were written discretely, and not joined into the following alphabets. She said the Nastaleeq script was also not linear and words came on the line in a diagonal manner. Similarly, she said, some alphabets of Urdu were written above the line while others would go below the line, due to which it is difficult to programme an OCR system for Urdu. The project head said a total of around 300 individuals, including 200 interns, participated in the project and approximately 90,000 man hours were spent on it in around two years. She explained that three master’s thesis and 20 final-year projects were done on the project while a candidate was also pursuing PhD in it. She said any language that was not being digitised was an endangered language in this digital world and therefore the project was very significant for the survival of Urdu. Earlier, the religious affairs minister lamented that although we as a nation often declared our love for Urdu, such professed love did not transform into action. He asked why the examinations for CSS had not been taken into Urdu. He, however, said Urdu was still the national language of Pakistan understood everywhere in the country.

    "text": "Breitbart News economics editor John Carney said Wednesday on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have to resign.\nHost Larry Kudlow said, “This is the Fed bungle, okay? Come on. This is a revolt of the bond vigilantes. The 10 years gone, almost up 75 basis points since the Fed had the jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points. Now bond rates are pulling stocks down. The Fed looks like a damn fool. I’m sorry, but they do.”\nCarney said, “They repealed the Fed’s rate cut, basically. They said Fed independence, bah humbug, the market is saying to the Fed, you did the wrong thing. And this isn’t going to go away, Larry. Right now, they do think they’re going to cut in November, but that December cut is going to come out of the market very soon because people are going to see the numbers still coming in strong.”\nKudlow said, “Trump wins, Jay Powell should resign. That’s my view.”\n12 Days to Go: Panic Sets In for Democrats and Media Elite with John Nolte\nHe added, “The economic estimates by the Fed are completely wrong. There’s a couple of things I want to chew on, but this Fed thing is such a bad story. And it’s starting to hit into the stock market. He was overly exuberantly dovish going all the way back to the Fed Jackson Hole meeting in August. I think that was the first surprise. And then the September jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points. But the rhetoric, even in September, I mean, you kind of smelled a rat way back in August. Whatever, you know, we think the Fed knows more than we do. I don’t think the Fed necessarily knows more than we do and arguably with their poor models they know less.”\nCarney said, “Mary Daly just said to The Wall Street Journal yesterday that she saw no new information that would mean that the Fed should slow down cuts.”\nHe continued., “They’re just blind if that’s the truth. Everybody else in the market sees that obviously this was a mistake, that obviously they need to slow down the cuts at the very least, and the next move could well be up. I agree with you guys, if it’s up, Powell’s got to go.”\nCarney added, “Up and out, is what I say.”\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN\nClips Politics 2024 Presidential Election Carney on Kudlow Donald Trump Jerome Powell John Carney",

That is 2 degrees above the record of 103 degrees and 13 degrees above the normal 90 degrees. The forecast high for Monday is 100, followed by a high of 96 on Tuesday. We have not had high temperatures in the 90s since Sept. 22nd! A disturbance in the jet stream will move in mid to late week and knock temperatures down even further. Highs will likely be in the low 90s on Thursday and maybe the upper 80s by Friday and Saturday. This disturbance will also increase the chance of showers late in the week, although the best chance of showers will be in the higher terrain northeast of Phoenix. In addition to the shower chance for the mountains late in the week, there is a slight possibility that the highest elevations could receive a little snow. Stay tuned!

    "text": "16:25 News Story Colorado ruling that blocks Trump from ballot appealed to U.S. Supreme Court The U.S. Supreme Court, March 25, 2022. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline) The Colorado Republican Party has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that blocks former President Donald Trump from the state’s 2024 presidential ballot. The party, which filed its appeal Wednesday in Anderson v. Griswold, argues that a majority on the Colorado Supreme Court erred in [a historic 4-3 decision](https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/12/19/colorado-supreme-court-trump-2024-ballot-ruling/) it issued Dec. 19. “For the first time in American history, a former President has been disqualified from the ballot, a political party has been denied the opportunity to put forward the presidential candidate of its choice, and the voters have been denied the ability to choose their Chief Executive through the electoral process,” says the party’s writ of certiorari, a petition to the high court asking it to review the case. The U.S. Supreme Court is widely expected to review the case, since the ruling has substantial nationwide implications, but it can decide not to. Six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters, backed by the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, [filed a lawsuit in September](https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/09/06/lawsuit-bar-trump-colorado/) alleging that Trump’s actions around the Jan. 6 insurrection disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Section 3 of the amendment, ratified after the Civil War to deal with former Confederate figures, prohibits a person who “engaged in insurrection” after taking an oath to support the Constitution from holding office again. The plaintiffs announced Thursday that they have filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court to expedite consideration of the GOP’s appeal. “The Colorado Republican Party’s appeal of our clients’ case will address an issue of exceptional national importance — whether, as the Colorado Supreme Court found, a former president, and current candidate for office, who has engaged in insurrection against the Constitution is disqualified from holding office again,” attorney Sean Grimsley said in a statement. A Denver District Court judge [ruled](https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/11/17/colorado-judge-rejects-trump-lawsuit/) that Trump did engage in insurrection, but she said Section 3 does not apply to presidents. She adopted an understanding of Section 3, [discredited by many top constitutional scholars](https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/12/22/why-the-14th-amendment-bars-trump-from-office/), that Trump as president was not an “officer of the United States,” in the language of Section 3. This is the primary argument the Colorado GOP makes in its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Section 3 covers many other offices, but the president is “different in a way that matters,” the appeal says. “Only the President (and Vice-President) face nationwide electoral accountability,” the party said. “And if an electoral majority of the voters determine that they want a certain individual as Chief Executive, regardless of alleged or even actual past transgressions, that is their national choice under the Constitution.” The Colorado plaintiffs named Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold as a defendant, since Griswold had not previously taken a position on whether to disqualify Trump. A Democrat and otherwise outspoken Trump critic, Griswold has since expressed approval of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling. On Thursday she urged the U.S. Supreme Court to “act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.” The deadline for Griswold to certify names for the Colorado presidential primary ballot is Jan. 5. “Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court got it right,” Griswold said in a statement. Griswold said that, with the GOP’s appeal, the primary ballot will include Trump’s name as of Jan. 5 “unless the U.S. Supreme Court declines to take the case or otherwise affirms the Colorado Supreme Court ruling.” Beside claiming that a president is not a Section 3 “officer,” the Colorado Republican Party’s appeal argues that Section 3 is not “self-executing” without enforcement legislation from Congress and that the Colorado ruling violates the state GOP’s First Amendment right of freedom of association.
