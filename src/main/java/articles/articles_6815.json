Le territoire desvrois a une nouvelle fois été victime des éléments. Les pluies abondantes associées à des sols détrempés et saturés n’ont pas manqué d’entraîner des inondations de voiries.\nÀ Crémarest, au niveau de la départementale 254, route de Desvres et de la sortie du Montrocq, mais aussi Bournonville sur le secteur de la Drouille, l’eau a investi la chaussée.

Rebecca Littlejohn. Organizers said nearly 40 clergy and religious leaders from different San Diego faith communities signed and delivered a letter to Senator Padilla. Part of the letter reads, “We are praying in front of your office today, like we pray each day, for you and leaders like you to use the power granted you by your constituents to stop these immoral atrocities.” Organized say anyone interested in participating or learning more about future events can follow their social media . ABC 10News reached out to Senator Padilla's office for comment and had not yet received a response at the time of publication.",

However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the parties' ability to consummate the potential transaction and to meet expectations regarding the timing and completion thereof; and the risk that the parties may be unable to achieve the expected strategic, financial and other benefits of the potential transaction. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q list under the heading \"Risk Factors\" various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.

    "text": "PARIS - French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on June 27 accused his main challenger for the top job, Mr Jordan Bardella, of tolerating racist speech in the ranks of his far-right camp amid a heated last television debate before the start of parliamentary elections.\nThe debate between Mr Attal, National Rally (RN) party chief Bardella and socialist leader Olivier Faure was the last direct confrontation of three radically opposed views on France's future before ballots open for the first voting round on June 30 .\n\"You can't build peace and unity when you present ... more than a hundred candidates who have been accused of making racist remarks\", Mr Attal told Mr Bardella, reading out press reports of the politicians using racial slurs.\n\"Each and every one of us must always be uncompromising with hate speech, because if we are not uncompromising, we end up legitimising it,\" he said.\nMr Bardella, whose party is leading in opinion polls and could emerge the dominant political power in the country for the first time, rebuffed the accusations, shouting \"This is false!\" at his adversary.\n\"I don't like this way of associating a pseudo-climate of hatred with the National Rally electorate\", Mr Bardella said later in the debate.\nReports of assaults motivated by race, homophobia and political allegiance in the run-up to the election has added to France's already tense social climate less then a month before Paris hosts the world for the Olympics.\nIn an unexpected move earlier in June, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved Parliament and called the election after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections. The outcome will be known after a second round of voting on July 7.\nSeeking to present his left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front, as an alternative to those opposing Mr Macron's pro-business agenda without shifting to the right, Mr Faure called for a change of wealth distribution.\nCiting recent protest movements over cost-of-living issues like the \"yellow vests\" and farmers, as well as anger over a recent raise of the retirement age, Mr Faure said: \"It is possible to reject the idea that there are people who through all the crises manage to get richer and richer, while others ... struggle to make ends meet.\" REUTERS\nMore On This Topic French far-right chief Jordan Bardella vows won't let 'Russian imperialism' absorb Ukraine France election 2024: What happens if no one gets an absolute majority?

    "text": "|\n近期，国家市场监督管理总局在全国部署开展老年人药品、保健品虚假宣传专项整治工作。在专项整治过程中，市场监管部门发现有商家为规避监管，通过个人微信、企业微信、微信群等私域渠道将顾客引流至线上，在网站、平台、小程序等开设直播间，假借“养生讲堂”“健康咨询”等名义进行夸大、不实宣传，诱导老年人线上下单或线下消费。 随着我国老龄化程度不断加深，老年人的健康和消费权益愈发受到关注。从“免费听养生课，登记信息送鸡蛋”，到“专家一对一问诊，专治各种慢性病”，再到“点击链接抢购，原价9980现价998”的促销话术……此类推销套路正从菜市场摊位蔓延至微信聊天框，“健康讲座”从社区活动室搬进直播间，老年人遭遇的消费陷阱也随之披上“数字外衣”。市场监管总局近期开展的专项整治行动，剑指假借专家义诊、健康咨询等名义，利用各类论坛、康养旅游、老年大学、养老服务机构等场景和形式实施的“坑老”“骗老”行为，不仅撕开了私域流量时代“坑老”乱象的冰山一角，更敲响了数字时代老龄化治理的警钟。 与传统广告相比，私域流量的虚假宣传就像穿着隐身衣的“毒蛇”，其套路之隐蔽、手段之刁钻令人防不胜防。如：以“免费送鸡蛋”“社区义诊”“老年福利会”等线下活动为诱饵，吸引老年人添加微信、加入微信群，随后在直播间通过“伪科学养生课”“专家一对一咨询”等形式，夸大产品“治疗高血压”“抗癌防癌”等功效，诱导购买价格虚高的“神药”“神品”，让数以万计的老年人陷入精心编织的“养生幻梦”。这类新型骗局之所以屡禁难绝，根源在于精准击中了老年群体的情感软肋（孤独感、被关怀的需求）与认知盲区（对新技术、医学常识的陌生），不仅掏空养老钱，甚至严重损害身体，延误病情治疗。 私域流量不是“法外之地”。整治私域“坑老”乱象，守护老年人的消费权益，刻不容缓。从要求电商平台下架违规产品，到严查“会销”场所的虚假宣传；从畅通12315投诉渠道，到联合社区开展防诈讲座，监管部门已打出了一系列的“组合拳”。更为关键的是，整治并非“一阵风”，而是直击问题根源。比如：建立保健品广告“负面清单”，让企业不敢乱打“疗效牌”；推动社区建立“银龄守护站”，用正规健康服务挤压虚假宣传生存空间；引导子女多回家陪伴父母，用亲情填补孤独留下的“心理缺口”。这些举措既治标又治本，让老年人在数字时代安享有尊严有温度的晚年。这既是法治社会的必然要求，更是文明社会应有的温情注脚。 整治“坑老”乱象，守护夕阳红里的消费尊严，考验着社会治理的智慧与温度。从线上到线下，从平台到家庭，监管利剑高悬、子女亲情护航、社会共治聚力，拆穿“养生讲堂”的虚假话术，封禁虚假宣传的直播间，斩断“坑老”“骗老”的黑手，构建起“不敢骗、不能骗、骗不了”的立体防线。这不仅是守护老年人的钱袋子，更是捍卫社会公平正义的底线。唯有让违法者付出难以承受的代价，让监管利剑始终高悬，才能让“养生”回归滋养生命的本真，让老年人远离消费陷阱、安享健康的晚年生活。（林伟） |\n|\n扫一扫在手机打开当前页\n|\n|",

    "text": "Italian G7 Presidency and UNDP Announce AI Hub for Sustainable Development in Africa Africa stands on the brink of a significant Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by a youthful population, dynamic tech ecosystems, and increasing connectivity. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/news-source/Devdiscourse News Desk)| Rome | Updated: 19-07-2024 11:26 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 11:26 IST During last month’s G7 Leaders Summit, the Italian G7 Presidency reaffirmed its commitment to establishing an ‘AI Hub for Sustainable Development’ in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The release of the first public report on the co-design of the hub today provides initial suggestions and consolidated feedback from local AI ecosystems in Africa. Africa stands on the brink of a significant Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, driven by a youthful population, dynamic tech ecosystems, and increasing connectivity. This presents a tremendous opportunity to develop and scale local solutions tailored to African contexts. Realizing this potential for inclusive economic growth requires collaborative efforts to propel responsible AI development across the continent. The G7 Leaders’ Declaration affirms that the hub will foster multi-stakeholder partnerships to support local AI digital ecosystems, strengthen capacities to advance AI for sustainable development, and complement existing initiatives, including the AI for Development Donors Partnership. The report emphasizes that the core foundations underpinning AI’s potential for sustainable development include data pipelines, green computational power, and talent. Accelerating responsible private sector innovation and partnerships in these areas is a primary goal of the hub. The hub will work in tandem with governments and local ecosystems to ensure close collaboration with partners focused on AI governance and its local applications. As the Italian G7 Presidency prepares to strengthen the ‘Digital Development: Growing Together’ agenda—a core priority of the G7 in 2024 with a focus on Africa—a new era of collective action is becoming possible. The hub underscores Italy's commitment to a partnership-based approach with African nations, aiming to foster equal cooperation and mutual benefits. In partnership with the G7, the UNDP will continue to serve as a platform to foster new partnerships and investments from both the public and private sectors, ensuring that AI becomes a catalyst for positive change across countries.
