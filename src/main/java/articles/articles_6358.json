    "title": "‘Twisters’ review: Sequel delivers big thrills and nice character moments",
    "text": "“Twisters” director Lee Isaac Chung made headlines recently in defending the decision to keep the topic of climate change out of the sequel to the 1996 natural disaster-fueled blockbuster “Twister.”\n“I just wanted to make sure that with the movie, we don’t ever feel like (it) is putting forward any message,” he said in an interview with CNN . “I just don’t feel like films are meant to be message-oriented.”\nAt first, this feels like a missed opportunity — and, arguably, cowardice on the part of Chung and the production — given climate change’s well-documented link to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events . (To be fair, though, the link between climate change and tornadoes isn’t so clear .)\nHowever, having seen “Twisters” — which is blowing into theaters this week with incredible force — we like it just the way it is. Chung has made a well-crafted, consistently entertaining sequel that benefits both from stars Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell and nearly 30 years of impactful special-effects development that help make the original feel, well, nearly three decades old.\nChung rose to prominence as the writer-director of 2020’s acclaimed “Minari,” a semi-autobiographical film. And while he subsequently directed an episode of the “Star Wars” series “The Mandalorian,” he’s never helmed anything with the scale of “Twisters” and action-heavy nature of “Twisters.” Working from a screenplay by Mark L. Smith (“The Revenant”) — with the story credited to “Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski — Chung doesn’t let the occasional silly plot development or the fact the movie has too many characters get in his way. He balances all the hurricane-force thrills the movie requires with myriad satisfying character moments.\nMany of those circle around Edgar-Jones’ Kate Carter. We meet her in the movie’s prologue, during which she is getting help with friends — including boyfriend Javi — chasing storms in Oklahoma for a college project. (In one of only a couple of noticeable nods to “Twister,” they are using a version of the “Dorothy” machine featured heavily in that movie.)\nThey are out to collapse — or, as they like to say, “tame” a tornado. However, let’s just say they meet a cyclone that gets the best of them.\nFive years later, Kate, having given up chasing, is working as a storm tracker for the United States Weather in New York City when Javi shows up out of the blue. Now working for a private company using a portable version of a weather-tracking radar system he used in the military since their time together, he says he needs to spend one week in Oklahoma to help him test the tech in what’s expected to be a once-in-a-generation tornadoes-filled event.\n“You have a gift,” he says. “I can’t do this without you.”\nIn Oklahoma, she meets his crew of uniformed “Ph.Ds,” including right-hand company man (future Superman David Corenswet), as well as a group of rough-around-the-edges storm chasers from Arkansas — “hillbillies with a YouTube channel,” as someone puts it.\nLeading them is cool and cocky “tornado wrangler” Tyler Owens (Powell), who takes an immediate interest in Kate, calling her “city girl.” Initially, she gives him the cold shoulder — and some misleading information regarding where to find their next twister — but, of course, the pair will grow closer as “Twisters” proceeds.\nKate, portrayed by Daisy Edgar-Jones, is unimpressed by cocky storm chaser Tyler, right, even as he’s being followed for a story by journalist Ben, portrayed by Harry Hadden-Paton, early on in “Twisters.” (Courtesy of Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment) In Kate and Tyler, we have two sides of the same coin, storm trackers who rely on both carefully gathered data and gut instinct. But while she is most interested in giving people more of a warning a tornado may be coming their way, he and his lot concern themselves primarily with shooting fireworks up through a cyclone and, importantly, getting potentially viral footage of it.\nOr so she thinks.\nThanks both to Smith’s script and the performances of Edgar-Jones and Powell, Kate and Tyler form an appealing tandem; if not the soul of the story, she’s its conscience, while he provides its requisite bravado and adventurous spirit.\nPowell, a fellow “Top Gun: Maverick” alum, continues to display the movie-star charisma he exhibited in last year’s “Anyone But You,” while “Normal People” and “Where the Crawdads Sing” star Edgar-Jones is compelling via subtle acting choices instead of big moments.\nUnderstandably, some may be disappointed “Twisters” doesn’t connect more to the original — “Twister” star Helen Hunt has said a pitch she made in 2020 to helm a sequel was rejected — but this follow-up more than lives up to its predecessor.\nTyler (Glen Powell) tries to save pal Lily (Sasha Lane) in a scene from “Twisters.” (Courtesy of Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment) And, OK, so “An Inconvenient Truth” “Twisters” is not. It’s a popcorn movie chock-full of barns being torn apart, cars being hurled through the air and a few innocent people meeting highly inconvenient ends.\nAnd, even with a soundtrack packed with country jams, it really rocks.\n‘Twisters’ Where: Theaters.\nWhen: July 19.\nRated: PG-13 for intense action and peril, some language and injury images.\nRuntime: 2 hours, 2 minutes.\nStars (of four): 3.5.",

    "title": "Why America’s Enemies Still Fear the B-1 Bomber",
    "text": "The B-1 Bomber: A Force to Be Reckoned With\nThe United States Air Force’s B-1 Bomber, affectionately known as “Bones,” is a formidable aircraft that continues to strike fear into the hearts of America’s enemies. With its sleek design, impressive agility, and devastating firepower, the B-1 Bomber is a true marvel of engineering and a testament to American military prowess.\nA Brief History of the B-1 Bomber The B-1 Bomber was first introduced in the 1970s as a replacement for the aging B-52 Stratofortress. Designed to carry a heavy payload of conventional or nuclear weapons, the B-1 was intended to be a long-range, high-speed bomber capable of penetrating enemy airspace and delivering its deadly cargo with precision.\nHowever, due to various factors, including budget cuts and changing military priorities, the B-1 program faced numerous setbacks and delays. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the B-1B Lancer, an updated version of the original B-1, finally entered service. Despite its troubled development, the B-1B proved to be a highly capable aircraft, playing a crucial role in several conflicts, including the Gulf War and the Kosovo War.\nThe B-1 Bomber’s Design and Capabilities The B-1 Bomber is a truly remarkable aircraft, boasting a unique design that sets it apart from other bombers. Its distinctive shape, characterized by its swept wings and variable-geometry inlets, allows for exceptional speed and maneuverability. Powered by four powerful turbofan engines, the B-1 can reach supersonic speeds, enabling it to evade enemy defenses and deliver its payload with precision.\nIn addition to its impressive speed, the B-1 Bomber also boasts an extensive range, allowing it to carry out long-range missions without the need for refueling. This extended range makes the B-1 ideal for global operations, providing the United States with a strategic advantage in any potential conflict.\nThe B-1 Bomber’s Armament The B-1 Bomber is equipped with a wide array of weaponry, making it a versatile and deadly platform. Its primary armament consists of guided bombs, including the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and the Guided Bomb Unit (GBU), which can be precisely guided to their targets using GPS technology.\nIn addition to bombs, the B-1 Bomber can also carry air-to-surface missiles, such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), which can strike targets from a safe distance. Furthermore, the B-1 is equipped with a defensive system that includes chaff and flare dispensers, as well as an electronic countermeasures suite, to protect itself from enemy radar and missiles.\nThe B-1 Bomber’s Role in Modern Warfare The B-1 Bomber continues to play a vital role in modern warfare, providing the United States with a strategic asset that can be deployed anywhere in the world. Its ability to carry a heavy payload, fly at supersonic speeds, and strike targets with precision makes it an indispensable tool in the U.S. military’s arsenal.\nIn recent years, the B-1 Bomber has been involved in various operations, including airstrikes against terrorist targets in the Middle East and support for NATO operations in Europe. Its versatility and effectiveness have made it a key component of the U.S. military’s strategy for deterring and defeating its adversaries.\nConclusion The B-1 Bomber is a testament to American engineering ingenuity and military might. Its combination of speed, range, and firepower makes it a formidable force that continues to strike fear into the hearts of America’s enemies. As the United States faces new challenges and threats in the ever-changing landscape of global security, the B-1 Bomber stands ready to defend the nation and its allies, ensuring peace and stability in a turbulent world.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Elevating the Veer Bal Diwas - the martyrdom day of Guru Gobind Singh's sons known as Sahibzadas - to a pan-India event, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the 'Suposhit Gram Panchayat Abhiyan' to encourage healthy living and combat malnutrition while drawing a parallel between the Sahibzadas' valour and the ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The day, which celebrates the bravery of Sahibzadas Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, who, at a tender age, faced the tyranny of the Mughal empire with unwavering faith and courage, saw 17 young achievers being honoured for their bravery, innovation, and contributions to science and technology, arts and sports. On the occasion of the third Veer Bal Diwas, Modi paid homage to the sacrifice of the Sahibzadas and underscored their enduring legacy as an inspiration for national unity and youth empowerment. \\\"The robust democracy that India takes pride in today is built on the foundation of the courage and sacrifices of the Sahibzadas,\\\" Modi said. Highlighting the Constitution's commitment to equality and welfare, he noted its resonance with the teachings of the Gurus. He stressed the transformative potential of the youth in shaping a developed India. Initiatives like the National Education Policy, Atal Tinkering Labs, and campaigns like Fit India and Khelo India were highlighted as steps to modernise education, foster innovation, and ensure a healthy, future-ready generation.The Suposhit Gram Panchayat campaign was launched to encourage healthy competition among villages, aiming for a nourished and prosperous India.",

    "text": "El papa Francisco afirmó en una entrevista que Ucrania debería tener lo que él llama el coraje de \"izar la bandera blanca\" y negociar el fin de la guerra con Rusia que siguió a la invasión a gran escala de Moscú hace dos años y que ha matado a decenas de miles de personas.\nPublicidad Francisco hizo estos comentarios en una entrevista grabada el mes pasado con la emisora suiza RSI, mucho antes de la última oferta del viernes del presidente turco, Tayyip Erdogan, de acoger una cumbre entre Ucrania y Rusia para poner fin a la guerra.\nErdogan hizo esta nueva oferta tras reunirse en Estambul con su homólogo ucraniano, Volodímir Zelenski. Zelenski ha declarado que, aunque desea la paz, no cederá ningún territorio.\nEl propio plan de paz del líder ucraniano exige la retirada de las tropas rusas de toda Ucrania y el restablecimiento de sus fronteras estatales. El Kremlin ha descartado entablar conversaciones de paz en los términos fijados por Kiev.\nUn portavoz de Zelenski no respondió inmediatamente a una petición de comentarios sobre las declaraciones del Sumo Pontífice.\nEn la entrevista, el Santo Padre fue preguntado por su postura en un debate entre los que dicen que Ucrania debería rendirse al no haber sido capaz de repeler a las fuerzas rusas, y los que dicen que hacerlo legitimaría las acciones de la parte más fuerte. El entrevistador utilizó el término \"bandera blanca\" en la pregunta.\n\"Es una interpretación\", dijo Francisco, según una transcripción anticipada de la entrevista y un video parcial a los que Reuters tuvo acceso el sábado. Está previsto que se emita el 20 de marzo como parte de un nuevo programa cultural.\nLee: Internacional Zelenski dice que han muerto 31,000 soldados ucranianos desde la invasión rusa \"Pero creo que son más fuertes quienes ven la situación, quienes piensan en el pueblo, quienes tienen el coraje de izar la bandera blanca y negociar\", dijo Francisco, añadiendo que las conversaciones deberían tener lugar con la ayuda de las potencias internacionales.\n\"La palabra negociar es una palabra valiente. Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van bien, necesitas tener el coraje de negociar\", dijo Francisco.\nPublicidad podcast Escucha nuestros podcast aquí Elecciones 2024 Evento de Clara Brugada en Centro de CDMX cambia de sede tras irrupción Liga del Cambio: exmorenistas y excalderonistas \"firman\" en el equipo de Taboada Máynez y el reto de ganar el voto joven en las universidades y redes sociales ver más Publicidad Se cree que es la primera vez que el Papa utiliza términos como \"bandera blanca\" o \"derrotado\" al hablar de la guerra de Ucrania, aunque ya ha hablado en el pasado de la necesidad de negociar.\nEn un comunicado, el portavoz del Vaticano, Matteo Bruni, dijo que el Papa había recogido el término \"bandera blanca\" usado por el entrevistador y lo había utilizado \"para indicar el cese de las hostilidades (y) una tregua lograda con el valor de las negociaciones\".\nEl año pasado, el Papa de 87 años destinó a un enviado de paz, el cardenal italiano Matteo Zuppi, a Kiev, Moscú y Washington para sondear a los líderes de esos países.\n\"Te da vergüenza\", dijo Francisco sobre negociar, \"pero ¿con cuántas muertes terminará (la guerra)? (Uno debería) negociar a tiempo, buscar algún país que actúe como mediador\", agregó, mencionando a Turquía entre los países que se habían ofrecido.\n\"No tengan vergüenza de negociar antes de que las cosas empeoren\", dijo Francisco, que ha hecho cientos de llamamientos por lo que él llama la \"Ucrania mártir\". A la pregunta de si estaba dispuesto a mediar, el Santo Padre respondió: \"Estoy aquí\".\nEn otra parte de la entrevista, hablando de la guerra entre Israel y Hamás, Francisco dijo: \"La negociación nunca es una rendición\".\nEl mes pasado, Zelenski afirmó que 31,000 soldados ucranianos habían muerto desde la invasión rusa de febrero de 2022 y que decenas de miles de civiles habían sido asesinados en las zonas ocupadas del país.\nLo Último La Normal de Ayotzinapa, levantada por estudiantes, lleva décadas bajo ataques Se mantiene la mala calidad del aire en gran parte del Valle de México Una mujer muere tras sufrir infarto durante la marcha del 8M en CDMX Ebrard y Xóchitl Gálvez chocan por sus opiniones añejas sobre Sheinbaum Publicidad Publicidad Tags Papa Francisco Conflicto Ucrania y Rusia Recomendaciones Empresas Zara volverá a Ucrania tras dos años de cierre por la guerra 1 Min Read Internacional Gobiernos europeos descartan enviar tropas a Ucrania como sugiere Francia 2 Min Read Internacional El presidente de Ucrania promete derrotar a Rusia 4 Min Read Más acerca del autor: Reuters @ExpansionMx Newsletter",
