    "title": "An expert guide to ski holidays in Whistler, Canada | Telegraph Travel",
    "text": "Boasting dramatic mountain scenery and a lively après scene, Whistler, on the west coast of Canada in British Columbia, is much more European in flavour than most North American resorts. Twenty years ago, it was more of a locals’ mountain than the top international resort it is now.\nThese days, even though it has grown, it still has many of the things that made it so special at the beginning – sniffle stations, Belgian waffles on the mountain, pitchers of margaritas in resort and the sort of snow that inspires powderhounds to sing with joy.\nThe Peak 2 Peak gondola links the two mountains of Whistler and Blackcomb, and the resort's 8,171-acre ski area is one of the largest in the world. It also has long top-to-bottom slopes, with 1,610m of vertical on Blackcomb and 1,530m on Whistler. Running from mid-November until May, the season here is long and snow-sure, with an average snowfall of around 11m.\nStay on track with the essential facts from the resort below, and scroll down for our insider guide to a day on the pistes, expert ratings and advice. For further Whistler inspiration, see our guides to the resort's best accommodation , restaurants and après ski .\nIn this guide: Inside the resort On the slopes Who should go Essential information Ski fast facts |Whistler, Canada Inside the resort\nAt the base, Whistler is a big place, divided into several sectors. The main hub is Whistler Village, which is car free so it’s pleasant to stroll through, break for a cappuccino, or window-shop around the ever-increasing number of boutiques and shops, offering everything from home furnishings to designer art. There is also accommodation and facilities outside this main area in the Marketplace and North Village sectors.\nUpper Village is at the base of Blackcomb mountain, a pleasant 10-minute walk or a free bus ride from the car-free Village. Creekside, outside the main village to the southwest, makes a quieter base and also has direct access to the slopes of Whistler mountain.\nAs well as global recognition, the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games brought millions of dollars’ worth of expansion and improvements to both the town and the slopes. However, the resort can suffer from lift queues, especially at weekends and peak times. It’s especially busy around Christmas, New Year, public holidays and sunny weekends as it’s only a couple of hours’ drive from Vancouver and a five-hour drive from Seattle.\nWhistler village is where most of the action happens at night Credit : MIKE CRANE Vail Resorts, Whistler’s owner, has continued the investment to speed up travel around the area and reduce queues. A 10-passenger gondola on Blackcomb mountain makes travel from the base to the top much faster for people staying in the Upper Village area. It arrives adjacent to the Peak 2 Peak Gondola.\nNew for 2023/24 is the replacement of the four-person Fitzsimmons chairlift from Whistler Village base, by an eight-person high speed chair, increasing capacity by 73 per cent.\nWinter 2022/23 saw the replacement of the existing four-person Big Red Express lift with a new high-speed, six-person chair and the replacement of the existing six-person Creekside gondola with a high-speed 10-person gondola. Both will help cut waiting times out of the Creekside area.\nThere is a strong selection of spas, restaurants and family activities on offer, making Whistler a good all-round destination with appeal even for non-skiers. There are scenic helicopter rides around the area, and live music and concerts throughout the season. The Scandinave Spa is a luxurious retreat set in stunning wilderness and boasting hot tubs at different temperatures, massages and other treatment options.\nThere’s a range of activities to try at the Olympic Park just south of Whistler, including snowshoeing, tobogganing and tours of the Olympic ski jump and biathlon rifle range. The Whistler Sliding Centre on Blackcomb mountain offers a chance to try a four-man bobsleigh or skeleton.\nFor UK visitors, the exchange rate, fuel surcharges, lift passes and added taxes make Whistler an expensive destination. But with world-class terrain, lively nightlife and a packed programme of extra-curricular activities off the slopes, there is a lot on offer for the investment.\nWhistler Our ratings | Out of five On the slopes\nWhistler’s two linked mountains, Whistler and Blackcomb, share a huge 8,171 acre ski area with a lift-served vertical drop of 1,610m, served by 32 lifts. There are over 200 runs that include interest for all levels – pistes are classed as 18 per cent beginner (greens), 55 per cent intermediate (blues) and 27 per cent expert (blacks).\nSteeper pitches are marked as black diamonds or even gnarlier double black diamonds, and there’s extensive off-piste terrain too. The resort boasts 16 alpine bowls and three glaciers, and a large number of backcountry itineraries outside the ski area.\nThere are also good facilities for novices. Whistler mountain is very beginner-friendly, with a learning area with covered magic carpet lifts, and plenty of snowmaking and confidence-building green runs. After first turns, there are top-to-bottom of the mountain green runs to progress to.\nWhistler has plenty of terrain for skiers of all levels to explore Credit : Guy Fattal/Tourism Whistler The Peak 2 Peak gondola links Whistler and Blackcomb’s high alpine terrain, meaning that access to both hills is equally convenient from Whistler’s three resort bases – Whistler Village, Upper Village and Creekside.\nWhistler Mountain is a good place to start the day, as it’s generally sunnier in the morning, before riding the Peak 2 Peak to Blackcomb for the afternoon. A queue-avoiding tip for busy days at the Whistler Village gondola is to take the Fitzsimmons chair up Whistler Mountain – or to start from the Blackcomb base.\nNew for 2023/24 is the replacement of this four-person Fitzsimmons chairlift, by an eight-person high speed chair, increasing uphill capacity by 73 per cent.\nRegular updates mean the resort’s fast lifts make reasonably quick work of queues. A two-stage 10-passenger gondola from the Upper Village to the top of Blackcomb, arriving adjacent to the Peak 2 Peak gondola, is another of the most recent additions, as well as high-speed chairlifts installed on both Blackcomb and Whistler.\n2022/23 saw the replacement of the existing four-person Big Red Express lift with a new high-speed, six-person chair and the replacement of the existing six-person Creekside gondola with a high-speed eight-person gondola. Both help cut waiting times out of the Creekside area.\nTo help get to know the ski area, the resort runs free orientation tours for intermediates and experts every morning, with sessions for both Whistler and Blackcomb mountains. For those who prefer to go it alone, there are six Wonder Routes, marked colour-coded routes of discovery for various levels around the ski area, taking in different pistes and points of interest. One highlight of the ski area is the Dave Murray downhill run to Creekside, used for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nWhistler also offers a ticketed Fresh Tracks service, giving early birds the chance to be first on the freshly groomed or powder slopes. It starts with an early gondola up Whistler mountain, and the price includes a food voucher for refreshments. Backcountry opportunities include cat skiing, heliskiing and ski touring.\nWhistler and Blackcomb mountains have eight terrain parks between them, covering 99 acres and rated S, M, L and XL according to difficulty. They include a super-pipe (Olympic standard halfpipe with 7m high walls), a skicross course, and more than 150 features and 40 jumps. Smaller rails and rollers can be found in the Big Easy Terrain Garden on Blackcomb.",

    "text": "Inondations en Allemagne : deux jours de précipitations intenses attendus, la situation pourrait s’aggraver\nCertaines régions allemandes touchées par les inondations doivent se préparer vendredi à de nouvelles précipitations intenses, selon les prévisions de l’institut météorologique allemand DWD.\nPlusieurs endroits dans le Land de Rhénanie du Nord-Westphalie, situé dans l’ouest de l’Allemagne, et dans les massifs montagneux du Harz, au centre du pays, seront touchés par des pluies continues vendredi et samedi. Jusqu’à 40 mm de pluie devraient tomber en 24 heures.\nDans le Land de Basse-Saxe, dans le nord-ouest, la situation est tendue. Les régions le long des rivières Aller, Leine et Weser sont déjà inondées.\nLe ministre-président du Land, Stephan Weil, a indiqué jeudi qu’il n’y avait jamais eu d’inondations de cette ampleur dans la région. « Les experts avertissent depuis longtemps que les conditions météorologiques extrêmes, de plus en plus fréquentes, sont liées au dérèglement climatique », a-t-il expliqué.\nLe niveau de l’eau du fleuve Elbe dans la ville de Dresde devrait encore monter. Jeudi après-midi, l’eau se situait à 5,92 mètres de hauteur. Si le niveau grimpe à six mètres, le deuxième niveau d’alerte le plus élevé est alors déclaré. Le centre d’inondation des autorités s’attend à ce que cela se produise vendredi matin. Le niveau habituel du fleuve est à deux mètres.",
