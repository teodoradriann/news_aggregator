    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Saline County, Kansas from 1901-2000 was 31.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Saline County, Kansas experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Saline County, Kansas history.",

    "title": "SA opens Africa’s first military-focused AI hub",
    "text": "By Simnikiwe Mzekandaba, IT in government editorJohannesburg, 06 May 2024 AI, with its vast applications, is set to bring about a structural transformation in national security. South Africa now has an artificial intelligence (AI) institute dedicated to the defence and military sector, as part of the hubs of the AI Institute of South Africa (AIISA). ITWeb first reported on the imminent launch of the AI hub at the South African Military Academy last month. On Friday, communications minister Mondli Gungubele officially launched the Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Unit (DAIRU) at the academy in Saldanha Bay, Western Cape. DAIRU is the fourth hub to be added, after the launch of others at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) in 2022, Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) in 2023 and the Central University of Technology in February. The DAIRU hub, according to the minister, is the first of its kind on the African continent. The new hub is a collaborative effort between Gungubele’s Department of Communications and Digital Technologies (DCDT) and Department of Defence and Military Veterans. See also Andile Ngcaba lobbies for minister of AI Tshwane university opens doors to AI hub According to the DCDT, DAIRU aims to harness the “transformative” power of AI to elevate South Africa’s defence sector, ensuring the country keeps up with the pace of utilising cutting-edge technology to maintain strategic advantage and national security. The two departments, having realised the importance of technological-led AI development and application, devised a process to launch the defence AI hub to focus on military uses of AI, automation and robotics, said Gungubele. “As a democratic state, we wholly support the belief that AI is key to groundbreaking socio-economic development for the country. “The launch of this Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Unit is not simply a bureaucratic ritual with little to no significance or practical impact. We have held numerous public events around 4IR [the fourth industrial revolution], all of them setting the tone in educating and promoting this new technology among South Africans. “As we meet today, we take an important step towards a future that benefits our country through AI, positioning ourselves strategically as a country to be reckoned with and as a viable trading partner in a globally connected future.” Inside the South African Military Academy in Saldanha Bay, Western Cape. Artificial intelligence continues to grow in importance worldwide, with the United Arab Emirates appointing an AI-dedicated minister to lead that nation’s AI strategy. This prompted SA businessman Andile Ngcaba to call for a similar post locally. Last year saw unprecedented AI advancements, with a wide range of tools, solutions and industries adopting the technology. The launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 brought to public attention the power of generative AI. Since then, Google’s Gemini Pro, Microsoft’s Bing AI and Elon Musk’s xAI have been introduced, showcasing generative AI’s evolution. Most recently, Facebook owner Meta kicked off its AI push through its chatbot embedded across its social media platforms – Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Threads. In South Africa, the launch of the AIISA institutes signals the realisation of one of the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, to catapult the country’s digital future. The hubs are expected to serve as a common base for knowledge generation, research and development, as well as implementing the capabilities of AI applications for health, agriculture, finance, mining, manufacturing and government. Each hub is linked with an economic sector that can be enhanced through AI and a series of catalytical projects. For example, the UJ hub focuses on the value chain of manufacturing, retail, fintech, digital mining, the energy sector, digital banking and identity, as well as the criminal justice system. The TUT hub is linked to automotive, farming and food production, 4IR manufacturing, tourism, health, transportation and telecommunications. Gungubele revealed the purpose is to ensure sectors such as water and waste management, the just energy transition, built environment, health, telecoms, media and languages also have AI hubs. AI in defence targets The minister said emerging technologies, including AI, are now the focal points of geopolitical competition, with nations like China, Russia and the US aggressively exploring the military applications of AI. The rapid pace of technological innovation, coupled with the rise of Asia as a global trade hub, necessitates a re-evaluation of national security strategies, he noted. AI, akin to electricity or fossil fuels, has the potential to redefine modern militaries and reshape the global balance of power, he added. “The convergence of physical, digital and biological technologies heralds the onset of a significant technological revolution. Governing these emerging technologies at a global level is imperative to mitigate the risks of future conflicts. “As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into the world’s militaries, establishing clear guidelines and risk-reduction measures will be crucial to ensure global peace and security. “The national defence policy review underscores government’s focus on technology, with a significant budget allocation for defence technologies aligned to AI development and research. “AI, with its vast applications, is set to bring about a structural transformation in national security. The defence review envisions this transformation and emphasises the need for a proactive approach to harness the potential of AI in defence and security.” The Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Unit is located at the SA Military Academy in Saldanha Bay, Western Cape. The minister noted it’s expected there will be an exponential rise of AI in military applications over the next decade. The military is seeking to integrate AI into weapon systems development to enhance precision, as well as augment human operators with AI-driven robotic manoeuvres on the battlefield. AI already has deep impacts on nuclear armament, cyber and information warfare, biotechnologies and aerospace, he commented. “The AI systems and applications combined with software are also expected to bring about an adversarial AI arms-race. “AI supports long-term defence capability planning processes in the military through the development of analytical solutions, including supporting complex decision-making by assessing complex factors.” Share Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

    "text": "The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly five months amid gathering hopes that the UK will avoid a recession. Sterling climbed to $1.2827, its strongest since August 1, before giving up the gains later in the session. It comes as analysts see further gains for sterling against the dollar next year, with experts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicting it could hit $1.35. That would be a far cry from the aftermath of last year’s mini-Budget when sterling hit a record low of less than $1.04. The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve looks closer to pulling the trigger on interest rate cuts next year. On the charge: The pound is being buoyed versus the greenback on bets that the US Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on interest rate cuts next year Markets are also looking ahead to next year’s Budget after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would take place on March 6. And a survey of 52 economists by Bloomberg suggested that the UK was heading for a so-called ‘soft landing’ in which inflation is brought down without causing a downturn. They predicted that after a bumpy start to next year, GDP would grow by 0.3 per cent as consumers enjoy lower inflation, bringing an end to the cost of living crisis. But the Bank of England predicts that growth will flatline in 2024. The report was not entirely positive, with a third forecasting that the economy will have shrunk in the fourth quarter of this year. That would imply a recession – defined as two quarters in a row of contraction – as GDP has already shrunk by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. Dan Hanson, at Bloomberg Economics, said the economy will ‘tread a fine line between stagnation and contraction in the first half’ of 2024.",

Xiaomi autos caught in a storm of automatic parking failures, the second model may be launched in the first quarter of next year. Securities Times · 20 mins ago XIAOMI-W +1.24% 来源：证券时报\n作者：王小伟\n就在小米SU7交付量目标不断抬升的同时，某些功能故障也在出现。\n小米SU7陷自动泊车功能故障风波 近日，有媒体统计到70多位小米SU7标准版车主在特定时间因自动泊车功能故障， 导致车辆泊车过程中发生剐蹭和碰撞。被统计的车主来自北京、天津等多地，有些车主是在社交平台自曝的故障，为此还专门成立了“小米SU7标准版事故车主群”。有些车主在短视频平台提醒“别用自动泊车了”。\n目前已经有故障车主多次联系小米客服，并将车送到了小米4S店进行数据检测和分析。小米官方对车主表示，愿意承担全部维修费用，并提供积分补偿。\n自动泊车又称智能泊车，驾驶员行驶车辆至车位附近后，开启自动泊车功能，车辆将识别目标车位并自动泊入。\n按照AI给出的判断，自动泊车功能故障的可能原因包括传感器故障、软件错误、电气问题等，解决方法包括检查和清洁传感器、更新软件、检查线路连接等。\n日前，在“小米汽车答网友问”中曾对“小米 SU7 的智驾功能在没有信号的地库还能使用么？还能自动泊车吗？”进行过回答。\n其中表示，小米智能泊车功能跟网络信号无关，即便没有网络信号，小米智能泊车功能依旧可正常使用。小米全系车型均搭载了基于端到端模型的代客泊车辅助功能，可以实现最高23km/h的地下车库巡航。对停车场内车道、障碍物进行精确感知，并实现障碍物绕行、甚至倒车避让。车上搭载的智驾芯片完成全部运算，因此功能的实现并不需要网络信号。\n第二款车型或明年2、3月上市 今年11月13日，雷军在个人微博宣布，第十万台小米SU7正式下线。“一家新车企，第一台车，发布后仅仅230天就下线10万台，这是前所未有的奇迹。”雷军说。\n当天，雷军在个人社交账号发了一张自己躺在车间地板上睡觉的照片并写道：“网友们催我到工厂拧螺丝。其实，我经常去，今天一大早就到了。来得太早，在车间又眯了一会。没想到，一觉醒来，10万台已经搞定！”\n据了解，在小米SU7新车主中，来自豪华车车主的换购比例超过50%，女性用户比例超过40%，苹果用户车主超过半数。\n在日前发布三季报时，小米明确，将全力冲刺2024年全年交付13万辆小米SU7系列新车的新目标。此前，小米SU7全年交付目标还是12万辆。\n更受市场关注的四门跑车小米汽车SU7 Ultra也在紧锣密鼓的推进。其售价81.49万元。\n据小米汽车内部人士透露，小米第二款车型计划于明年2、3月上市。这与雷军此前透露的“小米SU7 Ultra量产版将于2025年3月正式发布”的信息，在时间上有一致性。\n还有消息显示，小米第二款新车的上市安排将与此前SU7上市节奏一致。而SU7的上市时间恰好是2024年3月28日。\n对此，小米集团相关负责人只表示“相关问题已超纲”，他无法作出更多回应。\n不过这一预期点燃了二级市场的投资者热情。截至发稿，今天小米集团股价上涨1.42%。\n编辑/Rocky\nSource: Securities Times.\nAuthor: Wang Xiaowei\nWhile the delivery volume target for the Xiaomi SU7 continues to rise, certain functional malfunctions are also appearing.\nXiaomi SU7 is embroiled in a controversy over automatic parking system malfunctions. Recently, some media outlets have reported that over 70 Xiaomi SU7 standard edition car owners experienced scratches and collisions during parking due to malfunctions in the automatic parking function at specific times. The car owners surveyed come from various places such as Beijing, Tianjin, some of whom have publicly disclosed the malfunctions on social platforms, leading to the establishment of the 'Xiaomi SU7 Standard Edition Accident Car Owners Group.' Some car owners on short video platforms are warning 'not to use automatic parking.'\nCurrently, several car owners with malfunctions have contacted Xiaomi customer service multiple times and have taken their cars to Xiaomi 4S stores for data testing and analysis. Xiaomi officials have expressed willingness to shoulder all repair costs for the car owners and provide point compensation.\nAutomatic parking, also known as smart parking, allows the driver to drive the vehicle near the parking space, activate the automatic parking function, and the vehicle will identify the target parking space and park automatically.\nAccording to AI's determination, possible reasons for the malfunction of the automatic parking function include sensor malfunctions, software errors, electrical issues, with solutions involving checking and cleaning the sensors, updating software, and inspecting circuit connections.\nRecently, Xiaomi's \"Answering Questions from Netizens about Xiaomi Autos\" answered the question about whether the smart driving function of the Xiaomi SU7 can still be used in signal-free underground garages and if it can still automatically park.\nIt is stated that Xiaomi's asia vets parking function is not related to network signal, even without network signal, the Xiaomi asia vets parking function can still be used normally. All Xiaomi models are equipped with a customer parking assistance function based on an end-to-end model, capable of cruising at speeds up to 23km/h in underground garages. It accurately perceives lanes, obstacles in parking lots, and achieves obstacle avoidance and even reverse avoidance. The onboard asia vets chip completes all calculations, so the function does not require a network signal for implementation.\nThe second model is expected to be launched in February or March next year. On November 13th this year, Lei Jun announced on his personal Weibo that the 100,000th Xiaomi SU7 has officially rolled off the production line. \"For a new car company, the first car, after its release, only 230 days to roll off 0.1 million units, this is an unprecedented miracle,\" Lei Jun said.\nOn that day, Lei Jun posted a photo on his personal social account of himself sleeping on the factory floor and wrote: \"Netizens urged me to tighten screws at the factory. In fact, I often go there, and I arrived early this morning. I fell asleep in the workshop for a while because I came too early. Unexpectedly, when I woke up, 0.1 million units were already completed!\"\nIt is understood that among the new Xiaomi SU7 owners, the proportion of luxury car owners for replacement is over 50%, the proportion of female users exceeds 40%, and over half of the users are apple users.\nIn the recent release of the third-quarter report, Xiaomi clarified that it will fully push for a new target of delivering 0.13 million units of the Xiaomi SU7 series new cars in 2024. Previously, the annual delivery target for the Xiaomi SU7 was 0.12 million units.\nThe more market-focused four-door sports car Xiaomi Autos SU7 Ultra is also making rapid progress. Its selling price is 0.8149 million yuan.\nAccording to internal sources at Xiaomi Autos, Xiaomi's second model is planned to be launched in February or March next year. This is consistent with the information previously disclosed by Lei Jun that the \"Xiaomi SU7 Ultra production version will be officially released in March 2025.\"\nThere are also reports indicating that the launch of Xiaomi's second new car will follow the same pace as the previous SU7 launch. The exact launch time for the SU7 happened to be on March 28, 2024.\nIn response, the relevant person in charge at Xiaomi Group only stated that the \"relevant issues are beyond the scope,\" and he could not provide further response.\nHowever, this expectation has ignited enthusiasm among investors in the secondary market. As of the time of writing, Xiaomi Group's stock price has risen by 1.42% today.\nEditor/Rocky\nThe translation is provided by third-party software.\nThe above content is for informational or educational purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice related to Futu.

    "text": "Over 200 flight services were delayed at Delhi airport and dozens of trains were affected across North India on Friday morning as a thick layer of fog shrouded many states amid an extreme cold wave. According to flight monitoring website Flightradar, at least 72 departing flights have been delayed, and six have been cancelled at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. The arrival of 215 flights has been delayed, while 10 have been cancelled. At Kolkata airport, 17 departing flights were delayed, one was cancelled, and 36 arriving flights were also delayed.The runway visibility was zero at Delhi Airport on Friday morning, and airport authorities warned of potential disruptions to flight operations. IndiGo and Spicejet also cautioned against weather delays.At least 24 trains, including several long-distance services, are running late due to the foggy conditions, the Railways said. Some of these trains are delayed by up to 4.5 hours. The affected services include Karnaraka and Bihar Sampark Kranti Expresses, Bhatinda-Balurghat Farakka Express, Andhra Pradesh Express, Ayodhya Express among others. Due to reduced visibility from fog, a private bus and a truck collided in Punjab's Bathinda, causing injuries to 20 to 25 passengers.In the National Capital Region (NCR), this marked the fifth consecutive day of a cold wave, with the city experiencing a significant drop in maximum temperature. The India Meteorological Department has issued an orange warning for Delhi, anticipating \"dense to very dense fog\" and has also predicted a partly cloudy sky on Friday. In Noida, the district authorities announced that schools will remain closed for classes till 8 until further orders. The weather department has predicted a low of 8 degrees Celsius for Noida on Friday. States including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are also experiencing a severe cold wave accompanied by thick fog.As the mercury plummeted across several parts of Bihar, including the state capital Patna, the minimum temperatures are expected to remain between 6-11 degrees Celsius over the next three to four days. In response, the government has ordered changes in school timings. All schools will operate from 9 am to 4 pm until January 6. In Rajasthan's Fatehpur, located in the Sikar district, the lowest temperature recorded in the past 24 hours was 3.6 degrees Celsius.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch",
