    "title": "Taking the kids: 15+ fun ways for fun in the snow off the slopes",
    "text": "Maybe your idea of fun in the snow is cozying up to a fire with a good book. Maybe the idea of a moonlight snowshoe hike intrigues you. Perhaps a decadent dinner on the mountain that requires a sleigh or snow cat ride. How about racing the kids down a multi-lane tubing hill, ziplining, or a luxuriant day (or two) at the spa while the kids are busy taking ski lessons. Maybe it’s exploring a national park entirely differently.Yes, I used to plan our trips to the snow around time on the slopes. But with how expensive that can be for a family — and the uncertain quality of the snow in many parts of the country — I’ve begun thinking of other options now available to snow-loving families.I’ve also been thinking about how I can enjoy the snow after being hobbled by multiple knee surgeries this past year and how families with non-skiers and riders can equally enjoy a trip.“We just enjoy hanging out and cooking,” one young woman told me. She and her family gathered near Steamboat Springs, Colorado, for the holidays but she and her brother only spent one day on the slopes.One of her colleagues opined that she opted for two days at a spa rather than the slopes. “It was wonderful,” she said.Even traditional ski towns have a lot to offer off the slopes. Park City, Utah , for example, boasts 240 restaurants, fat tire biking, ice fishing, dog sledding, sleigh rides, snow tubing and your pick of spas. (A favorite of mine in ski country is the Spa Montage Deer Valley .)On select nights during ski season Elk Camp , Snowmass ’ on-mountain restaurant, which transforms on Ullr Nights into a nighttime winter wonderland with rides on the Breathtaker Alpine Coaster, snowbiking and more while at Woodward Copper at Copper Mountain Resort and Woodward Park City, aspiring half-pipe stars can practice their boarding and biking skills or bounce on Olympic-grade trampolines inside the massive action-sports facility. Breckenridge, Colorado, hosts the International Snow Sculpture Championships the last week in January drawing teams from around the world.We’ve visited Vista Verde Ranch in winter, near Steamboat Springs. The first time, we spent a day at the busy Steamboat Springs Resort, jockeying for a table at lunch, waiting in lift lines. But then we realized, there was so much to do at the ranch – horseback riding, snowshoeing and Nordic skiing, star gazing, snow biking, snowmobiling and a ll without the crowds. As ranch stays typically are all inclusive, we would just come in for lunch (perhaps a sampling of different chilis followed by homemade cookies) after a morning activity (there were terrific kids’ activities too. How about making snow graffiti?). The Dude Ranchers Association notes at least nine ranches from Western Pleasure Guest Ranch in Sandpoint, Idaho, to the Triangle X Ranch in Moose, Wyoming, near Jackson Hole and inside Grand Teton National Park (great wildlife viewing!) to Latigo Ranch and C Lazy U Ranch in Colorado. Last summer, we visited the ultra-luxe Brush Creek Ranch in southern Wyoming, which boasts its own ski mountain accessed only by snow cat , ice fishing, cooking classes (homegrown food from vegetables to beef to goat cheese) and winter wellness. How about snowshoeing with a Llama? (Check out their Valentine’s Day offerings and Snowfest Feb. 29 to March 3 with plenty of snow adventures.)REI Adventures offers winter group trips snowshoeing to Banff, Yosemite and Lake Tahoe, among the offerings.For those on a budget, consider the pooch-friendly YMCA of the Rockies and Snow Mountain Ranch in Colorado (opt for a cabin) where there are many complimentary activities, including complimentary guided snowshoe hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park, ending with cocoa and s’mores around the fire pit, crafts, indoor roller skating, basketball, pool, indoor climbing wall, and even a new hot cocoa truck and free rentals at the outdoor ice skating rink. (If you want a day on the slopes, you aren’t too far from Granby Ranch or Winter Park and can rent your gear at Snow Mountain Sports.) At Snow Mountain Ranch, there is new moonlight ski and snowshoe opportunities at their expansive Nordic Center and dog sledding and the chance to meet the new dog sled huskies.On the East Coast, the Appalachian Mountain Club offers affordable all-inclusive winter stays with guided activities, including for those “Wee Wanderer’s 4 to 6. (Kids stay and eat free during February school vacation weeks at Joe Dodge Lodge and the Highland Center.).In Massachusetts, consider Forest Bathing on a Mindful Monday with Adventure East amid the solitude of Chesterfield Gorge in West Chesterfield.We had a memorable trip to Yellowstone one winter when we snowshoed and came face to face with a buffalo near Old Faithful. There are special winter packages . (Want to learn more about wolves?) Tour by Snow Coach or snowmobile!North of the park in Montana, there’s Yellowstone Country where you could try ice climbing and legendary hot springs, among the snowy activities.For those who want to cozy up around a fire there are always vacation rentals. But if you prefer someone to wait on you (and make your bed!) consider a historic resort like Mohonk Mountain House only 90 miles from New York City. Founded in 1869 and voted the number one resort in 2023 by Conde Nast Traveler in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, it is surrounded by 40,000 acres of forts and is a national historic landmark. There are 30 miles of groomed trails for cross- country skiing or snowshoeing, winter hiking, outdoor ice skating, snow tubing and an award-winning spa.We’ve visited the historic (open in 1902) Omni Mount Washington Resort with its famous zipline and 25,000 square-foot spa. (The longest zip is over 1,000 feet long and about 165 feet high off the forest floor!) Check for special WINTER deals .In the Midwest, Destination Kohler in Wisconsin offers everything from curling to fat-tire biking, S’mores by an outdoor fire, even a hot chocolate bar. There are cabins as well as a hotel. (Stay three nights by March 31 and get a complimentary third nigh t.)Don’t forget your waterproof mittens and hand warmers.

    "title": "Manchester United segue sem vencer na Liga Europa e Lazio lidera com 100% de aproveitamento",
    "text": "O Manchester United deu sequência ao seu calvário nesta quinta-feira, na Liga Europa. Após abrir vantagem no placar, a equipe do técnico Erik ten Hag voltou a vacilar e teve de amargar um empate de 1 a 1, em Istambul. Foi a terceira igualdade do time inglês em três rodadas na competição.\nCom o resultado, o United vai se complicando na tabela. Com três pontos, a equipe vermelha ocupa a 20ª colocação na classificação. Já o Fenerbahçe chegou aos cinco pontos (uma vitória e dois empates até aqui).\nO técnico português José Mourinho acabou roubando a cena à beira do campo. Ele reclamou com a arbitragem da não marcação de um pênalti sobre Osayi-Samuel e acabou recebendo cartão vermelho.\nNo jogo, após pressão inicial dos donos da casa, os visitantes abriram o marcador aos 14 minutos. Garnacho escapou pela esquerda e serviu a Zirkzee. Ele deu assistência para Eriksen chutar da entrada da área: 1 a 0.\nA partir daí a pressão dos turcos cresceu e Onana operou um milagre aos 36 minutos para manter o United em vantagem. En-Nesyri cabeceou duas vezes em sequência, mas parou no goleiro rival.\nDe tanto pressionar, o Fenerbahçe achou o gol de empate na volta do intervalo. No cruzamento de Saint-Maximin, En-Nesyri, de cabeça, fez a festa da torcida local: 1 a 1, aos três minutos. A pressão permaneceu, o time turco foi todo para cima, mas não teve competência para transformar o empate em vitória.\nLAZIO VENCE MAIS UMA E LIDERA\nA Lazio fez mais uma vítima nesta quinta-feira em compromisso pelo torneio. O time do técnico Marco Baroni venceu o Twente por 2 a 0 em Enschede, na Holanda, e chegou aos nove pontos na classificação. Os italianos têm a mesma pontuação do Tottenham que também venceu na rodada (fez 1 a 0 no AZ Alkmaar) e do Anderlecht, que superou o Ludogorets.\nO primeiro gol do jogo saiu ainda no primeiro tempo. O atacante espanhol Pedro Rodriguez mostrou oportunismo para aproveitar a chance e balançar a rede. Perto do final do confronto, Gustav Isaksen garantiu a vitória da Lazio por 2 a 0.\nJá o Twente vive uma situação inversa. Ainda sem conseguir vencer no torneio, o time holandês permanece com apenas dois pontos na competição.\nVeja outros resultados de destaque nesta quinta-feira pela Liga Europa. O Eintracht Frankfurt recebeu o RFS e triunfou por 1 a 0. Jogando sob o apoio de sua torcida, o Ferencvaros também bateu o Nice pelo mesmo placar. A Real Sociedad levou a melhor como visitante e venceu o Maccabi Tel-Aviv por 2 a 1. O Ajax também conquistou três pontos fora de seus domínios ao fazer 3 a 0 no Qarabag. Jogando no estádio Olímpico, a Roma fez valer o mando de campo e superou o Dínamo Kiev pelo placar de 1 a 0.",

    "text": "Why Unique Content is Crucial for Your Website In today’s digital landscape, creating compelling and unique content⁣ is paramount‌ for success. A ​recent study revealed that a ​staggering 75% of B2B ‍marketers consider generating unique content essential for lead generation. Moreover, 71% of these marketers plan to considerably increase their content creation investments in the future. These statistics underscore⁤ the vital role unique content plays in driving online marketing efforts, such as building brand authority, optimizing search engine rankings, attracting traffic, and boosting conversions.\n“I love two ‍things in this world: sugar and⁣ myself.⁢ My constant tendency to please myself leads ⁤to the fact that I‍ consume huge amounts ‍of sugar every day. Oh God, I forgot ⁣about my ⁣husband. Sorry, I love three things in this ⁣world: sugar, myself and my husband,” as ‍ Nytimes.com⁤ writes Katie .⁤\nThe reasons behind this growing emphasis on unique content are multifaceted.First and foremost, users are inundated with information ⁢online.‌ To stand out‍ from the crowd, ​businesses must ‍offer fresh,‌ valuable, and engaging⁢ content that captures their ‍target audience’s ⁤attention.Search engines also prioritize websites ​that provide high-quality,original content. By creating unique and informative content, you can improve your website’s visibility and ranking in ⁤search results, leading to increased ⁣organic traffic.\nFurthermore,unique content serves as⁤ a powerful tool for building brand authority‍ and establishing trust with potential customers. ​When you consistently provide‍ valuable insights and share your expertise, you position yourself as a thought leader in your industry. this, in turn, can lead ⁢to increased brand credibility and ⁣customer loyalty.\nHealthy\n⁢ ⁣ ‍ Even seemingly innocuous over-the-counter medications can harbor unexpected dangers. Experts are raising alarm bells about ⁢the potential ‍side effects of a widely used drug,cautioning that even small doses ‌can lead to ​health complications.\n‌ ‌\nHeat: A Honey Myth Busted and 9 Others Debunked Honey, a golden liquid with a rich⁣ history and myriad uses, is⁣ often shrouded in myths and misconceptions.From its long shelf life⁤ to ‌its purported health benefits,many beliefs​ about this sweet substance have been ‍passed down through generations.\nOne ​such myth that‌ frequently ⁣surfaces is the idea that heat⁣ transforms honey into poison. This notion, however, is firmly debunked. While excessive heat can change the texture and quality of honey, making it grainy and potentially altering its flavor profile, it doesn’t turn it toxic. “Heat does ⁣slightly change the‍ taste and⁢ texture,” explains expert ⁢ [source needed], “but it​ doesn’t make it poisonous.”\nThis​ holds true for most honey-based dishes. While some recipes call for gently warming honey, extreme heat should be avoided.\nBeyond the heat myth, there⁣ are ⁢numerous other common ‍misconceptions surrounding honey that need addressing. Let’s ⁢delve into these fascinating facts ⁤and separate truth​ from fiction:\nMyth: ⁤ Honey never spoils.\nFact:\nWhile honey boasts impressive longevity thanks to its low moisture content ⁢and acidic pH, it ⁣can potentially spoil under certain conditions. Extreme⁢ temperature fluctuations, exposure ⁤to‌ moisture, and improper ‌storage can lead to the growth of bacteria and mold.\nMyth: Honey is solely a sweetener.\nfact:\nHoney is a nutritional powerhouse, serving as a⁢ natural‌ source of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.It can contribute to a healthy‌ diet ‌and may even⁢ offer soothing benefits for coughs and sore‌ throats.\n* Myth: All honey is created equal.\nFact:\nThe taste, color, and nutritional content of honey vary significantly depending on the floral source. Bees collect nectar from different flowers, resulting in a diverse array of honey types with unique characteristics.\nThese‌ are just ​a few examples of the many myths surrounding honey. By understanding these misconceptions and delving deeper into this fascinating substance,⁢ we can appreciate its true worth ​and incorporate it safely and effectively into our lives.\nA⁣ Sweet​ Struggle: ‍Living with an Unquenchable Sugar Craving There’s a palpable tension‌ in ⁣my home, a quiet battle fought⁣ over sweets. My husband, a⁤ staunch advocate for a healthy lifestyle, ​shuns sugar. Me? ⁣Well, let’s just say I have a rather insatiable sweet tooth.\nThe familiar scenario unfolds with predictable regularity.⁣ My husband, his brow⁣ furrowed, emerges from the kitchen, “Thirty empty candy wrappers in the trash,” he says,⁣ his voice a mix of⁤ disbelief and exasperation. “Any clarification?”\nI, sprawled comfortably on the couch, meet his gaze with a nonchalance I’d mastered over years of this silent ⁢war.”I haven’t the faintest idea,” I say, holding his gaze until he finally‌ sighs, defeated, and retreats.\nDoes this‌ sound like an exaggerated tale, designed for comedic effect? Maybe. But the truth is, the battle with my sweet cravings‌ is⁣ a real and constant struggle.​ it’s‌ a source of stress for‍ me and, I suspect, a constant head-scratcher for my husband.\nI⁢ envy those who find ‍satisfaction in a cup of coffee, a glass ⁢of wine, or a handful of cheese snacks in social settings. I can mimic these actions,taking ⁣a sip,savoring⁢ a taste,even pretending to indulge. But the reality is,⁢ none of these‌ things truly ⁢appeal to me. They hold no allure compared to the siren song of sugar.\nWhile ​my weight is healthy according ⁢to medical standards, I know my relationship with sugar is out of balance. It’s something I need ‌to‍ address, not just for​ my health, but for the sake of my ‌marriage and my own peace of⁢ mind.\nmy quest for Sugar Freedom: A Journey to Vivamayr My relationship with sugar was a intricate one. While my health markers ‍were generally good, I⁣ felt a nagging sense of unease. It was as if I was sleepwalking through life, unaware of a ⁣looming threat. “I’m afraid I’m like a woman in a horror movie who doesn’t understand​ she’s in⁢ a horror movie,” I confessed to myself. “She does not hear⁤ dramatic string instruments, so she⁢ does not realize⁤ that death‌ is⁣ coming. And I am afraid that my overwhelming desire⁢ for sugar is a symptom of a disease that‌ I can’t recognize, until one ​day I will suddenly have the fateful consequences.”\nI craved a change,a way to break⁣ free from the sugar cycle and embrace a healthier,more fulfilling life. I yearned for a structured plan, a guiding hand to lead me‌ towards a brighter future.My ‍search for⁣ a solution led ‌me to the world of luxury health resorts, places that promised to combine “health” with “luxury.”\nInstead of a clear path, I found myself drowning in a sea of emails. Every ⁢week, sometimes even daily, I received ⁢messages from resorts promising personalized programs and a customized approach to wellness. But ⁣none of them seemed to address my⁣ specific need: to ‌conquer my sugar cravings.\nThen, ‍I stumbled upon Vivamayr, a resort nestled in the ⁣heart of Southwest Austria. Their ⁣website, ​with its ice-blue “Typical Day” infographics, promised a radical approach. “This ⁢will feel like this in his new life,” the site declared. “Mentally and physically restored. Full of new perspectives.Lightweight, free⁢ and clear. Cheerful ⁢and full of‍ energy.” While these promises sounded a bit ⁤too good ‍to be true, I⁣ was intrigued. After ⁤all, who wouldn’t want to feel “mentally and physically restored”?\nThe resort boasted endorsements from‍ celebrities like Rebel‌ Wilson and Elizabeth Hurley, adding to its allure. “But ⁤actress Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Herley absolutely adore this place,” ⁢I thought. “And who else can I‌ trust in life,if not Rebel ⁢Wilson and Elizabeth Herley?”\nVivamayr’s commitment ⁢to structure and rigor⁢ appealed ‍to my desire for a clear⁢ path.

    "text": "Portland-based marriage counselor and therapist Jeff Ganter often shares advice for couples on his social media, and in one of his videos he listed five important things to pay attention to after your first fight. The initial phase of a relationship is similar to a honeymoon, however it has to end at some point, usually with the first fight. Of course, arguments are part of a relationship and don't have to be a major problem. However, after the first fight, Jeff says you need to pay attention to the following five things that could be a problem in the future. The other side attacks your character If the other party can't stay focused on the thing that caused the argument and instead makes you feel bad about who you are, it will be difficult to stay on topic and work things out. The other side keeps telling you that your feelings are wrong Feelings are not wrong. You cannot experience an incorrect emotion. Canceling what you feel is not a good start. The other side is insulting you This is a sign of deep disrespect and inability to resolve conflicts in a mature and constructive manner. While it's normal to feel upset, harsh words or insults can damage trust and respect in a relationship and are just mean. The other side becomes the expert on what happened If the other side persistently explains what exactly happened and leaves no room for you and your experience, the whole story is one-sided, which is not good. The other party cannot reconnect and release the argument If the other side becomes cold and cautious, if it continues to punish you, there is a high probability that things will stay like this for a long time and the situation could get even worse.

    "title": "Ukraine launches drone attacks on Moscow",
    "text": "Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones that were shot down by air defenses in what Russian officials called one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since its special military operation in Ukraine began in February 2022.\nThe conflict, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on August 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers over the border into Russia's western Kursk region.\nFor months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - have been rarer.\nRussia's defense ministry said its air defenses destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region.\nSome of the drones were shot down over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. The city, located in the Moscow region, is some 38 km south of the Kremlin.\n\"This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever,\" Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday. \"The layered defense of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs.\"\nAlong Moscow's boulevards, cafes, restaurants and shops of the capital - which has been carefully insulated from the conflict - were crowded with little signs of concern.\nMoscow's airports, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky, limited flights for four hours but restarted normal operations early in the morning, Russia's aviation watchdog said.\nSobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported following the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, wrote on Telegram.\nUkrainian military's General Staff said in a statement that it struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Russia's southern Rostov region overnight.\nRostov governor Vasily Golubev said air defense forces had destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over his region, but Russia's defense ministry made no mention of the incident in its daily statement on destroyed air weapons.\nIn Russia's north Murmansk region, local authorities issued a drone attack warning on Wednesday, as local airports imposed flight restrictions following unverified reports of an unmanned aircraft being shot down.\nShortly before the announcement, civil aviation authorities introduced flight restrictions at airports in the regional capital, Murmansk, and the town of Apatity.\nNo drone attacks have previously been reported in the Murmansk region before. If confirmed, Wednesday's reported drone downing would mark the furthest a Ukrainian drone has flown into Russian territory.\nRussia meanwhile is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18 percent of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War II.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday Ukraine had not consulted Berlin about its August 6 shock incursion into Russia and that he expected that military operation to be limited in time and territory.\n\"Ukraine has prepared its military operation in the Kursk region very secretly and without feedback, which is certainly due to the situation,\" Scholz said. \"This is a very limited operation in terms of space and probably also in terms of time.\"\nSeparately, Scholz said Germany would continue to be what he said was Ukraine's biggest supporter in Europe after controversy in recent days over what some have called wavering German support for Kyiv over domestic politicking.\nRelated news Ukrainian drone attack intercepted, Russia says\n2023-07-05 Drone attack kills 6 IS insurgents in E.

    "text": "By Liz Lee\nBEIJING (Reuters) – Year-end holidaymakers across China were bracing for possible transport disruptions after the weather bureau on Friday warned that heavy fog and haze would shroud areas from Hebei province in the north to southern Shanghai for the next 24 hours.\nThe Central Meteorological Observatory issued its first red alert for fog since 2017. Conditions were expected to improve from Saturday evening, when a cold wave of air is expected to blow over the country.\nSevere foggy conditions were expected in parts of northern province Hebei, central province Henan, eastern provinces Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong as well as in the municipalities Shanghai and Chongqing from Friday morning, the National Meteorological Centre said.\nDense fog in predicted in parts of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai leading to low visibility of less than 200 metres, and less than 50 metres in some areas.\nIn the north and areas between the Yellow River and Huai River, light to moderate haze is forecast, with heavy haze affecting Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan.\nThe severe weather was due to high humidity and poor atmospheric diffusion conditions, the forecaster said.\nChina has experienced a year of climate extremes.\nLast week, most of the country was hit by a cold snap that rewrote records with sub-freezing temperatures, in contrast to the summer, when scorching heat that breached 52 degree Celsius (125.6 Fahrenheit) in the northwest blistered the country.\nSummer storms also brought record rainfall to Beijing and flooding elsewhere.\nOn Friday, the central observatory told the public to tune into weather and traffic alerts, and advised them to reduce time outdoors. Residents in parts of Shandong, Anhui and in Jiangsu should avoid going out unless necessary, it added.\n“You can’t see clearly the road conditions and traffic lights ahead,” the observatory said on social media.\nIn Shanghai, some ferry routes were temporarily suspended and some sections of highways, as well as a bridge to a container port, were temporarily closed. At the city’s Bund waterfront, a thick grey fog all but obscured the colourful skyscrapers across from it.\nIn Jiangsu, some sections of several expressways remained shut since Thursday evening, while Hebei and Henan temporarily closed segments of multiple highways on Friday morning, citing weather conditions, according to state television CCTV and provincial capital authorities said.\n(Reporting by Liz Lee and Shanghai newsroom; editing by Miral Fahmy)",

    "text": "Up North: Basketball court continues legacy of Brady VanHove\nBrady VanHove was taken from this world at 21 years old in a tragic accident. Last weekend, a brand new basketball court opened up in his name in Hawthorne, Wisconsin, celebrating his life and the sport he loved so much.\n“Basketball was his life. Like the kid just couldn’t put down a ball,” said Missy Haworth, Brady’s mother.\nBrady VanHove was a basketball player through and through.\nA massive Minnesota Timberwolves fan and a Northwestern Tiger from 6th grade to senior year, Brady couldn’t get enough of the game.\n“The love of the game of the basketball was from second grade until he passed away at twenty one. He knew everything else about every other sport and person, but as far as what he did, he played basketball all the time. He was shooting around at the YMCA two days before he passed away,” said Haworth.\nAt 21 years old, Brady died from injuries sustained in an industrial accident in 2020. A quiet kid in high school, but a force to be reckoned with on the court.\nBrady’s love for the game comes from his family.\n“My dad started at his house in Maple. He had a garage that had a hoop up on the garage and took him out there and started shooting around with him at a very young age and encouraged him to play basketball, took him to camps in Madison,” said Missy Haworth.\nOne of his idols was Duke University star and former Minnesota Timberwolves forward Christian Laettner.\n“He was my idol growing up, watching them play for Duke,” said Missy. “Phenomenal. He came and did a basketball coaching clinic in Ashland when Brady was, I think, in 10th or 11th grade. He went to that camp for a week and got to meet Christian Laettner and we have pictures of the three of us together. So yeah, it was very cool. He got his shoes signed by him and he never wore them again after that.”\nFive years after Brady’s death, the Haworths have the first public court in the area up and running.\n“After we lost Brady, we knew we had to do something to honor him and to carry on his legacy,” said Ryan Haworth. “One of the things we talked about was a basketball court, and thankfully the town of Hawthorne was good enough to work with us and here we are today. It’s been about a one year process from start to finish. Basically we just wanted to be able to honor Brady and carry on his legacy and other kids can enjoy it, that’s the biggest thing. A lot of people don’t even know this park is here let alone this court so it’s good to see kids using it and playing on it.”\nFriends, family, former coaches and members of the community laced up their sneakers and shot the first handful of shots on Brady’s court.\n“He should be here. I say that all the time. 21 year old kid with his whole life ahead of him. My soul aches every day without him. He literally was what I say, it sounds weird maybe, but I say he was the love of my life. The kid was attached to me from the day I gave birth to him,” said Missy. “I mean, I did everything for him. I drove them hours and hours up and down the state of Wisconsin to play basketball, I spoiled him with hundreds of pairs of fancy basketball shoes and jerseys, because he just was such a great kid and he didn’t give us any grief. “\nWhat Brady would have wanted is for the court to be put to good use, and for there to be never-ending buckets.",
