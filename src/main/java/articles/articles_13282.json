    "title": "Greg Kihn, Pop Star Who Had a Big Hit With \"Jeopardy,\" Dies at 75",
    "text": "Greg Kihn, Pop Star Who Had a Big Hit With &quot;Jeopardy,&quot; Dies at 75 Greg Kihn, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and West Coast pop star best known for his bouncy hit &quot;Jeopardy,&quot; which made it to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 before being parodied by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, has died. He was 75. Kihn died Tuesday after a battle with Alzheimer&#039;s, publicist Michael Brandvold announced. His family did not want to disclose the location of his death. Kihn blended folk, classic rock, blues and melodic pop in a style that helped define the Bay Area music scene in the 1980s. His first hit was &quot;The Breakup Song (They Don&#039;t Write ‘Em),&quot; which got to No. 15 on the Hot 100 in May 1981. The Greg Kihn Band released the danceable &quot;Jeopardy&quot; in January 1983, and only Michael Jackson&#039;s &quot;Beat It&quot; kept from nabbing the No. 1 spot. A huge MTV favorite, it was quickly spoofed by Yankovic as &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy,&quot; which even featured the host of the game show, Art Fleming, and its announcer, Don Pardo. (Kihn&#039;s song was about a relationship going bad.) Kihn gave Weird Al permission to make his song and was seen at the end of Yankovic&#039;s music video as the driver of a convertible. Gregory Stanley Kihn was born in Baltimore on July 10, 1949. His father, Stanley, was an inspector for the city health department. Watching The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 for the first time was &quot;a life-altering event,&quot; he said. When he was 17, his mother, Jane, submitted a tape of one of his songs to local radio station WCAO, and from that he won a Vox electric guitar. He moved in San Francisco in 1974, signed with Matthew Kaufman&#039;s Beserkley Records and released his first album, fronting his own ensemble, in 1976. His LPs also included 1981&#039;s Rockihnroll, 1982&#039;s Kihntinued, 1983&#039;s Kihnspiracy, 1984&#039;s Kihntageous, 1985&#039;s Citizen Kihn, 1986&#039;s Love &amp; Rock &amp; Roll, 1994&#039;s Mutiny, 1996&#039;s Horror Show and 2017&#039;s Rekihndled. Kihn was a popular morning host on the San Jose, California-based station KUFX-FM (known as KFOX) for 17 years through 2018. He also published several horror novels and edited a collection of short stories written by the likes of Ray Davies, Pete Townshend and Joan Jett. He had an interesting hobby - breeding rare praying mantises - and donated time and money to Operation Care and Comfort. Survivors include his wife, Jay; children Ryan and Alexis; son-in-law Samora; grandsons Nate and Zuri; sister Laura; brother-in-law Lou; and nephews Larry, Lou and Matthew. A private memorial celebration is planned, as is a public celebration of life concert. Donations in his honor can be made to the Alzheimer&#039;s Association. More from The Hollywood Reporter",

    "text": "Spring isn’t the only thing in the air over southern Ontario this week.\nA low-pressure system south of the border will graze the region to end the week, producing a bout of snow that’ll start Friday evening and continue into the overnight hours.\nExpect slow traffic and slippery roads late Friday as the snow begins around the evening commute for many areas, including Toronto and Hamilton. Stay aware of your local road conditions before heading out, and be wary of rapidly deteriorating roads.\nSEE ALSO: April 8 solar eclipse is the must-see celestial event this spring\nFriday into Saturday AM: Snow spreads across southern Ontario We’re usually used to the snow by the end of the cool season—but Canada’s warmest winter on record did a number on Toronto’s snowfall totals. We’ve only seen about 55 cm of snow since November, and it’s been pretty evenly spread out.\nToronto’s largest one-day snowfall this season was a paltry 6.4 cm that fell on February 15, with the city’s greatest two-day snowfall was 7.6 cm that fell between January 11-12.\nThe relative lack of impactful snow we’ve seen in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) this season will increase the risk for travel issues once the snow begins on Friday.\nA Colorado low sweeping into the Great Lakes is responsible for this impending spell of winter weather across southern Ontario.\nWe’ll already have cold air in place as the system tracks over Lake Erie and Lake Ontario through the day Friday. Warmer air is just over the border, though, which makes this a dicey situation if the storm shifts even a little bit off its predicted track.\nSnow will begin pushing into far southwestern Ontario on Friday morning before pushing into the GTA by Friday afternoon. Folks in eastern Ontario will see the snow arrive by Friday night.\nDON’T MISS: Mild winter to blame for early pollen release in southern Ontario\nCommuters around the GTA can expect widespread snow as Friday progresses, with heavier snow developing by the Friday evening commute as our low-pressure system intensifies over the region.\nA slight jog to the north in the storm’s track will push warmer air closer to the border, which could allow for some mixed precipitation or rain on the shores of Lake Erie.\nEasterly winds blowing off Lake Ontario could enhance snowfall rates a bit in the Golden Horseshoe, helping to slightly increase snowfall totals around Toronto and Hamilton.\nSnow will taper off for most of southern Ontario overnight Friday into the wee morning hours on Saturday.\nWidespread snowfall totals of 5-10 cm are expected from Windsor straight up Highway 401 toward Cornwall. Accumulations of about 10 cm are likely right around the Golden Horseshoe, which could bring Toronto its largest single snowfall of the season.\nGreater uncertainty exists around the National Capital Region as a storm track farther south would bring Ottawa minimal snows.\n5-10 cm of snow isn’t much in the grand scheme of weather hazards. But it’s plenty to make roads slippery, especially as the sun goes down. Add in traffic during Friday evening’s commute, as well as the fact that many drivers have removed their winter tires for the season, and this setup raises the risk for slowdowns and accidents throughout the region.\nLooking ahead, calmer conditions will prevail across southern Ontario this weekend as below-seasonal temperatures settle over the region. Forecasters are watching a potential warm-up next week as southerly winds blow ahead of our next low-pressure system expected to approach the Great Lakes.\nStay with The Weather Network for all the latest on your forecast across Ontario.\nWATCH: Snow squalls take over Ontario as spring officially starts",

Photo: Fox 9/Youtube\nA Minnesota first responder not only saved one kitten's life, but also gave it a forever home.\nIn February, Coon Rapids Community Service Officer Eric Prindle responded to a grass fire that started at a homeless encampment in Coon Rapids, Minn. Upon arrival, a small injured kitten, who belonged to one of the people at the encampment, was found in the field.\n\"I went and looked at it and realized we need to get this thing care right away,\" Prindle told FOX9 in an interview published on Monday, April 21.\nHe then took the cat, named JJ, to the Animal Humane Society in Coon Rapids to ensure he would survive his eye injuries and severe facial burns. JJ's whiskers and a portion of his ears were burnt off.\nPrindle confessed that once he was driving to the Animal Humane Society, he thought to himself, “ ‘Please don’t be dead in my backseat,’ ” he told FOX9 , adding, “And then I saw he was alive.”\nTruck Driver and Police Officer Stop Traffic on Busy Florida Highway to Rescue Tiny Kitten \"It was one of those situations where I was very concerned he wasn’t going to make it,\" Animal Humane Society veterinarian Dr. Kate Farmer said. \"He was kind of a long shot, but we wanted to give him a chance.”\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThroughout JJ’s recovery, Prindle continued to visit the kitten, because “he just touched me,\" Prindle said.\nMichigan Firefighters Help Rescue Curious Kitten Stuck in Car Muffler Once JJ grew stronger, Prindle and his wife adopted the kitten and brought him into his new forever home, where “he’s adjusting real good,\" Prindle said.\n\"Watching his progress through the whole thing was just amazing,\" Prindle told FOX9.\nJJ still needs ointment around his scars, but his whiskers are beginning to grow back, and he’s beginning to live life as a normal cat — and get along well with Prindle’s dog, Twinkie.\n\"It was amazing actually to see his remarkable capacity to heal and his emotional resilience to get through something that must have been awful,\" Farmer said.\nClose Leave a Comment",

Evite tomar banho e falar ao telefone. Desligue aparelhos eletrônicos da tomada para precaver danos. Busque abrigo em casas; prédios ou no interior de carros (sem encostar na parte exterior da lataria).\nComo se proteger de inundações?\nO que fazer ANTES:\nÉ importante ter definido um lugar seguro onde você e sua família possam se abrigar. Coloque documentos e objetos de valor em sacos plásticos bem fechados e em local protegido. Ao sinal de inundação, deixe móveis, eletrodomésticos, produtos de limpeza e alimentos fora do alcance da água. Desconecte os aparelhos elétricos da tomada. Feche portas e janelas da casa caso seja necessário o abandono, para evitar a entrada de escombros e de animais peçonhentos. Ao evacuar uma residência, feche os registros de gás e água e, se possível, acione a companhia elétrica para desligar a luz do local. Lembre-se de garantir a segurança também dos animais de estimação.\nO que fazer DURANTE:\nProteja a sua vida, a de seus familiares e amigos indo para um terreno ou um andar mais alto. Evite contato com águas de inundação para não contrair doenças. Não cruze pontes, ruas ou avenidas alagadas. Procure sempre um lugar elevado para estacionar. Águas de inundação são pesadas e violentas. Mesmo que você saiba nadar, não se arrisque em travessias ou brincadeiras. Apenas 15 cm de água em movimento podem derrubá-lo, e 30 cm de água em movimento são suficientes para arrastar o veículo. Se estiver fora de casa, em um local seguro (escola/empresa), permaneça e avise sua família que está em segurança.\nO que fazer DEPOIS:\nNão volte para casa até as águas baixarem e o caminho estar seguro. Procure por trincas e estufamento nas paredes, para verificar se sua casa não pode desabar. Remova a lama e o lixo do chão, das paredes, dos móveis e utensílios e lave e desinfete os objetos que tiveram contato com as águas da inundação. Bebidas e alimentos que tiveram contato com as águas da inundação devem ser descartados, pois podem estar contaminados. Não use equipamentos elétricos que tenham sido molhados. Após as águas baixarem, faça a limpeza usando botas e luvas de borracha. Animais peçonhentos podem estar escondidos em sua casa.\n🚨 Para quem ligar?\nEm caso de emergências, ligue para o telefone 193 do Corpo de Bombeiros. Avise a Defesa Civil pelo t elefone 199 sobre alagamentos e inundações. Por esse número, você também pode pedir vistoria em imóveis que tenham sido afetados pela chuva e nos casos de queda de árvore em via pública ou imóveis. É importante também cadastrar seu número de telefone celular para receber os alertas da Defesa Civil. Para isso, basta enviar um SMS com o seu CEP para o número 40199 .\nVÍDEOS: tudo sobre Campinas e região\n50 vídeos Veja mais notícias sobre a região no g1 Campinas\nBarretos Campinas Franca Ribeirão Preto",

    "text": "Clasificado El Diario La mejor forma de comprar y vender - Visitar\nLuego de recorrer solos miles de kilómetros o de ser guiados por los grupos dedicados al tráfico de personas, entre enero y noviembre de 2023 un total de 19 mil 690 niños, niñas y adolescentes migrantes no acompañados fueron asegurados por los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza del Sector El Paso o por los oficiales de la Oficina de Campo de El Paso de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP).\nSegún las cifras oficiales, durante 2023 en promedio cada 24.4 minutos un menor migrante ingresó solo a Estados Unidos a través del sector que abarca cerca de 432 kilómetros de la frontera con Chihuahua, desde Janos hasta el Valle de Juárez, expuesto a diversos daños físicos y mentales.\nCasi la mitad de ellos, 8 mil 917 fueron NNA provenientes de Guatemala, pero las autoridades estadounidenses también reportaron el ingreso de menores de México, El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Perú, Colombia, Brasil, Venezuela, Cuba, Haití, Turquía y Ucrania, entre otras nacionalidades.\nDel total, 18 mil 550 menores no acompañados fueron encontrados por los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza en el Sector El Paso, tras haber ingresado solos a Estados Unidos de manera irregular, a través del río Bravo/grande, el desierto de Nuevo México, la red de alcantarillado de El Paso o fueron ubicados en casas de seguridad o en vehículos en los que eran transportados en las carreteras estadounidenses.\nEn enero fueron encontrados mil 860 de ellos en la frontera, en febrero 2 mil 012, en marzo 2 mil 286, en abril 2 mil 033, en mayo mil 469, en junio mil 022, en julio mil 288, en agosto mil 785, en septiembre mil 898, en octubre mil 346 y mil 551 en noviembre.\nSegún las estadísticas del gobierno de Joe Biden, la cifra disminuyó un 22.82 por ciento respecto al mismo período de 2022, cuando sumaron 24 mil 036 los asegurados, mientras que el año terminó con 26 mil 790 menores encontrados por la Patrulla Fronteriza sin la compañía de sus padres en el Sector El Paso.\nEn cambio, la cifra de NNA migrantes no acompañados que fueron procesados en los puertos oficiales de entrada a Estados Unidos por la Oficina de Campo de El Paso de CBP incrementó un 161.46 por ciento, al pasar de 436 de enero a noviembre de 2022 –cuando sumaron un total de 495 hasta diciembre–, a mil 140 durante los primeros once meses de 2023.\nRepuntó en agosto\nEn enero de este año fueron 59 los menores solos procesados por CBP, 48 en febrero, 83 en marzo, 35 en abril, 88 en mayo, 134 en junio, 138 en julio, 164 en agosto, 118 en septiembre, 118 en octubre y 155 durante noviembre.\n“Los migrantes vulnerables, adultos y niños, son persuadidos fácilmente por contrabandistas criminales que no tienen en cuenta el bienestar de las personas. No hay garantías en los acuerdos hechos con estos contrabandistas sin escrúpulos. Los migrantes pueden sufrir un estrés financiero temporal, pero lo más crítico es el daño permanente e irreversible a su salud mental y física”, alertó la Patrulla Fronteriza del Sector El Paso a los padres que piensan enviar a sus hijas o hijos solos hacia Estados Unidos.\n“Las organizaciones criminales transnacionales han demostrado, una y otra vez, su desprecio hacia la vida de los migrantes. Las organizaciones criminales tratan a los migrantes como una mercancía y los colocan constantemente en situaciones peligrosas. Si un migrante resulta herido o lesionado, en la mayoría de los casos, los traficantes lo abandonan en zonas desérticas remotas y muchos han sucumbido solos a sus heridas”, destacó la autoridad encargada de vigilar la frontera entre los puertos oficiales de entrada a Estados Unidos.\nEntre los 59 menores que ingresaron en promedio diariamente a Estados Unidos a través del Sector El Paso este año, se encontraron dos pequeños guatemaltecos que llegaron el 22 de enero hasta el bordo estadounidense.\nMientras que cientos de familias y adultos solos hacían fila junto al muro fronterizo para ser recibidos por los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza, una niña y un niño, quienes desde la distancia se observaban menores de ocho años, cruzaron el río internacional entre Ciudad Juárez y El Paso pese a la sensación térmica que en esos momentos era de 0 grados centígrados.\nAl darse cuenta que se trataba de dos menores solos, un grupo de migrantes los colocaron hasta el frente, en donde permanecieron envueltos en una cobija, frente a la malla metálica colocada junto al muro fronterizo, y mientras esperaban a ser recogidos, comieron galletas y la comida, al parecer sopa instantánea, que les dieron los agentes estadounidenses.\nDebido al intenso frio que se sentía, el niño se envolvió completamente en la cobija, mientras que la niña le cuidaba un muñeco de plástico que llevaba y permanecía atenta a la llegada de los agentes que los recogerían en la frontera.\nDistintas caras del éxodo\nEl 81.3 por ciento de los menores que salen solos de aquél país, lo hacen en busca de mejores condiciones de vida, el 46.5 con el objetivo de reunirse con sus familias y el 25.7 por motivos laborales, reveló la Encuesta de Hogares de Movilidad Humana sobre Niñez y Adolescencia Migrante no Acompañada Retornada a Guatemala, realizada de septiembre a noviembre de 2022 por la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM).\nLa mejora en las condiciones de vida se relaciona con satisfacer sus necesidades alimentarias (85.4 por ciento), tener acceso a vivienda digna (75.8 por ciento), educación (82.2 por ciento) y mejorar el acceso a servicios de salud (62.3 por ciento).\nEl 14.7 por ciento de quienes buscan la reunificación familiar se reuniría con su madre, el 15.7 por ciento con el padre, el 5.1 por ciento con ambos padres, y el 66.5 por ciento con otro pariente distinto a los antes mencionados.\nDe acuerdo con las autoridades estadounidenses, la mayoría de los menores no acompañados son adolescentes. Y según la encuesta de la OIM, de quienes viajan solos por motivos laborales, el 59.6 por ciento indicó que los trabajos a los que tenían acceso en su país eran eventuales o inestables. Y, un 52.8 por ciento dijo que el salario era muy bajo para cubrir sus necesidades básicas.",

    "text": "Best Windows Laptop for 2025\nLooking for a new laptop? Check out our favorite Windows laptops, tested and reviewed by CNET's laptop experts.\nIf the laptop announcements at CES 2025 from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others have you thinking about an upgrade, then you’ve arrived at the right place. Below you’ll find our favorite Windows laptops that CNET experts have tested and reviewed. These models were all released in 2024 but will stick around for a while longer -- and often at deep discounts. It’ll be a few months before many of the laptops unveiled at CES will become available. The best Windows models from 2024 offer plenty of performance and battery life to provide a long lifespan. Keep reading to see our current favorites, and you can also check out the best laptops from CES.\nOur Picks\nThe best Windows laptops come in all shapes and sizes\nWe really like the look and long battery life of the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 Copilot Plus PC, but the HP Pavilion Plus 14 remains our pick as the best overall Windows laptop. It doesn't have the battery life of the Surface Laptop 7, but it also lacks the potential compatibility issues you might run into with a laptop with neither an Intel nor an AMD CPU but an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor. We love the Pavilion Plus 14 for its all-metal enclosure, strong performance and gorgeous OLED display. Sitting between the meat-and-potatoes Pavilion line and the higher-end Envy line, the Pavilion Plus series offers attractive features at affordable prices.\nThe Pavilion Plus 14 would make a good match for many people shopping for a Windows laptop. Other models we've tested and reviewed are great fits for narrower audiences, from budget models and two-in-one convertibles to high-powered gaming laptops. With decades of experience testing and reviewing laptops, our laptop experts conduct performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and also perform extensive hands-on tests to assess the design, features and performance of each laptop we review.\nYou'll find a good number of recommendations here, but we also have more specific picks in different laptop categories, starting with the best overall laptop and also including the best gaming laptop, best cheap gaming laptop, best laptop for college students and best two-in-one laptop. If you narrowed it to a specific brand, check out our picks for the best Dell laptop and best HP laptop. Beyond Windows, we have recommendations for the [best MacBook](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-macbook/) and [best Chromebook](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-chromebook/).\nThere are a lot of Windows laptops. A lot. Which makes narrowing it down to just one more than a little tricky. The HP Pavilion Plus is exemplary because it can meet the needs of a lot of people while still being affordable. It’s available in 14- and 16-inch sizes; we tested the 14-inch model, which is small enough for travel but big enough that you won’t feel cramped while working. HP offers AMD and Intel processors, which can also be configured with entry-level discrete graphics. There are also multiple displays to match your budget, including a beautiful OLED panel.\nThe starting price is $1,000, but HP regularly discounts it by hundreds of dollars. We tested an AMD model, and HP still sells both AMD and Intel configurations of the Pavilion Plus 14, but the customizable model with the cheap OLED upgrade is now an Intel-based unit with a Core Ultra CPU. We recommend getting that OLED screen; It adds only $60 to the package and is worth it -- especially when you can find it on sale and get the OLED upgrade for little more than $700 in total. That's a great price for a well-rounded, well-built laptop with an OLED display.\nPower in motion. AI-ready. The XPS 14 balances performance and mobility in a striking form factor. Create on the go with its lightweight 3.7-pound design, slim 18mm size and long battery life. It's powered by AI-enabled Intel Core Ultra processors.\nThe Surface Laptop 7 reverses earlier Arm-based efforts that were plagued by lackluster performance and limited compatibility. Many x86 apps were unable to run on an Arm-based system. This time around, performance has improved, and so has compatibility.\nWe saw a strong overall performance from the Snapdragon X Elite processor and jaw-dropping battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that’s the longest runtime of any 13- or 14-inch laptop we ever reviewed -- including the M3 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air in performance and battery life and supplies a similarly sleek and solid build.\nWe wish there was an OLED display option, and you’ll need to do a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7, but if you can get past those hurdles, then you’ll get a well-built, good-looking and long-running Windows ultraportable. You don't necessarily need to spend the roughly $2,000 that our test system costs; one of the lower-priced configurations that starts at $900 should meet the needs of most people.\nDell’s new Copilot Plus PC lasted for more than 23 hours on our YouTube streaming battery drain test. That's longer than any laptop we've tested in the past year and one of the longest laptop runtimes we have ever seen.\nInspiron 14 Plus 7441’s design is fairly basic and doesn't match the sleekness of Microsoft’s own Copilot Plus PC, the Surface Laptop 7, or Apple’s MacBook Air, but the Inspiron 14 Plus 7441 still supplies a rigid, all-metal chassis and crisp, 2.5K IPS display. At just $800, it's a bit more affordable than Microsoft’s and Apple’s models and is a great pick for a general-purpose, long-lasting laptop.\nThe Dell XPS 16 9640 has a striking, minimalistic design that features a borderless touchpad, a nearly flat keyboard with little to no spacing between the keys and a Function row that consists not of physical keys but touch-sensitive icons. Powering the 4K OLED display is a powerful duo of an Intel Core Ultra CPU and up to RTX 4070 graphics.\nAt $3,200, our XPS 16 9640 test system costs less than the $3,999 configuration of the mostly maxed-out MacBook Pro 16 we tested at the end of last year but is still at the high-end of the premium laptop class. It offers the design and performance that befits its price and Dell's numerous customization options mean you can likely land on a configuration that meets your needs and budget.\nIt delivers no surprises or revolutionary upgrades from past iterations, but the ThinkPad X1 Carbon's security features, build quality and performance remain excellent. Its 14-inch display and 2.5-pound weight are the sweet spot of enough screen space to work long stretches without needing to connect to an external display, while also being light enough for daily travel. With an industry-best keyboard, long battery life and greener construction, the X1 Carbon Gen 11 is a near-perfect business laptop.\nLenovo has increased pricing from previous Gen 11 to Gen 12 models to where we've reached a point where the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is no longer our recommendation for business execs unless your organization is large enough to qualify for volume pricing. For individual buyers, it's simply too expensive for the performance, and battery life it provides. For most business users, the previous Gen 11 is the better buy -- especially for just $1,349 at Walmart.\nFor just $300, Acer’s entry-level Aspire Go 14 holds its own against other budget models that cost twice as much or even more. The design can't be described as enticing or exciting, but it's functional and unlikely to offend. Performance from the quad-core AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series CPU and 8GB of RAM suffices for basic use, and its battery life is surprisingly long.\nThe 14-inch display features a modern 16:10 aspect ratio and is sufficiently bright, but it suffers from poor viewing angles that might take some getting used to before you settle on the right angle to position the display. Another drawback is the tight storage of the laptop’s meager 128GB SSD. Neither drawback is a deal-breaker when you consider the bargain-basement price. The Aspire Go 14 provides great value with its acceptable build quality, capable performance and long battery life.\nLike other gaming laptop makers, Acer has two lines: a budget-friendly Nitro series and midrange and premium models that carry the Predator label. Oddly enough, it's under the latter you'll find our budget gaming pick: the Helios Neo 16. It's strikingly similar to the Acer Nitro 16 but with slightly better build quality and graphics performance. The only place it really faltered was its speakers, which put out disappointingly flat audio with nonexistent bass.\nThe Predator Helios Neo 16 with a Core i5 CPU and RTX 4050 graphic cost $1,200 when we reviewed it. That model is no longer available, but a higher-end Core i7/RTX 4060 model is for just $1,150.\nOne of the first of the new generation of 18-inch laptops, the m18 is now in its second R2 iteration. It can get expensive if you push it up to a high configuration -- an RTX 4090 and Core i9-14900HX exceeds $3,000. If the big screen is most important to you, it starts at $1,900 with a respectable Core i7-14650HX and RTX 4060. Don't expect great battery life, and the fans can get loud when you're pushing it.\nWith its excellent build quality, adequate display, strong performance and lengthy runtime, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use or students. It's a great deal at its price of $900 at Best Buy and an even better deal at its regularly discounted price of $800 direct from Lenovo. We like its solid, all-metal chassis and the power and efficiency you get from its AMD Ryzen 7 8000-series CPU. It lacks some of the refinement and extras you get with Lenovo’s flagship Yoga 9i 14, but the midrange Yoga 7 14 is much more affordable and the better pick for most people.\nTwo items help make the Microsoft Surface Pro 11 our favorite two-in-one detachable laptop: Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Elite X processor and an excellent OLED display. The Arm-based CPU delivers competitive performance and far fewer compatibility issues for mainstream use than previous Windows-on-Arm efforts. It helps the Surface Pro 11 deliver a long runtime. The 13-inch OLED display supplies a crisp, 2.8K resolution along with P3 calibration and real HDR capability. It's the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in a while, but you still have to pay extra for a keyboard and stylus.\nThe Surface Pro 11 starts at $1,000 but costs can quickly escalate. For example, the Flex keyboard with Slim pen adds a hefty $450 to our test system, which costs $1,700 for a Snapdragon Elite X processor, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.\nThe X1 Fold is still more of a proof-of-concept product than a mass-market device, but it’s the best foldable laptop we’ve seen to date. It feels cramped in laptop mode when the display is folded into a small, 12-inch screen. It works better as an all-in-one with the 16.3-inch OLED display unfolded and propped up against the separate kickstand with the Bluetooth keyboard in front of it. The kickstand can hold the display in either landscape or portrait mode, and it works well in either orientation.\nThe ThinkPad X1 Fold 16 puts us one step closer to getting a foldable laptop that's more than just a curiosity for deep-pocketed early adopters. Its design is sleeker than that of [Asus’s thick and clunky Zenbook 17 Fold](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/asus-zenbook-fold-oled-review-the-coolest-folding-screen-laptop-youll-never-buy/). Its price is much more reasonable than [HP’s Spectre Foldable PC](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/hp-spectre-foldable-pc-review-its-slick-but-quirky/). Lenovo has dropped the price of the X1 to where it now starts at around $1,900. Our test system with the keyboard folio included rings in at just over $2,300.\nOther laptops we've tested\n[Acer Swift 16 AI](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/acer-swift-16-ai-review-the-perfect-midrange-entertainment-laptop-but-for-one-flaw/): It's thin.

This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\nWe test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, including [Primate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6](https://www.geekbench.com/), [Cinebench R23](https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads/cinebench-r23-downloads), [PCMark 10](https://benchmarks.ul.com/pcmark10), a variety of [3DMark](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/3DMark/) benchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1088850/Marvels_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy/), [The Rift Breaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/780310/The_Riftbreaker/) (CPU and GPU) and [Shadow of the Tomb Raider](https://store.steampowered.com/app/750920/Shadow_of_the_Tomb_Raider_Definitive_Edition/).\nFor the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our [How We Test Computers](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-we-test-computers/) page.\n[Show more]\nFactors to consider\nThere are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment, and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. To help simplify things for you, here are the main things you should consider when you start looking.\nPrice\nThe search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it, which holds whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop capability as you can afford from the start.\nGenerally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capability for less.\nOperating system\nChoosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. If you're not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you'll like MacOS too.\nWhen it comes to price and variety (and PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you're getting a MacBook. Apple's MacBooks regularly top our best lists, but the least expensive one is the M1 MacBook Air for $999. It is regularly discounted to $750 or $800, but if you want a cheaper MacBook, you'll have to consider older refurbished ones.\nWindows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we'd be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we'd give a full-throated recommendation to, but if you need a laptop for online shopping, email and word processing, they exist.\nIf you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows. Make sure the applications you need have a [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), Android or Linux app before making the leap. If you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or using cloud-gaming services, they're a good fit.\nSize\nRemember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Laptop size is primarily determined by screen size, which factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. Keep in mind other physics-related characteristics, such as an ultrathin laptop isn't necessarily lighter than a thick one, you can't expect a wide array of connections on a small or ultrathin model and so on.\nScreen\nWhen it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: how much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work.\nYou really want to optimize pixel density, which is the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen at [DPI Calculator](https://www.sven.de/dpi/) if you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) We recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb.\nBecause of the way Windows and MacOS scale for the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill, but may not be if you need to view a wide spreadsheet, for example.\nIf you need a laptop with relatively accurate color, that displays the most colors possible or that supports HDR, you can't simply trust the specs. This is because manufacturers usually fail to provide the necessary context to understand what the specs they quote mean. You can find a ton of detail about considerations for different types of screen uses in our monitor buying guides for [general-purpose monitors](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/monitors-buying-guide/), [creators](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-buy-a-laptop-to-edit-photos-videos-or-other-creative-tasks/), [gamers and HDR viewing](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-choose-an-hdr-gaming-monitor/).\nProcessor\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with its [Arm-based Snapdragon X processors](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-and-x-plus-laptop-chips-explained/). Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to [Intel's](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000028083/processors.html) or [AMD's](https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-processors-laptop) sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.\nApple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. Like Intel and AMD, you'll still want to pay attention to the naming conventions to know what kind of performance to expect. Apple uses its M-series chipsets in Macs. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip with an eight-core CPU and seven-core GPU. The current models have M2-series silicon that starts with an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU and goes up to the M2 Max with a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance.\nBattery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple's Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-based [Copilot Plus PCs](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/microsoft-qualcomm-take-another-shot-at-pcs-with-copilot-plus/) we've tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD.\nGraphics\nThe graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated or discrete. As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.\nBecause the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU.\nFor more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.\nMemory\nFor memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this, but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded.\nSome PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences, because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls.\nStorage\nYou'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives. If the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working.\nGet what you can afford, and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: We don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game.\n[Show more]\nLaptop FAQs\nHow much do good laptops cost?\nWhich is better: MacOS or Windows?\nAre Chromebooks worth it?\nWhat's the best laptop for home, travel or both?\nWhich laptop is best for gaming or creating?\nWhat to consider\nPrice\nOperating System\nSize\nScreen\nProcessor\nGraphics\nMemory\nStorage",

    "title": "The secret to choosing a snow-sure ski resort this winter",
    "text": "Nobody wants to go on a ski holiday without any snow. Not only is the white stuff a key aesthetic to the perfect winter wonderland, it’s imperative to actually being able to spend your days on the slopes skiing or snowboarding.\nLast winter, holiday spirits were dampened when mild temperatures and rain forced some low-lying resorts to temporarily shut down operations on the pistes. By contrast, this winter’s ski season in Europe has started with bumper snowfall in many resorts – however the risk of high temperatures can always be cause for concern. All is a reminder of the effects changing weather patterns are having on the future of ski holidays .\nTravellers’ behaviour reflects just how important good snow cover is to a happy holiday. According to research carried out by the Mountain Trade Network (MTN), resort altitude (and the associated guarantee of snow) is the third most important factor for Britons when booking a ski holiday (marginally behind ski area size, and price). It’s importance has skyrocketed in the past three years, according to historic MTN data.\nLuckily, it’s something the ski industry has been preparing for. British-run VIP Ski no longer offers packages to resorts lower than 1,500m – to ensure its customers will have ski-to-the-door conditions – while the likes of Crystal Ski Holidays, Inghams and Club Med now have policies that guarantee against poor snow cover and closed slopes. The latter, in its most recent customer survey, found 81 per cent of people would be more likely to book a holiday with an operator offering a snow guarantee. Under these terms and conditions customers are offered the chance to move their plans to an alternative (open) resort, to ensure they can ski, or to cancel and claim credit towards a later departure.\nNow, more than ever before, it pays to know how to choose a ski resort where snow is almost always guaranteed , whatever the season throws at us.\nFive tips for finding a snow-sure resort Aim high Heading high is one of the single most important factors for guaranteed snow conditions. Every 1,000m you ascend equates to an estimated drop in temperature of 9.8°C if clear and 6°C if cloudy; every metre higher means you are that much further above the freezing level – the point where rain (one of the worst words in a skiers’ lexicon) turns to snow (one of the most positive). Be warned, experts are warning, as ski resorts battle the impacts of climate change, that the freezing level will continue to rise in altitude.\nThe French resort of Val Thorens is the loftiest village in Europe (2,300m) with access to some of its highest slopes, up to 3,230m. It’s one of the best bankers for snow but any resort with slopes up to 3,000m is a good bet.\nVal Thorens is the highest resort in Europe, where snow is guaranteed almost all season Credit : JEFF PACHOUD/AFP Glacial good luck Glaciers go hand in hand with high-altitude resorts. These gigantic blocks of ice, which can be over 100m deep, are excellent at preserving snow once fallen, and when mostly scraped off are still useful for perfecting skiing-on-ice skills.\nThe highest glacier skiing in Europe, the Plateau Rosa at 3,500m, accessed from Zermatt in Switzerland and Cervinia in Italy, offers 21km of prepared pistes. Other notable resorts with glaciers include Solden and Hintertux in Austria, Saas-Fee in Switzerland, and Tignes and Les Deux Alpes in France. The super-keen can be found honing their skills on training courses hosted on the most snow-sure glaciers during the summer and autumn months, if snow levels allow, and their snow-sure qualities make them enduringly popular in winter too.\nNorth face, happy face We all know the benefits of a south-facing garden as it gets more sunshine and the same principle holds true for a ski resort’s pistes. Lovely though it is to bask on sun-drenched slopes, it’s not good for snow quality – unless it’s toe-curlingly cold and then it really doesn’t matter. Since north-facing slopes aren’t affected by the sun, conditions remain much more consistent and the snow remains in better nick for longer, especially late in the season. The problem is, most piste maps rarely reveal the orientation of the slopes – you need a proper chart to assess accurately.\nLocation, location, location Some destination have lucked out with benign weather systems. Japanese resorts, especially those on the north island of Hokkaido, are a good example. They are not high, don’t have glaciers and are not overly endowed with north-facing slopes. What they do have is geographical good fortune.\nJapan is blessed by incredible natural snow fall Wind blows from Siberia, hits the Sea of Japan then dumps up to 15m a year of the lightest, fluffiest snow known to humankind. The Utah resorts of Alta and Snowbird have a similar annual snowfall, thanks to a similar effect. Most of Utah’s storm systems come from the Pacific ocean but local geography has an impact too. The Great Salt Lake, north west of the city, warms the approaching air and aids moisture. The warm air rises, cools and starts to drop its snow - a phenomenon known as Lake-effect snow. Resorts in North America could be among those that benefit from the El Niño winter – with predictions of record-breaking snow levels.\nFaking it Snow-making has come on in leaps and bounds over the last 20 years and many resorts have invested millions in the latest technology, which is both reliable and sustainable. Resorts in the Italian Dolomites are a great example where almost all of its 1,200km of pistes are covered by snow cannons, if the real stuff comes up short. So long as it’s cold enough, there will be snow.\nRelated Topics Alpine Skiing, Snow, France, Italy, French Alps, Switzerland",

Siempre al pie del cañón, en su silla de ruedas los últimos años, con una mantita y gorro si es que hacía falta. Pero para Rosita ir al SkyFi Castalia a ver jugar al conjunto albinegro lo era todo por eso, al anunciar su pérdida a los 92 años, desde el club de la capital de la Plana se le ha querido honrar con una publicación en redes sociales.\nA Rosita, además de sus familiares y amigos, al conocían todos los que se sientan cerca de ella en el feudo albinegro, pero su nombre se conoció públicamenta hacer un par de años cuando la plantilla del Castellón quiso rendirle homenaje cuando iba a cumplir 91 años, bajándola al verde de Castalia y fotografiándose con ella.\nEn enero del año pasado, de nuevo el Castellón la nombró en sus redes sociales por el esfuerzo tan grande que hacía para acompañar a su equipo y alentarle partido a partido. Rosita pudo disfrutar\ncon el ascenso a Segunda División. Nos ha dejado Rosita, una vida en albinegre. Descanse en paz. RRSS WhatsApp RRSS Facebook RRSS Twitter RRSS email Copiar URL)",
