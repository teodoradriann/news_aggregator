    "text": "New Delhi, Feb 29 Indian Naval Sailing Vessel Tarini has embarked on a historic expedition, from INS Mandovi (Goa) to Port Louis (Mauritius), in the first-ever trans-oceanic sortie undertaken by Indian women in a double-handed mode, the Navy said on Thursday.\nLt Commanders Dilna K. and Roopa A. are participating in this expedition, conducted under the aegis of Indian Naval Sailing Association, showcasing &apos;Nari Shakti&apos; (woman power) in the maritime domain. The venture not only highlights the exceptional skill and dedication of the Navy&apos;s women personnel but also underscores the nation&apos;s commitment to promote gender equality and inclusivity in traditionally male-dominated fields, it said.\nTheir endeavour also serves as a crucial part of their preparation for the upcoming circumnavigation of the globe, scheduled later this year, a Navy official said. The two officers have been preparing themselves for the last two and a half years, following a rigorous selection process. Prior to the present expedition, the two, as part of a crew of six, sailed from Goa to Mauritius and back in 2022, followed by an expedition from Goa to Rio De Janeiro via Cape Town and back last year.\nThereafter, the officers undertook a sailing expedition from Goa to Port Blair and back in a double-handed mode.\nThis would be their last consolidation expedition prior to the circumnavigation planned to commence in September this year, the official added.\nThe expedition was flagged off by distinguished yachtsman, Commander Abhilash Tomy (retd), who has circumnavigated the globe non-stop on sailing boats twice. He has been mentoring the two women officers for last six months.\nTomy said that this expedition symbolises the spirit of adventure and resilience that defines the Indian Navy and exuded full confidence in the capabilities of the two women officers, while wishing them fair winds and smooth seas on their historic voyage.\nThe Navy said that transoceanic expedition of INSV Tarini signifies a significant step forward in India&apos;s maritime endeavours, showcasing the nation&apos;s growing prominence in global maritime activities and gender equality on the high seas. It is a testament to the Indian Navy&apos;s commitment to fostering excellence and diversity within its ranks, it added.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

    "text": "\\n \\n Victor Wembanyama ‘s NBA Season Cut Short by Deep Vein Thrombosis \\n \\n\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\n\\n \\nThe NBA season for Victor Wembanyama, the 21-year-old, 7-foot-4 French basketball sensation, has come to an abrupt end before the playoffs. The San Antonio Spurs announced that Wembanyama has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his left shoulder, according to a statement by the NBA team, which ESPN.com reported. This diagnosis means that Wembanyama will not be able to play for the rest of the season, much to the disappointment of his fans and the Spurs’ hopes for the postseason.\n\\n \\n \\n Understanding Thrombosis and Its Impact \\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the legs or arms. In Wembanyama’s case, the clot developed in his left shoulder. The player is said to have noticed symptoms upon returning to San Antonio from the annual All-Star Gala in San Francisco. Standard treatment for DVT involves blood thinners. However, engaging in contact sports, particularly in an intense game like basketball, could increase the risk of complications.\n\\n Thrombosis is typically cured with a blood thinner, but in this case, you cannot participate in contact sports, and there is very physical contact in basketball.\n\\n \\n \\n future Prospects and Impact on the Spurs \\nThe Spurs have expressed confidence that Wembanyama will be fully recovered and ready to return for the 2025-2026 season. This season is Wembanyama’s second in the NBA, and despite his rookie status, he has made a significant impact. He currently leads the league in blocked shots with 3.8 per game and ranks high in points, rebounds, and assists.\n\\n \\n \\n The Team’s Outlook and Implications \\nThe diagnosis comes at a crucial time for the Spurs, especially given the team’s placement at 23/29, effectively eliminating most of their chances of making the playoffs. Although this does not directly impact Wembanyama’s status, it raises concerns about the team’s postseason eligibility and future games without him.\n\\nSome point to this a pivotal moment in Wembanyama’s young career, reminiscent of when LeBron James took the stage. Just like the basketball legend King James\\u2019s Impact on his first two years, where his absence would impact the team dynamics drastically. However, it also can be considered hope for the young future of the sport, showcasing how different medical issues could shape a profession of athlete.\n\\n \\n",

    "text": "2024 Toyota GR 86 Gets Attractive Pricing, Trueno Variant [Julien Amado](/en/authors/julien-amado/) The Toyota GR86 is one of the rare affordable sports cars left on the face of the Earth. Its 2.4-liter flat-four engine isn't the most powerful on the market with 228 hp, but the performance it delivers is more than sufficient considering the weight and chassis of the GR 86. While the specifications of the 2024 model have already been published, Toyota Canada has finally released pricing details. The base GR 86 with a manual gearbox is priced at $32,350 (MSRP), which is quite good for what you get. Of course, the GR 86’s interior isn't the most technologically advanced on the market, but the equipment it contains is generous. The base model includes 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and daytime running lights, heated mirrors, push-button keyless ignition, a 7-inch screen and a 6-speaker audio system. - Also: [Toyota Spices Up GR Corolla, GR 86 and GR Supra for 2024](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/71012/toyota-spices-up-gr-corolla-gr-86-and-gr-supra-for-2024/) - Also: [Most and Least Liked Vehicles in 2023 According to Consumer Reports](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/69425/most-and-least-liked-vehicles-in-2023-according-to-consumer-reports/) The same model with automatic transmission costs $2,000 more. For this price, buyers also receive a suite of advanced safety systems including collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning system and a preceding vehicle start-up alert. For added efficiency and sportiness, the manual and automatic Premium versions (priced at $35,350 and $37,350, respectively) add 18-inch wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, a specific rear spoiler, an adaptive lighting system, aluminum pedals, heated front seats (covered in leather/alcantara), automatic high beams and a blind spot detection system. TRUENO Special Edition Toyota has added the GR 86 TRUENO Edition at the top of the range for 2024, with an MSRP of $39,150. Available only with a manual gearbox, this special version is based on the Premium model, but adds Brembo brakes and Sachs shock dampers. In addition to these technical upgrades, the car also receives some unique elements, including select body components painted in black (spoiler, mirrors, door handles, hood), specific 18-inch wheels, and an exclusive black and red interior. The base and Premium models are available right away. The TRUENO’s production has been capped at just 50 units for all of Canada. [Share on Facebook]",

    "text": "No departamento médico!\nCom apenas três minutos em 2025 pelo Botafogo, Bastos continua o seu calvário de lesões. O internacional angolano sofreu um trauma no joelho e encontra-se entregue ao departamento médico do clube brasileiro.\nDe acordo com o jornalista Bernardo Gentile, o defesa-central terá um tempo de paragem de seis semanas. Por esse motivo, ele deverá regressar ao Alvinegro apenas na estreia do Campeonato Brasileiro no dia 30 de março. Na oportunidade, o Botafogo defronta o Palmeiras, de Abel Ferreira.\nRecentemente, houve a informação de que o clube do Rio de Janeiro adotou um tratamento conservador, com fisioterapia e medicamentos, para a evolução progressiva de Bastos. Recorda-se que ele reapresentou-se mais tarde do que o restante do plantel, a 20 de janeiro.\nSequência de lesões de Bastos no Botafogo\nTitular da campanha vitoriosa do Botafogo em 2024, Bastos sofreu um problema muscular na coxa esquerda ante o Palmeiras em 26 de novembro do ano passado. Por conta disso, ele falhou a final da Taça Libertadores e da estreia na Taça Intercontinental.\nO internacional angolano estreou em 2025 apenas na 8.ª jornada do Campeonato Carioca numa partida contra o Nova Iguaçu, no passado dia 6. No entanto, ele deixou o relvado precocemente após sofrer uma pancada no joelho esquerdo no início do jogo.\nBastos continua no departamento médico. Foto: Getty Images.\nAusência na Recopa Sul-Americana\nSem Bastos, o Botafogo terá dois compromissos importantes na Recopa Sul-Americana contra o Racing, da Argentina. A prova reúne os campeões da Taça Libertadores e da Taça Sul-Americana. O primeiro jogo será nesta quinta-feira (20), enquanto a segunda mão vai acontecer no dia 27.\nVeja também\nZico, lenda do Flamengo, desfaz-se em elogios a Cristiano Ronaldo e afirma: “Um dos maiores…”\nAlém disso, o Alvinegro, que continua sem um treinador após a recusa de Vasco Matos, decidirá o seu futuro no Campeonato Carioca no dérbi com o Vasco da Gama no domingo (23).",

    "text": "A lot has been uncovered on the so-called 'Frankenstein' rabbits that were discovered in Colorado recently.\nThe horrifying sight has caught the eyes of those on social media for all the wrong reasons, with their 'face tentacles' stealing headlines in particular.\nSince being photographed in the US and shared online, panic spread like wildfire, with many pet owners and locals worrying about the severity of the condition and how it would affect them.\nIn all fairness, it might be one of the most disturbing animal-related sights you'll ever lay your eyes on.\nAdvert\nPeople on Reddit claimed that they'd 'freak out' if they saw these herbivores, and even compared the sight to something you would see in a 'nightmare'.\nIt has since been revealed that these rabbits are suffering from a particular virus called Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus (CRPV), but what is it, and can we contract it?\nWhat causes CRPV?\nCottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus was discovered on cottontail rabbits in the American Midwest in 1933, and it also came to be known as Shope papilloma virus.\nAdvert\nThey can be found on the skin of rabbits, as papilloma virus can lead to squamous cell carcinomas developing, which is also known as cancer.\nAccording to Pet MD, the 'raised, red, and rough' lesions can sprout from their ears, eyelids, neck, shoulders, abdomen, thighs, or even the feet, though they develop into black tumours.\nIt is understood by scientists that the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and other biting insects, though it can also be passed between rabbits.\nThe virus can also be passed via bedding, as well as food and water bowls. CRPV can be passed through blood transfusion too - though this is far less likely.\nHow dangerous is CRPV?\nWhen it comes to pet rabbits, cases are rare, but they aren't impossible.\nAdvert\nAny rabbit can pass it to any other rabbit, wild or domestic, and those pesky creepy-crawlies can't be stopped when they want to be a nuisance, unfortunately.\nThe summertime is also the season for them to thrive, so it's worth monitoring your bouncy friends, if you have one.\nLuckily though, wild cottontail rabbits, the species most affected, are found in the US midwest.\nWith that being said, brush rabbits, black-tailed jackrabbits, snowshoe hares, European rabbits, and domestic rabbits could be affected too, though chances are lower.\nVetlexicon states that the virus simply 'does not occur in the UK or Europe', but better to be safe than sorry and all that.\nAdvert\nCan it spread to humans?\nIt's the million pound question, and luckily, CRPV is a non-zootonic disease.\nThis means that it won't pass between animals and humans, though this doesn't mean you should go around touching these lesions.\nIn case we all forgot, non-zootonic diseases can mutate - just cast your mind back a few years to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdvert\nWLBT3 report that it's important to steer clear of rabbits with these black tentacles coming out of their bodies, as nobody really wants anything like that sticking out of their own bodies.\nColorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) have echoed this same sentiment, regardless of how curious you may be.",

    "text": "Antes de su presentación, la artista que imita a la mexicana Ana Bárbara sufrió un episodio de ansiedad que la hizo romper en llanto.\nAntes de presentarse en el Templo de la Imitación, la doble de Ana Bárbara tuvo anoche una crisis nerviosa y no pudo dejar de llorar, por lo que sus compañeros intentan calmarla y darle ánimo. Además: Selena Gomez borró su video llorando por deportación de mexicanos; le ‘llovieron’ críticas\nEl imitador de ‘Luis Alfonso’ también la reconfortó: “En este momento tienes nervios, pero tienes que darlo todo en el escenario. Tú cantas muy bonito, respira”.\nSin embargo, la reacción de la jurado Amparo Grisales fue diferente. La reconocida jurado expresó su desconcierto ante la situación: “En este tipo de casos, hay que respirar y conectar con lo que sabes hacer, con lo que estás comprometido (...) No entiendo a esta chica, si no ha entrado a escena o no se siente segura, no ensayó”.\nA pesar del episodio de ansiedad, la imitadora de Ana Bárbara logró interpretar ‘Loca’ en el escenario. Su actuación, que incluyó baile y un gran despliegue escénico, recibió buenos comentarios por parte de Rey Ruiz.\nAmparo Grisales dijo que le falta preparación a la imitadora de Ana Bárbara\n“Respira, pero respira de verdad”, le aconsejó Amparo Grisales durante la devolución de los jurados. Por su parte, la concursante reconoció la dificultad del momento: “Para mí, esta canción es un reto. Es una canción muy movida y me bloqueó todo”. Otras noticias: Amparo Grisales explotó contra César Escola en ‘Yo Me Llamo’: “Vete al diablo”\nNo obstante, Amparo Grisales insistió en la importancia de la preparación: “Pero entonces tienes que ensayar bien, haz ejercicio mientras cantas, tienes que darla toda (...) Te falta mucho”.\nEl otro jurado, el saldero Rey Ruiz, en cambio, le brindó un comentario más positivo: “Me gustó”.\nAl finalizar su presentación, la imitadora salió llorando y expresó su frustración. “Me faltó la respiración, es una canción difícil y yo sé que no salió del todo bien, pero salí con el mejor ánimo y la disposición de hacerlo todo bien”. admitió.\n— Yo Me Llamo (@YomeLlamo)\n[#YoMeLlamo]Ana Bárbara se bloquea y tiene un ataque de pánico antes de salir al escenario[https://t.co/2rmeE5GRMT][January 31, 2025]",
