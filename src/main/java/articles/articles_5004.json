    "text": "The [2024 Golden Globes ](https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/509284/golden-globe-nominees-2024-full-list/)look set to be just as star-studded as we hoped, and it looks like Hollywood BFFs [ Matt Damon](https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/matt-damon/) and [Ben Affleck](https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/ben-affleck/) will reunite on stage. The final presenters list has been revealed, and the two multi-hyphenates have been named, although it's unclear which category they will present. Ben and Matt both starred in the Globes-nominated Air; Ben has three Golden Globes while Matt has two. [9-1-1 ](https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/9-1-1/)star Angela Bassett will also be on the stage throughout the event, as will [previously announced Suits stars Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht](https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/510504/meghan-markle-suits-co-stars-patrick-j-adams-gabriel-macht-golden-globes-reunion/). Hailee Steinfeld, of Spiderman: Across the Universe fame, will also be presenting, while Kate Beckinsale is sure to wow us all as she graces the stage. Other A-listers set to present include The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes star Hunter Schafer, Barbie actress and pop star Dua Lipa, Yellowstone's Kevin Costner and Oprah Winfrey herself. These presenters will not only get to appear on stage in front of millions of TV viewers but they will also be among [ the 83 recipients of this year's $500,000 gift bag, curated by the Robb Report. ](https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/510654/inside-the-5 -golden-globes-gift-bag-taylor-swift-margot-robbie-and-emma-stone-may-receive-exclusive/) There are more than 35 products and experiences available to winners and presenters at the annual awards show, including an exotic yacht charter worth $50,000, six bottles of Liber Pater the World's Most Expensive Wine at $193,500 per bottle, $1,500 Opie Way custom-made sneakers, a session with a celebrity tattoo artist, $500 bottles of tequila and so much more. Paul Croughton, Editor-in-Chief of Robb Report, which brands itself as the leading voice in global luxury told HELLO! that curating the 2024 bag was never about looking at a price tag, but \"to explore, identify and curate the Best of the Best in all aspects of luxury\". The gift bag itself is a beautiful $600 brown suede bag by Métier – a luxury leather goods house dedicated to creating timeless pieces of the highest quality, handcrafted in Italy – and inside is a beautiful hardback book: \"We want to give recipients the opportunity to dive into the book to browse all the amazing opportunities and products presented and select from the best of the best.\" As for who may take home the statues this year, it's not exactly surprising that Barbie and Oppenheimer are the leaders of the pack this year after their box office success and the cultural impact they had on the public. Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, will be hoping to win big in the major categories to help its Oscars chances, while its box office rival, Oppenheimer, comes in a close second on the nominations count; the two movies will go up against each other for Best Screenplay, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture, and Cinematic and Box Office Achievement in Motion Pictures.",

    "text": "Neighbors came to an elderly Hollywood couple’s aid after a lightning strike brought down a power line and set their house on fire.\nSpeaking with 7News on Thursday, Ester and Juan Castro saids they can’t believe the unimaginable happened during Wednesday’s storm. Now they’re trying to get back on their feet after their home was damaged in the fire.\n“I thank God that I’m alive, that my husband is alive,” said Ester.\nThe couple and their dog Luna have called their Hollywood house their home for 22 years. But in a flash, they almost lost everything.\n“All of a sudden, all I hear is my husband, because I heard the explosions, like three, so I’m already starting to get up to find out what’s going on,” said Ester.\nEster told 7News that lightning struck a utility pole near their home.\n“I just hear my husband screaming, ‘My house is on fire! Our house is on fire! Baby, my house is on fire,'” she said.\nAccording to Hollywood Police, a power line came crashing down in their backyard, igniting a transformer and scorching the side of their home.\nBut thanks to some good neighbors, Ester and Juan were able to get out safely.\nRaymond Figueroa is one of the good Samaritans who helped the Castros.\n“We saw that strike. After that, we heard the explosion. It was so loud, you felt it in the ground,” he said. “That’s when I got the fire extinguisher and ran across the street.”\nFigueroa knew his elderly neighbors needed help getting out of their house, which was filling up with smoke and flames.\nNext door, Christian Rojas jumped up to call Juan and 911.\n“His wife couldn’t get to outside quick enough. She’s in a walker, she just had surgery,” said Rojas.\nFigueroa got the couple out of the smoke-filled home and into Rojas’ house.\n“My rescue firefighter, I’m calling him now,” said Ester.\nBut now she’s just hoping to make this house a home again and celebrate the life for which they’re so grateful.\n“I give thanks to God that I didn’t fall, ’cause I would have been in the hospital bed right now. But I thank the Lord,” said Ester.\nThe fire damaged the ceiling, attic and the side of their home. Unfortunately, many of their possessions were damaged as well.\nEster said she is working with her home insurance company on the damages to her home, adding the property will need all new electrical and home repairs done.\nEster and Juan said they are blessed to have friends and family who have stepped up and offered them places to stay.\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe page to cover the costs of the damage as they wait for their home insurance to assist them.

    "text": "'I think we stop here': Jannik Sinner sends Open crowd into hysterics with cheeky John McEnroe sledge\nItalian superstar Jannik Sinner drew raucous laughs from the Rod Laver Arena crowd with a cheeky sledge of tennis great John McEnroe on Thursday night.\nThe world No.1 had just knocked out Aussie Tristan Schoolkate in four sets after the local hope stunned him by taking the first set.\nUnlike American upstart Danielle Collins - who sledged the crowd about how much money she makes on tour after beating Australian player Destanee Aiava - Sinner showed class in thanking the fans who packed Melbourne's iconic stadium.\nREAD MORE: Tomic games probed in match fixing investigation\nREAD MORE: Teen stuns Medvedev in five-hour epic\nREAD MORE: American veteran gets entire crowd offside with sledge\nThe 23-year-old had looked flustered early in the match when Schoolkate got on top of him with a superb serve-and-volley tactic.\nBut Sinner is typically cool as a cucumber and remained relatively calm - a fact noted by McEnroe during their on-court interview following the match.\n\"I'm pretty emotional,\" McEnroe said.\n\"Generally , when I've been in Italy, Italians express themselves. You are able to control yourself so well.\nWatch the Australian Open live & free on the 9Network & 9Now. Stan Sport is the only place to watch every match ad-free, live & on demand with centre court in 4K.\n\"I want to know how you do it.\"\nAmerican great McEnroe was famously flamboyant on the court and prone to outbursts, as many top tennis players are.\nHis question to Sinner was met with a wry smile.\n\"We can say we are a bit different, me and you,\" Sinner joked as the crowd broke into laughter.\n\"But it shows that everyone is different, everyone has their own mentality.\n\"I have mine, I have to say I'm quite happy with my one.\"\nThe crowd erupted again as McEnroe responded, \"what are you saying?\", to which a red-faced Sinner said, \"I think we stop (the interview) here\".\nSinner faces Marcos Giron in round three.",

Hydrate yourself!”, Rio’s municipal alert system warned on west, after 60.1°C the day before, a record since this type of measurement began in 2014.\nThe western area of Rio is made up of poor, outlying and poorly served neighborhoods, where more than 40% of the population of this city of more than six million inhabitants lives.\nWith a maximum real temperature of 42°C on Sunday, the felt temperature rose to the highest even in the residential area of the Botanical Garden in the south of Rio, privileged with its numerous vegetation and where the felt temperature rose to 57.7° C Sunday.\n“I am very afraid that it will get worse, because the population is increasing a lot and deforestation is very significant due to the increase in the number of housing units,” she added.\nEmblematic of Rio, the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana were packed with people on Sunday. Many have also found refuge in Tijuca Park, a real green lung in the city.\nIn Sao Paulo, the largest city in South America with double the population of Rio, more than 12 million, Saturday was the hottest day of the year with the mercury rising to 34.7° vs.\nThis is the highest temperature for a month of March since the Brazilian National Meteorological Institute (Inmet) began measuring it in 1943.\nSunday brought barely perceptible relief: the thermometer fell back to 34.3 oC, at the level of the previous record for a month of March recorded in 2012.\nHere again, the parks of Brazil’s most populous metropolis were full. Many also set out to attack the coast, causing huge traffic jams at the city gates, to the point of forming a line of 20 kilometers of cars, according to local media.\nFloods in the south\nIn the south of Brazil, on the contrary, it is rain that threatens. Extreme rainfall is expected to continue this week, authorities warned.\n“The week will be at high risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms in south-central Brazil,” weather information agency MetSul warned on Sunday. “The most concerning system is a very intense cold front that will arrive with torrential rain and possible gales,” she added.\nSome localities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul are recording “exceptionally high” volumes of precipitation. In Uruguaiana, the most affected city in the state, broadcast images of flooded streets and buses half in water.\nUp to 500 millimeters of water could fall, according to MetSul, while in February the state of Rio Grande do Sul was suffocating with heat due to an “extreme heat dome” from Argentina.\nExperts attribute these extreme phenomena and meteorological instability to climate change and the El Niño phenomenon which affects the southern cone of Latin America, in the middle of summer, causing forest fires in Chile.\nThe current climate has already warmed by around 1.2°C compared to 1850-1900, causing an increase in episodes of drought, floods and heat waves.\n1711073671\n#rise #ocean #levels #experienced #jump\nRelated posts:\nBrazilian experts tell their experiences and impressions about the Samsung Galaxy S23 5G line Elden Ring players have found a PvP build that is almost unstoppable Pantera Wireless Headset, the perfect headset for Gamers News | Four astronauts back on Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule Hipgnosis, pioneer of music catalogs, sees its management challenged by its shareholders the mystery of the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae in the 19th century The Deflationary Effect: Uncovering the Changes in Ethereum's Economic Model Post-Merge Windows 11: new build adds Copilot, SMB client encryption and more in the Canary channel",

L’appuntamento è fissato per domani, dalle 8 alle 10, nell’ambito delle 8 ore di sciopero proclamate dalle organizzazioni sindacali, davanti ai cancelli della fabbrica, che fa parte del gruppo attivo nei settori della difesa, dell’aerospazio e della sicurezza e ha una divisione elettronica nel polo industriale di via della Lama, a sud dell’abitato montevarchino.\nSi tratta di una tappa ulteriore della mobilitazione indetta a livello nazionale da Fim Cisl , Fiom Cgil e Uilm Uil che hanno deciso di intensificare le iniziative di lotta a cominciare dal blocco degli straordinari e delle flessibilità. \"Ancora una volta – sottolineano i rappresentanti provinciali delle tute blu della Triplice - siamo costretti a mobilitarci nel tentativo di riaprire il tavolo di trattativa per il rinnovo del contratto nazionale di categoria sulla base della piattaforma unitaria che è stata votata da oltre il 90 per cento delle lavoratrici e dei lavoratori\".\nUn dialogo che si è interrotto bruscamente, spiegano i sindacati, \"a causa delle posizioni fortemente contrarie assunte da Federmeccanica ed Assistal che di fatto ne stanno impedendo la ripresa\". Si nega così il diritto fondamentale delle maestranze a raggiungere la nuova intesa e le tre segreterie aretine ribadiscono che proprio in questa fase è necessario dare continuità al cammino intrapreso in precedenza per ottenere quanto dovuto e supportare la vertenza con azioni concrete e visibili all’intera opinione pubblica.\n\"E’ il momento della partecipazione, di mobilitarsi, di scioperare compatti, uniti, tutti insieme – aggiungono - per superare l’intransigenza di Federmeccanica ed Assistal a riaprire la trattativa\". Il traguardo imprescindibile è arrivare alla sigla del nuovo contratto con aumenti salariali \"certi ed esigibili sui minimi contrattuali, oltre l’inflazione, a tutela del potere d’acquisto dei salari, per contrastare la precarietà, ridurre gli orari ed estendere i diritti, per aumentare la salute e sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro e negli appalti\".\nNel sito valdarnese, composto da due fabbricati, Leonardo Spa è approdata nel 2017 sulla base del piano di fusione per incorporazione della ex Sirio Panel che allora occupava circa 300 dipendenti, con una preponderanza di giovani laureati e un’età media attorno ai 35 anni.",

    "title": "Government of Canada Passes Legislation to Seize the Enormous Economic Opportunity Offshore Wind Presents for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador",
    "text": "OTTAWA, ON , Oct. 3, 2024 /CNW/ - The offshore renewable energy sector presents a generational economic opportunity for Canada , with the global offshore wind market alone forecast to attract one trillion dollars in investment by 2040. Canada , in partnership with Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador , is working to seize this unprecedented economic opportunity and create jobs for Atlantic Canadians.\nToday, Bill C-49: An Act to amend the Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act and the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act , received Royal Assent. Developed in partnership with the Government of Nova Scotia and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador , this legislation will help unlock the enormous potential of offshore renewable energy, to generate thousands of jobs while attracting billions in investment and creating new economic opportunities in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador .\nBy harnessing the world-class wind resources in the Atlantic offshore, we are positioning Canada as the leading supplier of clean energy, including the clean hydrogen countries like Germany are looking to buy, while continuing to decarbonize our electricity grids here at home. This legislation advances the priorities identified through the Regional Energy and Resource Tables in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador , including seizing the opportunity clean energy presents.\nThe Government of Canada is working with the Governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador to develop offshore renewable energy resources, enabling the provinces to capitalize on their existing strengths and accelerate offshore wind development safely and responsibly. Nova Scotia has already adopted mirror legislation, with Newfoundland and Labrador expected to do the same in the coming weeks.\nCanadian workers and businesses are well positioned to seize the enormous economic opportunity clean energy presents, in Atlantic Canada and beyond. Today's legislation underscores Canada's commitment to deliver prosperity, create new clean energy opportunities, strengthen the economy, create thousands of jobs and better protect Canada's environment.\nQuotes\n\"Bill C-49 enables Atlantic Canada to seize the generational economic opportunity presented by offshore renewable energy. It will strengthen the economy, enable the creation of thousands of jobs and attract billions in investments in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador . These opportunities would not have been possible without the close collaboration of the Premiers of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia , Andrew Furey and Tim Houston , and Atlantic Canada's Members of Parliament, who fought and delivered for the people of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador .\"\nThe Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson Minister of Energy and Natural Resources\n\"Bill C-49 is important to Nova Scotia meeting its offshore wind targets. Investors are lining up to harness our wind power and produce clean energy for green hydrogen and other uses. Now that this bill has passed, along with our own provincial mirror legislation, we are well on our way to developing our offshore wind industry hand in hand with our federal partners, starting with issuing our first call for bids next year.\"\nThe Honourable Tory Rushton Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables, Government of Nova Scotia\n\"Bill C-49 ensures the necessary measures are in place to support offshore renewable energy opportunities; allows for a fiscal regime that provides the maximum economic returns to Newfoundland and Labrador ; and furthers joint management of the offshore area while building upon the extensive expertise the C-NLOPB has in managing offshore projects.\"\nThe Honourable Andrew Parsons, KC Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador\n\"I was honoured to sponsor a bill of such significant economic and environmental importance to my province. I look forward to seeing the positive impacts of Bill C-49, as this historic bill presents a generational opportunity for Newfoundland and Labrador , Nova Scotia and Canada as a whole.\"\nThe Honourable Iris G. Petten, Senator for Newfoundland and Labrador , Senate of Canada\nQuick Facts\nThis legislation establishes a joint management regulatory framework for offshore renewable energy development Bill-49 includes amendments to the Accord Acts that: establish the framework to develop offshore renewable energy; change the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board's name to the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator (CNSOER); change the Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board's name to the Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Energy Regulator (C-NLOER); expand the mandates of the CNSOER and the C-NLOER to include the regulation of offshore renewable energy projects; improve alignment between the Accord Acts and the Impact Assessment Act (IAA); provide tools to support the Government of Canada's marine conservation agenda; and modernize the land tenure regime for offshore petroleum development.
