    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Fighting between the army and paramilitary forces in Sudan’s capital Khartoum continues for the third day, where the death toll has risen to nearly 100.\nAccording to the report of the foreign news agency AFP, the fight that started on Saturday is between the army chief Abdul Fateh al-Barhan and his deputy, the commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohammad Hamdan Deglu.\nConcern was expressed at the global level regarding the worst fighting going on in Khartoum and there was a demand for negotiations by giving up the fighting immediately.\nThe doctors’ union said in a statement that 97 people, including civilians, have been killed so far in the clashes, but this number is not final because many people could not be taken to the hospital due to bad conditions.\nHe said that hundreds of civilians have been injured in the fighting so far.\nAccording to AFP correspondents, on Monday, terrifying sounds of gunfire and explosions are being heard across Khartoum, where clashes continue.\nAn eyewitness said that smoke and the smell of gunpowder spread from the damaged building.\nAccording to reports, the fighting between the two forces in the capital, Khartoum, began when Burhan and Deglu clashed over plans to integrate the RSF into the army.\nThis was the main condition of the final agreement after the two commanders set up a military government in 2021.\nThe seizure of the government by the military commanders in Sudan in 2019 ended the civil supremacy movement by ousting the then president Omar al-Bashir and created an economic crisis in the country.\nClashes have gripped civilians in Sudan, where the crisis has dragged on as hopes for civilian supremacy in the country have faded.\nOn Saturday, both sides accused each other of starting the fight.\nBoth sides claimed to have captured key sites, including the capital’s airport and the presidential palace, but their claims could not be independently confirmed.\nThe clashes later spread to other areas, including Sudan’s West Darfur region and the eastern border of Kassala state.\nThree World Food Program staff were killed in North Darfur on Saturday, prompting the agency to close its mission across Sudan.\nCalled for medical personnel to make way for ambulances and stop fighting to treat the injured as there are risks involved in taking the injured to the hospital.\nRecall that former President Omar al-Bashir formed the RSF in 2013, which emerged from the Janjaweed militia that his government used to control a non-Arab tribe in Darfur.\nThe current tension in Sudan is a result of the ongoing tussle between the two generals, which is indicative of the differences between the regular army and the RSF.\n#Clashes #army #paramilitary #forces #Khartoum #capital #Sudan #killed #people\n2024-08-22 21:29:10",
