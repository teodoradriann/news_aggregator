    "title": "Physiotherapist Fatima Siddiqui vs. Mowbray Physiotherapy Appeal | The Examiner | Launceston, TAS",
    "text": "A young physiotherapist who claimed she was terminated after raising concerns about not being paid award wages and overtime has taken the fight with her employer to an appeal in the Federal Court. Fatima Siddiqui was terminated from her position as a physiotherapist at Mowbray Physiotherapy in September 2021, and she subsequently filed a suit with the Federal Circuit and Family Court. She sought redress for unpaid wages, claiming that her employer, Muhammad Irfan, made her work more than ordinary full-time hours and failed to pay her overtime, and that she was paid at a rate lower than what she was entitled to. She also alleged that Mr Irfan terminated her employment after she raised these issues with him, and that her performance had been rated as 'satisfactory' in reports he sent on her to the health regulator. In the court hearings that followed in early 2023, Mr Irfan claimed that he had become dissatisfied with Ms Siddiqui's performance well before she raised the overtime issues. He claimed that he had decided to dismiss Ms Siddiqui because of concerns over the accuracy of her timesheets and her delay in giving a third-party consultant permission to conduct a police background check. This resulted in a delay in Ms Siddiqui being certified for work under the National Disability Insurance Scheme, resulting in a loss of potential business, he told the court. Federal Court Judge Sandra Taglieri found that Mr Irfan had breached rules surrounding overtime, and later ordered him to pay Ms Siddiqui $6376.30 in penalties and compensation for unpaid overtime work. But the judge found no fault with Mr Irfan's dismissal of Ms Siddiqui. \"I find that [Ms Siddiqui] was well aware that [Mr Irfan] was intending to terminate her employment for reasons relating to accuracy of timesheets, her impact on the business, and her aggression in challenging his integrity and failing to follow directions,\" the judge wrote in her decision. \"I do not accept that he was intending to terminate the employment because she was raising her right to be paid overtime.\" Judge Taglieri found that Ms Siddiqui's evidence was in some cases inconsistent and not supported by documentary evidence, and dismissed most of the former employee's other claims. Ms Siddiqui has now appealed those decisions in the Federal Court, with both parties now representing themselves. In preliminary proceedings for that appeal, Mr Irfan sought leave to cross-appeal, and suggested that Ms Siddiqui's case was based on 'inaccurately fabricated evidence', and 'retroactively produced records that fail to meet the requisite standard of proof.' He claimed that Ms Siddiqui was exhibiting \"vexatious conduct\" in her appeal, and opting to prolong the case to the detriment of the Australian legal system and taxpayers. In a preliminary decision last week, Justice Shaun McElwaine ruled to disallow the cross-appeal by Mr Irfan, but allowed Ms Siddiqui's appeal to proceed. The case is scheduled to be heard later this year. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date. We care about the protection of your data. Read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).",

    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).
