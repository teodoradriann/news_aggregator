    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services Since 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enet’s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms. Enet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Holding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations. Enet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.

    "text": "By Mary Gilbert and Dalia Faheid, CNN\n(CNN) — Violent storms were tracking through parts of the South Thursday, a day after deadly, destructive thunderstorms and tornadoes tore through the central and southern US, marking more chaotic weather amid a two-week streak of danger.\nLarge hail – some the size of golf and tennis balls – pounded parts of the South Thursday, especially in Texas, according to the Storm Prediction Center . Strong winds also were reported from east Texas to South Carolina, leaving numerous reports of downed trees across the region, the prediction center said.\nThe South still was dealing with substantial damage wrought by storms Wednesday. Tennessee was especially hard hit that day, with multiple tornadoes and water rescues amid flash flood emergencies in the state.\nAt least one tornado has been reported in the US every day since April 25 – a streak of 15 days and counting - and there have been more than 300 reported tornadoes during that span. April and May are the most active months for tornadoes and severe weather, and that reputation continued Thursday, when more than 60 million people in the South and East were at risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.\nA tornado emergency unfolded Wednesday evening in Maury County, located about 25 miles south of Nashville. The National Weather Service warned of a “confirmed large and destructive tornado” near the city of Spring Hill. The tornado killed one person and injured about a dozen others, according to county officials.\nIn northern Alabama, a “large and destructive tornado” prompted a tornado emergency in the area of Henagar, a city of a couple thousand people roughly 55 miles east of Huntsville, the National Weather Service said. It’s still unclear what, if any, damage the tornado caused in the area.\nHere’s the latest on ongoing storms and destruction in the central and southern US:\nAt least three dead in the South: One person was killed on Wednesday in Claiborne County, Tennessee, when a tree fell on their car amid intense storms, the county’s emergency management office said. Another person died in Tennessee after a tornado touched down in Maury County Wednesday evening. In North Carolina, one person was killed in Gaston County near Charlotte when a tree fell on their vehicle, officials said.\nTornado injures several, causes significant damage: About a dozen people were injured by the tornado in Maury County, Tennessee, officials confirmed in a press conference Thursday. At least one person is in serious condition, Maury Regional Medical Center spokesperson Rita Thompson told CNN. Video from the scene showed buildings torn to shreds, homes missing large sections of roofs and walls and large trees snapped in half.\nWater rescues amid flash flood emergencies: Up to 9 inches of rain triggered flash flood emergencies and water rescues in communities just north of Nashville, Tennessee, Wednesday evening. Flooding in Robertson County blocked roadways and forced water rescues, the county’s emergency management agency told CNN. Emergency crews have also responded to water rescue calls and evacuated flooded homes in Sumner County, the county’s emergency management director Ken Weidner said. Sumner County Schools are closed Thursday due to the flooding.",

    "text": "Veolia , líder mundial en tecnologías del agua, encabezará un innovador programa europeo de vigilancia epidemiológica que utilizará las aguas residuales como indicador de salud en tiempo real para detectar amenazas emergentes y proteger a las poblaciones urbanas del continente.\nSegún informó este miércoles, la compañía analizará hasta 500 muestras de aguas residuales recolectadas de ciudades europeas en sus laboratorios en España, sometiendo cada muestra a más de 500 análisis en profundidad para detectar contaminantes, virus, bacterias y residuos de medicamentos.\nEsta iniciativa se alinea con la directiva europea revisada sobre tratamiento de aguas residuales , que incorpora formalmente la vigilancia epidemiológica como pilar fundamental de la salud pública y forma parte de la estrategia europea \"One Health\".\nEl programa permitirá analizar el comportamiento colectivo, evaluar el impacto de las políticas públicas e identificar nuevas amenazas, fortaleciendo así la soberanía sanitaria de Europa, un principio que se ha reiterado recientemente en la Estrategia Europea para la Resiliencia del Agua.\nLiderazgo y colaboración La CEO de Veolia, Estelle Brachlianoff , destacó que este proyecto representa una \"encarnación concreta\" del plan estratégico GreenUp de la compañía, ofreciendo soluciones tanto medioambientales como para la salud ciudadana y la resiliencia territorial europea.\nEl proyecto se desarrollará en colaboración con el CSIC , Cetaqua y la Universidad de Santiago de Compostela , aprovechando más de una década de experiencia en el monitoreo de aguas residuales en Madrid, Barcelona y Sevilla.\nDaniel Tugues , CEO de Veolia España, señaló que la pandemia de Covid-19 reveló el potencial inexplorado de las aguas residuales para el monitoreo de la salud pública, colocando a España \"a la vanguardia de un nuevo enfoque de la salud ambiental\".\nExperiencia consolidada El programa forma parte de la iniciativa EU4Health , liderada por HaDEA, la Agencia Ejecutiva Europea de Salud y Digital de la Comisión Europea, destinada a monitorear el estado de salud de los europeos en las principales ciudades.\nLa vigilancia epidemiológica a través de las aguas residuales se ha convertido en una herramienta fundamental para anticipar riesgos sanitarios y activar medidas preventivas de manera temprana.\nEl sistema implementado por Veolia cubrirá casi un tercio de la población española a través de sus análisis en las tres principales ciudades del país, consolidando su posición como referente en el sector.\nImpacto en la salud pública Los análisis permitirán una detección temprana de amenazas sanitarias emergentes , facilitando respuestas más rápidas y efectivas por parte de las autoridades de salud pública.\nEste enfoque innovador representa un avance significativo en la manera de abordar la vigilancia epidemiológica a nivel continental, combinando rigor científico con tecnología de vanguardia.\nLa iniciativa refuerza el compromiso de Europa con la salud pública preventiva y demuestra el potencial de la colaboración entre el sector privado y las instituciones académicas y de investigación.",
