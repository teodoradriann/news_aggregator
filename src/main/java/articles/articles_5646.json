This implies that Ryugu could have had an underground ocean or lake, which may have been a spot for microorganisms to dwell.\nIntroduced from Science Alert on Thursday (04/07/2024), consultants have additionally been actively learning materials from the Ryugu asteroid. From the outcomes of this analysis, it was revealed that the asteroid Ryugu consists of a composition much like carbonaceous chondrite.\nChondrites are a sort of (non-metallic) rock meteorite that has not undergone any change from its authentic type. Such a meteor is created from various kinds of mud and particles of matter that existed within the prehistory of the photo voltaic system or on primitive asteroids.\nAs well as, the most recent examine discovered an abundance of heavy hydrogen and nitrogen substances. Each supplies are according to sources exterior the Photo voltaic System.\nThis makes consultants suspect that the asteroid Ryugu is older than the solar. This concept corresponds to the idea of comets, which says that they arrive from photo voltaic methods additional away.\n(Tiffany)\n2024-07-04 20:00:00\n#Meet #Asteroid #Ryugu #Older #Solar",

Authorities have issued flood warnings for low-lying areas, urging residents to evacuate and stay updated on safety measures\nChennai: Authorities issued a flood alert for low-lying areas along the Adyar River banks after releasing 1,000 cusecs of water from Chembarambakkam reservoir today. The reservoir, with a full capacity of 24 feet, currently stands at 23.29 feet, with inflows rising to 6,500 cusecs.\nThe decision to release water came after heavy rains pounded the Kanchipuram district, with the Chembarambakkam area recording 14 cm rainfall yesterday. This led to a significant increase in inflows, from 743 cubic feet yesterday morning to 6,500 cusecs currently.\nமுன்னெச்சரிக்கை நடவடிக்கைகள் செம்பரம்பாக்கம் ஏரியிலிருந்து நீர் வெளியேற்றம் 13.12.2024\n[pic.twitter.com/8vQXvT50hK]— tnsdma (@tnsdma)\n[December 13, 2024]\nFlood Warnings for Low-Lying Areas\nResidents in low-lying areas along the Adyar River banks have been advised to evacuate to relief camps. Water has now been released from the three largest lakes around Chennai – Chembarambakkam, Poondi and Puzhal lakes – resulting in water flowing into the city’s rivers.\nChembarambakkam Lake’s water level rose from 21.50 feet yesterday to over 23 feet, prompting officials to release surplus water. An order was issued to release 1,000 cubic feet per second after the water level crossed 22 feet. Flood warnings have been issued for villages along the banks, including Thirumudivakkam, Sirukalathur, Nandambakkam, Thiruneermalai and Vazhuthalampedu.\nPoondi Lake, another key water source for Chennai, has also seen increased water release. Currently, 12,760 cubic feet of water are being released, up from 5,000 cubic feet yesterday. With Poondi Lake overflowing at its full height of 35 feet, officials released additional water as a safety precaution. Puzhal Lake also releases 500 cubic feet of water.\nThe 2015 Chennai floods were largely caused by water release from Chembarambakkam Lake. While officials from the Water Resources Department and Public Works Department are closely monitoring the situation, residents remain concerned. Authorities ensure that necessary measures are being taken to ensure public safety.\nEvacuation efforts are underway, with residents advised to avoid travel to flood-prone areas and follow official updates. The situation remains under close watch as authorities work to mitigate potential flooding.\nClick for more latest [Tamil Nadu news](https://www.news9live.com/state/tamil-nadu).
