    "text": "Table of Contents\nTable of Contents\nThis is a serious threat\nExpensive is not always good\nJust over a year ago, a study published in the Advances in Infectious Diseases journal detailed that 95% of the wearable straps for smartwatches and fitness bands were infected with different kinds of harmful bacteria .\nNow, another research published in a reputed journal has revealed an even more sinister trend in straps sold for wrist-worn smart wearables. The paper, published in the ACS’ Environmental Science & Technology Letters, highlights the presence of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in fluoroelastomer bands offered by various top brands.\nThe bands tested as part of the chemical analysis include those offered by big names like Google, Samsung, Apple, Fitbit, and CASETiFY. Interestingly, Samsung and Apple both sell watch bands made out of fluoroelastomers, the core problematic chemical at the center of the research, and even mention its “benefits” on their websites.\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\nThe research paper raises concern about “the very high concentration of PFHxA that can be readily extracted from the surfaces of watch bands made from fluoroelastomers.” The more worrisome part is that people wear these smart devices for more than daytime activities.\nNOTE : The American Chemical Society (ACS) provided Digital Trends with a copy of the research paper and the supporting information covering the test protocol and analysis methodology for their assessment.\nAs features like sleep-quality monitoring and sleep apnea detection enter the mainstream, people are supposed to wear them even while sleeping. “Wearing these items for more than 12 hours per day poses an opportunity for significant transfer to the dermis and subsequent human exposure,” surmises the research team.\nThis is a serious threat Nadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends The research highlights how multiple straps were advertised to “sports and fitness” enthusiasts, which means they are worn during exercise. It could lead to increased sweat contact and open skin pores.\nApple, Samsung, and Google sell bands made out of fluoroelastomers.\nPFHxAs fall in a particularly dangerous class of chemicals known as forever chemicals, and have gained the infamous name because they persist and avoid the regular cycle of environmental breakdown. What’s worrisome is that their detrimental impact is yet to be explored fully.\nNadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends A frequent presence in everything from cosmetics and cookware to clothing and electronics, they have been used for decades in consumer as well as industrial items, particularly owing to their resilience against heat, water, oil, and grease exposure. However, in recent years, their destructive impact has gained widespread recognition.\nA significant percentage could pass through human skin under normal conditions.\nForever chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health issues, including cancer , and their presence has been documented in potable water supplies, soil, and even food items. As per the United States Environmental Protection Agency, PFHxA is one of the breakdown outcomes of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\nExpensive is not always good Apple sells watch bands made out of fluoroelastomers. Nadeem Sarwar / Digital Trends As part of the research, the team focused on fluoroelastomers, which are essentially a class of synthetic rubbers made from PFAS, looking for the presence of fluorine and over a dozen other harmful chemicals. Interestingly, the more expensive bands exhibited a stronger presence of harmful chemicals than the cheaper ones.\nOf the 22 bands and straps analyzed by the team, all the fluoroelastomer bands showed the presence of fluorine. Interestingly, bands that were not even explicitly made out of fluoroelastomer revealed the presence of fluorine, which is a strong sign of PFAS presence.\nA subsequent chemical extraction process revealed the presence of PFHxA as the most common forever chemical in nine out of the 22 straps. On average, the PFHxA concentration came in at 800 parts per billion (ppb), which is four times higher than cosmetics. In one case, the concentration was as high as 16,000 parts per billion (ppb).\nAs per the research team, the high levels of PFHxA detected in the wristbands may be due to the use of this compound as a surfactant during the fluoroelastomer manufacturing process.\nA high portion of these chemicals pass through the skin, and enter the bloodstream.\nAlyssa Wicks, co-author of the research paper, recommends that customers should focus on lower-priced bands for their smartwatches and fitness bands if they seek to avoid PFHxA exposure.\n“If the consumer wishes to purchase a higher-priced band, we suggest that they read the product descriptions and avoid any that are listed as containing fluoroelastomers,” Wicks was quoted as saying. She suggests that the next time you go shopping for straps and bands, look for the word fluoroelastomer and avoid them, if possible.",

Everybody’s off. It’s the holiday season, we’re between Christmas and New Year’s. People want to be on vacation. They can’t be They can’t afford to be on vacation. In fact, they’re looking at this and they’re saying, well, wait a minute. Up until the last minute, we were told you were working from Camp David, and then at the very last minute, suddenly everything changes and he’s going to the U.S. Virgin Islands. I mean, give me a break. The American people are looking at this and saying this was not the year, my friend. You’re campaigning. You should be showing us that you’re going to do the job instead of taking your, what, 417th day vacation since you’ve been president. This is completely outrageous. But will the American people come out and vote? That’s what I’m asking for. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat, independent, are you going to vote for a president that’s actually going to work for you? And you talk about spending. When am I going to hear one of these candidates talk about making sure that we’re trying to balance the budget at some point? Because I think all Americans are saying, hey, we’re having to balance our budget. When are you going to decide what to cut and how we’re going to get back on track in the United States?” To hear what else she had to say to Jason, listen to the podcast!

    "text": "Dawson Templin, a third-year biochemistry and economics student, is one of seven justices on the Student Government Association Supreme Court who oversee elections and uphold the University of Georgia’s constitutional policies. Templin is also a UGA Public Service and Outreach Student Scholar who interns with Hart County to help aid and rebuild their community.\nQ: As a biochemistry and economics student, how are you able to foster your interest in law and government?\nMy father is retired Air Force, so I never necessarily grew up around law, but I did grow up around government. For probably six, seven years of my life, I was like, “I’m going to medical school,” so I never really considered it. And then when I kind of made the decision, you know, I’m not going to medical school, I started to open the horizons to it. In the Department of Management, I did a\nresearch project focused on hospital administrators, and how their educational credentials — Do they have a medical degree? Do they have a juris doctorate? Do they have an MBA? — affects that hospital’s national rankings. What I found is that most really large hospital systems and even some of the largest hospital systems, or individual hospitals in the country, are actually led by people that have juris doctorates, which I found was very interesting.\nQ: Why is it important for you to be a part of SGA?\nIt definitely offers you an ability to actually see problems that face the university. But then also, it allows you to make change because it’s one of the only organizations where you can actually work with administration here at UGA.\nQ: Is there a particular relationship that you have made with an administrator that stands out to you?\nMy research mentor, I met her in a University Council meeting that I had through a position that I was selected for because of SGA. She had just happened to find me in a meeting and was like, “Hey, do you mind if I sit next to you?” And so she sat down, and we just really hit it off. Now I’m in her research lab.\nQ: How are you involved with other communities and local governments as a\nUGA Public Service and Outreach Student Scholar?\nThere’s eight Archway communities, and so eight counties within the state of Georgia that have been classified as more for need. And so UGA has people that live in those counties to actually help with community development. I am working with Hart County, which is a little bit northeast of Athens, and my project is looking like it’ll be doing work with sustainability development goals in relation to health care. I work with my\nArchway Professional, and then she is the one that is connected to all of the people in the government, the community, not even just governmental leaders, also business leaders, just different ones that kind of make up the community and actually understand the needs.\nComments trimmed for length and clarity.\nJennifer Natunen is a public relations major covering city-county government.\n-\nShow Comments (0)",

    "text": "MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk nuclear power station, around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the fighting in the Russian border region. The Kremlin leader did not present any evidence for his claims or provide further details on the alleged attack. “The enemy tried to strike the nuclear power plant at night, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been informed,” Putin said in a televised government meeting. There were no previous reports of an attempted strike on the facility in Russian media, which has been in focus since Ukraine launched a major cross-border offensive into the Kursk region on August 6. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi is planning to visit the Kursk nuclear plant next week, an agency spokesperson told AFP earlier on Thursday. Kyiv and Moscow have traded accusations of threatening nuclear safety throughout the 2.5-year conflict. In the meanwhile, Russia’s army on Thursday claimed it had captured another village in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the latest in a string of territorial advances for Moscow’s troops. The defence ministry in Moscow said its forces had captured the village of Mezhove, located between Avdiivka, captured in February, and the logistics hub of Pokrovsk, toward which Russian troops are advancing. Moscow has pushed on with its offensive in the Donetsk region even as it tries to fight off a Ukrainian counter-assault into its own Kursk border region. Facing manpower and ammunition shortages for much of 2024, Ukraine has been pushed onto the back foot in the industrial eastern region following months of stalemate. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed to capture new settlements in the area on an almost daily basis in recent weeks. They include towns such as New York, which have been the focus of heavy fighting and artillery raids for months, as well as tiny villages, consisting of little more than a single street and a handful of abandoned buildings. Ukraine is evacuating civilians from the city of Pokrovsk and its surrounding areas, about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the fighting, where officials say some 50,000 still live.",

    "text": "The last few days of 2023 will see strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. An area of low pressure which pushes in from the west on Saturday will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year.\nThe challenging conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased, but Friday will be blustery with showers, some heavy, with some central locations likely to see the brightest conditions. During the early hours of Saturday morning a potentially deep area of low pressure will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK.\nAs the system moves eastwards, the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. It is possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland.\nSteven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of\nweather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nNick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”\nThousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday.\nPower company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected.\nThey said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nNational Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire\nPolice said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\nFerry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",
