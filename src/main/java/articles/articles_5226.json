    "title": "Family says man received MAID on psychiatric day pass, files wrongful-death lawsuit",
    "text": "VANCOUVER - The family of a 52-year-old man who received medical assistance in dying while on a day pass from a Vancouver psychiatric hospital has launched a constitutional challenge to the procedure’s legal framework.\nThe notice of civil claim filed Friday at the B.C. Supreme Court says the businessman and father of three, who suffered chronic back pain and long-term mental illness, suffered wrongful death in December 2022.\nIt accuses Dr. Ellen Wiebe and her clinic of malpractice, though none of the allegations have been proven in court.\nAnother patient of Wiebe’s clinic was the subject of an urgent injunction less than two months ago, when a B.C. judge halted an Alberta woman’s medically assisted death, the day before Wiebe was scheduled to perform the procedure in Vancouver.\nFriday’s notice of claim, which only identifies the man by initials, says that while MAID’s framework excludes people solely suffering from mental illnesses, it does not supply similar safeguards for those with “concurrent mental and physical illnesses,” heightening risks of premature death.\nThe family is seeking damages for alleged wrongful death as well as a declaration that the man’s Charter rights were breached and that the MAID framework is invalid and unconstitutional.\nWiebe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe lawsuit says the man was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2013. It said he was also suffering chronic back pain, but this injury was neither grievous nor incurable enough to make him eligible for MAID.\nThe notice says he sought and received approval for MAID — though it did not include a date.\nBut the notice says he then decided to pursue treatment and rehabilitation instead.\nApplicants whose sole medical condition is mental illness will remain ineligible under MAID until at least March 2027.\nThe man’s family obtained a court order under the Mental Health Act to commit him to a psychiatric ward at St. Paul’s Hospital, the lawsuit says. It claims the hospital and his doctors “negligently or recklessly” allowed him to leave the hospital and undergo MAID.\nThe notice says the family only learned of his death afterward.\nThey claim the man was not capable of making decisions about his health at the time and allege his choice was influenced by concerns about his finances. It says he did not give informed consent “as he lacked capacity to do so.”\nIn the case of the Alberta woman whose medically assisted death was halted in October, the judge who issued the injunction said she appeared to have a mental health condition with no physical ailment.\nWiebe was interviewed for a BBC documentary that screened this year, telling an interviewer that she had been involved with more than 400 MAID deaths.\nShe said there were situations “where I find someone not eligible or eligible when another person won’t, because of the way our law is written.”\nWiebe told the BBC the “No. 1 reason” people wanted MAID was to maintain “autonomy and control.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 19, 2024.",

    "title": "Pothugadda Review: The Aadukalam Naren film is routine thriller with forced emotions",
    "text": "Pothugadda Review: The Aadukalam Naren film has a very good backdrop and a few thrills. But the emotions look out of place. The film was made available for streaming on Jan 30, 2025, on ETV Win.\nPothugadda review\nLast Updated: 12.34 PM, Jan 31, 2025\nIn the small town of Pothugadda, MLA Samudra (Aadukalam Naren) appoints his daughter, Geetha (Krheah Raj), as Youth President to secure power. Meanwhile, his rival Bhaskar (Shatru) plans to bribe voters with ₹50 crore. Geetha, neglected by her father, falls in love with Krishna (Prudhvi Dandamudi) and decides to elope. When Samudra learns of her escape, he orders his aide, Venkat, to kill Krishna and bring her back. Coincidentally, Bhaskar’s bribe is being transported in the same bus that Geetha and Krishna board. Will they escape? Will the bribe make it across the border? Find out by streaming the film on ETV Win now.\nPothugadda has been written and directed by Raksha Veeram and features an interesting premise. Most of the film takes place on a bus, with various conflicts and issues unfolding during the journey. While this aspect is engaging, it takes some time to get there, which can feel slow and detracts from the overall grip on the story.\nPothugadda is quite weak when it comes to emotions. The way Geetha is made Youth President and her relationship with her strict father isn’t handled well. More than anything, the love story between Geetha and Krishna doesn’t emotionally connect with the audience. Everything is established too quickly, and some scenes are given undue importance, which isn’t necessary.\nBased on a real incident, the faction backdrop may not be new to Telugu audiences, but the setting is fresh, and since most of the film happens on a bus, things stay interesting. A few thrilling moments, where the couple smartly handles goons, are showcased decently. However, the tension that should make the audience feel for the couple is lacking.\nThe thrills and character behaviors are good, but the weak emotions fail to hold attention. The faction-based scenes feel routine and boring as they have been done in many films before.\nAs for the performances, Aadukalam Naren excels as the rude politician, bringing depth to the proceedings. The concept of honour killing is routine, but Naren's performance adds a unique touch. Pushpa fame Shatru is also good, but his track could have been handled better.\nPrudhvi Dandamudi plays the male lead and is just okay. He needs to work on his expressions, as he was only decent in the film. Krheah Raj plays the female lead and is perfectly cast for the role.\nMarcus composed the music, and his work is impressive. Considering the budget and the night setting, the visuals are great. Since most of the film happens in a bus, the camerawork beautifully captures the mood. However, the editing could have been better, as the faction-related scenes should have been wrapped up quicker.\nDirector Raksha Veeram has done a good job setting the film in a solid backdrop, but the lack of emotional depth causes it to lose momentum quickly.\nOn the whole, Pothugadda has a decent backdrop and a few thrills that impress. But the lack of depth in the core emotional plot and tension in the proceedings makes it a routine thriller.",
