    "text": "Unionized Boeing factory workers asked the company for a 40 percent wage hike to avoid a strike. Boeing offered them 25 percent. A strike it is! On Thursday, an overwhelming 96 percent of Boeing workers voted in favor of a work stoppage, the first in 16 years for the troubled aviation company.\nMembers of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 751 voted almost unanimously to reject a proposed four-year agreement that would address a series of long-standing grievances but didn’t address them well enough. The union says the proposed deal failed to meet the union’s demands for higher wages and better job security.\nThe Boeing strike affects assembly plants in Washington state, including its Everett and Renton plants, and could disrupt the company’s vast network of suppliers across the United States.\nThe financial impact of the strike could be severe. Analysts estimate that a month-long work stoppage could cost Boeing approximately $1.5 billion, compounding the company’s existing financial woes.\nBoeing has struggled with safety and manufacturing issues in recent years, including a significant crisis involving its 737 Max aircraft , which faced grounding and production delays due to safety concerns.\nThere was optimism last week after the tentative deal, which featured the 25% raise over four years. But maybe the optimistic folks involved should have spoken to IAM District 751 President John Holden, who, in the immediate aftermath of the proposal, told the Seattle Times that the deal would likely be rejected.\nOne of the key points of contention was the elimination of an annual bonus program that workers would like to see brought back. Other workers who spoke to the Washington Post want to see a change in the company’s mandatory overtime rules. There’s still a ton of key sticking points to iron out. As one union member reportedly put it before voting for the Boeing strike, “Four years is not enough to make up for the last 16.”\nThe post Boeing Workers Strike After Nearly Unanimously Vote appeared first on VICE .\nThe post Boeing Workers Strike After Nearly Unanimously Vote appeared first on VICE .",

    "text": "Paris Paralympics 2024: Alfie Hewett sets up gold medal matches in singles & doubles • 2 MINUTE READ Alfie Hewett is through to the men’s wheelchair tennis singles final at the 2024 Paris Paralympic Games after a straight sets victory over world No.3 Martin De La Puente. The world No.1 defeated the Spaniard 6-2, 6-0 to punch his ticket into a second Paralympics singles final. [Hewett](/fan-zone/british-tennis-players/alfie-hewett/) is now in the gold medal match for the singles and doubles draw at Roland Garros and will be aiming to complete the career golden slam in both formats. He’s the first men’s player to reach the singles and doubles finals at the same Games on multiple occasions. \"It’s a great feeling,\" Hewett said. \"It was incredible match, I think I played probably one of my best performances, best matches and to do it in the semi-finals of a Paralympics is a big ask but I’m very proud of my level. \"I’ve been building in the week. Coming in I felt confident off the back of Wimbledon – I feel like I’m in a new chapter of my career. Coming here I’m just playing with freedom and trying to enjoy it. I think it’s definitely up there with some of my best tennis so let’s hope it keeps going. The 2016 singles silver medallist will have his eyes on the biggest prize on Saturday when he faces world No.2 Tokito Oda in the final. Hewett will also join forces with [Gordon Reid](/fan-zone/british-tennis-players/gordon-reid/) to face Oda and his partner Takuya Miki in tomorrow’s men’s doubles final starting not before 15:00. \"We’ve played a lot against each other in recent years, especially in big tournaments,\" he added. \"I’m sure it’s going to be a good match and I’m just really happy to make the final, I’m proud of that achievement. I’ll leave it all out there again and see what happens.\" As with their final at Wimbledon just a few months ago, it was a masterclass in aggressive returning from Hewett – who dropped only one point on the Spaniard’s serve in the first set. Hewett had been having a few problems of his own on serve but a series of errors from De La Puente with the Brit serving at 3-2, 40-40 gave him a pivotal hold that steadied the ship and set him on a run of 10 straight games. Mistakes proved costly for the Spanish No.1 and after being broken for a fourth time, he fired long on Hewett’s second set point to hand a one set lead to the top seed. Hewett had won 22 of their previous 23 meetings and the confidence was oozing through him at the start of the second set. In the opening game he hit an incredible no-look reverse backhand on his way to an early break advantage. De La Puente was unable to match the power and precision coming off the Hewett racket. Facing break point again at 2-0 down, the Spaniard hit a great wide serve, but Hewett was equal to it with a driven backhand winner. It remained the story of the match and as the 26-year-old clocked his 26th winner, he sealed an impressive win in an hour and nine minutes.",

    "text": "Turkish police on Thursday released seven workers taken hostage by a pro-Palestinian gunman at a plant near Istanbul owned by US consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble in protest over the war in Gaza .\nPolice staged a raid nearly nine hours into the stand-off when the lone gunman took a bathroom break.\nThe man was detained unharmed, local governor Seddar Yavuz told reporters.\n“The man’s aim was to stop Israel’s massacre in Gaza and to open the Rafa gate in Egypt” for the delivery of humanitarian aid for trapped civilians, Yavuz said.\n“When he went out for a bathroom break, our security forces carried out an operation without harming the hostages.”\nPhotos and videos of the assailant shared online by one of the hostages showed a man – his face hidden by a Palestinian scarf – holding a gun with what appeared to be a suicide vest strapped to his chest.\nHe was standing next to a drawing of the Palestinian flag and the words “the door will be opened for Gaza” painted on the wall in red.\nYavuz said the man was carrying two guns and appeared to have explosives strapped to his chest, adding that “we had to evaluate every possibility”.\nDistressed relatives of the hostages who had gathered at the cordoned-off facility broke into applause when informed about their loved ones’ release by local officials.\n“We are very happy after the tense long hours of waiting,” said Fatma Dursun, whose nephew was taken hostage.\n“Thank God they are all safe and sound,” she said.\nP&G’s head office in Cincinnati confirmed the incident. A spokesperson said: “The safety of P&G people and our partners is our top priority. Earlier today, we evacuated our Gebze facility and are working with local authorities to resolve an urgent security situation.”\nP&G Turkey employs 700 people at three sites across Istanbul and Kocaeli, according to the company’s website. It produces cleaning and hygiene brands such as Ariel washing powder and Oral B toothpaste.\nPublic feeling against Israel and its main ally the US has risen in Turkey since the conflict began, with regular protests in support of the Palestinian people in major cities and calls for an immediate ceasefire.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, has been particularly outspoken, referring to Israeli “war crimes” and comparing Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s prime minister, to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\nThe US Embassy in Ankara issued a warning in November about demonstrations that are “critical of US foreign policy” and call for boycotts of US businesses. The advice followed protests and attacks on outlets such as McDonald’s and Starbucks over the conflict in Gaza.\nThe post Hostage situation at Turkish factory ends after gunman takes a bathroom break appeared first on The Telegraph .",

    "text": "Un étudiant imprime en 3D son propre skateboard électrique sur-mesure\nElliot S.\nLe monde de l’impression 3D a connu une forte croissance dans la création d’objets fonctionnels, allant des\nplanches de surf personnalisées aux caractéristiques de glisse optimisées aux composants de vélo légers qui améliorent les performances et le confort. Suivant cette vague d’innovation, Mike Elrod, étudiant en cinquième année de génie mécanique à l’Institut de technologie de Rochester, a mis à profit son expertise créative pour concevoir et fabriquer son propre skateboard électrique en utilisant des techniques d’impression 3D avancées. Inspiré par son expérience de stage chez le célèbre constructeur de véhicules électriques Tesla, Elrod était déterminé à exploiter la fabrication additive pour créer un skateboard électrique innovant et personnel, tout en satisfaisant sa passion pour la créativité et l’ingénierie.\nAnimé par le désir d’explorer le potentiel des matériaux de qualité technique dans l’impression 3D, Elrod s’est lancé dans la concrétisation de ses idées. « J’ai toujours voulu utiliser des matériaux et des filaments de qualité technique pour fabriquer des pièces fonctionnelles pour l’impression 3D« , a déclaré Elrod. « Ce n’est pas toujours intéressant de faire des bibelots ; je veux l’utiliser pour l’ingénierie.«\nFort de sa formation en génie mécanique, Elrod a soigneusement conçu et imprimé en 3D tous les éléments principaux du skateboard, y compris le plateau, les essieux et le boîtier électrique. En incorporant des filaments renforcés en fibres de carbone dans la conception, il s’est assuré que la flexibilité et la résistance du skateboard puissent répondre aux exigences d’une utilisation quotidienne. De plus, Mike a mis en œuvre des composants spécialisés pour perfectionner encore la direction et la maniabilité, ce qui a permis d’améliorer la conception générale et l’expérience utilisateur de son skateboard.\nLe produit final est un skateboard électrique ultramoderne et entièrement personnalisé, équipé d’une puissante batterie de 36 volts, capable d’atteindre des vitesses allant jusqu’à 32 km/h. Doté de pneus robustes de 6,5 pouces, le skateboard peut naviguer en toute sécurité sur des terrains variés, des surfaces lisses aux sentiers tout-terrain difficiles. Les utilisateurs peuvent piloter le skateboard électrique imprimé en 3D à l’aide d’une télécommande portable pour une utilisation facile.\nTout au long du projet, Mike Elrod a activement recherché les connaissances et le soutien des communautés d’ingénierie et\nd’impression 3D en ligne, ce qui l’a aidé à affiner ses conceptions et à trouver des idées pour améliorer le skateboard. En parlant du processus de conception, il explique : « Je connaissais la communauté, l’industrie et les forums. De nombreuses entreprises ont vu le jour au cours des 10 dernières années et fabriquent des moteurs et des contrôleurs de moteur, qui sont le cerveau, les batteries et tous les petits éléments électroniques.«\nLe projet de cet étudiant illustre le potentiel passionnant de l’impression 3D pour le transport personnalisé. À mesure que la technologie de fabrication additive continue d’évoluer, on peut s’attendre à voir apparaître des options de transport encore plus innovantes et personnalisées dans les années à venir.

    "text": "SEATTLE, USA – Boeing’s US West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96% voted on Thursday, September 12, in favor of a strike, halting production of the planemaker’s strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt.\nThe workers’ first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time on Friday (0700 GMT), just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January.\nRoughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing’s 737 MAX, and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas were voting on their first full contract in 16 years.\nUnder complicated rules set by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), at least two-thirds of the unionized workers had to vote in favor of a strike for a stoppage to begin and the contract to be rejected.\nBoeing workers voted 96% in favor of striking and 94.6% to reject the agreement.\nThe deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing’s next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program is launched within the four years of the contract.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\nOn Wednesday, Ortberg sent a letter to workers, urging them to approve the deal.\nSome workers were already preparing for picket lines that day, with one union member leaving a Wednesday meeting carrying a placard under her arm that read: “On Strike Against Boeing.” – Rappler.com",
