    "title": "Effective against asthma, this medication helps prevent certain food allergies",
    "text": "Published on\nUpdated\nReading 4 min.\nin collaboration with\nLaurent Guilleminault (Allergist)\nAnd\nSébastien Lefèvre (Allergist)\nAn asthma medication, Xolair, may reduce severe allergic reactions in asthma sufferers following an exposure accident, according to the results of a new study.\nThe main treatment for food allergy is the avoidance of the allergen in question. But exposure accidents are possible, causing a risk to the health of the allergic person. Indeed, in the event of exposure, a serious allergic reaction, including anaphylactic shock which can cause death, is rare but possible. The treatment is an immediate injection of epinephrine, via auto-injectable pen.\nAn asthma medication, Xolair, could reduce severe allergic reactions in people who suffer from it in the event of an exposure accident. Xolair is a treatment for moderate to severe allergic asthma, developed by Genentech and Novartis in the United States and approved since 2003 by the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.\nXolair, asthma medication, tested to limit food allergy reactions\nIn this study, researchers recruited 180 volunteers with a history of peanut allergy and at least two other food allergies. Each was randomly assigned to a group that received an injection of omalizumab (Xolair) or a placebo every two to four weeks for 16 to 20 weeks. All but three participants were 17 or younger, the researchers noted. The three adults in the study were between 19 and 28 years old. When analyzing the results, the researchers looked at all 177 participants aged 1 to 17 years old.\n“Of our 177 volunteers, 68 were 5 years old or younger” explains Dr. Robert Wood, lead author of the study and director of the division of allergy, immunology and rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, in Baltimore, United States. Before this trial, Xolair did not had never been studied in patients under the age of 6. This is particularly important, according to the researchers, because the prevalence of food allergies peaks between the ages of one and two. In total, 118 participants received omalizumab while 59 received a placebo.\nRegular injections of Xolair reduced the severity of allergic reactions\nResults: After 16 weeks of treatment, the study showed that 79 of 118 patients – or about 67% – who received repeated injections of omalizumab were able to tolerate at least 600 milligrams of peanut protein, which is equivalent to about a little more than two peanuts.\nBetter still, 44% were able to successfully consume a cumulative dose of 6,044 milligrams of peanut protein, which is equivalent to approximately 25 peanuts. In comparison, only 7% of participants – or four out of 59 – who received placebo injections were able to tolerate the same dose. Additionally, participants who received omalizumab were also more likely to tolerate other allergens such as cashew, egg, and milk, compared to the placebo group. “This is an incredible advancement in our field.” says Dr. Sharon Chinthrajah, lead author of the study and associate professor at Stanford University. “There is so much fear and anxiety in daily activities for food allergy patients or for parents of a food allergy patient“.\nWhen a food allergy develops, it is our body that reacts by producing IgE antibodies that respond to a specific allergen, such as milk or peanut, for example. Each time the food is ingested, an allergic reaction will be triggered by these antibodies.\n“The goal of Xolair is to bind and block these IgE antibodies, preventing an allergic reaction.” says Dr. Wood again.\nRegarding their study, the specialist highlights some limitations: the fact that only three adults were included and the fact that the cohort was “mainly of Caucasian origin, which could reduce the generalizability of the results“Another major obstacle to this potential treatment is its price: $2,900 for children and $5,000 for adults each month.\nTowards a treatment for people suffering from food allergies?\nFor Professor Laurent Guilleminault, pneumo-allergist at Toulouse University Hospital, “this very well-conducted study shows for the first time the effect of omalizumab on food allergy in children and adolescents. Taking into account the fact that the desensitization orally is available, the question will be which patients will be treated with omalizumab and which will receive desensitization.”. He also specifies that “for the moment in France, there is no marketing authorization for this medicine in food allergy“.\nA statement confirmed by Dr Sébastien Lefèvre, head of the Allergology department at Metz University Hospital. “Xolair is an exceptional medicine. In the context of food allergies, it can only be prescribed in patients including a clinical study protocol – excluding marketing authorization (AMM) – and the first prescription must be made in hospital. he explains first. “In patients who benefit from it – due to a very low allergen tolerance threshold – it works very well, but be careful, we cannot, for the moment, say that it is a food allergy treatment” estimates the doctor. In France, the dose of Xolair costs 300 euros, with an injection to be renewed every two weeks or every month.",

    "title": "Moonlit scramble across the sand for Turkey's booming baby turtle population",
    "text": "The baby loggerhead sea turtles emerged from their eggshells and began their first challenge in life: a wobbly dash across the sand to the moonlit waters of Turkey's Mediterranean coast—sometimes with a helping hand from volunteers.It is a perilous journey into the unknown for the sea turtles as only about one in 1,000 hatchlings will survive to adulthood.Some 25 years later, the females will return to the beach where they were born to lay their own eggs.Despite grave threats from humans and predators such as birds, crabs and ants, protection measures are bearing fruit on Turkey's southern coast.In Manavgat, a tourist hotspot nestled in the foothills of mountains and prized for its golden sands and stunning waterfall, the number of nests has doubled from last year to 700.A group of volunteers holds vigil around the clock along the 10-kilometer (six-mile) coastline, located east of the local tourism capital of Antalya.It is a major breeding area for the globally endangered loggerheads—also known as caretta caretta—which are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) red list of threatened species.\"Our average estimate this year is around 60,000 eggs; 30,000 of them will become babies; only 30 of them will come back years later\" to breed, Seher Akyol, founding president of DEKAFOK marine conservation center, told AFP.Turkey's southern coast is home to 21 official nesting areas—eight of them in Antalya alone.Protection measures have been put in place, such as limiting the use of light and the speed of sea vessels.Many beaches are declared protected areas and are off-limits from 8 pm to 8 am.Manavgat, though, is not one of them, so volunteers have taken on the task of protecting the breeding nests.Akyol's volunteers, including young students from all over Turkey and abroad, mark the nests, framing them with sticks and keeping the eggs protected from sunbathers.At night, they patrol beaches, dig in nests with their bare hands and, donning white gloves, help baby turtles break from their shells and crawl to the sea.Local officials also support volunteer initiatives.Manavgat's mayor, Niyazi Nefi Kara, has placed red lights on roadsides along the coast. Signs that read \"Attention! Caretta Nesting Area\" dot the beach.Under the environmental law, anyone who damages sea turtles and their nests can be fined 387,141 liras ($11,700).Kara said his office takes advice from \"scientists and environmentalists\" on protecting the turtles.\"After all, we need to learn how to live in harmony with nature,\" he said.Akyol added that \"people and caretta caretta can live together\".Songul Sert, 33, who was picnicking with her family around a wooden table near the beach, said \"we do our best so as not to usurp their living space\" with help from the signs.Another local, Hasan Gulec, said that previously a lack of signs meant that \"nobody knew where they were breeding, so anyone could walk on nests\".However, an AFP team saw some hotels along the beach still using the bright white lights that anger environmentalists.Loggerheads, whose overall numbers are unknown, can live for up to 80 years. Their weight ranges from 90-180 kilograms (200-400 pounds) and they can reach 1.2 meters (four feet) in length.The small percentage of hatchlings that return to the beach to breed is why \"they are endangered and need to be protected,\" Professor Mehmet Cengiz Deval of Akdeniz University's faculty of fisheries told AFP.Loggerhead sea turtles are found primarily in subtropical and temperate regions of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in the Mediterranean Sea.According to IUCN, the Mediterranean loggerhead is considered of \"least concern\", though the species remains vulnerable globally.Climate change is also a factor that threatens the species.The sex of hatchlings is determined by the temperature of the sand: cooler temperatures produce males and warmer ones produce females.High temperatures from July onwards means that \"most of the babies are females,\" Deval said.\"If this trend continues, in 30-40 years females will be the majority and there will be no male partners for them to breed. This is the biggest danger.\"Akyol, who dreams of building a rehabilitation center to treat injured turtles, cannot hide her excitement each time she sends them off to the water.\"I cannot forget their last look before meeting with the water,\" she said. \"It's as if they show how grateful they are.\"",

    "text": "Comer pasta no tiene por qué estar reñido con una dieta saludable. Así lo afirma el cirujano bariátrico Leonardo Rejón, quien desde su cuenta de Instagram ha revolucionado la percepción sobre este alimento tradicionalmente considerado “enemigo” de la báscula\n. ¿Su mensaje? Todo depende de cómo la cocine.\nCon más de 20 años de experiencia y más de 35.000 seguidores, el doctor ha explicado en un vídeo viral por qué la pasta al dente es mucho más beneficiosa que la pasta bien cocida. Y no, no es solo una cuestión de gusto italiano.\n¿Cuál es el truco de los italianos para comer pasta sin engordar?\n“Los italianos no engordan comiendo pasta porque la cocinan al dente”, explica Rejón. Esta técnica de cocción, que deja la pasta ligeramente firme al morder, impide que el cuerpo absorba gran parte del almidón, transformándolo en una fibra no digerible. El resultado: menor índice glucémico, mayor saciedad, digestión más lenta y mejor masticación.\nEl experto asegura que optar por la cocción al dente es clave para quienes buscan cuidar su salud metabólica, controlar el apetito e incluso perder peso. Una tradición culinaria milenaria que, según la ciencia, podría ser más efectiva que muchas dietas modernas.\nPublicidad\nAlgunos puntos importantes sobre la pasta y el peso:\n- Calorías y porciones: Una porción moderada de pasta cocida (alrededor de una taza) tiene una cantidad de calorías razonable, generalmente menos de 200. El problema suele venir con las porciones grandes y las salsas ricas en grasas y calorías.\n- Índice Glucémico (IG): La pasta, especialmente la de trigo duro y cocida \"al dente\", tiene un índice glucémico bajo a medio. Esto significa que los carbohidratos se digieren y absorben más lentamente, lo que ayuda a mantener los niveles de azúcar en la sangre estables y puede contribuir a una mayor sensación de saciedad. La pasta integral tiene un IG aún más bajo debido a su mayor contenido de fibra.\n- Valor nutricional: La pasta no es solo carbohidratos. También aporta algunas proteínas, fibra (especialmente la integral), hierro y vitaminas del grupo B.\n- Lo que realmente importa: El aumento de peso está más relacionado con un balance calórico positivo (consumir más calorías de las que quemas) que con un alimento específico. Si comes grandes cantidades de pasta con salsas cremosas, quesos y carnes grasas, es más probable que aumentes de peso.",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 The U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020 Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness As of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month The marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Veteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% 6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020 In 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "text": "U.S. Mint's American Women Quarters Program announces 2024 honorees\nThis year's quarters pay tribute to a civil rights activist, an influential singer and a Civil War surgeon.\nLEARN MORE\nIt started in New York City in 1909 as National Woman's Day. Now, Women's History Month is celebrated with events worldwide.\nWomen's History Month is an annual celebration of the achievements and contributions of women throughout history, celebrated every March.\nBefore there was Women's History Month, there was Women's Day. Feb. 28, 1909, marked a pivotal moment in history when women stood up for their rights and made their voices heard at the first official National Woman's Day in New York City.\nA group of Manhattan socialists and suffragists organized this event to recognize the first anniversary of the garment strike led by the\nInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. This meeting was purposely held on a Sunday so people wouldn't miss work. In March 1910, German activist Clara Zetkin proposed that International Women's Day be recognized as an international holiday at the International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. All 17 countries in attendance agreed to this proposal. On March 18, 1911, several European countries officially celebrated International Women's Day; more than 1 million activists from Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands and Denmark took part in at least 300 demonstrations.\nOver the course of the century the celebration of the day waxed and waned with world events until the advent of second-wave feminism in the 1960s, when it started to gain momentum again. The United Nations first celebrated International Women's Day in 1975.\nIn 1978, Santa Rosa, California educators began celebrating Women's History Week, planning it to correspond with International Women's Day. It was a way to recognize and celebrate the vital role that women have played in American history and culture. The event, organized by the Education Task Force of Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women, included lectures, workshops, and other activities to honor women's contributions to society.\nThis year marks the 45th anniversary of Women's History Week.\nA more significant movement toward recognizing and celebrating women's accomplishments with Women's History Week began in 1978. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued a proclamation declaring March 2-8 as Women's History Week. In his proclamation, Carter acknowledged women's vital contributions in building America and called for greater recognition of their achievements. He also used the moment to advocate for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\"I ask my fellow Americans to recognize this heritage with appropriate activities during National Women's History Week, March 2-8, 1980,\" former President Carter said in his statement. \"I urge libraries, schools, and community organizations to focus their observances on the leaders who struggled for equality — Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucy Stone, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Tubman and Alice Paul. Understanding the true history of our country will help us to comprehend the need for full equality under the law for all our people.\"\nBy 1986, 14 states had declared March as Women's History Month. This growing momentum and state-by-state action were used to build a case for lobbying Congress to establish March as National Women's History Month. In 1987, Congress passed Public Law 100-9, which designated March National Women's History Month. Since 1995, every president has issued an annual proclamation honoring the achievements and contributions of women throughout American history. In addition, many countries around the world have also recognized March as a time to celebrate and honor women.\nThis year's quarters pay tribute to a civil rights activist, an influential singer and a Civil War surgeon.\nToday, Women's History Month is celebrated with events worldwide to commemorate and encourage the study, observance and celebration of women's vital role in history. We are reminded that by recognizing and honoring these accomplishments, we can continue building a better future for everyone, regardless of gender or background.\nThe theme for Women's History Month changes every year, but the goal remains: To recognize and honor women who have impacted their communities, countries and the world.\nThis year's Women's History Month theme is \"Celebrating Women Who Tell Our Stories,\" which aims to honor and recognize the contributions of women in various forms of media and storytelling. From print, radio, TV, stage, screen, blogs, podcasts and more, this year's celebration will pay tribute to the women who have made a significant impact in these fields.\nOne of the most significant aspects of Women's History Month is education. Educators use this time to teach students about important women throughout history who have fought for equality and justice and contemporary trailblazers who are making a difference today. Women's History Month is not just about celebrating famous figures but also about recognizing everyday heroes who make a difference in their communities.\nAs we celebrate Women's History Month this year, it is essential to remember that there is still work to be done toward achieving gender equality. But by highlighting modern-day trailblazers as well as historical figures, we can inspire future generations of girls and young women to dream big and believe that they, too, can change the world.\nThousands of women around the world protested against gender violence in honor of International Women's Day.\n-\nInternational Women's Day, March 8: This day celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. In addition to recognizing their accomplishments, it also serves as a platform to raise awareness about gender equality and advocate for women's rights worldwide.\n-\nHarriet Tubman Day, March 10: This day commemorates the life and legacy of Harriet Tubman. This African American abolitionist helped lead hundreds of enslaved people to freedom through the Underground Railroad.\n-\nEqual Pay Day, March 14: This day represents how far into a new year women must work to earn the same amount men earned the prior calendar year. It highlights the ongoing issue of the gender pay gap.\n-\nInternational Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, March 25: This day honors the millions of people enslaved during the transatlantic slave trade, many of whom were women.\nThis story was originally published by Tricia Goss on\nsimplemost.com.\nA trailblazing New York chef details her accomplishments in the cutthroat restaurant industry.\nNext time you use your windshield wipers, refrigerator or Wi-Fi, thank these women.\nWhy purple, green and white are the colors associated with Women’s History Month.\nThe record-breaking basketball star is a senior, but she could've played another year due to NCAA COVID-19 changes.\nThe NFLPA had players grade each club on various things like team food and locker room environment, and their relationships with coaches and owners.\nAlabama lawmakers pushed forward legislation to shield IVF clinics from lawsuits amid public pressure to resume services.",
