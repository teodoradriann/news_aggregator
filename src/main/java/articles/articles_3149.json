    "text": "Politics & Government\nStudent phone bans, charges for protesters among new KY laws taking effect\n- Kentucky lawmakers passed over 140 bills, prioritizing GOP-backed education laws.\n- New laws ban student smartphone use and criminalize online sexual extortion.\n- Bills defund college diversity programs and restrict Capitol protest activities.\nKentucky’s legislature didn’t take up a state budget during this year’s short, 30-day session that ended March 28, but the Republican-controlled House and Senate still advanced the party’s priorities.\nLawmakers passed more than 140 bills and filed hundreds more during their time in Frankfort. They run the gamut from defunding diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Kentucky’s colleges and universities, to a ban on students using smartphones at school and legislation to make “sextortion” a new crime.\nUnder Kentucky’s Constitution, new laws take effect 90 days after the legislature adjourns. Exceptions include bills that have special effective dates, general appropriation measures and those with emergency clauses, which make them effective immediately, according to the Legislation Research Commission.\nHere’s a look at a few of the many new laws soon going into effect:\nDiversity, equity and inclusion:\nHouse Bill 4, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Decker, prevents Kentucky colleges and universities from spending money ondiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. It includes offices, policies and practices “designed or implemented to promote or provide preferential treatment or benefits to individuals on the basis of religion, sex, color, or national origin.” The legislation overcame a veto from Gov. Andy Beshear and pushback from Democrats. TheUniversity of Kentuckydissolved its Office of Institutional Diversity last year under pressure from lawmakers andNorthern Kentucky University followedsuit. More recently, ahead of H.B. 4 going into effect, UK canceled graduation events for Black and LGBTQ students andpulled out of Lexington’s Pride Monthevent.\nLimits on teacher-student communications:\nSenate Bill 181requires teachers to communicate with students using traceable technology.Emails and texts are prohibited.Several incidents involving inappropriate sexual communications between school staff and students have led to criminal charges in recent years. A2022 Herald-Leader investigationfound of the 194 teachers who lost their licenses in some way over the previous five years, 61% were related to sexual misconduct. In sponsoring the bill, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor said its goal is to outline clear guidelines for electronic communications between school staff, volunteers and students to protect student safety.\nRestricting protests in Kentucky’s Capitol:\nHouse Bill 399creates a new criminal offense: “interference with a legislative proceeding.” The bill camein response to protestsagainst Senate Bill 150 in 2023. That bill outlawed most gender-affirming care for young people in Kentucky, and it drew loud protests that erupted in the capitol’s gallery. Protesters were removed and restrained with zip ties. The protest bill, sponsored by Rep. John Blanton, was passed largely on party lines, though some Republicans did join Democrats in voting against it. A third offense of first-degree interference is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.\nCriminal and civil penalties for “sextortion”: Sexual extortion is the extortion of money or sexual favors from someone by\nthreatening to reveal evidence of their sexual activity. It doesn’t require preexisting sexual images of the victim, as artificial intelligence can generate them. Scammers often target children and teenagers, including one recentGlasgow teen who took his own lifeafter he was targeted.Senate Bill 73, sponsored by Sen. Julie Raque Adams, creates a range of felony offenses for sexual extortion. There are stiffer penalties for people who target children, and those who are convicted of sexual extortion in Kentucky must register as sex offenders. Other parts of the law make it easier to sue perpetrators and require schools to educate students about it.\nA ban on student phone use during the school day: From California to Florida, school mobile phone bans are sweeping the country as states try to grapple with their\nnegative effects on students’ attention and mental health.Now, Kentucky has joined the pack with[House Bill 208](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/25rs/hb208.html). The bill requires school boards to, at a minimum, adopt policies that prohibit student phone use during the school day with a few limited exceptions. It was sponsored by Rep. Josh Bray.\nMoments of silence to start the school day: In another change students are likely to notice when schools start back,\n[Senate Bill 19](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/25rs/sb19.html)requires schools to create “moments of silence” at the start of each school day, lasting up to two minutes.[Students are invited to pray, meditate](https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/education/article300805279.html)or otherwise remain silent, but they cannot distract other students. Critics have raised First Amendment concerns of mandating religious activities in public schools and note students are already free to pray during the school day if they wish. Senate Bill 19 sponsor Sen. Rick Girdler has said the bill has no religious connotations.\n- Manufactured homes must be treated equally under zoning laws:\n[House Bill 160](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/25rs/hb160.html)bars local governments from adopting and enforcing zoning laws that treat manufactured homes differently than single-family homes. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Susan Witten as one way to[address Kentucky’s housing shortage.](https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article299384059.html)Some localities have experimented with similar ordinances to solve local housing shortages, and Kentucky as a whole needs more than 200,000 housing units. That number is expected to balloon to almost 300,000 units in the next few years.\nDo you have a question about Lexington or Kentucky for our service journalism team? We’d like to hear from you.

    "text": "Nesta semana, o governo da Rússia anunciou planos para iniciar a oferta gratuita de vacinas terapêuticas contra o câncer a partir de 2025. Rapidamente, o comunicado provocou uma onda de esperança nas redes sociais na luta contra a doença. Apesar disso, especialistas criticaram a falta de publicações científicas sobre o imunizante.\n+ Leia mais notícias de [Saúde](https://revistaoeste.com/saude) em Oeste\nSegundo a [Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS)](https://revistaoeste.com/tag/organizacao-mundial-da-saude-oms/), o câncer é responsável por cerca de 10 milhões de mortes a cada ano. No entanto, a ausência de publicações que comprovem a segurança e eficácia dessas vacinas geraram polêmica no mundo acadêmico.\nSegundo a agência de notícias estatal Tass, o diretor do Centro de Pesquisa Médica em Radiologia do Ministério da Saúde da Rússia, Andrey Kaprin, afirmou que o lançamento deve ocorrer no começo de 2025.\nVacina da Rússia usa técnica de RNA mensageiro\nAs vacinas em desenvolvimento utilizam a tecnologia de RNA mensageiro, semelhante àquela usada nos imunizantes contra a covid-19 da Pfizer/BioNTech e da Moderna. As farmacêuticas exploram a tecnologia para tratar tumores.\nNo fim do mês passado, a diretora da Agência Federal de Medicina e Biologia, Veronika Skvortsova, afirmou que os testes já duram quase três anos.\nLeia também: [“O cemitério das estrelas”](https://revistaoeste.com/revista/edicao-242/o-cemiterio-das-estrelas/), reportagem de Dagomir Marquezi publicada na Edição 242 da Revista Oeste\nPorém, a falta de informações sobre quais tipos de câncer a vacina tratará e se será oferecida como parte de testes clínicos ou como tratamento efetivo são motivo de desconfiança. A comunidade científica exige clareza nos processos e resultados e entende como crucial a transparência nos dados.\nCríticas sobre transparência\nMaria Ignez Braghiroli, oncologista e membro do Comitê de Tumores Gastrointestinais da Sociedade Brasileira de Oncologia Clínica, destacou a importância de entender como o procedimento se realizará. Já a infectologista Luana Araújo expressou ceticismo, pois, para ela, “anúncios científicos devem ser acompanhados de transparência e publicação de dados”.\nO desenvolvimento de novos medicamentos passa por várias etapas de estudos rigorosos antes que as agências reguladoras aprovem sua comercialização. O ministro da Saúde da Rússia, Mikhail Murashko, indicou que os testes pré-clínicos com animais deveriam terminar este ano, com testes clínicos previstos para começar em breve.\nOs testes\nQuando a criação da vacina teve anúncio em abril, Skvortsova mencionou que os testes tinham como foco o câncer colorretal, melanomas e glioblastomas. O desenvolvimento envolve colaboração entre o Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Epidemiologia e Microbiologia Gamaleya, o Instituto de Pesquisa Oncológica Hertsen de Moscou e o Centro de Pesquisa do Câncer Blokhin.\nAlexander Gintsburg, diretor do Centro Gamaleya, afirmou que os ensaios pré-clínicos mostraram que a vacina pode suprimir o desenvolvimento de tumores e metástases. O imunizante ainda reduziria significativamente os tumores de animais. Apesar das falas de Gintsburg, não há registros de dados oficiais.",

    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — After experiencing homelessness for two years, Gideon Nieman laid eyes on his future home. “I just enjoy that feeling of people not looking at me anymore and thinking, ‘Oh, he's homeless,’” he said. “It's going to be a beacon. People will see what we do, and I hope that it will encourage them to make the change, to want to better their life and get themselves off the street, into a better position.” On Thursday, The Other Side Village installed its first tiny home in a lot off of Redwood Road on Salt Lake City’s west side. “This is the foundation of what will become a larger community for individuals who've experienced chronic homelessness,” said Preston Cochrane, CEO of The Other Side Village. A handful of future residents will move in before the end of the year, he said. “This just represents transformation and hope,” said Cochrane. “It gives them a safe, beautiful place to rebuild their lives and reclaim their future.” Once the village is finished, more than 500 people will be living there. The Other Side Village is not a housing project, but a community, said Joseph Grenny, Co-Founder and Board Chairman. “We're offering to bring resources and assets,” he said. “This will lift the community. We'll be bringing a performance hall and stores and services that don't exist on the west side right now, and we expect to be one of the favored neighbors of the entire area.” Getting into permanent housing makes Nieman confident that he will never live on the streets again, he said. “I told myself, ‘One and done,’ and the village is it,” said Nieman. “I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be great.”",

    "text": "Sargodha, May 25 : An angry mob seriously injured a Christian man and set his house on fire over an alleged incident of blasphemy in Pakistan's Sargodha on Saturday. Local sources revealed that the situation turned violent when an enraged mob entered Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, an area which houses many Christian families, broke into a Christian man's house, thrashed him badly and set his belongings on fire. The mob also torched a shoe factory operating from within the premises besides damaging the entire property. Videos of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed a badly injured man lying on the ground as several people continued to attack him, many using even stones. The local police, however, said that the situation was brought under control after it dispersed the angry mob and shifted the injured to a nearby hospital. Police authorities also maintained that they had dispersed the crowd and rescued at least two more families from being attacked by the Muslim mob. \"We have shifted the injured to a hospital and also taken into custody several suspects involved in the incident,\" said Regional Police Officer (RPO) Shariq Kamal. \"The incident occurred over an incident of alleged desecration,\" confirmed Sargodha District Police Officer (DPO) Asad Ejaz Malhi. \"When a heavy contingent of police reached the spot, we saw a huge crowd outside some houses. We cleared the area and took out the families safely,\" added Ejaz. While the police officials claimed that no one was injured, social media posts on the incident confirmed torture and vandalism caused by the violent mob. \"We have called in a District Peace Committee to evaluate the situation and issue a statement on the matter. District committee includes district administration, religious scholars of Muslim and minority communities,\" said the DPO. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed serious concerns about the unfolding situation in Sargodha, stating, \"Christian community in Gillwala is reportedly at grave risk to their lives at the hands of charged mobs.\" The incident has brought back horrific memories of last August when angry mobs attacked Christian churches, and Christian graveyards and rampaged the Christian neighbourhood torching dozens of houses over alleged blasphemy committed by members of the community in Jaranwala. The human rights lawyers have slammed the Pakistani government for failing to take any serious and sincere action against the perpetrators of the Jaranwala incident and emboldening radicals. \"I strongly condemn the Sardogha incident. I denounce the failure of the State to take any serious and sincere action against the perpetrators of the Jaranwala incident. It has only emboldened those who exploit religious sentiments for their criminal acts,\" said politician and human rights lawyer Jibran Nasir.",

    "title": "4 Reasons IonQ Stock Could Make You Money in 2024 The Motley Fool",
    "text": "You've probably heard the old saying that lightning never strikes the same place twice. Investors interpret this idea to mean that a stock will not experience wild growth for two consecutive years. The thing is that lightning can really shine and does Hit the same spot twice. Tall trees and skyscrapers are often targets. And in the same sense, a hot ticker can record two big, back-to-back annual profits. You just have to find the right stock! Although its shares gained 280% IonQ (IONQ -6.35%) While 2023 will certainly be a tough act to follow, there's no reason to believe 2024 can't be another bullish year. In fact, there are four specific reasons why the coming year could be another winning year for IonQ stock. in no particular order… 1. The world is starting to see the potential of quantum computing Most investors have probably heard the term “quantum computing.” However, it would be no exaggeration to say that most investors don't really know what it is or why they should care; The leading players in the budding business have not made it at all easy for the average person to understand. However, this is the year that could change investors' perspective towards companies in business. Furthering this understanding will be the practical use of quantum computers in powering technologies that investors are more familiar with, such as artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly generative AI. And as it turns out, IonQ is setting up shop in this corner of the artificial intelligence market. In August, the company announced an agreement with Zapata AI to “unleash new potential benefits of quantum computing that can help solve complex real-world business problems,” building on its already created generative Expanding on AI partnerships. It remains to be seen what any final product of this collaboration will be or look like, but the companies are looking to solve real business problems. It is practical, tangible projects like this that will make IonQ's technology real and practical for interested investors. 2. The technical advantages of IonQ will be highlighted The mainstreaming and better understanding of quantum computing is likely to have another beneficial impact on IonQ stock. That is, they will highlight the fact that IonQ is years ahead of many of its peers in terms of practical application with its simple quantum-computing solution. In layman's terms, quantum computers use subatomic particles such as ions, photons or electrons to handle calculations instead of the metal or silicon circuits used in most modern computers. Thus quantum computers are infinitely faster than conventional computers. However, there exists more than one type of subatomic particle suitable to serve as the basis of a quantum computer. IonQ's trapped-ion approach is one of the easiest methods to utilize and commercialize. And that's exactly what the company is doing. This is in contrast to most other organizations developing quantum-computing platforms. Take Alphabetof (GOOG -0.25%) (GOOGL -0.39%) Google and IBM (IBM -0.12%) as an example. Both plan to introduce utility-scale quantum-computing solutions by 2030, with IBM set to unveil a less powerful quantum-computing platform sometime earlier. The superconducting-based qubits on which these systems are built are difficult and expensive to use. The same can be said for Microsoft(MSFT 0.20%) Quantum-computing efforts that rely on relatively rare Marjorana particles. These alternatives could ultimately provide more computing power than IonQ's trapped-ion technology, and solve problems with greater accuracy. But the technology is years away from being ready for widespread commercial use. IonQ is building a working, commercialized, trapped-ion quantum computer Now! Which are much more powerful. The fact that the company reported revenue of $6.1 million last quarter and generated an additional $26.3 million during the same three months confirms that enterprises and institutions are ready for high-end computing solutions, even if they Be lower than the state. -The art solution a decade from now. 3. Moving toward a major milestone vision Speaking of technology, as IonQ continues to refine its trapped-ion quantum-computing system, the company expects another big leap forward in 2024, setting the stage for a technological “quantum leap” in 2025 . But first things first. Investors with their finger on the pulse of quantum computing have probably heard the term algorithmic qubit, or AQ for short. It is a measure of the number of subatomic particles within a functioning quantum-computing system at any time. In more basic terms, it is a measure of computing power or speed. IonQ's most powerful quantum-computing platform – Forte – boasts an #AQ number of 29, although the company hopes to produce systems reaching an #AQ figure of 35 in 2024. However, something is likely to happen next year that could prove to be game-changing. In 2025, IonQ believes it will be able to offer a quantum-computing platform with an #AQ score of 64. This is not a small milestone. As IonQ's third quarter earnings release explains, “The company believes that in reaching this #AQ milestone, its systems will provide quantum advantage for certain use cases and that classical computers can now use IonQ systems will not be able to fully simulate.” Reaching an #AQ of 35 is likely to draw attention to the fact that a #AQ score of 64 is within reach. 4. Mergers and acquisitions are in progress Last but not least, 2024 could be another good year for IonQ stock as the tech giant and other quantum-computing start-ups are clearly looking for ways to better position themselves to capitalize on a huge opportunity. Have been. This is not a prediction that IonQ will be acquired (which, by the way, is a lousy sole basis for owning a stock). But IonQ doesn't need to find a buyer to enter the market or benefit from the widespread rush to grow. Demand for intellectual property from other developers alone could be enough to push IonQ shares to an even more premium valuation. This is not a prediction that is pulled out of a hat. Gernot Berger, senior manager (and physicist) at VC HTGF, a German investment management organization, believes that big tech companies will “consolidate their position in the quantum-computing field this year through strategic alliances, collaborations and, above all, , will explore potential acquisitions”. Quantum Insider's Matt Swain predicts a wave of dealmaking this year, as “research results have been promising, which is likely to attract larger companies sitting on the sidelines.” IonQ CEO Peter Chapman expects the quantum-computing industry's next year will resemble last year's race to buy and/or build conversational AI solutions once ChatGPT is made available to the public. Whatever is in the cards in this regard, it should create a tailwind for IonQ stock. Respect the risk, but don't ignore the potential Another guaranteed mega-profit from IonQ shares in 2024? No, there are no guarantees when it comes to stock picking… even if the story is as compelling as this company's. While awareness and understanding of quantum computing is beginning to increase, institutional funding of these companies and quantum-computing projects is decreasing, with financial backers becoming more selective about the projects they want to acquire. Practical revenue potential is now becoming a factor behind funding. As Quantum Insider's Sven writes, quantum start-ups and/or their stocks are “really, really expensive.” This is certainly a handicap, compounded by the fact that IonQ remains in the red. However, it's a dynamic that arguably plays into the hand that IonQ is holding, rather than working against it. The company already has practical, concrete solutions to sell in a market that is beginning to recognize the potential of quantum computing; Generative AI is a particularly exciting opportunity right now. Thus, analysts believe IonQ will post top-line growth of around 80% in 2024, followed by potential revenue growth of around 95% in 2023. This is an above average risk, to be sure, and the stock will almost certainly continue to have above average volatility. If you can stomach both, this year could be another winning period for IonQ stock. Source: www.fool.com",
