El malaguismo ha respondido, y la hinchada txuri urdin, también. Es por eso que hemos podido disfrutar de un gran ambiente en la previa del encuentro. Los aledaños de La Rosaleda eran una marea blanquiazul en la que apenas se podía distinguir quién era de cada equipo. Hinchas de ambos conjuntos compartían bebidas, risas e ilusiones en la previa del encuentro. Y en ElDesmarque no hemos querido perdernos la ocasión de salir a la calle y preguntarles a los aficionados cómo vivían este partido. Y lo cierto es que todo ha sido buen rollo y risas. En la afición visitante han agradecido mucho la hospitalidad de la ciudad de Málaga y del malaguismo, y haciendo gala del señorío que caracteriza a la hinchada txuri urdin, han dedicado sus mejores deseos para el club de Martiricos. Eso sí, después de este partido. Una aficionada llevaba la camiseta del Málaga bajo la de la Real Una aficionada de Donostia nos sorprendía contándonos que esta era la sexta vez que viajaba en lo que iba de año. Entendemos el lapsus, muchos de nosotros aún seguimos equivocándonos al poner '2024' en un papel. En cualquier caso, queda claro el amor de esta hincha por la Costa del Sol, tan acogedora, pero a la vez tan diferente a la playa de La Concha. Además, nos mostró que, bajo su casaca de la Real Sociedad, llevaba una camiseta del Málaga. Apostamos a que el resultado le da igual. También nos ha sorprendido una pareja de señores, ataviados hasta las cejas de elementos del equipo txuri urdin. El deseo de estos dos aficionados ha sido claro: \"Que gane la Real Sociedad 1-3 y el Málaga que suba a Primera, que es lo que hace falta\", aseveró uno de los dos. No hay duda de que entre la afición txuri urdin se guarda buen recuerdo del cuadro malaguista desde sus últimos enfrentamientos en LALIGA EA Sports. Ambientes como estos son los que nos gustan, e independientemente del resultado del partido, que reine la concordia, la fiesta y el buen rollo.",

    "text": "Union Demands Tech Giant Respond to Sen. Murphy, Congressional Inquiry\nWASHINGTON , June 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Teamsters are joining Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and a bipartisan coalition of over 30 Senators in demanding that Amazon cooperate with a congressional inquiry requesting information on its exploitative Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program.\nThe lawmakers made the demand in a recent letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy , after the company sent a dishonest response to an earlier Senate oversight letter calling on Amazon to divulge whether its mistreatment and micromanagement of DSPs is compliant with federal labor law.\n\" Andy Jassy and Jeff Bezos think they can lie to the American people and break the law without consequences,\" said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien . \"This company is making billions off the backs of the hardworking men and women that drive Amazon vans, wear Amazon vests, and deliver Amazon packages, yet Amazon executives still have the audacity to turn around and deny that they're Amazon employees. No company should be above the law, period. The Teamsters continue to support Senate efforts that hold this corporate bully accountable for its dishonesty and mistreatment of its workers.\"\nSen. Murphy noted that Amazon's response to the earlier Senate oversight letter \"included multiple self-contradictory statements, general assertions without factual support instead of the information requested and claims at odds with publicly available data and highly credible investigative journalism.\"\n\"Amazon's letter to the U.S. Senate is full of lies,\" said DSP Driver Jessie Moreno, who joined his co-workers in organizing with Teamsters Local 396. \"Amazon is claiming that it doesn't control its drivers, but we all know that's not true. Amazon needs to take responsibility for our safety and well-being while we are delivering their packages. Amazon drivers and warehouse workers are standing together to demand the good jobs we deserve.\"\nLast month, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy broke federal labor laws by making anti-union threats.\nThe Senators gave Jassy until July 5 to respond to their latest letter.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada , and Puerto Rico .

THIS IS STILL I KNOW IT’S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I’VE BEEN AT IT, BUT IT STILL FEELS LIKE NEW AND IT STILL FEELS EXCITING. SO I JUST TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME, AND EACH RACE IS LIKE A NEW CHALLENGE, AND I JUST WANT TO BE THE BEST THAT I CAN BE. THE 29 YEAR OLD IS RUNNING HER FOURTH STRAIGHT BOSTON TEN MARATHONS OVERALL. COME ON, JACK TO THE LINE. TO THE LINE. ROUTE 18 IS THE TRACK COACH AT HER ALMA MATER, CONCORD CHRISTIAN ACADEMY. AS AN ELITE RUNNER, SHE’S SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD. IT’S INTIMIDATING TO BE HONEST, AND SO IT’S LIKE A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY LEARN FROM THEM AND JUST LIKE, RESPECT THEM.
