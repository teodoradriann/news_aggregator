    "title": "Is this village near Mumbai an Islamic State 'liberated zone'? | Mumbai News - Times of India",
    "text": "Barely 60 kilometres from Mumbai lie the villages of Borivali and Padgha. Surrounded by the slopes of Mahuli Hills, this quaint locality in Bhiwandi taluka in Thane district has for long earned notoriety for being an alleged terror hotbed. And a recent crackdown by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took it a notch higher.In the early hours of December 9, the NIA busted a ‘terror network’ in Borivali-Padgha. The federal counter-terror agency arrested 15 people for their alleged links with the proscribed Islamic State (also known as Isis).The crackdown was part of simultaneous operations conducted in 44 locations across Maharashtra and neighbouring Karnataka.“NIA investigations have revealed that the accused, all members of Isis Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali, where they had hatched a conspiracy to spread terror and violence across India,” the agency said in a statement.“The arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone’. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence for strengthening the Padgha base,” the statement read.But this is not the first time that the village has seen such a crackdown. Almost two decades ago, some of its residents were accused of indulging in terrorist acts as well. medium106348945A blast from the pastFive residents of the Muslim-dominated village were convicted in the 2002-03 Mumbai serial blasts case. The key accused, Saquib Nachan, is one of the 15 people arrested during the December 9 raids. He has been named as the kingpin and head of the Islamic State module in Maharashtra. In August this year, Saquib’s son Shamil was arrested in connection with the Isis sleeper cell that was busted by the police in Pune.Saquib has been booked in over a dozen terror cases and convicted twice. In 1997, he was convicted by the Supreme Court for planning terror attacks in India, along with Khalistani terrorists. He was convicted again in 2016 by a Mumbai court under the Arms Act. He served both the sentences and was released in 2017. medium106349118A ‘liberated zone’ The Islamic State and its various offshoots are banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, or the UAPA. According to the US’ Director of National Intelligence, Islamic State is a Salafi-jihadist group that has conducted and inspired terrorist attacks worldwide, resulting in thousands killed or injured.Voice of Hind, a propaganda magazine suspected to be published by the Islamic State a few years ago, appealed to Indian Muslims to “wake up” and fight against the alleged oppression and atrocities meted out to the community.In its statement, the NIA claimed to have recovered a pistol, two air-guns, eight swords or knives, more than ₹68 lakh in cash, 51 Hamas flags, incriminating documents, smartphones and other digital devices, during the raids on December 9.The agency also said that the arrested men, who are in police custody, had self-declared the village of Padgha as a ‘liberated zone’ and as ‘Al Sham’ (an Arabic word used for Levant or greater Syria). They had allegedly motivated impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha for strengthening the Islamic State's base.The prime accused in the Padgha case, Saquib Nachan, used to administer a 'bayath' (oath of allegiance to the Khalifa of Islamic State) to the persons joining the proscribed organisation, the NIA claimed.Locals, however, deny any such attempts to declare Padgha as a “liberated territory” or asking Muslims to relocate to the area. “Most of the people in the village have been here for generations. We all know each other, people who have relocated are the ones who have found work in the nearby warehouses,” a local says speaking on condition of anonymity.He stresses that the Padgha gram panchayat and all other government offices in the area still retain their names, “Where is the question of declaring the village as ‘Al-Sham’?” he asked. 106351657Other side of the storyVillagers tell TOI+ that police and NIA are telling just one side of the story. They say Padgha finds mention in India’s history for its contribution to the freedom struggle. Village women had then stepped out of their houses during the Swadeshi movement and set afire British goods in Borivali. “That part of the history has been conveniently forgotten,” says another local. Families and friends of the arrested men says that none of them were involved in any illegal activities, let alone terrorism. They also express concerns over the manner in which the village was being linked to terrorist acts repeatedly.The villagers have now appointed a common lawyer to fight their case although it is not clear as to what charges the NIA has pressed against the 15 accused.“Padgha has been given a bad name because of one family, but that doesn’t mean the entire village has criminals. We have had instances of job letters being cancelled when the employer came to know that the person lives in Padgha. Many of our young boys are also struggling to find a match [for marriage]. Why should they be punished?” sayss Ravish Khot, a small-time realtor.“My son [26-year-old Yahya Khot] got married last year and his wife is expecting. Like in most houses of the village that were raided, nothing was found from our house too,” says Khot, who suffered a heart attack at the time of the raid and had to be rushed to a hospital in Bhiwandi. “Besides the men who have been arrested, the NIA officers are calling other people, as young as 14-15 year old, for questioning. Is that even fair?” asks Khot. Families cry foulSitting inside her partially dilapidated house, Rameeza Nachan (not related to Saquib Nachan) says she hasn't seen her two sons – Rafil (21) and Razil (22) since the day they were arrested by the NIA. “I was in Ajmer for a pilgrimage when the raids happened; both my boys were in the house at the time. Had I known this would happen, I would have never left them alone,” says Rameeza.“When I came home, the entire house was in a mess. I still don't know what the central agencies found in my house and arrested my children in such a serious case,” Rameeza wonders. 106349355Her two sons have been the only breadwinners for the family since her husband’s death five months ago. They used to drive a shared taxi on the Padgha-Bhiwandi route to feed the family. “We were waiting for Razil to finish his graduation so that he can look for a good job and earn better. But after this [the raid and arrest by NIA], we don't know what is in store for all of us. I don't even have money to pay for a lawyer,” she says. Claiming that her family has been living in Padgha for several decades now, Rameeza says the entire locality can vouch for the innocence of her family members. She has filed an application in the court, pleading that Razil be allowed to appear for his exam which he had missed due to his father’s death. Abubakar Kunnathpeedikal, father of another accused Munzir Kunnathpeedikal (37), says his son is a hardware engineer and runs his own internet and CCTV camera business. Munzir is married and has three children.“Officers started banging the door in the middle of the night. When I opened the door, they barged in and asked for Munzir. I woke him up and they said they had a search warrant. After searching the house, they took Munzir with them,\\\" says Abubakar. He shows TOI+ a document in which the officers had written that no item was seized from their house. “My son doesn’t even have an NC (non-cognisable offence) registered against him. Our family has nothing to do with the charges the police have levelled. In fact, Munzir worked on installing the internet line at the Padgha police station and the officers there knew him very well,” says Abubakar.",

    "title": "80% of pregnant-related deaths in Missouri were preventable, report finds",
    "text": "Missouri (KHQA) — \"We hope that individuals look at the recommendations and they can see themselves in some of those and try to work within their respective communities to put these actions into place because one death is too many,\" said Ashlie Otto, a registered nurse for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS).\nThe Missouri DHSS released their 2018-2022 Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review. They recorded any death of a pregnant Missouri resident, from the pregnancy to a year postpartum. They categorize them into pregnancy-associated (where the death had nothing to do with the pregnancy, like a car accident) and pregnancy-related (when the death was the direct result of or caused by chain of events from the pregnancy).\nThese pregnancy-related deaths are decreasing, but the leading causes are still a cautionary tale for soon-to-be mothers.\nThis means that if at least one piece of effort or intervention had been applied in the specific situation, the pregnant woman would still be alive.\nOtto hopes that these reports lead to further studies and increase public education on the issues women face during and after pregnancy, which will prevent more deaths in the future.\nOtto said this is likely due to a number of factors, such as distrust in medical care, systemic issues, and environmental/community factors.\nBlack women are also more likely to be victims of homicide during or after pregnancy—six of the deaths in the report were black women that were murdered directly because of their pregnancy.\nThis is also why, in the report, the DHSS urges local and state governments to invest in urban infrastructure and violence intervention programs: to \"increase avenues for fostering healthy interpersonal and family relationships with a goal of reducing violence and improving maternal health,\" according to the report. Creating a safer community for pregnant women, and, in turn, everyone else.\n\"Looking at the health of moms and babies, that directly correlates with the health of your community and state,\" said Otto.\nThe leading cause of pregnancy-related death is mental health issues.\n\"Statewide we see a lack of mental health resources,\" said Otto.\n51% is due to postpartum depression and anxiety, while 41% is due to a substance use disorder.\n\"There's a large focus on moms when they're pregnant, you know, they're going to the doctor often. People tend to, for lack of better words, dote on them more...Once that baby is born, it's like 'eh, you know, moms got this,'\" said Otto.\nBut mom maybe doesn't 'got this,' and that's okay.\n\"We know that maternal mental health is stigmatized and that the more we talk about it, the more we normalize that if you're feeling this way, it's okay to speak up, it's okay to get help. It doesn't mean you're less of a mother,\" said Otto.\nOtto also encourages healthcare providers, family, friends, and basically anyone that comes in contact with someone who has just given birth, to check in with them.\n\"Talk to them, just have a brief conversation with them about how their feeling. And sometimes mom don't necessarily say 'I'm struggling.' So sometimes what you can do is ask: 'How are you sleeping? Are you able to get at least two nutritional meals a day and some snacks in between? Do you feel overwhelmed?' Sometimes they'll be more comfortable answering questions like that, that can really help you figure out if that individual might need extra attention,\" said Otto.\nBasically, while moms are looking after the baby, someone needs to be looking out for the moms.\nThe second leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in cardiovascular disease.\n\"A lot of people think that women during their child-bearing years, you're fairly young, it tends to be the healthiest time in your life. And most people don't stop to think about high blood pressure during your pregnancy, or even if you have slightly higher blood pressure before you get pregnant, how that can negatively impact your health,\" said Otto.\nShe also said that if you experience high blood pressure for the first time while pregnant, to work with your health care provider on how to manage that during the pregnancy, but also afterwards— to make sure it is going back down to normal at a healthy pace.\nThe third leading cause was infection from COVID-19, sepsis, pneumonia.\nAnd then there's the rare and life-threatening amniotic fluid embolism: a condition where amniotic fluid enters the bloodstream. Otto said that while there was an increase, they don't have enough data yet to understand why its increasing, or if it even is a trend that will continue to increase.\nThe 15-page report is more user friendly than the past years, so that the everyday person can learn from it and make \"sure we're educating mom and the family unit,\" said Otto.\nThere's also a dashboard with interactive graphs.\nThe end of the report lists several recommendations for local communities, healthcare facilities, insurance companies, and state governments to further protect the life of a pregnant mother.\nThe report recommends for Missouri to continue extending Medicaid coverage to one year postpartum for all conditions.\nBut Medicaid cuts are looming as the US Senate passed the \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" and is now on the House of Representatives floor for debate. This could mean more health risks for pregnant women, and possibly more deaths.\n\"We see that we have higher rates of maternal mortality in states that have not expanded Medicaid...Medicaid and Medicaid expansion often are a primary source of care of women who are of reproductive age,\" said Sophia Tripoli, the Senior Director of Policy at Families USA, a non-profit that pushes to protect Medicaid.\nThere's still a bit of ways to go, but overall, the report is supposed to help educate the public, push for better support for pregnant women, and give women a place to start when learning how and what to ask for help for.",

    "text": "Microsoft has confirmed that a new bug in Windows 11 24H2 is automatically increasing the audio volume level to 100%.\nAccording to a recently updated support document quietly published this week, the issue reportedly occurs on Windows 11, version 24H2 gaming PCs using an external USB digital audio converter (DAC) sound system.\nMore specifically, users may experience 100-level audio issues when any of the following criteria are met:\nYou use the Creative Sound BlasterX G6 USB digital audio converter (DAC). Your gaming system runs Windows 11, version 24H2. You manually make your gaming system go to sleep and then you manually wake the system from sleep. You attach and then immediately detach the external sound system from your Windows gaming system. You adjust the volume of the external sound system and then immediately detach the external sound system from your Windows gaming system. Microsoft adds that the only noticeable indicator is the sudden increase in audio volume to 100 percent, with no error messages or other identifying indicators.\nThe Redmond giant says the issue is caused by a “timing problem” in the AudioEndpointBuilder service, a Windows service introduced in Windows Vista that discovers new audio devices, creates software audio endpoints, and activates them.\nCurrently, there is no fix available for the audio issue.\nMicrosoft is working on a resolution and is expected to provide more information when available.",

By Emilio Abad\nJanuary 16, 2025 04:08PM EDT\nJanuary 16, 2025 04:08PM EDT\n© JASON MILLER Bronny James #9 and LeBron James #23 of the Los Angeles Lakers warms up prior to the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers Bronny James has faced intense scrutiny simply for being the son of one of the greatest basketball players of all time, LeBron James . The immense expectations surrounding his performance and future in the NBA have left him open to widespread criticism from fans and the public. Addressing this, LeBron made it clear that it’s unfair to attack his son for simply pursuing his passion .\nLeBron shared his thoughts on the New Heights Podcast with Jason and Travis Kelce, where he discussed Bronny’s transition to the NBA and responded to the criticism . He emphasized that Bronny doesn’t need to play basketball for financial reasons and expressed his pride in his son’s efforts.\n“ Bronny doesn’t have to play basketball at all. It’s not like he needs the money ,” LeBron stated. “He can do whatever he wants to do. If he wants to be the CEO of my company, he can be that. I’ll start teaching him to be that . But he’s like, ‘This is my career, this is my goal, and this is my aspiration. And I want to play ball.’ I love that kid. He’s awesome .”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Bronny James and financial independence LeBron’s remarks highlight that Bronny is not playing for financial security but rather out of passion for the game. LeBron himself is one of the wealthiest NBA players of all time, boasting a staggering net worth of $1.2 billion and earning $48 million this season alone .\nBronny James #9 of the Los Angeles Lakers signals to a teammate during the fourth quarter against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on October 30, 2024 in Cleveland, Ohio. The Cavaliers defeated the Lakers 134-110.\nAdvertisement Bronny also has significant income streams independent of his father. While his guaranteed NBA contract runs through 2028 for $7.98 million , his off-court earnings make him a wealthy young athlete. He entered the collegiate level with a $5.9 million NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) valuation , which dropped to $3.2 million after his cardiac arrest and some less-than-stellar performances. However, lucrative endorsement deals with brands like Beats by Dre, Nike, and PSD Underwear have ensured that Bronny remains financially secure.\nAdvertisement see also\nLeBron James admits he's rooting for success for an NBA team, but it's not the Los Angeles Lakers\nBronny’s on-court performance Despite facing challenges, Bronny has shown flashes of brilliance. He is currently averaging 19.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 2.0 steals, and 0.0 blocks per game, with shooting splits of 41.9% from the field, 46.2% from three, and 75.0% from the free-throw line . While he hasn’t played in recent G-League games, his strong performances earlier in the season have kept expectations high for his potential to develop into one of the NBA ’s top players.\nAdvertisement For now, Bronny James continues to work toward building his own legacy , driven not by external pressure or financial need, but by his love for the game and his determination to improve .\nEmilio Abad is a bilingual Journalism student in his final year at Universidad de Especialidad Espíritu Santo, with an external certification in Sports Journalism.
