    "text": "Postal worker drives nearly 400 miles on off day to deliver WWII letters to family, reports say (Gray News) - A postal worker reportedly went hundreds of miles off his route to make a special delivery. People reports Grand Prairie United States Postal Service carrier Alvin Gauthier helped a family reunite with World War II-era letters sent from their loved one who was serving in the Army. Gauthier shared he knew the importance of the letters when he came across them in his work bag. “I was getting ready for my route and found some letters that were dated back to 1942,” KXAS quoted Gauthier. “My main thought was I have to find this family.” However, the letters offered few details other than being addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lamb who lived in Jacksonville, Arkansas. KARK reported that Gauthier contacted its news team for assistance, and they were able to find Jo Ann Smith whose brother was Marion Lamb, the soldier who wrote the letters addressed to their parents. Gauthier shared he decided to take a road trip from Texas to Arkansas on his day off to deliver the letters. “Sometimes you have to go above and beyond,” KXAS quoted Gauthier. Gauthier, a Marine Corps veteran himself, arrived at Smith’s door with the letters after about a reported 5.5-hour drive. Smith thanked Gauthier for going above and beyond in delivering the letters. She said they are a reminder of the sacrifices her brother made. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "‘My soul is this place’: The inspiring story behind Puyallup’s educator of the year Jan 7, 2024, 12:36 PM (Photo from KIRO 7) Angela Arteaga spends her days with some of the Puyallup School District’s littlest learners. “It is such a blessing, I love it,” says Arteaga. To her kindergarten and first-grade students, she’s Miss Angela. “I always tell them, don’t stop learning. Learning is fun. And learning is for everybody,” says Arteaga. Originally from Colombia, she and her family moved to Puyallup in 2011. English was their second language; a language her young son struggled with at school. “One day he came and said, ‘Mom, nobody understands what I’m saying,’” recalls Arteaga. “And of course I came to tears too.” “I didn’t know how to help him with the most simple homework,” she added. So she began to volunteer at his elementary school, coming to class with her son every day. She was helping him learn and learning herself, too. “As a 33, 35, 36-year-old lady learning the days of the week, months of the year in English through kindergarten songs, it was beautiful,” says Arteaga. The more she learned, the more she loved being in the classroom. And so, she continued to volunteer until 2022, when she earned her teaching degree. She then returned to a first-grade classroom in Puyallup’s Kessler Center. Now, she has students of her own. “I have so much passion for this,” says Arteaga. Others have recognized that passion, nominating her for the Puyallup School District’s Elementary Educator of the Year, which she won! Arteaga tells KIRO 7 that the district has helped change her life. “I feel so grateful and thankful that I have been able to show my passion, my soul is this place,” she reflected.",

    "text": "2023-12-29 01:17:28 Arsenal FC has a bad start to the game against London city rivals West Ham. The first goal conceded is reviewed for a long time and brings back memories. London. Without the suspended German international Kai Havertz, Arsenal FC missed out on returning to the top of the Premier League table. The Gunners lost 0-2 (0-1) to their London rivals West Ham United in the English football league – Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool FC, who had already won at Burnley FC on Tuesday, remain leaders. Tomas Soucek (13th) scored for the guests in the early stages. The goal was checked for a long time by the video assistant because it was not clear whether the ball was out of bounds when Jarrod Bowen was assisted, but the goal counted. The scene at the goal line was somewhat reminiscent of Japan’s 2-1 goal against Spain at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which ultimately contributed to the German national team’s elimination. Saka and Rice miss opportunities to equalize Arsenal then had chances to equalize, such as Bukayo Saka’s header, which West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola defused (30′). Shortly before the break, Saka only hit the post (42nd). Declan Rice’s shot went just over the goal (53′). The next goal was scored by West Ham’s former Stuttgart player Konstantinos Mavropanos (55th), who also once played for Arsenal. The 26-year-old headed home from a corner. Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya saved a penalty from Saïd Benrahma shortly before the end (90+6). Havertz had seen his fifth yellow card in the top game on Saturday in Liverpool (1-1) and therefore had to watch.
