Stimulants are generally well tolerated by children and adults but some people may have negative effects, including jitteriness, headaches or an increased heart rate.\nThere are a number of different stimulant medications available, including methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine (Dexamphetamine) as well as atomoxetine (Strattera) and modafinil (Provigil).
