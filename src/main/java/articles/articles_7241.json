    "text": "Samsung nur auf Platz 10: Das ist das schnellste Android-Smartphone der Welt\nSamsung fällt im Leistungsvergleich der Smartphones im Juli zurück: Die Analysen einer Plattform offenbaren deutlich leistungsfähigere Konkurrenten.\nFrankfurt/Peking – Im aktuellsten Leistungsvergleich der schnellsten Android-Smartphones schneidet Samsung nicht gut ab. Ein Gaming-Handy führt die Rangliste der Plattform AnTuTu hingegen an. Das geht aus Juli-Daten des Anbieters, der den chinesischen Markt monatlich analysiert, hervor. Dabei fokussiert dieser sich auf Smartphones mit dem Betriebssystem Android.\nWie eingangs erwähnt sicherte sich das Red Magic 10S Pro+, ein Smartphone, das laut chip.de in Gamingkreisen beliebt ist, den ersten Platz im AnTuTu-Ranking in China. Den zweiten Platz erhielt das Vivo X200 Ulta. Das erste Samsung-Smartphone rangiert hingegen erst auf Platz 10 der aktuellsten Version des Rankings.\nIm Vergleich: Das sind die schnellsten Android-Smartphones\nDas gesamte Ranking im kompakten Überblick:\nPlatzierung | Gerät |\n---|---|\n1 | Red Magic 10 Pro |\n2 | iQOO 13 |\n3 | vivo X200 Ultra |\n4 | OnePlus 13 |\n5 | Poco F7 Ultra |\n6 | Mi 15 Ultra |\n7 | vivo X200 Pro |\n8 | Mi 15 |\n9 | vivo X200 Pro mini |\n10 | Galaxy S25 Ultra |\nQuelle: antutu.com |\nBeim angesprochenen Samsung-Gerät handelt es sich um das Galaxy S25 Ultra. Laut Angaben von Jörn Schmidt, der regelmäßig auf seinem Blog schmidtisblog.de über die Thematik berichtet, brachte die Juli-Bewertung des Anbieters allerdings kaum Veränderungen auf den Spitzenplätzen – bereits zum dritten Mal in Folge. Demnach könnte jedoch im Herbst 2025 Bewegung in den Markt kommen, da neue Prozessoren der Anbieter MediaTek und Qualcomm erwartet werden. Diese könnten maßgebliche Auswirkungen beim Thema Schnelligkeit der Geräte haben.\nÜber die Plattform\nAnTuTu (chinesisch: 安兔兔) ist laut eigenen Angaben eine weit verbreitete Benchmark-Software zur Leistungsmessung von Smartphones und anderen Geräten. Die Plattform wurde im Januar 2011 als Android-Benchmark-Anwendung gestartet.\nDie Rangliste des Anbieters basiert auf Durchschnittswerten von Benchmarks, die wiederum nützliche Nutzerstatistiken mit mindestens 1000 gültigen Ergebnissen im jeweiligen Monaten abbilden – im aktuellen Fall aus dem Juli 2025.\nInwiefern die Ergebnisse des Rankings zum chinesischen Markt auf den deutschen Markt übertragbar sind, muss allerdings kritisch hinterfragt werden.\nTipps und Tricks: Wird Ihr Android-Smartphone langsamer?\nMit der Nutzungszeit nimmt die Geschwindigkeit vieler Smartphones, die Android als Betriebssystem nutzen, ab – völlig unabhängig vom Gerät. Vielfach kann dieser Entwicklung jedoch entgegengewirkt werden. Folgende Tipps können laut dem Branchenportal giga.de offenbar helfen:\n- Deaktivieren Sie Animationen: Unter dem Puntk „Eingabehilfen“ können im Menü Animationen ausgeschaltet werden. Auf diese Weise wird Rechenleistung gespart, vor allem beim Wechseln und Öffnen von Fenstern.\n- Leeren Sie Ihren Cache: Der Cache von Apps kann demnach problemlos geleert werden, um Speicherplatz freizugeben – ganz im Gegenteil zum Cache von Browsern, die wichtige Daten für Websites, die alltäglich angesteuert werden, liefern.\n- Schränken Sie Hintergrundprozesse ein: Apps, die dauerhaft im Hintergrund laufen, können problemlos entfernt werden.\n- Entfernen Sie Bloatware: Sogenannte Bloatware ist meist vorinstalliert und belegt Speicherplatz. Vielfach ist sie aber nicht notwendig und kann deinstalliert werden.\n(tu) Verwendete Quellen: antutu.com, chip.de, schmidtisblog.de, giga.de",

    "text": "When it was found that Giulio Regeni had been tortured and killed, many advised the household to neglect it, that they weren’t going wherever: and sometimes it was the authorities themselves who did it. But, the need for reality and justice for Giulio by no means made his mother and father Paola and Claudio waver even for an on the spot. A will supported by the love of people that have fashioned an amazing collective motion and have given life to many initiatives, such because the yellow bench positioned on the island of the Certosa di Venezia, going through the purpose the place the ocean and the lagoon meet in reminiscence of the water that Giulio liked.\nThe affiliation Article 21 Needed by Articolo 21, the affiliation that instantly served as a media escort for the household to dismantle the falsehoods constructed and advised about Giulio, the yellow Certosa bench joins many different benches, but additionally options the brand of the underground station of Dokki in Cairo, the place the researcher was seen one final time, a approach to contribute to the telling of his story. «The media escort then turns into an emotional escort along with that of many individuals who help us», stated Paola Regeni. “Originally we talked a couple of individuals who confirmed solidarity, at present we discuss a individuals who have taken on an enormous civil dedication.”\nArticle 21 Venice and the Settemari rowing, with Claudio and Paola Regeni, Ottavia Piccolo (president of the Article 21 Venice Affiliation), Luciana Milani, mom of Valeria Solesin\n“Readability on what emerged in Report” The mother and father underlined how the thought of ​​the bench refers back to the current, to motion, to an ongoing course of and replaces, a minimum of for now, the proposal of a gravestone or a street. “It’s we who’re making historical past at present, we’re those now in motion and who’re contributing to an energetic reminiscence and due to this fact a banner, a bracelet, a bench are all an indication of a present and energetic civil dedication” the mother and father reiterated. And the request for Article 21 made by the president can be a part of the current Beppe Giulietti who from Venice loudly asks the federal government to make clear what emerged from Report which demonstrated that the State was conscious of the Giulio case earlier than the official communication of his disappearance, which occurred on the finish of January 2016, when there was Matteo Renzi premier.\nThe lifting of the Settemari rowing machine for Giulio Some passages from the e-book Giulio does issues by Feltrinelli, learn by Ottavia Piccolo, actress and president of Articolo 21 Venezia, accompanied the inauguration ceremony, additionally within the presence of Valeria Solesin the lady killed within the Bataclan assault in Paris, Luciana Milani who embraced the household.

    "title": "Young Iowa Republicans Raise Their Voices. Will Their Party Listen?",
    "text": "As Vivek Ramaswamy walked out of an event this month at Dordt University, a small Christian college in northwestern Iowa, the school’s football players greeted him with bro hugs and a challenge: Could he join one of them in doing 30 pushups? Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old entrepreneur and Republican presidential candidate, did not miss a beat. “You guys are probably about half my age or so,” he said when he was done, having strained only slightly, “and I’m probably about half the age of everyone else who’s making a real dent in American politics today.” Regardless of his age and influence, Ramaswamy is the only Republican primary candidate prioritizing an appeal to young voters. While he targets college campuses and flexes on TikTok, his rivals have largely favored courting older evangelical Christians, farmworkers and Chamber of Commerce-style voters over recruiting the next generation of Republicans. This may be partly a matter of practicality: Historically, younger voters have more often supported Democrats, and a majority have left-leaning views on issues like abortion access and climate change. That holds true in Iowa, where residents of Ames and Iowa City, the state’s largest college towns, regularly vote for Democrats. When former President Donald Trump attended the Iowa-Iowa State football game this fall in Ames, fans booed him. And while many Generation Z Republicans, born between 1997 and 2012, grew up during the Trump presidency and say they are sticking by him, interviews with nearly 20 young voters in Iowa indicated that some were ready to move on to other candidates who they believed could more easily beat President Joe Biden, without the personal baggage that has dogged Trump for years. (In 2016, 12% of voters in the Iowa Republican caucuses were between ages 17 and 29, a small slice that could nonetheless sway a close race.) Eli Harris, a first-year law student at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, said he voted for Trump in 2020 but now planned to caucus for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. “He can sway moderates,” Harris, 24, said of DeSantis. “He’s not incendiary in the wrong ways. He doesn’t tweet out something stupid at 2 a.m.” Mary Weston, 23, the chair of the Iowa Young Republicans, said she believed that Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, were connecting with young voters more deeply than Trump. In November, Haley won the Iowa Young Republicans National Federation’s mock caucus, beating Trump by nearly 15 percentage points. (Among all voters in Iowa, Trump still leads his rivals by more than 30 percentage points in most state polls.) Still, beyond Ramaswamy, the Republican candidates have taken relatively traditional approaches to courting Gen Z voters. Both Haley and DeSantis have networks of student groups who promote their candidacies on college campuses, and they have occasionally dropped by college tailgates. Trump recently wrote an opinion essay titled, “I Will Make America Great Again for Young People.” The general disconnect between the candidates and young voters was highlighted at the first Republican debate in August, when the candidates were asked how they would combat climate change, which polls routinely show is a top concern for voters younger than 30. The candidates quickly turned to spreading misinformation and insulting one another. Not one said how they would address the issue domestically. Young Republican voters in Iowa shared other concerns, including the rise of “cancel culture,” especially at universities, where they say they face attacks for espousing conservative beliefs. Some said they were more likely to be accepting of LGBTQ rights than their older counterparts and less likely to support a ban on TikTok. “Not every young Republican agrees with the old GOP, straight-ticket kind of deal,” said Logan Williams, a recent graduate of the University of Iowa who works for Americans for Prosperity, the super political action committee that has endorsed Haley. Williams, 23, said he was relieved that Haley had softened her calls to ban TikTok because he believed that “tech censorship is a First Amendment violation.” On other topics, though, young Republicans appear to be in lockstep with older conservatives. Maddy Browne, 26, said she cared deeply about a strong military and a firm presence by the United States on the world stage. “Keeping our country safe is my No. 1 goal, and having a strong country again,” said Browne, who has several relatives who are active service members. Many cited fears that inflation and rising housing costs would make it difficult for them to afford their parents’ lifestyles. “Maybe when I was 18, my family took care of that a little bit more, but now I’m dealing with those costs, and I’m mad,” said Armaan Gupta, a 22-year-old senior at Iowa State University. One of the Dordt football players, Kolson Kruse, 20, said he supported Ramaswamy because he was best suited to “get our economy going again.” Ramaswamy has vigorously tried to show that he relates to students, visiting college campuses and injecting himself into young people’s social media feeds — though his campaign’s platform, which calls to raise the voting age, does not always appear to be winning over young people, as he claims. At an event last month near Grinnell College, in Grinnell, Iowa, Ramaswamy drew several students who said they were Democrats and did not plan to support him. Attracting younger voters, no matter the candidate, has long been a challenge for the Republican Party. This month, five members of the Republican National Committee’s youth advisory panel resigned, citing a “lack of confidence we have in the RNC’s ability to win over and mobilize young voters,” according to a letter first reported by Fox News. One of them — Joe Mitchell, a former Iowa state legislator who founded Run GenZ, which recruits young conservatives to run for office — said future success for Republicans hinged on having “grassroots plans” to reach young voters with relevant policies and through digital platforms. Mitchell worries that no such plans exist. “I talk to a lot of people who weren’t historically politically super engaged that are more now,” said Mitchell, 26, who is backing Trump. “But I’m also not sold that they’re educated to show up and vote in November 2024.” In his view, Trump’s celebrity appeal may dispel such concerns. The former president has been able to maintain a base of support among young voters through his digital outreach, leveraging an army of meme-creators who promote him and disparage his rivals. Even on the issue of protecting ideological diversity on college campuses, which Ramaswamy, Haley and DeSantis have all tried to use to appeal to young voters, many of them still trust Trump. The issue has resonated with Jasmyn Jordan, the chair of Young Americans for Freedom at the University of Iowa, who recently testified to the House Judiciary Committee about the animosity and threats she and other young conservatives said they had received for hosting conservative speakers. Jordan, 20, praised Trump for saying he would withhold federal funding from schools that do not support free speech. “The fact that he actually gives consequences, rather than coddling universities and entities who aren’t doing anything to help everyone equally, is something I really admire,” Jordan said. With outreach from candidates’ campaigns seemingly haphazard, many Gen Z Republicans have taken it upon themselves to try to reach their peers. This month, Weston’s Iowa Young Republicans group hosted a Christmas party for about two dozen young conservatives inside the Stine Barn, a cavernous building in West Des Moines. As her guests drank soda and snacked on candy bars, Weston mused, “It is terrifying right now being a young person specifically and thinking about, ‘What is the country that we are going to inherit one day?’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times .",

Efforts should now be focussed on prevention rather than cure.\n“We are no longer capable of coping under current conditions with the current firefighting manpower, thus the importance of acting beforehand on prevention, rather than afterwards on firefighting and extinguishing,” she said.\nHistoric fires in Canada\nRecords tumbled on the American continent this year as it went through a forest fire season in which nearly 80 million hectares (198 million acres) had burned by December 23.\nThat is one and a half times the surface area of Spain, and 10 million hectares (24 million acres) more than the average from 2012-2022 on the same date, according to the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS).\nCanada, where 18 million hectares (44.5 million acres) went up in smoke over the year, drove the increase.\nThe fires were caused by dryer and hotter weather conditions driven by climate change.\nDeadly year\nWith 97 dead and 31 missing in fires in Hawaii in August, 34 killed in Algeria, and at least 26 dead in Greece, the year with more than 250 deaths overall was the deadliest of the 21st century, according to the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) run by the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.\nVilain-Carlotti told AFP the rate of excess deaths risks increasing in the coming years, as wildfires come dangerously close to towns and cities.\nIn 2023 the wildfires engulfed not only areas usually susceptible to forest fires like Greece, Italy, Tunisia, and Algeria in the Mediterranean basin and North America and Australia, but also areas which are usually spared like Hawaii or Tenerife.\nIn August, Hawaii’s historic royal seat of Lahaina was levelled by a wildfire.\nSix billion tonnes of CO2\nAs the fires spread even further, vegetation has less time to regrow, leaving the forests liable to lose their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.\nAccording to recent studies, the fires reduce the storage of carbon dioxide by around 10 percent, Solene Turquety, a researcher at France’s LATMOS (Atmospheres, Environments, Space Observations Laboratory), said.\nAnd as they burn, the trees suddenly release all of the CO2 that they have stored.\nSince the beginning of 2023, wildfires have released some 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to GWIS.\nThat compares to 36.8 billion tonnes from fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal and cement.\nAs a rule, around 80 percent of carbon generated by the forest fires is then reabsorbed by the vegetation which grows again the next season.\nThe remaining 20 percent then builds up in the atmosphere, contributing the climate change.\nImmediate health impact\nApart from CO2, fires release a string of dangerous particles, from carbon monoxide to ash, soot, and organic carbon.\n“These emissions very heavily alter the air quality, over hundreds of kilometres (miles) in the case of the most intense fires,” Turquety said.\nShe said there is “an immediate health impact” on top of “the destruction of ecosystems, property and infrastructure”.\nAccording to a study published in September in Nature, the populations of the poorest countries, in particular in central Africa, are by far more exposed to the air pollution caused by these fires than those in industrialised countries.\nSource: AFP",
