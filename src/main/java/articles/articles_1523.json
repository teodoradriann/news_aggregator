    "text": "A San Francisco woman has issued a warning to other people after she found her driverless taxi being blocked by men trying to get her number. [Twitter](https://www.unilad.com/twitter) user Amina shared a video of her unnerving experience in a post on September 30, in which she explained she'd been trying to use a driverless car to get to her destination when two men suddenly stopped in front of it. The company Amina was using, Waymo, offers customers a way to travel in [cars](https://www.unilad.com/cars) without the need for a driver - instead, the [autonomous cars ](https://www.unilad.com/technology)can do all the work for you. Advert Amina made clear that she 'loves' Waymo, but she admitted it was 'scary' when the men stopped in front of the car, leaving it 'stalled in the street'. The two men 'demanded that I give my number', Amina said, and she added in a follow-up post that one of the men 'stood in front of the car about a minute before [she] started filming'. \"Then he came around again and the second guy came with him. There was a random guy walking with a blow torch. I was afraid more men would crowd around which thankfully didn't happen,\" she said. In the clip, Amina could be seen shouting at the men to move away from the front of the car. The men repeatedly make a 'phone' symbol with their hands, persisting even when Amina shouted 'no' over and over again. Advert “Get out of the way! Move!” she told the men. “Oh my God, get out of the way. I have to go, please stop. You’re holding up traffic!” Amina said that 'thankfully' the ordeal 'only lasted a few minutes', but she urged other people to be aware of similar situations. After she shared her video, viewers described the ordeal as 'terrifying'. The Waymo customer added that the company was 'great' at handling the situation, as they called her through the in-car support system to help. Advert \"They also called me to follow up and all around good at solving this problem,\" Amina added. However, while Amina is not against using self-driving cars again the future, she made clear that she will 'be careful taking it alone'. Waymo responded to Amina's ordeal and said it was 'sorry' for what had happened, adding that it appreciated her 'positive feedback regarding Rider Support'. “Please know your safety remains our top priority, and we hope you’ll consider riding with us again in the future,\" the company added. Advert In a statement to [The San Francisco Standard](https://sfstandard.com/2024/10/01/viral-video-captures-dudes-trying-to-pick-up-woman-in-waymo/), Waymo added: \"Our riders have 24/7 access to Rider Support agents who will help them navigate the situation in real-time and coordinate closely with law enforcement officers to provide further assistance as needed.\" UNILAD has contacted Waymo for further comment.

They can be made from a variety of materials such as tempered glass. It can be costly to replace them when they’re damaged. But installing windows can increase the value of your business and improve its curb appeal.\nThere are a lot of things to take into account when it’s time to replace the storefront window. The cost of replacing windows can differ based on the location and the type of window. For instance, a wooden frame window is more expensive than an aluminum frame window. It’s also important to keep in mind that the installation process for each type will be different.\nWindow replacement can be carried out in a variety of ways, from taking out the entire window and frame to replacing only the glass. The cost of replacing a window is contingent on the kind of material you choose and how badly damaged it is.

They are the long, metal pieces that stretch out and extend when you open certain types of windows. They are susceptible to damage by weather or impact and need to be replaced when a window doesn’t close or open.\nThe handle of a window may cost between $75 to $100. This is the part that can be used to open and close the window and is possible to install a lock. The handles may become damaged and dirty with frequent use, but they generally just need a cleaning and re-shaping.\nAnother issue that is common is the inability of closing a window. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as a misaligned spring or a broken latch. A professional window company is the most effective way to fix this problem.\nA window repair company should be insured and licensed to ensure that they provide high-quality service.

It can range from minor cracks to serious problems like leaks or damaged seals. These types of issues are generally more difficult to fix and require a highly skilled team.\nThe most important problems that must be addressed are windows that don’t open and close correctly, leaking windows and frayed frames or weather stripping. It is crucial to identify these issues early, before they cause more expensive repairs or replacements.\nCommercial windows require more care than residential windows due to their size and location. This is why a well-established relationship with a trustworthy commercial glass repair shop can be so important. Not only can they provide the repairs and maintenance that you require however, they can also suggest upgrades that will improve the overall look of your building.\nAnother aspect of a reputable commercial glass repair service is their ability to work with your budget. They can give you a comprehensive quote that will break down the costs and options available to you. This will help you determine the best option for your needs.\nInquiring about the company’s insurance coverage and licensing status is also a good way to choose a repair service for commercial use. This is particularly important since if they’re not licensed, you could be held responsible for any mishaps that occur during the repair or replacement process.\nIn addition to the obvious security issues associated with cracked and damaged glass windows, a commercial window issue could be a drain on your energy bills. A reputable window repair service will be able to help you save money by upgrading your windows to double pane glass that has argon or krypton gas in between the panes. This will decrease heat and cold transfer, so your cooling and heating systems won’t have to perform as hard to maintain a pleasant building temperature. This can help you save money over time.",
