    "title": "How Excessive Consumption of Tea and Coffee Can Be Harmful | NewsTrack English 1",
    "text": "Tea and coffee are cherished beverages for many, providing a comforting ritual and a boost of energy. However, excessive consumption of these caffeinated drinks can have several negative effects on your health. Understanding these potential risks and learning how to manage your intake can lead to a healthier lifestyle. The Impact of Excessive Caffeine Caffeine, the primary stimulant in tea and coffee, can have various impacts on your body when consumed in excess. Here are some of the common issues associated with high caffeine intake: Headaches and Migraines: Excessive caffeine can lead to headaches or migraines. Caffeine withdrawal can also trigger headaches in regular consumers who suddenly cut back or stop drinking it. Reduced Concentration and Mental Fog: While caffeine can initially improve alertness and concentration, overconsumption can lead to mental fatigue and reduced cognitive function. This paradoxical effect may make it harder to focus and think clearly. Increased Fatigue: Overreliance on caffeine for energy can backfire. As the stimulant wears off, you might experience increased fatigue and the need for even more caffeine to counteract it. Irritability and Anxiety: High doses of caffeine can increase irritability and anxiety levels. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, which can heighten stress and lead to nervousness or mood swings. Depression and Mood Disorders: Chronic excessive caffeine consumption may contribute to mood disorders, including feelings of depression and persistent low mood. Sleep Disturbances: Consuming caffeine, especially in the late afternoon or evening, can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and reduce sleep quality, leading to insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns. Tips for Managing and Reducing Caffeine Intake If you recognize these symptoms and wish to cut down on your tea and coffee consumption, consider the following strategies: Gradual Reduction: Instead of quitting caffeine abruptly, gradually decrease your intake. If you’re used to drinking 7-8 cups a day, try reducing by one cup per day. This gradual approach helps minimize withdrawal symptoms and makes the process more manageable. Prioritize Sleep: To combat the fatigue associated with reducing caffeine, focus on improving your sleep quality. Aim for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night and establish a consistent sleep schedule. Reduce Tea Leaves and Coffee Grounds: Lower the amount of tea leaves or coffee grounds used in your beverages. This reduction decreases the caffeine content per serving, helping you cut down on overall consumption. Incorporate Detox Drinks: Replace some of your caffeinated drinks with detox drinks like herbal teas, lemon water, or cucumber water. These options keep you hydrated and may help reduce cravings for caffeine. Consult a Healthcare Professional: If you struggle to manage your caffeine intake on your own, seek advice from a healthcare provider. They can offer personalized strategies for reducing caffeine consumption and improving your overall health. The Benefits of Cutting Back on Caffeine Reducing your caffeine intake can lead to several health benefits, including: Improved Sleep Quality: With lower caffeine levels, you may find it easier to fall asleep and enjoy more restful nights. Enhanced Mood Stability: Less caffeine can lead to reduced irritability and anxiety, contributing to a more stable mood. Increased Energy Levels: Without the ups and downs of caffeine stimulation, you might experience more consistent energy levels throughout the day. Better Cognitive Function: Lower caffeine intake can reduce mental fog and improve overall concentration and cognitive performance. By understanding the potential harm of excessive tea and coffee consumption and following these practical tips, you can manage your intake effectively and enjoy a healthier lifestyle.

    "title": "A growing community of mushroom-spotters is spotlighting fascinating fungi in India",
    "text": "During the lockdowns in Delhi in 2020, when most public places were shut, the only outdoor spaces that remained accessible were the capital’s pockets of green. In parks like Sunder Nursery, Lodhi Gardens and Sanjay Van, residents found pockets of peace amidst nature. It was then that Malavika Bhatia, a 30-year-old local, began spotting fascinating mushrooms in Delhi’s parks—sprouting from decades-old tree trunks, clustered in a muddy corner and hiding expertly under plants and leaves. “They were really curious little ecosystems in their own right,” they say. Monsoon is when these ecosystems thrive, appearing in the unlikeliest places across lush forests as well as busy cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and more. We walk by these stunning mushrooms—which show up in a variety of shapes, colours and striking patterns—everyday, but only a trained eye can really spot them. Bhatia is part of a small but growing community of mushroom spotters and enthusiasts in India, who lead trails across different parts of the country, introducing curious folks to these fascinating ecosystems hidden in plain sight. Last year, they also organised the first edition of Shroom Sabha, a four-day festival in Kerala that featured foraging and exploration trails, and workshops of mushroom cultivation, pairings and more. The festival saw over 100 attendees and will be back for a second edition in October this year. Meet the mushroom spotters Bhatia is a Psychology graduate who was always interested in nature. A wild food foraging course before the pandemic got her thinking about wild mushrooms found in the country. Bhatia began leading mushroom-spotting walks in the capital in 2021. “We tend to think of cities as concrete jungles where nothing really grows. Mushrooms really disrupt that idea,” they say. “These opportunistic organisms grow anywhere and everywhere to consume food and nutrients. You can find them on the sidewalk, on tree barks, in flower pots. If you leave a chair out in your backyard for a few months, there will be mushrooms growing on it in no time. They exist all around us, and once you learn to see them, you really can’t stop noticing them.” Bhatia met Bengaluru-based Vhyom Bhatt on a mushroom enthusiasts whatsapp group with over 200 members. It was 2021 and Bhatt had just spent several months in Himachal Pradesh, where he had discovered mushrooms like gucchi (morel mushrooms), chicken of the woods and chanterelle. “Local communities in Himachal have so much knowledge about these mushroom varieties that most of us wouldn’t even know about. That’s when I really got into mushroom identification and foraging. I discovered about 30-35 mushroom species that were completely new to me,” he says. He started growing mushrooms at home, and soon joined Nuvedo, a Bengaluru-based start-up that creates mushroom-based products, including DIY mushroom growing kits. To educate consumers, he began conducting mushroom spotting walks in Bengaluru, and hasn’t stopped since. Much like Bhatia, Goa resident and naturalist Omkar Dharwadkar always felt an affinity for nature and the outdoors. When he was in college studying computer engineering, he would spend weekends in the wilderness of Goa with a small group of friends and volunteer at nature camps for kids so he could meet wildlife experts. He joined a resort as a naturalist soon after he graduated college, and went on to found Mrugaya Xpeditions, a tour company that offers nature trails in Goa. Fungi and mushrooms especially intrigued him. “They are present in every habitat in the world, from the hottest to the coldest places on earth,” he says. “What’s interesting is that they adapt to their surroundings in such unique ways, with different shapes, colours, odours and even bioluminescence,” he says. Where to go mushroom spotting in India “One thing to remember is that every place in the world will have mushrooms, and you can spot them if you’re visiting in the right season,” Bhatt says. Monsoon is the reproductive period for fungi and the best time to spot some seriously fascinating mushrooms in India. “If you go into a forest and see a lot of mushrooms, it’s a great sign that the forest floor is fertile and in prime condition,” he says. A forest's mycelial network is often likened to the human nervous system. Mushrooms help decompose dead matter, improve nutrient intake of plants and make forests and soil more resilient. And it helps that they are incredibly cool to look at; if, of course, you learn to really look. Here are Bhatia, Bhatt and Dharwadkar’s recommendations for the best places to go mushroom spotting in Delhi, Bengaluru, Goa and Kerala, and what to spot while you’re there: Delhi In Delhi, Bhatia recommends heading to Sunder Nursery and Lodhi Gardens during the monsoon to spot unusual mushrooms. One of her favourite mushrooms to spot is the bird’s nest mushroom, which mimics a tiny bird’s nest, eggs and all. “There are these mushrooms called Earth stars that are found in the Central Ridge Reserve Forest. They almost look like constellations on the forest floor,” they say. Follow Malavika on Kerala Visit Wayanad in Kerala towards the end of the monsoon season in September. “One of the most beautiful mushrooms to spot in Wayanad, on the outskirts of Periyar National Park, are bridal veil stinkhorns, named so because of the white, veil-like lacy structure around its stalk” Bhatia says. “They are gorgeous and they’re also edible. You can also find giant oyster mushrooms here that are 2-3 times the size of a human head and are also edible.” Bengaluru Bhatt recommends heading to Cubbon Park in the monsoon to spot mushrooms. “I spotted bridal veil mushrooms there, but instead of a white veil, they had bright orange veils which were so striking. You can spot termitomyces, which grow on termite mounds. These are edible and are used in many households as a meat replacement during Shravan. It’s a very heavily harvested mushroom but finding it in a public park is very cool. I have also spotted wild oyster mushrooms and beautiful orange gymnopilus at the park.” Follow Vhyom on Goa In the forested parts of Goa, away from its sandy beaches and popular tourist spots, several mushroom species grow in abundance. When the rains turn the forests of Mollem, Netravali and Mhadei lush green, mushrooms in various shapes, sizes and colours, and fascinating features like bioluminescence, make a brief but stunning appearance. “The glowing mushrooms in Goa are by far the most fascinating mushrooms I have ever seen,” says Dharwadkar. “I have mostly spotted them in the forested areas in Goa, where they appear during monsoon. There’s no way to tell exactly when and where they will appear and their lifespan is just about 2-3 days. I also love spotting glowing fungus, which appears on dead plant matter and sometimes even on live trees. The fruiting body is never visible but only the mycelium glows in the dark. I have also spotted bird’s nest mushrooms in Mollem National Park and Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. Bracket fungus typically show up across Goa in different shapes and sizes, but the fascinating part about them is the release of the spores. These are actually billions of spores being dispersed by the wind and sometimes at certain angles of light, the spores scatter light into its visible spectrum—it almost appears like smoke being released from the fungus. Lastly, zombie fungus, which is an insect-pathogenic fungus, attaches itself to insects and alters their behavioural patterns. It essentially makes the insect behave in a way that’s beneficial to the fungus. I have seen them across Goa, in various habitats, and it really is like an otherworldly experience.

    "text": "TAMPA — The Lightning are expected to be without defenseman J.J. Moser for another eight to 10 weeks as he recovers from a lower-body injury sustained Dec. 12 at Calgary.\nWhen the Lightning first placed Moser on injured reserve, coach Jon Cooper said he considered him week to week. The new timetable projects Moser to return after the 4 Nations Faceoff break in late February.\nMoser has been a major addition to the Lightning blue line after being acquired over the summer in the trade that sent defenseman Mikhail Sergachev to Utah and also netted 20-year-old forward Conor Geekie.\nMoser, 24, has contributed to better defensive play and is averaging 19:54 of ice time playing mostly in a top-pairing role on his off side on the right alongside star Victor Hedman. Moser also has played a role on the Lightning’s penalty kill and their second power-play unit.\nMoser’s plus-13 ranks second among Lightning defensemen, trailing only Ryan McDonagh’s plus-17. He has two goals, including one shorthanded, and eight assists.\nMoser left the Calgary game late in the second period after falling to the ice while chasing a loose puck along with Flames forward Nazem Kadri into the defensive end. The injury did not require surgery.\nIn Moser’s absence, right-shot defenseman Darren Raddysh has moved next to Hedman, a spot he played frequently last season. Raddysh entered Thursday with two assists in his last three games with a plus-5 since his playing time spiked.\nThe Lightning called up Steven Santini from AHL Syracuse to give them an extra right-side defenseman while out in Western Canada last week when Erik Cernak was out. Crunch right-shot defenseman Max Crozier also would have been on the short list of potential call-ups had he not been injured, but he is expected to return at the end of next week.\nThe Lightning have existing cap space, about $1.6 million according to PuckPedia, so in order to use the space that Moser’s injury could create (he carries a $3.375 million cap hit) by going on long-term injured reserve, they’d have to add contract from the minors to surpass the cap threshold before they can use LTIR.\nBut for now, it appears likely the Lightning will stick with their existing defensemen options, carrying six defensemen and 21 active players, and keeping the cap space for potential future use.\n• • •\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "text": "> VIDEO\nSi vous avez l'une de ces 5 attitudes, vous devez avoir du mal à vous faire de vrais amis Romane Tardy , Mis à jour le 30 Août 2024 06:54 Certains comportements inconscients peuvent faire de vous une personne dont il est difficile de se rapprocher ou avec laquelle devenir ami. Voici comment les identifier.\nEtre sympathique et sociable ne suffit pas toujours pour créer des liens ou se faire des amis. Avec certaines personnes, la communication est parfois difficile, désagréable, voire carrément agaçante, sans quelles ne s'en rendent compte ou qu'on sache vraiment pourquoi. Au point qu'on n'a pas vraiment envie de s'en rapprocher, même si elles sont polies et avenantes de prime abord. Vous pouvez d'ailleurs en faire partie. Ceci étant, certains signes peuvent vous éclairer. Les repérer est la première étape vers un changement. Voici 5 attitudes qui font de vous quelqu'un de difficile à vivre.\n1. Si vous êtes souvent au centre des histoires ou des désaccords, posez-vous des questions, comme le met en avant l'expert en psychologie et en relation humaine, Lachlan Brown, pour Global English Editing . Se trouver fréquemment au cœur des conflits n'est pas un hasard : vous pouvez en être le dénominateur commun. Cela ne fait pas de vous une mauvaise personne, mais implique plutôt que votre approche des interactions sociales n'est pas la bonne. Si vous n'assumez pas votre part de responsabilité dans le conflit, vous enfoncez encore plus la situation. Il faut savoir se remettre en question.\n2. Etre trop dur avec les autres peut aussi vous porter préjudice. Ne pas faire preuve d'empathie va vous empêcher de partager avec ceux qui vous entourent. Ils vont avoir l'impression d'être incompris ou que vous leur accordez peu d'importance. Se montrer à l'écoute est une véritable qualité, surtout avec une écoute active, qui est un élément clé de la communication.\n3. De même, être trop critique ne va pas vous aider à nouer des relations. Etre honnête est certes bénéfique mais lorsqu'il ne s'agit que de négativité, cela va finir par poser problème. Cette négativité se double parfois d'une tendance à la victimisation, qui n'est pas non plus favorable.\n4. Autre aspect qui rend désagréable : la rancune. Si vous faites partie de ces personnes qui ne parviennent pas à pardonner, il peut être difficile de s'entendre avec vous. L'erreur est humaine et ne jamais rien laisser passer viendra perturber vos relations alors que pardonner est un signe de compréhension. S'il ne faut pas rester coincé dans le passé, il est aussi primordial de savoir sortir de ses habitudes.\nMieux vaut éviter de boire l'eau du robinet de cette pièce, il y a un risque méconnu pour la santé\nPlus de 100 nouveaux pesticides autorisés en France, la liste des produits concernés est longue 5. Etre trop conservateur et rétif au changement est une tare. Les personnes avec lesquelles il est difficile de créer du lien sont souvent réticentes au changement et préfèrent leur zone de confort. Il est pourtant nécessaire de savoir s'adapter pour entretenir des relations saines.\nCependant, tous ces comportements ne sont pas forcément conscients. Vous n'avez alors pas une bonne conscience de vous-même et donc des conséquences de vos actes et cela empêche de nouveau de se rapprocher de vous. C'est un cercle vicieux dont il faut sortir avant tout en restant authentique mais tout en reconnaissant vos forces et vos faiblesses.",

    "text": "Madonna di Trevignano, una testimone: “Gisella faceva esorcismi e diceva di lottare con Satana” Fantomatiche guarigioni ed esorcismi sono argomenti di cui le testate giornalistiche e i programmi televisivi hanno parlato molto in concomitanza della [strage che ha scosso Altavilla Milicia](https://www.fanpage.it/attualita/che-cose-un-esorcismo-e-perche-se-ne-parla-per-la-strage-di-altavilla-milicia/), fatti che però non hanno nulla a che vedere con la fede. Ad improvvisarli sarebbe stata anche Maria Giuseppa Scarpulla, a detta di alcuni ex seguaci che hanno raccontato le loro esperienze con la veggente, che dice di vedere la Madonna a Trevignano Romano. A parlarne la trasmissione Mediaset Mattino Cinque condotta da Federica Panicucci con un servizio del giornalista Paolo Capresi. \"Gisella raccontava spesso di praticare esorcismi su persone indemoniate o che lei riteneva tali – a parlare è una testimone che vuole restare anonima – Mi ricordo più di una volta e in più di un'occasione anche fuori Trevignano che spesso la veggente faceva dei gruppi di preghiera ad esempio a Rimini o in altri posti, dove raccontava spesso di persone indemoniate e che lei si trovava sempre a \"lottare con il diavolo\". Raccontava di liberare queste persone, ma soprattutto di lottare con Satana\". Per la Chiesa cattolica gli esorcismi possono essere praticati solo da sacerdoti scelti e incaricati dal vescovo, come quello della diocesi di Civitacastellana all'interno della quale ricade Trevignano Romano e [che Fanpage.it ha intervistato](https://www.fanpage.it/roma/lesorcista-spiega-come-la-dioscesi-di-civita-castellana-indaga-sul-caso-di-trevignano-e-non-solo/). \"Gisella ha chiesto di interrompere cure mediche\" La testimone segreta intervistata da Mattino Cinque spiega: \"Alla presenza di alcuni sacerdoti Gisella imponeva le mani sopra la testa delle persone e iniziava a pregare. Se durante quel rituale la persona che stava esorcizzando non sveniva era come se non avesse funzionato. Inoltre – continua – dopo la messa – in una chiesa non specificata ndr – in sacrestia Gisella impartiva la benedizione alle persone\". La testimone con cui parla il giornalista Mediaset spiega che è successo anche che venisse chiesto di interrompere cure mediche: \"Durante il periodo del Covid per esempio io ho sentito più di una volta dire se non dimettete subito il vostro caro, che magari era ricoverato in un reparto Covid morirà, se riuscite a farlo dimettere vivrà\". Fanpage.it raccomanda al lettore di rivolgersi sempre ai medici e seguire le cure. \"Tutto falso, è autosuggestione\" Anche Luigi Avella, l'ex fedele di Gisella che ha donato volontariamente 123mila euro all'associazione Madonna di Trevignano Ets che aveva sentito parlare dei riti che faceva Scarpulla un giorno incuriosito le ha chiesto di partecipare: \"Gisella mi ha imposto le mani, io per farla contenta sono caduto sul divano, ma stavo recitando, non è successo nulla. Il marito di Gisella che era caduto dopo di me si è messo a ridere. Il problema è che molte persone ci credono a queste cose, molte plagiate si autosuggestionano, fate attenzione\".

Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#5](c5#c-5) En realidad este discurso en concreto se parece más al del ISIS que al de Hitler.\nAunque el resultado de ambos sea el mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",
