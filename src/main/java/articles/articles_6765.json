    "title": "Irish officials asked UK to drop Omagh bombing information appeal, files show – The Irish Times",
    "text": "Irish civil servants wanted an appeal for information into the Omagh bombing dropped over fears that it would anger Sinn Féin and put the progress of the peace process in jeopardy. The British government wanted to mark the second anniversary of the Omagh bombing with a joint statement from prime minister Tony Blair and taoiseach Bertie Ahern but Irish officials wanted it watered down to exclude the appeal, a move that was described as an over-reaction. New government files from 2000 released by the National Archives in London show that the initial statement had a sentence that read: “We call on everyone with any information about the atrocity to share it with the police.” The appeal came as a result of pressure from relatives who were frustrated at the lack of progress in the investigation. The 1998 bombing, carried out by the Real IRA, killed 29 people and was the deadliest single incident during the Troubles. [X case ‘horror’, ‘gay bashing’, and republican ‘headbangers’: State papers shed light on a turbulent decade](/history/2023/12/28/x-case-horror-gay-bashing-and-republican-headbangers-state-papers-shed-light-on-a-turbulent-decade/) While Irish civil servants backed the idea of a joint statement, they would not accept the appeal for information, according to a memo to Blair from Anna Wechsberg, his private secretary for foreign affairs. The Irish side feared that the next confidence building mechanism (CBM), a planned step as part of the peace process, would be threatened if the statement was included. “They are worried that an appeal in this context would be read by Sinn Féin as a move against them, and put the next CBM at risk. We think the taoiseach himself has probably not been consulted, but there is no sign of movement at official level,” wrote Wechsberg. The Northern Ireland Office believed the Irish were “over-reacting” and wanted the appeal kept in, although Wechsberg said this was unlikely to be accepted. The British ambassador to Ireland, Ivor Roberts, said the three Irish departments involved – Foreign Affairs, Justice and the Taoiseach – wanted to steer away from “getting at” any political parties. Other files show Ahern shut down suggestions in 2000 that the queen should visit Ireland over concerns about timing and security. Blair floated the idea with the then taoiseach during a private discussion between the two men. According to a memo of the meeting, Ahern was supportive of the idea but the time “was not yet right”. “He was not certain that the security risks are yet manageable and he was mindful of the damage that could be caused by anything untoward happening,” wrote Michael Tatham, a diplomat, following the meeting. “But this was something that should definitely happen after there had been further progress.” Queen Elizabeth II made a historic state visit to Ireland in May 2011, the first UK monarch to visit the Republic.",

    "text": "Os mortos en Gaza pola ofensiva militar de Israel superan os 21.300 e os feridos son máis de 55.600, despois de que nas últimas 24 horas morresen 210 persoas e 360 resultasen feridas, informou este xoves o Ministerio de Sanidade da Franxa palestina. O ministerio, controlado polo grupo islamita [Hamás](/tags/hamas/), denunciou nun comunicado \"vinte masacres contra familias enteiras\", que elevan a 21.320 os falecidos e a 55.603 os feridos tras 83 días de guerra. Sanidade advertiu novamente de ataques a centros médicos. Polo menos 142 instalacións sanitarias e 104 ambulancias foron atacadas \"deliberadamente\" desde o comezo da ofensiva israelí hai máis de dous meses e medio, quedando en moitos casos fóra de servizo. Ademais de que case un centenar de traballadores sanitarios, incluídos directores de hospitais, seguen detidos por forzas israelís, segundo o comunicado. \"A ocupación israelí ataca varias veces as proximidades do Complexo Médico Nasser e o Hospital Ao-Amal afiliado á Media Lúa Vermella en Jan Yuni\" nas últimas horas, engadiu. Respecto diso, a Media Lúa Vermella palestina asegurou que nos bombardeos israelís preto dese hospital morreron nas últimas horas dez persoas e 21 resultaron feridas, no quinto ataque en menos dunha semana. O mércores houbo 31 mortos e 25 feridos no \"asedio\" ao Hospital Ao-Amal, moitos deles desprazados pola guerra que buscan refuxio nas súas instalacións, subliñou nun comunicado. A sede da organización humanitaria e os arredores deste hospital que rexenta en Jan Yunis, no sur de Gaza [, acollen a preto de 14.000 desprazados, destacou. ](/tags/franja-de-gaza/) Os ataques de artillería israelí provocaron graves danos na súa sede o mércores, con numerosos feridos e a destrución do sistema de comunicacións, complicando aínda máis o traballo de servizos como o de ambulancias, lamentou. O ataque a Israel do grupo islamita Hamás o pasado 7 de outubro provocou máis de 1.200 mortos e uns 240 reféns foron levados a Gaza. Israel declarou a guerra a Hamás en Gaza e lanzou unha ofensiva por terra, mar e aire que ademais dese enorme número de vítimas obrigou a desprazarse a preto de 1,9 millóns de gazatíes, ao redor do 85 % da poboación do enclave.",

    "text": "VENTURA, Calif. (KABC) -- Even as high surf pounds coastal Southern California this week, some Ventura County homeowners are still cleaning up damage from last week's flash floods. The Blackwell family is left living out of an Airbnb after murky, knee-deep water flooded the entire first floor of their Ventura home. The Blackwells don't live in a flood zone, so they don't have flood insurance. They are stuck with massive repair bills even as they won't be able to return to their home for some time. Amanda Blackwell has started a GoFundMe to help her parents rebuild, spelling out the nightmare in a detailed narrative on the page. The flood happened in the early morning hours last week. The family noticed the street outside their home was submerged in water as the rain came down in sheets. It appeared the rain was too much for the storm drains on their street to handle. The swelling water turned into a rushing river that slammed into their garage and wound through their entire first floor. \"It started coming in and at that point, we were like, We have to stop it,\" Amanda Blackwell said. \"And you know, no, no, you can't stop the water.\" \"And then that's kind of when my survival brain clicked on and I ran to the window to kind of assess what was happening outside and I saw my car underwater. It was floating, the mailbox in the front was almost completely submerged.\" Mike Blackwell tried to go outside with a shovel and unclog the storm drain. The water rose up to his waist and he had to stop out of fears of getting swept away. \"I stopped because it was kind of swift going downstream,\" he said. \"Amanda was out - my daughter - and she says Dad, don't go any farther.\" Several of their neighbors suffered water damage as well. The Blackwells expect to be displaced for several months.",
