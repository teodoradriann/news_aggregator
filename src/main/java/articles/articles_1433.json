    "text": "KEY POINTS - October 2024 was the hottest October on record in San Antonio - With only a hundredth of an inch of rain, October 2024 was also the second-driest October on record in San Antonio - Records for the Alamo City date back to the mid-1880s - This follows a [warmer, drier-than-average September](https://www.ksat.com/weather/2024/10/03/weather-recap-september-2024-by-the-numbers-in-san-antonio/), adding to the rapid expansion of drought across South Central Texas OCTOBER TEMPERATURES - Coolest morning low: 54 degrees on Oct. 17 - Hottest afternoon high: 98 degrees on Oct. 14 - Average monthly temperature: 78.5 degrees October 2024′s average monthly temperature of 78.5 degrees makes it the hottest October found in the history of San Antonio record keeping. This breaks the previous record of 78 degrees found in 1931. Eighteen days featured high temperatures in the 90s, including Halloween, where a high temperature of 90 degrees also set a record for the hottest Halloween of all time in the Alamo City. OCTOBER RAINFALL - Monthly rainfall total: 0.01 inch - Highest daily rainfall total: 0.01 inch Oct. 29 - Number of days with measurable rainfall: 1 On average, October is typically San Antonio’s third-wettest month in a given year. This year it was anything but that, with only one hundredth of an inch of rain recorded at San Antonio International Airport on Oct. 29. That was also *just enough* to end a 53-day stretch of consecutive days without measurable rainfall, the longest stretch since 1996.

This brings our year-to-date total to 21.31 inches, which is 6.99 inches below where we should be for this time of year when compared to the average. Keep in mind that [September was also a drier-than-average month](https://www.ksat.com/weather/2024/10/03/weather-recap-september-2024-by-the-numbers-in-san-antonio/) in the Alamo City. This dry stretch has led to a rapid expansion of drought across South Central Texas. Just take a look at the difference in the drought monitor from Sept.10 to Oct. 29: Drought monitor as of September 10: Drought monitor as of October 29: LOOKING AHEAD TO NOVEMBER - On average, November is typically a drier month with an average monthly rainfall total of 2.08 inches. - While the average high temperature at the beginning of the month is 77 degrees, the average high at the end of the month falls to 68 degrees. - The average low temperature at the beginning of the month is 55 degrees, while the average low at the end of the month drops to 45 degrees.

    "title": "XYO 2.0: Jordan Trouw Unveils XYO's 2024 Roadmap and Innovations",
    "text": "In the ever-evolving realm of Web3 technology, XYO emerges as a trailblazer, poised to redefine the digital landscape with its groundbreaking XYO 2.0. At the helm of this transformative journey is Jordan Trouw, the Head of Customer Experience at XYO. Jordan, a seasoned expert in the field, serves as a guiding force, steering the company toward a new era of innovation and user-centric development. In this exclusive interview, we delve into the intricacies of XYO’s visionary roadmap for 2024, exploring key features such as the XYO 2.0 platform, the revolutionary “Build the Future” Initiative, and the exciting additions of Crypto Cards and XYO World. Join us as Jordan Trouw unveils the strategic initiatives, community-driven programs, and cutting-edge technologies propelling XYO into a future where Web2 and Web3 seamlessly converge, offering users unparalleled sovereignty in the digital landscape. Q1. To kick things off, can you elaborate on the key features of XYO 2.0 and how it redefines the internet landscape by connecting the real world with Web2 and Web3? XYO 2.0 makes Web3 accessible and easy, while completely lowering the barrier of entry for sovereignty on the internet. Coming in 2024 will be the XYO platform node, where a user can simply head to a website and immediately have an XYO node running, without any developer experience necessary. The node platform will have a variety of consumer-focused Web3 solutions, such as Live Sharing & PermaShare, where a user can create sharing links for regular Web2 experiences, but with the added permanency and sovereignty benefits of Web3. The platform will also offer a developer space for creators to build with XYO technology, and a variety of other dApps, as laid out in our [roadmap](https://xyo.network/roadmap). Q2. The “Build the Future” Initiative is an intriguing concept. How does XYO plan to encourage community members to actively participate in the development process, and what kind of rewards can contributors expect? In the coming year, XYO will also launch “Build the Future,” an initiative positioned at the crossroads of innovation and incentives within the realm of Web3 development. Part of the initiative includes a bounty system, where contributors and participants can earn rewards ranging from badges, to NFTs, to XYO Tokens for completing tasks. Developers will have the opportunity to engage in a revolutionary journey through our three-tiered system, catering to individuals ranging from coding beginners to experienced developers and tech enthusiasts. Moreover, developers can explore a multitude of opportunities addressing crucial challenges in the Web3 landscape, spanning from standardized data and programming basics to essential developer tools. Build the Future provides a variety of activity tracks, each offering rewards tailored to the expertise of individual developers. Whether someone is initiating their first XYO Node, integrating a wallet, or delving into the intricacies of core XYO technology, the initiative promises limitless possibilities and exclusive rewards. On top of the bounty system, the new node platform will also have a secret mini-game that participants can join daily, to encourage active participation with XYO technology, and grow the XYO community around the world. 2024 will also be full of more community opportunities to win giveaways on our socials, so keep an eye out for more fun things in the pipeline! Q3. Can you provide more details about the three tracks in the “Build the Future” Initiative and how they cater to participants with different levels of coding expertise? Our network attracts a diverse audience, so we needed to design the program so that anyone – of any background – who believes in XYO and wants to contribute can do so. Our first track does not rely on any coding experience, so absolutely everyone is invited to participate. Users can earn rewards for identifying bugs, providing feedback on the node set-up process, and many other activities that don’t require a high degree of expertise. Some tasks may even include simply using the technology daily — some examples could be rewards for usage streaks, sharing new developments with others, etc. Our second track caters to developers near the start of their coding journey, and provides RFPs for initiatives that require basic technical understanding and a basic command of coding languages, but don’t require intense expertise. These projects also tend to have a wealth of guides and support available online to ease the burden on burgeoning developers. Finally, our third track is intended for expert programmers and tasks them with complex initiatives. These projects are often much larger and require a high degree of self-reliance and know-how. Some examples might include building a write-only rust client adhering to specific requirements, or building a new dApp leveraging XYO technology. All together, we hope to attract a wide variety of participants across a wide spectrum of coding backgrounds. We’ll be keeping a close eye on the program’s reception and adding and adjusting tracks as needed, so we can best leverage our awesome community and their overflowing pool of talent and ambition. Q4. The introduction of the XYO platform node for desktop users is a significant development. How does this tool enhance user experience, and what role does it play in completing Builder Bounties? It is an exciting development! The platform node will be a place where the entire XYO community can experience the power of XYO technology. The best part? Users will be able to set up an XYO Node in less than a minute! Through the platform node, people will engage with vibrant visual representations of XYO technologies and node statuses, all while effortlessly navigating through the available Build the Future features. For example, Builder Bounties will start on the node platform. There, developers can test out new projects and architectures, view lists of bounties, and more. The beginning stages of the Builder Bounty Program will start small so users can familiarize themselves with the UX, and we’ll roll out features and updates over the next few months. Q5. Can you share some insights into the native dApps that come with the platform node, such as Settings, System Visualizer, System Dashboard, and Security? How do these contribute to the overall functionality of the XYO platform? The native dApps will be built into the system, so they will be rolled out automatically with the first version of the node platform, and subsequent updates. Most are self-explanatory and to be expected of any new system, for example, Settings. This dApp could host a variety of options, such as privacy settings, configuration options, or even theme and design settings to improve the XYO user’s experience with the system. Security is a key component of the node platform because it’s of utmost importance to offer each user sovereignty over how they want to share their node, how public they want to make their node, etc. At the start, it may be rolled up into our Settings dApp for easier acclimation for users. The Visualizer and Dashboard dApps are designed to help users adjust to a Web3 system. Visual components will help direct users through a sea of nodes and connected addresses, and the dashboard will provide a more comprehensive and quantitative view of the node system a user is running. The look will most likely be similar to the XYO Mobile App some of our users may remember from a few years back, and will provide a new look into XYO 2.0 technology. All of the native dApps are designed to be permanently a part of a running node and unable to be removed from the web system, as they all contribute to the experience and functionality of the platform node. Q6. The “Sharable Personal Info Card” dApp seems like an interesting addition for users to personalize their interactions with XYO. How does this dApp work, and what kind of information can users share with it? Overall, the Personal Info Card will aim to improve customization and personal expression on Web3, while also encouraging the community to use XYO products and XYO in daily life. We don’t want to spill all the details just yet, so keep an eye out for updates in our newsletters and social media! Q7. Crypto Cards and XYO World are exciting additions to the XYO ecosystem. Can you provide more details about the gameplay dynamics of Crypto Cards and how XYO World leverages geospatial NFTs for a play-to-earn experience? Similar to the Personal Info card, the Crypto Cards and XYO World experiences will promote engagement and daily use. But for now, we’re keeping tight-lipped about some of this! At their core, both apps will offer PvP (competitive) gaming, and most importantly, they will be examples of sovereign gaming in the Web3 world. For example, users could see asynchronous gaming, XYO payload-driven levels, or smart contracts that influence games. Q8. The Living Roadmap concept is intriguing. How will XYO ensure continuous updates to the roadmap throughout 2024, and what can users expect in terms of new products and dApps being added? The Living Roadmap underscores XYO’s commitment to transparency and adaptability. Continuous updates throughout 2024 will be driven by new product developments, emerging technologies, and feedback from our dynamic community. As XYO evolves, users can anticipate becoming more of a prominent driving force, sparking the idea for new additions, improvements, and interactive elements for developers and users alike. We want to ensure that XYO’s roadmap remains as fitted to the community’s needs, so while it’s susceptible to change, that room for flexibility is where the best of our offerings can sprout. You can stay updated and invested on the latest by following our Github and signing up for the newsletter. Q9. How does XYO plan to ensure that the XYO community remains engaged and excited throughout the year as new products and dApps are developed and added to the roadmap? XYO plans to keep the community engaged by not only launching exciting products and dApps that speak to their needs, but also keeping them up-to-date across XYO’s social media channels like Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and more. We are fortunate to have a buzzing community of passionate devs, creators, crypto enthusiasts, and blockchain leaders who support our projects – it’s why the Build the Future Initiative is possible, encouraging coders of all levels to actively interact, contribute, and shape the future of the XYO platform. Most importantly, based on community feedback, those engaged with XYO can play an active role in improving just how customized, engaging, and practical the ecosystem’s future updates become. Those interested in keeping apprised of all things XYO can also sign up for our [newsletter](https://xyo.network/newsletter) and follow our [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@OfficialXYO). Q10. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, what milestones or achievements is XYO most excited about, and how do you envision these developments shaping the trajectory of the XYO ecosystem in the coming years? Personally, I am most excited for the upcoming node platform secret mini-game. Not only have I been advocating for the game for some time now, but it’s based on a game that many members of the XYO team have enjoyed! I’m also a huge fan of puzzles, quizzes, and things in that realm — so I am hoping the community loves it as much as I do! The other thing I’m pretty stoked about is the Personal Info Card; while the name isn’t the most thrilling (just yet at least), I am excited to bring more personalization and self-expression to our products. As someone who spent a good two hours perfecting Oblivion and Skyrim characters in my childhood, I truly enjoy being able to inject personality into technology in all kinds of ways.

    "text": "If you are awaiting the FSD [Beta V12](https://driveteslacanada.ca/tag/fsd-v12/) update, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has good news: the new update is undergoing extra testing before a wider release. The boss explained why extra testing is required on X (formerly known as Twitter). Musk said the new version is already running on a lot of cars. However, due to being a completely different architecture, the software update has to be tested more than usual. According to Musk, the FSD Beta V12 update already works well in California but needs more training for areas with higher precipitation. https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1740189939936248225?s=20 FSD Beta V12 takes the navigation software from a rules-based to a network-path-based AI method, meaning it will function based on human driving data rather than rules programmed into the software. One Tesla staff member on the FSD team boasted the new update will ensure an autonomous car never gets involved in a collision, “even in unstructured environments.” Interestingly, this version might be the last to carry the Beta tag. Tesla [employees have been testing Beta V12 since last month](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-fsd-v12-releases-to-employees-could-be-included-in-holiday-update/), according to Musk. More employees got the update in December. According to estimates, more than 15,000 Tesla employees have been running the update, with a general release expected toward the end of January 2024.

    "text": "Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. TEXAS (Texas Tribune) — The U.S. Department of Justice has threatened to sue to stop a new Texas law that allows state police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the border — unless Gov. Greg Abbott backs off of enforcing the law. The new law, known as Senate Bill 4 , is “unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government’s operations” vis-à-vis immigration and border enforcement, an agency official told Gov. Greg Abbott in a letter first reported Thursday by the Houston Chronicle and later posted on social media by a CBS News reporter . If Texas does not formally refrain from enforcing the law by Jan. 3, the agency will “pursue all appropriate legal remedies to ensure that Texas does not interfere with the functions of the federal government.” A person with knowledge of the letter confirmed that it had been sent. An Abbott spokesperson did not immediately return an email requesting comment. The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. The DOJ’s threat came as welcome news to Democrats. “Asking local police to hunt down Texans who look like immigrants doesn’t make us safer: in fact, it takes police away from investigating real crime,” U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Austin, said in a statement. “The federal government must block this unconstitutional anti-immigrant policy before it takes effect.” The new law makes crossing the Texas-Mexico border between ports of entry a Class B misdemeanor. If a migrant agrees to return to Mexico, a judge can drop the charges. Otherwise, a suspected offender faces a potential six-month jail sentence — with longer sentences for repeat offenders. Abbott signed the law Dec. 18 and it’s slated to take effect March 5. The DOJ said in its letter that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws — an assertion backed up by federal court rulings, including by the U.S. Supreme Court. That argument is at the heart of a lawsuit brought last week by El Paso County and immigrants rights groups to overturn the law and stop it from taking effect. Abbott has said that the federal government is shirking its duties when it comes to immigration enforcement — and has therefore left that job to the state. Even so, the law has drawn the ire of Mexican officials. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has also threatened to challenge the law. \" U.S. Department of Justice says it’ll sue if Texas enforces new law punishing illegal border crossing \" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Esta declaratoria se da en el marco del Día Internacional de la Mujer.\nEste expediente presenta una serie de valores históricos, científicos y sociales, relacionados a la identificación de su autenticidad, antigüedad y contenido. Representa, además, el desarrollo del papel de la mujer peruana en la guerra a finales del siglo XIX.\nEl valor histórico de este expediente, permite dar a conocer diversos aspectos del período de la República del Perú durante la guerra con Chile.\nAdemás, muestra como valor de fuente de la historia de nuestro país, por la forma en que el Ejército del Perú organizaba a las mujeres para asistir a los regimientos de infantería y caballería, con la finalidad de preparar la defensa de Lima en diciembre de 1880. Legitimando así, su papel en la logística que anteriormente cumplían las mujeres en estos batallones militares, personificado en las llamadas “rabonas”.\nEl valor científico de estos expedientes presenta un notable potencial como fuente primaria para la investigación histórica, en especial como complemento de las fuentes más conocidas sobre la guerra con Chile, en especial en lo relativo a la participación de la mujer y sectores populares en la defensa de Lima.\nEl valor económico-social radica en que se muestra una coyuntura en la que las necesidades y urgencias de la guerra posibilitaron que el gobierno organice el papel de la mujer en los regimientos, que durante mucho tiempo se halló invisible o menospreciado.\nAunque en el caso peruano, como el boliviano y parcialmente el chileno mismo, la imagen antigua de la rabona aun persistía, siendo la base de alguna de estas listas, la unión conyugal de la auxiliar con su soldado.\nSegún estudios, las “rabonas”, generalmente, marchaban detrás de la columna de soldados, preparaban la comida y atendían a sus maridos, parejas, familiares o hijos; reparaban uniformes, los parchaban y reforzaban para su mejor resistencia frente al combate, además, realizaban otras tareas domésticas.\nEsta declaratoria se efectúa a través de la Resolución Viceministerial N°000062-2024-VMPCIC/MC, que lleva la firma de la viceministra de Patrimonio Cultural e Industrias Culturales, Victoria Rosas.\nEscrito por\nTVRobles\nMedio especializado en el sector Cultura.\nPublicado en\nTVRobles\nCultura para todos.",

    "title": "Tom Homan criticizes the Pope",
    "text": "On Tuesday, Tom Homan made disrespectful and hurtful remarks about the Pope, showing a lack of respect for the religious head of 1.5 billion Catholics globally.\nAnd it warmed my heart.\nFrom a Reuters story regarding a letter the Pope wrote to American bishops:\nIn a recent statement, the Pope criticized Trump’s deportation agenda, emphasizing that it is unfair to label all undocumented immigrants as criminals.\nThe pontiff urged all members of the Catholic Church to reject discriminatory narratives that harm migrant and refugee communities, promoting compassion and solidarity instead.\nFrancis, pope since 2013, has long been critical of Trump’s immigration policies. In 2016, during Trump’s first White House campaign, the pope said Trump was “not Christian” in his views on immigration.”\nResponding to that letter, Border Czar Tom Homan (a lifelong Catholic himself) said, “I’ve got harsh words for the Pope.” He continued, “He ought to fix the Catholic Church and concentrate on his work and leave border enforcement to us.”\nKaboom. Well, that’s a solid gut punch delivered. Basically: Clean up your own matters with pedophila and global pervert trafficking. Until that’s done and well in the past maybe you get to lecture people again. Maybe, if there are any Catholics who still listen to you.\nNow, there’s a lot that can be dissected in this reply by Homan, but my point here is to say something about the Pope.\nFirst, I don’t like this man. I think this man is a socialist born of the Liberation Theologies of the 1980s. I was a reporter for a Catholic newspaper in the 80s while a seminarian for the priesthood, and had to cover a lot of protests by militant nuns, peace and justice activists, and Jesuits like the Berrigan brothers who liked to make their points by throwing blood on stuff. A lot of this type of behavior was fueled by Jesuit thinking. At the time, I was attending Rockhurst College (part of the Jesuit system like St. Louis University, Fordham, Creighton, etc….I was studying for another order, not the Jesuits, by the way), and these assignments did not particularly sit well with my gut.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
