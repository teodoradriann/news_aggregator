    "text": "During Israel's latest attack on Iran at the end of In October, an active top-secret nuclear weapons research center was destroyed, reports \"Axios\". It is about the \"Taleghan\" facility. 2 at the Parchin Military Complex, about 20 miles southeast of Tehran. The attack reportedly damaged sophisticated equipment used to engineer the plastic explosives that surround the uranium in a nuclear device and are needed to detonate it. A US official said on condition of anonymity that the facility was carrying out \"scientific activity that could lay the foundation for the production of nuclear weapons\". The source also added that it was \"top secret\", even unknown to most of the Iranian government. Iran is enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90 percent needed to make an atomic bomb. If this material were further enriched, it would be enough for two nuclear weapons, according to the IAEA. Iran denies that it is trying to build nuclear weapons, but no other country has enriched uranium to this level unless it is aiming for such production.",

    "text": "DALLAS CENTER, Iowa — An animal rescue nonprofit has started a memorial fund and will name a shelter in honor of one of its youngest supporters, Eloise Peck of Dallas, who died in the devastating floods in Central Texas over the July 4 holiday.\nPeck had started a dog walking service over the summer, with 25% of her earned proceeds going to Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue, a nonprofit animal rescue service in Arkansas.\n\"Eloise (LuLu) Peck was a bright, joyful spirit who brought warmth and laughter into every life she touched,\" the nonprofit said in a post on its website. \"At just eight years old, her profound love and compassion for animals shone brightly, reflecting the purity and kindness of her heart. She started a dog walking service this summer with 25% of her earned proceeds going to Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue. In honor of Lulu's beautiful life and the extraordinary love she held for animals, Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue has established this memorial fund. Your generous donation will continue Lulu's legacy by helping to provide care, love, and support to animals in need.\"\nFor more information about the memorial fund and to donate, click here.\nBlueberry Hill Farm and Rescue says a newly constructed shelter there will also be named Lulu’s Puppy Hut in honor of Peck.\n\"Together, we will keep Lulu's memory alive, nurturing hope and healing for animals. Lulu’s name will forever live on at BHFAR with a newly constructed shelter officially being named Lulu’s Puppy Hut. This shelter will provide much-needed warmth, safety, and a loving place for our foster puppies to stay until we find their forever homes …We will cherish our sweet Lulu, her name, and her love of animals daily here at our rescue farm,\" their website reads.\nBlueberry Hill Farm and Rescue had just shared a post on social media about Peck's support of the nonprofit on June 18.\n\"Our favorite little Blueberry Ambassador Lulu Rogers Peck is pounding the pavement, literally!\" Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue said at the time. \"She started a dog walking service this summer and has amazingly offered to share 25% of the proceeds to Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue. Dallas is the home to some of the MOST generous and giving people I am honored to know.\"\nPeck was among a growing number of victims killed in catastrophic flooding in Central Texas. Neighbors in Highland Park are memorializing all of the victims by tying green ribbons to trees.",

    "text": "PARIS -- Canada earned three medals, with two golds courtesy of two of its biggest names at the Paralympic Games on Day 8.\nWheelchair racer Brent Lakatos earned gold in the men's T53 800 metres on the track on Thursday, while Aurelie Rivard picked up gold in the women's S10 400-metre freestyle in the pool. Swimmer Tess Routliffe added bronze in the women's SB7 100-metre breaststroke.\nFor the 44-year-old Lakatos, it was career medal No. 13 and his first Paralympic gold since the 2016 Games when he won the 100. The Dorval, Que., native won four silvers at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021.\n\"It's a really great feeling,\" said Lakatos, who is competing in his fifth Paralympics. \"This has taken a lot of planning. The Canadian support staff have been great.\n\"We had a great strategy, taking control of the race. We executed the plan and it worked out really well.\"\nLakatos now has two medals in Paris, having also taken silver in the 400. But it was a tough road.\n\"My training has been modified due to a broken rib,\" he said. \"But I was able to get back for here and I'm obviously in great shape. I had a stress fracture. I was in really great shape then something started hurting at the very end of May.\n\"Luckily I had just enough time to get back, though I missed the whole competition season. That's why I've got no season's bests.\"\nMeanwhile, for the 28-year-old Rivard, it was also career medal No. 13 and her third in Paris. Rivard also earned bronze in the 50 freestlye and silver in the 100 freestyle.\nThe St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., native became the first Canadian swimmer to win a gold medal in the same event in three consecutive Paralympic Games since Stephanie Dixon won the S9 100 backstroke in 2000, 2004, and 2008.\nWhile calling it a surreal moment, Rivard referenced back to her silver in the 100 freestyle, an event she had won gold in at the previous two Paralympics. She was disappointed and even said she thought of going home after it, adding she had not swam that slow in 10 years.\n\"I had to find the confidence to show up tonight and deliver,\" Rivard said. \"It took a lot and I am really proud. I am happy I was able to overcome my fears.\"\nFor Routliffe, it was a long time coming after finishing fourth eight years ago at the 2016 Rio Paralympics.\nThe 25-year-old was unable to compete at the Tokyo Games in 2021 due to a back injury as well.\n\"It was a good race. I get in the water and I just want to race the person next to me,\" Routliffe said. \"That's exactly what I did. I put my heart into that race and I am happy to be on the podium again.\n\"Getting on that podium is huge. We've been working on that race a lot. Those girls are quick. Just got to get out and race them.\"\nIt's the second medal of these Games for Routliffe, having also earned silver in the SM7 200-metre individual medley.\nIn women's sitting volleyball, Canada will play Brazil for bronze on Saturday. The Canadians fell 3-0 to China on Thursday in the semifinals.\nCanada's men's wheelchair basketball squad will play Germany for bronze on Saturday.\nThe Canadians fell 80-43 to the United States in the semifinals on Thursday. Patrick Anderson paced Canada with 16 points.\nIt's the first time Canada will play for a medal since winning gold at the 2012 London Games.\nCanada fell 6-1 to Thailand in the bronze-medal game in mixed pairs BC4 boccia action.\nIn judo action, Priscilla Gagne of Sarnia, Ont., lost her bronze-medal match against Argentina's Paula Karina Gomez.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 5, 2024.\nRelated Stories Canada's Nicholas Bennett captures second Paralympic swim gold, Maxwell earns silver Canada earns gold, bronze between the track and the pool on Day 6 of the Paralympics Swimmer Nicholas Bennett wins Canada its first gold of 2024 Paris Paralympics",
