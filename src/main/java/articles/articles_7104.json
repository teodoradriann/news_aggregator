    "text": "Embed share Singapore to End Cat Ban in Public Housing by VOA - Voice of America English News Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. The URL has been copied to your clipboard Share on Twitter No media source currently available\n0:00 0:06:10 0:00 Direct link 128 kbps | MP3 64 kbps | MP3 Pop-out player Sunny is a proud Singaporean citizen who follows the laws of her country. Mostly, anyway. For the last three years, she has been illegally sheltering a cat called Mooncake.\nA 34-year-old Singaporean law bars cats from government-built housing. Such housing is where most of the city-state’s population lives - and Mooncake too, although secretly.\nLuckily for Sunny and her cat, Singapore plans to end the feline ban later this year.\nThe legal change will free Sunny from the threat of a $3,007 fine or her pet's possible removal.\nThe 30-year-old works in marketing and asked to be identified only by her first name for the security of her cat. She did not want to risk officials removing Sunny from her care.\nShe wonders about the reasoning behind the ban.\n\"Cats are so much quieter than dogs. If they allow dogs, I don't understand why not cats.\"\nFILE - A Ragdoll cat named Mooncake sits in a cat tree in a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Singapore on December 19, 2023. (REUTERS/Edgar Su) Officials rarely enforce the ban. And the law is only for the high-rise Housing and Development Board (HDB) buildings. Eighty percent of Singapore’s 3.6 million people live in the buildings.\nThe ban does, however, make life difficult for cat owners. One problem they face is health care for their animals. Medical insurance cannot be provided for illegal pets.\nLawmaker Louis Ng campaigned to end the ban. He said the law sometimes becomes part of disputes between neighbors.\n\"A lot of times, the cats are collateral when there's neighborly disputes,\" he said. One neighbor will threaten to tell police about another neighbor’s cat.\nEstablished in 1960, the HDB plan sells government-built housing directly to citizens for 99-year special agreements. The policy has led to one of the world's highest home-ownership rates. Still, people who live in the buildings are subject to many restrictions and laws.\nCats were permitted in HDB apartments until 1989 when lawmakers changed the housing law. On its website, the HDB says cats are difficult to keep contained in individual homes. It also says that cats drop hairs and other body waste in public areas and can be loud.\nIt is not clear what made the Singapore government decide to end the cat ban. But a 2022 government public opinion study may have been the turning point. The study results showed 9 out of 10 Singaporeans believed that cats were fit to keep as pets, including in HDB buildings.\nOfficials are requesting public input on a proposed cat management policy.\nDogs have not been subject to a similar ban, but they are limited to one per household. And, only some kinds of dogs are permitted.\nMarket research company Euromonitor International has predicted a big increase in cat ownership. It estimated Singapore's current pet population at around 94,000 cats and 113,000 dogs.\nLawmaker Ng, who ran an animal aid group before joining parliament in 2015, also hopes the change will lead more people to adopt rescued cats.\nUnder the new rules, HDB homeowners would be limited to two pet cats. The rules also require owners to register their pets with the government. The owners must also get special identifying electronic devices for the animals. And, owners must install protective devices on windows so cats do not get out.\nSome cat lovers say the new laws do not go far enough.\nThenuga Vijakumar from the Cat Welfare Society wants the law to require sterilization . Another cat rescuer, Chan Chow Wah, urges officials to punish irresponsible owners. He said he had to take care of a cat that fell from a high window in one home. The owners refused to pay its medical bills. Wah also took care of another cat that was abandoned because he had heart disease.\n\"I end up taking over these cases. Basically, I look after them until they pass away,\" said Chan, estimating he spent $45,100 on cat medical expenses in 2022.\nBut for many cat owners the law will bring peace of mind.\nIncluding Mooncake’s: \"I think it's a good thing and it's a step forward after 30 years,\" Sunny said.\nI’m John Russell.\nXinghui Kok reported on this story for Reuters.

    "text": "Preparing for change in a well-established, well-capitalized industry is not easy.\nSuch is the story for ticker symbol BYND, formally known as Beyond Meat (BYND) in supermarket aisles across the US.\nWhile Beyond Meat's stock price has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown has not. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry executive is focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n“We believe the cycle of history is in our favor and we're going to turn it into long-term success,” Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above). ,\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business.\nBeyond Meat burst onto investors' radar with a spectacular initial public offering on Nasdaq on May 5, 2019.\nInvestors gobbled up shares of a company they viewed as a leader in the emerging plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 per share, opened for trading at $46 and then rose to $65.75 by the close. Profit at the closing bell: a delicious 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite on May 2, 2019 in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\nFrom there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, including big deals with global restaurant chains like Yum! The brand is planning expansion into the refrigerated food sections of retailers such as KFC and Dunkin' Donuts (YUM), Target (TGT) and overseas, and efforts are underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items. Are.\nBy July 2019, Beyond Meat shares reached a peak of $234.90 per share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the restaurant industry, and its financial impact sent people turning back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat's impressive momentum has stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including rival Impossible Foods.\nAdditionally, attacks from strong parties in the meat industry and media on the healthfulness of plant-based items have damaged Beyond Meat's standing with consumers. By November 2022, as losses hit cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its employees.\nThen in November this year, Beyond Meat – which has cut prices to stimulate demand – said it would cut 19% of its non-production workforce after a lower-than-expected third quarter.\nThird-quarter sales fell 8.7% from a year earlier to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million based on adjusted operating profit.\n“You know there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and especially after the IPO,” Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round. “It was going to happen overnight.” Retrenchment. “This has clearly not been proven to be the case.”\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: surround yourself with great people, take a long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course.\n“But the reason we started this company and the reason consumers are reaching out to a product is getting stronger day by day, whether it's the health aspect, whether it's climate, whether it's energy and Whether it's water use or animal welfare,” Brown added. , “All of those issues are becoming serious, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.”\nToday, Beyond Meat's stock is trading at $8.95 per share – well below its staggering post-IPO high. According to comparative data from Yahoo Finance, the company has a market cap of $577.6 million, while Meat King Tyson (TSN) has a market cap of $18.46 billion.\n“In terms of the reasons for the softening in the US, it's pretty much the same: consumers continue to shy away from the category for a number of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or lack thereof),” said JPMorgan packaged foods analyst Kane. Are included.” Goldman said.\nGoldman has given Beyond Meat shares an underweight rating, which is equivalent to a sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat Founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) inside their new El Segundo, California headquarters about the path forward for the plant-based meat company. (Yahoo Finance)\nBrown, meanwhile, is focused on dismissing the critics. Beyond Meat recently opened a massive 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, California, just steps away from the headquarters of Barbie maker Mattel (MAT). The space is equipped with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a typically open floor plan that could herald the next big thing in plant-based dining.\nThe new facility also features a McDonald's (MCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 tall Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often walks around the building to interact with staff with his trademark calm, welcoming atmosphere.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won't be easy and he's not in the mindset to consider the business path forward yet at this point. But he will not shy away from his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and passion.\n“I want to see [my mission] Until completion,” Brown said. ''I think it would be something [that] When it's all said and done, I'll look back. But I'm in a fight right now, so it's hard to watch.”\nbrian sozzi is the executive editor of Yahoo Finance.

    "title": "Fact check: Labour has not been in charge of immigration policy since 2010",
    "text": "Conservative governments have been in charge of immigration policy since they were elected in 2010 (PA) On Tuesday June 4, the Conservative Party posted a video on TikTok, featuring Home Secretary James Cleverly outlining three ways the Labour Party had “screwed up the UK’s immigration system before”. It included the following claims: 1. In 2004, a Labour government had sent “search parties” to increase migration to the UK, according to Peter Mandelson. 2. In 2016 Yvette Cooper, who is currently shadow home secretary, said that Labour had allowed too much migration while last in power, despite calling for every council in the country to take in 10 more migrant families a year earlier. 3. Sir Keir Starmer had called for a return to freedom of movement in 2020. Evaluation The video discusses real statements made by Labour figures. However, it is not possible to say calls for a return to freedom of movement, or for every council in the country to take in more migrants, had any bearing on Government policy or have impacted the UK’s immigration system. Neither of these ideas have become policy since being proposed. The facts For Mr Cleverly’s first claim, the video references a Daily Mail article from 2013. This features comments from Lord Peter Mandelson, who has held various positions in the Labour Party, at a think tank event. He is quoted as saying: “In 2004 when as a Labour government, we were not only welcoming people to come into this country to work, we were sending out search parties for people and encouraging them, in some cases, to take up work in this country.” Mr Cleverly goes on to reference comments made by Yvette Cooper. In April 2016, she appeared on The Andrew Marr Show, saying “the pace of migration, as a result of not having immigration controls and transitional controls, was too fast”. In 2015, when she appeared on a Channel 4 News debate between prospective Labour leaders, Ms Cooper said: “If every local council, every city across the country took 10 refugee families, that would add up to nearly 10,000 places for vulnerable refugees.” She added the final number would depend on how many areas came forward. Regarding Mr Cleverly’s final claim, Sir Keir Starmer did call for freedom of movement to be maintained with the European Union in 2020, albeit then ruling this out in 2022. Responsibility for immigration to the UK ultimately lies with the Home Office, which is currently led by Mr Cleverly, a Conservative. Labour has not been in charge of the Home Office since it was last in government, in 2010. Freedom of movement between EU countries and the UK – which prior to Brexit meant no restrictions on living and working – has not been reinstated by the Government and has not been promised by either of the main parties in the run-up to the 2024 election. Ms Cooper lost the 2015 leadership contest, and her idea of asking councils to take in refugee families was also not introduced.

    "text": "The Book of Marvels Goes on Show at the Morgan\nThe Book of the Marvels of the World, an illustrated guide to the globe filled with oddities, curiosities, and wonders for the medieval armchair traveler will go on display at The Morgan Library & Museum tomorrow.\nRunning January 24 through May 25, The Book of Marvels: Imagining the Medieval World is at the center of the exhibition which brings together two of the four surviving copies of this rare text - one from the Morgan’s collection, the other from the J. Paul Getty Museum - to examine medieval conceptions and misconceptions of a global world.\nThe related works on display bring to life the world of the Book of Marvels. Together, these objects demonstrate how foreign cultures were imagined in the Middle Ages and what the assumptions of medieval Europeans reveal about their own beliefs and biases. The exhibition also features Persian and Ottoman manuscripts that engage the theme from a non-European perspective.\nAccounts of marvels were a primary way for pre-modern people across many cultures to learn about distant lands. Stretching the limits of imagination, these accounts often become increasingly fantastical the farther one travels from home. So in the description of Sri Lanka from the Book of Marvels, both text and image focus on the region’s massive snails which are said to be so large that locals live inside their shells and hunt them like wild game. Likewise, Arabia is depicted as a region rich in precious gems which are cut from the stomachs of dragons like pearls from oysters.\nIn Europe these accounts reinforced notions of cultural and religious superiority, often by characterizing other cultures as immoral or uncivilized.\n“This exhibition is an opportunity to exhibit and study the Morgan’s copy of the Book of the Marvels of the World, the most complete extant copy, while also examining its perspective on the global medieval world,” said Colin B. Bailey, Katharine J. Rayner Director of the Morgan Library & Museum.\"\nOther highlights iinclude:\n- rare illustrated manuscripts of Marco Polo and John Mandeville\n- a richly ornamented Ottoman Book of Wonders, made for a sultan’s daughter\n- a spectacular medieval map of the Holy Land, based on pilgrimage accounts; and one of the earliest European depictions of Native Americans\nIn summer 2024, a complementary show, The Book of Marvels: Wonder and Fear in the Middle Ages, was held at the J. Paul Getty Museum, where their copy and the Morgan’s copy of the Book of Marvels manuscripts were placed in conversation with objects from the Getty’s collection.",
