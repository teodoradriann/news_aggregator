    "title": "Speed unknown factor in death of Grizzly 1058, one of 399's offspring - WyoFile",
    "text": "A grizzly death attributed to a fatal vehicle strike has triggered an outpouring of rage on social media about people driving too fast, but law enforcement could not determine whether speed was a factor in the collision.\nThe bear that died, Grizzly 1058, is one of the famous “quads” of their even more famous mom, Grizzly 399 , who died last year after being fatally struck by a vehicle on a highway south of Jackson.\nIn the death of Grizzly 399, authorities ruled that the driver was not speeding .\nAs for Grizzly 1058, “law enforcement rangers were not able to determine if speed was a factor” in the collision, Grand Teton National Park spokeswoman Emily Davis said in an email Wednesday.\nNonetheless, park officials asked people to slow down and be vigilant for wildlife in a Tuesday news release confirming the bear’s death.\nWhile reducing speeds can help protect wildlife along Wyoming highways, it’s not the only factor setting the stage for fatal collisions.\n“It’s terribly unfortunate that this happened,” said Brian DeBolt, large carnivore conflict coordinator with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “But it’s becoming all too common with these bears that spend so much time roadside.”\nThe more time bears hang out near roads, the higher the probability that they’re going to be struck and killed by a vehicle, DeBolt said. Game and Fish is finding that younger bears, like the 5-year-old subadult found Tuesday, are being forced to make a living in more marginal habitat along roadsides because more prime habitat is already occupied.\nWhat park officials have confirmed so far is that Grizzly 1058 had been spotted in the park since he and his three siblings split from their mom in 2022. But there were no confirmed sightings of him this spring, the park release said.\nPark law enforcement found the bear’s remains Tuesday in a patch of willows about 125 yards from the highway, within park boundaries east of the Buffalo Fork River. The Jackson Hole News&Guide reported that a law enforcement ranger found the dead bear after spotting ravens and eagles scavenging along the highway and stopping to investigate. The park bear biologist told the News&Guide the animal had likely been there for several days.\nThe park relied on ear tags and a “PIT” tag to identify the 5-year-old bear, which the park release said “appeared to be in good condition for his age and the time of year.”\nMore to it than speed\nThe outer park highway sees more diverse traffic — including commuters and semis — and higher speed limits than the inner park road. Just up the highway on Togwotee Pass, where vehicles have struck roadside grizzlies , wildlife managers and law enforcement have struggled to manage traffic jams created by bear watchers.\nAs more bears live roadside, and get habituated to people, the more risk of collisions, DeBolt said Wednesday. “We don’t want bears to be so comfortable roadside,” he added.\nOnlookers gather to watch Grizzly 399 and her cub in May 2023. (NPS/C. Adams) The speed limit on Togwotee Pass is 55 miles per hour, but once drivers cross into Grand Teton National Park, there is a nighttime speed limit of 45 mph on that same highway. Safety concerns along that highway, where it crosses through the Bridger-Teton National Forest, prompted one retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent to propose a “grizzly bear speed limit,” using variable speed limits similar to how the state handles blizzards on the interstate.\n“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know, when the bears are around the highway,” said Steve Stoinski, a retired Fish and Wildlife Service agent who spent a summer managing bear traffic jams on Togwotee Pass.\nBut that speed limit would only work with regular enforcement, Stoinski told WyoFile.\nDeBolt said he’d be open to reducing speed limits if it would reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and was reasonable and logistically possible. But setting speed limits is not Game and Fish’s call to make. DeBolt also sees larger factors at play.\n“Although it seems like maybe a simple fix,” DeBolt said. “It’s not that simple.”\nInside Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks where reduced speed limits are enforced, wildlife still die in vehicle strikes, DeBolt said.\n“We need to look at what we can do to promote the safety of bears long-term,” DeBolt said. “From an agency standpoint, we’re trying to discourage them from even living roadside.”\nThat’s one reason Game and Fish has joined forces with multiple federal, state and local partners to proactively manage bear jams on Togwotee Pass , he said.\nPark law enforcement and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating this latest death.

    "text": "In the latest market close, Intuit (INTU) reached $589.02, with a +0.37% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.18%.

In that report, analysts expect Intuit to post earnings of $2.29 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 4.09%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.39 billion, up 11.36% from the year-ago period.\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $16.38 per share and a revenue of $16.04 billion, indicating changes of +13.75% and +11.63%, respectively, from the former year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Intuit.

    "text": "( [The Daily Signal](https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/12/21/catholic-all-girls-college-reverses-trans-policy-after-backlash/)) — [Saint Mary’s College](https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/11/22/catholic-all-girls-college-will-admit-men-identify-trans-women/) in Notre Dame, Indiana, is backtracking on its decision to allow men who identify as transgender women to enroll in the formerly all-female, Catholic institution. The Daily Signal reported in November that [Saint Mary’s College](https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/02/17/exclusive-st-marys-college-says-biological-sex-does-not-align-with-its-mission/) would allow men who identify as women to enroll at the college in the fall of 2024. That news was [first reported](https://ndsmcobserver.com/2023/11/saint-marys-approves-policy-to-consider-applicants-who-identify-as-women/) by the Notre Dame student newspaper, The Observer. In an email obtained by The Daily Signal on Thursday, President Katie Conboy addressed the outcry from both their community and alumnae since the decision. “This has weighed heavily on our minds and in our hearts,” she said in the email, sent around 11 a.m. on Thursday. “There have been many voices responding to us from many places and perspectives. We have listened closely, and we have heard each of you.” Conboy claimed the initial decision was viewed as a “reflection of our College’s commitment to live our Catholic values as a loving and just community” — but said that it is “increasingly clear” that “the position we took is not shared by all members of our community.” She wrote: “Some worried that this was much more than a policy decision: they felt it was a dilution of our mission or even a threat to our Catholic identity. Moreover, we clearly underestimated our community’s genuine desire to be engaged in the process of shaping a policy of such significance. As this last month unfolded, we lost people’s trust and unintentionally created division where we had hoped for unity. For this, we are deeply sorry.” “Taking all these factors into consideration, the Board has decided that we will return to our previous admission policy,” she said. “Although this has been a challenging time for our community, we believe that the College should continually grapple with the complexity of living our Catholic values in a changing world.” Members of the [Saint Mary’s community](https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/02/17/exclusive-st-marys-college-says-biological-sex-does-not-align-with-its-mission/) rejoiced over the news to The Daily Signal, expressing strong excitement that the college had backed down. “I’m so proud of the women at Saint Mary’s who were willing to stand up against this anti-women, anti-Catholic policy,” said Claire Bettag, a junior at Saint Mary’s. “God’s truth will always win.” “When this admissions decision became public hundreds of alumni banded together to stand for the Church and her teachings,” said Clare Ath, who graduated from the college in 2018. “While I would hope the reversal is because administrators realized we must teach the truth with love, my guess is the reversal is because alumni banded together, pulled their donations, notified their diocese and media, and said we will not let Our Lady’s college be corrupted by secular gender ideology.” Amanda Fischer, who graduated in 2020, expressed gratitude to Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend for the role he played in helping Saint Mary’s reverse its decision. “In addition to the overwhelming amount of negative backlash from current Saint Mary’s students, parents, alumnae, and beyond, I believe Bishop Rhoades’ [statement](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftodayscatholic.org%2Fsaint-marys-compromising-its-identity-as-a-catholic-womans-college%2F&data=05%7C02%7CMaryMargaret.Olohan%40heritage.org%7C5957233a10a0406e965c08dc0258f525%7Ccbd93b4867ea46759ee84178b273204a%7C0%7C0%7C638387828322472633%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=BWk6j6%2FJOvpZUb%2BLZwub0yhM3dkAg3M8a0dwmP0%2Fx0o%3D&reserved=0) regarding the change in admission policy and his meeting with President Conboy, which allegedly occurred on December 12th (the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe), all amounted to President Conboy and the Board of Trustees’ decision to return to the previous admission policy,” she told The Daily Signal. “I am edified by Bishop Rhoades’ shepherdly intervention, which quite frankly was needed at Saint Mary’s a long time ago.” The news was also celebrated by Catholic leaders who keep an eye on institutions that profess to be Catholic. “This is a very smart reversal and welcome affirmation of the need to protect the purpose and integrity of a Catholic college for women,” said Brian Burch, the president of Catholic Vote. “There is nothing unjust or discriminatory about protecting women from men who seek to redefine biological reality.” “To be Catholic is to acknowledge the truth about ourselves, including the unique and complementary roles of men and women,” he added. “Those that seek to blur these truths must be resisted. Saint Mary’s College is to be commended for their return to sanity.” “This is such welcome news in this season when we celebrate Christ, Wisdom become true man, and Mary, true woman and true Mother of the Son of God,” added Patrick Reilly, president and founder of The Cardinal Newman Society, which recognizes colleges that are determined to provide a thoroughly faithful Catholic education. “This is the truth which is the foundation of Catholic education and not ‘the complexity of living our Catholic values in a changing world.’” Rhoades, who oversees the Catholic churches and institutions within the diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, had strongly urged the Catholic college to rethink its decision. “It is disappointing that I, as bishop of the diocese in which Saint Mary’s College is located, was not included or consulted on a matter of important Catholic teaching,” he [said in a Nov. 27 statement](https://todayscatholic.org/saint-marys-compromising-its-identity-as-a-catholic-womans-college/), warning: “In this new admissions policy, Saint Mary’s departs from fundamental Catholic teaching on the nature of woman and thus compromises its very identity as a Catholic woman’s college.” “To call itself a ‘women’s college’ and to admit male students who ‘consistently live and identify as women’ suggests that the college affirms an ideology of gender that separates sex from gender and claims that sexual identity is based on the subjective experience of the individual,” he continued. “This ideology is at odds with Catholic teaching,” he added, before quoting Pope Francis. “In his apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis wrote: ‘It needs to be emphasized that ‘biological sex and the socio-cultural role of sex (gender) can be distinguished but not separated.’ It is one thing to be understanding of human weakness and the complexities of life, and another to accept ideologies that attempt to sunder what are inseparable aspects of reality. Let us not fall into the sin of trying to replace the Creator. We are creatures, and not omnipotent. Creation is prior to us and must be received as a gift.” Rhoades had concluded: “The desire of Saint Mary’s College to show hospitality to people who identify as transgender is not the problem. The problem is a Catholic woman’s college embracing a definition of woman that is not Catholic.”",

    "text": "Trabalhadores da Amazon param o mundo. Greves e protestos em mais de 20 países marcam o fim de semana da Black Friday Por Executive Digest 07:10, 29 Nov 2024 partilhar Os trabalhadores da Amazon em mais de 20 países, irão realizar greves e protestos entre a Black Friday, a 29 de novembro, e a Cyber Monday, a 2 de dezembro. A iniciativa é liderada pela UNI Global Union, uma organização sindical com sede na Suíça, e pela Progressive International, um grupo político de base, com o objetivo de chamar a atenção para as alegadas “práticas antidemocráticas e antitrabalhistas” da gigante tecnológica.\nDe acordo com os organizadores, os protestos irão decorrer em várias cidades dos EUA, Brasil, Alemanha, Japão e Reino Unido.\nOs protestos coincidem estrategicamente com um dos fins de semana mais movimentados do ano para o comércio, quando os consumidores aproveitam para antecipar as compras de Natal.\nA sindicalização tem sido uma batalha constante nos armazéns da Amazon nos EUA. Em 2022, uma instalação em Staten Island tornou-se a primeira — e até agora a única — a formar um sindicato. No entanto, outros esforços em estados como Alabama e Nova Iorque falharam nos últimos anos.\nEste será o quinto ano consecutivo de protestos contra a Amazon durante a Black Friday. Em ações anteriores, os trabalhadores chegaram a manifestar-se em frente à residência de Jeff Bezos em Nova Iorque, no distrito de Flatiron.\npartilhar",

    "text": "22 February 2024, 20:20\nLawyers dispute on proportionality of punishment requested for Zhuravel for burning Koran\nThe punishment of 3.5 years in a penal colony, requested by the prosecutor for Nikita Zhuravel, a native of Volgograd, accused of burning the Koran, is severe by the standards of the Russian law enforcement practice; and the prosecution has incorrectly qualified the defendant's actions, Alexander Verkhovsky believes.\nThe \"Caucasian Knot\" has reported that with account of the current conditions in Chechnya, human rights defenders doubted Zhuravel's testimonies about the burning of the Koran. Lawyers have stressed that Zhuravel's confession could be based on the hope to earn the court's leniency, but his words that he had acted not alone could make the crime qualification more serious.\nThe prison term requested by the prosecutor doesn't look very severe by Russian practices, but the very qualification of the charges raises questions, said Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of the SOVA Information and Analytical Centre*.\n\"The problem here is that the charge elements mismatch the offence gravity ... Part 2 of Article 148 (public actions aimed at insulting religious feelings, committed at a worship place, – note of the \"Caucasian Knot\") is applied is when an action was committed in a church, mosque or near them, but it didn't happen nearby at all. The Koran is not a place, but a subject,\" Mr Verkhovsky has clarified, adding that formally, \"for a person who commits a crime for the first time, there is no reason to request the maximum sentence.\"\nThe term requested by the prosecutor for Zhuravel is quite severe, taking into account the current practices in Russia, the expert has noted. He sees political factors that will prevail over legal ones in this case.\nThe prison term was requested by the prosecutor within the framework of established practices, and also with account of the fact that Zhuravel is in the dock for the first time, Miki Arapiev, a lawyer of the Moscow Bar Association, has stated. He also believes that the court may increase the punishment, despite the position of the state prosecution.\n*Included by the Russian Ministry of Justice (MoJ) into the register of foreign agents.\nThis article was originally published on the Russian page of 24/7 Internet agency ‘Caucasian Knot’ on February 21, 2024 at 03:50 am MSK.

    "title": "Archbishop Gallagher: In a world cloaked in darkness, let’s be builders of peace",
    "text": "Archbishop Gallagher: In a world cloaked in darkness, let’s be builders of peace By Adriana Masotti As part of his three-day visit to Croatia, the Vatican Secretary for Relations with States and International Organizations, Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, presided over Mass on 31 May marking the Feast of Our Lady of the Stone Gate, patron saint of Zagreb. In the homily, he invited the faithful to grasp God's work even amid today's many difficulties and \"destructions,\" just as the Virgin Mary and her cousin Elizabeth did, who believed and hoped before seeing the fulfilment of God's promises. Our Lady, source of hope Archbishop Gallagher recalled that the image of Our Lady of the Stone Gate emerged intact from the ruins of the gate at the eastern entrance to the ancient city of Zagreb, following a fire. For its \"afflicted and disoriented\" inhabitants this was a source of amazement and hope. \"Today, in the world there is no shortage of scenes of tragic destruction,\" the archbishop said, some caused by natural phenomena, but also \"by that human senselessness that Pope Francis has long defined as 'world war three fought piecemeal' which is turning into a 'global conflict.'\" Therefore, he added, it is important to look again at that image. God's gift of life Archbishop Gallagher reflected on the message of the reading for the liturgy that tells of the encounter between Mary and Elizabeth, both unexpectedly future mothers and highlighted how motherhood disrupts their plans but is welcomed with joy. And turning his thoughts to today's mothers he said: \"May Our Lady of the Stone Gate accompany all those women who receive in their wombs the seed of a new life, even when it comes unexpectedly,\" and may they see it as \"a gift from God.\" He continued that this does not always happen in our societies, but for believers, life must always be promoted and defended. Go forth! The Gospel says of Mary that \"she arose and went quickly\" to visit her cousin Elizabeth. Mary thus becomes the image of that \"outgoing Church\" so desired by the Pope. \"May she be a model for us as well,\" reiterated Archbishop Gallagher. \"May the Lord give us the strength to rise, go out, and meet those who suffer the consequences of adverse fate or human malice. Let us rise, quickly. We cannot remain idle. There is an urgent need to console the afflicted, encourage the desperate, and be peacemakers,” he said. Paschal hope Elizabeth and her husband Zechariah had waited for years for the gift of a child: \"They had perhaps given up hope\" when the Lord listened to their prayer, fulfilling their hope. In Mary's \"yes\" to God's will and in Elizabeth's transformation of resignation into joy, lies the logic of Easter. \"When we know how to give up our plans to abandon ourselves to the Creator's will, whether happy or sad, it is the Paschal mystery that works in us and reveals itself in all its power,\" the archbishop emphasized. Solidarity Mary and Elizabeth praise the Lord not when everything happens according to their desire, but in the certainty that God will fulfill his promises. This is an invitation for us, he said, \"to see God's work already present in the world, albeit in embryo.\" Archbishop Gallagher invited believers to open their eyes, for example, to the solidarity that arises every time in the face of a tragedy or \"human ferocity.\" \"Let us not only look at the bombs that fall and the destruction they bring,\" he said. \"The Lord, as he preserved Our Lady of the Stone Gate, always saves the good, a small flock, which sometimes becomes large, like the army of those who risk their lives to relieve the pain of victims or to prevent new tragedies.\" Builders of peace We need the perspective of the two protagonists of today's liturgy, the archbishop said, \"to see God's work already in action, amid the 'wickedness of the world.'\" To Our Lady of the Stone Gate, invoked in Croatia as the \"beginning of a better world\" as Saint John Paul II recalled during his visit to the country 30 years ago, Gallagher prayed for the gift of patience for everyone. \"As She revealed herself as a sign of hope during a tragedy,\" he concluded, \"may she also make us witnesses of the resurrection, despite everything, to praise God with our lives and to be, even now, in a world cloaked in darkness, beacons of light and builders of peace.\" Thank you for reading our article.
