    "text": "Residents of Alva are voicing concerns over new housing developments, fearing it will mean fewer horses and more houses in their rural community.\nSue Coffman and Amy Gagnon took to the streets of downtown Fort Myers on horseback to express their opposition to a zoning application by Neal Communities to develop nearly 800 acres of land in Alva.\n“To show our solidarity in believing that we need places to ride, places to live, places to raise our children in the country, not in concrete cities,” said Coffman. “He’s a big horse. He’s here. No, it takes a lot of property to raise these guys and to feed them.”\nBill Redfern was among the first to speak out against the development during a meeting with Lee County commissioners.\n“This development is totally inappropriate to the area. It does not fit in with our lifestyle; this commission has taken it upon itself to totally ignore the community,” said Redfern.\nDespite the opposition, commissioners reviewed and approved the application, allowing Neal Communities to build 1,100 homes on 788 acres.\n“It’s important to be heard. We want to listen to what you say, but we can’t opine about how we feel about the law,” said Lee County Commissioner David Mulicka. “We have to follow the law, and that’s hard for people to understand.”\nPat Neal, founder of Neal Communities, wants residents, especially those with horses or land nearby, to know their concerns are being considered.\n“If you’re driving along North River Road, there’ll be this huge buffer,” said Neal. “I feel that people will not even be aware of the homes because of the setback and the creation of the new native habitat, so we think it’s a win-win for the community, and we’ll work with the neighbors from now until forever.”\nNeal mentioned that it will take two to four years before any development begins. Once completed, the population of the area, currently around 3,000 people, is expected to nearly double.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON – Equitable Food Initiative, the capacity-building and certification organization that partners with growers, farmworkers, retailers and consumer groups, is pleased to announce three upcoming sustainability offerings.\nFirst, EFI is excited to premiere a new video: “Agriculture is Climate Work.” This video highlights the achievements of the Produce & Reduce pilot program on GoodFarms’ Santa Maria operation. The film beautifully engages all the senses and brings viewers up close to the work of harvesting strawberries. It also showcases the specific steps undertaken to reduce waste and the program’s impressive results. The premiere of this film will be held during a LinkedIn live event on April 11 at 1 pm PDT on EFI’s page.\nSecond, inspired by the success of the Produce & Reduce pilot program, EFI remains committed to assisting fresh produce grower-shippers to integrate sustainable practices into their operations. Following an industry-wide needs assessment, EFI developed “Sustainability 101,” a three-day virtual course that supports companies in coordinating and articulating their sustainability initiatives. That needs assessment revealed that 90% of surveyed companies identified internal coordination of sustainability efforts and effectively reporting those efforts to customers as their primary challenges.\n“Sustainability 101 will cover everything that needs to happen in the company to embed sustainability into their business in meaningful ways,” said Lilian Autler, climate and workforce development manager for EFI. “It will also help address the most commonly cited need for growers-shippers to report those efforts to customers.” The Sustainability 101 course will be held on May 15, 16 & 21 from 10 am – 1 pm PDT. Interested attendees can find other details and a registration link at\nequitablefood.org/seminars.\nFinally, on May 14 at 11 am PDT/ 2 pm ET, EFI will be offering a free webinar titled ‘How to Put Sustainability at the Heart of Your Brand,’ featuring learnings from the newly released Author Maisie Ganzler, a founding board member of EFI, drawing on three decades of experience leading a $1.7 billion corporation toward a more sustainable future. Ganzler will share applicable lessons for fresh produce companies as they develop and share their sustainable practices. She is currently releasing her new book “You Can’t Market Manure at Lunchtime: And Other Lessons from the Food Industry for Creating a More Sustainable Company.”\nAbout EFI\nEquitable Food Initiative is a capacity-building and certification nonprofit that works to improve the lives of farmworkers and drive business performance by integrating worker voice and engagement throughout the supply chain. As a multistakeholder organization, EFI brings together growers, farmworkers, retailers and consumers to create assessment, training and organizational development programs that support continuous improvement and address the industry’s most pressing problems.

    "text": "There is nothing I hate more than my time being wasted, and Elrentaros Wanderings has now given me trust issues when it comes to trying games made by Hakama.\nIf there is one thing I despise, it is having my time wasted. Some games are meant to be time wasters, and some pose as engaging but are hollow. Hakama has made one of the most engaging Rune Factory games, but its recent offering of Elrentaros Wanderings is a giant hollow step in the wrong direction. Nothing is enticing or rewarding in this game, which begs the question: why play it at all? It’s a simple answer really — you shouldn’t.\nElrentaros Wanderings ‘ story has a lot wrong with it. The game begins with the protagonist (either a boy or a girl) waking up in the town of Elrentaros. They have no memory of getting there and the only clue to their past is a mirror with slots for gemstones to be placed in. While townspeople do not fully trust the main character, this amnesiac stranger is immediately tasked with saving a resident trapped in a nearby cave. After saving the resident, the player is then whisked away to another world with a more modern high school setting, and all the people they have met in Elrentaros are there, but they can’t quite remember which world is the one they came from.\nLook at all those numbers!\nThe game’s story is a convoluted mess full of amnesia tropes and plays out like a bad isekai anime. Every character lacks personality and feels one note, which makes questioning them to raise their relationship feel like such a chore. Many of the characters in town are uninteresting, and it doesn’t help how dry the translation is. Some of the character dialogue is stilted, almost unnatural, when reading it aloud. It also struggles to land the core story beat of parallel worlds because these characters feel generic and don’t have an interesting narrative to tell. A story that features parallel worlds should be mysterious and the player should want to put the pieces together, but this game struggles with making the narrative kernels worth even picking up.\nWorse off is the fact that this is a game all about repetition. The protagonist will go into a dungeon, and based on their build level — which is what level their gear is at — and go through each stage multiple times. Gear can be mixed and matched, though the math of how the game determines build level feels muddy. Equipment is mainly found in the dungeons and if completed, the player can keep whatever gear was discovered during the run. However, the issue arises that having to repeat the same dungeons over and over again, players will often end up with piles of useless junk that end up taking up space. While there is an unlimited inventory, wading through to find the perfect item is painful, to say the least.\nToo much junk, not enough usefulness.\nWhy do players have to repeat dungeons over and over again? Well, that’s one of the game’s failings. It doesn’t have a good reason as to why players have to constantly repeat dungeons. The game reasons that the town residents will have quests for the protagonist to complete, but the player doesn’t find out what those are until the dungeon has been completed one time. Each of the game’s dungeons also has different difficulty levels, which require players to repeat a dungeon until they have gear close enough to the dungeon’s recommended level. While the dungeons are not long, they are dull wastes of time with very little to interact with, and many of the quests have dumb arbitrary factors, like “don’t get hit by an enemy that causes the darkness status effect”, while starting the run surrounded by enemies that cause darkness. How can one avoid that if the solution to doing the dungeon at a higher level is just to throw more enemies at the player? It’s poor design and the rewards are often so meaningless, that going through the dungeons over and over again has no real value other than to waste time.\nThe combat also struggles in the realm of repetition. For a basic attack, players only have to hold one button. Even worse while there are multiple weapon types, they all play the same. The combat feels like an afterthought, much like the entirety of the game’s design. While players can upgrade weapons to gain new skills or give gifts to the villagers which also provide mostly passive skills, it still requires constantly repeating the same uninspired content. Even the music and voice work is forgettable. It’s hard to find anything positive other than, “I guess the character art is kind of cute.”\nI admit, I always like to go down with a sinking ship in my reviews. However, this game wasted too much of my time and I found the game genuinely offensive for its lack of respect for the effort I was putting in. This game is disguised as a “cozy isekai ” but fails both areas spectacularly. Elrentaros Wanderings ’s greatest sin is how boring everything about it is, and how unremarkable and bland the gameplay and story are. There is nothing I hate more than my time being wasted, and Elrentaros Wanderings has now given me trust issues when it comes to trying games made by Hakama.\nDisclosure: This article is based on a build/copy of the game provided by the publisher.",

    "text": "[Alemania](/cronologia/-/meta/alemania) Una locura se ha vivido este jueves en el BayArena. El Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso estuvo al borde del precipicio, a unos minutos de perder su largo invicto, pero dos goles del checo Patrik Schick en el tiempo de descuento evitó su eliminación y le dio una agónica remontada 3-2 contra el modesto FK Qarabag de Azerbaiyán para clasificar a cuartos de final de la UEFA Europa League. El conjunto alemán estaba viendo frenada su racha de 36 partidos seguidos (37 con el de hoy) sin perder que llevaba hasta ahora, teniendo en cuenta todas las competiciones, algo que ningún club alemán de la élite había conseguido antes. Con la victoria de hoy, el balance es de 32 triunfos y 5 empates. El humilde club originario de la región del Nagorno-Karabaj de Azerbaiyán ya había sorprendió en la ida cuando se adelantó 2-0 en el marcador y el Bayer Leverkusen rescató el agónico empate en los últimos minutos del encuentro en Bakú. Este jueves en el BayArena, la historia se volvió a repetir. El FK Qarabag tomó la ventaja con un cabezazo del extremo francés Abdellah Zoubir tras un centro desde la banda derecha, en el minuto 58. En el 63’, el árbitro inglés Anthony Taylor mostró una rigurosa tarjeta roja al defensa azerbaiyano Elvin Jafarguliyev por una leve agarrón contra Jeremie Frimpong cuando el neerlandés se escapaba solo en dirección a portería visitante. Pese a estar con un hombre menos en la cancha, el FK Qarabag no se achicó en campo alemán y silenció el BayArena con el 0-2, obra del delantero brasileño Juninho después de un buen pase del montenegrino Marko Vesović, en el 67’. Se metió en el partido el Bayer Leverkusen con la anotación de Jeremie Frimpong, llegando a empujar un centro del español Alejandro Grimaldo en el minuto 72. Se llegaba al tiempo del descuento y el cuadro de Xabi Alonso estaba diciendo adiós a la competición continental. El sílbante añadió seis minutos al segundo tiempo e incluso dejó jugar más tiempo, que fue cuando los alemanes remontaron. En el minuto 92, Patrik Schick cazó barriendose un centro al primer palo para mandar la pelota al fondo de las mallas, con agonía ya que el portero del FK Qarabag alcanzó a tocarla, pero no lo suficiente para evitar el tanto. Y en el 97’, el delantero checo obró el milagro con un cabezazo en el segundo poste tras un gran centro del argentino Exequiel Palacios.",

    "title": "Murder charge: Man shot wife, captured in western Wisconsin with his 2 kids as he reached for rifle",
    "text": "A man suspected of fatally shooting his wife evaded capture with his two children along until police arrested him outside a western Wisconsin gas station just as he was reaching for a gun in his pickup truck, according to charges. Jared Danger Ler'che, 41, of rural Osceola, Wis., was charged Wednesday with first-degree intentional homicide in connection with the shooting of 34-year-old Margaret Ler'che on Monday just over the border with Minnesota in the southwest corner of Polk County. Ler'che appeared in Circuit Court on Wednesday and remains jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail. He's due back in court on Tuesday. Court records indicate that Ler'che does not yet have an attorney. According to the criminal complaint: On Monday, the father of Margaret Ler'che called the Sheriff's Office asking for a deputy to check on his daughter at her home near Osecola. He said she was supposed to pack up her belongings and arrive at his home in Iowa, where she and the children had been living in recent months because of marital problems. Shortly after 8:50 p.m. that same day, St. Paul police alerted Polk County law enforcement that Jared Ler'che called a Minnesota crisis center and said he was driving around with his two children and having thoughts of suicide. St. Paul police tracked his phone to south of the Twin Cities in Cannon Falls. About 45 minutes later, deputies arived at the Ler'che home on 240th Street south of Osceola and knocked on the door. Jared Ler'che replied through a doorbell app even though he was not inside. Ler'che and one of the deputies connected by phone and said he didn't know Margaret Ler'che's whereabouts. The call ended after Jared Ler'che had nothing more to say. Around 11:25 p.m., a deputy connected again with Jared Ler'che through the doorbell app, and he repeated that he knew nothing about where Margaret Ler'che might be. He declined to say where he was, other than to say in Minnesota. He did offer that he \"was not feeling good about this\" and had an idea about why the deputies were in touch with him, but he said nothing more. Jared Ler'che eventually agreed to meet law enforcement at a KwikTrip in Osceola. About the same time, deputies went to the home, entered and spotted dried blood on a basement stairwell wall. They went down and saw Margaret Ler'che's body beneath a blanket, with a charging cord wrapped around her neck. A gunshot wound to the back of her head was visible. A rifle was on the floor next to her. Investigators arrived at the KwikTrip and parked next to Ler'che's pickup truck. His children were in car seats behind him. He explained that he believed his wife was having multiple affairs and involved in illegal sexual enterprises. He gave vague answers about his where his wife was and kept trying to change the subject. Ler'che balked at going back to his home with law enforcement, at times reaching for something near the floor and soon had \"a state of panic\" on his face as he locked the door to his vehicle. Eventually, investigators got the pickup unlocked as Ler'che was again reaching for something near his feet. Once Ler'che was in handcuffs, an investigator saw a shotgun on the floor. Seized from Ler'che were footwear and clothing with blood spatter.",

    "title": "B.C. First Nation, Catholic Church announce 'Sacred Covenant' to be signed on Easter",
    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic archdiocese is marking Easter with a commitment towards reconciliation with First Nations in B.C., Archbishop J. Michael Miller says. The church and the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc announced Thursday that a \"Sacred Covenant\" agreement has been reached between the church and the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C.The covenant comes three years after the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., announced the discovery of what it believed were the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school.Miller said the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C. \"Unquestionably, the church was wrong in implementing a government colonialist policy which resulted in devastation for many children, families and communities. We recognize as Catholics, as the Catholic Church, our part in the resulting tragedies,\" Miller said.The covenant is set to be signed on Easter Sunday, \"a special time of hope and renewal,\" Miller said. \"Easter Sunday is the ideal time to help start a new chapter in First Nation and Catholic relations in our province,\" he said. \"Our hope and our prayer is that by taking this next step, we will build on our relationship, a relationship already established but still young, and be an example to Canadian society of respecting the identity and the experience of Indigenous Peoples.\" Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc said the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing. Casimir said the agreement is crucial to learning the truth about what happened to the missing children, and access to the church's historical records will help \"bring justice to the children who never made it home.\" \"We seek to memorialize the missing children. We also seek meaningful ways to support survivors and intergenerational survivors on their healing journey so that they and their future generations may thrive,\" she said. The nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found 200 potential unmarked burial sites.Since then, First Nations across the country have conducted searches and made similar discoveries. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified at least 6,000 deaths at residential schools during their time in operation in Canada between the late 1800s and 1996. In many of the deaths, schools didn’t record the children's names, genders or cause of death. The children in the schools were separated from their families and forbidden to speak their own language. They were undernourished and often experienced physical and sexual abuse. The agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and offering \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school. Casimir said the possible excavation of the Kamloops school site has not begun as it's a \"very sensitive step moving forward,\" that involves work with other nations, survivors and their families.
