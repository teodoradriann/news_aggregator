    "text": "Highlights\n- WiseTech Global (WTC) reshuffles its board amid recent stock performance momentum.\n- Two new non-executive directors appointed, while two existing members step down.\n- Shares dip following the announcement after a strong multi-week rally.\nShares of logistics software provider WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) edged lower in early trading following a key boardroom update. The company, part of the ASX200 stocks, announced the resignation of two non-executive directors and the simultaneous appointment of two new members to the board, prompting investor reactions and a momentary shift in sentiment.\nAs of 10:40am AEST, WiseTech Global’s stock was trading at AUD 107.06, reflecting a decline of 1.72% from the previous session. This minor pullback comes after an impressive rally of over 40% since early April, signaling a phase of notable optimism surrounding the company's operational performance and outlook.\nThe boardroom transition includes the addition of experienced industry professionals poised to bring fresh perspectives and governance capabilities to the company. The outgoing directors had served significant terms and contributed to shaping the firm’s strategic roadmap. With the appointment of the new directors, WiseTech appears to be reinforcing its commitment to sustainable leadership and strategic evolution in a competitive global logistics tech landscape.\nWhile the change in board composition did trigger a temporary dip in share price, this kind of leadership update often sparks a recalibration in the market, as investors digest the implications on the firm’s trajectory. Corporate governance, especially within ASX200 listed firms, plays a vital role in maintaining investor trust and long-term stability.\nThe company’s strong run over the past two months had positioned it among standout performers on the ASX. The recent momentum reflects broader confidence in WiseTech’s logistics and supply chain digitalisation platform, which serves enterprise-level clients globally. However, governance updates—particularly involving multiple board seats—tend to introduce a short-term layer of uncertainty, which is reflected in market response.\nAs part of the ASX200 stocks, WiseTech continues to remain a significant name in Australia's tech landscape. For those tracking broader market movements and corporate activity across the top 200 Australian-listed entities, this development offers a relevant case study in how board dynamics can influence sentiment.\nWhile the near-term price reaction shows softness, the strategic significance of such changes may unfold more clearly as the company progresses under refreshed leadership.",

    "text": "20 Riot Police Sent to Remove 10 Young People Praying Rosary at Abortion Facility in Spain On Dec. 28, the feast of the Holy Innocents, the officers also arrested Dr. Jesús Poveda, who was staging a one-man sit-in at the doors of the Dator facility. The Government Delegation (public administration) in Madrid mobilized approximately 20 riot police officers to prevent about 10 young people from praying the rosary in front of the Dator abortion facility. On Dec. 28, the feast of the Holy Innocents, the officers also arrested Dr. Jesús Poveda, who was staging a one-man sit-in at the doors of the Dator facility.The doctor has spent close to 40 years helping mothers at risk of abortion. Poveda was thus faithful to what already constitutes a tradition of the pro-life movement in Spain by carrying out an act of passive resistance on only one day of the year, the feast of the Holy Innocents, while dedicating the remaining 364 to saving babies. In the early hours of Thursday morning, unidentified people affixed posters to the Dator facility [with explicit images](https://twitter.com/JaumeVivesVives/status/1740281778395566476?s=20) of aborted babies with messages such as “He is a holy innocent” and “Are you going to look the other way?” At 9 a.m. sharp, Poveda went to the doors of the abortion center and sat down on the ground in protest near the facility doors. Shortly after, a group of young people from the [Praying Is Not a Crime](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/250911/spain-criminalizes-pro-life-witness-near-abortion-clinics) movement arrived at the scene with the intention of meditating on the luminous mysteries of the rosary. Several police officers automatically made them move a hundred meters (about 330 feet) away from the place, where on their knees and displaying a large wooden cross and an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, they began to pray the rosary. Next to them was a woman carrying a sign with the usual message of the 40 Days for Life initiative: “You are not alone, we can help you.” Some of the young people explained to ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, that the officers just told them that there was another event scheduled and notice given to the Government Delegation, and that was why they had to move away from the place. Pro-lifers claimed that, according to the law, they did not constitute a demonstration since there were fewer than 20 people in their group. While this was going on, a group of fewer than 10 feminists came onto the scene with the plan to demonstrate at the site, as they have done regularly for a few years. Around the place they displayed posters with slogans such as “keep your rosaries off our ovaries,” “feminist struggle = trans struggle,” and “I too aborted. So what!” while they used a loudspeaker to play music that could be heard all down the street. At about 9:30 in the morning, the officers told Poveda to leave the place near the doors of the abortion facility, which he refused to do, offering passive resistance. The police then transferred him to a patrol car in which he was taken to the police station. Throughout the hour that the pro-life volunteers were at the scene, the police didn’t allow them to freely move about and they were followed by several officers. At least one man was told by a police officer [to empty his pockets](https://www.aciprensa.com/videos/dator28d-bolsillos-nc.mp4), although he finally allowed him to continue without further consequences. Another time, when two of the pro-life volunteers came to store material at the pro-life shelter located near the abortion business, several of the feminists made a beeline toward them carrying a banner. The police prevented them from approaching, warning the abortion advocates that [they were seeking “confrontation](https://www.aciprensa.com/videos/dator-28d-policia-feministas-confrontan-nc-231228.mp4)” with the young pro-life women. This was not the only rosary planned for this day. At 6:30 p.m. several organizations were to gather at the site with the same intention. Also expected to attend was José Andrés Calderón, the young organizer of the public rosaries for the unity of Spain, which has been going on for almost 50 days. - Keywords: [church in spain](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/church-in-spain) [global rosary](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/global-rosary)",
