    "text": "Di María, en una foto de archivo con el Benfica. EFE/EPA/FILIPE AMORIM El Club América busca tener su bombazo durante el verano, intentando no quedarse atrás en los distintos refuerzos que ha llegado a la Liga Mx y el nombre que más fuerza ha tomado es el de Ángel Di Maria , futbolista argentino campeón del Mundo en 2022, quien juga para Benfica, siendo el nuevo patrocinador de los azulcremas el que ayudaría en la negociación.\nLas Águilas planean traer a un jugador de renombre que ayude a vender las playeras, como lo ha sido Sergio Ramos con Rayados y James Rodríguez con León, por lo que podrían lograr el fichaje de otro ex Real Madrid , como lo es “El Fideo” Di María, jugador de 37 años que se encuentra jugando en Portugal.\nDe acuerdo con información del medio portugués A Bola , el tricampeón de la Liga Mx planea hacer una fuerte inversión para convencer al argentino de dejar Europa y venir a la Liga Mx , algo para lo que tendrían respaldo de Adidas , quien será su nuevo patrocinador a partir del próximo verano.\nCabe recordar que Ángel Di María termina contrato con Benfica el próximo 30 de junio, por lo que América podría negociarlo como agente libre, teniendo que negociar solamente su salario. Según datos de la misma fuente, las Águilas le ofrecerían un sueldo anual de USD 3 millones , algo que lo convertiría en uno de los mejores pagados en México.\nAunque también se menciona que el atacante tiene la posibilidad de aumentar su estancia en Portugal por un año más, basado en su contrato, por lo que esto podría detener todo. Sin embargo, parece que Adidas se encuentra involucrado en el tema, siguiendo de cerca las negociaciones, incluso están dispuestos a pagar una parte del salario del jugador para poder traerlo a Coapa.\nPor el momento, solo se mantiene como un rumor, ya que los azulcremas primero tienen que resolver el tema con sus cupos de extranjeros, ya que tienen todas las plazas ocupadas, pero tienen el próximo mercado para que se presenten algunas bajas. Además, tienen que esperar a conocer la decisión del futbolista antes de iniciar cualquier negociación.\nEl portal Transfermarkt tiene valorado a Ángel Di María en USD 3 millone s, precio que tendría que pagar América en caso de que el futbolista decida renovar contrato con Benfica, un valor que parece considerable de pagar, aunque ahí cambiaría el tema con el salario.",

    "text": "【环球时报综合报道】日本观光厅最新调查暴露了旅游体验痛点——“找不到垃圾桶” 持续成为访日游客心头之患。\n据《今日日本》6日报道，这项调查在2024年12月至2025年1月期间进行，在日本北海道新千岁、成田、羽田、关西和福冈五大机场对超过4000名准备离境的游客发起了问卷调研。结果显示，21.9%的受访外国游客将“垃圾桶太少”列为旅行中最受困扰的事。尽管这一比例比前一年下降了约8%，但“带着垃圾游日本”已成常态，不少游客戏称自己被迫开启“负重旅行”，直到返回旅馆才能卸下垃圾“包袱”。\n有专家表示，日本过去在公共区域设置的垃圾桶数量可观。然而，受1995年东京地铁沙林毒气袭击、2004年马德里列车爆炸案等恐怖袭击事件的影响，出于公共安全考量，大量垃圾桶被陆续撤除。这一举措虽在一定程度上提升了公共场所的安全性，却也导致游客聚集地乱扔垃圾现象日益严重。负责在公共场所安装太阳能垃圾桶的Forcetec公司的社长竹村阳平介绍称，“纽约和巴黎等城市约设置3万个公共垃圾桶，而在东京，由政府设置并维护的垃圾桶几乎消失不见，仅有私企安装和管理的垃圾桶零星分布”。针对这一现象，不少网民在社交平台留言称，“虽然这是一项面向游客的调查，但这也是许多日本民众的烦恼”。\n据报道，此次调查还暴露出其他服务短板。15.2% 的受访游客提到存在语言壁垒，餐厅等场所的工作人员英语水平较差，难以沟通；13.1% 的游客被热门景点的汹涌人潮“劝退”；更有不少游客抱怨，在机场办理入境手续时陷入漫长的排队“拉锯战”，消磨了旅行热情。（刘雅婷）",

    "text": "Read full article PA Media: UK News Sunak denies being ‘liar’ over £2,000 tax claim Nina Lloyd, PA Political Correspondent June 7, 2024 at 1:14 a.m. · 2 min read Link Copied\nRishi Sunak has denied Sir Keir Starmer’s accusations that he “lied” by saying Labour would hike taxes by £2,000 in claims criticised by the UK statistics watchdog.\nThe Prime Minister said the Labour leader was “obviously very rattled” after he repeatedly deployed the attack line during an ITV election debate earlier this week.\nMr Sunak had claimed that “independent Treasury officials” have costed Labour’s policies “and they amount to a £2,000 tax rise for everyone”.\nBut the Treasury’s permanent secretary James Bowler said ministers had been told not to suggest civil servants produced the figure.\nIn an interview published by ITV as the fallout deepened on Thursday, the Prime Minister said: “Keir Starmer and the Labour Party are obviously very rattled that we’ve exposed their plans to raise tax on people. And that’s what it, that’s what it demonstrates.”\nAsked whether the numbers were instead based on assumptions drawn up by Tory advisers, Mr Sunak said: “No. The analysis and the working is done by Treasury officials.”\nThe row stems from a document produced by the Conservatives which made a series of assumptions to estimate the cost that might be attached to potential Labour policies.\nIt said that Labour’s plans had a £38.5 billion deficit over four years, the equivalent of £2,094 for every working household, which the Tories claim would be filled with tax hikes.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Office for Statistics Regulation, which previously warned political parties to use figures appropriately during the campaign, suggested the Conservatives had failed to make clear their calculations.\n“Without reading the full Conservative Party costing document, someone hearing the claim would have no way of knowing that this is an estimate summed together over four years,” the statement read.\n“We warned against this practice a few days ago, following its use in presenting prospective future increases in defence spending.”\nSome of the estimated costings in the document were also produced by civil servants at the Treasury, using assumptions provided by politically appointed special advisers.\nBut Mr Bowler said the headline figure used by the Tories should not be attributed to impartial civil servants because it went beyond that official work.\nLabour says many of its policies will not cost anywhere near as much as the Conservatives suggested in their dossier.\nSir Keir has said the Prime Minister’s “made-up” claim had given an “insight into his character” and suggested he had broken the Ministerial Code by lying.\nThe party is set to agree on a final version of its manifesto on Friday at the closed-doors Clause V meeting of MPs, union representatives and members.\nD-Day commemorations meant that campaigning for the July 4 polling day momentarily took a backseat earlier on Thursday, with the Prime Minister addressing veterans in Normandy.",

    "title": "Growing clean electricity grid requires province, Ottawa",
    "text": "Thanks to its vast hydropower resources, Canada is already a clean energy superpower, blessed with 80 per cent non-emitting electricity. But delivering on that clean electricity advantage to fully power Canada’s clean energy transition and meet its emission goals is going to require building bigger, cleaner, smarter grids capable of doubling or tripling current capacity.\nIt’s a massive undertaking, one that will require governments to treat clean electricity like health care: a provincial responsibility with federal funding — and federal guardrails.\n×\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts This approach, which we’ve discussed before , has been dubbed electric federalism . Achieving it is going to require both ambition and compromise on both sides.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW For its part, the federal government is expected to more properly recognize provincial primacy with the coming release if its Clean Electricity Regulation. The feds are also readying more flexible terms of Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) for electricity.\nProvinces are also stepping up , but important gaps remain. While some provinces have written their climate goals into law, none have sufficiently aligned their climate and energy policies. This puts energy utilities and regulators in a tough spot when it comes to planning for a much different energy mix in 2050.\nWhat utilities and regulators need is a map: one with a clear destination, but also the route the jurisdiction aims to travel in getting there.\nNet zero energy road maps from provincial governments can provide the missing direction. Road maps articulate a provincial government’s vision, objectives, and plans for how the province will meet its energy needs on the road to net zero.\nManitoba and New Brunswick have each committed to developing an energy road map. British Columbia has the beginnings of one. And last summer, Ontario put out its Powering Ontario’s Growth plan, which, despite its gaps , is an important step in the right direction.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Provincial energy road maps are so important that we have argued that they should be a condition of federal funding support for provincial energy transitions. Two years ago, we wrote in support of Ottawa providing provinces with funding for their electricity systems in exchange for provincial governments setting out details of their expansion plans.\nSince then, the federal government has proposed Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credits that could deliver provinces more than $25 billion in support, and suggested some conditions it might attach — including provinces committing to reaching net zero electricity by 2035.\nBut if provincial energy road maps are so important they should be a condition of federal funding, we must not lose sight of the larger point: the transition itself is so important that the details, including the arrival date, shouldn’t stand in the way of accelerating in the right direction.\nAlong these lines, the Electricity Advisory Council recommended in its final report that the federal government swap its proposed conditions for a single and straightforward one: the mere development of energy road maps. The council concluded that a hard 2035 deadline was unnecessary, and that it was more important to focus on the bigger picture. The only stipulations for this new condition would be that road maps focus on getting to net zero domestic energy by 2050, and set out five-year milestones along the way.\nIf the federal government is serious about delivering on its climate goals within Canada’s decentralized federation, it should listen to the council and make credible road maps the sole condition of ITC access.\nThen it’s up to the provinces to hop in the driver’s seat and start driving.\nChristopher Ragan is the founding director of McGill University’s Max Bell School of Public Policy and the former chair of Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission .

    "text": "As instituições bancárias podem ter perdido mais de R$ 50 milhões\ncom o\nesquema de fraude desvendado em uma operação da Polícia Civil e do Ministério Público\n, nesta quinta-feira (13), em Petrópolis, no Rio de Janeiro.\nO cálculo foi revelado pelo delegado João Valentim, titular da Delegacia de Repressão às Ações Criminosas Organizadas (Draco), em conversa com jornalistas.\n\"As investigações evoluíram e comprovaram que outros bancos sofreram o mesmo golpe e sequer têm conhecimento desse fato. Identificamos um banco que sofreu um prejuízo de R$ 20 milhões, e outro que sofreu um prejuízo de R$ 10 milhões a R$ 15 milhões\", explicou o delegado.\nNa operação, a polícia prendeu quatro suspeitos, sendo dois deles gerentes de um banco localizado em Petrópolis, que teve prejuízo de R$ 8 milhões causados pelo grupo criminoso.\n\"Esses gerentes recebiam um valor menor, mas conseguiram adquirir vasto patrimônio, veículos importados, carros de luxo\", exemplificou o delegado.\nAlém disso, foram cumpridos 10 mandados de busca e apreensão na Barra da Tijuca, Zona Oeste da cidade do Rio, e em Petrópolis, nas regiões de Itaipava, Corrêas e Nogueira.\nEm um dos endereços, os agentes encontraram carros e motos de luxo. A suspeita é que os veículos foram adquiridos para lavar o dinheiro obtido através das fraudes.\nGrupo criminoso criou holding para lavagem de dinheiro\nA investigação revelou que os recursos financeiros da organização criminosa foram canalizados para uma holding criada com o propósito de controlar 11 empresas fictícias, as quais foram utilizadas para lavagem de dinheiro.\nOs gerentes atestaram indevidamente fatos falsos como verdadeiros – documentação falsa e atividade empresarial supostamente desenvolvida – e abriram contas para as empresas de fachada. As contas foram utilizadas para respaldar empréstimos milionários e diversas vantagens junto à instituição financeira.\nDe acordo com o GAECO/MPRJ, durante os anos de 2020 e 2022 os denunciados movimentaram aproximadamente R$ 500 milhões. A análise do fluxo financeiro indica que, além do banco prejudicado, outras instituições financeiras também foram alvo do mesmo grupo.\nShell Company significa companhia de fachada. É o termo em inglês para as empresas sem atividade verdadeira, sendo apenas uma ferramenta para esconder a verdadeira atividade (financeira ou ilícita mesmo) desempenhada.\nQuer ficar por dentro das principais notícias do dia?

    "text": "[Alexandra Méndez](https://www.colombia.com/staff/127/alexandra-mendez)• Colombia.com Abundancia y prosperidad: guarda el dinero en este lugar de tu casa para que se multiplique, según el Feng Shui El Feng Shui establece que el dinero debe resguardarse en lugares específicos para atraer la abundancia. El Feng Shui establece que el dinero debe resguardarse en lugares específicos para atraer la abundancia. Tener un hogar próspero y abundante donde el dinero no escasee es el objetivo de la mayoría de personas. Según los creyentes en las energías y el esoterismo, el Feng Shui, una doctrina espiritual oriental, puede ayudarnos a lograrlo. De acuerdo con expertos en Feng Shui, las cosas que tenemos a nuestro alrededor, así como su orden y posición influyen en nuestro bienestar. Esta creencia establece que es necesario tener una “ocupación consciente” de nuestros espacios par armonizar las energías y evitar estancamientos. Teniendo en cuenta esto, el lugar donde guardamos el dinero es muy importante, pues elegir el lugar incorrecto puede alejarnos de la abundancia y promover los problemas financieros. Uno de los lugares menos ideales para tener el dinero es el baño. Si bien no muchas personas eligen esta zona de la casa para guardar sus ahorros, es necesario que tengas en cuenta que este lugar es una fuga de energía, por lo que puede hacer que el dinero se vaya más rápidamente. De acuerdo con la web Feng Shui MB, “por ahí se te puede perder todo el dinero, y también los esfuerzos que inviertes en producirlo”. Para evitar pérdidas de energía en el hogar, se recomienda mantener bajada la tapa del inodoro y reparar cualquier fuga que pueda haber. La cocina es otro lugar que no debes escoger para guardar tu dinero, ya que al estar rodeada de elementos como el fuego y el gas, puede hacer que este se evapore instantáneamente. Pero la pregunta es ¿dónde debo tener el dinero en mi hogar para que se multiplique?, continúa leyendo para saber la respuesta. Según el Feng Shui, el lugar predilecto para ahorrar el dinero y promover la abundancia es, de acuerdo al Mapa Bagua, en una esquina al sudeste de tu casa, puesto que esta área tiene una energía económica muy poderosa y las vibraciones fluirán positivamente allí. La experta en esoterismo y guía espiritual Ángela, de la cuenta de TikTok @angelaconsejeraespiritual, recomienda “guardar el dinero en un lugar limpio ordenado y seguro. Lo más importante es que no debe estar a la vista de los demás”.
