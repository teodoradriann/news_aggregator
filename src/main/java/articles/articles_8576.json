    "title": "Florida lawmakers OK bill requiring fentanyl testing in hospitals. How measure fights overdoses",
    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – A bill to require hospitals to test some patients for the presence of fentanyl in their systems passed the Florida Legislature and is now headed to the governor for his signature.\nHB 1195 passed unanimously in the Florida Senate and House on Wednesday.\nRecommended Videos\nThe bill, also known as “Gage’s Law,” would require hospitals and hospital-based emergency facilities treating patients for a suspected drug overdose or poisoning to test them for fentanyl as well via a urine test.\n[2025 ANNUAL SESSION: See what new bills Florida lawmakers are working on ]\nThe bill is named for Gage Austin Taylor, who died of an overdose in 2022 at the age of 29.\nTaylor’s mother, Gretchen Murray, fought for the bill. She said her son took a drug he didn’t know was laced with fentanyl, and the hospital didn’t test for the drug.\nThat led to an error on the medical examiner’s autopsy report, and as a result, law enforcement was not able to charge Taylor’s suspected drug dealers with homicide initially. After an investigation, the medical examiner changed the report, and law enforcement was able to bring charges.\nMurray brought the bill to the Orange County Legislative Delegation. State Reps. Rita Harris, D-Orlando, and Doug Bankson, R-Apopka, partnered on the bill in the Florida House.\nHarris said the bill is important because of the rise of people taking drugs and not realizing they are laced with fentanyl.\nA legislative staff analysis says that from January 2023 to June 2023, 2,541 people in Florida died because of fentanyl, and of those deaths, 94.3% were accidental.\nThe analysis also cited a report by Epic Research that said only 14% of hospital emergency departments tested for fentanyl, as of June 2023.\n“It’s a bipartisan issue that’s impacting all of Florida, no matter if you’re in a rural area or if you’re in a city,” Harris told News 6 back in February. “You hear these stories and they’re heartbreaking.”\nHarris said it is also important for a hospital to know if a patient has fentanyl in their system so they know what medicinal treatments they can safely give them.\nShould DeSantis sign the bill, it would go into effect on July 1, 2025.\nCopyright 2025 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Starting in the new year, California employers will be barred from asking workers about their use of cannabis outside of work and from discriminating against them because of it. Two bills signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in the past couple of years aim to strengthen the state’s legal cannabis industry by updating outdated laws. [Assembly Bill 2188](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2188), which Newsom signed in 2022, will prohibit employers from using the results of hair or urine tests for marijuana — which can detect traces of cannabis for days or weeks — in their decisions to hire, fire or penalize workers. When the governor signed AB 2188 along with other cannabis-related bills in 2022, he said in a press release that “rigid bureaucracy and federal prohibition continue to pose challenges to the industry and consumers.” [SB 700](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB700), which Newsom signed this year, clarifies AB 2188 by amending the state’s Fair Employment and Housing Act to bar employers from asking job applicants about their prior use of cannabis. California NORML, a nonprofit organization that advocates for consumer rights related to cannabis, sponsored AB 2188. In its argument supporting the bill, the organization said hair or urine testing for marijuana does not detect actual impairment, a fact the federal government has [acknowledged](https://books.google.com/books?id=ybkZs0i3ELoC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=A+positive+test+result,+even+when+confirmed,+only+indicates+that+a+particular+substance+is+present+in+the+test+subject%E2%80%99s+body+tissue.+It+does+not+indicate+abuse+or+addiction;+recency,+frequency,+or+amount+of+use;+or+impairment&source=bl&ots=GiVhuWOQgj&sig=ACfU3U26hndTWloIJYYX_OhrBdiKZ_kfCg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK3v-Vk_nwAhXdFVkFHZSoDL0Q6AEwAHoECAIQAw#v=onepage&q=A%20positive%20test%20result%2C%20even%20when%20confirmed%2C%20only%20indicates%20that%20a%20particular%20substance%20is%20present%20in%20the%20test%20subject%E2%80%99s%20body%20tissue.%20It%20does%20not%20indicate%20abuse%20or%20addiction%3B%20recency%2C%20frequency%2C%20or%20amount%20of%20use%3B%20or%20impairment&f=false). “Studies indicate that metabolite tests for past use of marijuana are useless in protecting job safety,” the group said.",

    "text": "New Book Looks At The Impactful Ways That Climate And Weather Changed The Very Course Of Humanity And Civilization\nNEW YORK , Jan. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AccuWeather Founder and Executive Chairman, Dr. Joel N. Myers , will release his debut book , Invisible Iceberg: When Climate and Weather Shaped History , on January 16, 2024 , at The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland . Featuring fascinating examples of the important role that weather events and climate have played in shaping humanity and civilization, the book is an enjoyable read for anyone interested in science, history, and geopolitics.\nContinue Reading\nJoin AccuWeather Founder and Executive Chairman Dr. Joel N. Myers on a journey from the beginning of time to the modern day to see how weather and climate impacted world events throughout history.\nInvisible Iceberg encourages readers to consider, reflect, and speculate on key historical events by combining scientific insights with engaging human stories. Weather has had a tremendous impact on global events from the beginning of time, shaping both the destiny of humanity and individual people in ways that nothing else can match. Volcanic eruptions, comets, ice ages, and other major climate change events have shaped and reshaped our natural world. Throughout this book, readers will learn about the hurricanes, snowstorms, droughts, and even the sunny days that changed the course of history and the path of civilization.\nExtreme weather and climate events have intensified public health emergencies, shaped political landscapes, affected economies and election results, and inspired art and literature throughout history. Understanding the importance of weather and climate is vital as we confront the most pressing challenges our modern society faces today. Invisible Iceberg not only educates, but also underscores the profound impact of weather and climate on business, civilization, and warfare. As the world faces ongoing volatility, the strategic importance of weather and climate intelligence in business and geopolitical decision-making becomes increasingly clear. The book illustrates how such factors are just as vital for today's leaders and decision-makers, drawing from key historical moments that highlight the critical role of weather and climate in shaping logistics, encouraging human migration, and planning critical battles. In the current climate of economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest, it is essential for today's leaders to integrate meteorological data and forecasts into their strategic planning to maintain effective global trade, protect people, and mitigate climate change.\nExtreme weather was identified as the biggest risk in 2024 by the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report , and as the frequency and severity of extreme weather and climate events increase, so do their direct economic costs .\n\"Weather affects all of us – everything from what we do, where we live, what we buy, and even our moods,\" said Dr. Myers. \"With climate change continuing, undoubtedly with a significant portion of it due to human activity, severe weather is shaping our history more and more each day. The art and science of weather prediction has improved dramatically over the last 100 years, some of it led by AccuWeather, allowing us to more accurately anticipate the impacts of weather and climate. But what we do with that knowledge is up to us. One of the key themes at Davos this year is discussing a long-term strategy for climate, nature and energy, and I hope that when a sequel to this book is written in decades hence, it will include many more chapters showing that, through innovation, science, technology, creativity, and common purpose, humans will prevent the disasters that might occur if global warming exceeds a tipping point.\"\nInvisible Iceberg: When Climate and Weather Shaped History By Joel N. Myers Skyhorse Publishing, hardcover also available in E-Book On Sale: January 16, 2024 $26.99 ISBN: 9781510776630 https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781510776630/invisible-iceberg/\nBook Description: Discover the impactful ways that climate and weather changed the very course of human history from the Founder and Executive Chairman of AccuWeather! Dr. Joel N. Myers takes readers on a journey from the beginning of time to the modern day to see how weather and climate impacted world events throughout history, both the good and the bad.\nLearn about the comet that hit Earth almost 67 million years ago, and how it triggered a massive climate disruption that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs; the dramatic climate shift in 1213 BC that created the conditions for the Ten Plagues of Egypt , a foundational moment in three major world religions; how superior knowledge of the winds allowed the ancient Greeks to prevail over Persian attackers in 400 BC; the volcano in 44 BC that helped launch the Roman Empire; how tropical storms thwarted Mongol invaders and preserved an independent Japan in 1273; how the \"Little Ice Age\" ushered in the age of the European Witch Trials, which eventually influenced the Salem Witch Trials; the shipwreck of the Sea Venture in 1609 in an Atlantic hurricane that inspired Shakespeare's last play, The Tempest; the fog that helped to create an independent United States of America during the Revolutionary War; the storm in 1814 that ended the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte ; the \"Great White Hurricane,\" i.e. two major blizzards, that helped create the New York subway system in 1888; how the ice-filled waters in which the Titanic sailed, which were colder than the air above, created a phenomenon known as thermal inversion that made it so the crew aboard that fated vessel could not see objects until they got too close; and so much more!\nAlso explored are weather what-ifs, including the haunting question: Would the hurricane that remained off the coast have prevented the deadly attacks of September 11, 2001 , if it had just moved inland?\nInvisible Iceberg: When Climate and Weather Shaped History is an exciting, sometimes shocking, trip around the world and through time to prove once and for all that weather really does affect the world and the course of history!\nAbout The Author Dr. Myers, Founder and Executive Chairman of AccuWeather , is considered the \"father of modern commercial meteorology\" and the nation's most respected authority on the business of weather.
