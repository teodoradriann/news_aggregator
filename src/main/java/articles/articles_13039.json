    "text": "STORY: This is the moment Bolivian president Luis Arce confronted Army general Juan Jose Zuniga, who led a failed effort to overthrow the government...\n...after attempting to storm the presidential palace and ramming the entrance with an armored vehicle.\nHours later, Zuniga was seen handcuffed on live TV after his arrest for the failed coup attempt, which has raised fears that democracy in Bolivia remains at risk.\nOn Thursday, it was revealed by a senior interior minister that the Bolivian government had intelligence that a coup attempt could occur...\n...and that Arce had received reports about \"destabilization attempts.\"\nArce has since slammed the coup attempt and swiftly named a new top general.\nAccording to a government official, Zuniga had been told a day before the coup attempt that he would be stripped of his position.\nThe former commander is now among 17 people who have been detained, so far, and could face prison terms of between 15 and 30 years.\nWednesday's events uncovered the tense political fault lines in the South American country ahead of a presidential election next year.\nArce's socialist party is split between backing him and his former mentor-turned-political-rival, ex-President Evo Morales.\nZuniga had recently said that Morales should not be able to run again for president and had threatened to block him if he attempted to do so.\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "ROME: Pope Francis has said in an interview that Ukraine should have what he called the courage of the “white flag” and negotiate an end to the war with Russia that followed Moscow’s full-scale invasion two years ago and that has killed tens of thousands.\nFrancis made his comments in an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, well before Friday’s latest offer by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war.\nErdogan made the fresh offer after a meeting in Istanbul with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has said while he wants peace he will not give up any territory.\nThe Ukrainian leader’s own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv.\nA spokesman for Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope’s remarks.\nIn the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimise actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term “white flag” in the question.\n“It is one interpretation, that is true,” Francis said, according to an advance transcript of the interview and a partial video made available to Reuters on Saturday. It is due to be broadcast on March 20 as part of a new cultural program.\n“But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers.\n“The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,” Francis said.\nIt was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms such as “white flag” or “defeated” in discussing the Ukraine war. – REUTERS",

    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard Posts 'First Selfie of Freedom' Following 8 Years in Prison The selfie came a day after Blanchard was released from the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe, Missouri.\nBy Mark Elibert\n(Image via YouTube)\n(Image via YouTube) Gypsy Rose Blanchard has updated her Instagram page after she was released from her eight-year prison sentence .\nThe 32-year-old shared her very first selfie on the social media app on Friday, where she posed for the flick in a hotel room to celebrate her newfound freedom.\n\"First selfie of freedom!,\" Blanchard wrote in the caption.\nView this photo on Instagram Instagram: @gypsyrose_a_blanchard Blanchard's post arrived a day after she was released from the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe, Missouri. She served eight years inside for her role in planning to murder her mother, Claudine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard, who exposed her to excessive medical treatment and made her believe she had several illnesses as a child.\nThe 32-year-old came up with the murder plot alongside her then-boyfriend Nicholas \"Nick\" Godejohn. The man went through with the crime while Blanchard stayed in the bathroom as her mother was murdered.\nDuring Blanchard's trial, it was argued that she was a victim of Munchausen syndrome —a mental disorder where a patient fakes illness to gain attention and sympathy—through her mother. In an interview with PEOPLE days before her release from prison, Blanchard explained if she had the opportunity to change the past, she would.\n\"If I had another chance to redo everything, I don't know if I would go back to when I was a child and tell my aunts and uncles that I'm not sick and mommy makes me sick, or, if I would travel back to just the point of that conversation with Nick and tell him, 'You know what, I'm going to go tell the police everything.' I kind of struggle with that,\" she said before saying she regrets her mother's death. \"Nobody will ever hear me say I'm glad she's dead or I'm proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.\"\nMore on this Barack Obama Shares His Favorite Music of 2023 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion, Tyla, Brent Faiyaz, and More tara mahadevan · Dec. 29, 2023 Keith Lee Ranks His Favorite Food Cities, New Orleans Grabs No. 1 Spot tara mahadevan · Dec. 29, 2023 Florida Woman Files Lawsuit Against Hershey Company for $5 Billion, Alleges False Advertising tara mahadevan · Dec. 29, 2023",

    "text": "President Biden and the team doing the work for him. ( [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/P20210720AS-3425-2_%2851417135942%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/440px-P20210720AS-3425-2_%2851417135942%29_%28cropped%29.jpg) by [Wikipedia (commons.wikimedia.org)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:P20210720AS-3425-2_%2851417135942%29_%28cropped%29.jpg), Author: [The White House](https://www.flickr.com/people/191819781@N02)) [Details](/populum/attrdetails.php?vid=180300) [Source](/populum/attrdetails.php?vid=180300) [DMCA](/populum/dmca.php?vid=180300) Sometimes the nay-sayers unintentionally help the aye-sayers. For example, with all the media hype on whether Joe Biden should seek re-election and questions about whether he is too old and is still capable of handling the responsibilities of the presidency, one of the strongest arguments in his favor has been his record of accomplishments in office. It is considerable. He brought inflation down and employment way up. He lowered prescription drug prices and capped the cost of insulin for seniors. He got wealthy corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and got legislation through Congress to combat gun violence. He actually made a major investment in rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, something that his opponent talked about a lot but never did anything about. He revived the American chip industry. He added a new nation to NATO and solidified America's alliances in the Pacific Rim. Oh yeah, the leading stock market indicators are at record highs. To which some nay-sayers reply: How do you know? There could be a cabinet of people running things on his behalf. Well, I sure hope so. The sign of a good leader, a good executive, a good president is having people around him capable of making his or her vision a reality. No president can do it alone. Whom he chooses to be part of his team and what the team accomplishes says a lot about the president. So by trying to take credit away from Biden by saying maybe a whole bunch of other people accomplished these things in his name, the critics are actually complimenting Biden for his vision, for choosing good people and for listening to what they have to say and helping them get it done. By comparison, many team members from Donald Trump's chaotic presidency have criticized him for his lack of understanding or caring about presidential responsibilities. Others are in prison. Possible members of a Trump team in 2025 have authored the notorious Project 2025, which explains in detail how they would dissemble American democracy in favor of an authoritarian Christian nation. Predictably, since details of that document have been made public and been widely criticized, Trump, whose name appears throughout the document, has disavowed it. That's because Trump, a convicted felon, has no agenda other than himself and power. If it's going to hurt his ratings, he tries to run away from it. He bragged about getting Roe v. Wade overturned by appointing Supreme Court justices who would do it. But when that decision met strong opposition, he tried to backtrack from that, too. He simply lies about everything and fires people who don't help feed his ego. Suffice to say, any team of folks behind the scenes doing things in Trump's name are going to do their best to make him happy. And he's already told us many times that what makes him happy is being treated special (absolute immunity!) and getting even with those who don't comply. The team wagging the dog for Trump will be ruthless and vicious because he will pick those who will do his bidding in order to further their own agenda. Not the nicest and not necessarily the best and brightest. He learned that from his first term in office. He knows more than all the generals. Sycophants and soldiers, that's what he wants. So, nay-sayers, do I want all those mysterious, intelligent, caring people behind the scenes making all those decisions for old, arthritic Joe Biden or do I want all those \"authoritarian, anti-democratic, rightwing Christian, post the 10 Commandments in every classroom, women's place is in the kitchen and pregnant, cut Social Security, arrest the homeless and leave billionaires alone, don't force us to be violent\" people making decisions for Donald Trump while he goes around the world like a reality show Don Quixote, jousting at windmills? Thanks, I'll stick with Joe's team. Bob Gaydos rjgaydos@gmail.com",
