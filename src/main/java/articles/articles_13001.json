    "text": "¡Alerta! Hay riesgo de apagones de luz en México, por tercer día consecutivo Por tercer día consecutivo hay riesgo de sufrir [apagones de luz](https://www.record.com.mx/contra/por-que-hay-apagones-de-luz-en-mexico-aqui-te-lo-explicamos) en diferentes estados de [México](https://www.record.com.mx/contra/pese-a-calor-proteccion-civil-pide-apagar-ventiladores-y-aire-acondicionado-para-evitar-mas), luego de que el Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (Cenace) informó este 9 de mayo que se activó la alerta en el Estado Operativo del Sistema Eléctrico Nacional. Al igual que sucedió el martes 7 de mayo y el miércoles 8, el Cenace publicó un comunicado en el que informa: “A partir de las 15:02 del 9 de mayo de 2024 se declara estado operativo de Alerta en el Sistema Interconectado Nacional”. Esto obedece a que el Margen de Reserva Operativa (la energía de respaldo disponible) está en riego de bajar del 6%, que es el mínimo requerido para funcionar, producto de que varias plantas generadoras de energía alrededor del país tuvieron que ser desconectadas por las altas temperaturas que se han presentado. A ello hay que sumarle que las personas consumen más energía eléctrica en estos días que se vive la segunda ola de calor de la temporada, principalmente para tener encendidos por varias horas aparatos como ventiladores o sistemas de aire acondicionado, que ayudan a refrescar los hogares, centros de trabajo y estancias de todo tipo. Recordar que fue el pasado martes por la noche que al menos 13 estados de la República Mexicana sufrieron de apagones de luz, los cuales duraron entre 15 minutos a una hora, según reportes de usuarios en redes sociales. Lugares de México que sufrieron apagones de luz el pasado 7 de mayo de 2024: Guanajuato (León, Irapuato, Celaya, Salamanca, Apaseo el Grande, Cortázar, Juventino Rosas) Puebla (Zona metropolitana) Chiapas (Tuxtla Gutiérrez) Zacatecas (Zona metropolitana) Tabasco (Nacajuca, Comalcalco, Cárdenas, Jonuta, Jalpa de Méndez, Centla) Tamaulipas (Reynosa, Matamoros, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso) Querétaro (San Juan del Río) Nayarit (Ixtlán del Río, Tecuala, Acaponeta, Tuxpan, Santiago Ixcuintla) Nuevo León (Zona metropolitana de Monterrey, Apodaca) Veracruz (Poza Rica, Coatzintla, Tihuatlán, Tuxpan) Campeche (Hopelchén, Chiná) Estado de México (Toluca, San Mateo Atenco, Lerma, Zinacantepec) Ciudad de México (Gustavo A. Madero, Tlalpan, Iztapalapa, Azcapotzalco).

    "title": "THE LONG GAME Cast Say Movie is 'Good for Our Youth'",
    "text": "THE LONG GAME Cast Say Movie is ‘Good for Our Youth’ By Movieguide® Contributor THE LONG GAME tells the true story of a Hispanic high school golf team overcoming the odds, the cast explains why audiences should go see the movie today. “I feel like whenever there’s a movie about inspiration and motivation, it’s good for our youth, you know,” Julian Works [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn1-SEcdxdE) Movieguide®. “I remember when I was younger, both my parents worked nine to fives, so movies were kind of the filling space to kind of help shape my character. So, if I could, you know, be someone for a younger generation to go ahead and look at and they gain some kind of motivation or inspiration from it, I feel like I’ve done my job.” “We love the story, a true story of these young men that just overcame all the obstacles,” [added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn1-SEcdxdE) Executive Producer Jesse Mandujano. “They worked very hard, and they didn’t allow even, you know, the racism back then to defeat them. It’s like, watch what we can do.” “They didn’t retaliate. They just said, ‘Just watch what we can do.’ They continued to work harder than everyone else, and they became champions, and that’s what it’s about,” Madujano continued. “There may be circumstances that are against you, but this is what I’m going to do in a positive manner to overcome all of those and succeed.” The cast hopes that the story of perseverance and hard work shines through this movie. They believe American audiences are always hungry for an underdog story, and that is something that this movie delivers. “This is a great underdog story,” [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn1-SEcdxdE) Miguel Ángel Garcia. “I love underdog stories, you know, you’re always trying to fight for those people, and I think the story is really important because it shows that side of perseverance, you know. These guys didn’t have any resources to compete and play golf, and they were able to achieve something beautiful [and] wonderous, and that to me is really special.” The movie capitalizes on all the storylines it has going for it to create an entertaining story that also teaches strong moral lessons. A portion of Movieguide®’s review [reads](https://www.movieguide.org/reviews/movies/in-theaters/the-long-game.html): THE LONG GAME has a strong morally uplifting story and worldview that’s entertaining and fun to watch. The movie has jeopardy, drama and laughs. Also, the actors in THE LONG GAME do a great job. MOVIEGUIDE® advises caution for older children for some foul language, including two strong profanities, and intense moments. The cast also hopes the uplifting storyline will bring audiences relief from the darker content that is constantly flooding Hollywood. By focusing on an uplifting story, they hope to bring joy and life to the audience. “[We made this] just as a counterpoint to all of the darker content that’s out there,” [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn1-SEcdxdE) Jesse Metcalfe. “I mean, you can’t have the dark without the light, you know.” Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/dennis-quaid-the-long-game-explores-the-american-dream.html): Dennis Quaid recently opened up with Movieguide® about how his latest movie, THE LONG GAME, inspires audiences and exemplifies the American Dream. “People come here; they work hard,” [said]Quaid, who produced and starred in the movie. “That American Dream that, you know, can be elusive that you pave the way for you or your next generation, but you’re always working towards something, and there’s all kinds of possibilities.” To Quaid, part of what makes the story so remarkable is the caddies’ determination. “These boys, you know, they grew up in Del Rio, Texas. They were caddies at a country club where they could not play in because of their color. It was segregation at that time, and you know, add on to that, you know, the Mexican American boys down on the border, and they go across the border sometimes, and so in a way, you kind of grow up feeling like you’re not accepted or belong in this country, and also…go across the border to Mexico, [you] don’t feel really accepted or [like] you belong there as well,” Quaid explained. Now more than ever we’re bombarded by darkness in media, movies, and TV. Movieguide® has fought back for almost 40 years, working within Hollywood to propel uplifting and positive content. We’re proud to say we’ve collaborated with some of the top industry players to influence and redeem entertainment for Jesus. Still, the most influential person in Hollywood is you. The viewer.
