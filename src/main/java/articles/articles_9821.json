    "text": "Verizon users in Keene and surrounding areas are experiencing widespread service outages. The issue started after a network failure which began early Wednesday morning. According to DownDetector, the outage started around 9.10 AM and has affected mobile data, voice calls, text messaging and wireless home internet services offered by Verizon. Due to the outage the Verizon users in the southwestern New Hampshire region are left without reliable cellular and data services. The DownDetector data reveals that due to the ongoing outage 54% users are facing issues with mobile phone, 24% are experiencing no signal and 22% are unable to access 5G home internet. While Keene is among the hardest hit, other cities such as New York, Atlanta, and Pittsburgh have also seen elevated outage reports Verizon outage: What the company said\nThe Verizon support page shows that the telecom operator is working on a fix. The company has also activated its standard outage notification system to keep affected customers informed of repair progress. Verizon engineers have been working since mid-morning Wednesday to diagnose and resolve the issue. Initial repair estimates were pushed back after crews discovered additional complications. Verizon has advised users to enable Wi-Fi calling on their smartphones to maintain communication while the cellular network remains down. This feature allows calls and texts to be routed through Wi-Fi networks instead of relying on mobile signals. Verizon has not released detailed information about the root cause of the outage, following the company's typical practice of focusing on repair efforts rather than providing extensive technical explanations.

    "text": "Denali as seen from the Reflection Pond. | Picture: National Park Services A skier was confirmed dead after being caught in a soft slab avalanche from below the Rescue Gully above Camp 14 on Denali, Alaska. The slide occurred on the West Buttress Route at approximately 6:15 p.m. on June 10. Nicholas Vizzini, age 29 of Washington State, and his climbing partner, a snowboarder, triggered the avalanche while descending the slope.\nAccording to the report by National Park Services , two mountaineering rangers on an acclimatization climb spotted the partner on the surface of the avalanche debris and were able to respond within minutes. After a quick assessment of the partner, a beacon search was initiated and a signal acquired. During the search, Vizzini was visually located and found to be mostly buried in the debris. The rangers immediately began digging to establish an airway. CPR was initiated but discontinued after forty minutes due to traumatic injuries and no pulse.\nThe soft slab avalanche on Denali, Alaska. | Picture:National Park Services After recovery, rangers flew the body to Talkeetna, where they transferred it to the state medical examiner. Vizzini’s partner sustained minor injuries and is scheduled to fly off the mountain today.\nRescue Gully starts at 17,200 feet on the West Buttress route. The top of where the avalanche released was approximately 16,600 feet and the avalanche ran down to approximately 15,000 feet.\nThis is the second death on Denali this climbing season. On June 4, Alex Chiu, aged 41 of Seattle, Washington, died as a result of a 3,000-foot fall from the Denali West Buttress climbing route on to the Peters Glacier.\nThis marks the 23rd avalanche related death of the 2024-25 hydrological season, which runs from October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2025. There have been approximately 13 avalanche-related deaths and more than 130 total deaths on the mountain recorded in the history of the park. There are currently 500 climbers on the mountain.\nThe climbing season on Denali is rather short and typically begins in early May and ends in early July.",

    "text": "(NEW YORK) -- Sweden's arduous path to joining the NATO alliance came to a successful close Thursday, as the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister deposited the country's \"instrument of accession\" at the State Department in Washington.\nIn a lighthearted ceremony, Secretary of State Antony Blinken posed for photos with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, with the two holding a blue folder containing the document. Blinken quipped, \"Well, good things come to those who wait.\"\n\"With receipt of this instrument of accession, let me be the very first to welcome Sweden as a party to the Washington Treaty and the 32nd member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,\" Blinken continued.\nBlinken remarked on Sweden's longstanding military neutrality, and how the country was moved to end its tradition after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022. Sweden was called to defend democracy and recognized the existential threat Russia's aggression presented to European nations, he said.\n\"None of this was easy, none of this was obvious,\" Blinken said, adding it had taken \"nearly two years of tireless diplomacy\" to add Sweden to the alliance.\n\"Sweden is now a NATO member,\" Kristersson said on X earlier. \"Thank you all Allies for welcoming us as the 32nd member. We will strive for unity, solidarity and burden-sharing, and will fully adhere to the Washington Treaty values: freedom, democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. Stronger together.\"\nSweden's membership had been slowed by objections from Turkey and Hungary. The U.S. was able to eventually incentivize Turkey by approving the sale of fighter jets to the country, and Hungary signed off on Sweden's addition this week.\n\"This is a historic day,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. \"Sweden will now take its rightful place at NATO's table, with an equal say in shaping NATO policies and decisions. After over 200 years of non-alignment Sweden now enjoys the protection granted under Article 5, the ultimate guarantee of Allies' freedom and security. Sweden brings with it capable armed forces and a first-class defense industry.\"\nSweden's flag will be raised alongside those of the other 31 Allies in a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels on March 11 and simultaneously at NATO commands across Europe and North America, NATO said.",

    "text": "Opinion\nPlaying a dangerous game\nBen Wildsmith\nIf you visit the House of Commons to sit in the public gallery, they hand you a leaflet that emphasises the majesty of the procedure you are witnessing. The ‘mother of parliaments’, it tells you, is the cradle of modern democracy and the gold standard for government of and by the people.\nThe tone of the leaflet suggests that it’s aimed at foreign tourists, which is just as well, because anybody living in the UK would be well within their rights in reporting our parliamentary mother to social services.\nFirstly, to get it out of the way, having a king is plainly at odds with democratic values. Abolishing the monarchy, though, requires more than tweeting #notmyking 23 times a day and buying a Guy Fawkes mask.\nYou’re paying for him, so until you organise a revolution, he #isyourking.\nIndependence\nSimilarly, independence might bring a better democratic model for us here in Wales, but we face immediate problems around fundamentals like housing and healthcare that cannot wait for that outcome.\nEven in these reduced circumstances, however, we are supposed to have some mechanism for influencing the decisions made on our behalf.\nMost of us, of course, never influence Westminster politics with our votes. The first-past-the-post system means that casting a ballot in safe constituencies is largely symbolic. Again though, changing that would be the work of decades.\nWhat I’m addressing here is the system as it is sold to us: the monarchical, Anglocentric, gerrymandered farce of democracy that we are too apathetic to overthrow. How’s that going; on its own terms?\nWell, by my reckoning, we haven’t received even the appearance of a democratic outcome to an election since 2005. Tony Blair’s victory that year came with the caveat that he’d finally be handing over the reins to Gordon Brown, because leadership of the nation is the sort of thing decided in an Islington restaurant, rather than a General Election.\nAt least we knew about that, though. In 2010, after the financial crisis had turned Brown into\nAdmiral Doenitz, we greeted the Conservative/Lib-Dem coalition.\nElectoral reform\nThe creation of this government involved the hasty drafting of a programme of government for which nobody at all had voted. Laughably, it included provision for a referendum on electoral reform which David Cameron’s party was not required to support.\n2015’s election brought a Conservative majority at the cost of the Brexit referendum which swiftly saw off Cameron. Then we had Theresa May with no mandate, Theresa May with the DUP, Boris Johnson with no mandate, Boris Johnson in coalition with Covid-19, Liz Truss with no mandate, and Rishi Sunak with no mandate.\nIn the midst of all this, some people clung desperately to the Brexit vote as evidence of democracy enduring. Even for them, though, it must be a stretch.\nTo keep that show on the road, the UK government has effectively reunified Ireland and created so many vocational exceptions to the restriction on freedom of movement that you could be forgiven for suspecting they’re not quite as averse to immigration as they make out.\nCaution\nAll of this means that Keir Starmer’s anxiety to demonstrate caution in the run-up to next year’s election may prove to be reckless in the medium term.\nSo far, we have had three Keirs. There was the enthusiastic Europhile of Jeremy Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet, the sensible radical who ran for the leadership, and now the Brexit convert who eschews left-wing economics, cleaves to Government foreign policy and is scaling back commitments on the environment and constitutional reform.\nLabour enthusiasts tend to nod and wink that he’ll pivot left again once he’s safely elected. How do they think that will go?\nPeople have been voting for governments that bear no relation to what they offered for nearly 20 years. Brexit not only failed to deliver economic results, but hasn’t satisfied those voters who wanted, for whatever reason, to stem immigration and assert UK sovereignty. Democracy is seemingly divorced from the mechanism of Government altogether.\nThe starkest UK example of this was the defenestration by the bond markets of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng. Although only tangentially connected to an election result, they did, at least, hold offices of state in a country that claims to be democratic.\nThose responsible for their removal, necessary as it was, were faceless speculators.\nAbroad, meanwhile, Russia and China have ceased to pay lip service to democracy at all, whilst the ruling families of the Gulf prosper with little internal dissent.\nInsurrection\nFinally, we face the prospect of Donald Trump returning to power in the USA having openly incited insurrection and baldly promising to override any democratic institutions that hinder his will.\nNext year’s general election will, paradoxically, be our most acrimonious, whilst offering the narrowest ideological choice we have ever seen.\nFury will erupt around gender and immigration issues, but the major parties offer no meaningful change to the economic status quo. Democracy has become low-rent entertainment.\nVoters get to vent their frustration on carefully ring-fenced fringe issues while the juggernaut of international finance motors on regardless, stripping our public services and administering our lives by stealth.\nIt may be that democracy has exhausted itself. Perhaps we are too mistrustful and cynical to demand vibrancy from it anymore. But as the Welsh Labour Party prepares to offer its members a choice between two versions of Drakeford Lite, and Keir Starmer surveys the car crash of 2023 Britain only to prescribe an aspirin, they’d be unwise to rely on our apathy lasting forever.\nThe Trumpish overtures of Reform UK have their own TV channel in GB News and the Tory press at their service once Sunak is defeated. They will be reminding everyone that along with Powellite rhetoric on race, they promise to raise the threshold for income tax to £20 000 per year.\nIn its wariness, the left across the UK is playing a dangerous game.\n ",

Esta línea de ayudas está dirigida a entidades del Tercer Sector que promuevan itinerarios personalizados de acceso al mercado laboral cuyos resultados obtenidos hasta el momento alcanzan más del 30 por ciento de las inserciones laborales y la mejora de la cualificación de más del 25 por ciento de los participantes. La convocatoria, publicada hoy en el Boletín Oficial de la Región de Murcia, beneficiará a más 4.000 personas, se desarrolla en el marco del Programa FSE+ 2021-2027 y está financiada en un 60 por ciento por el Fondo Social Europeo y el 40 por ciento restante con fondos propios de la Comunidad. Los proyectos podrán desarrollarse entre el 1 de abril de 2024 y el 31 de diciembre de 2025, con una duración máxima de 21 meses, y podrán hacerlo bajo cuatro tipologías diferentes: los programas comarcales, con un máximo de financiación de 268.000 euros; los dirigidos a dos territorios, con una subvención de hasta 229.000 euros; así como los programas de un solo ámbito de actuación e institucionales, dotados con 195.000 y 150.000 euros, respectivamente. El IMAS, dentro de su plan de atención preferente a las personas en situación de vulnerabilidad social que precisan apoyos para lograr un empleo en condiciones de equidad, incluye en esta convocatoria actuaciones de mejora competencial de la persona, asesoramiento y un acompañamiento integral técnico para facilitar su incorporación laboral. Una iniciativa que permitirá mantener los 71 dispositivos de acción social para la mejora de la empleabilidad que se están desarrollando actualmente en todo el territorio regional. Estos itinerarios individualizados de inclusión activa se realizarán de forma coordinada con los Servicios Sociales, de Empleo y los agentes implicados en los procesos de formación y empleo del territorio o ámbito de actuación.

Repression forced the church underground in Soviet times and it now has about 4.5 million parishioners, or roughly 10% of the population of Ukraine.\nThe document from the Vatican’s doctrinal office said Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies.\nIt said such blessings would be a sign that God welcomes all but should not be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage.\nGay rights are making some progress in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states outside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed sympathy for upholding gay rights, though ruling out constitutional changes to allow single-sex marriages while the country is at war.\n(This story has been corrected to say ‘same-sex couples,’ not ‘same-sex marriage,’ in the headline)\n(Reporting by Ron Popeski; Editing by Chris Reese)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

    "text": "La conversación - Infancias conectadas Durante un taller en una escuela secundaria, la pregunta sorprende: “¿A quién le gustaría usar menos el celular?”. La mayoría levanta la mano. El malestar digital ya no es solo cosa de adultos. A lo largo de casi 30 minutos de conversación en Infobae , tres voces expertas –la psiquiatra Geraldine Peronace, la especialista en educación de UNICEF Cora Steinberg y la consultora en ciudadanía digital Lucía Fainboim – coinciden en algo elemental, pero urgente: el uso problemático de las pantallas no es un fenómeno aislado, y sus consecuencias sobre la salud mental y la sociabilidad infantil ya son tangibles.\nEste artículo forma parte de La Conversación , el nuevo ciclo audiovisual de Infobae disponible en YouTube, que propone abrir el debate sobre temáticas complejas que atraviesan a la Argentina. Se trata de un espacio de conversación reflexiva moderado por Gonzalo Sánchez , donde, en cada episodio, expertos, investigadores, activistas o referentes comparten su mirada sobre un tema de interés social, político o económico. Los episodios estarán disponibles todos los jueves en el canal de YouTube de Infobae . En esta edición, el foco está puesto en el vínculo entre infancias, adolescencias y el mundo digital.\nSegún una reciente encuesta nacional de UNICEF Argentina, el 46% de los niños y adolescentes reconoce tener un vínculo problemático con el uso de tecnología . “Lo dicen ellos. Es una encuesta autoadministrada. Responden solos que sienten que les impacta en la escuela y en el descanso”, señala Steinberg. No son diagnósticos adultocéntricos: es un grito de auxilio de los propios protagonistas.\nEl periodista Gonzalo Sánchez junto a la psiquiatra Geraldine Peronace, la especialista en educación de UNICEF Cora Steinberg y la consultora en ciudadanía digital Lucía Fainboim Un celular a los 9 años, una puerta abierta sin adultos El promedio de edad para el primer celular con Internet en Argentina es 9,6 años. “Más del 83% de los chicos ya accede a su primer dispositivo entre los 9 y los 11 años”, advierte Steinberg. Y con él, se abre un mundo de vínculos, estímulos y riesgos que, muchas veces, transitan sin acompañamiento. “Hoy Internet es un espacio más que ellos habitan, como el club o la escuela. Pero a diferencia de esos lugares, no hay adultos mirándolos”, explica Fainboim.\nEl auge de la inteligencia artificial y las redes sociales intensifica el debate sobre el aprendizaje y la salud mental de los jóvenes (Imagen ilustrativa Infobae) El problema no son solo las horas frente a la pantalla (que, en promedio, ascienden a 8 horas y 40 minutos por día), sino lo que se consume en ese tiempo. “Tenemos chicos de seis años mirando pornografía, otros participando en desafíos virales que los han llevado a la muerte, y otros contactados por adultos que se hacen pasar por menores. Eso es contenido, conducta y contacto: los tres grandes riesgos”, resume Peronace.\nNo son nativos digitales, son aprendices sin guía Uno de los conceptos más discutidos por los especialistas es el de “nativos digitales” . Fainboim, que lidera la organización Bienestar Digital, lo desarma con claridad: “Decimos que por haber nacido en esta época ya tienen habilidades, pero lo que vemos es que no tienen ni habilidades operativas ni reflexivas. Para eso nos necesitan”. El acceso temprano no equivale a comprensión ni a criterio.\nA falta de mediación adulta, la lógica de las plataformas se impone. “Si un chico ve un video sobre cómo adelgazar, toda la semana le van a ofrecer ese tipo de contenido. Y en segundo lugar, buscan cómo ganar dinero. Esos son los principales consumos según la encuesta”, alerta Steinberg. En ese combo, la autoestima, la imagen corporal y la percepción del éxito quedan atrapadas en algoritmos sin empatía.\nLa dopamina como trampa Lo que parece inofensivo –un rato de TikTok, un poco de YouTube– puede tener consecuencias biológicas profundas. “Cuando un chico no se aburre, no puede activar esa parte del cerebro que se relaciona con la creatividad” , explica Peronace. En su lugar, el cerebro entra en “rumiación”: pensamientos obsesivos, repetitivos y negativos, que incrementan el riesgo de depresión, autolesiones y suicidio.\n“En la clínica estamos viendo cuadros que antes asociábamos a consumo crónico de marihuana, y que hoy se explican por más de 11 horas diarias de pantalla. Ansiedad, desconexión afectiva, pérdida de memoria, aplanamiento emocional”, describe la psiquiatra.\nLos chicos empiezan a darse cuenta Un dato esperanzador emerge entre tanta preocupación: “Cuando hacemos talleres en secundaria y preguntamos quién quiere usar menos el celular, ahora levantan la mano todos”, cuenta Fainboim. Incluso los adolescentes que accedieron al celular a los 9 años o antes tienen una mirada crítica: “Dicen que vieron contenido perturbador, que se perdieron experiencias importantes. Se dan cuenta” , agrega.\nLa 'podredumbre cerebral' preocupa a médicos y padres por el impacto del consumo excesivo de contenido digital (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) La urgencia, entonces, no es prohibir sino acompañar. “Cuando hay mayor presencia adulta, cuando hay mediación, baja significativamente el riesgo de que se conecten con desconocidos, hagan apuestas online o sufran grooming”, afirma Steinberg.\n¿Y qué hacemos los adultos? Muchos padres, reconocen los expertos, usamos el celular como estrategia de supervivencia. “Nos resulta cómodo el niño conectado porque nos da un rato de descanso. Pero ya no alcanza con pensar que si está en casa está seguro”, plantea Fainboim. La idea de que “si no está en la calle, está bien” quedó obsoleta: el peligro está también en el living.\nPeronace es contundente: “El ‘no’ se aprende en casa. Y si no lo enseñamos nosotros, después no vamos a poder hacerlo cuando tenga 13 años y quiera tomar whisky o fumar porro . Empieza con el celular”.\nEducación emocional y presencia real Más allá del tiempo frente a las pantallas, el desafío está en las habilidades que los chicos deben desarrollar por fuera de ellas. “Empatía, oralidad, comprensión lectora, capacidad de aburrirse, de frustrarse. Todo eso se aprende en la interacción cara a cara”, dice Fainboim.\nEl excesivo uso de pantallas afectaría a los jóvenes en el desarrollo de sus capacidades emocionales (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Y para eso se necesita tiempo compartido, en la presencia y en la palabra. No se trata de desaparecer cuando se prende la pantalla. “Veamos una peli juntos, pongamos reglas: que el contenido tenga inicio, desarrollo y final, que dure al menos 15 minutos. No es lo mismo eso que ‘scrollear’ dos horas sin rumbo”, ejemplifica.\nLa propuesta es clara: involucrarse, poner límites, generar espacios sin pantallas (aunque sean cortos) y también usar la tecnología juntos, con criterio. “Yo les muestro a mis hijos que a mí también me cuesta dejar el celular. Lo pongo en una caja, lo nombro, y eso también educa”, dice Fainboim.\nHacia una crianza digital consciente La tecnología no se irá. El tsunami ya pasó. Pero como señala Fainboim, aún podemos elegir cómo reconstruir. “Cuando los chicos entran más tarde a estas plataformas, pero con un mundo propio fortalecido, con intereses, con vínculos, quedan menos atrapados. Están menos vulnerables a la dopamina, al consumo vacío”.\nLa clave está en el equilibrio: menos hiperconectividad, más arte, deporte, naturaleza, charla. “Vamos a comprar el pan, hagamos una torta, escuchemos juntos la música que le gusta, aunque no entendamos nada. Ese tipo de cosas hacen una diferencia”, concluye Steinberg.\n¿Querés ver la conversación completa? Buscá el video en el canal de YouTube de Infobae. Una charla necesaria, incómoda y urgente para entender qué está pasando con nuestras infancias y cómo podemos –y debemos– hacer algo al respecto.",
