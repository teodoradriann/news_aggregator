    "text": "48 Los modernos golpes de Estado no se dan con militares y tanques, sino con sentencias y togas. Quienes quieren pervertir el sistema democrático y alcanzar de manera ilegítima el poder que no consiguen mediante las urnas recurren a la justicia. La mayor parte de las veces, con connivencia de algunos jueces dispuestos a aplicar las normas del modo más favorable a sus intereses políticos. La carta por la que el presidente del Gobierno anunciaba su hartazgo frente a los ataques que sufre su familia no menciona a los jueces, sino a sus oponentes políticos. Sabe que debe evitar minar la confianza en la justicia y con ello demuestra un sentido del Estado que no tiene nuestra propia judicatura. Porque no hay duda de que la admisión de la denuncia contra Begoña Gómez es el último de los recientes casos de lawfare que ensucian nuestra política y que tanto están dañando al Estado de derecho español. En España la utilización política de los tribunales no sigue los parámetros latinoamericanos, donde a menudo los jueces son directamente comprados por potencias extranjeras u oligarquías locales para descabalgar a los gobiernos progresistas incómodos. Aquí la cúpula judicial ha sido siempre elegida a dedo por un órgano –el CGPJ– controlado por el Partido Popular. Los jueces del Supremo han sido nombrados en su mayoría por ese partido y al menos con su connivencia. Es, además, un colectivo cada vez más conservador y a menudo ultraderechista. Y, por si fuera poco, mayoritariamente le da menos importancia a su propia imparcialidad que el resto de sus colegas europeos.",

    "text": "Two-time Masters winner Scottie Scheffler is taking the opportunity to plan a Texas-style menu for this year’s Masters Tournament dinner, according to reports.\nScheffler has the honor of arranging the menu for the “Masters Club” dinner, which was first held in 1952 in honor of golf legend Ben Hogan.\nThe tradition has carried over to today, when the current Green Jacket winner is given the task of planning next year’s dinner, Fox News reported.\nScheffler also won the famed tournament in 2022, and for the 2023 dinner, he served the club an all-American meal of cheeseburger sliders, firecracker shrimp, and beef steak.\nReports say shrimp is back this year, and so are sliders. The menu will also include “Papa Scheff’s Meatball and Ravioli Bites. ”\nThe meal for the April 7 tournament will also include steak and fish, for those who are not fond of meat. There will also be chili.\nScheffler is scheduling a chocolate chip cookie skillet topped with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert.\n“It’s my favorite food, hasn’t quite changed too much, but there’s a little bit, I would say, more kind of nostalgic stuff,” Scheffler explained.\n“It should be a fun night, fun meal, and I’m very excited about being able to host a Champion’s Dinner again, and very excited to see how it’s prepared and what the chefs at Augusta pull off this year. I’m really looking forward to it,” he added.\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston , X at WTHuston , or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston .",

    "text": "Still wearing an eye patch, Springfield Police Officer Nestor Santos waved to several banks of uniformed officers outside Massachusetts General Hospital as he left. \"We're extremely grateful for the heroic doctors and nurses and the miracles that work at the Mass. General Hospital for their hard work, their skills, their training. Officer Santos is going home to his family today,\" Springfield Police Capt. Brian Keenan said. Santos was shot in the face and the leg in third of the three shootings late last Wednesday in a chaotic scene that spread across Springfield. Two Massachusetts Department of Transportation workers were hurt as well, one seriously, by a car carrying three people believed to be involved in one of the shootings, police have said.

He's suspected of shooting Santos, who was driving to work at the time, with an AR-15-style rifle from a Jeep around 11 p.m. on State Street near Hunter Place, Springfield police have said. That shooting followed two others in quick succession, the first on College Street at about 10:40 p.m., according to police. They said people in a Honda Civic opened fire on Springfield police detectives in the firearms investigation unit, none of whom was injured. Two minutes later, and a minute before the off-duty officer was shot, people in the Jeep shot at detectives who were searching for the first vehicle, Police Superintendent Lawrence Akers has said. Their cruiser was hit five times but the officers were able to escape unscathed. The people who opened fire \"had no regard for life,\" Akers said last week.",
