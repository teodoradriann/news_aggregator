    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted.\nLeo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital.\nThere has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city.\nThat scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school.\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar made the comments during his end of year media briefing (Niall Carson/PA) Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected.\nMr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists.\n“There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said.\n“If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world.\n“But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places.\n“(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.”\nA burned out bus is removed from O’Connell Street in Dublin in the aftermath of violent scenes in the city centre on November 23 (Brian Lawless/PA) Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician.\n“Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed.\n“The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.\n“Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else.\n“While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",

    "title": "Tragic story behind Britain's first ever named storm... and how unexpected gale changed the Met Office forever | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "With Britain now well into storm season, we can often take Met Office warnings for granted as they seem to be issued on an almost-daily basis over winter. But the history of weather alerts and the iconic Shipping Forecast broadcast by BBC Radio 4 each day can be traced back more than 150 years to 1859 in the early days of the forecasting agency - after a devastating storm smashed across the Irish Sea. The 'Royal Charter Gale' struck without warning on October 25 that year, killing 800 people and destroying 133 ships including the vessel that later gave it its name. Wind speeds in the Mersey were the highest ever recorded at the time, and twice as many people were lost at sea around the British Isles than in the whole of 1858. The storm - the most severe to hit the Irish Sea in the 19th century - inspired Met Office founder Captain Robert FitzRoy to start a national storm warning system. The Royal Charter Gale is thought to be the first major example in meteorological history of a sizeable UK storm named after something. Unlike today, storms were not named in advance, but often gained a name due to impacts after the event. While other storms may have been named after vessels that sank and the 'Great Storm' of 1703 had an even bigger impact with up to 15,000 killed, the Royal Charter Gale is thought to have retained notoriety because of Fitzroy's work after the event. Some 133 ships were destroyed in the 'Royal Charter Gale' of October 1859 – the most famous being the steam clipper Royal Charter, which sunk off the coast of Anglesey in North Wales An original charts produced by Met Office founder Robert FitzRoy to depict the Royal Charter Storm. The length of the line indicates wind speed, while red and blue shows pressure and temperature and weather conditions such as rain are shown by markings in small boxes FitzRoy, who had a respected naval background and later became a Vice Admiral, was chosen to set up the Met Office in 1854 amid hopes that better forecasting in the Atlantic Ocean could help protect people at sea. Early meteorologists collected daily weather data at 9am at stations around the British and Irish coasts and sent them to the Met Office by telegraph. These readings including pressure, temperature, wind direction and force, cloud amount and conditions such as rain, thunder or fog. But with forecasting still only in its infancy, five years after the Met Office had begun operations the Royal Charter Gale hit with winds estimated at well over 100mph. The storm tracked northwards over Britain from Cornwall to the Yorkshire coast, but the strongest winds developed as a narrow stream from the north over the Irish Sea. Some 90 ships were badly damaged and 133 were destroyed – the most famous being the steam clipper Royal Charter, which sunk off the coast of Anglesey in North Wales. The vessel, which could carry up to 600 passengers and was well-known for its speed at the time, had been completing a two-month journey from Melbourne to Liverpool. The Royal Charter, which could carry up to 600 passengers and was well-known for its speed at the time, had been completing a two-month journey from Melbourne to Liverpool As conditions deteriorated in the Irish Sea, the captain decided to carry on for Liverpool despite having the option to seek shelter at Holyhead during the storm. But the winds picked up further and the Liverpool Pilot could not reach the ship – meaning they were forced to anchor. However, the port anchor chain then snapped before the starboard chain followed one hour later. Crew cut the masts to reduce wind drag, but the Royal Charter was driven inshore and struck the rocks at Point Alerth before quickly breaking up while being battered by massive waves. An official death toll was never confirmed because the passenger list was lost in the wreck, but it was estimated at 459 including every woman and child on board. Only 40 people survived what remains the deadliest shipwreck ever on the Welsh coast. After the wreck, attention turned to avoiding a repeat – and Fitzroy produced a report to prove how the storm could have been tracked. The Royal Charter Gale inspired Met Office founder Captain Robert FitzRoy (above) - captain of HMS Beagle during Charles Darwin's famous voyage - to start a national storm warning system He claimed that his forecasting models could be used for a national storm warning system – and despite initial scepticism among some scientists that such a prediction service would work, the Government allowed him to set it up. The Met Office began collecting weather reports at its London offices in September 1860 via electric telegraph, and its first storm warning was issued in February 1861. Workers advised ships both in the harbour and along the coast of the incoming storm by using a combination of cones and drums hoisted on a staff. FitzRoy also produced a booklet for ship captains to understand his warning signals, and another explaining how to interpreting changes in a barometer which was used by those operating from smaller ports without the signals. The warning was ignored on the Tyne which wrecked more than 200 ships and resulted in fatalities, but further warnings were then acknowledged and the system soon became popular. FitzRoy produced this guide to help ship captains understand his storm warning signals FitzRoy – who was best known as captain of HMS Beagle during Charles Darwin's famous voyage - tragically killed himself in 1865, with the warning service then halted amid concerns over its scientific basis. However it was restarted in 1867 following a campaign in Parliament and the media. And the system still operates to this day, broadcast as the Shipping Forecast four times a day on Radio 4 at 0.48am, 5.20am, 12.01am and 5.54pm. There is also now the added bonus of storm names, which the Met Office began in 2015 - running annually from September until August the following year. The Met Office brought in the names for storms for when they have the potential to cause disruption or damage which could result in an amber or red warning. They say the idea is to use a 'single authoritative system' to provide a 'consistent message' which helps the communication of approaching severe weather through the media and other government agencies to help keep people said. Forecasters hope that naming severe storms makes people more aware of them, and also helps people follow the progress on TV, radio and in publications. The first daily forecast produced in 1861, which was also the year of the first storm warning A decision was made by the Met Office to start giving storms names in 2014 to mirror the process in the US. The first storm to be named was Abigail on November 10, 2015. Speaking about the importance of the Royal Charter Gale in the history of the Met Office, the organisation's archivist Catherine Ross told MailOnline: 'The Met Office began forecasting following the disastrous Royal Charter Gale of October 1859 which claimed 800 lives in total. 'Following the storm Admiral Robert FitzRoy, founder of the Met Office, applied to Parliament to start a national Gale Warning service. 'This used the telegraph network to transmit information quickly and a system of canvas shapes hung from masts to communicate with shipping in an era well before the birth of radio. 'Over time the gale warnings evolved into the iconic Shipping Forecast. His warnings saved countless lives. 'Today the Met Office continues to help people stay safe and thrive with our National Severe Weather Warnings and also with the naming of storms to aid in communicating severe weather to the public.'",

    "title": "Former CIA employee sentenced to 40 years in prison after carrying out largest data leak in agency's history - KAKE",
    "text": "By Rob Frehse and Mark Morales, CNN\n(CNN) — A former CIA employee was sentenced to 40 years in prison after carrying out the largest data leak in the agency’s history, the US Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York announced Thursday.\nJoshua Schulte – who was accused of handing over reams of classified data to WikiLeaks in 2016 – was convicted in 2022 of illegally gathering and transmitting national defense information and obstructing a criminal investigation and grand jury proceeding, among other charges. He was also found guilty in 2023 of receiving, possessing and transporting child pornography, according to the US Attorney’s Office.\nHe had worked as a computer engineer within the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, and created cyber tools that could grab data undetected from computers. Schulte defended himself at trial. An earlier trial ended in a hung jury in 2020.\n“Joshua Schulte betrayed his country by committing some of the most brazen, heinous crimes of espionage in American history,” US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. “He caused untold damage to our national security in his quest for revenge against the CIA for its response to Schulte’s security breaches while employed there.”\n“When the FBI caught him, Schulte doubled down and tried to cause even more harm to this nation by waging what he described as an ‘information war’ of publishing top secret information from behind bars,” Williams added. “And all the while, Schulte collected thousands upon thousands of videos and images of children being subjected to sickening abuse for his own personal gratification.”\n“Today, Joshua Schulte was rightly punished not only for his betrayal of our country, but for his substantial possession of horrific child pornographic material,” FBI assistant director in charge James Smith said in a statement. “The severity of his actions is evident, and the sentence imposed reflects the magnitude of the disturbing and harmful threat posed by his criminal conduct.”\nSchulte’s issues at the CIA began in the summer of 2015 when he began to feud with management and a co-worker, ultimately filing a restraining order against the co-worker in state court, court records show. Schulte and the co-worker were both transferred as a result of the feud.\nInvestigators alleged that Schulte became enraged when CIA officials wanted to hire a contractor to build a cyber tool similar to one he was building, prosecutors said.\nA year later, investigators said Schulte stole cyber tools and source code and transferred them to WikiLeaks , according to court records. He then tried to cover his tracks, erasing any and all traces of him accessing the computer system, prosecutors said.\nSchulte quit the CIA in November 2016. But in March 2017, WikiLeaks published the first installment of its Vault 7 leaks , which originated from two programs that Schulte had access to, court records show.",

    "title": "#54 Valencianos explotan contra una nueva actividad para turistas en la que recorren la ciudad bailando",
    "text": "[NPC1](/user/NPC1)a [lavanguardia.com](/go/link/3974042)\n¿Como de subnormal hay que ser para pagar por mostrar a una ciudad de un millón de habitantes lo subnormal que eres?\n[#4](c4#c-4) a mí esto me suena a felicidad impostada. A Mr Wonderfull, a querer tapar una fuga de agua con buenas intenciones, a Teletubbies modernos. Pero que sabré yo que soy un triste\n[#4](c4#c-4) Eso digo yo, otra cosa sería que lo hicieran con música en altavoces. Si a la gente no le importa hacer el ridículo, y se lo pasan bien así, por mi perfecto.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Depende de cuantos sean y por dónde pasen, supongo. Si se meten en medio de la plaza de la reina o delante del palau de la música y son 25 personas caben tranquilamente, pero si se meten esos mismos 25 en una acera de 3 metros como se ve en la captura... pues joden 15m de acera \"a su ritmo\" por la puta cara.\nHace años ya se liaron pollos con los segway, porque ni contaminan ni hacen ruido, pero cuando van unos cuantos juntos colapsan calles y cruces.\n[#14](c14#c-14) porque seguramente moleste al resto, tu ves un grupo de flipados bailando, te mererias en su camino? pasarias entre ellos? le dejarías paso a todos priorizandolos?\nTampoco hay que pensar mucho para darse cuenta que es una molestia\n[#4](c4#c-4) Pues sí. Esa parece la moda, criticar a una de las actividades que más ingresos generan en este país. Otra cosa que sí es criticable es la actitud de la gente, la mala educación, etc. Pero eso desgraciadamente lo padecemos a diario en todos los ámbitos, en el trabajo, en la calle, en el supermercado, etc. No es exclusivo del turismo. Pero vamos, que si tan malo es puede que tengamos que reorientar la producción hacia el sector primario.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Actividad económica que genera beneficios para pocos y molestias para muchos, atrae trabajadores con sueldos míseros y provoca un encarecimiento sin precedentes de los alquileres. Dear tourist enjoy balconing.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Mucho amargado que no tiene un duro para irse de vacaciones y en vez de cagarse en la madre que pario a su empresa que le paga una mierda, se desahoga odiando turistas\n[#4](c4#c-4) Estoy de acuerdo pero... No es lo mismo una persona con auriculares bailando por la calle que un grupo de diez o veinte, con \"coreografías\" y ocupando todo el espacio. Sin ver ningún vídeo es difícil opinar, pero por lo leído tiene que ser un poquito incordiante.\n[#4](c4#c-4) No es quejarse por quejarse, mucha gente si, pero otros no tanto.\nVivo en mallorca y mi ingresos vienen gracias al turismo.\nAún así, hay que reconocer que no todo vale. Ya que hay actividades que pueden ser muy guays para los turistas pero realmente molestas para la gente que vive en la zona.\nPor ejemplo, aquí se han limitado los tours de buggies y motos de agua. Debido a que hacen un tour cada hora durante 8 horas por los mismos caminos y calas. Para la gente que vive en las zonas de paso es insoportable.\nY volviendo a la noticia, realmente es muy molesto los grupos de turistas. Como cruceristas, estos bailando, etc, debido a que no es lo mismo 50 turistas paseando a su bola que 50 turistas haciendo lo mismo, los segundos bloquean por completo.\nY el problema no es que haya 1 grupo, es que hay 3-4 grupos cada hora.\nLas críticas que yo defiendo son contra la masificación, no se puede todo para todos.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Quejarse del turismo puede tener sentido, porque en muchos sitios es excesivo. Pero no habría que quejarse al turista, que poca o ninguna culpa tiene, sino más bien a los que se están lucrando con los alquileres turísticos (y de paso, dificultando el acceso a la vivienda) y a los gobiernos que lo permiten.\nPero claro, siempre es más fácil echar la culpa al débil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) En el Retiro hay muchos, además de estos, haciendo flashmobing, k-pop, influencers y demás. Un par de broncas he tenido por pasar por donde están haciendo sus movidas, pero me la suda. Me empiezo a parecer al señor que se sienta en el banco del parque detrás de la streamer: \"Your followers? Oh, are you Jesus now, are you?\"\nEnésimo artículo de mierda sobre el tema cansino del verano para que la gente haga el clic correspondiente y el periódico gane dinerito, que está la cosa mu achuchá.\nHay que ser imbécil o tener un problema mental para que te moleste que haya gente bailando sin hacer ruido.\nA ver, si no molestan con auriculares no me parece mal. Que los frivolos guiris se diviertan como quieran.",

    "text": "The national capital continued to reel under dense fog cover on Friday as visibility plunged, delaying train and flight services. A red alert has been issued for dense fog in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the fog conditions at the Indira Gandhi International Airport registered an improvement on Friday, compared to the last two days. The lowest visibility on Friday morning is at 150m and the Runway Visual Range (RVR) is in at range of 400m to 800m, reported ANI.\nOver the last three days, nearly 60 flights were diverted and scores were delayed due to the fog. Airport sources said a total of 58 flights, the majority of them operated by domestic carriers, were diverted due to bad weather between 0000 hours of December 25 to 0600 hours of December 28.\nThe situation was no different at the New Delhi Railway Station where 22 trains were delayed on Friday. \"The trains are later than usual this time. The Nandankanan Express coming to Delhi from Bhubaneswar was supposed to reach at 3.30 pm but it reached Delhi at 12.30 am,\" a passenger Prashant Kumar told ANI.\nThe situation is likely to continue over the next few days, the IMD said. \"Very dense fog in isolated pockets of Jammu-Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana-Chandigarh, U.P, west Rajasthan; moderate to dense fog in isolated pockets of Delhi, East Raj; Shallow to moderate fog in isolated pockets of West M.P, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar,\" a post by the IMD read.\nThe minimum temperature is expected to hover around seven to eight degrees Celsius, the weather department said on Thursday.\n\"Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 8.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above the season's average, while the maximum temperature settled at 21.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal,\" according to the IMD.\nIn an advisory for dense fog, the department has asked drivers to use fog lights and travellers to stay updated on the schedules of airlines, railways and state transport. \"Exercise caution while driving or using any mode of transportation,\" the IMD said.\nThe Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data stated that Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Thursday settled at 358.",

    "title": "Israel-Gaza War: Hamas Accepts Ceasefire Proposal Of Egypt, Qatar",
    "text": "- By Reuters - Published: Mon, 06 May 2024 10:50 PM (IST) - Source:Reuters Militant group Hamas on Monday agreed to a ceasefire proposal in the seven-month-old war with Israel in Gaza, hours after the Israeli military told residents to evacuate some parts of Rafah, which has been sheltering more than a million displaced people. Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that the group accepted their ceasefire proposal, according to a brief statement from Hamas, which gave no details of the accord. There was no immediate comment from Israel. The agreement, should it take effect, would be the first truce since a week-long pause in the fighting in November, and follows months of failed attempts at pausing the fighting to free hostages and allow more aid into Gaza. There had been concerns that the ceasefire talks being held in Cairo had stalled after Hamas official Izzat al-Rashiq warned that any Israeli operation in Rafah would put the truce talks in jeopardy.
