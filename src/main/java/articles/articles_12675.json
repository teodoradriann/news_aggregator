    "text": "Bhopal, Dec 13 : Bone-chilling cold with icy winds continues in Madhya Pradesh as night temperatures in several districts dropped below 5 degrees Celsius on Thursday.\nPachmarhi, the only hill station in the state remained coldest at a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, while the night temperatures in Raisen, Rajgarh and Umariya districts also remained between 4.4 and 4.8 degrees Celsius.\nSimilarly, the night temperature in the capital city of Bhopal remained at 6.8 degrees Celsius for the third consecutive day. Whereas, the minimum temperature in Indore was 10 degree Celsius on Thursday night.\nDue to extreme cold, school timing in several districts, including Bhopal and Raisen were rescheduled at 9 a.m. against 7:30 a.m. on Thursday.\nThe icy winds that have impacted Gwalior-Chambal and Malwa-Nimar regions most have also reached Bhopal and other adjoining districts on Friday morning. Despite clear skies, people are experiencing a tough time.\nIcy winds have also prompted zoo authorities to step up with protective measures for birds and other wild animals.\nUttam Yadav, in charge of the Zoological garden in Indore, said the department has started putting green nets in cages for birds and lamps are also being placed to protect them from cold.\nThe Meteorological Department has predicted a cold wave in Jabalpur, Niwari, Tikamgarh, Satna, Panna, Chhatarpur, Rewa, Umariya, Bhopal, Rajgarh, Shajapur, Sehore, Sheopur, Neemach, Vidisha and several other districts on Friday.\nUsually, cold waves are experienced in the last week of December, but the cold has increased due to snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh. There may be a drop in day and night temperature during the next 48 hours.\nAccording to IMD Bhopalâ€™s senior meteorologist Divya E. Surendran, two factors are contributing to the extreme cold in Madhya Pradesh at present.\nFirstly, the high-speed winds at an altitude of 12.6 km in northwest India are bringing cold air to Madhya Pradesh. If these winds pick up speed or lower in altitude, the cold will intensify.\nSecond, a western disturbance over northern Pakistan, along with a cyclonic circulation, is causing snow to melt and cold winds to blow into the region.",

    "text": "Trinidad and Tobago Football Association (TTFA) technical director Anton Corneal was among 23 technical leaders who graduated from the first edition of Fifa’s technical-leadership diploma.\nA TTFA release on December 26 said Corneal received his diploma at a graduation ceremony at the Fifa museum in Zurich, Switzerland earlier this month after attending the final block of the 18-month course.\nCorneal, the longstanding TTFA technical director, started the programme in May 2023. In his quest to attain the diploma, he visited Brazil, Japan, the Netherlands and Spain.\nCorneal said the programme was transformative for him as it enriched his knowledge and leadership skills and heightened his understanding of the critical values that drive excellence in sport and life.\nTTFA president Kieron Edwards and Fifa’s director of global football development, Steven Martens, praised Corneal.\n“(Anton’s) achievement in completing the first-ever Fifa technical-leadership diploma is a milestone for TT football. It’s not solely a personal achievement reflecting his dedication, but also our nation’s commitment to raising the bar in football education and development,” Edwards said.\nMartens said the future of football requires expert leadership from around the world and believes the diploma will go some distance in helping Fifa to achieve that goal.\n“We’re excited to see how each graduate from the diploma will shape and influence the future of football in the years to come,” Martens said.\nFifa’s head of technical leadership, Jamie Houchen, shared similar sentiments.\n“The Fifa technical-leadership diploma is the first qualification of its kind and we truly believe it will play a huge role in the leadership of football around the world in the future,” Houchen said.\n“The first cohort of graduates are now equipped with the skills and competencies to lead the way in this area.”\nFifa president Gianni Infantino hailed Corneal and his compatriots as “trailblazers who will help Fifa member associations develop player and coaching pathways,” maintaining the focus of Fifa’s strategic objectives.\nFifa’s technical leadership diploma is expected to provide an industry-accredited qualification which supports member associations in recruiting proven talent and nurturing the game within the various associations.\nCorneal first assumed the TTFA technical director role in 2012.",

    "text": "Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye launched a virulent anti-gay tirade on Friday, saying same-sex couples should be publicly stoned.\\nHe also lashed out at Western countries that press other nations to allow gay rights or risk losing aid.\\nHomosexuality in Burundi, a conservative Christian country in East Africa, has been criminalised since 2009 with prison terms of up to two years for consensual same-sex acts.\\nInternational outcry as Uganda’s anti-gay bill signed into law\\nNdayishimiye, a Catholic, described marriage between same-sex couples as an “abominable practice”.\\n“Personally, I think if we see these kinds of individuals in Burundi, we should put them in a stadium and stone them. And it would not be a sin for those who do,” Ndayishimiye said in response to a question at a public event in the east of the country that was broadcast by Burundian media.\\nHe also criticised Western countries that urge smaller nations to allow gay marriage or risk losing aid, saying: “Let them keep their help, let them keep it.”\\nBurundians living abroad who have “chosen the devil” and practise homosexuality should “not come back”, he added.\\n\\nHomosexuality is illegal in many East African countries, which have a history of repression and stigmas against gay people, often encouraged by conservative Muslims and Christians.\\nUganda in May adopted what has been described as one of the world’s harshest laws against homosexuality, prompting outrage among rights groups and Western powers.\\nIn response, Washington has said it would remove Uganda from a key trade deal and has imposed visa restrictions on some officials, while the World Bank suspended new loans to the country.\\nThe legislation is currently being challenged at Uganda’s constitutional court.\\n\\n\\nIn March this year, Burundi charged 24 people with “homosexual practices” in a crackdown on same-sex relationships.\\nThe move followed a call by Ndayishimiye for citizens to root out homosexuality and treat gay people as “pariahs”.\\nNdayishimiye took power in June 2020 after the death of president Pierre Nkurunziza and has been lauded by the international community for slowly ending years of Burundi’s isolation under his predecessor’s chaotic and bloody rule.\\nBut he has failed to improve a wretched human rights record, and the country of 12 million people remains one of the poorest on the planet.\\n",
