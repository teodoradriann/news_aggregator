    "text": "LAI illustration\nA second case of avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, has been detected in a backyard flock in southwest Louisiana, the state Department of Agriculture and Forestry reported Thursday.\nEarlier this week, the state’s first backyard avian flu case was reported in northwest Louisiana. State officials have not identified the type of birds involved in either case but said it involves a non-commercial, “non-poultry” flock, just like the instance reported Monday.\nThe agriculture department has not provided the size of either flock, but it did say that the other potentially exposed birds in Northwest Louisiana were “depopulated” to limit spread of the virus. There has also not been a response to a question about what comprises a “non-poultry” flock.\nInfectious disease experts say the active strain of avian flu, H5N1, is highly viral, with most of its spread taking place between wild and domestic birds. The flu has also shown up in cattle that have come into contact with infected birds, which can spread the disease through their saliva, mucus and droppings.\nSo far, 61 people have tested positive for H5NI, and the large majority have not encountered serious symptoms. Louisiana’s first and only human case, diagnosed last week, is considered the first “severe” case , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That unidentified person contracted the flu from a bird, officials said.\nNone of Louisiana’s poultry or dairy farms have reported avian flu cases. Nationally, the outbreak has affected 865 herds through 16 states this year and nearly 124 million poultry throughout 49 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nOriginally published on lailluminator.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .\nRecommended for you Most Popular Articles Images Videos Commented Articles No. 11 SRU falls to No. 2 Ferris State in Division II semifinals If you purchased a telescope from January 1, 2005 to September 6, 2023, you may be entitled to a payment from a $32 million class action settlement.

    "title": "The International Space Station May be Too Clean - But These Microbes Could Help",
    "text": "One would think that astronauts’ living quarters in space need to be perfectly sterilized, but it turns out that creating a \"dirtier\" environment with more microbes from Earth may boost their health.\nNew research has shown that the International Space Station (ISS) is overly sterile, and while this may not sound like an issue, it carries some surprising consequences; the sterile nature of the station has led to a low diversity of microbes, which could be what is causing astronauts to develop health complications like immune dysfunction, skin rashes, and other inflammatory conditions while in space.\nA study recently published in the journal\nCell00108-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001084%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) analyzed samples that were collected by astronauts, finding inadequate microbial diversity compared to human-occupied environments on Earth. Introducing environmental microbes from Earth into the ISS, the study suggests, may help stave off health problems that are often experienced by the astronauts living there.\nAnalyzing Bacteria on the ISS\nIn the study, researchers called on astronauts to swab 803 different surfaces on the ISS, which gathered 100 times more samples than previous surveys have examined. The samples returned to Earth, where they were analyzed to determine the presence of bacterial species and chemicals. The researchers then constructed 3D maps that displayed where each sample was found on the station and how the bacteria and chemicals might be interacting.\nThe results, detailed in a\nstatement, showed that human skin was the primary source of microbes in the ISS and that chemicals from cleaning products and disinfectants were present all throughout the station. Certain microbial communities were also present in different areas of the station — the dining and food prep areas contained more food-associated microbes, while the space toilet contained more urine- and fecal-associated microbes and metabolites.\nRead More:\nMicrobes in Yellowstone Thermal Pools Could Shed Light on Ancient Life\nThe Benefits of Microbes\nThe ISS, however, is missing microbes from natural environments that bolster human health.\nMost microbes — which live all around us and even populate our own skin and gut — aren’t out to harm humans; many actually provide health benefits like helping to digest food into nutrients and fighting diseases. Being in nature can support the positive growth of one’s microbiome, the community of microorganisms that coexist with us and live inside our bodies.\nCompared to natural environments on Earth, where beneficial microbes reside in soil and water, the ISS lacks diverse microbial communities. The samples were more akin to those found in industrialized, isolated environments like hospitals and closed habitats.\nThe researchers claim that introducing microbes from Earth could potentially reinforce the microbial community on the ISS without posing any hygienic risks to astronauts.\n“Future built environments, including space stations, could benefit from intentionally fostering diverse microbial communities that better mimic the natural microbial exposures experienced on Earth, rather than relying on highly sanitized spaces,” said co-first author Rodolfo Salido of the University of California, San Diego.\nKeeping Astronauts Healthy\nFuture studies will be geared toward the detection of pathogenic (or disease-spreading) microbes and signals of human health from environmental\nmetabolites, small molecules that are products of cellular metabolism. An enhanced understanding of these factors will help scientists decide how to move forward, potentially encouraging healthier living spaces for astronauts and people working in similarly sterile places here on Earth.\n“If we really want life to thrive outside Earth, we can't just take a small branch of the tree of life and launch it into space and hope that it will work out,” said Salido. “We need to start thinking about what other beneficial companions we should be sending with these astronauts to help them develop ecosystems that will be sustainable and beneficial for all.”\nRead More:\nMicrobes Can Colonize Space, Produce Drugs, and Create Energy\nArticle Sources\nOur writers at\n Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

    "text": "Jude Bellingham Matches Lionel Messi’s Record During Real Madrid vs RB Salzburg\nJude Bellingham matched a Lionel Messi feat during\nReal Madrid's latest UEFA Champions League win against RB Salzburg. Bellingham bagged two assists as Carlo Ancelotti's side managed a dominant 5-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu on January 22.\nThe Englishman assisted both of Rodrygo's goals during the match in an impressive display. Apart from Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr scored a brace and Kylian Mbappe found the back of the net for the Madrid giants.\nBellingham, meanwhile, continued his rich vein of form following a slow start to his season. The 21-year-old has now managed nine goals and nine assists in 27 appearances across competitions this season.\nMeanwhile, he now has 11 goals and 13 assists in 41 UEFA Champions League appearances, taking his goal contribution to 24. Lionel Messi managed 24 goals and assists before turning 22 with 17 goals and seven assists to his name.\nBellingham is now 21 years and six months, meaning he could surpass the Argentine icon. He could also get past former teammate Erling Haaland, who managed 26 goal contributions before turning 22.\nBellingham's current Real Madrid teammate Kylian Mbappe, though, leads the line for most UCL goal contributions for players aged 21 or under. Mbappe managed 37 goal contributions for AS Monaco and PSG.\nCourtesy of their win against Salzburg, Real Madrid managed to move to the 16th spot in the UEFA Champions League table. They now have 12 points from seven matches with four wins. Los Blancos will take on Brest in their final league game of the competition's new format.\nThe Latest Real Madrid News:\nTranscript: Carlo Ancelotti’s Post-Match Press Conference Following Real Madrid's Champions League Win Opta Calculates Real Madrid's Chances Of Winning The 2025 Champions League Real Madrid Transfer News: Alexander-Arnold, Vinicius Jr, Fernandez, Murillo & More - January 23, 2025 Vinicius Jr Reacts After Reaching 100 Goals For Real Madrid Against RB Salzburg",
