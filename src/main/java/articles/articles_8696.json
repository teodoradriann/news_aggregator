    "text": "在山东荣成市黄山王家村，有一片郁郁葱葱的红松树林，格外引人注目。红松有“北国宝树”的美誉，主要分布在东北长白山到小兴安岭一带，可生长在东北的红松为什么在荣成市得以繁育且成林成片呢？这得从村里的一位81岁老人——宋忠华说起。\n记者找到宋忠华老人时，他正在红松林里忙活着。虽已年至耄耋，但精神矍铄，谈及与红松树的缘分宋忠华打开了话匣子。1965年，他随母亲去吉林临江市生活，第一次看到红松，那高大挺拔的身姿一下子就印在了他的心里。\n从2004年起，宋忠华回到家乡山东荣成市虎山镇黄山王家村租赁了一片荒地，开始了漫长而艰辛的种树历程。他托朋友从吉林临江市寄来了约14万粒红松种子，满心期待着它们在家乡生根发芽。由于南北气温土壤条件差异大，红松树“水土不服”，第一年的成苗率仅有7%。面对这样的结果，宋忠华没有退缩，他买来专业书籍钻研学习，还四处向林业专家请教，终于摸索出一套自己的种植方法。\n2013年，看着培育成功的红松茁壮成长，宋忠华有了新的想法，捐赠移栽红松树，让更多的红松树在家乡向上而生。\n多年来，他累计无偿捐赠红松树4980棵，价值近百万元。如今，81岁的宋忠华依然忙碌在红松林间。",

    "text": "Spinal Cord's Memory Function Surpasses Previous Assumptions\nBrainless Memory Makes The Spinal Cord Smarter Than Previously Thought\nAuthor:\n[Article 1: RIKEN. Article 2: Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie](#referencepr)\nPublished: 2024/04/11\nPublication Type: Experimental Study - Peer-Reviewed: Yes\nContents:\n[Summary](#summary) - [Main](#main) - [Related Publications](/disability/types/spinal-2/)\nSynopsis: New research demonstrates the autonomous learning and memory capabilities of spinal cord neurons, highlighting their independence from cerebral control. The role of the spinal cord is often simplified to that of a simple relay station, carrying messages between the brain and the body. However, the spinal cord can actually learn and remember movements on its own. Not only do these results challenge the prevailing notion that motor learning and memory are solely confined to brain circuits, but we showed that we could manipulate spinal cord motor recall, which has implications for therapies designed to improve recovery after spinal cord damage.\nMain Digest\nThis important experimental study is covered in two seperate, but similar, papers as identified below.\nPaper One\nAya Takeoka at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science (CBS) in Japan and colleagues have discovered the neural circuitry in the\n[spinal cord](/disability/types/spinal/spine-picture.php) that allows brain-independent motor learning. Published in Science on April 11, 2024, the study found two critical groups of spinal cord neurons, one necessary for new adaptive learning, and another for recalling adaptations once they have been learned. The findings could help scientists develop ways to assist motor recovery after spinal cord injury.\nScientists have known for some time that motor output from the spinal cord can be adjusted through practice even without a brain. This has been shown most dramatically in headless insects, whose legs can still be trained to avoid external cues. Until now, no one has figured out exactly how this is possible, and without this understanding, the phenomenon is not much more than a quirky fact. As Takeoka explains:\n\"Gaining insights into the underlying mechanism is essential if we want to understand the foundations of movement automaticity in healthy people and use this knowledge to improve recovery after\n[spinal cord injury](/disability/types/spinal/).\"\nBefore jumping into the neural circuitry, the researchers first developed an experimental setup that allowed them to study mouse spinal cord adaptation, both learning and recall, without input from the brain. Each test had an experimental mouse and a control mouse whose hindlegs dangled freely. If the experimental mouse's hindleg drooped down too much it was electrically stimulated, emulating something a mouse would want to avoid. The control mouse received the same stimulation at the same time, but not linked to its own hindleg position.\nAfter just 10 minutes, they observed motor learning only in the experimental mice; their legs remained high up, avoiding any electrical stimulation. This result showed that the spinal cord can associate an unpleasant feeling with leg position and adapt its motor output so that the leg avoids the unpleasant feeling, all without any need for a brain. Twenty-four hours later, they repeated the 10-minute test but reversed the experimental and control mice. The original experimental mice still kept their legs up, indicating that the spinal cord retained a memory of the past experience, which interfered with new learning.\nHaving thus established both immediate learning, as well as memory, in the spinal cord, the team then set out to examine the neural circuitry that makes both possible. They used six types of transgenic mice, each with a different set of spinal neurons disabled, and tested them for motor learning and learning reversal. They found that mice hindlimbs did not adapt to avoid the electrical shocks after neurons toward the top of the spinal cord were disabled, particularly those that express the gene Ptf1a.\nWhen they examined the mice during learning reversal, they found that silencing the Ptf1a-expressing neurons had no effect. Instead, a group of neurons in the bottom, ventral, part of the spinal cord that express the En1 gene was critical. When these neurons were silenced the day after learning avoidance, the spinal cords acted as if they had never learned anything. The researchers also assessed memory recall on the second day by repeating the initial learning conditions. They found that in wildtype mice, hindlimbs stabilized to reach the avoidance position faster than they did on the first day, indicating recall. Exciting the En1 neurons during recall increased this speed by 80%, indicating enhanced motor recall.\n\"Not only do these results challenge the prevailing notion that motor learning and memory are solely confined to brain circuits,\" says Takeoka, \"but we showed that we could manipulate spinal cord motor recall, which has implications for therapies designed to improve recovery after spinal cord damage.\"\nPaper Two\nWired to Learn and Remember\nA team of researchers at the Leuven-based Neuro-Electronics Research Flanders (NERF) details how two different neuronal populations enable the spinal cord to adapt and recall learned behavior in a way that is completely independent of the brain. These remarkable findings, published in Science, shed new light on how spinal circuits might contribute to mastering and automating movement. The insights could prove relevant in the rehabilitation of people with spinal injuries.\nThe Spinal Cord's Puzzling Plasticity\nThe spinal cord modulates and finetunes our actions and movements by integrating different sources of sensory information, and it can do so without input from the brain. What's more, nerve cells in the spinal cord can learn to adjust various tasks autonomously, given sufficient repetitive practice. How the spinal cord achieves this remarkable plasticity, however, has puzzled neuroscientists for decades.\nOne such neuroscientist is Professor Aya Takeoka. Her team at Neuro-Electronics Research Flanders (NERF, a research institute backed by imec, KU Leuven and VIB) studies how the spinal cord recovers from injuries by exploring how the nerve connections are wired, and how they function and change when we learn new movements.\n\"Although we have evidence of 'learning' within the spinal cord from experiments dating back as early as the beginning of the 20th century, the question of which neurons are involved and how they encode this learning experience has remained unanswered,\" says Prof. Takeoka.\nPart of the problem is the difficulty in directly measuring the activity of individual neurons in the spinal cord in animals that are not sedated but awake and moving. Takeoka's team took advantage of a model in which animals train specific movements within minutes. In doing so, the team uncovered a cell type-specific mechanism of spinal cord learning.\nTwo Specific Neuronal Cell Types\nTo check how the spinal cord learns, doctoral researcher Simon Lavaud and his colleagues at the Takeoka lab built an experimental setup to measure changes in movement in mice, inspired by methods used in insect studies.\n\"We evaluated the contribution of six different neuronal populations and identified two groups of neurons, one dorsal and one ventral, that mediate motor learning.\"\n\"These two sets of neurons take turns,\" explains Lavaud. \"The dorsal neurons help the spinal cord learn a new movement, while the ventral neurons help it remember and perform the movement later.\"\n\"You can compare it to a relay race within the spinal cord. The dorsal neurons act like the first runner, passing on the critical sensory information for learning. Then, the ventral cells take the baton, ensuring the learned movement is remembered and executed smoothly.\"\nLearning and Memory Outside The Brain\nThe detailed results, published in this week's edition of Science, illustrate that neuronal activity in the spinal cord resembles various classical types of learning and memory. Further unravelling these learning mechanisms will be crucial, as they likely contribute to different ways in which we learn and automate movement, and may also be relevant in the context of rehabilitation, says Prof. Aya Takeoka:\n\"The circuits we described could provide the means for the spinal cord to contribute to movement learning and long-term motor memory, which both help us to move, not only in normal health but especially during recovery from brain or spinal cord injuries.\"\nPublication\nTwo inhibitory neuronal classes govern acquisition and recall of spinal sensorimotor adaptation. Lavaud, et al.

    "text": "The tussle for the Kano emirship appears to be in full steam as two men, Aminu Ado Bayero and Lamido Sanusi, have asserted claims to the position and are acting as such from two different palaces. While the man reinstated by the state government, Mr Sanusi, is holding court at the main Kano emir’s palace, the man deposed by the government, Mr Ado Bayero is at the mini palace at the Nassarawa GRA both in Kano city. Mr Ado Bayero surprisingly returned from a trip to Kano on Saturday morning, a day after Mr Sanusi was formally reinstated. Mr Sanusi has been receiving greetings and homages from district heads at the. | | He rode on a horse to the chamber to the sound of multiple gun salutes from the palace guards. Hundreds of sympathisers, mostly red cap-wearing supporters of the state’s ruling New Nigeria People Party (NNPP) are being bused from the local government areas to the main emir’s palace. The movement of the people to the palace was said to be in connection with an alleged plan by federal authorities to relocate Mr Ado-Bayero to the palace. The security agencies and police have asked the state government to obey a court order halting the deposition of Mr Ado-Bayero and his colleagues in the scrapped Bichi, Karaye, Rano and Gaya emirates. The court ordered the parties involved in the crisis to maintain the status quo until the hearing of the interim injunction, scheduled for 3 June. The state government, however, faulted the order, saying the judge that granted it was outside the country when he did so. Nobody is above the law At the mini palace at Narassawa GRA, Mr Ado Bayero too has received homages from some district heads and title holders who are against his deposition. PREMIUM TIMES saw dozens of descendants of late Emir Ado Bayero rally around their brother in a show of solidarity and support as he arrived in Kano Saturday morning. Aminu Dan’agundi, a title holder and senior counsellor in Kano emirate, who filed the case in court, is also at the mini palace with Mr Ado Bayero. There, Mr Ado Bayero has urged his supporters and residents to remain calm and allow the law to take its course, saying that nobody is above the law. He said that he was confident that justice would prevail in the end. “I call on the people to remain law-abiding as we await the pronouncement from the court in this legal matter. “We call on the authority to be fair and just in this matter. Kano is like a mirror and an influential state in Nigeria, whatever affects Kano may escalate across. May peace reign in Kano. We pray for Allah to bless Kano with responsible and just leaders. “Justice is the way to go on every issue. There will be justice. Nobody is above the law. We will accept whatever the law says. I appreciate all the people who have shown concern. “We will keep on praying for peace in Kano State. May Allah the Almighty protect us,” Mr Ado Bayero said while addressing his supporters. Kano Govt blames Ganduje The Kano State Deputy Governor, Aminu Abdulsalam, blamed the confusion on the immediate past governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, who is now the National Chairman of Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The deputy governor said Mr Ganduje is using the office of the National Security Adviser to create chaos in the state by facilitating Saturday’sreturn of Mr Ado Bayero to the state. But the office of the National Security Adviser denied the allegation and warned politicians in the state to be mindful of their utterances. “It is unfortunate that the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Ganduje, is using the National Security Adviser to create tension in the state by smuggling into the state, the former emir, Aminu Ado Bayero. READ ALSO: [Sanusi speaks after reinstatement as Kano emir] “The appointment and dethronement of emir or any traditional title holder is solely the prerogative of the state government,” the deputy governor said, accusing the federal government of interference. However, Mr Ganduje’s spokesperson, Edwin Olofu, said his principal who he said was attending a meeting of APC in Nasarawa State, has no connection with the development in Kano.

Bhavish Agarwal's company, Ola Electric, may face challenges following a series of complaints regarding alleged issues with Ola electric bikes and lapses in service standards. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), which operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, has ordered a detailed investigation into the matter. CCPA Chief Commissioner and Consumer Affairs Secretary, Nidhi Khare, provided information on Thursday, stating that the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) chief has been tasked with examining the issue. Appropriate steps will be taken following the report, which was ordered on November 6, with a submission deadline set for 15 days. Also Read | [CCPA orders detailed probe into Ola Electric over consumer complaint resolution process.](https://www.lokmattimes.com/technology/ccpa-orders-detailed-probe-into-ola-electric-over-consumer-complaint-resolution-process-1/) Between September of last year and August this year, the Ministry’s National Consumer Helpline received over 10,000 complaints concerning alleged defects and poor service in e-scooters. Of these, more than 3,300 complaints were related to service delays, while approximately 1,900 involved delays in the delivery of new vehicles. Around 1,500 customers reported that promises made by the company were not being fulfilled. In response to these complaints, the CCPA issued a notice to Ola Electric on October 7, addressing several concerns, including violations of consumer rights. Ola Electric responded on October 21, claiming that 99% of customer complaints had been resolved. CEO Bhavish Agarwal stated last week that “most complaints were minor issues, such as parts loss or lack of customer knowledge about the software.\" However, after contacting some of the customers who had filed complaints, the CCPA found that most issues remained unresolved. Consequently, the CCPA requested the BIS chief to conduct a thorough investigation. Status of Ola Electric Shares Ola Electric’s shares were listed at Rs 76 on August 9, reaching a high of Rs 157 on August 20. The company’s stock closed at a low of Rs 69.62 on November 14.

    "text": "The Argentinian Jesuit visited the Rebibbia women's prison in the northeastern outskirts of the Italian capital - Copyright VATICAN MEDIA/AFP Handout Pope Francis, who often pleads for compassion to prisoners, washed the feet of 12 incarcerated women in Rome on Thursday in a rite marking Holy Thursday before Easter.\nThe Argentinian Jesuit visited the Rebibbia women’s prison in the northeastern outskirts of the Italian capital, where he performed the same rite in 2015.\nThursday, however, was the first time the 87-year-old pontiff had dedicated his annual ritual during Holy Week solely to women.\nSeated in a wheelchair, the pope washed the feet of each of the prisoners, some of them in tears, before drying them off with a towel and kissing them.\n“We all have small failures, big failures,” said the pope in an impromptu homily during a mass held in the courtyard of the prison that holds some 370 women.\n“But the Lord is always waiting for us, with open arms, and he never tires of forgiving,” he added.\nThe washing of feet is “a gesture that draws our attention to the vocation of service,” said Francis, who as a priest in Buenos Aires had already begun visiting prisoners.\nA few minutes earlier, the pontiff was all smiles as he shook hands with the inmates.\nLast month, the pope caught a flu that caused him to cancel some public meetings. During his subsequent recovery, he has on several occasions asked others to read his speeches.\nIn the Christian tradition, Holy Thursday commemorates the day when Christ washed the feet of the apostles at the Last Supper.\nIt is a highlight of Holy Week, which commemorates Christ’s final days before his resurrection on Easter.\nSince becoming pope in 2013, the head of the Catholic Church has often visited prisons and refugee centres, including last year on Holy Thursday when he visited a juvenile detention centre and washed the feet of 12 young men.\nOn Good Friday, he is due to preside over the “Way of the Cross” prayer service at Rome’s Coliseum, which he was unable to attend last year as he recovered from a bronchial infection.",
