    "title": "Trabajadoras de la residencia Sanmarkosene de Errenteria inician una huelga indefinida contra cinco despidos",
    "text": "Las trabajadoras de la residencia Sanmarkosene de Errenteria han iniciado una huelga indefinida contra el planteamiento de la empresa, que propone reducir la jornada de trabajo para 20 empleadas y plantea el despido de cinco de ellas. Los sindicatos ELA, LAB y ESK han denunciado esta \"grave situación\" que vive la residencia y han recordado que el 30 de noviembre del pasado año impulsaron la primera huelga general feminista para \"poner encima de la mesa la importancia de situar los cuidados en el centro de las políticas públicas\".\nSin embargo, han lamentado que \"esas palabras han quedado en el aire, sin traducirse en acciones concretas\". Así, han considerado que \"es hora de que los lemas políticos pasen a la práctica y se adopten medidas reales que reflejen ese compromiso con los cuidados\".\nEn la actualidad, el 36% de la plantilla de Sanmarkosene tiene jornadas parciales no voluntarias. Los sindicatos han advertido de que esto \"sigue poniendo en riesgo la atención que los usuarios se merecen e impiden la estabilidad económica de las trabajadoras, a la vez que imposibilitan la conciliación laboral y familiar de la plantilla\".\nEvitar despidos\nLas demandas principales de las trabajadoras son evitar los cinco despidos, que \"además agravarían la falta de personal y comprometerían aún más el servicio\"; garantizar contratos a tiempo completo para toda la plantilla, \"promoviendo estabilidad y continuidad en la atención\"; y acordar calendarios y horarios \"justos\" que les permitan desempeñar su labor \"en condiciones adecuadas\".\nEn esa línea, han insistido en que las instituciones \"tienen la responsabilidad de asegurar que los servicios públicos sean ejemplo de dignidad y excelencia\". \"No podemos tolerar que la empresa mercantilice el servicio publico y la rentabilidad del mismo sea el criterio que predomine derivando en una atención deficitaria y en condiciones laborales insostenibles para quienes día a día cuidan de los más vulnerables\", han remarcado.\nTras recordar que el 96% de las 130 plazas disponibles en la residencia están concertadas por la Diputación, han instado a la institución foral a \"asumir su responsabilidad, garantizar los recursos necesarios y priorizar tanto los derechos de las trabajadoras como la calidad del servicio prestado\". \"Es momento de que el compromiso político con los cuidados deje de ser un eslogan vacío y se convierta en una realidad tangible\", han añadido.\nFinalmente, han anunciado que la semana que viene seguirán con las movilizaciones diarias, con las manifestaciones de las primeras horas el lunes y miercoles y caravanas de coche el martes y jueves. Además, realizarán una manifestación el lunes a las 11.00 horas en las calles de Errenteria, partiendo de la plaza del Ayuntamiento.",

    "text": "The nominees for the 97th Academy Awards are here! Donning some eye-catching outfits, “Saturday Night Live”’s Bowen Yang and “Bottoms” actor Rachel Sennott spilled the tea on who’s in and who’s out. Unlike the suspenseful, soapy race for pope that powered best picture nominee “Conclave,” this year’s choices were mostly dull and unsurprising.\nBowen Yang and Rachel Sennott speak onstage during the 97th Oscar nominations announcement at Samuel Goldwyn Theater on Jan. 23 in Beverly Hills, Calif. Handout/The Academy via Getty Images I can’t recall a year where I’ve been less interested in the outcome of the Oscars. But I’ll save most of my kvetching for my Oscar predictions next month. For now, I’ll stick to the details.\nControversial musical “Emilia Pérez” led the pack with 13 nominations, including best picture, director, a history-making actress nomination for Karla Sofia Gascón (the first trans person nominated in this category), supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, adapted screenplay, and two of the five song nominees.\nAdvertisement\nAdrien Brody in \"The Brutalist.\" A24 Not too far behind was the immigrant drama “The Brutalist.” Not even an AI-based controversy , regarding enhancements made to the film’s Hungarian accents and some generated drawings, could prevent it from receiving 10 nominations, including best picture, actor, supporting actor, supporting actress, and original screenplay. Its earworm of a score also received a nod.\nWith Oscars voters, “Wicked” proved to be, well, popular! The first part of the beloved Broadway musical adaptation also scored 10 nods, including best picture, best actress (Cynthia Erivo), and best supporting actress (Ariana Grande). Alas, “Wicked” apparently directed itself; John M. Chu did not make the cut.\nA movie on my 10-worst list ( “A Complete Unknown” ) and one on my 10-best list ( “Conclave” ) scored eight nominations each. They’re both up for best picture, actor, and supporting actress. If Timothée Chalamet wins, he’ll unseat fellow nominee Adrien Brody as the youngest best actor winner. Methinks the Academy will be calling him by his name come Oscar night.\nI was right when I said one of the DGA nominees would be dropped in favor of nominee Coralie Fargeat ( “The Substance” ), but I had the wrong director! I chose “A Complete Unknown”‘s James Mangold; the unlucky guy was “Conclave” helmer Edward Berger. When Mangold’s name was announced, Bob Dylan appeared in my apartment, pointed at me, and yelled, “How does it F L?!”\nAdvertisement\nIt feels like the worst nomination of the top-of-the-line categories, Bob.\nDemi Moore in \"The Substance.\" Mubi As I predicted, best actress wasn’t big enough for two comebacks OR the best performance of 2024. Comeback story Pamela Anderson and the brilliant Marianne Jean-Baptiste were passed over. Jean-Baptiste’s omission is particularly egregious — but I’m not supposed to be complaining yet! Gore-covered Substance-taker Demi Moore joins Gascón, frontrunner Mikey Madison, Erivo, and surprise nominee Fernanda Torres (“I’m Still Here”).\nDespite its original takes on directing and cinematography, my top choice for best picture of 2024, “Nickel Boys,” failed to score in either category. It did earn a best picture spot, as well as adapted screenplay. Joining the film in the latter category are “A Complete Unknown,” “Conclave,” “Emilia Pérez,” and “Sing Sing.” Clarence Maclin, who should have received a supporting actor nod, made up for it as one of the writers of “Sing Sing.”\nMaclin’s costar, the spectacular Colman Domingo, scored his second consecutive best actor nomination, after last year’s nod for “Rustin.”\nDenzel Washington’s superb, over-the-top work in “Gladiator II” wasn’t enough for a thumbs-up from Oscar voters, but don’t feel too bad for the 10-time nominee and two-time winner. Do feel bad for poor Danielle Deadwyler, who will probably win a future Oscar for a lousy performance — that’s the Oscar way!\nRalph Fiennes, left, and Stanley Tucci in \"Conclave.\" Focus Features Overall, I didn’t do too shabbily in my predictions. I had eight of 10 best picture nominees, missing “The Substance” and the one true surprise of the morning, a nod for Walter Salles’s excellent Brazilian film, “I’m Still Here.”\nOn the same percentage level, I went 4-for-5 in all the acting categories, director, international feature, and adapted screenplay. In original screenplay and animated feature, I got a perfect 5-for-5. My worst showing came in the documentary category — I had 2-for-5 because I put too much stock in the deserving “Dahomey.” Mati Diop’s excellent documentary also missed being nominated for international feature, the second of its two eligible categories.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
