    "title": "Google responds to DOJ regulators' proposal to force Chrome sale and Android restrictions",
    "text": "Image credit — PhoneArena Google has fired back in a blog post against the Department of Justice's (DOJ) recent recommendations to break up the company. The DOJ believes Google has used its dominant position in the search market to stifle competition, and they've proposed some significant changes to address these concerns. This could include Google selling off its Chrome browser and facing restrictions on how its Android operating system works with its search engine.This whole situation started with an August ruling where a federal judge concluded that Google was operating as a monopoly. The DOJ considers that strong measures are needed to level the playing field for other companies in the search market.In his blog post today, Kent Walker, Google's Chief Legal Officer, argued that the DOJ's proposals would negatively impact users. Furthermore, he claimed it could weaken privacy protections, lower the quality of Google's products, and force the company to reveal sensitive information about its technology and innovations. He also expressed concern that these changes could hinder America's global leadership in technology. DOJ chose to push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives. Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer, Google and Alphabet We have seen this before, as this isn't the first time a major tech company has faced antitrust scrutiny. Microsoft went through something similar about 25 years ago with its Windows operating system when a judge initially ruled to break up Microsoft, but that decision was later overturned. Similarly, the DOJ's recommendations for Google could be considered drastic. It wants to stop Google from making deals that set its search engine as the default on devices like iPhones and for the company to be more transparent about its advertising pricing and how it uses artificial intelligence in search results. More importantly, though, is the request for Google to break Chrome and Android up. Here's a rundown of the DOJ's key proposals: - Chrome Divestiture: Google would have to sell its Chrome web browser. - Android Restrictions: Limits would be placed on how Android can favor Google's search engine. - Search Deal Bans: Google couldn't make deals to be the default search engine on other companies' devices. - Data Licensing: Google would have to license its search index data to competitors. - AI Transparency: Google would need to provide more information about how it uses AI in search. It's unclear how this will all unfold. The judge will make the final decision, and Google could appeal if it's not in their favor. There's also a chance that the incoming Trump administration might take a different stance on antitrust issues. For me, this is a tricky situation. More competition in the search market could lead to better services, but breaking up Google could have downsides. It's important to make sure any changes are made carefully. Loading Comments...",

    "text": "As is tradition here at BroBible, we are taking a look back at the best whiskeys of the year. More specifically, we are walking down memory lane at the best whiskeys we drank this year. That includes the best bourbons, ryes, Japanese whiskeys, and other releases that we fell in love with over the past 12 months.\nThe Boss Hog X: The Commandments\nThis year’s Boss Hog release from WhistlePig is my favorite in years. Like its predecessors,\nBoss Hog X: The Commandments brings something new that’s never been done before in whiskey. It is double-finished in two unique barrels.\nFor the first finish, WhistlePig created their own experimental spirit (distillate) using frankincense and myrrh (Boswellia and Commiphora) that was seasoned into the barrels. Those resins added notes of creme brulee and rosemary to this year’s Boss Hog. And for the second finish, the Boss Hog was aged in craft mead casks which imbued it with honey, red berries, and fresh cracked black pepper.\nShop WhistlePig Here\nBooker’s Bourbon ‘Mighty Fine’ Batch\nWhen the third Booker’s Bourbon batch of 2023 came out it had many wondering how it got the name ‘\nMighty Fine Batch.’ The answer to that question is it came from the man, the myth, the legend himself: Booker Noe. It was Booker who first coined the phrase “small batch” in the bourbon industry and it was Booker who created Booker’s Batch Bourbon back in 1988.\nBooker’s Bourbon ‘Mighty Fine Batch’ clocks in at a hot 126.6 proof. It comes from bourbon aged for 7 years, 1 month, and 10 days. The breakout of this blend is:\n2% came from the 5th floor of 7-story warehouse Q\n3% came from the 6th floor of 7-story warehouse Z\n8% came from the 5th floor of 9-story warehouse G\n10% came from the 6th floor of 7-story warehouse I\n10% came from the 5th floor of 9-story warehouse H\n12% came from the 5th floor of 9-story warehouse G\n55% came from the 5th floor of 7-story warehouse 3\nShop Booker’s Bourbon Here\nArdbeg Heavy Vapours Scotch\nThis year for the annual Ardbeg Day festival the distillery released Heavy Vapours. This first-of-its-kind scotch came to exist by accident, due to a missing purifier at the Ardbeg Distillery in Port Ellen, Islay. The finished product struck a balance between “extreme peat and floral fruitiness” that was polarizing for some but I loved it from the first sip.\nShop Ardbeg Heavy Vapours Here\n2023 BTAC: The Oldest Eagle Rare 17-Year-Old Bourbon Yet\nArguably the biggest attention-grabber in the\n2023 BTAC portfolio is the Eagle Rare 17-Year-Old Bourbon. This expression is actually 19 years and 3 months old, making it the oldest Eagle Rare ever released in the 23 year history of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. If that’s confusing, ’17 Year’ is the minimum age of an Eagle Rare 17-Year-Old Bourbon but for the BTAC they can and obviously do age the barrels longer.\nThe 2023 BTAC Eagle Rare was distilled in 2004 before being aged in barrels housed in Warehouses C, I, K, M, and Q. As is tradition since Eagle Rare was launched 48 years ago, it is bottled at 101 proof. 2022’s Eagle Rare 17 was the overall winner of the 2023 American Whiskey Masters competition\nThis was the first expression of the 5 2023 BTAC portfolio that I sampled and if I had my choice of purchasing any of the five bottles, this is it. Everything about this is balanced and aged to perfection.\nShop Eagle Rare Here\nFirst-Ever Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Rye\nFor me, a lover of the heat the first-ever Cask Strength\nRye whiskey release from Angel’s Envy was huge news and it delivered on the hype. For the distillery’s first-ever Cask Strength Rye release, master distiller Owen Martin went all out. He hand-selected two rye whiskeys. One of the ryes was finished in Sauternes Casks and the other was finished in Toasted Oak barrels. They were then masterfully blended together by Owen Martin, the man behind the magic at Angel’s Envy.\nThe Cask Strength Rye is a 114.4% ABV release. Bottles of the Rye will have a suggested retail price of $269.99 and the Cask Strength Bourbon will have an SRP of $229.99.\nShop Angel’s Envy Here\nFour Roses 135th Anniversary Limited Edition Small Batch\nThe\nFour Roses Limited Edition Small Batch is one of the most highly sought after and coveted bourbon releases each year from any distillery. Bourbon aficionados go nuts for this release on any normal year but I was fortunate enough to sample the 135th Anniversary Limited Edition Small Batch and can confirm this year is something special.\nAs is the case each year, there are 4 liquid streams in the final blend. This year’s Limited Edition Small Batch includes 3 of the 10 Four Roses recipes, with 2 of the bourbon components sharing the same recipe but aged 4 years apart.\n- OESV 12-Year (Recipe 06) – 35% of the final blend\n- OESK 14-Year (Recipe 07) – 40% of the final blend\n- OESV 16-Year (Recipe 06) – 20% of the final blend\n- OBSV 25-Year (Recipe 01) – 5% of the final blend\nIf you can still find a bottle of this I highly recommend picking it up. And at the very least, treat yourself to a dram next time you see it at a bar.\nShop Four Roses Here\nRabbit Hole Distillery’s Limited-Edition 10-Year Anniversary ‘Tenniel’\nTo celebrate 10 years of exquisite whiskey, Rabbit Hole Distillery’s founder and Whiskey Maker Kaveh Zamanian\nreleased ‘Tenniel,’ an ultra-premium limited-edition bourbon that tops May’s whiskey releases.\nIn the past decade, Rabbit Hole Distillery has established itself as one of the best whiskey producers in Kentucky. And to celebrate 10 years since the brand was launched, Kaveh Zamanian wanted to release something special.\nTenniel from Rabbit Hole is a Double Barrel Cask Strength Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey which presents at a full cask strength proof of 108.8 (54.4% ABV).\nShop Rabbit Hole Here\nLittle Book Chapter 7 ‘In Retrospect’\nThe newest chapter in the\nLittle Book series features 7 distinct whiskeys masterfully blended together so that, as Freddie Noe loves to say, the finished product is greater than the sum of its individual parts. And a huge part of what makes this particular blend so special is it brings back 6 whiskeys featured in the previous Little Book chapters, one from 1-6, and a new stream for Chapter 7.\nThe full liquid stream for Little Book Chapter 7 ‘In Retrospect’ includes:\n- 18-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (from Chapter 5)\n- 17-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (from Chapter 3, Basil Hayden stream)\n- 10-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey (from Chapter 2)\n- 9-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (from Chapter 4 – not to Fred’s love of Knob Creek)\n- 5-Year-Old Straight Malt Whiskey finished in Applewood Smoked Barrels (from Chapter 6)\n- 4-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (from Chapter 1)\n- 4-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey (the new whiskey debuting in Chapter 7 — High Rye PA style)\nShop Little Book Here\nPuncher’s Chance: The Unified Belt\nThis one flew under the radar for many but Puncher’s Chance Unified Belt was a spectacular release. This was a three-cask blend of bourbon and Irish whiskey. It was made up of a 4-year-old bourbon, 4-year-old Irish whiskey, and an exquisite 14-year-old bourbon whose flavors really shined through in the final blend.\nThis award-winning whiskey clocked in at 96-proof and retails for $149 if you can find it! Start by checking out\ntheir website.\nWilderness Trail’s Limited-Edition 10-Year-Old Wheated Bourbon\nComing in just before the close of the year, Wilderness Trail’s limited-edition 10-year-old Wheated Bourbon was a spectacular close to the year. I was able to try a sample of this through a friend who secured a bottle at the distillery and it was love at first sip.\nThis is a 10-year-old wheated bourbon with a mashbill of mashbill of 64% corn, 24% wheat and 12% malted barley. It is quite hard to find but you can try searching online for it and TotalWine has it listed on their website but that’s regional so I hope you get lucky!\nShop Wilderness Trail Here\nHakata Whisky 12-Year-Old Sherry Cask\nNew to the United States this year but well established in Japan, Hakata Whisky was a revelation for me. I was able to sample their various age statements as they entered the US market and fell in love with the 12-year-old Sherry Cask Hakata Whisky.\nThis is a very balanced Japanese whisky that isn’t over-sherried and it carries aromas full of dates, barrel spice, and orange peel. If you are looking to branch out like I was, 100% check this expression out from Hakata.\nShop Hakata Whisky Here\nLimited-Edition Knob Creek 18-Year-Old Bourbon\nOnce again, Knob Creek blessed us all with a limited-edition release of Knob Creek 18-year-old bourbon. I’ve got a bottle of this on my shelf that’s about to disappear because it’s one of my absolute favorites year over year.\nHere is the rundown on\nwhat’s inside the bottle:\n- Proof: 100\n- Color: Rich copper tones with auburn hues\n- Aroma: Brown sugar and aged oak, with notes of char and caramel\n- Taste: Full-bodied with notes of caramelized oak and hints of sweet vanilla and baking spices\n- Finish: Warm finished with spice and slight floral and fruit notes\nShop Knob Creek Here\nWild Turkey Master’s Keep: Voyage\nThe folks at Wild Turkey have been pumping out some incredibly solid liquid for close to a century, but head distiller Eddie Russell has really taken things to the next level with the “Master’s Keep” line that made its debut in 2015.\nThis year, the distillery linked up with Appleton Estate to secure some casks that had spent 14 years aging Jamaican rum to create what was dubbed “Voyage.”\nThose barrels were used to finish 10-year-old bourbon that inherited the tropical notes you’d expect on the nose, and the final product (bottled at 106 proof) is a spicy sipper where caramel is supported by a backbone of chocolate and oak.\nBlue Spot 7-Year-Old Irish Whiskey\nBlue Spot was initially released in 2021, and based on how much I’ve enjoyed the other offering in the line, I spent a couple of years looking forward to trying it before finally getting the chance to check it off my list during a trip to Dead Rabbit in New York City.\nI got to taste it alongside Red Spot and Yellow Spot, and while neither of those offerings let me down, Blue Spot was easily the standout.\nWhile the 7-year-old Irish whiskey is relatively young compared to some of the others on this list, it’s an incredibly full-bodied cask-strength dram defined by vanilla and baking spices that mesh perfectly with the sweetness instilled by the sherry butts and Madeira casks used to take it to the next level.\nShop Blue Spot Here\nStarward Ginger Beer Cask #7\nMore and more distilleries are branching out when it comes to the type of barrels they harness to impart different flavors during the finishing process, but I’m not sure if I’ve had a single whiskey this year that surprised my taste buds quite like Starward Ginger Cask #7.\nThe Australian producer embraces red wine barrels for the production of Solera, and it decided to use the casks that were home to the ginger beer it produces to finish a limited batch of its whiskey.\nThe end result is almost like drinking boozy butterscotch; the ginger is obviously present without being overpowering, and dried fruits and pineapple round out one of the more unique whiskeys I’ve gotten to try in the past couple of years.",

    "title": "Muslim Woman Faces Harassment for Wearing Saffron Stole: A Tale of Religious Intolerance | NewsTrack English 1",
    "text": "Lucknow: A Muslim woman in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, faced harassment and humiliation from her family, religious leader, and co-religionists for wearing a saffron stole over her niqab. She visited the police commissioner's office with a saffron dupatta covering her headscarf, recounting her ordeal in front of the media. She stated, \"I had gone to meet the Chief Minister with concerns about harassment and property conflict. However, many people told me that I am now a Hindu and hence, as per Sharia, I am not eligible for any assistance going forward.\" The victim, from the Moolganj area, informed the chief minister about her predicament on December 23 while wearing the saffron dupatta. She revealed that her brothers wanted to evict her from the house due to a property dispute. Moreover, people in her neighborhood harassed her when she went out. She reported it to the authorities in 2022. She then visited CM Yogi, after which the police intervened. The photograph of the encounter went viral, creating problems for her. Her brothers stopped feeding her, took all her belongings, including sweaters and blankets, and left her to fend for herself in the winter with just her dupatta. She disclosed that she was mocked for wearing the stole and taunted that she had become like Yogi Adityanath. Her brothers instructed her to go to him because she is Hindu now. They threw her out of the house after assaulting her, and she is currently living with her mother. Additionally, everything their father left behind, including the property, cash, and jewelry, was transferred into their names by her brothers. The city cleric Abdul Quddus Haji initially promised to help her. However, when she visited him on November 29, 2023, he claimed that she had converted to Hinduism after meeting with the chief minister in saffron. He ordered her to leave the place, hurling abuses at her and shooing her away when she pleaded for help to survive. Furthermore, the meager assistance from her brothers was also discontinued. She was supposed to receive Rs 3000 and Rs 2000 from her two brothers, respectively, along with the fulfillment of her basic requirements like food and clothes. Following the incident, she complained to Jamiat Ulema e Hind’s national president Arshad Madani and protested about the same, but he brushed her off, alleging that the city clergy would take care of this since it was a local problem. She also presented the audio of the conversation to the media. The woman submitted a report to the police commissioner’s staff officer Ashok Kumar Singh, who informed that the task of conducting the probe had been entrusted to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (ADCP) Anita Singh. He proclaimed, \"The woman and her brothers are already at odds. She has complained about it many times. The police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) and taken action.\" Meanwhile, the cleric has alleged that the accusations against him are false. \"How can I even think of such a thing to stop her from going to meet the chief minister,\" he asked.

    "text": "By : Lillie-Beth Brinkman//The Journal Record//December 26, 2024//\nBy : Lillie-Beth Brinkman//The Journal Record//December 26, 2024//\nWe’ve wrapped up a midweek Christmas Day and are looking ahead!\nI hope everyone had a merry one. I’m writing this column in one of my favorite holiday spots – the Great Hall of the beautiful and Oklahoma-historic First National Center in Oklahoma City. It’s a beautiful building on a regular day and even more spectacular decked out for the holidays – if you get a chance, stop by for some photos and marvel that this marble-covered lobby is in Oklahoma City.\nSince the two-story Christmas tree in the First National will put anyone in a festive mood, let’s talk about events coming up and those still here for the holidays that I know about so far.\n– First, Oklahoma Ranch is presenting the Oklahoma Opry’s “New Year’s Eve Eve” concert and fundraiser on Monday in Oklahoma City’s Bricktown at 425 Kings of Leon Lane with a variety of performers.\nThe VIP cocktail reception is at 6 p.m. for ages 21 and older, followed by the 7:30 p.m. show for all ages.\nPerformers include America’s Got Talent winner Darci Lynne and Friends, as well as Zach Ray, OK3, Owen Pickard, Kyle Earhart, Amanda Earhart, Tanner Massey, Maddox Ross, Cutter Elliott, Tammy Brasier, Jarrid Matlock, Cindy Scarberry, Haylie Bagwell and Dustin Jones.\nProceeds benefit the Opry Heritage Foundation of Oklahoma and its nonprofit programs, which include the Oklahoma Opry, Guitars for Vets: Oklahoma City Chapter, and the Granville Community Music School, show information states.\nThe evening includes a silent auction.

They’re performing selections for their Yacht Rock Spectacular and Neon Mix Tape shows at 8 p.m. Every time I have heard this band perform live, I have had the best time watching this ensemble local group.
