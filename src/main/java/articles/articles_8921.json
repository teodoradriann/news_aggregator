Shelly Saransin and Eva Welch are the directors of the outreach organization.\n\"Nine years later, we now have two outreach buses and we travel Milwaukee County three nights a week to serve those who are unsheltered,\" said Saransin.\nSIGN UP TODAY: Get daily headlines, breaking news emails from FOX6 News\nOn weeks like this, when sub-zero temperatures hit, they are out every day, offering to take people to shelters and warming centers.\n\"We’re trying to convince our friends who have severe mental illness, it’s too dangerous to be outside,\" Saransin said. \"I feel like if we haven’t been out here checking on people they wouldn’t have made it through tonight.\"\nDespite their heroic efforts, it’s impossible to reach everyone. The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office reported three probable hypothermia deaths from the weekend – all involving homeless individuals.\n\"We were riding around saying, ‘if we only knew them, maybe we could have got them connected to warming,’ and maybe they’d still be here with us,\" Welch said.\nUntil there’s a permanent solution, these two, along with volunteers and donors, are free winter essentials, from clothes to hot meals, even providing hotel rooms for their most vulnerable.\n\"I wish we could do it for everybody, but we can’t so that’s why we are out here now making sure we are able to get people into places that are open,\" Welch said.\nMaking sure to be present, turning Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day into more than just a day off, but a way of life.\nFREE DOWNLOAD: Get breaking news alerts in the FOX6 News app for iOS or Android.\n\"For us, it doesn’t matter if it’s a holiday or not and for the folks on the street, I think it matters more because that we’re willing to come out on the holidays and we’re willing to be there when everything else is closed,\" Welch said.\nThe Street Angels say right now, they are in need of men’s thermals and sweats.\nWarming shelters available Health officials are reminding people in need of a public space to stay warm overnight to visit one of the following warming shelters in Milwaukee :\nGuest House Milwaukee (men only)1216 N 13th StreetWalk-ins only, 7-10 p.m. intake, can stay from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. MRM/Joy House/Door of Hope (men, women, families)819 N 18th StreetCall ahead for shelter space: (414) 344-2211 St. Ben’s (men and women)930 W.

    "text": "THE NEW YORK TIMES How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke\nA pall of smoke from wildfires hangs over downtown Portland, Ore., on Sept. 11, 2020. Scientists are still studying the long-term health effects of smoke exposure. [Amanda Lucier/The New York Times] Dani Blum July 5, 2024 05.07.2024 • 03:36\nExtreme wildfires are becoming more common, more intense and more of a pressing problem for public health. This week, more than 20,000 people in Northern California evacuated their homes as flames destroyed houses and cars.\nWildfire smoke presents its own challenge. There is most likely no safe level of exposure to wildfire smoke, said Jennifer Stowell, a climate and health research scientist at the Boston University School of Public Health. But there are precautions you can take to minimize its toll on your health.\nWhat to look for Don’t rely on only your eyes to determine when the air quality is poor, said Dr Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Get in the habit of checking air quality indexes every day, especially in the summer, when wildfires are more common. You can look at AirNow.Gov for a measure of your local air quality; Fire.airnow.gov also has a helpful map of fire and smoke patterns and how they are influencing air quality.\nIt’s also important to know your personal risk. Wildfire smoke can exacerbate respiratory conditions: People with asthma may be prone to more attacks, and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can experience more difficulty breathing.\nIt can sometimes take a week or so for those symptoms to appear after you breathe in wildfire smoke, Stowell said.\nInhaling smoke can also trigger inflammation in the body, which may put people with underlying chronic conditions like diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart disease at increased risk of getting sick.\nBabies and young children, whose lungs are still developing and who inhale a greater proportion of air compared to their body size, are more sensitive to air pollution. Older adults are also more vulnerable, because they can have weakened immune systems. While researchers are still exploring the effects of inhaling wildfire smoke during pregnancy, early evidence suggests that exposure may be harmful to a developing fetus and may raise the risk of preterm birth.\nEven if you do not have underlying medical conditions, it can still be dangerous to breathe in smoke. Scientists are still trying to understand the long-term effects of smoke exposure. The toll is probably cumulative: the more smoke you’re exposed to, the greater the risk of health issues down the line, Galiatsatos said. In the short term, exposure to smoke can lead to eye or sinus irritation, shortness of breath, wheezing, headaches or coughing.\nIf you go outside If the air quality is poor, or if it is moderate but you are at high risk, try to limit the amount of time you spend outside as much as possible.\nWhen you do go outside, wear a high-quality, tightfitting mask, like an N95. A surgical mask is not sufficient to filter out the tiny, damaging particulates in wildfire smoke, Stowell said. And change clothes when you get home, Galiatsatos suggested, to avoid bringing in any smoke particles that could contaminate the air inside your house.\nStaying indoors Make sure all the windows in your home are sealed tightly shut. Do not burn candles or smoke indoors, which creates more indoor air pollution, said Laura Corlin, an associate professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.\nAir purifiers can help filter particles out of the air inside your home. People with respiratory conditions like asthma might benefit from an additional HEPA filter with the purifier, which can remove more particles from the air.\n“Know who you are, and what your lungs need,” Galiatsatos said.\nIf you don’t have an air purifier, an air-conditioner can also help, with a few caveats. If you have a window air-conditioning unit, make sure the seal to the window is as tight as possible. If you have central air system that takes in air from outside, close the outside air damper, or switch the system to recirculate mode, Corlin suggested, so that it does not pull polluted air into your home.\nIf you’re able, upgrade to a higher quality filter, like a MERV 13, which captures more particles.\nIf you do not have air-conditioning, you can use a fan to circulate air, and turn it on at the highest setting – something is better than nothing, Corlin said. Your local health department may also run cooling centers. These air-conditioned public spaces can offer relief from the heat and protection against smoke, Stowell said. Even an air-conditioned space like a shopping mall may offer better air quality than a home without air-conditioning.",

    "text": "- Liberty Energy (\nLBRT,Financial) reported Q1 2025 revenue of $977 million, a 4% sequential increase. - Net income for the quarter was $20 million, translating to $0.12 EPS.\n- Adjusted EBITDA rose 8% sequentially to $168 million.\nLiberty Energy Inc. (LBRT) has announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2025, showcasing a revenue increase to $977 million, up 4% from the previous quarter but down from $1.1 billion in Q1 2024. Despite market challenges, the company's Adjusted EBITDA also rose by 8% sequentially to $168 million.\nThe company's net income for Q1 2025 was $20 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share, showing a decline from $82 million in Q1 2024. This shift is attributed to margin pressures even as overall revenue and operational metrics showed sequential growth.\nLiberty Energy displayed strategic movements in its operations by acquiring IMG Energy Solutions to expand its footprint into distributed power systems. The company also successfully tested the industry's first natural gas variable speed pump with digiPrime technology, enhancing its technological edge.\nThe company returned $37 million to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, retiring 1.0% of shares during Q1 2025. Since the repurchase program's reinstatement in July 2022, Liberty has cumulatively retired 15.9% of its outstanding shares, emphasizing its commitment to shareholder value.\nAs of March 31, 2025, Liberty Energy reported a strong balance sheet with $24 million in cash and $164 million in total liquidity, providing a buffer against market volatility. The management anticipates sequential growth in revenue and profitability for Q2 2025, bolstered by higher fleet utilization and robust demand for services despite tariff pressures and OPEC+ strategies.\nLiberty Energy continues to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, reflecting its stable capital return strategy. The company also remains proactive in mitigating tariff-related impacts and strengthening its position through technological advancements and market diversification.",
