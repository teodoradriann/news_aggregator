    "text": "ChatGPT desktop app is now on Windows. You don’t have to buy a Mac for that.\nIt was only a matter of time before OpenAI pushed its digital tentacles into the heart of your PC. Today, the AI behemoth launched a Windows desktop app for ChatGPT, ready to swoop in and streamline your productivity, or perhaps, redefine it entirely.\nHow to use ChatGPT on Windows Here’s how to get it up and running on your Windows machine:\nGo to openai.com/chatgpt/download\nFirst, head over to OpenAI’s official download page to grab the ChatGPT Windows app. Download it from the Microsoft Store\nYou’ll be redirected to the Microsoft Store. Hit that download button like you mean it. Install it like any other app\nIt’s a smooth process—just follow the usual prompts and let it install. Sign in with your OpenAI account\nOnce it’s ready, open the app and log in using your OpenAI credentials. Simple as that. Hit Alt + Space to wake it up\nNow, here’s the fun part. Whenever you need ChatGPT, just tap Alt + Space on your keyboard and it’ll pop up, ready to assist. No need to leave your current task—it’s always at your fingertips. Sure, the new ChatGPT Windows app lets you hit Alt + Space and summon the AI straight from your desktop. It’s sleek, accessible, and promises to shave off precious seconds from your workflow by skipping the browser. But let’s not be naive—this isn’t just about convenience. OpenAI is making its play for dominance. By embedding itself into the core of your operating system, it’s positioning ChatGPT not merely as a chatbot but as an essential cog in the machinery of modern knowledge work.\nWhy? The answer lies in user engagement. By slipping into your workflow, ChatGPT becomes less of a tool you use when you think of it and more of a tool you can’t do without.\nWith this Windows release, it’s clear that ChatGPT is gunning for a spot in your office suite, and frankly, it’s poised to give Microsoft Office and even its own partner, Microsoft’s Copilot, a run for their money.\nThe new ChatGPT Windows app lets you hit Alt + Space and summon the AI straight from your desktop ( Image credit ) The timing? Spot-on. ChatGPT’s venture into Windows coincides with whispers of OpenAI seeking collaborations outside its usual Microsoft safe haven. Oracle’s data centers and the Pentagon’s interests in AI only add to the growing momentum. And if OpenAI pulls it off, we could be looking at a future where the likes of Excel and Word become quaint relics of a pre-AI world.\nNow, before you get too excited, let’s address the elephant in the room. This Windows app isn’t a finished product . Voice Mode —the feature that makes ChatGPT feel less like a chatbot and more like your personal assistant—is notably absent in this early release. Sure, you can still upload files, photos, and sync conversations, but some integrations, including connections with OpenAI’s GPT Store , remain spotty. Once the kinks are ironed out and Voice Mode arrives, we’re talking about a tool that might just outclass other desktop AIs.\nIn the end, the question isn’t whether ChatGPT can become the cornerstone of your PC. The question is: can you imagine your workday without it?",

    "text": "The idea came from the bride's mother who “coordinated, choreographed and recorded” the dance to send to family members so they could practice\nBy Kimberlee Speakman Kimberlee Speakman Kimberlee Speakman is a digital writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has previously appeared in Forbes and she has also worked in broadcast television as a reporter for Hawaii-based news station KHON2 News. People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 19, 2024 03:53PM EDT Comments One bride got the surprise of her life on her big day!\nIn a new viral video, shared by Storyful, bride Katherine Martineau can be seen at her wedding in Montreal, Canada, where her family members and friends broke out in a choreographed dance to ABBA' s hit song “Dancing Queen.”\nIn the video, the bride could be seen on the balcony of the St. James Theatre in Montreal getting ready to toss her bouquet into the crowd of guests who gathered below before the song suddenly came on and the crowd broke out into a dance filled with several iconic moves — similar to the ones featured in the Mamma Mia! movie.\nDozens of the wedding guests could be seen moving in sync with practiced moves as they pointed up to the bride, waved their hands in the air from side to side, clapped and moved about the dance floor with big smiles on their faces.\nBride Surprises Her Parents with Emotional First Dance at Her Wedding 25 Years After They Eloped The bride “was the only person” at the reception “who had no idea” that her guests had planned to do this, Melissa Bizdikian, who captured the video, told Storyful.\n“In her mind, the plan was to do a bouquet toss over the balcony but a flash mob broke out!,” Bizdikian said.\nThe idea for the dance came from her mother, who “coordinated, choreographed and recorded” the dance to send to family members so they could practice ahead of time, according to Good Morning America , which reshared the video.\nBride’s Mother Surprises Her at Wedding by Performing ABBA Song in Costume — Watch! Martineau could be seen in the video turning to her groom, Jim Haesaerts, who was standing next to her in shock before breaking out into a wide smile, seemingly overjoyed by the display.\nThe pair shared a sweet moment as they embraced and the groom kissed his new bride on the forehead before they turned back to watch their guests perform from the balcony. As the dance went on, the bride could be seen swaying along to the music as the groom clapped in time with the song.\nABBA songs appear to be a popular choice for weddings, as another bride in California was surprised by a performance from her mother and some friends who danced to ABBA’s classic “Super Trooper” on stage last year.\nFor that performance, the bride's mother danced and lip-synced the words to the song and incorporated the same moves from the film including pointing up and to the side, and wiggling her hands — all while in similar flare pants from the film.\nComments All comments are subject to our Community Guidelines .

    "text": "For close to six years now, this 27-year-old woman has been with her 26-year-old fiancé, and six months ago, she gave birth to their first child together, a little boy. While she was still pregnant, she began to take note of her fiancé pulling back from her, not only in a physical sense but in an emotional one as well. A week before she gave birth to their son, she celebrated her birthday. Disappointingly, her fiancé purchased her a $25 Starbucks gift card as her only present. “For Mother’s Day, he handed me a dead bouquet of flowers he left in the garage overnight without water and a card that should have been made out to his own mother – not the mother of his child,” she explained. Around a year ago, they stopped being physically close, and although she’s tried to speak to her fiancé about changing that and exiting their roommates only phase, he won’t engage with her. Every night, he sits there in bed next to her, watching TikTok videos while she gets their son ready for bed alone. From there, they just go to sleep. Yesterday evening, she pressed her fiancé further on the issue, and he was hesitant to tell her the truth. “After he skirted around some excuses, he finally tells me, “I think you love me more than I love you,” she said. “He explained that there are “levels” to love & that maybe we just are on different levels. I asked, “Has it always been that way?” To which he replies, “I guess I just love you less now. To say I’m shattered is kind of an understatement. If we’re being honest, I saw it coming. I could feel it.” [Sign up for Chip Chick’s newsletter and get stories like this delivered to your inbox.](https://forms.feedblitz.com/85e)",

    "title": "I lavoratori di Boeing vanno allo scontro con l'azienda. 30mila in sciopero, chiedono aumenti del 25% - Il Fatto Quotidiano",
    "text": "Per la prima volta dal 2008 gli operai della statunitense Boeing sono entrati in sciopero. Scelta quasi plebiscitaria, il 94,5% dei dipendenti interpellati dai sindacati ha votato a favore della mobilitazione dopo che l’azienda ha respinto la richiesta di un aumento salariale del 25% in quattro anni . A fermarsi dalla mezzanotte sono i 30mila addetti delle linee di produzione dei 737 Max e 777 nelle aree di Portland e Seattle.\nLa richiesta di aumento è considerata eccessiva dall’azienda, che sta facendo fronte a enormi perdite finanziarie anche in seguito a una serie di incidenti – compresi due disastri aerei – che hanno riguardato principalmente i modelli 737 Max . Inizia così in salita la sfida per il risanamento della nuova amministratrice delegata Kelly Ortberg , nominata il mese scorso. “Noi restiamo impegnati nel ristabilire un rapporto con i nostri dipendenti e con il sindacato e siamo pronti a tornare al tavolo negoziale per un nuovo accordo”, dice la dirigenza del colosso aeronautico in una nota. I lavoratori sostengono però che gli aumenti salariali proposti sono troppo esigui dopo un decennio di stagnazione degli stipendi e l’aumento del costo della vita.\nLeggi Anche Stellantis, il primo sciopero di Fca Security: “Una vera dismissione pur di ridurre i costi” Un dipendente, riporta il Wall Street Journal , ha rimarcato come la paga iniziale proposta dal nuovo contratto, 21 $ l’ora , sia simile a quella di una catena di hamburger locale, Dick’s Drive- In, che offre anche un’assicurazione sanitaria gratuita per i dipendenti e un contributo 401(k). “Si possono guadagnare di più cucinando hamburger”, ha detto.\nNel corso del 2023 i sindacati di altri settori come l’industria automobilistica e o gli sceneggiatori e gli attori di Hollywood sono riusciti a ottenere grandi vittori e importanti aumenti degli stipendi. L’anno scorso, negli Usa, hanno scioperato complessivamente 540mila lavoratori, il doppio dell’anno prima . Quando i dipendenti di Boeing scesero in sciopero nel 2008 provocarono al gruppo perdite stimate in 100 milioni di dollari al giorno.\nBoeing Articolo Precedente Lo stress da lavoro uccide anche la tecnologia: altro che lontano ricordo Articolo Successivo Intelligenza artificiale, opportunità o rischio?

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "El mal uso de la tecnología intensifica problemas emocionales en los jóvenes",
    "text": "“Cuanto mayor es la percepción por parte de los adolescentes de uso incorrecto de la tecnología, mayor es el índice auto percibido de los trastornos emocionales”. A esta conclusión llega el I Estudio sobre la percepción de la salud mental en adolescentes y el mal uso de la tecnología, elaborado por DKV, la aseguradora Activista de la Salud, y Educar es Todo, la mayor comunidad de padres, madres y expertos en crianza respetuosa. Así, con una nuestra de 1,475 adolescentes de entre 10 y 17 años, una segunda muestra de 1,630 madres/padres y, una tercera de 105 docentes, el estudio analizó la relación existente entre el empleo problemático de la tecnología y los trastornos de estados de ánimo en población adolescente. A través de un cuestionario, que incluía preguntas sobre hábitos de vida -alimentación y sueño-, y calidad de las relaciones familiares, se estimó que “más de la mitad de los adolescentes han usado internet para sentirse mejor cuando han estado solos, tristes o enfadados”. En cuanto a cómo interfieren las tecnologías en los hábitos cotidianos de los adolescentes, el 35% de ellos aseguró comer o cenar viendo la televisión, tableta o móvil. De hecho, 1 de cada 2 afirmó tener el móvil en su habitación por las noches. En este sentido, los progenitores explicaron que aquellos adolescentes que hacen un mal uso de la tecnología, duermen menos horas de lo recomendado entresemana y que “el 89,5% de adolescentes consideran que tienen dificultades para controlar el tiempo de uso”. En lo que se refiere a sus relaciones sociales, 7 de cada 10 adolescentes aseguran estar con el móvil la mayor parte del tiempo cuando están con amigos. Fernando Campos, consejero de DKV Seguros afirmó que “en DKV, como activistas de la salud, entendemos que el bienestar mental de los jóvenes\\\". Según el ‘I Estudio sobre la percepción de la salud mental en adolescentes y el mal uso de la tecnología’, más de la mitad de los encuestados han usado internet para sentirse mejor cuando han estado solos, tristes o enfadados es uno de los retos más urgentes de nuestra sociedad. Con este nuevo estudio no solo hemos conseguido una visión más profunda sobre el estado de la salud mental de la juventud, sino que también refuerza nuestro compromiso de seguir impulsando iniciativas que fomenten su bienestar y así poder construir un futuro más saludable para las próximas generaciones”. Por su parte, Carmen Llopis, directora de Educar es Todo, expuso “el firme compromiso de su comunidad con la identificación de los factores que afectan negativamente a la salud mental de nuestros adolescentes con el fin de poder erradicarlos. Así, como su deseo de seguir sensibilizando sobre este tema, ya que los datos al respecto son cada vez más preocupantes”. La Dra. Silvia Ávala y el Dr. Rafa Guerrero, ambos psicólogos educativos, resaltaron las señales que pueden alertar sobre una posible adicción a las pantallas. “Este estudio confirma lo que vemos los psicólogos en la parte clínica: los adolescentes que tienen una adicción tecnológica se muestran más inatentos, hiperactivos e infelices, además de menos empáticos”, explicó Guerrero. Los cuestionarios realizados por padres y madres establecieron que, cuanto mayor es la percepción de los padres sobre uso incorrecto que hacen sus hijos de la tecnología, mayor es el índice de percepción de problemas de conducta: más síntomas emocionales (preocupación, somatizaciones, infelicidad, nerviosismo); más problemas con compañeros (soledad), mayor hiperactividad y menor es el índice prosocial. Asimismo, en los cuestionarios realizados por docentes se estima que, cuanto mayor es la percepción de los docentes sobre la utilización incorrecta que hacen sus alumnos de la tecnología, mayor es la percepción de síntomas emocionales y mayor es el índice de percepción de problemas de conducta. Entre ellos: preocupación, somatizaciones, infelicidad, nerviosismo, distracción con facilidad, inquietud.. Los padres necesitan, no solo saber identificar si sus hijos tienen un problema de adicción a las pantallas, también precisan pautas para poder prevenir la situación. Y es que, tal y como enfatizó el estudio, los padres son modelos de sus hijos y deben ser conscientes de esto. Para ello, ambos psicólogos ofrecen diez recomendaciones para un uso saludable de las pantallas. Una de las más importantes es asegurarse que, antes de los 3 años, 0 pantallas: “tanto el cerebro del niño como el ojo son especialmente sensibles y necesitan madurar fuera de las pantallas”. Otra de las recomendaciones destaca la importancia del acompañamiento: “de 3 a 5 años, cómo mucho podrían utilizar 30 minutos al día para ver algún dibujo, siempre acorde a su edad, pero siempre acompañados. La pantalla no es un canguro ni un aparca niños”, explicó Álava. Asimismo, a la hora de su primer dispositivo “es recomendable establecer un contrato, dejando claro que, mientras sean menores, tendremos acceso al mismo”, concluyó Guerrero.

This will significantly improve the EAF by the end of March 2025,” the power utility said.\nEskom thanked government and the National Energy Crisis Committee (NECOM), and other stakeholders for their collaborative efforts, which have enabled the successful execution of its plans.\n “We will persist in implementing the operational recovery plan, strengthening governance, and future-proofing the organisation to ensure energy security, growth, and long-term sustainability for the benefit of South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.\n“We remain committed to improving the current business while laying the groundwork for future opportunities and initiatives. We will continue to seize every opportunity presented by industry changes for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n“The pace of change is rapid, and we are prepared to deliver on the future through improved implementation and disciplined execution,” Eskom concluded.\nHere’s to many more load shedding-free days!",

    "title": "Gaston Glock 1929-2023 | Washington Examiner",
    "text": "Gaston Glock , the inventor of the famous semi-automatic pistol that bore his name , died on Dec. 27. He was 94 years old.\nThe Glock is almost synonymous with firearms . The Glock pistol and its variations enjoy a love/hate relationship with gun enthusiasts. It appears in pop culture, such as the ceramic Glock 7 in (not true — no such gun) and U.S. Marshal Deputy Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) in extolling the ability of the pistol to shoot underwater or after getting buried in sand (true). Hip-hop artists such as Snoop Dogg inserted the pistol name into song lyrics. It is the most widely used pistol in police departments in the United States and is the pistol of choice for security forces in nearly 50 nations.\nMATTHEW PERRY, 1969-2023\nGlock wasn’t in the firearms business until he overheard a conversation between Austrian army officers about a new military contract for a pistol. After speaking with the officers and handgun experts, he used his engineering background to design and patented the pistol, using a lightweight polymer (not plastic) frame and the striker-fire mechanism as opposed to a hammer-fire. Though that was designed by John Browning, the maker of the .45 caliber 1911, Glock’s use of it in his new pistol would mark a significant change in the manufacture of pistols. The result was a plain-looking pistol, one that did not have the aesthetic of the Italian-made Beretta 92s the company released in 1976. However, the Glock was inexpensive to produce, reliable, and accurate. In 1982, the Austrian army ordered 20,000 of the Glock 17, which was so-named after the number patent filed by Glock during its development.\nGlock was born in Vienna on July 19, 1929. When he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht as a teenager toward the end of World War II, it was the only time he handled a firearm until he developed his own. He graduated from a technical institute, training in engineering. He took a job at a company that made hand drills.\nHe married his first wife, Helga, in 1962. They had three children together: Robert, Gaston Jr., and Brigitte. The family lived in the Deutsch-Wagram suburb of Vienna, where Glock was the manager of a car radiator factory. They started a small side business, making curtain rods and brass fittings before expanding the business and getting contracts to make knives and bayonets for the Austrian army. It was during a visit to the Defense Ministry that Glock heard about the contract for a new pistol.\nThe firearms quickly gained popularity and, by the 1990s, were a $100 million per year business. In 1999, Glock’s financial adviser, Charles Ewert, tried to have him assassinated. During a business meeting in Luxembourg, a masked man with a rubber mallet attacked Glock in a garage. Ewert ran off, and Glock fought off his attacker. Ewert returned with the police, but they later implicated him in the plot after learning he was embezzling money from the company. The attacker and Ewert were convicted of attempted murder.\nOutside the attempt on his life, Glock lived a mostly reclusive life at his estate in Vienna. He and Helga divorced in 2011, and at 82, Glock married his second wife, 31-year-old Kathrin Tschikof, who was his nurse following a stroke in 2008. The Glock divorce was messy as Helga sued in Austria, claiming alimony for their nearly 50-year marriage. She also said he deprived her of a 15% stake in the company. She prevailed in the alimony case but did not win in her attempt at a stake in the company. Helga later filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court, claiming she was cheated out of money, but that suit was subsequently dismissed.\nThe company continued to grow, and today, according to the Glock website, the company manufactures “50 pistols in a variety of sizes, calibers, and styles.” Over 20 million Glocks have been made, and the company sells about 1 million in the U.S. every year. Sixty-five percent of police departments in the U.S. use some variation of a Glock pistol, and in 2019, the U.S. Secret Service switched to 9 mm Glock pistols after using Sig Sauer .357-caliber duty weapons for over 20 years.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nLatest Ferrari: More terrible than joyful By: Jack Baruth The cultural story of denazification By: Anthony Paletta Stick a spork in 2023 By: Rob Long Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

    "text": "En diffusion depuis le 26 janvier sur Apple TV+, [Masters of the Air](/series/ficheserie_gen_cserie=11807.html) est [la série spectaculaire de l'année, que vous ne regardez peut-être pas encore](/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=1000067281.html). Produite par [Steven Spielberg](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=471.html), [Tom Hanks](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=14100.html) et [Gary Goetzman](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=40921.html), cette fiction de guerre s'inscrit dans la lignée de deux précédents succès : [Band of Brothers](/series/ficheserie_gen_cserie=306.html) et [The Pacific](/series/ficheserie_gen_cserie=4321.html). Le trio de producteurs et le scénariste [John Orloff](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=92900.html) racontent l'incroyable histoire des hommes du 100ème Groupe de bombardements (surnommés les \"Bloody Hundredth\" en raison de leurs pertes conséquentes) de la 8ème Air Force américaine, chargée de bombarder l'Allemagne nazie et ses lieux industriels et d'armements stratégiques pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. La série Masters of the Air raconte l'histoire de vrais héros Masters of the Air est en grande partie inspirée du livre éponyme de [Donald L. Miller](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=624681.html) mais elle s'appuie également sur d'autres ressources majeures provenant de musées d'histoires, dont le Smithsonian, des experts historiques mais aussi les mémoires de certains anciens héros de guerre et les témoignages de leurs familles. Parmi les véritables héros de guerre qui apparaissent dans la série, on retrouve les majors John Egan ( [Callum Turner](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=673723.html)), Gale Cleven ( [Austin Butler](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=214046.html)), Harry Crosby ( [Anthony Boyle](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=777899.html)), Robert Rosenthal ( [Nate Mann](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=895564.html)) ou encore le sergent Ken Lemmons ( [Raff Law](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=455776.html)). Comme le rappelle Austin Butler, cette série sert également le devoir de mémoire de cette période sombre de l'Histoire et de ces héros : \"C’est une partie de l’histoire de la Seconde Guerre mondiale que je ne connaissais pas bien, notamment les statistiques. Le fait que 77% du 100ème groupe de bombardements ne soient jamais revenus, mais aussi la bravoure dont ils ont fait preuve à remonter dans ces avions jour après jour, c’est juste incroyable. Et le monde ne serait pas le même sans le sacrifice qu’ils ont fait.\" Le 100ème Groupe de bombardements a effectué près de 300 missions de juin 1943 à avril 1945. On dénombre une perte de plus de 700 pilotes et de plus de 170 avions au cours de leurs périlleuses missions, qui ont conduit certains d'entre eux à être des prisonniers de guerre, jusqu'à la libération et la fin de la guerre. Les autres héros de guerre : les Tuskegee Airmen Il n'y a pas que les pilotes du 100ème Groupe de bombardements de la 8ème Air Force américaine qui sont mis à l'honneur dans Masters of the Air. Un autre groupe de pilotes majeurs, pourtant moins mis en lumière dans l'Histoire, a été mis sur le devant de la scène. Il était impossible pour Gary Goetzman de ne pas intégrer les Tuskegee Airmen, un groupe d'aviateurs afro-américains qui s'est distingué durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, dans le récit de Masters of the Air : \"Quand nous avons découvert qu'ils avaient été à proximité de nos gars du Stalag Luft III (camp de prisonniers de guerre durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale où étaient incarcérés des personnels des forces aériennes alliées, ndlr), c'était tout simplement incroyable de penser que nous pouvions les ajouter à notre histoire. Et donc nous avons fait ce choix et c’était incroyable.\" Parmi les Tuskegee Airmen mis à l'honneur dans la série on retrouve notamment les Seconds Lieutenants Richard D. Macon ( [Josiah Cross](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=925147.html)), Alexander Jefferson ( [Branden Cook](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=899556.html)) et Robert Daniels ( [Ncuti Gatwa](/personne/fichepersonne_gen_cpersonne=861206.html)). Près de 1000 pilotes Ce nom donné aux aviateurs afro-américains vient du fait qu'ils ont été formés à la base de Moton Field à Tuskegee et au Tuskegee Institute dans l'Alabama, sous la direction de l'US Army Air Corps. Entre 1941 et 1946, près de 1000 pilotes de chasse et pilotes de bombardiers de l'unité du 99e Escadron de chasse ont combattu en Afrique du Nord, en mer Méditerranée et en Europe au péril de leur vie. C'est grâce à l'appui de plusieurs institutions, leaders syndicaux, associations, dont la National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) et l'agence gouvernementale la National Youth Administration, et des personnalités publiques comme Bayard Rustin, que le gouvernement a accepté l'intégration d'Afro-Américains au sein de l'Air Corps. \"Une infériorité intellectuelle supposée\" Malgré cette ouverture, du fait du président de l'époque Franklin D. Roosevelt, la base de Tuskegee subit la ségrégation et les discours racistes de pseudo-scientifiques affirmant que les Afro-Américains étaient incapables de superviser et mener des vols de combats complexes, du fait \"d'une infériorité intellectuelle supposée\". Les Tuskegee Airmen ont prouvé à maintes reprises leurs compétences dans les airs et leur courage héroïque tout au long de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. En septembre 1941, le magazine Time leur a même consacré un article en mettant en lumière l'innovation que représente la formation de pilotes afro-américains. Comme le 100ème Groupe de bombardements de la 8ème Air Force américaine, les Tuksegee Airmen ont mené de nombreuses missions (près de 1500), ont subi d'immenses pertes et ont aussi été faits prisonniers de guerre. C'est dans le huitième épisode que la série Masters of the Air les introduits et les rassemblent avec le 100ème Groupe de bombardements. Propos recueillis par Mégane Choquet le 22 janvier 2024 à Londres. Le neuvième et dernier épisode de Masters of the Air sera disponible le 15 mars sur Apple TV+, via la plateforme et via myCANAL.
