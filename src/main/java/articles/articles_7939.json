    "text": "Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called on Egypt on Wednesday to prevent activists from reaching Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip and entering the Palestinian territory. This would endanger the safety of Israeli troops in Gaza, which would not be allowed, Katz said in a statement. The Israeli army currently controls the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing. Earlier Egyptian authorities called on activists to obtain official permits on their journey from Tunisia to the border with Gaza in solidarity with Palestinian civilians. Some 1,700 activists have set off from Tunis in buses and cars, according to the state news agency TAP, including around 200 from Algeria. They hope to travel through Libya and Egypt to reach the Rafah crossing with Gaza to protest Israel's conduct in the war. Among them were 52 French, 67 Algerian, 13 Moroccan and 8 Libyan nationals.",

    "text": "The resurrection of Christ is the corner stone of Christian mystical thought. As such, there are no neutral or idle thoughts for the spiritual seeker. In this way, all thought produces form at some level but they are either true or false. For the spiritual aspirant, the resurrection, correctly speaking, is the highest level of thought; for it acknowledges that there is no thought but God.\nChrist’s thinking differs from mortal man’s insofar as the latter dissipates his creative energy by thinking of everything else other than God. Christ is one-mindedness and his creative energy is a constant in God and his mind is filled with no thought but God.Our ordinary senses depict a world of duality whereas all mystical experiences overcome this dichotomy. The Bible uses a term such as to “know” God which is similar to an experience of unspeakable love. A close parallel to understanding this concept was documented by Huxley after having ingested a hallucinogenic substance when he thereupon experienced becoming the flower he observed — breaching the dichotomy between the observer and the observed.\nIn some religious disciplines, meditation, which is replete in Buddhist scripture has the purpose of attaining one-mindedness or a state of stillness as a prelude to enlightenment. Thus, the body becomes neither a hinderance nor an aid to in this process. Purpose is.\nSpells and possession\nIn Christian thought, the resurrection is about transcendentalism of the body. To be body-conscious and to identify one’s self with the body is an unnatural state for those in quest for the kingdom of God. As thought produces form, lower vibrational thought is expressed asdense matter being physical in nature, whereas, in a higher state of consciousness, it engenders spiritual light and translucency of energy. Spells cast on people or even demonic possessions of people occur to them resonating at lower frequencies, but, for them who are on a higher plane, those spells boomerangs on the initiator. The black artswork only against people who have already condemned themselves and who operate at the lower level of the psychical field.\nFor this reason, it is important to understand that the original sin of man — or the decent from a sublime plane to a lower one — represents the mind’s decision to replace the Knowledge (thought) of God with perception. In the latter realm, the body symbolises the expression of a perceptual state of separation from God and every-body, which is experientially real. The “word,” therefore, cannot in a real sense become flesh because the word is God (higher plane) whereas the flesh (lower plane) is outside the domain of His kingdom. The closest analogy to reconcile the irreconcilable is God is light (the word) and in Him there is no darkness (the flesh). But in experience, the physical plane is very real with souls (light) appearing to be trapped in bodies (matter). No wonder, Einstein’s famous equation E= MC2equates matter to being trapped light! On the other hand, when translucency is attainedthe resurrection restores this misperception by raising the thought vibration where the physical and material are completely undone. Thus, “Ye are the light of the world,” the Holy Bible proclaims with certainty and clarity.\nMeditation\nMost religions either exalt the body or condemn its purpose. Some exalt its beauty while others scorn its appetite. Worse still, in meditation, some focus on its impermanence, corruptibility and disintegration while others venerate its supposedly strange powers and abilities. This preoccupation with the body makes the error real and diverts the energy of the spiritual aspirant. Such extreme distortions actually happens from a psychological standpoint of resistance or fear to mask the true nature of man— who is Spirit—and, therefore, this action perpetuates the sense of victimisation and vulnerability and, in some bizarre way, justifies this notion to be true. In contrast, the resurrection demonstrates invulnerability.\nBy unnecessarily focussing on the body, the mind continues to harbour lower frequency thought forms with self-aggrandisement of needs. The only way out of this dilemma is the middle path prescribed by Lord Buddha: we must neither exalt nor degrade the body but use it as an instrument to transcend its earthly trappings so that we re-align the purpose of mind to attune with its true nature of being while relinquishing the ego.\nFalse construct of reality\nConcepts such as Absolute Reality where nothing but God exists is difficult to grasp in post-separated world. In contrast, this post-separation world is based on perception, and the mind is highly variable and always uncertain. This uncertainty always demands a need to fill the vacillating mind with illusory thoughts. In a group study of behavioural perception, a renowned psychologist played a chanting of, “That is embarrassing!” several times. Then he scripted a message on the screen while the same chant was played, “That isn’t my receipt.,” and the audience were bewildered to hear that this same chant fitted the words on the screen. The eyes take on an electrical signal based on expectations and reconstructed the chant to fit the message. He concluded that we see nothing that is real but that we construct our own false reality.\nTo correctly perceive the body, we should become aware that it exists outside the mind. Properly speaking, the mind of man is a function of the Mind of God. Here there is no dichotomy and thus cause and effect are therefore really one and the same thing. Since God has no body, man yet believes he exists as a body but he is free to believe infinitely even in a lie no matter how strong the impression is. Strictly speaking that thought is an illusory one, at any rate. Therefore, from the mystical perspective, we cannot accord the body any reality because only God is Real. Either the body exists or God ceases or vice versa.\nFocussing wrongly on the body in this sense is a barrier to knowing God. Yet God is not mocked according to St. Paul. This may run contradictory to formal beliefs, but there are compellingly reasons to see it in another light. As the body is a separation device, “The wages of sin is death.” The resurrection is therefore the overcoming of death, which is simply the re-establishment of the separated mind with that of God’s. It is akin to a state of oneness-joined-as-one.\nReversing cause and effect\nBirth and death have no special merit except that they both re-enact and perpetuate the separation notwithstanding the entry into or the exit of the lower state of vibration. Life in the physical plane manifests as though thought has no power or causal effect. We are buffeted and bruised by everything external and the impact of them is experienced by the body where it “perceptually” witnesses to this schema. Thus, from a state of mindfulness to a state of mindlessness, the descent which reflects the separation from God, the body becomes the hallmark of all who “have sinned and come short of the hisglory.” But the resurrection, on the other hand, is one of great importance since it restores the function of Causation to cause in the mind. Accordingly, the Bible says, “If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye, shall say unto this mount, remove hence to yonder place and it shall be removed and nothing shall be impossible.”The practice of mindfulness is therefore essential to the path of redemption. Here a reversal of thought — cause and effect — is urgently required so that what was an external infliction is no longer perceived that way but is instead perceived as a projection of mind. All misperceptions have to be healed within the mind, for there is no external world “out there” to adjust and manipulate. This idea also resonates with modern scientific thought.\nThe awakening\nIn summary, it must be understood that the body is a projection of a misthought — an illusory thought, so to speak. Only thoughts, which are in accord with God’s,are Real whereas all others are outside His Realm. Once a misthoughtis corrected — or the sleep of forgetfulness which weaves a dream-like world is undone — it inevitably gives rise to the “wakened” state of mind akin to the resurrection.",

    "text": "MELBOURNE, Fla. – Fifteen years ago, when the housing market crashed and the Space Shuttle program was coming to an end, there were real concerns about the future of Melbourne.\nFast forward to today, and those concerns are long gone. The Melbourne Orlando International Airport has played a huge role in the area’s economic growth, but not in the traditional way.\nWhen you walk onto the tarmac at the airport, what you’ll notice is not necessarily all the planes taking off, but rather all the businesses landing here.\n“So the terminal itself has doubled in size, which is really nice, but most of the North end was not there (10 years ago),” said Greg Donovan, the airport’s executive director.\nIn fact, he says, over the past decade, the number of people who work at the Melbourne Orlando International Airport property on any given day has doubled to about $20,000 people.\n“Certainly when the shuttle program started to wind down, there was an awful lot of apprehension of what’s next,” said Donovan. “Typically in the space program, it takes several years for new programs to generate. What’s really unique about the Melbourne area and this part of Central Florida is we have just a very unique workforce, generationally, going back all the way to the beginning of the NASA programs, all the way back to the beginning of space program.”\nToday, more than 80% of the airport’s revenue comes from leasing land to aerospace companies that have landed here. Embraer manufactures six different business jets here, Northrop Grumman is designing the B-21, the next-generation stealth bomber, while STS performs maintenance on commercial airlines.\nIn all, the airport generated an estimated economic impact of $3.2 billion.\n“People don’t want to leave. We love this area, right? So when that all took place, our leaders in this area, long before me, really reached out to the aerospace industry and said to the traditional aerospace industry, there are ways that we can tap into this labor pool,” said Donovan. “So we made a concentrated effort to make sure that we have the right infrastructure. What’s common in aerospace is you need runways, you need taxiways, and you need a labor force that’s educated. We put over $100 million worth of improvements. All three runways have been rebuilt. We’ve worked with the state of Florida and the federal government, the FAA, to bring in companies over here, and we’ve done really well competing against other states and other locations in the country.”\nAs for what’s coming next?\n“Automated aircraft, E-V-T-O-L, it’s called Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft,” said Donovan. “These are smaller aircraft that can get into urban centers. So you think about South Florida, how much time it takes to drive from point A to point B, if you can eclipse that by an aircraft, and it’s an electric aircraft, very environmentally sensitive aircraft, that’s going to be the answer to the future and I think we’ll see production, I think we’ll see operation here.”\nGet today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily :\nCopyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick have been labelled as \"spoiled brats\" over their recent performances.\nThe criticism came from none other than Chiefs legend Dante Hall, who despite his relationship with the pair, did not hold back with his criticism.\n\"It's like my little kids running around here on Christmas Day,\" the 45-year-old said on 'Good Morning Football' . \"We got you a Christmas tree filled with presents, and you're acting like spoiled little brats. These guys know I love them.\n\"So, as a friend, as a brother, I had to call you out. This is not a good look. I'm watching the game with my kids, my daughter loves Patrick , and you're acting like that? C'mon, guys! Be better, and I think the team will be better.\"\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift gets seal of approval from Chiefs heiress set to inherit £12.2 billion\nREAD MORE: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld rumours fuelled as actress spotted at Buffalo Bills game\nHall's criticism of Mahomes and Kelce came after the Chiefs legend explained that the star quarterback needed to play like Tom Brady, mainly in how he approaches game situations and not forcing the issue.\nHe said: \"It's time to be 'Checkdown' Tom Brady. Falling in love with the swing route, the check-downs. These plays have been there for the taking and that's pretty much what we need to get to, right? Check-down, when it's there, take it. Don't look for the big play. Get a rhythm. If it's a fice-yard check-down, throw it to him.\"\nHall explained that the behaviour of Mahomes and Kelce, such as throwing their helmets and shouting at teammates and officials, might be contributing to Kansas City's struggles this NFL season. \"Body language is everything,\" said the former wide receiver. \"When you are screaming and yelling at your players, that permeates negativity.\"\nHe added: \"What you have had in your first five years, that poker face, we know we're going to win this in the end, that permeates positivity. Get back to being positive and not so negative on the sideline with your guys. Be better and I think the team will be better.\"\nShannon Sharpe also criticised the Chiefs' star duo after their loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. He suggested the team needs to get back to basics to overcome their current slump.\nWith only two games left, the Chiefs need to quickly figure out how to improve or their Super Bowl title defence could end prematurely.\n ",

    "text": "Despite their crucial role in saving lives, Uganda's nurses and midwives are grappling with severe challenges, including long hours, minimal pay, and a lack of support.\nMany healthcare workers feel physically and emotionally exhausted as they continue to perform beyond their training to meet the demands of an overstretched healthcare system.\"We are awake day and night, fighting to save lives, yet we are not rewarded for the sacrifices we make,\" said Joan Mugabi , Vice Chairperson of the Uganda Nurses and Midwives Union (UNMU).With grueling shifts and little rest, nurses and midwives are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the lack of recognition and support from the government.\nThe situation is exacerbated by delayed deployment for nursing and midwifery graduates, with many remaining unemployed for years.\n\"Those who finished in 2003 are still in their homes. Kindly hear us out and put them on the list,\" Mugabi urged, highlighting the plight of thousands of qualified nurses left without jobs despite an urgent need for healthcare professionals.\nAdding to the discontent is the government's focus on recruiting enrolled certificate-level nurses, while those with bachelor's and master's degrees are often overlooked.\n\"The government must employ all nurses,\" demanded Annet Birungi, General Secretary of UNMU, pointing to the lack of career progression opportunities and inadequate working conditions that are driving dissatisfaction in the sector.\nWhile President Museveni's recent scholarship initiative for 18 nursing students was welcomed, it has been criticized as insufficient to meet the sector's growing needs.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Uganda Business Governance Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

    "text": "[Passer au contenu principal](#main)\nVictoire morale des Pistons, mais 28e revers de suite\nLes Pistons ont tenu tête aux puissants Celtics en forçant la tenue d'une prolongation, jeudi, mais Boston a eu le dernier mot pour s'imposer 128-122 et infliger une 28e défaite consécutive à Detroit.\nDéjà détenteurs du record pour la plus longue séquence de défaites au cours d'une même saison, les Pistons ont maintenant égalé le record absolu avec ce 28e revers de suite. Ils partagent ce record de médiocrité avec les\n76ers de Philadelphie, qui ont aussi perdu 28 matchs consécutifs lors des saisons 2014-2015 et 2015-2016.\nLa dernière victoire des Pistons remonte au 28 octobre alors qu'ils avaient signé un deuxième gain en autant de soirs pour amorcer la saison avec une fiche de 2-1.\nLes Pistons ont amorcé le match avec la ferme intention de mettre fin à leur triste séquence malgré le défi qui s'offrait à eux face à la meilleure équipe de la NBA. Ils ont même dominé le deuxième quart 36-20 pour rentrer au vestiaire avec une étonnante avance de 66-47 à la mi-temps. Le vent a toutefois tourné en faveur des Celtics au troisième quart : ils ont eu le dessus 35-16 pour revenir à égalité 82-82 au moment d'entamer le quatrième quart.\nDetroit est parvenu à prendre une avance de 100-96 avec moins de cinq minutes à jouer, mais Boston a alors inscrit 10 points d'affilée pour passer devant 106-100.\nLes Pistons ont ramené le pointage à égalité 106-106 et\nJayson Tatum a ensuite procuré une avance de 108-106 à Boston avec 8,1 secondes à jouer à la suite d'un contre illégal de Cade Cunningham, qui a repoussé le tir de Tatum alors que le ballon venait à peine de toucher le panneau.\nCunningham a ensuite raté un tir de trois points qui aurait donné une avance tardive aux Pistons, mais\nBojan Bogdanovic s'est emparé du rebond pour envoyer le match en prolongation en égalisant avec 4,1 secondes au cadran.\nLes Pistons ont pris les devants 115-113 en prolongation, mais les Celtics ont alors pris le contrôle du match avec une séquence de 13-4 qui a fait passer le pointage à 126-119 en leur faveur.\nKristaps Porzingis a brillé offensivement avec une récolte de 35 points (13-en-21) en plus de récupérer huit rebonds. Tatum, peu efficace avec un 11-en-31 du périmètre (2-en-11 du centre-ville), a tout de même conclu la rencontre avec 31 points, 10 aides, sept rebonds et cinq vols. Derrick White a fourni 23 points.\nCunningham a mené les Pistons avec 31 points, neuf aides, trois vols et deux contres.\nJaden Ivey a ajouté 22 points et 10 rebonds tandis que Bogdanovic et Jalen Duren ont réalisé des doublés avec des récoltes respectives de 17 points et 12 rebonds et de 15 points et 14 rebonds.\nLes Celtics étaient privés de l'ailier étoile\nJaylen Brown, qui est blessé au dos.\nLes Celtics ont signé une quatrième victoire de suite, une neuvième en dix rencontres. Ils disputeront un deuxième match en autant de soirs, vendredi, face aux\nRaptors de Toronto.\nAilleurs dans la NBA\nPacers 120 - Bulls 104\nIND :\nTyrese Haliburton a marqué 21 points en plus d'améliorer son sommet personnel avec 20 aides.\nCHI : Récoltes respectives de 22 et 21 points pour\nPatrick Williams et DeMar DeRozan. Jazz 105 - Pelicans 112\nUTA :\nCollin Sexton a inscrit 26 points et Lauri Markkanen a ajouté 24 points et 10 rebonds.\nN-O :\nBrandon Ingram a marqué 26 points. 21 points, 10 rebonds et huit aides pour Zion Williamson. Mavericks 110 - Timberwolves 118\nDAL : Sans Luka Doncic et Kyrie Irving, Tim Hardaway Jr a mené l'attaque des Mavericks avec 32 points en provenance du banc.\nMIN : Anthony Edwards a été dominant avec une récolte de 44 points. Rudy Gobert a ajouté 20 points (7-en-7), 11 rebonds et trois contres.\nGrizzlies - Nuggets\nMEM :\nDEN :\nHeat - Warriors\nMIA :\nGS :\nSpurs - Trail Blazers\nSA :\nPOR :\nHornets - Lakers\nCHA :\nLAL :",
