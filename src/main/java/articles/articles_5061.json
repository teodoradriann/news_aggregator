    "title": "The digital currency platform Enet Crypto Center Limited successfully obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license, legalizing and regularizing transactions. | dailytimesleader.com | Serving West Point & Clay County Since 1867",
    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services\nSince 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enet’s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms.\nEnet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem.\nHolding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations.\nEnet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

    "text": "‘Lower the speed limit’: Dump truck slams into SUV and crashes into restaurant, killing 2\nWALTON, Ky. (WXIX/Gray News) - Two women were killed in a crash with a dump truck loaded with gravel Tuesday evening.\nAccording to the Boone County Sheriff’s Office, the crash involved the truck and an SUV at the intersection of U.S. 42 and Beaver Road.\nAuthorities said it appears the driver of the SUV went in front of the truck, and the dump truck driver tried to avoid a collision but could not.\nThe Bedrock Trucking dump truck ended up slamming into the SUV, with the force of the crash sending the truck off the road.\nThe truck struck four parked vehicles in a nearby restaurant parking lot and then crashed into the building.\nThe sheriff’s office said two women, identified as Eva Mulberry, 91 and Betty Hillard, 89, traveling in the SUV died at the scene with the 66-year-old driver being sent to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.\nThe dump truck driver was also taken to the hospital with minor injuries.\nNo one inside the restaurant was hurt.\nSpeed and alcohol/drug impairment factors are not believed to be factors but will still be investigated, sheriff’s officials said.\nAll drivers and passengers wore seat belts.\nAuthorities said contributing factors in the crash include limited visibility at the intersection due to the landscape of the roadway.\nNo charges have been filed, and both drivers, who were not immediately identified, are cooperating with the investigation.\nOne of the restaurant’s owners, Leslie Lovelace, said this is not the first crash at the intersection and it’s something that has been a problem for several years.\nShe said she hopes a change is made now in light of this latest crash to prevent another tragedy.\n“Either put some kind of a stop right there, lower the speed limit, put some kind of caution ... something needs to go there because this will happen again,” Lovelace said.\nCopyright 2025 WXIX via Gray Local Media, Inc.

    "text": "MANAWA (WLUK) -- As Manawa celebrates 150 years, it's clear heavy rains play a part in its more recent history. A downpour Thursday forced planned events celebrating the city to be moved indoors. An estimated one inch of rain fell throughout the afternoon, with residents fearing more flooding like the area suffered just a month ago. Tory Suehs told us, “Well, it kind of looks almost like it’s going to flood again. And I was like, 'Oh no.' But thankfully it hasn’t gotten worse,\" she said. \"We thought it was going to miss us, because when I looked earlier it looked it was going to miss us, but then I got here and it’s been downpouring ever since.” Back on July 5, the embankment next to the Manawa Dam [eroded away due to heavy rainfall, which led to heavy local flooding.](https://fox11online.com/weather/weather-stories/photos-videos-heavy-rain-flash-flooding-wreak-havoc-on-northeast-wisconsin-manawa-waupaca-county-appleton-outagamie-county-brown-calumet-manitowoc-sheboygan-thunderstorms-evacuations-advisories-warnings-emergencies#) And while this latest rain is bringing back unpleasant reminders, residents say they believe the worst has already passed. “The dam isn’t going to break again, the water is bypassing, it’s going down river,\" said Rodney Krueger. \"So I really don’t think there’s anything to be concerned about at this point.” Those celebrating Manawa are keeping their spirits up. “It seems like we’ve had our share of rain this year and Manawa sure doesn’t want any more,\" said Ronda Mollica, a Manawa resident. “Rain rain go away, come again another day.” Krueger emphasized that he doesn't want a repeat [of the July flooding.](Evers' disaster declaration aids Manawa recovery efforts after heavy rainfall, dam erosion) If you can safely do so, Chime In with a picture or video of the weather conditions near you: “Is that saying that if we get another 6 inches, or 8 inches in another 30 minutes would that hurt is?\" he said. \"Yeah it would probably suck again. But I think we’ll be okay.” Manawa's 150th anniversary celebration will go until August 3 with fireworks, a parade, and a time capsule ceremony.",

    "title": "Viltrox Unveils Four New Prime Lenses and a Clever Charging Case",
    "text": "This year’s CP+ in Yokohama, Tokyo, is the gift that keeps on giving. Viltrox provided attendees with a look at four brand new lenses and a new battery charging case.\nAs reported by DPReview and Digital Camera World , Viltrox is using social media in lieu of press releases to announce its latest gear. In a post to its Instagram, Viltrox shared images taken from its booth at CP+. These images show unreleased new products, which Viltrox says are “attracting the attention of countless photography enthusiasts and professionals.”\nThe Instagram caption lists the names of each new lens, which is all the information known thus far about these latest releases. However, looking at the Instagram post and the moniker series each lens is listed under, one can ascertain at least some details.\nThe first lens shown at CP+ is the Viltrox AF 35 mm f/1.2 LAB FE. The LAB series is Viltrox’s top-of-the-line performance glass, promising the company’s best optical performance. With an aperture of f/1.2, this could be another great option for photographers who want fast glass that doesn’t cost much money.\nPrevious LAB series lenses such as the AF 135mm f/1.8 FE , a great E-mount prime lens that punches far above its weight. Speaking of the AF 135mm f/1.8 LAB lens, Viltrox unveiled at CP+ that it will bring this lens to Nikon Z mount, providing Nikon shooters an alternative to the fantastic but pricey Nikon Z 135mm f/1.8 S Plena .\nNext on the list is the Viltrox AF 50mm f/2 FE/Z. This lens for Sony E-mount and Nikon Z-mount has no special moniker, so it seems just to be a “regular” addition to Viltrox’s lineup.\nIt’s a similar story with the third new Viltrox lens, the AF 85mm f/1.4 Pro FE. Contrasting the LAB series, prior Pro series lenses such as the AF 75mm f/1.2 Pro feature a weather-resistant design as well as autofocus systems suitable for video with minimal breathing. However, they don’t promise the same performance as the flagship LAB lenses.\nViltrox produces relatively affordable lenses for mirrorless and cinema cameras. However, with no price information offered just yet, photographers can only go by Viltrox’s proven track record. It’s unlikely the company will change course with its general pricing strategy.\nDual-Bay Battery Charging Case Finishing out the new gear from Viltrox is an addition to their already popular line of power accessories. Looking like something that Apple would have put out instead, it introduced a Dual-Bay Battery Charging Case series for Sony, Nikon, Canon, and Fujifilm.\nThe Dual-Bay Battery Charging Case offers a quick charge for 2320mAh — from empty to full in about two hours. The case also has a display on the front to precisely track the battery capacity. It also offers multiple charging protocol support compatible with PD3.0, QC, Samsung AFC, Huawei FCP, and Apple 2.4A. Viltrox’s announcement shared to their public Discord also explains that it will have seamless OEM and third-party battery compatibility. Weighing in it just 8.1 ounces (230 grams), it is another portable option for charging batteries on the go.\nPricing and Availability Further details including the pricing and availability for these latest Viltrox lenses is not yet known. However, the Viltrox Dual-Bay Battery Charging Case is available now for $69.99.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to allow a plea seeking permission to visit the location of recently demolished centuries-old mosque Masjid Akhunji in the Mehrauli area of the city and offer prayers on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat.\nThe mosque adjoining madrasa Bahrul Uloom and various graves were razed to the ground in the wee hours of January 30 by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).\nAccording to the civic authorities, the demolition drive was pursuant to the recommendation of the religious committee held on January 4.\nOn Friday, the plea seeking entry to the land of the mosque for visiting the graves of elders and to offer night long prayers on the occasion of Shab-e-Baraat, was taken up before single-judge bench of Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav.\n“At this stage, this court, under the facts of the present case, is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is accordingly dismissed,” the high court said while dismissing the plea.\nThe court observed that the petition is of the nature of a “mandatory injunction.”\n“..The respondents in their status report have unequivocally stated that the structure has already been demolished and that the order of status quo passed by this court is being maintained on the site,” Justice Kaurav remarked pointing out that the main petition in the matter is to be appeared on March 7, Thursday.\nThe petitioner’s counsel submitted that the occasion is important for Muslims to perform the prayers for forgiveness throughout the night and to visit graveyards. The counsel also argued that the mosque was 700 years old and the civic authority was demolishing it illegally.",

    "text": "Scotland could be hit by a deluge of snow this weekend when a second storm could strike just days after Storm Gerrit.\nAfter thousands were left without power this week due to stormy conditions, more unsettled weather could be on the way due to a powerful Atlantic jet stream.\nMet Office forecasters say ‘treacherous conditions’ could hit Scotland on Saturday, bringing gusts of up to 60mph and 20cm of snow on northern hills.\nThis weather front could lead to a further winter storm, set to be named Storm Henk, according to senior meteorologist Jim Dale of the British Weather Services. The weather expert told i that this storm bring “ferocious” winds and “may cause far more chaos” than Storm Gerrit.\nHe told the publication: “I encourage anyone travelling on New Year’s Eve to do so sooner rather than later on Sunday as these winds will be ferocious.”\nMet Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned that this ‘powerful system’ could bring similar heavy rainfall to Storm Gerrit and ‘very significant snow’ when it reaches Scotland.\nSpeaking about the 10-day weather forecast, he said: “Storm Gerrit is moving away by this stage, but another lowest forming out of the Atlantic again picked up by a powerful Jetstream and deepening rapidly as it approaches Ireland and the UK during Friday night and into Saturday.”\nHe added: “So the recipe there once again for some substantial snow over northern hills predominantly. But across Scotland certainly over the southern uplands and then into the highlands and Grampians some very significant snow building up through Saturday, 20cm plus over the tops of the mountains. So once again some treacherous conditions with the wind, rain and hills snow to contend with on Saturday. Tricky day for travelling in many places certainly.”\nScotland could be hit by a deluge of snow this weekend\nThe Met Office also warned that New Year’s Eve could be wet and windy, with heavy rain forecast across most of the UK. Milder conditions are expected in southern UK areas, while cold temperatures will remain in Scotland.\nIt comes after a ‘major incident’ was declared in Scotland due to Storm Gerrit, with a string of weather warnings issued on Wednesday.\nThousands of homes remain without power and motorists and rail passengers face continued disruption after Storm Gerrit battered the country.\nEngineers worked to restore power to around 14,000 customers, though Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution warned some could be without supply into Friday.\nHigh winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country while a Met Office yellow weather warning was in force across much of Scotland throughout Wednesday.\nThe weather conditions also disrupted travel, with some drivers trapped for hours on the A9 which was closed at Drumtocher in the Highlands due to snow.\nOn the railways, many routes remain closed and will not reopen until safety checks have been carried out.\nDon’t miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.
