    "text": "Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the country, with 7,500 women diagnosed with it every year. 'I had signs of ovarian cancer and want others to know them'\n29 March 2025 Share Save Alice Cunningham BBC News, Suffolk Share Save\nJoss Cook Joss Cook found herself with all the key symptoms of ovarian cancer before she was diagnosed in 2021\nIn early 2021 Joss Cook began suffering from abdominal pains, bloating, needed to urinate more and quickly felt full when eating - key symptoms of ovarian cancer. The 57-year-old from Kesgrave, Suffolk, visited a doctor who initially thought she had irritable bowel syndrome. Months later, after being sent to A&E by her GP, she was diagnosed with the cancer. About 7,500 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year in the UK and it is the sixth most common cancer in women, according to Cancer Research UK. Mrs Cook has been trying to raise more awareness of the symptoms of the disease during Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.\n\"I'd just come over the age of 50 and I was starting to put these pains down to the menopause, I thought that probably what my uncomfortable tummy was,\" Mrs Cook explained. \"I was still having regular periods and I had some quite bad cramping so I thought, 'something doesn't feel right'.\" Mrs Cook's symptoms worsened over the following months: her appetite \"diminished\", she needed to urinate more and by September 2021 her stomach had distended to the point that she looked pregnant.\nJoss Cook Mrs Cook believed she should have had a CA125 blood test sooner\nTests by her GP failed to identify the issue, so she was sent to A&E. \"At about 02:00 in the morning I was taken through for a CT scan,\" Mrs Cook said. \"At 07:00, 08:00, the consultant came around and said: 'I'm really sorry to tell you, you've got two tumours and we need to operate.' \"They removed two tumours - one 15cm and one 25cm - then I had a full hysterectomy and a debulking procedure.\" Mrs Cook has been clear of her cancer since her treatment and she explained staying positive throughout the experience helped her.

    "text": "Disputa Esequibo: Maduro ordena \"acciones defensivas\" tras llegada de buques británicos a Guyana Nicolás Maduro y el presidente de Guyana habían acordado resolver la disputa por una vía diplomática. El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, ordenó este jueves una acción defensiva en el océano Atlántico en respuesta a la llegada de un buque de guerra británico a las costas de Guyana, lo que ha disparado nuevamente la tensión entre los países suramericanos que mantienen una disputa territorial. \"He ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB) sobre el Caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensivo como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país\", dijo el mandatario. El anuncio lo hizo frente a la cúpula militar, durante una reunión que fue transmitida de manera obligatoria en la radio y televisión, en la que se comunicó con un grupo de efectivos castrenses que concretaron \"la primera fase\" de esta operación, lo que consistió en un despliegue sobre tierra y aguas del estado Sucre. Más información: [Disputa territorial entre Venezuela y Guyana, ¿de qué se trata?](https://www.lafm.com.co/internacional/disputa-territorial-entre-venezuela-y-guyana-de-que-se-trata) Maduro no dio detalles sobre el alcance y duración de esta operación pero insistió en que la llegada del HMS Trent británico es una \"amenaza inaceptable\" que es una \"ruptura\" de los acuerdos que suscribió con su par guyanés, Irfaan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre, cuando se comprometieron a no amenazarse mutuamente y evitar incidentes relacionadas con la disputa. \"Venezuela no se puede quedar de brazos cruzados frente a una amenaza, estamos respondiendo en la medida proporcional\", aseguró, tras reiterar que apuesta por la diplomacia y la paz. El líder chavista criticó que Guyana haya desoído los pedidos de Venezuela de no aceptar la llegada del barco británico a sus costas.

La disputa escaló luego de que Venezuela aprobara el 3 de diciembre, en un referendo unilateral, anexionarse la zona bajo pleito, un área de casi 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados que está bajo control de Guyana y cuya controversia está en manos de la Corte Internacional de Justicia.

The mystery of a Virgin Mary statue in Italy that 'wept tears of blood' has been solved.\nGisella Cardia proclaimed in 2016 that the Madonna di Trevignano was crying blood and giving her revelations to share with believers who flocked to receive its blessing and hand over tens of thousands of dollars in donations.\nProsecutors in the port city of Civitavecchia opened a fraud investigation in 2023, ordering swab tests of the blood-stained porcelain cheeks that were previously speculated to have been pig's blood.\nThe lab results surfaced last week, showing the blood matched the owner Cardia's genetic profile.\nHowever, her lawyer, Solange Marchignoli, said the DNA analysis must also show if it was a single-profile or mixed.\n'If the profile is single, it means that it is only Cardia's and she put it there, so in this case we would go to trial,' Marchignoli told Italian news outlet Corriere della Sera.\n'But if, as expected, the profile is mixed, it means that the DNA found on the statue also contains Cardia's DNA, which we expect because she used, kissed it and handled it.\nCardia has reportedly left her home in Trevignano and no one, not even her lawyer, knows where she is.\nHundreds of people flocked to a town in Italy to see a statue of the Virgin Mary that its owner claimed cried tears of blood\nGisella Cardia proclaimed in 2016 that the Madonna di Trevignano was crying blood and giving her revelations to share with believers.

The case was registered at Sehwan police station, Jamshoro district, on Saturday, a day after Auqaf manager, Muhammad Zubair Baloch, was suspended from his job after serving at the shrine for over 12 years, reported The Express Tribune. A private employee, Ali Raza Gopang, was also named in the FIR along with Baloch under sections 407, 409, 380, 457, 427 and 34 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the newspaper reported. Gopang has not been arrested so far. He reportedly escaped from the city after the incident was unearthed. The complainant, Irshad Ali Samo, Auqaf administrator for Sukkur and Larkana divisions, told police that over 57 tolas of gold and 3,133 tolas of silver have been stolen from the shrine’s maalkhana [store], the news channel reported. He stated that the shrine received 210.6 tolas of gold in a span of almost 20 years from November 22, 2004, to August 17, 2023.

    "text": "One of the most satisfying elements of managing others is the opportunity to help them discover, apply and improve upon their unique strengths. Before any manager can do this though, it’s helpful for them to identify their own.\nIn my many conversations with emerging leaders, graduate students and new managers, I am taken with the fact that a very basic question proves difficult to answer: What are your unique strengths? What are the things you do best, the things you most enjoy and from which you derive great satisfaction?\nMany have never been asked or even considered this question before. When planning for a bigger, better future, whether as an individual or as part of a team or organization, considering the assets you have at your disposal is a logical first step. Here is where managers have a terrific opportunity.\nHelping individuals identify their unique strengths, those things they do better than most, can be one of the most rewarding experiences in a manager’s career. One way to facilitate this discussion is to use assessments designed to help identify individual preferences and thinking styles. While there are many tools that fit this description, one of the most comprehensive is the Harrison Assessment, which places a focus on those things individuals prefer to do and those they would rather not do. For the latter, preferring not to do something doesn’t mean they won’t or can’t. It usually does mean though that these are items best left to others who do enjoy and/or prefer them.\nHigh levels of job satisfaction are found in people who are tasked with doing things they prefer and enjoy. Because they are good at them, they get positive feedback and are motivated to do more. As they do more, they get even better, so their satisfaction and enjoyment grow. And so does their contribution to the organization.\nOf course, just about every job carries with it tasks and responsibilities we aren’t thrilled with. However, armed with the knowledge of those items we do enjoy, skillful managers can begin to design job responsibilities that align more closely with the unique strengths of each member of their team. The impact this has on individual job satisfaction and team performance cannot be overstated.\nFor more information on ways your managers can utilize the Harrison Assessment to drive greater job satisfaction and performance, contact me at joe@ajstrategy.com.",
