    "text": "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (KAKE) - A 92-year-old man has proved age is just a number by breaking the Guinness World Record for the oldest person to cross the Grand Canyon.\nThe Guinness World Records said the man, Alfredo Aliaga Burdio, came all the way from Berlin, Germany to complete his trek on October 15, 2023, becoming the oldest person to cross the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim on foot (male).\n“I have hiked in the Grand Canyon many times in my life,” he said. \"I came here with my wife, Ingrid, quite a few times and we did cross it from rim to rim several times.\"\nBurdio&apos;s wife died in 2006 from ALS, the GWR says, and he wanted to revisit the place they traveled. Together with his daughter and nine-year-old grandson, Burdio set out once again to hike the canyon rim to rim.\nAgain in October of 2022, he crossed the Grand Canyon yet again with his son in just four days. The GWR says it was during this trip that he came up with the idea to attempt to break the record.\n“I had read about the previous record holder, Mr. John Jepkema whom I admired immensely,” said Burdio. “I knew that I was only a few months younger than Mr. Jepkema had been and thought that I had a great shot at setting a new record the following year.”\nIn January of 2023, Burdio says he began training for what would be the hike of a lifetime by walking 8 miles every day.\nFinally, nine months later, Burdio accomplished his mission and broke the record. The GWR says he was also greeted by the Tucson Fire Department during his trek, who awarded him a patch, making him an honorary member of the fire department.\nThe entire trip took Burdio 34 hours and 2 minutes, but his actual hiking time was 21 hours and 15 minutes according to the GWR .\nBurdio says he is now looking forward to all 2024 has in store for him.",

His death was confirmed last week.\nWeinstein, a mother of four and grandmother of seven, was an English teacher who specialized in helping children with special needs, Kibbutz Nir Oz said.\n\"For the past few years she has also taught Mindfulness to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety caused by the ongoing rocket fire from Gaza,\" the kibbutz said. \"Judy was a poet, entrepreneur, and pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement that he's \"devastated\" to learn of Weinstein's death.\n\"We are holding Judith and Gad's four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts,\" Biden said. \"I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me. They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal. And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.\"\nWeinstein was the last American woman being held hostage by Hamas who had not been released, according to the Hostage Families Forum.\nPresident Joe Biden issued the following statement:\n\"Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judith Weinstein is also believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7. This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week's news that Judith's beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas. We are holding Judith and Gad's four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts. I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me. They have been living through hell for weeks.

    "title": "Historic surf hits California coastline, prompts multiple evacuations - Breitbart",
    "text": "Dec. 28 (UPI) — Flooding and evacuation warnings are in effect in multiple California counties as dangerously high waves pounded the coast Thursday. Marin Country residents were ordered to evacuate Thursday morning due to possible flooding at Stinson Beach after forecasters predicted severe weather conditions in the North Bay area. Evacuation warnings extended to Santa Cruz County and Capitola Village through the afternoon. The National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory for the Coastal North Bay and a high surf warning for the central and northern Californian coastline through 3 a.m. Friday. Despite multiple evacuation warnings, residents and tourists couldn’t help but stare in awe at the biggest surf to hit the California coastline since January. “It’s really beautiful. It’s just breathtaking. It shows you the strength of Mother Nature,” Mike Buyer told the San Francisco Chronicle from Pacifica, where high waves surged up into the Pacific Hotel Breeze parking lot and rolled high along the pier. Thursday’s swell also drew highly skilled surfers at Mavericks Beach near Princeton-by-the-Sea, where the waves can climb to 50 or 60 feet tall. Surfer Grant Washburn, who has surfed Mavericks for decades, said the waves were “historic and a little scary — a lot scary.” The high surf also cause serious damage and prompted multiple water rescues along the San Luis Obispo Coast. The flooding overturned a pickup truck in Arroyo Grande Creek and washed RVs into the surf line at the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area. “The waves and high tide were just overwhelming the beach,” Oceano resident Ed Collins said. Cal Fire, Port San Luis Harbor Patrol, San Luis Ambulance and a California Highway Patrol helicopter all responded to an incident in which a hiker fell off a cliff at Pirate’s Cove and fell into the water Thursday morning. Additional units were requested to deal with “potential complexity with the waves,” according to The Tribune. The hiker was rescued from the cliff having sustained only minor injuries. It’s already been a big week for California, and there is more forecasted to come. Thursday’s high tide hit northern California right after it faced southerly wind and stormy conditions on Wednesday. Southern California is expected to dodge the poor conditions hitting the northern coastline. Another swell of the same size class is anticipated for this weekend, with a swell direction that might impact the southern coastline more than the northern.",

    "text": "«En invierno es normal que estén mal, pero, ya en verano, deberían estar bien. Siempre estamos igual», señala Mario, un joven de San Pedro que ayer daba una de sus primeras caminatas estivales por el paseo marítimo de la localidad. «Yo procuro organizarme los fines de semana para ir a las playas de los municipios próximos», agrega, a su lado, su amigo Javier.\nPiedras; aglomeraciones de restos segados de césped; colectores en medio de los arenales; y acumulaciones de algas en las orillas, algunas con días de exposición bajo el sol veraniego de Marbella , predominan en buena parte del litoral sampedreño en las primeras jornadas del periodo de mayor afluencia de viajeros en un municipio cuya economía está estrechamente ligada al turismo .\nEl único signo de mantenimiento del litoral son los surcos de unas rodaduras del camión que retira la basura a primera hora de la mañana.\nY, sin apenas tiempo para actuar en la costa, Gobierno local y oposición se cruzan responsabilidades y reproches.\n«No tenemos quien venga a limpiar las playas de San Pedro. Las algas ya están secas, por lo que tienen mosquitos alrededor. La orilla sigue llena de piedras y chinos. Entrar en el agua es una odisea, pero eso ya es otro cantar», lamenta la concejal de Opción Sampedreña, María Luisa Parra.\n«¿Los sampedreños no pagamos impuestos?», se pregunta la edil.\nEl concejal Manuel Osorio lamenta la mala imagen que ofrece «la tarjeta de presentación» de San Pedro y reclama al teniente alcalde de la localidad, Javier García, que pida recursos al Ayuntamiento.\nLa formación sampedreña baraja la posibilidad de organizar una protesta contra la situación de las playas. «Va tocando otra vez», señala Osorio, en alusión a la manifestación que su formación impulsó el pasado verano, también contra el estado del litoral , y que sacó a la calle a cerca de 300 vecinos.\nEl Gobierno local asegura que la desaparición de la arena por los temporales de invierno o por quedar sepultada bajo las propias piedras hace «inviable» los trabajos de mantenimiento, ya sean manuales o con maquinaria.\nAdemás, añade, eliminar las piedras ubicadas en zonas que carecen de base arenosa provocaría un vacío que permitiría al mar avanzar en detrimento de la playa.\n«No se trata de quitar piedra a toda costa, sino de actuar con planificación y sentido común », señala el Consistorio, que reivindica la importancia de que el litoral sampedreño cuente con espigones que lo protejan ante los temporales.\nSuscríbete para seguir leyendo",

    "text": "A formação de uma nova frente fria contribui para formação de nuvens e também para espalhar as chuvas sobre o centro-sul do Brasil nos próximos dias. Volumes maiores de precipitação ainda são esperados sobre o Sul do Brasil até o final de semana, onde pode chover mais 100mm em algumas localidades e provocar transtornos. Entre o Sudeste e o Centro-Oeste são esperadas chuvas moderadas entre São Paulo e Mato Grosso do Sul e as precipitações mais intensas devem ocorrer especialmente sobre o interior de Minas Gerais, Goiás e Mato Grosso, onde devem provocar um aumento gradual da umidade do solo até as áreas mais ao norte das duas regiões. As chuvas vão marcar também a diminuição do calor na maior parte das áreas produtoras. Com o aumento das instabilidades o calor e os incêndios devem diminuir de forma significativa no final desta primeira quinzena de outubro. Moagem de cana atinge 39 milhões de toneladas na 2ª quinzena de setembro Na segunda quinzena de setembro, as unidades produtoras da região Centro-Sul processaram 38,83 milhões de toneladas ante a 44,95 milhões da safra 2023/2024, registrando queda de -13,62%. No acumulado desde o início da safra 2024/2025 até 1º de outubro, a moagem atingiu 505,08 milhões de toneladas, ante 493,50 milhões de toneladas registradas no mesmo período no ciclo anterior – crescimento de 2,35 %. Operaram na segunda quinzena de setembro 258 unidades produtoras na região Centro-Sul, sendo 239 unidades com processamento de cana, nove empresas que fabricam etanol a partir do milho e dez usinas flex. No mesmo período, na safra 23/24, operaram 261 unidades produtoras. Na quinzena, duas unidades encerram a moagem, enquanto no acumulado já se contabilizam quatro unidades. No ciclo anterior, até o fim de setembro, três usinas haviam terminado com seu período de processamento de cana-de-açúcar. Em relação à qualidade da matéria-prima, o nível de Açúcares Totais Recuperáveis (ATR) registrado na última quinzena de setembro atingiu 160,01 kg de ATR por tonelada de cana-de-açúcar, contra 154,27 kg por tonelada na safra 2023/2024 – variação positiva de 3,72%. No acumulado da safra, o indicador marca 141,02 kg de ATR por tonelada, índice levemente superior (0,61%) ao do último ciclo na mesma posição.

    "text": "Es responsabilidad de cada usuario leer los permisos que le otorga a cada aplicación. (Imagen ilustrativa Infobae) Algunas aplicaciones móviles pueden comprometer la seguridad de los datos almacenados en nuestros teléfonos al solicitar permisos que no son esenciales para su funcionamiento . Por ejemplo, una aplicación de calculadora podría pedir acceso al álbum de fotos, algo innecesario para su propósito.\nA menudo, los usuarios omiten leer los términos y condiciones, aunque es altamente recomendable revisarlos antes de instalar una aplicación o suscribirse a un servicio. Esto puede prevenir posibles riesgos asociados con el uso indebido de datos personales.\nEl uso cotidiano de ciertas aplicaciones puede llevarnos a ignorar su impacto en la seguridad digital. A continuación, se presentan algunos ejemplos de aplicaciones que podrían poner en riesgo nuestra información personal, según ESET.\nLas aplicaciones de traducción acceden a una gran cantidad de información que puede ser personal. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Siete tipos de aplicaciones que pueden poner en peligro tus datos Estos tipos de aplicaciones pueden potencialmente poner en peligro los datos de los usuarios, pero es importante mencionar que es responsabilidad de cada uno leer los términos y permisos de las plataformas que utiliza.\nAplicaciones de traducción gratuitas Las aplicaciones de traducción procesan grandes volúmenes de información para generar textos traducidos. Traducir una palabra aislada no supone un gran desafío, pero la situación cambia al manejar párrafos o documentos completos. Según expertos de la compañía de ciberseguridad mencionada, este proceso puede implicar riesgos cuando se utilizan aplicaciones de traducción inseguras.\nPor ejemplo, si un abogado introduce el contenido de un contrato confidencial en una de estas plataformas, las consecuencias podrían incluir la violación de normativas como el GDPR (Reglamento General de Protección de Datos) o la exposición de información corporativa altamente sensible.\nNo es recomendable darle siempre todos los permisos a las aplicaciones. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Aplicaciones que cambian de formato ¿Has tenido que reducir el tamaño de un documento para enviarlo por correo electrónico o convertirlo a otro formato, como PDF? Una solución frecuente es utilizar herramientas en línea o aplicaciones especializadas para modificar el formato. Sin embargo, estos servicios procesan información que podría ser sensible , por lo que es fundamental asegurarse de usar únicamente aplicaciones confiables.\n“Todo lo que se ha dicho sobre la traducción de aplicaciones también se aplica a las aplicaciones que cambian de formato”, afirma Daniel Chromek, director de seguridad de la información de ESET.\nCalendarios compartidos Los calendarios compartidos suelen incluir contactos y requieren, al menos, la dirección de correo electrónico para compartir horarios, lo que puede plantear problemas de privacidad según el GDPR, advierte Chromek. Además, su uso puede ser confuso, llevando a los usuarios a compartir datos accidentalmente con personas no deseadas.\nLas aplicaciones suelen procesar mucha información, por tanto, es responsabilidad de cada usuario saber los términos. (Imagen ilustrativa Infobae) Aplicaciones y diarios para tomar notas El riesgo de usar aplicaciones para tomar notas varía según su propósito. Si solo las usas para listas de compras, el peligro es menor que si escribes notas de reuniones de negocios o almacenas contraseñas (para esto es mejor usar un gestor de contraseñas).\nAplicaciones públicas para compartir archivos Las aplicaciones públicas para compartir archivos, que suelen operar en la nube, pueden implicar riesgos de fuga de datos si el proveedor o la cuenta del usuario son vulnerados. No obstante, es posible aumentar la seguridad al combinarlas con soluciones de cifrado de datos.\nAplicaciones de mensajería Las aplicaciones de mensajería permiten funciones como llamadas, videollamadas y compartir archivos, lo que requiere permisos para acceder a la cámara, micrófono y almacenamiento. Algunas no cifran los datos que recopilan, haciéndolas vulnerables a ataques. Si son hackeadas, los atacantes pueden acceder a toda la información almacenada, incluidos datos confidenciales.\nAplicaciones de acceso remoto Las aplicaciones de acceso remoto permiten funciones como controlar a tu perro desde el trabajo o encender la calefacción antes de llegar a casa. Pero también pueden ser vulnerables. Chromek advierte que estos servicios pueden convertirse en un portal para que terceros accedan a tu dispositivo, lo administren y roben los datos almacenados en él, comprometiendo tu seguridad.",
