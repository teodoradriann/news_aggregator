    "text": "Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel has conferred Friendship Medal Award to the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to honour the organisation’s contributions to the advancement of social justice and global solidarity. The award was in appreciation of NLC’s unwavering support and commitment to fortifying the connections with Cuba, rooted in brotherhood, solidarity, and cooperation at labour levels. Cuban Ambassador to Nigeria, Miriam Morales, who presented the award to the NLC president, Comrade Joe Ajaero in Abuja, commended the recipient for the union’s contributions to the Cuban trade union movement and union’s efforts in denouncing aggressions against Cuba, with a special focus on condemning the economic blockade imposed by the United States. In response, Ajaero highlighted the need for the Nigerian government and international bodies to urge the West, particularly the United States, to lift the economic ban on Cuba as rooted in the pursuit of a new global economic order and the principles of democracy. He expressed gratitude for the award and conveyed goodwill messages to the Cuban government, while acknowledging the Cuban embassy‘s supportive role during challenges faced by NLC in especially in Imo State. He stressed the commitment to onward collaboration with the Cuban embassy and workers to eradicate social injustice and discrimination globally as he called for continued partnership in the interests of workers in both countries.",

    "text": "Rio Tinto and Edify Energy have signed two new solar and battery hybrid services agreements (HSAs) to increase the supply of reliable, competitively priced electricity to Rio Tinto’s Gladstone aluminium operations in Queensland.\nUnder the agreements, Rio Tinto will purchase 90% of the power and battery storage capacity generated by the Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations for 20 years. Edify Energy will build, own, and operate the projects, with construction due to begin in late 2025 and targeting completion in 2028.\nLocated in Central Queensland, the adjacent Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations, will together feature 600MWac 1 of solar and 600MW / 2,400MWh of battery storage.\nRio Tinto Chief Executive, Australia, Kellie Parker said: \"These agreements are integral to repowering our Gladstone aluminium operations with affordable, reliable and lower carbon energy for decades to come.\n“For the first time, we have integrated crucial battery storage in our efforts to make the Boyne aluminium smelter globally cost-competitive, as traditional energy sources become more expensive.\n“We continue to investigate further renewable energy investments to repower our Gladstone aluminium operations.”\nEdify Energy Chief Executive, John Cole, acknowledged the importance of this new services agreement in providing clean, reliable and cost-effective electricity to energy consumers.\n“The Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations deliver the latest in solar, battery and inverter technology to support Australia’s power needs.\n“This collaboration is an important commitment to supporting the sustainable future of Australia's industrial sector. We are proud to advance Rio Tinto's goals to repower its Gladstone operations and to play a role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.”\nWhen combined with the 2.2GW of renewable wind and solar PPAs Rio Tinto announced for its Gladstone operations in 2024, the Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap agreements help secure a total of 2.7GW 2 of future wind and solar energy in Queensland.\nTogether, the four contracted projects are expected to supply 80% of Boyne smelter’s annual average electricity demand, reducing the smelter’s scope 1 and 2 emissions by 70% 3 , or 5.6Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. This is the equivalent of removing about 2 million internal combustion engine cars from the road.\nRio Tinto's 90% share of the Smoky Creek & Guthrie's Gap battery system capacity amounts to 2,160MWh, which will provide about 30% of the firming required to repower the Boyne smelter with renewable energy. It will store green energy for reliable use during peak demand periods or low solar output, which will improve stability and resilience of Queensland’s power network.\nRio Tinto's integrated aluminium production chain in Queensland is a significant economic driver for the state and Australia, directly employing over 4500 people and supporting thousands more livelihoods. The company's operations in Gladstone alone account for more than 3000 jobs, with 1000 of those at the Boyne smelter.\nRio Tinto’s three production assets in the Gladstone region are the Boyne aluminium smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland alumina refinery.\nFurther information on the Smoky Creek & Guthrie's Gap Power Station is available here .\n1 The solar farm will have 720MWp (megawatt peak) of installed solar panels – the theoretical maximum potential output– and will deliver 600MWac (megawatts alternating current) of usable power to the grid.\n2 This comprises of the following contracted renewable energy projects: 1.1GW of Windlab’s proposed 1.4GW Bungaban wind project, 1.1GW from European Energy’s proposed Upper Calliope solar farm and 540MW from Edify Energy’s combined 600MW Smoky Creek & Guthrie’s Gap Solar Power Stations.\n3 5.6Mt CO2e and 70% reduction are on a 100% managed basis.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312396623/en/",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) 'It’s been rough': Bedford resident looks for help following summer flooding Marguerite Dodge’s Bedford, N.S., home has been uninhabitable since the summer floods hit back in late July. Every couple of days she checks on her house, a visit Dodge says she dreads. “Everything is totally disgusting,” she says. The night the Sackville River broke its' banks during torrential rains, Dodge was watching television in her home with her mother-in-law. They heard a noise and thought someone was breaking into the basement; it was the water pouring in through a window. “It was up to that first landing,” she says, pointing to an area just inside the front door of the split-level home. Dodge says it was also too high in her front yard for them to get out. “We were stuck here overnight. Kept calling 911 all night because I was scared of getting electrocuted because the lights were still on, but finally they blew,” she says. “They brought a boat the next morning and got us out by dinghy and took us to a shelter.” Dodge hasn't slept in her own bed since. “It’s been rough. I’m still paying mortgage here so I can’t rent anywhere, I can’t buy anything, I can’t sell this house. They’ve cancelled my insurance, so if anything happens to this, I’m in a bad situation,” she says. With her savings running out, Dodge says she needs help. “I would like the government to step up and buy these houses or at least mine and if the rest don’t want to sell, that’s totally up to them,” she says. Dodge says moving from a place she's called home for nearly 15 years would be a tough decision. “My husband and I bought it together and then he passed away,” she says. [The province has said](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/houston-government-would-consider-buying-flood-damaged-homes-if-hrm-makes-proposal-1.6552458) in order to consider buying homes on the floodplain in Bedford, the Halifax Regional Municipality would have to make a request.
