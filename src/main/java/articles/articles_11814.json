    "title": "Pritzker criticizes Chicago City Council's Gaza ceasefire resolution: 'I was disappointed'",
    "text": "Illinois Governor JB Pritzker on Thursday criticized the symbolic ceasefire resolution between Israel and Hamas passed by Chicago &apos;s City Council the day before.The governor expressed concern that the resolution does not hold Hamas accountable for their actions and highlighted the omission of acknowledging crimes committed by the group.\"I was disappointed that no consideration was given to the women who were raped by Hamas, fighters that crossed over into Israel kidnapped people, the deaths that were caused by those terrorists were not acknowledged, and honestly that the City Council, if they’re going to talk about the challenge of war in the Middle East, you got to make sure you include all of the perspectives. They did not do that,\" Pritzker said.Governor Pritzker added that he doesn&apos;t believe this resolution will have any impact on foreign policy or the ongoing situation in the Middle East. The resolution faced opposition from Alderwoman Debra Silverstein, who described it as lopsided, but it passed by a single vote, thanks to Mayor Brandon Johnson.The U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN) notes that Chicago is now the largest city in the country to pass a ceasefire resolution. Titled \"Uniting for Peace,\" the resolution, introduced by Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st) and Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez (33rd), is modeled after one put forth by the United Nations General Assembly last month.In addition to calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, the resolution seeks \"the unconditional release of all hostages and ensuring humanitarian access.\"The Jewish community has expressed concern about the potential exacerbation of recent anti-Semitic incidents following the City Council&apos;s vote. Yinam Cohen, Consul General of Israel to the Midwest, reported hearing anti-Semitic slurs during the City Council meeting and voiced concern about a potential rise in such incidents.Cohen expressed disappointment in Mayor Johnson, who cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the resolution.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Stocks Beat Blue-Chips In Trading Volumes, Analyst Says Miners To Peak As BTC Rallies - Benzinga",
    "text": " Bitcoin miner stocks have witnessed a significant rally in trading volumes compared to blue-chip stocks on the exchange amidst the rise in traders’ interest in Bitcoin.\nWhat Happened: Based on data, Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA reported a trading volume of 98 million at the time of writing compared to 81.3 million of Tesla Inc TSLA , Apple Inc AAPL at 19.9 million and Nio Inc - ADR NIO with 71.5 million. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN , Meta Platforms Inc. META and Palantir Technologies PLTR reported 16.5 million, 7.2 million, and 28.1 million, respectively.\nAmong the other Bitcoin miners, TerraWulf Inc WULF reported 49.4 million, Riot Platforms Inc RIOT stood at 36.7 million followed by Bitfarms Ltd BITF at 29.5 million, CleanSpark Inc CLSK at 20.2 million and Bit Digital Inc BTBT at 18.6 million.\nMike Alfred, an engaged value investor, took to X and said , \"Heavy algo activity after hours in the select group of miners I watch outside regular market hours. Every time I've seen this recently, it's had a perfect record calling a big move up the following day. The big squeeze is already on but we may see even more participation tomorrow\"\nBitcoin mining companies are looking to expand operations on the heels of a likely spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the scheduled Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.\nWhy It Matters: Marathon Digital announced purchasing new mining sites for $178.6 million adding 390 MW capacity. This will reduce the cost per coin mined by around 30%.\nTerraWulf today reported a fully funded 7.9 EH/s expansion, increasing self-mining capacity by 58%. It also highlighted future expansion plans which are likely to bring total operational capacity to ~10 EH/s.\nBit Digital announced to target the doubling of its operating fleet in its Bitcoin mining operations, to around 6.0 EH/s, during 2024. Bitfarms is expected to receive delivery of 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners in 1H24. It has the option to acquire an additional 28,000 Bitmain T21 miners. These expansions could take the company’s operational capacity to 17 EH/s during 2H24.\nBased on data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin miners’ revenue as of Dec. 28 stood at $46.8 million, the highest in 2023. The revenue has not reached that level since March 2022.\nCrypto quant trader Charles Edwards went on X on Dec. 27, writing , “Bitcoin miners are absolutely printing. With Miner Price at $64K, they are making 50% extra on top of the Bitcoin price.”\nAnother user, cycle forecaster and chartist MortensenBach said , “Bears keep telling me that the miners won’t reach ATH due to share dilution. Let me tell you, when Bitcoin is trading at 100,000-150,000, many of the miners will definitely be at ATH. As an example; In the last bull run $MARA gained 2,500% in 4.5 months from Nov 2020 to March 2021!”\nRead Next: Tired Of Shady Stablecoins?

    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | Salisbury Journal",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.

    "text": "Mundo\nEl Papa Francisco pasó una noche “tranquila”, pero su estado de salud sigue siendo “crítico”\nEl pontífice se pronunció en medio de su hospitalización y argumentó que sigue con confianza en su recuperación.\nPor: Redacción El País\nEste domingo, el Vaticano dio su más reciente reporte sobre el estado de salud del Papa Francisco, pasó la noche del sábado tranquila, lo que le permitió reposar bien, tras haber tenido una crisis respiratoria que requirió la administración de oxígeno de alto flujo. A pesar de esto, su estado de salud sigue siendo crítico y su pronóstico, es reservado.\nSegún el comunicado de la Santa Sede, a pesar de esta mejoría, la entidad reporta que su salud ha empeorado en los últimos días. Tras unos análisis de sangre realizados al pontífice, estos revelaron que padece una trombocitopenia, asociada a la anemia, lo que hizo necesaria una transfusión de sangre.\nAdemás, la institución católica expone que ante la crisis respiratoria prolongada que ha padecido estos días por la bronquitis asmática crónica y la neumonía bilateral, el santo padre tuvo que ser conectado a una bomba de oxígeno.\nFrancisco, de 88 años, fue hospitalizado el pasado 14 de febrero en el hospital Gemelli de Roma debido a una bronquitis que posteriormente evolucionó a neumonía bilateral. Desde entonces, ha permanecido bajo estricta vigilancia médica y recibiendo tratamientos con antibióticos y terapias respiratorias.\nPor segunda semana consecutiva, el papa Francisco no pudo rezar el Ángelus este domingo\nEl Obispo afirmó en medio de su hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli: “continúo con confianza”, siguiendo los tratamientos necesarios. “El descanso también forma parte de la terapia”, afirmó el pontífice en el mensaje que tenía previsto para el rezo del Ángelus de este domingo.\nEl sumo pontífice también aprovechó para agradecer a los médicos y al personal del hospital por la atención recibida. “Agradezco de corazón a los médicos y al personal sanitario de este hospital por la atención que me están demostrando y por la dedicación con la que realizan su servicio entre las personas enfermas”, agregó.\nEn su mensaje, Francisco manifestó su gratitud por el apoyo recibido por parte de los fieles en todo el mundo. “En estos días me han llegado muchos mensajes de afecto y me han impresionado especialmente las cartas y dibujos de los niños. ¡Gracias por esta cercanía y por las oraciones de conforto que he recibido de todo el mundo! Encomiendo a todos a la intercesión de María y les pido que recen por mí”, concluyó.\nEn la Misa de esta mañana, alzaron oraciones en torno al Papa Francisco\nEn la mañana de este domingo 23 de febrero, en la Misa del Jubileo de los diáconos, el pro-prefecto del Dicasterio para la Evangelización, el padre a cargo de la eucaristía, pidió oraciones por Francisco.\nEl Pontífice, Mons. Fisichella, resaltó la cercanía espiritual que tiene con el papa, por lo que incitó a la comunidad a intensificar las oraciones en aras de su recuperación: “Lo sentimos presente en medio de nosotros y esto nos obliga a hacer aún más fuerte e intensa nuestra oración para que el Señor le asista en su momento de prueba y enfermedad”, citó la Oficina de Prensa del Vaticano.\nRegístrate gratis al boletín diario de noticias El País\nTe puede gustar",

    "text": "Many flights to Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City were forced to circle in holding patterns before landing on Thursday due to adverse weather conditions, resulting in a chain of cascading delays for subsequent flights.\n“Flights to Ho Chi Minh City were delayed as aircraft were forced to circle before landing, causing a chain reaction of schedule disruptions for several other flights on December 12, both at noon and in the early afternoon,” national carrier Vietnam Airlines announced.\nPassengers also reported delays, including a flight from Chu Lai Airport in Quang nam Province, central Vietnam, to Tan Son Nhat, which had its take-off time pushed back.\nAccording to a source close to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, one of the key factors for the postponements was a sudden change in wind direction.\nThis prompted air traffic control to request a change in landing direction to ensure safety.\nFrom 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm, showers near the airport reduced visibility to 3,000-5,000 meters.\nAs flights neared the runway, sudden wind changes accompanied by increased intensity necessitated the landing direction shift.\nThe procedure was a standard safety measure in flight operations, both in Vietnam and worldwide, and did not pose a threat to flight safety.\n[Like us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/newsaboutvietnam/) or [follow us on X](https://x.com/VietNewsGateway) to get the latest news about Vietnam!",

    "text": "Loyola Chicago Suffers 3-0 Loss to Wisconsin Despite Strong Play\nThe\nLoyola Chicago women's soccer team demonstrated strong play for the first 80 minutes against Wisconsin but ultimately fell 3-0 after a barrage of three goals in just five minutes during the second half. Head coach Angela Staveskie praised her team's first-half performance but noted a decline in composure as the game progressed. The loss brings Loyola's record to 2-1-1 after an impressive start to the season.\n- Allison Deardorff recorded four saves, matching her season and career-high.\n- This was Loyola's first shutout loss of the 2024 season.\n- The Ramblers dominated the first half, creating numerous scoring opportunities.\n- In the second half, despite early chances, the team allowed three goals in rapid succession.\nLoyola Chicago will look to rebound as they host Bowling Green on Sunday, September 1, at 1 p.m. during their Alopecia Awareness match.Bottom Line\nThe Ramblers need to maintain their early-season momentum while learning from this loss to build resilience against tougher opponents.\nRead more at\n Loyola University Chicago Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
