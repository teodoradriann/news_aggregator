    "text": "La Cámara de Diputados aceptó las renuncias de Myriam Bregman y Romina del Plá por el Frente de Izquierda y de los Trabajadores, en el marco del inició de la sesión por la [Ley Bases](https://www.losandes.com.ar/temas/ley-bases/). Ya tomaron el juramento a sus reemplazantes Vanina Biasi y Mónica Schlotthauer, quienes completarán sus mandatos. La decisión obedece a una tradición de rotación de bancas que sostiene el Frente de Izquierda desde su formación, para que los distintos partidos políticos que componen la alianza tengan la oportunidad de ser protagonistas de la función parlamentaria. El jefe del bloque de Unión por la Patria, Germán Martínez, pidió un fuerte aplauso para Bregman y Del Plá, a quienes reconoció por su “destacada tarea” durante los años en que les tocó ser parte del cuerpo. Bregman, máxima referente del PTS, había encabezado la lista legislativa del FIT en 2021 por la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, seguida por Fernando Ramal (Partido Obrero). A la luz de la paridad de género, no es Ramal quien la reemplaza sino la tercera en la lista, Vanina Biasi (Partido Obrero). Biasi juró su banca “por el socialismo y la liberación de Palestina”, entre otras consignas. La nueva diputada es líder de la agrupación Bordó de no docentes de la UBA y dirigente del movimiento de mujeres y diversidades. En el caso de Del Plá (Partido Obrero), ella había ingresado en 2021 como segunda en la lista que encabezó Nicolás Del Caño (PTS). Tercera en esa nómina estaba Néstor Pitrola (Partido Obrero), pero fruto del criterio de paridad de género es Schlotthauer (Izquierda Socialista) quien releva a Del Plá. Representante de Izquierda Socialista, tiene 60 años de edad, y ya fue diputada nacional en dos cortos períodos entre 2019 y 2021. Fue delegada y parte de la dirección de ATSA en los 80, como así también luego sería delegada ferroviaria en la línea Sarmiento.",

    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) Madrid, Jan 19 (IANS) Atletico Madrid took revenge for last week's semifinal defeat in the Spanish Supercup, reaching the Copa del Rey quarterfinals with a 4-2 home win over Real Madrid.\nJust as in Saudi Arabia last week, the two teams produced another 120 monumental minutes of football, but this time goals in extra-time from Antoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme tilted the balance to Atletico's way in front of a packed Metropolitano Stadium on Thursday, reports Xinhua.\nThe first half was sandwiched by two completely different actions from Atletico keeper Jan Oblak, who in the 20th minute made a brilliant double save to deny Rodrygo and then Vinicius Jr as his teammates asked for offside.\nBefore that double save, Jude Bellingham was unlucky as Jose Gimenez did just enough to deflect his shot onto the crossbar.\nReal Madrid were looking more fluid and taking the game to their neighbors, who were leaving too much space between lines.\nRodrygo saw a free kick deflected over after a foul on Jude Bellingham and Fede Valverde hit a powerful shot at Oblak, before Atletico opened the scoring in the 38th minute.\nRodrigo de Paul found room to cross and his ball took a deflection off Antonio Rudiger for Lino to score at the far post.\nThings got heated and Vinicius, who was again been the target of racist insults from a section of the Atletico fans, was booked for complaining a refereeing decision, before a rare Oblak error gifted Real Madrid an equalizer in first half injury time.\nLuka Modric swung in a diagonal free kick and the keeper came a long way off his line, but his punch sent the ball into his own net.\nTen minutes into the second half, it was Andriy Lunin's turn to look bad as he could only palm a deflection off Eduardo Camavinga into the path of Alvaro Morata, although Rudiger should have done a better job of protecting him.\nRodrygo then saw a shot blocked onto the post by Lino, before Lunin made two vital blocks, first to deny Griezmann from a narrow angle and then Morata, who looked certain to score from Marcos Llorente's cross following an Atletico counter-attack.\nLunin's second save was vital as Real Madrid equalized in their next attack, with Vinicius passing to Bellingham, who crossed for Joselu to score a simple header minutes after getting into the game.\nIn the extra time, Griezmann restored Atletico's lead in the 100th minute with a brilliant individual goal, taking advantage of a poor control from Vinicius to run down the right touchline, before cutting inside and firing into the roof of the net from a tight angle.\nThe second period of extra time saw two tired teams giving everything. Dani Ceballos had the ball in the net but it was ruled out for a Bellingham offside.\nWith Real Madrid searching for an equalizer, Atletico caught them on the break and Riquelme assured their place in the last-eight after finishing off a move started by Griezmann and with Memphis Depay giving the final pass.\n--IANS\nbc/\nMENAFN18012024000231011071ID1107741037\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "Tonight, on RTÉ’s Prime Time, significant breaches of trust uncovered at Peter McVerry Trust – About RTÉ",
    "text": "Tonight, on RTÉ’s Prime Time, significant breaches of trust uncovered at Peter McVerry Trust [RTÉ](https://about.rte.ie/author/neilogorman/) [Media Centre](https://about.rte.ie/./media-centre/) Prime Time’s report tonight examines the failures of the Charities Regulator to address public concerns, focusing on issues within the Peter McVerry Trust, repeated crises at the former Kerry-based Animal Heaven Animal Rescue, and the now-defunct Cat Haven charity in Cork. The report examines internal documents seen by RTÉ’s Prime Time from the Peter McVerry Trust revealing significant breaches of trust in the use of donated money. The charity is currently under investigation by both the Charities Regulator and the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority. Internal documents from the Trust indicate that over a six-year period, up to €40 million in restricted donations, designated for specific purposes, were diverted for other purposes, including to cover debts or other spending by the charity. In September 2022, the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People charity donated €4.73 million to the McVerry Trust. The donation came with strict conditions dictating how it was to be spent. Those conditions were outlined in a 25-page legal agreement between the Peter McVerry Trust and the Capuchin Day Centre. Specifically, €1.6 million of the donation was earmarked to buy a large named property in north Dublin for housing unaccompanied minors fleeing war in Ukraine. However, just two weeks after signing the agreement in October 2022, the then CEO of the Peter McVerry Trust emailed the then head of finance instructing that €1.6 million be transferred from the Capuchin Restricted Capital Account to the Capital Development Account. An internal finance report reveals that over €1.3 million of the Capuchin donation was immediately used to pay running costs and charity debts, including over €700,000 owed to the Revenue Commissioners and €500,000 to two other creditors of the McVerry Trust. “This was a betrayal of trust,” said Jillian van Turnhout, a Chartered Director Certified in Corporate Governance. “The Capuchins had given the money for a very specific purpose. It was explicit,” To see an email that “violates that agreement in such a short space of time and such a clear manner, it makes me question, where were the controls in place in an organisation that one person could instruct in that way?” Additional discrepancies include €1.2 million donated to purchase three properties for homeless families and €1.5 million for a large North Dublin facility to support homeless individuals with chronic health issues, both of which were not used as intended. Moreover, €350,000 of the Capuchin money was transferred to NDP Counselling and Psychotherapy, a non-profit organisation with no commercial or service link to the McVerry Trust. It is unclear why such a large sum of money was transferred to NDP as it did not provide services to the Peter McVerry Trust. Speaking about this David Hall, businessman and charity campaigner said, “There was no commercial link, there was no service link, in relation to the Peter McVerry Trust and this other counselling service.” Only 9% of the Capuchin donation, or €430,000, was used as specified, according to a document from September 2023. The legal agreement with the Capuchins allows them to demand repayment if the donation is not used as agreed. The Peter McVerry Trust declined to comment on questions from Prime Time but stated it continues to cooperate with regulatory investigations and remains committed to supporting approximately 3,000 individuals, families, and children weekly.

    "title": "UK Social Media Manager Side Hustle: Video Training Course For Beginners Updated | FinancialContent Business Page",
    "text": "Video On Demand Courses has updated its training course on how to become a social media consultant in 2024.\nWingham, United Kingdom - October 17, 2024 —\nThe newly updated video course includes strategies, case studies, and training materials for beginners looking to start a social media consultancy business as a new career or a side hustle.\nTo find out more, visit https://www.videoondemandcourses.co.uk/opt-in-c0a30ec1-613e-495f-8bf2-0449e6205dae\nThe materials in the course focus on the early stages of building and marketing a social media consulting service, particularly how to select a niche and platform to operate on. As the instructors explain, the market for freelance content creators has never been larger, and their tips are designed to help those interested get a foothold in the industry.\nThe course arrives at a time when the majority - approximately 50% - of surveyed UK residents report relying on a side hustle of some kind to supplement their income. Of that group, 75% said that they were selling online or relying otherwise on digital infrastructure as the foundation of their business. Notably, almost all respondents said they would prefer to rely on their side hustle as a full-time source of income.\nSocial media consulting is an ideal side hustle given that most businesses require digital branding services, and social media marketing can be a more affordable alternative to PPC ad placements. There is a high demand for these services at the moment, with TikTok testimonials growing increasingly popular among small businesses.\nThe course materials are delivered on a monthly basis, allowing participants time to follow the template and develop their business before the next phase begins. Each stage of the course consists of around 5 short videos which participants can watch at their leisure.\nA spokesperson explains further, “It doesn’t matter if you are a complete beginner and haven’t ventured much into social media yourself. Maybe you haven’t even got a Facebook page yet. With this step-by-step, detailed video training you could be ready to start within hours and have this working for you fully in a few short months.”\nThose who sign up for the course will also receive a number of bonus training materials, including guides and checklists for entrepreneurs just starting out in the industry. These bonus materials will be made available instantly upon signup, alongside the first monthly video course.\nInterested parties can learn more and sign up at https://www.videoondemandcourses.co.uk/how-to-become-a-social-media-consultant\nContact Info:\nName: Sally Nash\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: Video on Demand Courses\nAddress: 10 North Court Close, Wingham, Kent CT3 1BW, United Kingdom\nWebsite: https://www.videoondemandcourses.co.uk/how-to-become-a-social-media-consultant\nSource: PressCable\nRelease ID: 89143940\nIf you encounter any issues, discrepancies, or concerns regarding the content provided in this press release, or if there is a need for a press release takedown, we urge you to notify us without delay at error@releasecontact.com (it is important to note that this email is the authorized channel for such matters, sending multiple emails to multiple addresses does not necessarily help expedite your request).
