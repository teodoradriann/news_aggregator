    "text": "New Year’s Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up warm as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as the clock strikes midnight. The weather is expected to remain unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain throughout the last weekend of 2023. A yellow weather warning for wind covering parts of Wales and the east of England has been issued and will come into force between 11am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday. A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services, the Met Office said. A yellow weather warning for rain has been issued covering Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday, which may lead to flooding and transport disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain will also come into effect at 4am on Saturday for Northern Ireland, due to be in force until 11am the same day. The fresh warnings come on the heels of a gusty few days brought on by Storm Gerrit. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected on Friday. Thousands of properties in Ceredigion were without power on Thursday after lightning struck supplies in Wales. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm – Storm Hank – as a “deep area of low pressure” pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn “wet and windy” across the UK with a band of “intense rain” pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly “severe gales” in exposed spots. In a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see “significant snow”, with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds. “There’s a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we’ve seen over some recent days,” he said. Blustery and showery conditions are set to continue into Sunday, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK. The mercury is expected to drop on Sunday. Mr Burkill said: “As we look towards the end of the day on New Year’s Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight. “So perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn’t been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it’s going to feel close to freezing for many places. “So definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.” New Year’s Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the “central slice” of the UK most likely to have showery rain. “As we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it’d be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled – some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,” Mr Burkill said. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A “supercell thunderstorm” that moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged around 100 homes in Stalybridge, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspended or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.",

    "text": "Si chiama Pian d’Erba, ma di verde ne rimane ben poco se non ai margini dei laghi e se si andrà avanti con la cementificazione anche gli ultimi prati e i piccoli boschi urbani che ancora resistono, sono destinati a scomparire presto.\nL’allarme arriva ancora una volta dalle associazioni che in questi anni hanno chiesto di cancellare dal PGT le previsioni urbanistiche di edificazione anche tramite una raccolta di firme sottoscritta da centinaia di cittadini. Questa volta tocca all’ultimo prato che ancora resisteva in via Marconi, nella frazione di Arcellasco, dove a breve partirà un intervento edilizio per la costruzione di nuove palazzine residenziali e un altro parcheggio . Tutto ciò in uno dei Comuni più urbanizzati in provincia di Como , che già ha avuto il triste record di cementificazione.\n\"Accanto all’intervento immobiliare, l’attuale Giunta del sindaco Caprani ha pensato di utilizzare gli oneri di urbanizzazione per realizzare un nuovo parcheggio. Una scelta che si somma alle altre recenti decisioni della stessa Giunta, che si comporta come un disco rotto: sa solo pensare alle automobili e ai parcheggi, in una città già troppo cementificata e trafficata. In alternativa quei soldi degli oneri si potevano utilizzare per interventi a favore della mobilità pedonale, come ad esempio la realizzazione e sistemazione dei marciapiedi e la messa in sicurezza degli attraversamenti pedonali lungo le vicine via Adua e via Leopardi, quest’ultima già dimostratosi pericolosa per i pedoni - spiegano dal Circolo Ambiente Ilaria Alpi che in questi anni ha censito gli ultimi prati di Erba per chiedere di proteggerli - I nuovi parcheggi previsti in via Marconi si vanno ad aggiungere ad altri previsti in centro città. Sono infatti in fase di realizzazione i nuovi posteggi lungo la via Fiume, che hanno comportato il taglio di un albero d’alto fusto; altri parcheggi sono previsti in via Volta, che determineranno la cancellazione di un bel parco privato verde e il taglio di alberi di alto fusto, come ci hanno più volte segnalato alcuni cittadini residenti in zona, contrari come noi alla cancellazione di aree verdi e alberate per far posto alle automobili.\nFederico Magni",

    "title": "Starmer says ‘Britain belongs on world stage’ at end of first summit as PM | Express & Star",
    "text": "Starmer says ‘Britain belongs on world stage’ at end of first summit as PM At the Nato summit, Sir Keir Starmer said the allies had agreed to an ‘irreversible’ path to membership for Ukraine. Sir Keir Starmer declared the UK was back playing a leading role on the world stage at the conclusion of his first international summit as Prime Minister. Sir Keir said he would “reset” the UK’s relationship with Europe, “return to leadership” on climate change and “engage more deeply” with developing countries in the southern hemisphere. His comments came at the conclusion of Nato’s 75th anniversary summit in Washington, where the Prime Minister said the allies had united behind Ukraine and the idea that a Russian victory is “unthinkable”. The 32-strong alliance has put Ukraine on an “irreversible” path to full Nato membership and committed extra military aid. Sir Keir said: “Together with our allies today, we have reaffirmed our unshakeable support for Ukraine’s ultimate victory. “Our determination – to deliver justice for the awful crimes that Russia has committed. “You will have all seen the scenes this week in Kyiv, Russia using some of the deadliest weapons in its arsenal on innocent children. Striking a hospital. “The alternative to Ukraine’s victory is unthinkable.” It would be an “affront to our values” and give “a green light to aggressors everywhere”, he warned. Sir Keir has committed to provide £3 billion of military aid to Ukraine every year “for as long as it takes”. At the Washington summit, the alliance as a whole promised a 40 billion dollar (£31 billion) annual support package, a new body to coordinate that help and measures to ramp up the industrial production of military equipment. Sir Keir said the allies “confirmed Ukraine’s irreversible path to full Nato membership”. The gathering in Washington was Sir Keir’s debut on the international stage, and his decision to highlight efforts to repair relations with Europe and put the fight against climate change at the heart of his diplomatic policy served to underline the break from his predecessor Rishi Sunak. Sir Keir said: “Britain belongs on the world stage. “So I am determined to reset our relationship with Europe, return to leadership on climate change and engage more deeply with the global south.” He said he was “determined to renew Britain’s place on the world stage”. He added that he was “proud of what we have to offer, confident, not just in the value of our strength, but in the strength of our values”. The summit came “in a new and dangerous era” for the world, defined by “volatility and insecurity”, he said, adding that Vladimir Putin’s Russia poses a “generational threat”, supported by North Korea and Iran, while conflicts rage across the Middle East and Africa. He also highlighted the “challenge” of China, terrorism and the undermining of international institutions.",

    "text": "Mike Wright Leads Northwestern to Victory in First Start as QB\nMike Wright's debut as\nNorthwestern's quarterback resulted in a close 13-6 victory over Miami Ohio, showcasing his potential despite some areas needing improvement. Having transferred from Mississippi State, Wright completed 60% of his passes, added 65 rushing yards, and demonstrated a knack for making crucial throws in tight windows. The game highlighted Wright's effectiveness, though he didn’t find the end zone through the air. Overall, this inaugural performance leaves both promise and room for growth as the season unfolds.\n- 18-of-30 passing for 178 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions.\n- 9 carries for 65 yards and 1 rushing touchdown.\n- Averaged 5.9 yards per attempt with a 73.2 PFF offensive grade.\n- Wright adjusted well, delivering effective passes despite early inaccuracies.\n- Led the offense with a mix of passing and rushing, keeping defenses guessing.\nAs the season progresses, expect Wright to further develop his chemistry with the offense, potentially enhancing his passing effectiveness and decision-making under pressure. Increased use of designed runs and bootlegs could be explored to exploit his mobility.Bottom Line\nWright's initial showing offers hope for Northwestern's offense. While there were missed opportunities, his ability to adapt points to a promising trajectory. Continued improvement in execution will be key for sustaining success throughout the season.\nRead more at\n Inside NU\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "Leveraging Tech Innovations to Revolutionize Beauty e-Commerce\nPOMPANO BEACH, Fla. , April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In a world where technology and beauty are increasingly intersecting, eCosmetics stands as a prime example of how to leverage digital advancements and redefine the e-commerce landscape. This innovative platform is not just a beauty retailer; it's a tech-driven powerhouse transforming the way consumers discover, interact with, and purchase beauty products.\nA Tech-Driven Approach\nAt its core, eCosmetics is a testament to the power of technology in enhancing customer experiences and optimizing business operations. Co-founders Alex Irvin and Richard Kirsch , with their rich backgrounds in IT and marketing, integrated cutting-edge technology into every facet of their business model.\nThe eCosmetics website stands out with its user-friendly design, intuitive navigation, and personalized shopping experiences. A Statista insight report from 2024 notes 34 percent of US consumers will \"gladly pay for services that make life more convenient,\" and eCosmetics is aiming for shopping ease by employing advanced algorithms for product recommendations and leveraging AI for customer insights.\n\"When people come to our site, they know we already have all their favorite beauty brands and products,\" says Michelle Chase , eCosmetics' Director of Account Management. \"But we also want them to fall in love with something new they may not have found otherwise. Using AI and learning algorithms, we can ensure every customer experience is tailored to individual preferences and needs.\"\nBehind the scenes, eCosmetics' technological prowess is equally impressive. The company's sophisticated inventory management system, anchored in its South Florida distribution center, allows for efficient handling of thousands of products. This system ensures stock levels are optimized, orders are processed swiftly, and customers receive their purchases promptly – all key factors in building customer trust and loyalty.\nOther tech-driven efforts include the brand's new subscription service. When a customer knows they need consistent refills of their favorite hair or skincare, those go-to products can be sent automatically to their door without needing to place a new order each time.\nData-Driven Marketing\nUnder the leadership of Irvin, eCosmetics' marketing strategies are a blend of creativity and data-driven precision. By harnessing the power of big data, the company gains valuable insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and campaign performance.\nIn a 2023 Statista survey, nearly 58 percent of Millennials consumers and more than 40 percent of Gen X and Baby Boomers wanted personalized product recommendations while shopping online. The eCosmetics team is looking into its own intelligent virtual assistant or sales chatbot for simple customer inquiries as well as individualized recommendations. According to PwC, customers are willing to pay up to 16 percent more for similar services.\nThis data-centric approach enables eCosmetics to craft targeted marketing campaigns, optimize customer acquisition costs, and, ultimately, drive sales and revenue growth.\nFutureproofing Through Innovation\nLooking to the future, eCosmetics shows no signs of complacency. The company is exploring emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) for virtual product try-ons—a market projected to grow through 2028—and even blockchain technology for security and transparency. These forward-thinking initiatives keep eCosmetics ahead of the curve and signal the brand's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.\nA shining example of how technology can be harnessed to revolutionize an industry, eCosmetics blends the allure of beauty with the efficiency of technology. It's not just meeting the current demands of the e-commerce world; it's setting new standards for what's possible in online retail. As technology evolves, eCosmetics remains poised at the forefront, ready to embrace the next wave of digital innovations in the beauty industry.\nAbout eCosmetics\neCosmetics is a beauty and fashion online retailer based out of Pompano Beach, FL.

    "title": "'You can marry multiple times, but all wives must be treated equally': Madras HC cites Sharia law to dissolve marriage of Muslim man",
    "text": "On December 22, 2023, the Madra High Court upheld the annulment of a marriage, [holding](https://www.verdictum.in/court-updates/high-courts/muslim-husband-treat-all-wives-equally-per-islamic-law-madras-high-court-1512117) that while Islamic Law allows polygamy, equal treatment of all wives is essential and failing to do so amounts to cruelty. The bench comprising Justices Rmt. Teekaa Raman and Justice PB Balaji dismissed an appeal filed by the Husband against the Family Court’s judgement and order dissolving the marriage between the parties under Section 2(ii)(iv)(viii)(a)(d) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (Act). The Court stated that the wife convincingly demonstrated that the husband treated her unfairly in comparison to his second wife, refused to provide care and support, and neglected marital commitments after their separation while she lived with her parents. “Thereby, he has not treated the first wife and the second wife equally as required under the provisions of Islamic Law. Under Islamic Law, the husband is entitled for Polygamous marriage, however, he has to treat all the wife equally,” the court observed. Advocate K. Abiya appeared for the Appellant Mukmuthu Sha and Advocate C. Jeya Indira Patel appeared for the Respondent Afrin Banu. The first wife described harassment from her husband, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law, alleging neglect during pregnancy, food allergies, and cruelty following a miscarriage. “Without considering that the plaintiff is pregnant, the mother of the husband/defendant scolded her for not properly draping the saree, and the husband also took photos of the plaintiff and the defendant while they were intimate position.” A child was born to the parties when the plaintiff/wife went to Chennai to live with her husband in September 2016. However, the child died the following day. On that score, the husband’s sister “abused the wife by stating that she could solemnise another marriage of the defendant/husband since the plaintiff/wife has no child,” the wife alleged. She went on to accuse her spouse of unfair comparisons and emotional abuse, prompting her to leave the matrimonial home. While the husband denied these allegations, the court’s examination of the evidence proved his cruelty and neglect towards his first wife and failure to fulfil marital obligations to her. The ruling emphasised his lack of effort to support her while she was with her parents, which contributed to the dissolution ruling. The High Court upheld the Tirunelveli Family Court’s verdict, concluding that the husband’s unequal treatment and failure to support his first wife justified the couple’s separation. The Bench, thus, dismissed the husband’s appeal, upholding the initial decision.",

    "text": "Coventry homeowners and landlords can make their homes warmer, more comfortable and cheaper to heat through free or reduced-price energy saving measures as part of a Government scheme.\nThe City Council has secured £2.8m from the Government's Home Upgrade Grant (HUG) scheme to improve homes that are not connected to the mains gas grid.\nUpgrade measures include different types of insulation, air source heat pumps, solar panels, and building control technology. The aim is to help lower-income households across Coventry to save money and cut carbon emissions.\nE.ON,\nCoventry's Strategic Energy Partner, is the approved provider for the improvements, with the energy advice charity Act on Energy providing additional services.\nCllr Jim O'Boyle, cabinet member for jobs, regeneration and climate change, said, \"I'm really pleased that we have secured this funding and by contracting with our strategic energy partner we have spent less on the commissioning process which means even more cash will be available for home upgrades.\n\"We have enough in this grant to support everyone that qualifies with energy efficiency improvements. This will mean people can live in homes that are cheaper to heat and reduce their carbon footprint at the same time. It really is a win-win and I urge anyone that thinks they might qualify to get in touch with us to start the process.\"\n\"Tackling the heat wasted from our homes is a triple win for homeowners and tenants,\" said Chris Lovatt, Chief Operating Officer for Energy Infrastructure Solutions at E.ON UK. \"It reduces bills for the long term, makes our homes healthier places to live, and it's better for the planet.\n\"There's also the added benefit that improving homes at scale in places like Coventry creates jobs and skills for people in and around the city. All of these measures are key to our strategic energy partnership with Coventry City Council and about making the city cleaner and greener.\"\nBritish homes are among the least energy-efficient in Europe, with more than 19 million properties failing to meet a C grade in Energy Performance Certificate ratings. Latest data shows there are more than 3,000 homes in Coventry that have an EPC rating of D or below.\nFewer than half of Coventry's privately rented or owned homes achieved a C grade or better for their energy-efficiency rating, with just under half of all households in the city classed as living in fuel poverty for the purposes of HUG.\nHomeowners who qualify for the grant would be able to get upgrades for free, while eligible landlords would be able to install the same improvements with a two-thirds discount.\nTo qualify you must be a homeowner or a private rented tenant where:\n- Your home is not heated by mains gas (which includes oil, coal, LPG or only electric heating)\nAND\n- You have a combined annual income of less than £31,000\nOR you are receiving certain income-related means-tested benefits such as Universal Credit\nOR if you live in certain area – which will be checked automatically when you apply\n- You live in hard to heat homes – this is based on your home Energy Performance Certificate (E.ON will help with this and you could get a free assessment if you do not have one already)\nFunding will be available until March 2025 and the council will be contacting residents they believe could be eligible. You can find out more and apply at\ncoventry.gov.uk/hug or by calling Act on Energy on 0800 988 2881.",
