    "text": "Helicóptero de Ejército aterriza en medio de combates con disidencias - crédito Redes sociales La intensa ofensiva de las Fuerzas Militares contra las disidencias de las Farc, que no respetaron el cese al fuego bilateral y se apartaron de los diálogos con el Gobierno nacional, no deja de ser contundente, especialmente en la región comprendida como Cañón de Micay, en el Cauca, donde predomina la presencia de esa guerrilla.\nDe hecho, en la últimas horas se conoció un video de los combates entre los grupos armados en zona montañosa de Argelia (Cauca). En el clip de solo 57 segundos, se logra observar cómo un helicóptero del Ejército Nacional es recibido a bala por los disidentes. Enseguida, al menos seis uniformados se bajan de la aeronave en posición de contraataque disparando sus fusiles y arrastrándose para evitar ser impactados por los disparos del contendor.\nAhora puede seguirnos en nuestro WhatsApp Channel y en Facebook .\nEn video quedó registrado el ataque de las disidencias a helicóptero del Ejército - crédito EJÉRCITO DE COLOMBIA Según informó el Ejército, estos combates se habrían registrado hace aproximadamente ocho días, en dicha zona de influencia que está en la mira de la fuerza pública para ser retomada.\nAsí lo afirmó el comandante del Ejército, general Luis Emilio Cardozo, al explicar los principales retos para afrontar la ola terrorista que tiene asediada a esta población caucana. “Entre los retos que como comandante del Ejército Nacional me he trazado en el periodo que me corresponde, destaco la honestidad y la transparencia, que serán el norte del Ejército. No habrá espacio para quienes realicen actos de corrupción. En este tema, la contrainteligencia nuestra trabajará de la mano de todas las autoridades competentes, con el fin de que se dé inicio a las investigaciones a que haya lugar y se adopten las decisiones que en derecho correspondan”, afirmó Cardozo a El Nuevo Siglo .\nComandante del Ejército, general Luis Emilio Cardozo, expuso los principales retos para combatir los grupos armados que no se acogieron al proceso de paz Total - crédito Luisa Gonzalez/REUTERS El comandante del Ejército destacó el fortalecimiento de la inteligencia y la contrainteligencia como un complemento crucial combatir los grupos armados ilegales. “La inteligencia es la que permite anticiparse a las acciones de la amenaza y también es la que permite dar una dinámica operacional a las tropas. Por esta razón su fortalecimiento es fundamental”, anotó.\nEn la entrevista, conocida el 10 de agosto, el comandante Cardozo enfatizó en que el suministro de la artillería hace parte de la base para ejecutar las ofensivas contra grupos armados. “Hay una dinámica operacional focalizada en algunos sitios bien complicados de la geografía nacional, como el Cauca, el sur de Bolívar, Arauca, el Bajo Cauca, Nariño, y allí es necesario desplegar medios adicionales a los que normalmente están . Un ejemplo de esto es el desplazamiento en esas áreas críticas de obuses 155, de 105 milímetros de morteros. Es un ejemplo de ese fortalecimiento que estamos haciendo, reposicionando la artillería para facilitarle a las tropas su avance y poder cubrirla con fuego”, sostuvo al medio reseñado.\nPor último, indicó que recuperar la moral de las tropas, especialmente de los primeros mandos a nivel regional, es uno de los objetivos con el que se busca fortalecer en la institución.\nComunidades campesinas en medio de combates entre Ejército y disidencias Cabe recordar que, el lunes 19 de agosto, comunidades campesinas del corregimiento El Plateado, en Argelia, elevaron un llamado al Gobierno nacional, expresando la difícil situación que viven por cuenta de los combates entre el Ejército nacional y el frente Carlos Patiño de las disidencias de las Farc.\n“ Mucho miedo por esas balaceras, las cuales se forma de un momento a otro entras las viviendas de los pobladores, quienes no tienen nada que ver en esa pelea , los más perjudicados son los niños, porque se asustan mucho al escuchar esos estruendos”, dijo uno de los habitantes del territorio, citado por La Fm.\nEl Plateado se ha convertido en escenario de combates entre grupos armados - crédito ilustrativa Infobae / Cauca Noticias Radio y TV/ Facebook Líderes agregaron que resulta urgente que se “agilicen” los programas e inversión social que se está llevandon a cabo en el municipio, pues afirman que necesitan que el corregimiento deje ser escenario de violencia. “Que el Gobierno se ponga pilas a la hora de materializar todos esos programas que ahora pusieron en marcha acá en esta zona, para ir ganándole terreno a los grupos armados al margen de la ley y que el corregimiento de El Plateado por fin pueda vivir en paz”",

    "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. (KMTV — It’s no secret that many members of the Unicameral aren’t happy with how Gov. Jim Pillen has handled the run up to this special session and those frustrations continue to grow as the session rolls on. “That’s what we are seeing here today, a lot of emotion and no facts…” said Sen. Lou Ann Linehan. The most recent drama has centered around a bill introduced earlier this session by Sen. Jana Hughes that first began to boil over on Wednesday. Her bill, LB9, looked to introduce new school levy caps gradually over the next decade. But the revenue committee, headed by strong Pillen ally Linehan, has introduced an amendment to speed up that process and cut levies from $1.05 to $.25 cents, starting in fiscal year 2025 and 2026. A move that drew the ire of some senators who were involved in introducing the bill. “The revenue comittee has agreed that the governor’s plan is too toxic and has collapsed under its own weight because its poor policy. And are now seeking to hijack other bills,” said Sen. Danielle Conrad. The governor and his allies, however, aren’t taking the criticism sitting down. Senators supportive of Pillen’s plan hit back at opponents arguing they aren’t debating in good faith and are only trying to stall the process. Linehan also reminded her colleagues that bills being amended and changing isn’t unusual. “That's the way the process works here. All of a sudden it’s 'oh, you have a bill and you are changing a bill.' But that’s exactly the way the process has worked for, I suppose, decades,” said Linehan. Pillen himself stepped into the fray on Thursday after he released a statement chiding lawmakers for what he called “baseless personal attacks” in pursuit of festering political grievances. It's clear from the back and forth that things are likely to get even more heated as the debates on these bills get underway as the body balances how much they want input from the governor and his team and their independence as a separate branch of government. “I think our governor is used to walking into a board room, telling people to get stuff done and walking out expecting to get stuff done and that is not how government works,” said Sen. Carol Blood.",

    "title": "No longer Jihadistan - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "AS troubled Pakistan enters 2024 let’s first hear the good news: no longer do armed militant groups gather on every street corner or ride double-cabin pickups with weapons in hand. It wasn’t always so. In fact, 25-30 years ago, there were so many groups that remembering all their names wasn’t easy. Jihad-i-Kashmir and Jihad-i-Afghanistan banners, posters, and songs were everywhere. Today, although the official website of the Pakistan Army still displays the Ziaul Haq era motto ‘Imaan, Taqwa, Jihad’, army recruiting centres no longer exhibit oversized banners bearing ‘Jihad Fi-Sabeelillah’ (jihad for Allah). The path towards the present has been long and there’s much shyness about discussing the past. Absence of public discussion means that few people understand what changed, how, and when. While many welcome downplaying jihad, others feel this was imposed on Pakistan by external actors and some dream of reversing it. No single event turned the tide but the [APS massacre of 2014](https://www.dawn.com/news/1151361), executed by TTP as part of its putative jihad, was significant. Every day, more reason is being added by its murderous assaults on Pakistan’s security forces. This year [23 soldiers lost their lives in a single gruesome suicide attack](https://www.dawn.com/news/1797238) by those seeking Taliban-style rule in Pakistan. Still bigger attacks had happened earlier (Peshawar mosque, 2021). Pakistan routinely blames India but the problem is Kabul. Pakistan has reached out to Afghanistan’s new leaders repeatedly, hoping to build a protective ideological fence. Since TTP sees this as a religious war, Pakistan demands a fatwa declaring attacks on Pakistani forces as haram. But the Taliban government has balked at this. Visits by two foreign ministers, an ISI chief, and many high-level Deobandi clerics — Maulana Taqi Usmani included — achieved little. Whether Maulana Fazlur Rahman’s charm offensive will succeed remains to be seen. It seems like only yesterday when Blackwater and India, aided and abetted by Hamid Karzai and then Ashraf Ghani, were decried as the founts of terrorism. And so, when the Taliban finally triumphed in 2021, Pakistan’s military and political class was euphoric. The Afghan jihad had succeeded — India had been booted out and American plans for an orderly withdrawal had been thwarted. Experiments with cross-border jihad are thankfully over but nationalists are still being tyrannised. Who can forget the celebrations after the fall of Kabul and then prime minister Imran Khan’s ecstatic “ [breaking the chains of slavery](https://www.dawn.com/news/1640988)”? The Urdu press and TV channels were thrilled. ‘Our boys’ — many trained in Pakistani madressahs — had won. The cherished goal of strategic depth had finally been reached. But within months, the euphoria turned into sulking gloominess. Those who brought disaster to our doorstep will not talk about it. Therefore, it is all the more important to keep reminding ourselves of just how and why it all happened. That story must start in 1987 with the failed cross-LOC experiment. Delhi’s unconscionable manipulation of Kashmiri politics caused a popular uprising against Indian occupation. Kashmiris fled Indian repression by the thousands and crossed into Pakistan’s side of the LOC. Thereupon Pakistan’s planners hit upon the bleed-India-with-a-thousand-cuts strategy accompanied by flat denials of involvement. This seemed an ideal low-cost option for eventual victory, a means to change an otherwise unchangeable stalemate. India’s wrongdoing became an excuse for creating a militarised Pakistani security state that, for selfish institutional reasons, sought to keep Kashmir boiling forever. Fortuitously, the Soviet-Afghan war had just ended leaving behind a surplus of battle-hardened fighters hungry for new challenges. Militants such as Hafiz Saeed’s LeT and Masood Azhar’s JeM were seen as well-suited for the task. Others, such as Sipah-i-Sahabaand Lashkar-i-Omar, were sectarian and aimed against Baloch nationalists. Yet others — the most important being TTP — were unintended by-products. By 2002, there were already enough jihadist groups in Pakistan to warrant a guidebook. Through their public rallies and donation boxes in markets and shops, they made their presence and identities fully known. Pakistan had become a magnet for fighters everywhere from Europe to the Middle East and Central Asia to Indonesia. The period between 2002 and 2014 was marked by increasing ambiguity, duplicity and cross-killings. With multiple centres of power, the empire of holy war became an unholy mess. Who was killing who and for what end? Politicians and senior army commanders cut their own private deals with jihadist groups. In 2010, then chief minister Shehbaz Sharif, through his contacts in Al-Qaida, proposed that normal relations be established with TTP as quid pro quo for sparing Punjab from terrorist attacks. By one estimate, between 2001 and 2013 about 49,000 Pakistani citizens, police, and soldiers had been killed. The fervour for jihad began to fade. Fear of being blacklisted by FATF and diplomatic isolation led to Hafiz Saeed, a jihad icon and LeT’s founder, being steadily downgraded. He was eventually sentenced to two prison terms each of five and a half years. Like uncounted others, he was no more than a cheap, disposable tool. The Kashmir experiment eventually sputtered to a halt. On Oct 5, 2019, [then prime minister Imran Khan tweeted](https://www.dawn.com/news/1509140) that “anyone crossing the LoC from AJK to provide humanitarian aid or support for Kashmiri struggle will play into the hands of the Indian narrative”. What good the cross-border experiment did — other than leave thousands dead on all sides and isolate Pakistan diplomatically — must be asked of those who imagined and organised the Kashmir jihad. Wresting Kashmir from Indian rule has become doubly difficult today. Fortunately, Pakistan has moved up the learning curve. Fruitless negotiations with TTP have rightly been abandoned and terrorists are being confronted with force. But Pakistan’s Punjab-centric leaders have learned nothing about how to handle outstanding national grievances. A recent example is the extrajudicial murder of Balach Baloch, one which has led to mass protests across Pakistan. The establishment’s present attitude towards nationalists must change. Just as it was sensible to abandon cross border jihad, it makes sense to abandon the failed hard-fist approach. To harass and arrest PTM leaders (who are strongly anti-Taliban), or to abduct peacefully protesting Baloch youth, defies all reason. Dealing with Pakistan’s estranged nationalists needs political sagacity and a willingness to accept them as equal citizens of Pakistan who have been wronged. Else, be prepared for unending militancy and a miserable 2024. The writer is an Islamabad-based physicist and author. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2023",

Este 1 de noviembre, el Ministerio de Salud (Minsal) anunció un importante avance en la protección de la salud infantil: la incorporación de la dosis de refuerzo de la vacuna [meningocócica recombinante ](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/08/22/meningitis-en-chile-cuales-son-los-sintomas-y-como-se-contagia-la-enfermedad-alertada-por-el-ministerio-de-salud/)serogrupo B al Programa Nacional de Inmunizaciones (PNI). La subsecretaria de Salud Pública, Andrea Albagli, destacó la importancia de esta nueva dosis de refuerzo, la cual ayudará a prevenir infecciones graves y posibles hospitalizaciones provocadas por la bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. [Es un santuario de la naturaleza y abarca 11 mil hectáreas: el humedal a una hora de Santiago, ideal para visitar por el día](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/11/07/es-un-santuario-de-la-naturaleza-y-abarca-11-mil-hectareas-el-humedal-a-una-hora-de-santiago-ideal-para-visitar-por-el-dia/) Esta bacteria es responsable de la enfermedad meningocócica, que puede ser mortal. El objetivo del Minsal es lograr una cobertura del 90% de la población objetivo antes de que termine el año. Además, esta dosis de refuerzo se podrá administrar gratuitamente en todos los vacunatorios públicos y privados. ¿Quiénes son las personas que deben inocularse? La nueva dosis de refuerzo de la vacuna meningocócica recombinante serogrupo B está dirigida a los lactantes de 18 meses que ya hayan recibido su esquema primario, es decir, las dos dosis iniciales administradas a los 2 y 4 meses de edad. Esta vacuna es gratuita y está disponible en [todos los vacunatorios públicos y privados](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/08/21/alerta-epidemiologica-nacional-por-aumento-en-casos-de-meningitis-en-chile-minsal-descarta-brote-de-la-enfermedad/) en convenio con las seremis de salud, como parte del Programa Nacional de Inmunizaciones (PNI). Ampliación del esquema de vacunación Desde el 1 de julio de 2023, el Ministerio de Salud ya había extendido el esquema de la vacuna meningocócica recombinante para lactantes, incorporando las primeras dosis a los 2 y 4 meses para niños nacidos desde el 1 de mayo de 2023. Hasta el 4 de octubre, la cobertura de estas primeras dosis alcanzó un 98.5% para la primera aplicación, según datos del Registro Nacional de Inmunizaciones (RNI). Aunque la enfermedad meningocócica tiene baja incidencia en Chile, es altamente letal. Desde 2012, la incidencia ha sido de menos de 1 caso por cada 100.000 habitantes, pero su letalidad alcanzó un 31% en 2019. En 2023 se confirmaron 65 casos, mientras que hasta la semana epidemiológica 44 de 2024 se han registrado 79 casos, con una incidencia de 0,4.

    "text": "Mujer asegura que la dejaron por ser demasiado perfecta ESPAÑA.- Un conmovedor video puso en evidencia cómo una persona puede abandonar a otra inclusive si es, aparentemente, muy “perfecta”. Las relaciones sentimentales pueden variar según las personas involucradas; sin embargo, existen ciertos elementos que, a menudo, suelen ser fundamentales, como la comunicación abierta; confianza, respeto, apoyo, tiempo de calidad, intimidad, hasta los objetivos comunes o resolución de conflictos Con esto en mente, a través de Tiktok, en la cuenta de ByLuigi (@byluigix1) compartió qué es lo que más la ha marcado; la mujer puntualizó cómo la dejaron. La mujer hace hincapié en cómo mientras conocía a alguien, que pensó que era alguien serio, fue capaz de apoyarle en todo, desde pagar los estudios, pagar el alquiler hasta las cenas y todo, sin embargo, de un día para otro, el hombre la dejó por “ser demasiado perfecta”. Finalmente, el creador de contenido le preguntó qué le diría si se lo volviese a encontrar; y la mujer, de inmediato, le pediría que le de razones por las cuales la dejó, pues quiere que le digan las cosas a la cara. El video, en menos de 24 horas llegó a más de 125 mil reproducciones en TikTok, con comentarios que decían cómo las mujeres las dejaban por ser ideales.",

    "title": "Brandi Glanville Details Feeling Possible Parasite 'Move Around' in Her Disfigured Face as She Makes First Public Outing This Month",
    "text": "By Stephanie Kaplan ,\n49 minutes ago Brandi Glanville admitted she's been in a 'deep depression' due to her health complications. @brandiglanville/instagram Brandi Glanville is doing everything she can to get back to normal after discovering a parasite may to be blame for her medical woes and facial disfiguration.\nIn a new interview, the reality star — who recently made her first public appearance of December — explained when she paused taking antibiotics, one side of her face began caving in.\nBrandi Glanville believes a parasite is to blame for her facial disfigurement. @brandiglanville/instagram \"I prefer [my face] when it’s a little swollen , to be honest. When it’s only swollen on one side, it’s not great. But the sinking in thing is killing me slowly, because I just feel like I look like a crackhead,\" she confessed.\n\"You could do anything you want to me, and I’d be OK with it,\" she said of trying to get healthy and improve her appearance. \"I’ve had days of looking normal, not weeks. I wish. But it comes and goes.\"\nThe reality star is getting treatments to try and fix her cheek that was 'sinking in.' @brandiglanville/instagram \"Whenever I get the chills, it’s generally an infection. Then I start having the ticking in my ear, and then whatever’s in my face, moving around, started moving around again,\" she spilled. \"And it starts sinking in again.\"\nGlanville — who said doctors \"don't know\" if the parasite is still present — is currently working with a plastic surgeon to fix the superficial aspect of the issue, as she thinks her appearance is freaking out her two sons.\n\"They would try and calm me down and say I look normal and fine, but I knew better. I honestly scared them a couple times,\" the Bravo star admitted. \"They were like, ‘What is happening? ’ [My face] went from being like really fat and swollen to now, like, sinking in.\"\nThe situation has also taken a toll on the mom-of-two's mental health, as she had been staying out of the spotlight.\nGlanville admitted she could feel something 'move around' in her face. mega \"It’s hard to hide out during Christmas when everyone’s having their parties. It’s depressing. It just hurts my brain and my heart. The pain is more mental than anything, because I have been hiding and going through a deep, deep depression ,\" Glanville revealed. \"Even if I could work now, at this point, I couldn’t. So it’s just been a really rough two years for me.\"\nThe mom-of-two made her first public appearance this month at a December 18 Christmas party. @brandiglanville/instagram Aside from healing her mug, Glanville also appears to be in better spirits mentally, as on Wednesday, December 18, she made an appearance at influencer Amouranth 's holiday party.\nThe outing reportedly marked the TV personality's first public appearance since disclosing her medical woes, and she looked as confident as ever while posing for photos.\nPage Six spoke with Glanville while In Touch Weekly reported on her attendance at the party.",

    "title": "Indian zoo forced to change lions’ ‘blasphemous’ names",
    "text": "An Indian zoo was ordered to change lions’ ‘blasphemous’ names after complaints from a hardline Hindu organisation. The pair of animals are named Sita, after a Hindu goddess, and Akbar, after a Mughal-era emperor. But a court in West Bengal ruled their names must be changed following complaints from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, which had argued calling one of the lion’s Sita had caused “great anguish”. The group also objected to plans to keep the five-year-old lioness in the same enclosure as Akbar, given the same title as the 16th-century Mughal emperor of India. The VHP is linked to Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government, which has been routinely accused by critics of promoting a pro-Hindu agenda and discrimination against India’s minority Muslim population. “You could have named it Bijli [lightning] or something like that. But why give names such as Akbar and Sita?” Justice Saugata Bhattacharya of the West Bengal High Court said during a hearing held on Thursday. He asked a lawyer representing West Bengal’s state government in the case whether he would name a pet of his own after a Hindu God or Muslim Prophet. “Why should you draw controversy by naming a lion after Sita and Akbar?” Justice Bhattacharya added, before directing officials to rename the creatures. The VHP said in its filing to the court that the naming of the lion as Sita amounted to a “direct assault on the religious beliefs of all Hindus”. “She is the consort of (Hindu God) Lord Ram and herself is a sacred deity to all Hindus across the world,” the group said. “Such an act amounts to blasphemy and is a direct assault on the religious beliefs of all Hindus.” The group added that it had received complaints from Hindus spread across India over the name and the plans to let the lioness live alongside Akbar. “Sita and Akbar cannot be allowed to live together,” VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said. West Bengal’s authorities said the animals were given their names by a previous zoo in Tripura, northeastern India, several years before the creatures were transferred to their new home.",
