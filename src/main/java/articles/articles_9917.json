    "text": "The Detroit Pistons shook off some frustrating losses with a 46-point blowout win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Now they look to keep the good times rolling against the struggling Miami Heat. The Heat are currently in the midst of an eight-game losing streak. That is not typical of the Erik Spoelstra Heat. They miss Jimmy Butler and the miss someone in the lineup who can be that gravitational force that the other Miami players can orbit around and discover a flow and rhythm within their offense. The Pistons have that in Cade Cunningham. Cade is still playing at an extremely high level, but his shooting has taken a dip lately. It’d be nice to see a few more 3-pointers fall and a nice, efficient night that allowed him to score his 25 points on 14 or fewer shots.\nGame Vitals\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. ET\nWhere: Kaseya Center, Miami, Florida\nWatch: ESPN\nOdds: Pistons -5\nProjected Lineups\nDetroit Pistons (38-31)\nCade Cunningham, Tim Hardaway Jr, Ausar Thompson, Tobias Harris, Jalen Duren\nMiami Heat (29-39)\nTyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Haywood Highsmith, Bam Adebayo",

They are results that live up to the ambition of Libyans to hold elections,\" Menfi told the media after the meeting.</p>.<p>Menfi came to power when the Government of National Unity (GNU) under Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah was installed through a UN-backed process in 2021, but the parliament no longer recognises its legitimacy.</p><p>Dbeibah has vowed not to cede power to a new government without national elections.</p><p>The House of Representatives was elected in 2014, while the High State Council was formed as part of a 2015 political agreement and drawn from a parliament elected in 2012.</p>.<p>Last week, Central Bank governor Sadiq Kabir wrote to parliament asking it to approve a new unified government and a national budget over GNU extent spending.</p><p>International diplomacy to resolve the conflict in Libya has focused on pushing for parliamentary and presidential elections to replace the interim political institutions, including the HoR, HSC and GNU.</p><p>While all major political players in the country have called for elections, many Libyans doubt they genuinely seek a vote that could remove most of them from power.</p>.<p>Libya has had little peace since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising, and it split in 2014 between eastern and western factions, with rival administrations governing in each area.</p>",

    "title": "Florida priest bites woman during communion dispute",
    "text": "A Central Florida priest admitted to biting the forearm of a woman during a Holy Communion dispute earlier this week, but said he did so to defend himself and the sacrament.\nThe shocking incident unfolded Sunday morning at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, just south of Orlando, when parishioners were receiving communion.\nFather Fidel Rodriguez, 66, told police he refused to give the bread wafer to a woman because she wasn’t aware of proper requirements to receive communion.\nThe woman, whose name hasn’t been released, told police she first showed up for the 10 a.m. mass with her same-sex partner .\nBody camera video obtained by the Catholic News Agency shows a 45-second interaction between the two during communion, when Rodriguez denied her the bread.\nThe woman later told police she suspected she had been singled out because of her sexuality and how she was dressed.\n“I believe that his excuse was that I wasn’t super-holy, in his eyes,” she told investigators — though the priest has denied her sexuality had anything to do with it.\nThe couple later returned for the noon service when she tried again. That’s when the physical confrontation happened, after the woman “grabbed the communion tray of bread out of his hands,” according to a police report.\nRodriguez told police he didn’t deny biting the woman, but he did so in self-defense.\nHe also said he didn’t know the woman or her sexual orientation, adding he doesn’t judge anyone.\n“I am not judging you; I am asking you; did you confess after mass? If you did not confess, I cannot give you communion,” Fidel told investigators when explaining the situation.\nIn a statement sent to local television station WKMG, the Orlando Diocese says “the full video and the police report show the woman initiated physical contact and acted inappropriately,” while Rodriguez was only “ trying to protect the Holy Communion from this sacrilegious act.”\nRodriguez has now been charged with one count of battery, CNA reported Thursday.",

    "text": "A South Korean entertainer, known as Monk DJ, has sparked controversy in Malaysia for his prayer-like dance moves, which are considered disrespectful to the Buddhist faith.\\nYoon Seong-ho, 47, is not a monk, but a comedian who underwent a Buddhist initiation ritual at Jogye Temple in South Korea in November last year.\\nHe was given the Dharma name “New Jin” by his master, which means “striving forward into the new”, according to the China Press.\\nHe calls himself “DJ NewJeansNim” and incorporates Buddhist elements into his electronic music, such as striking a wooden fish.\\nYoon says he aims to use his identity as a DJ to promote a better understanding of Buddhism and to challenge prejudices against it.\\n\\nIn May last year he gained fame with his song Buddha Handsome and attracted 88,400 followers on YouTube.\\nDressed in monk’s robes, Yoon appears at music festivals in South Korea and Malaysia where he mixes music and incorporates rapping and prayer gestures into his live sets.\\nOn May 3, after his performance at a club in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Yoon faced condemnation from local politicians and the Buddhist community.\\nMalaysian lawmaker Wee Ka Siong expressed concerns that DJ NewJeansNim’s performance might misrepresent Buddhist values and teachings.\\nThe Young Buddhist Association of Malaysia received complaints from devotees, saying that his performance was offensive and disrespectful to the Buddhist way of life.\\n“He is not a real monk at all. He is just using Buddhism to gain fame for himself,” one online observer said on YouTube.\\nAs a result, other appearances scheduled for Malaysia, including those planned for May 21 in Kuala Lumpur and May 31 in Melaka, were cancelled.\\n“I’m so disappointed. I wanted some spiritual cleansing and was looking forward to seeing him,” one online observer wrote on Instagram.\\n“Do not give up, you did nothing wrong, and thanks for bringing this show to us,” another person said.\\nIn April, the largest Korean Buddhist sect, the Jogye Order, presented Yoon with a pair of DJ headphones, saying: “New Jin has played a crucial role in promoting new and youthful Buddhism to the younger generation.”\\n\\nOn May 12, Yoon told South Korean television network JTBC that his prayer-like hand movements synchronised with the music are a form of dance aimed at alleviating suffering.\\nHe also integrates Buddhist teachings into his lyrics, such as: “Everything will pass, as long as you overcome suffering, you will reach paradise.”\\nRegarding his sudden fame, Yoon said: “To be honest, I feel a significant sense of responsibility. I need to perform better and I don’t want to let people down.”\\nHe told JTBC that he has studied Chinese and plans to master English this year, which will be beneficial for his international performances.\\nOn May 17, he made his debut show in Hong Kong, performing at a nightclub in the city’s Central district. He will perform in the city again next month.\\n",

Hindus have taken revenge for insulting Lord Ram who is revered by crores of devotees. You are devotees of Nathuram and not of Shri Ram. There is a big message in the results.

The ‘chiru’ (Tibetan antelope) – a protected species under the Wildlife Act – is hunted extensively for its wool, Shahtoosh. File photo | Express Shekhar Singh Updated on: 06 Mar 2025, 2:33 am 2 min read\nCopied\nNEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has reaffirmed that courts cannot impose a punishment lower than the minimum sentence prescribed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.\nJustice Chandra Dhari Singh underscored the legislative intent behind the stringent provisions, emphasising that any dilution of the prescribed punishment would defeat the purpose of the law.\nThe court observed that the Act was enacted to curb wildlife-related crimes, a grave threat to ecological balance and biodiversity. It noted that the exclusion of probationary relief in such cases reflects the legislature’s intent to create a robust deterrent against illegal trade and exploitation of endangered species.\nThe ruling came in response to an appeal by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) challenging an order by a Special Judge. The lower court had sentenced several people convicted under the Wild Life Protection Act to imprisonment for the period already served and imposed a fine of Rs 20,000.\nThis was a modification of an earlier sentence, where the accused had pleaded guilty and were initially directed to pay Rs 10,000 each as fine.\nThe case stemmed from a 2005 raid, during which authorities recovered eight Shahtoosh shawls – banned under Schedule I of the Act – from the accused. The CBI argued that the convicts had been sentenced under Section 51(1A) of the Act, which mandates a minimum imprisonment of three years, extendable to seven years, along with a fine of no less than Rs 10,000. The agency contended that the Special Judge had erroneously exercised discretion by reducing the punishment below the statutory minimum.\nJustice Singh concurred with the CBI, stating that the nature of the offence warranted strict adherence to penal provisions. He criticised the Special Judge’s approach, noting that modifying the sentence to only a fine and time already served effectively diluted the law’s intent.\nAddressing the seriousness of the offence, the court rejected the argument that the accused were not directly involved in poaching. It clarified that the law prohibits not just hunting but also possession, trade, and facilitation of illegal wildlife products.\n“The gravity of such crimes cannot be diminished merely because the accused were not engaged in the actual killing of the animals. The prohibition extends to all forms of involvement in the trade,” the Court observed.\nThe high court set aside the Special Judge order and directed the trial court to reconsider sentencing in accordance with the legal mandates. The matter was remanded for fresh consideration, with the direction that a revised order be passed expeditiously, preferably within three months.",
