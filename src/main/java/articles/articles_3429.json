    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Renfrew County swelters under 3rd heat warning of the summer Mother Nature is turning up the heat on the region as Renfrew County heads into the Civic holiday long weekend. Environment Canada has issued a heat warning for Renfrew County, advising that daytime temperatures will reach between 30 and 32 C Friday, with humidex values reaching 40 degrees. Night time lows are only expected to fall to between 19 and 21 degrees. - [Sign up now for daily CTV News Ottawa newsletters](https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters?cid=event:qr_code_co:ctv-news-ottawa-nl) - [The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App](https://www.ctvnews.ca/app?cid=event:qr_code_co:ctv-news-ottawa-ab) This is the third heat warning issued for Renfrew County already this summer. \"So certainly we expect that this is a hot year,\" said Dr. Jason Morgenstern, the region's Medical Officer of Health. \"We're going to continue to see extreme heat events and we need to be more wary than ever about the potential health effects.\" The Renfrew County and District Health Unit advises that people outdoors spend as much time in the shade as possible, drink fluids before feeling thirsty, and engage in outdoor activity in moderation. \"If you're doing outdoor activities, try to do those in the cooler parts of the day, later in the evening or earlier in the morning,\" says Dr. Morgenstern. \"It's just important to enjoy those outdoor activities as safely as possible. So using sunscreen, wearing a wide brimmed hat, spending as much time in the shade and out of the sun as possible.\" One way people in the Pembroke region are beating the heat is by hitting the water with O'Kenny River Tubing. \"When it's really hot like this, we just have people just stampeding in here,\" says Andrew Kenny, owner of O'Kenny Craft Spirits and River Tubing. On Thursday, Kenny says they already sent 60 people floating down the Muskrat River through Pembroke before the long weekend has even began. \"On days that are hot, people are looking for ways to cool off,\" Kenny says. \"If you gently get into the tube and you float down for the first hour, you'll be sweaty. So we suggest hopping in (the river) and getting wet. Then hopping in the tube.\" The river float beginning at O'Kenny Craft Spirits, located at the intersection of International Drive and Paul Martin Drive, takes anywhere from two to five hours. Kenny says Pembroke is blessed with the Muskrat River being one of the warmest in the region. \"On a day like today, it's actually about 84 to 86 degrees (Fahrenheit). But that is what you want in a pool, right?\" [Ottawa Top Stories](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/) - - - BREAKING BREAKING [Sport court dismisses Canada's appeal in women's soccer case](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/sport-court-dismisses-canada-s-appeal-in-women-s-soccer-case-1.6983977) - - - - - CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING [Sport court dismisses Canada's appeal in women's soccer case](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/sport-court-dismisses-canada-s-appeal-in-women-s-soccer-case-1.6983977) The Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed Canada's appeal of a six-point penalty against its Olympic women's soccer team.

    "text": "Celebrating your mother’s legacy once she’s passed is bittersweet. Claire Khodara and Grace Fuller Marroquin have recently embarked on that journey. Partnering with Lafayette 148, the daughters of photographer Martha Madigan worked with creative director Emily Smith to transform one of Madigan’s photographs into a capsule collection for the brand. “This is something she always wanted to do,” they told the Cut ahead of the exhibition opening. “It picked up a lot of nostalgia for us, but we feel like we’re continuing her legacy in life by doing it.”\nOn Wednesday, Madigan’s family celebrated the launch and opening alongside friends (including Beanie Feldstein , Kathryn Gallagher, Wes Gordon , and many more) at Lafayette 148’s flagship boutique, where over 15 of Madigan’s photographs will be displayed until early April. The clothing collection is made of four pieces — a silk twill blouse, pants, kaftan, and scarf — all featuring Madigan’s 2010 photo Oahu Hanging Ginger , which Smith chose from Madigan’s studio in Philadelphia when the collaboration began.\n“We showed Emily a bunch of cyanotypes and she picked this one thinking it was a six-foot-tall image,” said Khodara. “Even today she told me, ‘I can’t believe that it was only 12 by 12 inches.’ My mom worked with actual foliage — she dried them and shipped them back from Hawaii — so the Oahu hanging ginger is actually that size.”\nMadigan’s work, which began in the 1970s, is unique in that it uses a cameraless process using cyanotype, sunlight, and nature. While the work was often done on paper, Fuller Marroquin recalls that “my mother would constantly toil and experiment using cyanotypes with fabric,” which led to the easy translation of her prints on the silk of the collection. While nature is clearly abundant in these pieces, you can also feel the love between mother and daughters that seeps through every article of clothing. Describing it as both “natural and ethereal,” the daughters shared that their favorite pieces of the collection are the kaftan and the silk top. However, I left the evening quietly fawning over Khodara’s custom-made dress for the event, a tighter long-sleeve silk option made for her to perform in.\nBelow, some moments from the event.\nGrace Fuller Marroquin and Claire Khodara.\nBeanie Feldstein and Kathryn Gallagher.\nWes Gordon, Indré Rockefeller, and Paul Arnhold.\nDee Poku",

En su cuenta de la red social X, García-Page se ha congratulado de que Cataluña pase a tener a \\\"alguien que se ocupe de los problemas de los catalanes\\\", a lo que ha añadido que su responsabilidad es \\\"defender los intereses de Castilla-La Mancha como región de España\\\". \\\"Espero que podamos llegar a entendernos\\\", ha añadido el dirigente castellanomanchego, muy crítico con el acuerdo alcanzado por PSC y ERC por el que Cataluña pasará a tener una financiación singular. García-Page se ha referido también a Puigdemont, quien ha regresado hoy a Barcelona después de siete años huido, aunque se le ha perdido la pista tras participar en un mitin. El presidente de Castilla-La Mancha ha asegurado que siente \\\"profunda vergüenza y profundo sonrojo\\\" por que la gobernabilidad de España dependa de alguien como Puigdemont. \\\"Espero que ya nadie le incluya cuando se hable de mayoría progresista\\\", ha agregado.",

    "text": "El Lenovo Tenerife logró su octava victoria de la temporada y se jugará sus opciones de disputar la Copa del Rey en la última jornada de la primera vuelta, al vencer este jueves en el Palacio de los Deportes de Granada por 68-80 al Covirán Granada, que pone fin a su racha de buenos resultados aunque sigue fuera de los puestos de descenso. El Lenovo Tenerife empezó mejor el partido (4-8, m.3) ante un Covirán Granada que tomó la delantera con su acierto cerca del aro (14-10, m.7) y que fue capaz de acabar por encima en el marcador el igualado primer cuarto (18-17). El acierto del serbio Dusan Ristic dio ventaja a los visitantes (23-28, m.15 tras once puntos seguidos del balcánico), renta ampliada porque a los locales les costaba un mundo anotar ante la buena defensa tinerfeña (28-38, m.18 y segundo tiempo en el cuarto pedido por Pablo Pin). El Lenovo Tenerife llegó al descanso mandando en el partido por 30-38 tras ser mejor y estar más acertado en ataque que el cuadro andaluz. La gran defensa sobre el estadounidense Joe Thomasson, la estrella local, y la buena lectura del juego en ataque con un gran Marcelinho Huertas permitió al Lenovo Tenerife ampliar aún más su renta en el tercer cuarto (35-50, m.24). El Covirán Granada reaccionó con un parcial de 10-0 (45-50, m.29), aunque los de Txus Vidorreta se repusieron levemente para entrar en el cuarto final con nueve puntos de ventaja (45-54). La buena defensa de los locales les metió del todo en el partido (57-59, m.34), con los visitantes agarrados a los puntos del estadounidense Elgin Cook para poder respirar (57-64, m.36). El Covirán Granada falló los triples que podían haber provocado un final igualado y el Lenovo Tenerife controló a la perfección los minutos definitivos y supo jugar con su ventaja guiados por un sensacional Marcelinho Huertas. -- Ficha técnica: 68 - Covirán Granada (18+12+15+23): Rousselle (4), Thomasson (10), Tomás (7), Cheatham (16), Felicio (7) -quinteto inicial- Díaz (5), Kramer (7), Martínez (2), Kairys (10), Iriarte (0). 80 - Lenovo Tenerife (17+21+16+26): Huertas (20), Salin (8), Cook (12), Doornekamp (7), Shermadini (8) -quinteto inicial- Fernández (4), Fitipaldo (2), Ristic (11), Sastre (0), Abromaitis (8). Árbitros: Antonio Conde, Jorge Martínez y Vicente Martínez. Sin eliminados por faltas personales. Incidencias: Partido correspondiente a la decimoquinta jornada de la Liga Endesa disputado en el Palacio de los Deportes de Granada ante 8.083 espectadores, según cifra oficial.
