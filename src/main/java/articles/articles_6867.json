    "text": "El Inter Miami se quedó lejos de remontar al Vancouver en las semifinales de la Concachampions. Los encabezados por Lionel Messi sufrieron una dolorosa derrota 3-1 en casa (5-1 global) para despedirse del torneo más importante de la región. Como era de esperarse, los memes inundaron las redes sociales en burlas dirigidas al astro argentino, quien poco pudo hacer para evitar la eliminación en el Chase Stadium.\nLas esperanzas de avanzar a las final duraron todo el primer tiempo del partido en Miami, Jordi Alba abrió el marcador al minuto 9 para darle emoción a la serie. La máquina llena de ex jugadores del Barcelona parecía cerca de igualar la serie cuando llegó el descanso. La historia cambió en el complemento, el tanto de Brian White puso el panorama cuesta arriba y los goles de Pedro Vite y Sebastian Berhalter acabaron cualquier aspiración.\nCuando Lionel Messi arribó a la Major League Soccer lo hizo con el pie derecho tras conquistar la Leagues Cup, sin embargo, en las competencias recientes el Inter Miami se apuntó dos fracasos tras quedar fuera en primera ronda de los playoffs y ahora se despidió en las semifinales de la Concachampions. Al conjunto del astro argentino sólo le queda levantar la cara porque se avecina el Mundial de Clubes.\nTe podría interesar\nVancouver continúa como el caballo negro tras eliminar a Rayados, Pumas e Inter Miami, su victoria también puso punto final a cualquier sueño de ver a Lionel Messi en un estadio de México. El rival de los canadienses en la final programada para el próximo 1 de junio saldrá de la serie entre Cruz Azul y Tigres, la cual se definirá este jueves 1 de mayo. Hasta el momento todo se encuentra empatado 1-1 en el global.\n¿Cuándo será el próximo partido de Lionel Messi y el Inter Miami?\nA Lionel Messi solo le queda superar los memes y el trago amargo de la eliminación antes del siguiente partido del Inter Miami, el cual será el sábado 3 de mayo cuando reciban al New York Red Bulls.\nTe podría interesar",

    "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. — A damning report from Attorney General Dana Nessel's office. The 144-page report details sexual abuse allegations involving nearly two dozen priests within The Diocese of Kalamazoo. Some dating back to January of 1950. This report is only one part of a long-running investigation happening in Michigan. Kalamazoo is the third of seven clergy allegations in Michigan. The first in Marquette and the second in Gaylord. The Attorney Generals’ office has been working to pursue criminal charges against the alleged sexual misconduct of priest in the mitten since October of 2018. “The Psalms tell us that it is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in men and we see how true this is,” said Bishop Lohse. “Cases of sexual abuse and assault are thoroughly reviewed and whenever we are able to pursue criminal charges we do so relentlessly,” said Attorney General Nessel. Bishop Edward Lohse for The Diocese of Kalamazoo said the allegations are heartbreaking. “For any way in which we have failed you, the faithful who come to mass Sunday after Sunday, I am deeply sorry,” said Bishop Lohse. AG Nessels report does not criminally charge anyone with sexual assault or sexual abuse because there wasn’t enough evidence, or the statute of limitations has run out. In some cases, there simply was not enough evidence. Her report highlights her office has been and continues the investigation into years’ worth of allegations dating back over seven decades. “I wish to confirm that no priest identified in The Attorney General’s report is currently in active ministry,” said Bishop Lohse. In the report for Kalamazoo 24 adults have been accused of sexual misconduct, 19 of them were priests. “Twelve were ordained or incarnated by The Diocese of Kalamazoo. I must note that of course a criminal charge is merely an allegation and presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty,” said Attorney General Nessel. Two of the men named in the report have been charged by AG Nessels office. Father Jacob Vellian, a priest at St. John the Evengelist parish in Benton Harbor was charged in May 2019 on two counts of rape. He died in December 2022. Second is Father Brian Stanley, a priest at St. Margarets Catholic Church in Otsego. News Channel 3 was in the courtroom when Stanley was charged in 2019. “Was sentenced in January of 2020 to 60 days incarceration and 5 years’ probation on one count of attempted false imprisonment. Stanley plead guilty in January 2020 to immobilizing a teenage boy by wrapping him tightly in plastic wrap.” The report says quote, “it covered his eyes. Fr. Stanley cut holes in the cellophane for him to breathe.” “He could only mumble yes and no and shake his head because his arms were on top of his chest, and he was wrapped tightly in the cellophane.” Father Stanley left the child alone in the janitors closet for hours before letting him out back in 2013. Not only does the report talk about the allegations of sexual misconduct regarding children, it also talks about that of adults. AG Nessel credited Bishop Lohse and The Diocese of Kalamazoo for their cooperation in their years long investigation which is far from being over. “As part of my clergy abuse investigation to date my department has issued criminal charges in 11 cases and has secured convictions in 9 resulting in justice for at least 38 survivors, “said Attorney General Nessel.",

    "text": "Tom McKibbin snubbed the advice of Rory Mcllroy after deciding to join Jon Rahm's Legion XIII LIV Golf team.\nOn Wednesday, it was confirmed the 22-year-old, who had earned a place on the PGA Tour this season, would be joining LIV Golf for the new LIV season, which begins in Saudi Arabia next week. And in moving to LIV, McKibbin will be teaming up with Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Caleb Surratt.\nMcKibbin came through Holywood Golf Club in Northern Ireland, the same club four-time major winner Mcllroy did. And in choosing to join the Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway league, McKibbin snubbed the advice of Mcllroy from earlier this month.\n\"As soon as he [McKibbin] got the offer, he rang me,\" McIlroy said at the Dubai Desert Classic. \"We had a really good conversation and I talked to him multiple times over the course of December to sort of get a feel for what he was thinking and basically what he was going to do. All I could do is give my perspective.\n\"I really like Tom as a person, as a player. I think he’s got a tonne of potential. I said to him: ‘If I were in your shoes, I would make a different choice than the one you’re thinking of making.’\n\"Working so hard to get your card in the States, something that he did, to achieve that goal last year was a big achievement. I think what he potentially is sacrificing and giving up with access to majors, potential Ryder Cup spot … I don’t think anything is official yet but if I were in his position and I had his potential, which I think I have been before, I wouldn’t make that decision.\nFollow us on Xfor the best and latest in sports news\n\"But I’m not him. I’m not in his shoes. He’s a grown man at this point and can make his own decisions. All I can do is try to give him my perspective.\n\"Personally for me it would be a little disappointing if it were to happen but I made it perfectly clear: ‘I am not going to stand in your way if you need to make the decision you feel like you need to make for yourself.’ But at the same time, I feel like he’s giving up a lot to not really benefit that much.\"\nWant to watch more live sports?
