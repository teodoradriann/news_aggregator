    "title": "In 2023, an endless drought in the Pyrénées-Orientales - timenews",
    "text": "2023-12-29 12:00:05 The Vinça reservoir, in the Pyrénées-Orientales, December 9, 2023. ED JONES/AFP In the Pyrénées-Orientales, the year ends as it began: without rain. According to provisional data from Météo-France, the department experienced a record drought, even more severe than that of 2022 – a year which had already been the least wet in the history of records. This precipitation deficit is a strong characteristic of French Catalonia, where there were no more unusually high temperatures than in the rest of French territory. “Across the entire department, the precipitation results are catastrophic, with stations which have often accumulated half, or even less, of normal levels”, specifies Tristan Amm, forecaster at Météo-France. In Perpignan, for example, the cumulative rainfall reached 250 millimeters (mm), or almost 20% less than the 2022 record, at 305 mm cumulative. “To give an idea of what this represents, you should know that the 1991-2020 average is 571 mm of accumulation per year in Perpignan, explains Mr. Amm. The city’s record rainfall saw a cumulative 222 mm in a single day, November 12, 1999. That’s almost as much in twenty-four hours as in the whole of the past year… A “rail of depressions” Even the exceptional rains of autumn did not benefit the Roussillon plain and the Aspres massif. “Between mid-October and mid-November, France was swept by an almost uninterrupted succession of rainy spells, favored by a “rail of depressions” over the near Atlantic. (…), explains Météo-France, in its provisional report. Never before have such quantities of rain been measured in thirty consecutive days across the country. Locally, the accumulations approached 900 mm in the Massif Central, 800 mm in the Vosges, 500 mm in Pas-de-Calais, 400 mm in Poitou-Charentes, while they did not exceed 25 mm in Perpignan. » As of December 1, the Bureau of Geological and Mining Research (BRGM) noted in its bulletin that the aquifer of the Roussillon plain was still “extremely degraded, with very low levels” and “charging does not seem[ait] not having started ». In any case, the coming year will also be marked by difficulties, in particular for the agricultural sector, dominated in the department by arboriculture and viticulture. “It seems difficult to sustainably reconstitute the Roussillon aquifer reserves by spring 2024”notes the BRGM.

But we have good reason to believe that warming will make more intense and longer droughts, but also episodes of extreme precipitation, more likely. » An oscillation between extremes which is already one of the climatic characteristics of the Mediterranean foothills of the Pyrenees.

    "text": "Katie Ledecky tells NPR about her plans for the Paris Olympics — and L.A. in 2028 Katie Ledecky is used to getting medals. She has 10 Olympic medals — seven of which are gold — and she has 26 world championship medals — 21 of those are gold. All of that hardware has helped her earn the undisputed title as the greatest female swimmer of all time. But on Friday, she will receive a different kind of medal: the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a civilian can get from the U.S. government. Ledecky spoke to All Things Considered host Juana Summers about what the medal means to her, how she is thinking about the Paris Olympics in July-August, and why she has no plans to retire after this summer. Juana Summers will be in Paris covering the Olympics for NPR. You can follow all her reporting on All Things Considered. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Interview highlights Juana Summers: Alright Katie, so this medal — does this one go in the same trophy cases as your Olympic medals? What do you think you're going to do with it? Katie Ledecky: Oh, I have not even thought of that yet! This is definitely one that's very meaningful and very unique. And never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined I would be receiving this recognition. So I'm very, very honored. Summers: Let's look ahead if we can, because this could be another incredibly big year for you. The Summer Olympics start in just a few months in Paris — how are you feeling in the pool these days? Do you feel like you're ready? Ledecky: I'm ready. We have our Olympic trials in about a month now. So that's what I'm gearing up for, I have one more meet before then. So everything is tracking well, my training is going well. And I'm really excited for hopefully the opportunity to represent the U.S. at a fourth Olympics. I can't believe that I get this opportunity and it's gonna be a great summer and I'm excited. Summers: If the trials go your way, and you do indeed get to represent the U.S. at your fourth Olympic Games, do you know which event you will be most excited for? Ledecky: Oh, well, I hope I'll be competing in multiple events. And each one is special in a different way. The 800 free has always been my favorite and the event that I swam at my first Olympics in 2012, which I won gold at at age 15. So that's one that I hold a special place for in my heart. But I love all my events. And I'm looking forward to each of the challenges that I'll have with each of the races. Summers: If you head to Paris, do you think they will be your last? Do you think we'll see you come back for the 2028 games in Los Angeles? Ledecky: I take things year by year, but right now, I definitely could see myself competing in 2028, with it being a home Olympics. It's something that's very unique. It's something that not every Olympic athlete gets. And so I definitely know I'm not retiring after this summer and 2028 is very appealing. So I think, at this point, I want to be there, I want to compete in at least one event, maybe more. But again, plans can change. It's a long ways away, my focus is solely on this summer in Paris at this moment. Summers: You know, I have to say you have been such an inspiration for so many young women athletes, whether they are swimmers or competitors in other sports, just due to your dominance, the number of medals you've amassed, your longevity in your sport, and now receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is one of the highest awards a civilian can get in the United States. How do you think about your career, what you represent, what you show to a new generation of athletes, particularly women athletes? Ledecky: Oh, thank you for the kind words. I tried to give as much as I can. And I hope that young girls look up to me and can see the work that I've put in and the results that I've had and what I've tried to accomplish in and out of the pool. I hope they see that and are inspired by it, whether they're a swimmer or not. I think, you know, I've learned a lot through the sport. And through this over a decade-long journey I've had at the international level, I've learned a lot about goal setting and dedication and resilience. Summers: Is there a lesson or a story about resilience you would share for the folks who look to you as a role model? Ledecky: Sure, I think one story that I think a lot of Olympic athletes would tell you is about our experience in 2020 and 2021 and the Olympics being postponed a year. In swimming, the Olympics is the pinnacle of our sport and we build four-year plans to peak at the Olympics and to be our very best. And so to have that pushed a year and to be kind of living under uncertain circumstances, and not knowing whether the Olympics would actually happen, I think took a lot of resilience for all of us, and we all had to adapt and train in backyard pools and do weightlifting in our homes or apartments and all those things. So I learned a lot about myself during that time, learned that you can adapt and you can adjust to change. And certainly, we weren't going through the worst of it during that time — I felt very lucky and fortunate to have a goal and something to work towards with the Olympics. I know that so many people during that time were suffering a lot more than we were. I think having those experiences have made me tougher, and really taught me that I'm able to adapt when things don't go the way that I anticipate they'll go. Summers: Katie, whether Paris is your last Olympics, or you go to L.A., or even beyond, eventually, you will stop swimming competitively. What do you think about when you think about that future? Is that something you don't even consider right now? Ledecky: I haven't thought about it too much. But for me, when I think of swimming, and I think of this career that I've had, I think of all the joy that I've had in the sport, and everything that I've been able to learn through the sport, all the people that I've gotten to meet through the sport, all the places that I've gotten to go through competitive swimming. And I think because of all that joy that I've experienced in the sport, it's something that I'm never going to stop doing. Of course, some day my competitive career will come to an end and I'm not going to be looking at the clock or having a coach get my times every every set. But I think I'll always find myself going back to the pool and swimming some laps or splashing around. And it's a place that I find so much joy. As we get into the summer months, I hope that a lot of other people can find that joy and learn how to swim. It's such an important life skill. And, in my view, the greatest sport on earth, and something that you can do for the rest of your life. I hope that I'll be swimming into my 90s — I have a 98-year-old grandma, so I'm lucky to have some good genes there, and I hope that I'll be able to stay healthy and happy, and happy in the pool and happy in the water. It's definitely my happy place. Copyright 2024 NPR",

    "text": "I remember falling in love with fashion when I was seven years old.\nMy mum had taken me shopping , and I spotted a pair of hot pink cowboy boots in the window of one of the stores. It was love at first sight, and I begged my mum to buy them for me.\nDespite her saying, \"People will need sunglasses to see you when you wear those boots because they’re so bright,\" I wore those flashy boots to death. Every day for more than two years, I paired those boots with almost every outfit I owned until they literally fell apart.\nSince then, I’ve never stopped loving fashion. Fashion is not just the clothes I put on, but it’s how I express my personality. With such a passion for the art of dressing, I noticed as I got older that no matter the price tag, almost all the clothing I bought would fray and look old after only a few wears.\nWatch: Mamamia Reviews Non Family Friendly Fashion. Post continues after video .\nVideo via Mamamia . In a world of fast fashion, I became increasingly aware that much of the imported clothing I was buying in Australia had been made in a sweatshop. These are places where women and children are overworked and underpaid, sometimes working up to 16-hour days for less than 20 cents per day.\nI was also surprised to discover that up to 63 per cent of Australia’s clothing is made from plastic-derived and non-biodegradable fabrics like polyester, nylon and acrylic. So, concerned about clothing’s effect on the environment and the exploitation of people in sweatshops, seven years ago, I decided that I would always try my best to only buy second-hand.\nThese clothes were amazingly refreshing and not to mention, beautiful.\nNot only did I want to wear clothes that were sustainable and ethically sourced, but I also aimed to look stylish and feel like a million bucks without the environmental impacts – plus, it also never hurt if it had op-shop prices!\nI have never regretted my decision.\nToday, my shopping habits revolve almost entirely around vintage stores. My wardrobe has developed a personality of its own. This brings me a lot of joy as I get to wear outrageous and incredible outfits that elicit compliments from friends and strangers alike.\nBeyond being a personal style statement, I’ve found that my vintage clothes serve as a great conversation starter. When I wear my vintage silk scarf or my thrifted red coat, I feel good knowing that I’m breathing new life into clothing that would otherwise have been tossed into landfill.\nImage: Supplied.\nI know that some people may think that all op-shops have to offer is ugly clothing, but I could not disagree more. I think second-hand and vintage clothing is fun.\nThese garments have a story to tell and they’re from a time when fast-fashion wasn’t part of the vocabulary. Clothing made in the '60s, '70s and '80s were made to last. These clothes have survived the test of time and at this point are pushing more than 50 years old while still being in great shape.\nTo top it all off, in 2023 all these clothes, like '80s high-waisted jeans and shoulder pads are fashionable and cool again and have now become a style I affectionately call, \"Grandma Chic.\"\nWhen I walk into an op-shop these days I feel a sense of excitement and adventure. Each store is like a treasure hunt, and I’m not sure what I’m going to find. Sometimes it’s nothing, but other times it’s a beautiful 1950s dress or a $10 jumper that I need for winter.\nSara Kaltmann January 5, 2024\nShare via facebook\nShare via twitter\nShare via whatsapp\nSMS Share via SMS\nShare via e-mail Leave a comment Listen Now\n00:00\nJessie Stephens And The Lies She Keeps Telling Mamamia Out Loud The Spill Inside Gwyneth Paltrow's Morning Routine You Beauty ADVERTISEMENT For me, changing my shopping habits helps me feel like I’m taking a stance against the fast-fashion industry and doing something to help save more clothes from going into landfill. Simultaneously, vintage clothing gives me flashes of nostalgia and I feel warm thinking about the history of these garments and the life they’ve lived before me.\nI love beautiful and unique clothes, and if you haven’t already – consider joining me and countless others on this thrifting journey to a more sustainable and Grandma Chic future!\nFeature Image: Supplied.",

    "text": "Este miércoles, la Cámara Contencioso Administrativa de 3ra Nominación de Córdoba falló a favor del amparo ambiental colectivo presentado por la Fundación para el Desarrollo de Políticas Sustentables (Fundeps) en 2022 por el estado de deterioro ecológico del embalse San Roque, en Punilla.\nTres años después, la sentencia reconoce la existencia de un grave daño ambiental y responsabiliza tanto al Estado provincial como a las autoridades de los municipios de la cuenca regional por acción y omisión. A la vez, ordena una serie de medidas inmediatas y estructurales para garantizar el derecho a un ambiente sano.\n“Esta sentencia marca un antes y un después. Reconoce que hay una crisis ambiental y sanitaria que afecta derechos fundamentales y exige respuestas urgentes, coordinadas y transparentes. Es un triunfo colectivo por el ambiente y la salud de miles de personas”, señaló Mayca Balaguer, directora ejecutiva de Fundeps.\nLa acción de amparo fue presentada por la organización en noviembre de 2022, luego de realizar una investigación sobre la contaminación del lago San Roque, visibilizada especialmente por la persistente proliferación de algas (cianobacterias).\nSegún explicaron desde Fundeps, estas algas están relacionadas directamente con los vertidos cloacales sin tratar, una de las principales fuentes de contaminación del embalse, que abastece de agua a la ciudad de Córdoba y a municipios del Gran Córdoba.\n“La imagen del lago cada vez más verde, con esas floraciones de algas tóxicas, nos alertaba desde hace años. Lo que hicimos fue respaldar esa alarma con datos, estudios científicos, y llevarlo a la Justicia para que se tomen medidas concretas”, explicó Balaguer.\nLa sentencia\nEl fallo obliga a ejecutar de forma efectiva el “Plan de Saneamiento y de Desarrollo Sostenible”, presentado por la Provincia durante el proceso judicial.\nSin embargo, la Justicia estableció que ese plan debe ser reformulado en un plazo de 30 días, incorporando criterios de integralidad, urgencia ambiental, participación ciudadana y transparencia.\nUno de los puntos más relevantes es la exigencia de acelerar la cobertura de la red cloacal: mientras que la Provincia había previsto alcanzar un 50% en 15 años, el tribunal ordena elevar ese objetivo al 85% en solo ocho años.\n“Esto eleva sustancialmente el estándar y marca que la cuestión cloacal es prioritaria. Celebramos que la Justicia haya entendido que no se puede esperar más”, subrayó Balaguer.\nAdemás, la sentencia establece el cese inmediato de vertidos contaminantes y fiscalización intensiva, con sanciones a los incumplimientos; una auditoría técnica obligatoria dentro de seis meses para evaluar avances y cumplimiento; la publicación de una plataforma digital en 90 días, accesible y actualizada en tiempo real, con participación ciudadana abierta; la puesta en marcha de campañas sostenidas de educación ambiental en toda la cuenca; la participación activa de ciudadanía, organizaciones sociales y el ámbito académico en la planificación y el seguimiento del plan.\nResponsabilidad estatal y participación ciudadana\nPor otro lado, el fallo le da a la Autoridad de Cuenca creada por el actual Gobierno provincial el rol de contralor y ejecución del programa de saneamiento.\nAunque no desconoce la autonomía municipal, remarca el rol de la Provincia como responsable última en la protección del recurso hídrico, obligándola a cooperar técnica y financieramente con los gobiernos locales.\nEn cuanto a la implementación efectiva del fallo, Balaguer reconoció que el riesgo de inacción siempre existe, pero valoró las herramientas de control dispuestas por la justicia. “Se establece un mecanismo de seguimiento con informes semestrales y se habilita un espacio para auditorías y participación social. Esta vez hay un marco que da más garantías. Y desde Fundeps, como impulsoras de este proceso, vamos a seguirlo de cerca”.\nUn proceso que comenzó con un diagnóstico\nLa presentación judicial no fue espontánea. En 2021, Fundeps publicó un informe sobre el estado de las principales cuencas hídricas de Córdoba.\nEl relevamiento sobre el San Roque fue especialmente alarmante: se documentaron las principales fuentes de contaminación, sus consecuencias y la ausencia de políticas públicas integrales.\n“El saneamiento del lago debe ser una verdadera política de Estado, que trascienda gestiones. Para eso hace falta cooperación entre la Provincia, los municipios, la academia y la ciudadanía”, concluyó Balaguer.\nCon este fallo, desde Fundeps se considera que se sienta un precedente fundamental para el litigio ambiental en el país y se abre una nueva etapa en la defensa del agua, la salud y el ambiente.",

    "text": "> NEW YORK (TNS) — The back-to-the-SAT bandwagon rolls on. As swiftly as they followed the leader in dropping the standardized test as an admission requirement, the elite schools are reversing course.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology was an early re-adopter, back in 2022. Earlier this year, Dartmouth followed suit. In February, Yale hopped aboard. Brown joined them this month, and although other Ivies say they’re holding firm on keeping the SAT optional, news reports suggest that Penn, too, might soon be headed back to the future.\nIt seems increasingly clear that the anti-SAT movement was just a fad. Like many fads, this one had people joining in without taking the time to think things through. The determination to do something about racial injustice was in the air and activists had been campaigning against standardized tests for years. They made an easy target — and once one or two schools dropped them, following along was the path of least resistance.\nIt’s called the bandwagon effect — the tendency to do what other people are doing without pausing to figure out whether those others are right. The schools now reversing course acted too fast in dropping the tests, without the thoughtful consideration that higher education should exemplify.\nThis bandwagon effect was first noted in politics, but recent decades have seen a deluge of papers using the theory to analyze the behavior of consumers. Institutions, too, like to climb on bandwagons. A much-cited 2000 study found that firms that adopt trendy management techniques tend to be more admired, even when the innovations don’t yield better results compared to peers. A 2020 literature review shows little has changed.\nBandwagon thinking is forgivable when people are deciding which sweater to buy or which country to visit. But it’s troubling that institutions of higher learning should be so hasty to join the crowd.\nIn explaining the school’s long-expected decision to reinstate a standardized test requirement for applicants, Brown’s provost put it this way: “Our analysis made clear that SAT and ACT scores are among the key indicators that help predict a student’s ability to succeed and thrive in Brown’s demanding academic environment.”\nThe sad part is that we already knew that. We also knew, as many an analyst has lately pointed out, that the tests had been a help — not a hindrance — in diversifying the campus. Surely the colleges that rushed to abandon them were aware of their utility; if they didn’t know, shame on them for not troubling to find out. The re-adopters all commissioned formal studies prior to reversing themselves. But the time to undertake analysis was before deciding to drop the tests in the first place. Instead — as the bandwagon effect predicts — colleges hopped aboard without making a serious effort to determine whether the wagon was rolling in the right direction. All they knew for sure was that they didn’t want to be left behind.\nDon’t get me wrong. The tests have their limitations. But they’re higher education’s version of Churchill’s mot about democracy: in this world of sin and woe, they’re neither perfect nor all-wise; they’re the worst admission requirement except for all those others that have been tried from time to time.\nAs the over-hasty colleges now sheepishly concede.\nI recognize that the elite schools are in a tough position. They want diverse student bodies, but last year the Supreme Court put a damper on their ability to work directly toward that end. I thought the majority was wrong, but the decision is what it is.\nThe main loophole it left was enabling students to tell stories of how they’d overcome the costs exacted by race. This makes sense, given that for disadvantaged college students, “grit” seems to be a strong predictor of academic success. (At least in the first year.)\nBut measuring grit is hard. One promising suggestion that deserves further study is to compare the test scores of applicants with those not at the same school but in the same zip code. Of course, the admission essays might be the best tools, except that now they’re being written by generative AI.\nThat’s a problem for another day. For now, let it suffice to say that the schools that dropped test requirements, in their rush to showcase their support for diversity, acted too precipitously. They had nothing to guide them but the choices of their peers. Nobody wanted to be the kid in last year’s outfit. And so they went along with the crowd.\nThat’s always the risk when one hops aboard the bandwagon: Somebody else is in the driver’s seat.\n(Stephen L.
