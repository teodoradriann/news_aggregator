(AFP Photo) Moscow: WhatsApp said Russia was trying to block its services because the social media messaging app owned by Meta offered people's right to secure communication, and vowed to continue trying to make encrypted services available in Russia. Russia has started restricting some Telegram and WhatsApp calls, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. \"WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people's right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,\" WhatsApp said in a statement. \"We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.\" Telegram said its moderators were using AI tools to monitor public parts of the platform to remove millions of malicious messages every day. \"Telegram actively combats harmful use of its platform including calls for sabotage or violence and fraud,\" Telegram said in a statement. Russia has clashed with foreign tech platforms for several years over content and data storage in a simmering dispute that intensified after Moscow's sent its army into Ukraine in February 2022, with critics saying that Russia is trying to expand its control over the country's internet space.

    "title": "Growth Galore: 7 Long-Term Stock Picks for Prolonged Prosperity",
    "text": "In the late 1950s, the [average holding period](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-long-term-investing/) for stocks was eight years. The average holding period had declined to 5.5 months as of June 2020. It’s unlikely to be any different in 2023. Of course, one reason for the decline in holding period is continued technological advancement that’s translates into new investment ideas. However, there is no doubt on the point that investor patience has declined. This column talks about seven long-term stocks that are likely to create value on a sustained basis. I must add here that even quality [blue-chip stocks](https://investorplace.com/stock-types/blue-chip-stocks/) can deliver long term returns that consistently bests the index. However, my focus in this column is on [growth stocks](https://investorplace.com/stock-types/growth-stocks/) that are worth holding until 2030. In my view, these long-term stocks can deliver 5x to 10x returns over the investment horizon. Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these growth stories. Pinterest (PINS) After trading at lows of $20.6 during the year, Pinterest (NYSE: [PINS](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pins-stock-quote/)) stock has trended higher by 41% in the last six months. The downside in PINS stock was on account of growth and valuation adjustments in the post-pandemic world. With that factor being discounted and with a [positive outlook](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4045049-snap-pinterest-gain-as-brokerages-see-improving-advertising-outlook) for the advertising industry, I am bullish on further upside for PINS stock. For Q3 2023, Pinterest reported revenue growth of 11% on a year-on-year basis to $763 million. This was the highest growth in the last five quarters. I believe the positive momentum is likely to sustain in the coming quarters. Pinterest reported 258 million monthly active users for the rest of the world (ROW) in Q3. In comparison, the MAU for U.S. and Europe were 96 and 128 million. However, the [average revenue per user](https://s23.q4cdn.com/958601754/files/doc_earnings/2023/q3/presentation/2023-Q3-IR-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) for ROW was just 12 cents with the global average being $1.61. As emerging markets catch-up in terms of advertising spend, there is ample scope for revenue and cash flow upside even if MAUs remain stable. Pinterest is likely to report operating cash flow of $500 million for the year. As the ARPU swells, the business will be a cash flow machine. Amdocs (DOX) Amdocs (NASDAQ: [DOX](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/dox-stock-quote/)) stock looks interesting after remaining sideways in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 13.6, the stock seems poised for a breakout rally. Further, DOX stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 1.96%. As an overview, Amdocs is a provider of software and services to the media and telecommunication industry globally. For FY 2023, Amdocs reported revenue of $4.9 billion. Further, the company has a 12-month backlog of $4.15 billion, which provides clear revenue visibility. Another positive is that Amdocs [reported free cash flow of $698 million](https://investors.amdocs.com/static-files/3cd0613c-cb5c-4ed3-ab9d-f26bd4fa549a). As of September, Amdocs had a liquidity buffer of $1.2 billion. Financial flexibility is therefore high for organic and acquisition driven growth. In November, Amdocs partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/)) “to optimize large language models to [speed adoption of generative AI applications and services](https://www.amdocs.com/news-press/amdocs-and-nvidia-accelerate-adoption-generative-ai-17-trillion-telecom) across the $1.7 trillion telecommunications and media industries.” In a big addressable market, the free cash flow outlook for the coming years looks robust. DraftKings (DKNG) Considering the growth potential for the online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming industry in the United States, DraftKings (NASDAQ: [DKNG](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/dkng-stock-quote/)) is a long term value creator. For year-to-date, DKNG has surged by 223% from oversold levels. The stock can be considered on corrections and consolidation. Talking about the market size, DraftKings expects the total addressable market for OSB and iGaming to be [$30 billion by 2030](https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/static-files/b6f14c7f-f4dd-4fcb-8c3c-637de5db2afb). This is just for the markets in which the Company is currently active. As more states legalize OSB and iGaming, the addressable market will swell. However, the key game-changer for DraftKings in 2023 has been improvement in EBITDA margin. For the next financial year, DraftKings has [guided for revenue and EBITDA](https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/draftkings-reports-third-quarter-revenue-790-million-raises-2023) of $4.65 billion and $400 million. It’s likely that EBITDA margin will continue to expand beyond 2024. This sets stage for healthy revenue growth coupled with upside in cash flows. Kinross Gold (KGC) As gold trends higher on the prospects of multiple rate cuts, I am bullish on gold mining stocks. Further, factors like inflation and geopolitical tension support gold upside through the decade. Among emerging names, I like Kinross Gold (NYSE: [KGC](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kgc-stock-quote/)) and I believe that the stock is a potential multibagger. It’s worth noting that KGC stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 15.3. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 1.94%. I expect healthy dividend growth in the coming years. Coming to the fundamentals, Kinross reported a [liquidity buffer of $2 billion](https://www.kinross.com/news-and-investors/news-releases/press-release-details/2023/Kinross-reports-strong-2023-third-quarter-results/default.aspx). Further, the Company is on track to deliver annual operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. With high financial flexibility, Kinross is positioned for organic and acquisition driven growth. I anticipate acquisitions with the Company guiding for stable production growth through 2025. The sale of Russian assets in 2022 was a setback that’s likely to be compensated with an opportunistic acquisition. Piedmont Lithium (PLL) Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: [PLL](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pll-stock-quote/)) is among the deeply undervalued [lithium stocks](https://investorplace.com/industries/energy/renewable-energy/battery/lithium/) to buy for the long term. The correction in PLL stock has been driven by a decline in lithium prices. However, the long-term outlook for lithium is positive and Piedmont has quality assets. I expect multibagger returns in the next few years. It’s worth noting that Piedmont has commenced lithium concentrate shipments in Q3. For the quarter, the Company [reported revenue and EBITDA](https://piedmontlithium.com/wp-content/uploads/Piedmont-Lithium-Reports-Third-Quarter-2023-Results-US.pdf) of $47.1 million and $16.2 million respectively. I expect the current EBITDA margin of 34.3% to improve significantly as lithium trends higher. From a growth perspective, the commencement of lithium concentrate sales from the Quebec asset is just the beginning. Piedmont expect to [ramp-up production](https://piedmontlithium.com/wp-content/uploads/Earnings-Presentation-Q3-2023-vFINAL.pdf) from 56,500ktpy in 2023 to 525,000ktpa in 2026. This would translate into stellar revenue and cash flow growth. The recent correction in PLL stock therefore offers a golden opportunity for long term exposure. Coupang (CPNG) Coupang (NYSE: [CPNG](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cpng-stock-quote/)) stock has been almost sideways in the last 12 months. I expect upside after an extended period of consolidation as business metrics improve. It’s worth noting that [e-commerce stocks](https://investorplace.com/industries/consumer-discretionary/retail/e-commerce/) have witnessed valuation readjustments after the pandemic. This seems like a good time to buy some of the best e-commerce stocks for the long term. CPNG stock looks attractive for multibagger returns in the next five years. For Q3 2023, Coupang reported net revenue of $6.2 billion that was higher by 21% on a year-on-year basis. For the same period, the EBITDA was $239 million with an EBITDA margin of 3.9%. An important point to note is that for trailing-twelve-months, Coupang reported free cash flow of $1.9 billion. The bottom-line for valuation is FCF and I expect cash flows to swell further on operating leverage. My view is underscored by the point that the Company expects “ [consolidated margin](https://s27.q4cdn.com/765243554/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/Q3-2023-Earnings-Release_Final.pdf) to continue its march upwards on an annual basis.” Further, [active customer growth](https://s27.q4cdn.com/765243554/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/3Q23-Earnings-Presentation_Final.pdf) has been healthy on a year-on-year basis. With multiple positive business metrics, I am bullish on CPNG stock. Miniso Group (MNSO) Moving from e-commerce to the brick-and-mortar model, Miniso (NYSE: [MNSO](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mnso-stock-quote/)) is a lifestyle retailer that’s worth holding for the next few years. With global presence, Miniso has a big addressable market. Further, with an attractive pricing and a dynamic product portfolio, the Company has been successful in attracting consumers. For Q1 2024, Miniso reported revenue growth of 36.7% on a year-on-year basis to $519.6 million. For the same period, [adjusted EBITDA increased by 52.8%](https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_miniso/286/MNSO-930ER-24Q1.pdf) on a year-on-year basis to $139 million. I expect robust growth to sustain on the back of higher revenue per customer coupled with aggressive store expansion. As of Q1 2024, Miniso reported 6,115 stores globally. On a year-on-year basis, the number of stores increased by 819. With an asset-light model, EBITDA margin is likely to remain healthy. I must add that Miniso initiated dividends this year. It’s likely that dividend growth will be robust considering the current growth momentum.

The polar vortex is a large area of low-pressure and cold air that typically swirls around the Earth's poles, particularly the North Pole. unbranded - Newsworthy It might finally be time to drip faucets and bundle up as an arctic cold front makes its way to Oklahoma.\nThe first cold snap of 2025 will arrive Saturday night or Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in Norman . Forecasters aren't yet sure whether central Oklahoma will get wintry precipitation, but there is a better chance for snow in Kansas and far northern Oklahoma.\nOklahoma's cold season has been dampened so far by the La Niña weather pattern that creates a warmer and drier winter in this part of the country.\nBelow-normal temperatures arrive Sunday While nighttime temps have recently dipped below freezing, this cold front will be different.\nStarting Sunday evening, the air temperature will reach into the teens for the foreseeable future. The daily high temp in Oklahoma City will hover around the freezing mark. Both are below the seasonal average.\nMuch colder air is expected to pour into the region on Sunday resulting in steady/falling temperatures through the day. By Monday morning, wind chills will be in the single digits and teens.

The forecast released Thursday morning indicates that snow will be possible in northern Oklahoma, with the potential for a light accumulations of snow. Other parts of the state could see rain showers.\nHow long will the cold snap last? The latest forecast issued Thursday morning says there is a wide variation in the computer models used to predict long-term weather.\nLow temperatures are still expected to be in the teens and low 20s through Tuesday, with highs reaching in the 40s. However, a few other shots of cold air could slow Oklahoma's chances of warming up, the forecast noted.\nThis cold snap will be the coldest so far this winter season and the coldest overnight temperatures the Oklahoma City area has seen in nearly a year. The last time the temp dropped below 20 was in mid-January 2024, according to the Oklahoma Mesonet .\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

Desalojan decenas de poblaciones del sureste de Australia por incendios forestales [Leer más](/actualidad/mundo/desalojan-decenas-poblaciones-sureste-australia-incendios-forestales-190603) El obispo Christopher Saunders, quien renunció a su cargo en 2020 -año en el que las primeras denuncias salieron a la luz y tras casi medio siglo al servicio de la Iglesia católica- fue arrestado la víspera en su vivienda en la ciudad de Broome, en el noroeste del país, según un comunicado de la Policía del estado de Australia Occidental, publicado anoche. Saunders ha sido acusado de dos delitos de penetración sexual sin consentimiento, catorce de asalto ilegal indecente y tres de gestión indecente por parte de una persona con autoridad de un menor de entre 16 y 18 años, agrega la nota. Este jueves, el abogado del clérigo se declaró no culpable de los cargos al comparecer ante un tribunal de magistrados de Broome, según informó la cadena pública australiana ABC. El obispo retirado fue enseguida puesto en libertad tras el pago de una fianza de 10.000 dólares australianos (6.567 dólares estadounidenses o 6.060 euros) y deberá comparecer nuevamente ante la corte en junio próximo, agregó la ABC. Saunders, de 74 años y quien asumió el cargo de obispo de Broome en 1995, ha estado bajo sospecha desde 2020, cuando salieron a la luz una serie de acusaciones por conducta sexual inapropiada. Migrar a Australia: una charla para ecuatorianos que quieran intentarlo [Leer más](/actualidad/migrar-australia-ecuatorianos-recibiran-charlas-informativas-189882) Las autoridades australianas comenzaron entonces a investigar ese mismo año las denuncias, pero poco después la Fiscalía de Australia Occidental cerró el caso sin formular cargos, según ABC. El caso volvió a cobrar importancia el pasado septiembre, cuando los medios australianos filtraron partes de un informe realizado por el Vaticano que indicó que se sospecha que Saunders asaltó sexualmente a cuatro adolescentes y a un número indeterminado de varones. El documento igualmente reveló sospechas de que el ahora exobispo potencialmente sedujo a otros 67 jóvenes y usó fondos de la Iglesia para comprar alcohol para los jóvenes aborígenes mientras ocupaba cargos de autoridad. En 2012, el Gobierno australiano creó una comisión para investigar la respuesta de las instituciones públicas, religiosas, sociales, comunitarias y deportivas desde la década de 1950 a las denuncias de pederastia contra decenas de miles de menores. Tras cinco años de investigaciones, la comisión constató que estos casos constituyeron una \"tragedia nacional\" y ordenó una serie de indemnizaciones. Australia reporta un muerto y evalúa daños por clima extremo en sur del país [Leer más](/actualidad/mundo/australia-reporta-muerto-evalua-danos-clima-extremo-sur-pais-189657) En el ojo del huracán de estas investigaciones estuvo la Iglesia católica australiana, donde unos 1.900 sacerdotes, curas y otros de sus miembros, entre ellos 93 altos cargos, fueron vinculados a unas 4.500 denuncias de abusos sexuales contra menores entre 1980 y 2015. Una de las figuras más prominentes de la Iglesia católica de Australia que afrontó acusaciones por abuso sexuales a menores en la década de 1990 fue el fallecido cardenal George Pell, el ex número tres del Vaticano. Pell fue condenado en 2018 y posteriormente absuelto en 2020 por el Tribunal Superior del país, después de que pasara 13 meses en prisión. ¿Quieres acceder a todo el contenido de calidad sin límites?

The snow will “circle” the mountains and the peaks of the mountains, and Parnitha and Penteli may see ​the first ​snow.\nSpecifically, on Saturday, ​on one side of the⁤ country we will have northern weather, according to ‌the forecast‍ of ​Clearchos ⁣Marousakis, and in​ the weakest phenomena further east on the continent. In the rest of the country the weather will start with a mild mood towards the afternoon, but a barometric low is approaching which will bring rain and storms first ⁣in the north-west.\nOn Sunday this severe weather system will​ affect almost the whole country and a fast route from​ the ‌north-west to the south-east.\nThe ​storms will be mainly ‌focused on the sea and⁢ we will first have snow in the mountains of the northern⁢ mainland and on Monday the ‍snow⁣ will fall a little further south in the mountainous areas⁣ of the mountainous central country near Pelion, Arachova , Kalavrita and a little further ⁣south in the Peloponnese.\nSome mountains⁢ in Crete will also see snow as this wave moves further‌ south and slowly starts to move away.\nIn Attica on ​Sunday we will have rain, especially in the Saronikos,⁤ and some snowfall can be⁢ seen on the⁣ heights ⁤of Parnitha.\nLIVE‌ the evolution of time Tsatraphyllias: ‌”winter identification visit” Meteorologist Giorgos Tsatrafillias⁢ talks about the “winter ⁣reading ‌tour”.\nAs he highlighted​ in his post on Saturday, the new aspect of the development of the weather is the strong easterlies in the south in the Ionian and the local storms from noon and then in the west and on Sunday ⁢in‌ the eastern Aegean and the Dodecanese .\n“S/K ⁣and on Monday we ⁤expect it to rain in other regions as well, such as Macedonia, Thessaly, the Cyclades and Crete. On Monday it will ⁢also rain a​ little in Attica. Though, the temperature drop‌ (6-8 degrees) will be ⁢noticeable ‍on Sunday and Monday. It‌ will‌ also bring snow in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas in⁢ central ‍and northern Greece.⁢ From Tuesday the temperature rises again. I should emphasize that‍ the above phenomena will not ​be particularly ‍severe. states.\nTiraski: Rain and storms Saturday ‌and Sunday On the same wavelength⁣ as the meteorologist Anastasia tyraski, according ‌to which there ‍will be ⁢some rain in the west of Greece, and as ​the hours go by there will also be storms.\nHe specifically says that on Saturday the‍ weather is‌ predicted‌ to change in western Greece, as⁣ the winds will turn to the south which will reach the Ionian Sea at ⁢6‍ to⁢ 7 Beaufort and there will be rain ‍and storms sporadic ‌there, which will gradually​ affect ‍the south side. in the center and north of the country.\nOn Sunday, ​the barometric low will affect the rest of the ​country with rain in ​some areas and storms mainly in the Aegean. On⁤ Monday the rain will weaken and gradually be limited ‍to crete,the winds will turn⁤ to the north which will reach 8 Beaufort and the temperature will drop significantly. However, the cold ‌will not last long, because from Tuesday summer is⁤ predicted ‍again and the temperature will rise.\nThe weather today Today, northern weather will prevail in our country. We will be ⁤strengthened from ⁤the north ⁣in​ the Aegean and on the eastern mainland, which will drop the temperature​ and bring light rain generally in ⁤the eastern ⁤parts of the continent towards⁢ the north of Crete ⁤and‍ the eastern Aegean.\nThe country is divided into two parts on one side. In the Pindos mountain range, northerly weather⁢ will prevail, while further ⁣west there will be⁤ sunshine and light winds. The temperatures have dropped and are starting at⁣ zero degrees.\nIn Attica, sunlight will affect until midday. Later‌ we will have a passage with clouds that will not exclude light⁢ rain near the evening in ‍the​ areas ​near Penteli and Parnitha.

It’s great to be here.\nanna: So, we’re moving from ⁣spring ​to⁣ winter in⁢ quite a dramatic fashion! Can you explain what we can expect​ in the coming days regarding the weather?\nGiorgos: ​ Absolutely! We’re‌ entering a period marked by severe weather conditions.⁤ Over the‍ next few days, heavy storms and snow are expected to sweep ​across the country. This weather system is quite important, as it⁤ will affect almost‌ every region in various ways.\nanna: Intriguing! I understand that the mountains will play​ a ⁤key role in this weather pattern. Can you elaborate ‍on that?\nGiorgos: Yes, indeed! The ⁢snow is ⁣predicted to “circle” ⁤the mountain ranges.We might see the first flakes fall on⁢ Parnitha and Penteli as early as Saturday.By Sunday, we can expect‌ more extensive snow accumulation in the northern mainland,‌ with areas like Pelion, Arachova, and Kalavrita likely to experience snowfall ⁤as well.⁣ Even the mountainous regions in crete aren’t exempt ‌from this wintery weather.\nAnna: That sounds quite transformative.

Meanwhile, those in Attica should prepare for rain, especially in the ‍Saronikos, with potential ⁤snowfall at higher elevations. It’s essential for everyone⁣ to stay alert to the changing conditions and to⁣ heed any weather warnings.\nAnna: There ​seems to be a mix⁢ of weather phenomena occurring simultaneously. Why ⁢is that?\nGiorgos: ‍The interaction of different‍ weather systems plays a ​crucial role. We’re seeing strong easterlies in the‍ south, combined with ⁢a barometric ‍low approaching from the northwest.This combination creates diverse weather effects,transitioning from mild conditions to more‍ severe systems quite rapidly.\nAnna: It sounds like ​a bit‍ of a ‍rollercoaster! As a ⁣meteorologist, what strategies do ⁣you recommend for ⁤individuals and communities to stay safe during this weather upheaval?\nGiorgos: First and foremost, ⁤it’s vital to ⁢stay informed. Peopel⁣ should keep an ⁤eye on local weather forecasts, especially as the ⁢storm ⁢develops.​ emergency kits with essentials like food, ⁤water, and​ warmth ‍are good to have prepared. avoiding unnecessary travel during⁣ peak storm times is crucial for ‌personal safety.\nAnna: ⁤ Excellent advice! Before we⁣ wrap ⁢up, do you ​have any​ closing thoughts about this weather ​shift?\nGiorgos: ⁣Just to ⁤reiterate the importance of being proactive. Understanding weather patterns ‍and being prepared can​ make a significant difference during such events. As we transition from lush spring ⁣to a stormy winter, ⁢let’s embrace the⁣ changes while prioritizing safety.\nAnna: Thank you, Giorgos, for your insightful viewpoint on the impending weather and⁢ for sharing⁢ your expertise with us today.\nGiorgos: My pleasure, Anna. Let’s ⁤keep everyone safe and informed!\nAnna: ‌And​ thank you to our ​viewers‌ for tuning in. Stay safe ‌and weather-ready as we experience⁢ this⁢ dramatic ​shift in seasons. Until next time!",
