    "text": "STORRS — Maybe “spoiled” is too strong a word. Then again, maybe it’s not. We do take certain levels of excellence for granted when it comes to UConn women’s basketball.\nA 25-5 record ? Sure, but what about the five losses to highly-ranked teams? Another unbeaten record in Big East conference play? Another trophy for a regular season title may be ho-hum for some, though freshman KK Arnold carried the trophy around until her arms got tired after the victory over Villanova on Tuesday night. The Huskies went to the Final Four some 14 years in a row, but a loss in the Sweet 16 a year ago to Ohio State, to some observers, signifies a dynasty in decline.\nAll of this is a bit unreasonable, but we’re talking about mainstream sports here and the fair-weather nature of those who live and die with this successful a program comes with that territory.\nUConn women’s basketball runs past Villanova 67-46 as Paige Bueckers logs another 31 points\nBut some things should not be so easily written off as baseline achievements. As UConn athletics honored its top students across all sports at halftime of the last women’s home game of the season, the 67-46 victory over Villanova , nearly every member of Geno Auriemma’s team was called out for academic success, a 3.0 grade-point average for the fall semester.\n“It’s just the culture we have here at UConn,” said Paige Bueckers, majoring in human development and family sciences. “We demand excellence in everything we do, to prepare us that way to be professionals on the court, off the court. It’s just what is expected of us and we all take pride in school so it’s easy for us to demand that of ourselves.”\nBueckers, Nika Muhl, Aaliyah Edwards , Azzi Fudd, Caroline Ducharme, Amari DeBerry, Ines Bettencourt, Jana El Alfy, Ashlynn Shade, KK Arnold and Qaudence Samuels all achieved grade-point averages of 3.0 or higher during the fall semester. You know their basketball stories. Some are seniors, some are freshmen away from home for the first time; some have come from overseas; some play nearly every minute of every game, and have a lot of name-image-likeness deals that demand time; some play rarely; some have been recovering from major injuries, but all have this in common.\n“I think it’s quite an accomplishment, when you go to college and you play basketball or any other major sport with all the demands on it and you’re still able to have the same level of success, some kids even more so, in the classroom,” coach Geno Auriemma said, “That means a lot to me and to our program. It’s a promise you make to their parents and you want to deliver on it.”\nThe men’s program had its share called out, too —. Alex Karaban, Cam Spencer, two of the Huskies’ stars, Apostolos Roumoglou, sophomore from Greece, and walk-ons Andrew Hurley and Andre Johnson. These are kids who often play night games halfway across the country, and if you’ve flown a lot you know how much it can sap your energy, but there’s no day to recover from jet lag, just morning classes, followed most days, by afternoon practices.\nPaige Bueckers. There’s no one like her.\n– 31 points\n– 11-15 FG\n– 2-4 3FG\n– 7-7 FT pic.twitter.com/L8hdz3ouub\n— UConn Women’s Basketball (@UConnWBB) February 29, 2024\n“The fact they put so much time and effort into it, given the travel schedule and everything else, says a lot about them as individuals, that their priorities are in order,” Auriemma said.\nFull disclosure here: I wasn’t the most studious of undergrads. I focused on what I wanted to be, worked to pay my tuition and gain journalism experience and didn’t quite maintain a 3.0. And I was on the five-year plan. So maybe I make too much of this, but I also consider it quite an accomplishment for young people to meet the physical and mental demands of playing college basketball in a fishbowl, this “basketball capital of the world,” meet them well enough for a combined 32-2 record in the Big East, and also maintain good grades, graduate in four years. Heck, Fudd, rehabbing from major knee surgery, is on pace to graduate in three years, then plans to go for an MBA.\n“It (takes) extreme focus on time management and maximizing our free times and off days,” Bueckers said. “Getting work done on those days so practice days and full class days aren’t as loaded.”\nFree time and off days are, in this case, relative terms. It’s safe to say they must sacrifice many of the fun activities associated with college to do all they do. Auriemma seeks and chooses players willing to pay the price to fulfil their scholarships without excuses. The UConn women were one of nine teams on campus with a 100 percent graduation rate in the data released in December .\n“We’ve always take great pride in what we do on and off the court, since day one when we got here,” Auriemma said. “( Associate head coach Chris Dailey ) and I sat down and we said ‘this is how we’re going to do things.’ and we haven’t wavered, we haven’t changed one bit from 1985. So there may be some kids we don’t recruit, or some we should have recruited, but if you’re coming to play basketball at the University of Connecticut and you’re not committed to what’s happening the rest of your day, if academics aren’t important to you personally, to your family and you don’t take it personally and make it a no.1 priority, then you’re not going to last here generally speaking. First, we’re going to try not to take somebody like that and, second, when you do get there we’re going to do everything we can to help you and then you’ve got to do the rest.”\nArnold remembered how much the academic end was emphasized when UConn recruited her from Wisconsin and like the other true freshman, Shade and Samuels, she’s off to a good start.\n“It was a big thing (in recruiting),” Arnold said. “Meeting with our academic advisor that was a big emphasis in how much time we’d be spending off the court. Having study hall after practices or when we come back from road trips, it helps us in terms of studying during the day if we have a game. Those things helped the whole freshman group as far as us adjusting to the college level.”\nAs UConn women celebrate Pride Night, Morgan Valley reflects on LGBTQ inclusion as a player and coach\nWhen Auriemma and Dailey began to build their program, the dual-sided academic and athletic culture, it was the only way to go. There was no women’s professional basketball, and even after the WNBA started , the pay was low. There are more opportunities for women to play basketball for pay, in the U.S. and overseas today, and it would be easy for the best players to just get by academically, and major in basketball. At UConn, at least, that doesn’t happen and for that, no season, certainly no career should have to end in a national championship to avoid being called a failure.\n“We’re student athletes,” Edwards said emphatically, “and we excel on the court and off the court.”\nDom Amore’s Sunday Read: Meet Cherif Diarra, youngest brother of a CT college hoop family; UConn’s Azzi Fudd takes the mic; Dan Hurley, crowd control and more",

    "text": "CATLETTSBURG A 39-year-old man pleaded guilty on Thursday to multiple charges after throwing the contents of his colostomy bag at hospital workers last summer. Joshua A. Potter, of an unknown address, was jailed following the incident at the King’s Daughters emergency department in early July for reportedly attacking hospital workers with feces after ripping open his own colostomy bag, per previous reports. Potter was indicted shortly thereafter on charges of third-degree assault on medical personnel, third-degree criminal mischief, trespassing and public intoxication. On Thursday, Potter appeared via video conference from the Boyd County Detention Center to enter a guilty plea alongside his attorney, Whitney Davis. Boyd Circuit Judge John Vincent said he was “particularly interested” in the details surrounding the third-degree assault charge before accepting the settled plea agreement between prosecutors and Davis. “Well ...” Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Kierston Rosen began before elaborating on the allegations against Potter. Rosen said Potter attempted to throw “fecal matter” at hospital employees but added, “thankfully,” no worker was hit by Potter’s colostomy contents. In exchange for Potter’s admissions to third-degree assault, public intoxication and third-degree criminal mischief, the Commonwealth proposed to dismiss his charge of trespassing. With the narrowly missed victims’ and law enforcement’s approval, Vincent accepted the plea arrangement and sentenced Potter according to the Commonwealth’s suggestion. Potter was sentenced to 90 days in jail for both public intoxication and criminal mischief (the maximum for both charges) and five years for third-degree assault on medical personnel. In accordance with his plea arrangement, Potter will serve 180 days in jail and the remaining balance of the five-year sentence will be served under supervised probation. One of the terms of his probation is to abide by Vincent’s order to stay away from all KDMC properties, unless in a “dire medical emergency.” Vincent said if Potter violates any probation condition or trespasses on KDMC property, his probation could be revoked — meaning the five-year sentence would be served behind bars.",

Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Cody Bellinger's free agency is starting to ramp up after the signings of Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Teams have shifted their interest in the former National League MVP in recent days.\nOne team that MLB insider Jon Heyman believes to be the favorite to land Bellinger is the Chicago Cubs. They have not done much as an organization this offseason besides adding Craig Counsell as manager.\nExpand Tweet •\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Bellinger spent the 2023 season in Chicago and had a re-surging year. He appeared in 130 games, hitting .307/.356/.525 with 26 home runs, 97 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases. He did this all in a contract year, which is impressive.\nThe Cubs are looking for offense this winter, and Cody Bellinger was one of the most intriguing offensive players last season. If Chicago believes he has found himself again and is willing to spend the money, he would be a great re-signing.\nAll signs are pointing to Cody Bellinger rejoining the Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates v Chicago Cubs Cody Bellinger is the top-rated positional player on the open market. He is coming off a year where he bet on himself and had fantastic results with the Cubs for the 2023 season.\nChicago has exciting players like Christopher Morel and Pete Crow Armstrong. They should have an excellent opportunity to make a noise in the National League Central.\nThere is no denying that Bellinger was the team's best player last season. That is something they likely will not want to give up. However, they must dish out big-time money to re-sign the slugger. He is expected to receive a contract upwards of $200 million.\nExpand Tweet With the Toronto Blue Jays signing Kevin Kiermaier just days ago, all signs lead to Bellinger staying with the Cubs. This would be Chicago's biggest offseason signing if they were to make a deal with Bellinger.\nClick here for 2023 MLB Free Agency Tracker Updates.

La Consejería de Familias de la Junta de Andalucía ha explicado que los padres adoptivos tienen la «guarda con fines de adopción», esto es, «de forma provisional» la tendrán en adopción seis meses para luego, siguiendo todos los cauces legales y protocolos, «llegar a la adopción definitiva». Este pasado jueves, la niña y sus padres adoptivos abandonaron las instalaciones del Hospital de Valme de Sevilla capital, donde ha permanecido ingresada desde que hace diez días fuera encontrada por una vecina cuando se disponía a tirar la basura. En una primera exploración a la bebé, que fue hallada desnuda, dentro de una bolsa de plástico y envuelta en sangre, se encontraron restos de sustancias tóxicas en su organismo -tal y como informó Diario de Sevilla-, por lo que la Guardia Civil ha centrado la búsqueda de la madre entre las toxicómanas de este municipio sevillano de 38.000 habitantes. La consejera andaluza de Familias, Loles López, ya aludió, además de a los síntomas de hipotermia, a «otras cuestiones» que afloraron en el reconocimiento médico al que fue sometido la pequeña, si bien no detalló ese «algo más» por motivos de confidencialidad. Antonia, la [vecina](https://okdiario.com/andalucia/vecina-que-hallo-bebe-contenedor-palacios-si-va-adoptar-alguien-adopto-yo-12095317) de 62 años que encontró a la niña, se mostró dispuesta a adoptarla cuanto antes, interesándose incluso por los trámites a realizar en el mismo lugar de los hechos: «Si la va a adoptar alguien, la adopto yo», aseveró. La mujer escuchó algo parecido al «maullido de un gato» cuando abrió el contenedor para tirar la basura, pero era una recién nacida: «Se le veía las piernecitas por fuera de la bolsa y el cordón umbilical». Con la ayuda de otra vecina, la taparon con una manta hasta la llegada de los servicios sanitarios de emergencia. «Un rato más y muere de frío o asfixiada en la bolsa de plástico», apuntaron los agentes de la Guardia Civil nada más llegar. Posteriormente fue llevada al centro de salud de Los Palacios y, de ahí, trasladada al hospital. Horas después de ser localizada, la primera teniente de alcalde y delegada de Bienestar Social del Ayuntamiento de Los Palacios y Villafranca, Carmen María Molina, adelantaba que la pequeña que se llamaría Nieves en honor a la patrona del municipio y en alusión el frío que hacía la tarde-noche en la que fue hallada gracias a su llanto. «Está estable y es muy bonita. No le van a faltar abrazos, caricias y sonrisas para estos primeros días de vida en el hospital», reconocía entre lágrimas. Entretanto, la Policía Judicial sigue buscando a la familia biológica de la pequeña. Por un lado, se extrajo ADN de la menor para obtener información genética de la madre y cotejarla con las bases de datos. Por otro, se inició una búsqueda de «candidatas» en los registros de atención a embarazos, siempre y cuando la madre hubiese acudido a un médico en algún momento entre abril (lo que se entiende como el primer mes de embarazo) y el 18 de diciembre, día del parto, ya que, inicialmente, todos los percentiles de peso y talla de la niña indicaronn que la gestación se prolongó durante más de ocho meses.",

    "text": "HOUSTON, March 12 (Reuters) - TerraPower, the new nuclear power company backed by Bill Gates, is interested in expanding into Texas, an executive said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston on Wednesday.\nTerraPower began construction of its first small modular reactor in Wyoming last year, aiming to usher in a next generation of nuclear plants to meet growing global power demand from the proliferation of data centers and the electrification of sectors like transportation.\n\"We would like to put a flagpole down here,\" said Jeffrey Miller, vice president of business development at TerraPower, in response to an invitation to do business in the Lone Star state by Texas Public Utility Commissioner Jimmy Glotfelty.\n\"We are very bullish on Texas,\" said Miller, who added that he was interested in moving into the state in some capacity this year.\nIt was unclear what type of expansion into Texas TerraPower was considering. The state is trying to create incentives to build new reactors.

    "text": "As winter tightens its grip on Bangladesh, biting cold and dense fog are taking a toll, particularly on children, the elderly, and outdoor workers. The chill is particularly severe in the northern regions, with Tetulia in Panchagarh district recording the lowest temperature of 8.3°C at 9am today (3 January), according to Md Rokanuzzaman, an observer at the Tetulia Weather Observatory Centre. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) issued a forecast of a mild cold wave sweeping across the northern region, including Rangpur, Rajshahi, Pabna, Bogura, Naogaon, and Kushtia. In Dhaka, with temperatures dipping and no sun in sight throughout the day, residents endured cold winds and damp roads. Despite it being a weekly holiday, few people ventured outside. Vehicles were seen driving with headlights on, and the damp roads remained wet with dew throughout the day. The meteorological office in a notice today said the ongoing weather conditions will continue for the next few days but the day and night temperatures will rise slightly till tomorrow evening. During this time, dense fog will remain across the country from midnight till the morning, which may hamper air, riverine and road transport, the notice said. The minimum temperature recorded in the capital was 13.6°C and maximum was 17.5°C in 24 hours till 6pm today. Hospitals under pressure Due to the cold, the crowd of people suffering from cold-related diseases has increased in hospitals across the country.
