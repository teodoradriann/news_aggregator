Los primeros pozos N° 17 y N° 18 fueron activados en la urbanización Valle Alto I y II de Ocumare.\nCalificó esta infraestructura como extraordinaria, ya que mejora la atención médica que presta todos los días este hospital; a su vez recordó que recientemente fueron entregadas las obras de recuperación del laboratorio y meses atrás también se abrió la sala de emergencias de este centro asistencial.",

    "title": "How and When to Watch 'Star Trek: Section 31'",
    "text": "The Star Trek franchise has stood the test of time, spanning almost 60 years, 11 spin-off television series, and two very popular film franchises. The newest film spin-off, Star Trek: Section 31, is set to premiere on the streaming service Paramount+ on January 24th, 2025. This new iteration of Star Trek stars Michelle Yeoh as Philippa Georgiou, a character from the Mirror Universe who ran the Terran Empire as she travels to the main universe and joins a division of Starfleet. Fans of the franchise might be wondering where and when to watch this new spin-off, a question that this article will answer for them.\nHow and When to Watch \"Star Trek: Section 31\"\nStar Trek: Section 31 will be premiering on January 24th, 2025 through the Paramount+ streaming service at 3 AM Eastern and 12 AM Pacific time in the United States. It is also slated to premiere on the same date, January 24th, for German, Australian and Canadian audiences. In the US, it will only be available on the Paramount+ website or app for subscribers, or for purchase from third-party apps such as Vudu.\nAlthough it will be premiering on the 24th for viewers, there have already been some early screenings for critics, press, and the lucky few fans who were able to be in New York or London at the right time. Early reviews weren't promising, with most feeling that this new show is a fairly standard take on the Star Trek universe and science fiction in general with very little new or interesting to offer, while a few hopeful fans seemed to view it as a possibly exciting new entry for the franchise. Only time will tell which opinion will win out with audiences.\nWhat Is 'Star Trek: Section 31' About?\nStar Trek: 31 tells the story of a secret division within the Starfleet organization known as Section 31 – a group in charge of protecting the United Federation of Planets through any means necessary, even unauthorized or illegal means. They are the division of Starfleet that is sent in when regular methods won’t do, and when Starfleet needs to be able to send in a group that can do what needs to be done without rules or regulations.\nThis division, and the cast, are led by Michelle Yeoh’s Philippa Georgiou, a character from the Mirror Universe who was introduced in another spin-off show, Star Trek: Discovery. When the audience catches up with Georgiou in this new show, she has left the Mirror Universe and is now in a new part of the Star Trek timeline where she owns a nightclub outside of Federation space called the Baraam.\nIt’s clear from the marketing of the show that Philippa Georgiou is going to be a large part of the focus of the show, and might be the main draw for audiences tuning in. With so much focus being on the character and on Michelle Yeoh heading up the cast, anyone who is unfamiliar with her character from Star Trek: Discovery might be left wondering who she is and how she fits into the Star Trek Universe.\nRelated\n10 Classic 'Star Trek' Storylines That Would Be Perfect for 'Star Trek 4'\nThese episodes from across the 'Star Trek' franchise could form a great basis for the long-in-development 'Star Trek 4.'\nWho is Philippa Georgiou?\nIntroduced in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Discovery, the original Captain Georgiou is the leader of the USS Shenzhou. It’s clear from the very beginning that the crew on her ship think highly of her and that she is a respected and beloved captain. Partway through the first season, in the 11th episode, a different version of Philippa Georgiou is introduced – a version of her from the Mirror Universe, a universe parallel to but separate from the main one featured in Star Trek, who is depicted as the ruthless emperor of the Terran Empire.\nShe appeared periodically throughout the rest of the series, with her final appearance being in the tenth episode of season 3. Although she shows character growth throughout the series, by her last episode she is still a very different version of Philippa than Captain Georgiou of the main timeline.\nThis version of Georgiou is, in many ways, the opposite of the version from the main universe. She is a much harsher character, one who is depicted as callous and driven to the point of being cruel. This is the Philippa Georgiou audiences can expect to see in the new Star Trek show, or at least some version of her. Yeoh herself has said that she hopes that this Philippa won’t lose her edge, even if she was shown learning more compassion in later episodes of Star Trek: Discovery.\nRelated\n5 Reasons J.J. Abrams' 'Star Trek' Might Be Cinema's Greatest Reboot\nFifteen years later, J.J. Abram's 'Star Trek' is one of the best films in the franchise and what every franchise reboot should strive for.\nIt is this character’s edge that, theoretically, will make watching her lead a Starfleet division trying to protect people so compelling. Her relationships with the other members of Section 31 and interactions with those she is tasked with protecting have a lot of potential for a fascinating movie – the only question is whether or not the show will live up to that potential.\nWhat 'Star Trek: Section 31' Could Mean for the Star Trek Franchise\nAlthough this is just one movie entry in the history of a long and varied franchise, the future of the Star Trek universe could be greatly affected depending on how this movie does. If it does well, drawing in large viewership numbers and positive responses, then that could mean a sequel for this movie as well as further exploration of Section 31 and the members of this secret Starfleet group. If it doesn’t do well, then the franchise is likely to pivot to other storylines and characters within the universe – leaving Philippa Georgiou and hew crew of misfits in Section 31 forgotten.",

    "text": "Evil practices in our midst committed by foreigners (in collusion with locals?), have been given different names—human trafficking, forced labor, abduction, kidnapping, prostitution, drugs, illegal gambling—but hardly has the S word been used as if it were so passé, so Old World.\nNowadays, I hardly hear the term “white slavery” being used, which refers to prostituted women being held against their will. Has it segued into a bigger, all-encompassing category which is simply slavery in all its forms?\nSlavery, as defined in our times, has become part of present-day underground crimes committed by foreigners, Chinese nationals particularly, who have been allowed in to operate brazenly to boost government earnings. Their practices have been under the radar for as long as they could stay that way in local government units—with public officials and citizens looking the other way—until a foul odor leaked and red flags were raised.\nHow have we come to this?\nFEATURED STORIES OPINION View to an ‘overkill OPINION Advice from opthalmologist: Don’t commit these mistakes OPINION Questioning myself Well, it all started during the China-smitten Duterte presidency. Allow me a retching emoticon here. Modern slavery, as defined by Anti-Slavery International, is “when an individual is exploited by others, for personal or commercial gain. Whether tricked, coerced, or forced, they lose their freedom. This includes but is not limited to human trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage.”\nAccording to Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.” There are different types of slavery but there is not enough space to discuss them here. Article 272 (Slavery) of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines imposes the penalty of prision mayor and a fine on “anyone who shall purchase, sell, kidnap, or detain a human being for the purpose of enslaving him.”\nSlavery is not a thing of the past, notes the antislavery movement, because almost 50 million people worldwide are trapped in slave-like conditions. Slavery in the present times may not look like the slave trade of old when thousands of people, mostly from Africa, were abducted en masse and loaded onto slave ships, to be taken to colonized countries for slave traders to sell like cattle to the highest bidders. We learned about this in history books, novels, and movies.\nThe most gripping slavery movie I’ve seen was Steven Spielberg’s “Amistad” about the slaves in the slave ship named “friendship” or amistad in Spanish. (I watched it twice and wrote a review of it.) Remember the TV series “Roots” based on the “faction” novel by Alex Haley? We all know that American media mogul Oprah Winfrey is herself a descendant of slaves. The writer of “Amazing Grace” was a repentant slave trader turned minister.\nADVERTISEMENT I leave it to historians to say whether or not slavery, as presently defined, existed in pre-colonial Philippines from where came the terms aliping sagigilid, ulipon, uripon, etc.\nThe main culprit in the crime saga now unfolding in our midst would be the Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) under Chinese nationals, some of which were raided by law enforcers recently. These Pogos, along with other connected facilities, are situated in big tracts of land that are transformed into mini-townships operating under the noses of local officials who had given them permits to operate.\nADVERTISEMENT Such was the case of Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo, 38, whose Filipino citizenship was scrutinized repeatedly in Senate hearings and who could not remember a vast chunk of her mysterious childhood. She is now dubbed “Amnesia Girl” in social media whose tale could be a plot for a spy novella. Discovered in the huge Pogo estate adjacent to her mayor’s office were goings-on that would keep the Department of Justice and the Office of the Ombudsman busy, from tax evasion cases to forced labor to …\nBusy, too, are social media punsters, jokesters, meme-ers, and TikTok-ers who are without mercy in their department. Last week’s raid of the Pogo complex in Porac, Pampanga yielded evidence of tortured individuals of various citizenships, and what looked like military uniforms of China’s People’s Liberation Army. Behold a man chained to a post and left behind by his escaped abductors, his face and torso bearing proof of severe beating. Who brought him and others like him to the Philippines? How did they get through immigration? Where are his Filipino counterparts?\nThe Bamban and Porac Pogos are the tip of a huge iceberg. While a variety of illegal activities may be going on, I am particularly alarmed by how slavery has become part of the Pogo operations implanted in our landscape. An un-bylined sober statement being shared on social media is calling for the “immediate closure” of all Pogos. Their supposed advantages of increased revenues and employment are insignificant compared to the social ills they have wrought, slavery among them, in our midst.

    "text": "News Corp Australia Network\nTech guru Scott Farquhar set a mind-blowing new Australian house price record when he settled on his new trophy home.\nThe Atlassian co-founder generally keeps something of a lower profile than his former business partner Mike Cannon-Brookes (co-owner of NRL side the Rabbitohs and NBA side Utah Jazz) but Farquhar drew headlines across the country when he splurged $130m on Uig Lodge in July last year.\nAnd then\npaid in cash.\nMORE:\nUntold secrets of Australia’s only $200m home\nUig Lodge dates back to 1900 and sits atop the richest postcode in Australia, Point Piper in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs. A locale Ex-PM Malcolm ‘Mr Harbourside Mansion’ Turnbull and mortgage guru John Symonds call home and where billionaires such as Bill Gates choose to stay when they visit Australia.\nSuffice to say\nPoint Piper, which is bordered by Sydney Harbour on three sides, is a tightly held suburb and PropTrack doesn’t have a current median house price.\nIt’s one of those – if you have to ask how much, you can’t afford it – type of scenarios.\nUig Lodge’s $130m price tag blew Cannon-Brookes’ harbourside pile Fairwater ($100m) out of the water as the highest price paid for an Australian home.\nMORE:\nBloody truth of Australia’s most expensive house\nAnd while Farquhar will likely make plenty on the property given its location, the home itself didn’t find it’s way onto our\nTop 50 Homes list.\nFarquhar’s choice of expensive homes has been questioned before, when he dropped around $73m on nearby Elaine, which sits next to Fairwater and is a short golf cart ride from Uig Lodge.\n‘I’ve been inside the $73 million Elaine, and quite frankly — it’s ugly’ the headline on that house’s story read.\nWe would struggle to be that harsh on a $130m house and wouldn’t knock it back if it were offered but Uig Lodge doesn’t exactly tick the boxes for the ultimate in lifestyle living for 2023.\nMORE:\nDad’s simple bank, tax tricks net him $390k a year\nBuilt in the style of a Scottish baronial castle, Uig Lodge might be perfect if the temp never troubles more than 15 degrees celsius and in the depths of winter you have servants to man the fireplaces and wolfhounds to keep you safe and sound.\nBut this is Australia 2024.\nAnd in our homes, we very much want to embrace outdoor living, we want homes that flow from the front door to the pool, not ones that have us cooped up in the drawing room.\nAs a comparison, fellow tech guru Leon Kamenev, who founded Menulog has much more of the right idea for contemporary living. And his home features very highly on our list of the\n Top 50 Homes.\nKamenev spent around $70m on three lots of land in Vaucluse, another big name prestige suburb in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs and then spent two years and $30m on the build.\nThe result? A home for the ages, or to be more precise this age.\nMORE:\nHow dropout turned $38k salary into $43m\nPictures of Kamenev’s pad were released as part of the Master Builders Association NSW awards of 2023.\nIn the Excellence in State Awards, builder Pimas Gale won in the category for Housing (Residential): Contract Houses: $30 Million & Over for the home. “From the initiation of excavation to the completion of this remarkable project, the builder exhibited remarkable foresight and planning,” a note on the winning entry read.\nIf Farquhar wants somewhere a bit more modern to spend some time, he can always hang at Cannon-Brookes’ $24m Northern Beaches pad, which is also on our list of Top Homes and the kind of place a Scottish Lord would probably hate.\n //www.realestate.com.au/news/why-australias-priciest-home-isnt-one-of-our-best/",

(Kentucky Today/Keith Taylor)\nJohnson chose the Wildcats over Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and Louisville. Johnson was joined by his family and friends at Woodford County’s gymnasium. His father, Dennis Johnson, played football at Kentucky under Hal Mumme and his grandfather is the late Alvis Johnson, a legendary football coach at Harrodsburg High School and later served as an athletics administrator at Kentucky.\nJohnson is considered the No. 12 overall recruit in the nation and has been playing for Overtime Elite, based in Atlanta. Johnson will join Great Crossing standout Malachi Moreno, who committed to the Wildcats last month. Moreno is considered the top center in the Class of 2025.\nJasper's Johnson's parents, Dennis and Alethea Johnson, were excited that their son chose Kentucky. (Kentucky Today/Keith Taylor)\n“It's been a really good experience,” Johnson said. “It's been a long journey. I spent a lot of hours, you know, as a young kid, dreaming and hoping I get this opportunity Being able to be here in this moment right now is a blessing.”\nJohnson said he has always wanted to play for Kentucky “from a young age” and added staying close to home is the best decision\n\"I feel like it was the best decision for me to grow and develop as a student-athlete,” he said. “My parents went there. Being able to have this opportunity being from the city and being able to represent my city and state. I feel like this was the best decision for me.\"\nJay Bordas, an assistant coach at Bryan Station, began coaching Johnson in second grade through AAU and knew Johnson was an elite talent from the beginning.\n“I told everybody in third grade he would play a professional sport, and they thought I was crazy,” Bordas said. “He’s bred to be a professional — his dad (Dennis) and the Johnsons. I’m just really happy for him. I think he's going to have a great college and, professional career. He's a great kid from a great family.”\nBordas added that Johnson “does everything extremely well on the court” and his work ethic is unmatched.\nJasper Johnson hugs his father, Dennis, after choosing Kentucky.\n“He can shoot it, shoots extremely well, plays a high level and he's athletic, more athletic than people know,” Bordas said. “He's got a great work ethic, I mean, back, even back when he was a little, little guy, he'd get 20 points for me in AAU and Dennis was never satisfied.\n“They'd be back in the gym that night — early mornings, late nights, he stays in the gym. He’s just a great guy and his work ethic is unbelievable.”\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Keith Taylor Sports Editor\nAuthor email Follow Keith Taylor Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

    "text": "Australian tourists are ignoring stern government warnings as countries including Iraq,\n[Colombia](/story/8682356/) and Somalia become \"rising star\" travel destinations.\nAdventurer and travel consultant David Smyth said his clients, particularly those aged 50 to 70 years, were booking holidays\ndespite 'do not travel' advice based on threats of kidnapping and violence.\n\"History and culture are drawing these intrepid travelers who want authentic experiences,\" he said.\nMr Smyth followed their lead when he travelled to Iraq, visiting the ancient Sumerian city Ur, in 2023. \"Mesopotamia is the cradle of civilization, the history was mind blowing,\" he said.\nTravel to Iraq increased by 50 per cent over five years, despite a dip during COVID-19 lockdowns, with 15,850 Australian travellers heading to the country in 2023 compared to 9140 travellers in 2018.\nAlmost 2000 Australians aged between 50 and 70 years went to Iraq in 2018. That figure climbed to 3600 in 2023.\n\"I'm finding 70-year-olds are the new 40-year-olds,\" the Irish-born travel agent said.\n\"They're so young at heart and they're so adventurous. They're happy to go down to a budget lodge if it gets them closer to a particular temple.\"\nHowever the Australian Government warns that the \"security situation remains volatile\" in Iraq.\n\"Due to the security environment and the threat of kidnappings, you should leave Iraq immediately by commercial means, if it's safe to do so,\" the smartraveller warning said.\nMr Smyth urged caution saying \"it's not for your first-time traveler\".\n\"The main thing is common sense. Do your research and book through a reputable company.\"\n\"Book through someone local because If you book [a trip] yourself and then something goes to pot, you're on your own.\"\nHe recommended that intrepid travellers register with their consulate.\n\"We've also noticed a significant rise in the number of women doing solo cycling or driving trips to places like the west coast of Africa,\" the travel agent said.\n\"While a beach or cruise holiday would be an easier holiday option, these adventurers are driven to travel beyond their comfort zone by the desire to see history unfold, support local communities and challenge mainstream perceptions of these regions,\"\n ",

The number of jobless workers stood at 8.2 million.\nBrazil’s economy proved resilient to double-digit borrowing costs during much of the year, with unemployment falling to levels not seen since 2015. Analysts and policymakers point to reforms such as a labor overhaul in 2017 to explain the country’s ability to grow without stoking inflation. Central bankers led by Roberto Campos Neto are cutting now rates as prices edge toward target.\nAfter kicking off one of the first easing cycles in the region in August, policymakers have since reduced rates by two percentage points, to 11.75%. They’ve also signaled two more half-percentage point drops through March.\nRead more: Brazil Annual Inflation Tops All Estimates in Early December\n--With assistance from Giovanna Serafim.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Made 2023 All About Himself\nWhat Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging Products\nWhat the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying Young\nSurviving the Markets, the Kitchen and War on The Businessweek Show\nHow the Elf on the Shelf Took Over Christmas\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.\nView comments",

    "text": "李志强 | 大马教育很失败\n1972年，教育部突然宣布在当年的中5考试（MCE）国文科没有考获优等（即6仔以上）的考生不会被赋予A等文凭。\n我们反对，但反对无效。\nADVERTISEMENT\n我们反对是因为在任何公共考试中，不能因一科成绩欠佳而被判降级，继而被淘汰进入大专学习。这与近日中5 的SPM成绩公布后教育部才宣布的（A-）成绩不被接受为（A） 的成绩一模一样，这对考生是非常不公的。\n据说，全国有投诉的260 名考生已经被拒于大学门外，就是因为（A-）不是（A）的离谱决定。\n教育部一再推出类似的 ” 苛政 ” 不易叫人信服。\n30年来，教育部属下的考试局一再将SPM的数理水平拉低以配合数理科较差的考生，使到及格标准偏低，故在数理科稍努力的学生可轻易的考获A。\n我曾经与来自中国的留学生探讨并比较两国的数理水平，彼等的结论是：大马的中5数理课程只有中国初二生 的水准。这一败笔今日还被沿用下去，OMG！\n难怪乎，人家已经在短短50年内从零到有，到高铁、到航母、到航天、到机器人、到无人机了，我们这里还是纠结在人数、肤色、特权、宗教、不公的70年漩涡里。\n想当年慕尤丁上任成为教育部长时，马上推出一套大剌剌“大马教育25年大蓝图 ”， 声称邀请了许多外国教育专家、花了若干亿投资才获呈现在大家眼前。\n今天，时过境迁，大蓝图期限未到却早被人遗忘，人民的血汗钱也已付诸公海或流入口袋？日前巧遇多名退休校长，他们说，看见教育局的长廊堆满了当年大蓝图的各类策划、报告、图片等， 倒是令人心疼与失望，我们又一次虚度20余年的光景，怎能进步？\n中国高考刚过。根据报导，高考季节时，学生拼命、熬夜，家中陪伴、心疼，就是希望在一个统一考试、公平竞争的前提下比个高低，看看谁才是名副其实的状元郎，才能进入北大与清华。\n我们的大学预科班已经有数十年“ 特权包装扶弱 ” 的运作，即安排一条平坦大道让有关学生在没有竞争（也没有水准）的情况下阔步迈向公立大学。\n那些进不到预科班（不是因为成绩不理想）、或经济条件较不许可的学生只能再浪费2年的时间考取中6（STPM），希望有机会挤入大专门槛。\n根据最新报导，靠STPM成绩成功挤入政府大学理想科系的学生人数真的是犹如凤毛麟角，少之又少。因此， 不少学生在对UPU失望之际，已经转入私立大学，准备日后出国深造 （ 又是人才外流？），这已经不是啥新闻了。\n用两种不同的考试制度与评估方式 （预科班与中6）叫孩子们拼死拼命读书进大学，我有亏欠与欺骗他们的罪恶感。\n1999年的“以55%对45%争取入大学”的内阁政治协议与较后的“保留10%给非土著学生”预科班协商成效 ，也从未有数字佐证，都是一尊尊的“破瓶装烂酒”空头承诺之作。\n教育应该回归教育，绩效更应优于协商，否则，我们的教育永远………很失败。\nADVERTISEMENT\n热门新闻\n百格视频\nADVERTISEMENT",
