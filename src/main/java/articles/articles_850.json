The city was severely damaged by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake. (STR/JIJI Press/AFP via Getty Images)\nBy Bob D'Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk January 07, 2024 at 4:53 pm EST A woman in her 90s was rescued from beneath the rubble of a collapsed house Saturday in western Japan, five days after a powerful earthquake struck the region and killed more than 126 people.\n>> Read more trending news\nThe woman, who has not been identified, had been trapped beneath the first floor of the two-story structure in the town of Suzu after the 7.56 magnitude earthquake rocked the area, The New York Times reported. She was rescued at about 8:20 p.m. local time and was taken to an area hospital, according to the officer of Ishikawa Prefecture.\nThe Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the woman was responsive but was believed to be suffering from hypothermia, the BBC reported.\nOn Sunday, a doctor told reporters that the woman was well enough to speak, but her legs were injured, according to CNN .\nKume Takanori, a member of the emergency rescue team, told NHK that the woman’s knees had been stuck under furniture between the first and second floor, CNN reported. It took hours to free her, Takanori said.\nThe Times , citing experts, reported that the window for finding survivors after an earthquake is typically three days. It is possible to survive for longer periods, depending on access to water and food, temperatures in the area and the extent of the person’s injuries.\nThe death toll from the earthquake continues to rise, with at least 222 people still reported as missing, according to the newspaper.\nWajima city has had the highest number of fatalities, with 69, The Guardian reported. Suzu has 38 deaths.\nLatest headlines: Hawaii wildfires: Police find additional remains, raises death toll to 99 ‘Life-threatening rainfall event’: Heavy rain leaving roads, subways flooded; some left stranded Hawaii wildfires: First group of residents return to Lahaina Middleboro woman trades in career as state investigator to creating wooden flower arrangements Hawaii wildfires: Officials say death toll has dropped to 97 due to DNA tests © 2024 Cox Media Group",

    "text": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Indonesia needs to make even greater efforts to boost its Islamic economy, pushing it to emerge at the top spot globally, Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto affirmed.Speaking at an Islamic boarding school (pesantren) in Bogor, West Java, on Saturday (June 1), he cited the State of the Global Islamic Economy (SGIE) 2023 report showing that Indonesia's Islamic economy came in third position, trailing second-ranked Saudi Arabia and first-ranked Malaysia.\\\"This does not make sense, considering our population of 280 million. Meanwhile, the populations of Malaysia and Saudi may be equal or less compared to that of West Java. Hence, we need to boost our Islamic economy to make it the world's number 1,\\\" he remarked.Hartarto noted that the ecosystem of Islamic economy and finance in Indonesia has been showing developments, especially in the fields of Islamic investment, halal food and beverages, modest fashion, pharmacy, cosmetics, and Muslim-friendly tourism.Standing among countries with the largest Muslim populations, Indonesia still wields huge potential to further develop its Islamic economy and finance. The potential is reflected in the existence of around 4.8 million pesantren students and 39.6 thousand pesantrens across the country, he said.He underlined that as many as 12,469 pesantrens, or nearly 40 percent of the total existing pesantrens, have the potential to contribute to the economy through agriculture, farming, fishery, as well as micro, small, and medium enterprises.\\\"As a religious educational institution, a pesantren also shares the responsibility to empower people socially and economically,\\\" he opined.Hartarto then emphasized the importance of endorsing inclusive finance, which serves as a critical component in actualizing a more inclusive society.In this regard, he noted that the government had issued Presidential Regulation No. 114 of 2020 that aimed to accelerate the broadening of people's access to financial products through intensified coordination between the central and regional governments, financial services industry, community organizations, and educational institutions.\\\"I hope that we will manage to achieve the target of boosting our financial inclusion rate to 90 percent by cooperating with pesantrens,\\\" he added.ANTARAEditor's Choice: President-elect Prabowo Subianto Pledges to Strengthen Indonesia's Defense Ties with SingaporeClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",

    "title": "Cannabis Use Linked to Increased Cancer Risk",
    "text": "Cannabis use may raise cancer risk, with studies linking it to certain cancers.\nCannabis consumption can wreak havoc on our cellular health, significantly increasing the risk of developing deadly cancerous tumors. In the study, published in the scientific journal Addiction Biology, cannabis is described as a “genotoxic” substance because it damages a cell's genetic information. This can lead to DNA mutations, accelerated ageing, and cancer. Alarmingly, this genotoxicity can be passed on to the next generation via a damaged egg and sperm -- making the risk of cannabis use trans-generational, said the researchers from the University of Western Australia.\n‘#Cannabis can damage your #DNA? It’s classified as a #genotoxic substance, linked to DNA mutations, premature aging, and even #cancer. #weed’\nIn the study, the team also linked established knowledge that cannabis use damages cellular energy production by inhibiting mitochondria with recent cancer research showing that mitochondrial dysfunction drives chromosomal damage which can surge rates of cancer, accelerated ageing, and birth defects.\nCannabis: A Hereditary Health Risk\n“The link we’ve described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences. This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations,” said Dr. Stuart Reece from the varsity Cannabis has been known to be linked with both micronuclear development and mitochondrial inhibition for many decades. Both human and rodent studies show that adult cannabis exposure is linked with the incidence of autism and cerebral processing difficulties in children prenatally exposed. However, the study argued that cannabinoid genotoxicity has long been “overlooked”.The researchers noted that “it may, in fact, be all around us through the rapid induction of ageing of eggs, sperm, zygotes, foetus and adult organisms with many lines of evidence demonstrating transgenerational impacts”.\nTogether, the data is clear and robust evidence for the transgenerational transmission of major genotoxic outcomes. In light of this, Reece called on policymakers to “reframe the discussion surrounding cannabis legalisation from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.”\nSource-IANS",
