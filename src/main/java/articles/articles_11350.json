    "text": "The Miami Heat have seen many legends come and go from their organization over the years and one current star is dreaming of following in their footsteps.\nThe Heat are a side in the middle of some drama at the moment with the future of Jimmy Butler shrowding much of the good work the side is producing.\nIn Butler’s absence Tyler Herro has highlighted how Bam Adebayo has stepped up as a leader in the side, he is now the most experienced player on the roster.\nAdebayo has been with the Heat since being picked up as the 14th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft and he has been a strong pair of shoulders to rely on over the years.\nPhoto by Soobum Im/Getty Images Adebayo would love to have Heat Jersey retired Despite being just 27 Adebayo plays with the poise and nouse of an NBA veteran and is hoping to wear just one jersey for his entire NBA career.\nAdebayo wears the number 13 jersey with pride and is dreaming of having it retired one day by the heat.\nHis on-court skills which see him average 15.9 points, 9.6 rebounds and 4.6 assists this season combined with his brilliant personable skills have seen him become a huge favorite in Miami among both fans and teammates.\nThe three-time NBA All-Star is not afraid to share his knowledge with up-and-coming Heat talent , something that not all stars like to do.\nBam who made the 2024 All-Defensive First Team explained how he wants to finish his career as a Heat legend when he spoke with Andscape : “What creeps in my mind is when I start seeing my name just pass somebody for third, just pass somebody for fourth, you start creeping up and my goal was I want to be top three, top two, even one in all categories in Heat history.\n“So, for me to do that, I got to be here long enough. I’ve been here eight years and looking forward to continuing being here.”\nAsked whether he deserves a statue like Heat legend Dwyane Wade he said: “Do I deserve a statue? You dream of that. Obviously, that comes with championships, all other good stuff. But I do dream of seeing my jersey in the rafters.”\nPhoto by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images Stars to have Heat jerseys retired If Adebayo does have his jersey retired he will be joining some pretty legendary company at the Heat.\nWhile it will likely take a potential championship win or similar to guarantee this his loyalty to the franchise should not be overlooked.\nIn a time where players move around constantly through the trade market loyalty is hard to find.\nHeat retired jerseys\n1 – Chris Bosh 3 – Dwyane Wade 10 – Tim Hardaway 32 – Shaquille O’Neal 33 – Alonzo Mourning 40 – Udonis Haslem In an interesting coincidence, the Heat have already displayed the 13 jersey worn by Adebayo. However, this was done to acknowledge the former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.",

    "text": "Now that is one smart alligator. There are a lot of smart creatures out there in the animal kingdom, and in case you didn’t know, one of them is the alligator. Despite having a brain the size of a walnut, they have more than a few tricks up their sleeve. With as long as they’ve roamed the Earth, you would hope they would catch onto a couple of things after a while, right? One of the ways we know that alligators, and crocodiles, are smart is because they’ve showcased the art of tool use. Both gators and crocodiles have been known to utilize twigs to lure in birds, and the video below is quite possibly the best example that’s ever been captured on camera. Now, I say that alligators smart, but that doesn’t always mean that they try all that hard all of the time. The scaly reptiles can also be opportunistic, like the one in this terrifying video of a [gator emerging from the darkness to drag a road-kill-fish](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2024/03/13/9-foot-alligator-emerges-from-darkness-drags-big-ol-fish-off-the-road/) (confusing, I know) back into its pond. There’s nothing wrong with it doing it that way, though I’d argue it’s a tad more interesting to watch a more clever alligator in action. The one in this video below was lurking around the Florida Everglades trying to figure out how it could turn a bird into a snack, and eventually came up with an idea. Gators within the water we’re keeping their eyes on some egrets, a long-legged white bird that can commonly be found in groups in South Florida. They tend to hang out near the water, and even hunt small fish, but do their best to stay out of harm’s way (A.K.A. an alligator’s mouth). However, one task that can put the egrets in danger is nest building. The bright white birds tend to search the surface of the water for small, malleable twigs, diving down to pick them up and returning to their nests to add to their pile of building supplies. Alligators take note of this practice, which is why those near the gator-infested waters will sometimes see the reptiles swimming just underneath the water while balancing a stick perfectly on their snout. See where I’m going with this? You might, but the egrets usually don’t. The twig-on-the-nose trick is rather successful in luring birds in, and once they get close enough, the alligators send the stick flying up into the air to make room in their jaw for the bird they are about to chomp down on. It’s a process that can have mixed results, though the gator in the video had the practice down pat. Take a look:",

    "text": "El meteorólogo José Miguel Viñas alerta de que las danas del futuro «serán intensas y extremas como la de Valencia»\nEl experto avisa de que la predicción perfecta «no existe porque, una vez que diluvia, el agua fluye veloz y no hay tiempo para prepararse»\nEl físico, meteorólogo y divulgador José Miguel Viñas, formado en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, ha alertado de que fenómenos meteorológicos como el producido recientemente en Valencia serán la «nueva normalidad» debido, entre otros motivos, a la subida generalizada de las temperaturas. Así lo expuso ayer en la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales en una conferencia titulada 'De las gotas frías de ayer a las danas de hoy y mañana'.\nEn este sentido, el meteorólogo incidió en que el agua del mediterráneo este otoño «ha estado entre uno y dos grados, más caliente de lo que es habitual en estas fechas, por lo que el vapor, el agua que se evapora, está también más caliente». Este aumento del calor, añadió al respecto, produce un aumento de la energía que circula en la atmósfera por lo que, según Viñas, «tenemos danas dopadas», danas con un exceso de energía que funciona como gasolina para estas precipitaciones.\nSe intuía desde cinco días antes\nSegún el meteorólogo citado, la intensidad de la lluvia en Valencia del día 29 de octubre, se intuía ya desde los mapas de previsiones del día 24, es decir, cuatro días antes de que la dana desbordara los ríos. «El mapa del 24 era tan sorprendente que me fui a consultar el mapa de la riada de Tous del 82 para ver los paralelismos».\nEl problema de las predicciones es que a veces, en el último minuto, las danas giran y se desvían, como sucedió en Madrid en septiembre de 2023, cuando se alertó a la población mediante mensajes a los móviles de una fuerte dana, que descargó sin embargo en Castilla-La Mancha perdiendo además potencia en el cambio de rumbo.\n«La predicción perfecta no existe»\nAdemás, explica Viñas: «La predicción perfecta no existe porque, una vez que diluvia, el agua fluye veloz. No hay tiempo para prepararse». El meteorólogo hizo hincapié en la necesidad disponer de buen sistema de alertas: «Aunque la predicción meteorológica no sea exacta, es imprescindible un buen sistema para salvar vidas.»\nEl término «dana», que es el acrónimo de «depresión aislada niveles altos», comenzó a usarse en los años 80 para alejarse del concepto de «gota fría» y que el imaginario colectivo tenía muy asociado tragedias como la rotura de la presa de Tous en Valencia en 1982 cuando 300.000 personas se quedaron sin casa.",
