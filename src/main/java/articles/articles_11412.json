Nist said she was grateful for the \"love and support\" the pair received during their time on “The Golden Bachelor,” a “Bachelor” spinoff where seniors attempt to find love. \"I don’t think we can tell you how many people told us that it gave them so much hope,\" she said, adding, “We want none of that to change for anybody.” The couple said that despite their split, they still love each other. “I still love this person,” said Turner. “There’s no doubt in my mind, I still am in love with her. I root for her every day.” \"Yeah, I still love him,” Nist agreed. On April 15, Nist [opened up about her split with Turner on Instagram.](https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/theresa-nist-golden-bachelor-divorce-gerry-turner-rcna147915) In a lengthy caption, Nist thanked fans for their support, calling her time on the reality dating series “one of the most incredible experiences of my life, something I never expected to happen at this point in my life and I truly thought it was going to last forever. \" She added, \"It turns out, even at the age of 70, you don’t know everything.” Nist concluded her post by urging fans stay open to all the “experiences, opportunities, and love that may come your way. Keep smiling, keep laughing… I will. I love you all.”",

    "title": "Claremore Community Rallies Together For Tornado Relief, BancFirst Makes $25K Donation",
    "text": "Friday, June 21st 2024, 3:57 pm A tornado relief fund in Claremore is getting a boost after a $25,000 donation from BancFirst. Leaders with the Claremore Rogers County Disaster Assistance Program say they need to raise half a million dollars to help those in need, and today's check from Banc First will help them get there. It's a good day for Sean Tibbs, he's stopping by Destiny Life Church to pick up a check for his family. \"It's definitely going to be a boost it's definitely going to help us out,\" says Tibbs. Sean says he was lucky and only has to deal with a broken fence and some trees uprooted by the tornado, but a little extra cash to make repairs and feed his family goes a long way. \"Oh it's huge, it's huge, it's Definitely like a shot of hope kind of thing ya know like you can see a light at the end of the tunnel kind of thing,\" Tibbs says. That much-needed financial help is coming from the Claremore Rogers County Disaster Assistance program. Organizers say to help the 400 people on their waiting list, they need around 500,000 dollars. \"That is a lot of money for just 400 households, just imagine and we get applications every day, \" says Kacey Alchammat. She says the money the program gives out helps with things like home repairs and getting electricity back. \"Just in today's day and age you don't have thousands of dollars lying around to restore your electricity after a natural disaster you didn't even know was possible,\" says Alchammat. A $25,000 check from Banc First will help them reach more people. Market President Steven Burrus hopes it inspires others to give too. “It's really to bring an awareness to this fund so that we can go out and seek other funding, there is a tremendous need out there,\" says Burrus. \"If you need assistance, you can still apply at Serve.love/Claremore.

    "title": "La DANA va a complicar el puente y dejará más de 100 l\\/m2 en Catalunya y Comunitat Valenciana",
    "text": "La presencia de la [DANA](/tags/dana/) va a seguir complicando el tiempo durante el puente de Todos los Santos y podría dejar este viernes más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2) en el sur de Cataluña y el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana, según la predicción del portavoz de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), Rubén del Campo. Por ello, ha pedido consultar el estado del tiempo y de las carreteras si se va a emprender un viaje. Del Campo ha explicado que la situación más complicada de este viernes estará en el suroeste peninsular. En concreto, Huelva registrará chubascos muy fuertes y podrá superar los 40 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2). A su vez, también caerán probablemente chubascos fuertes en otras zonas de Andalucía occidental y sur de Extremadura. Además, ha añadido que la situación seguirá siendo complicada en el área mediterránea, en el sur de Catalunya especialmente y en el norte de la Comunitat Valenciana. Allí, los chubascos podrán ser persistentes y los acumulados podrán superar los 100 l/m2. Esto puede provocar de nuevo crecidas en cauces e inundaciones en zonas bajas, por lo que el portavoz de [AEMET](/tags/aemet/) ha recomendado alejarse de este tipo de zonas. Lluvias intensas en Baleares A su vez, ha advertido sobre el clima en Baleares durante la jornada del viernes. En las islas, las lluvias podrán ser muy intensas y podrán dejar 50 l/m2 en sólo una hora o incluso 120 l/m2 en unas pocos horas. Al igual que en el caso de la Comunitat Valenciana, Del Campo ha pedido precaución en el archipiélago, dado que también pueden producirse crecidas e inundaciones en zonas bajas. El sábado continuará la inestabilidad con chubascos de nuevo fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Catalunya, en la Comunitat Valenciana y de nuevo en el archipiélago Balear. De forma más débil, se podrán registrar en puntos del tercio sur de la península. Situación estable desde el domingo El portavoz de AEMET ha avanzado que la tendencia para el domingo y el lunes es la de que la DANA vaya desapareciendo y que la situación sea más estable. Aún así, ha indicado que todavía se producirán chubascos en el Levante, en Catalunya, en el área del Estrecho y en Baleares. Estos podrán ser fuertes aún durante el lunes, en especial en el sur de Catalunya, en la Comunitat Valenciana y en el sur de Aragón. De cara al martes y días siguientes probablemente se dará una situación más estable en todo el país, aunque a día de hoy, Del Campo no descarta posibles chubascos, una vez más, en el [área Mediterránea](/tags/mediterraneo/). Todo esto estará acompañado con unas temperaturas que no van a variar demasiado y que serán en general algo más cálidas de lo habitual para esta época del año.",

    "title": "2025 Community Prospect Rankings: Chase Petty is the Reds #4 prospect!",
    "text": "Chase Petty had quite the interesting 2024. He set a career high in innings pitched (137.0) while finally getting his full velocity back after a forearm issue tempered things in 2023, and even reached AAA for a pair of starts to finish the season.\nDespite the uptick in velocity, he also got hit harder in 2024 than he had previously. His ERA jumped from 1.72 to 4.39 year over year, and that came with a significant drop in his groundball rate (42.3%, down from 56.4% in 2023).\nDid he alter his pitch mix? Did he try to attack hitters in a fundamentally different way?\nThe good news is that he seems fully healthy, and 2024 might just have been an example of him working through some things after finally having everything available to him each day. That sets the stage for a 2025 season in which the former 1st round pick of the Minnesota Twins can really, truly emerge as the kind of pitcher the Reds hoped he’d be when they traded away Sonny Gray for him.\nHe’s the #4 prospect in this year’s Community Prospect Rankings, and the #2 prospect in this year’s rankings of Pitchers in the Reds Organization Named Chase.\nOn to the voting for the next spot!\n******************************************************************************\nCam Collier, 3B - 20 years old\n2024 at a glance: .248/.355/.433 (129 wRC+) with 20 HR, 2 SB in 507 PA for the Dayton Dragons(A+ Midwest League)\nPros: High contact left-handed bat with excellent strike zone command; power finally emerged at Dayton after escaping the pitcher-friendly Florida State League\nCons: Not the most athletic defender or base runner, who may have to move off 3B; ran both very hot and very cold for long stretches of 2024 season\nOnly Chris Newell (Los Angeles Dodgers org, 23) socked more Midwest League homers than Collier’s 20 last year, and Collier did all of that damage as a 19 year old. He sported a 13.0% walk-rate and his 66 total walks ranked as the 5th most across the league.\nHe’s got a strong arm, per scouting reports, but he’s not the most agile defender at 3B. There remain questions as to whether he’d be a better fit at 1B (or DH altogether), but at least the bat is beginning to make enough noise to make that less of a long-term concern. Keep in mind that just three hitters who logged at least 300 PA in the Midwest League last year were younger than Cam, who’ll ply his trade for AA Chattanooga to begin 2025.\nSal Stewart, 3B/2B - 21 years old\n2024 at a glance: .279/.391/.454 with 8 HR, 10 SB in 338 PA split with the Dayton Dragons (High-A Midwest League)\nPros: As many walks (138) as strikeouts (139) so far as a professional, advanced strike zone command; raw power\nCons: In-game power still developing; still a defensive nomad despite reasonable showing at 2B; wrist injury ended season early (and required surgery)\nThe Reds selected Sal Stewart out of high school in Florida with the 32nd overall pick in the 2022 MLB Draft, doing so despite knowing he was committed to baseball powerhouse Vanderbilt University. Perhaps they knew something, or had some inside info from former Vandy pitching coach Derek Johnson, since they managed to get Stewart signed for just the 40th highest bonus of the draft class despite that strong commitment.\nHe’s done nothing but be an offensive machine in his pro career, sporting one of the best K/BB ratios of any minor leaguer while pairing it with emerging power that’s playing up as he advanced out of the hitter hell that is the Florida State League. His 144 wRC+ with Dayton ranked as the 5th best among the 87 hitters who logged at least 300 PA there.\nUnfortunately, an off the field wrist injury in July ended his season and required surgery, though as of October he was reportedly swinging a bat again and is on-track to face AA pitching for the first time in 2025.\nAlfredo Duno, C/DH - 19 years old\n2024 at a glance: .267/.367/.422 with 3 HR, 2 SB in 139 PA with Daytona Tortugas (Class A Florida State League)\nPros: Plus arm and agility at the catching position paired with plus raw power and elite bat speed\nCons: We’ve still barely seen him play, let alone catch (just 21 G as a C in his pair of pro seasons within the Reds organization)\nA rib issue cut short Duno’s first full season of pro ball in 2024, though he flashed precisely what the scouting report suggested in his limited time with the Tortugas: an advanced offensive approach, some big projectible pop, and athleticism behind the dish.\nI’d like to think that over 100 or so games with Dayton in 2025, the world would see enough of that to be convinced he’s the heir apparent to the Cincinnati catching position, and a clear-cut Top 100 overall prospect. Of course, he’s so far 0 for 2 in staying healthy enough to show that to the world, so we’ll have to hope he bats .333 in that category by season’s end.\nSammy Stafura, SS - 20 years old\n2024 at a glance: .270/.387/.412 with 8 HR, 31 SB in 421 PA split between ACL Reds (Arizona Complex League) and Daytona Tortugas (Class A Florida State League); named Reds Minor League Hitter of the Year\nPros: 65 grade speed and plus baserunning acumen; 15.2% walk rate evidence of great patience and eye at the plate; plus defender who profiles as capable of sticking at short\nCons: In-game power hasn’t showed up just yet, though he spent the bulk of his year in the pitcher-friendly Florida State League (where he had a .124 ISO and .379 SLG)\nYou don’t have to squint too hard to see in Stafura a guy who hits leadoff for the Cincinnati Reds for a long time. He gets on base, he swipes bases, and so far looks very much the part of an up-the-middle piece that was well worth the ~$2.5 million signing bonus he got to skip Clemson University and sign with the Reds as a 2nd round pick in 2023.\nThere’s truly a chance we’ve not even scratched the surface with him yet, either. Drafted out of New York, he’s one of those classic ‘high schoolers from cold weather’ whose stats before being drafted don’t typically show what he’s truly capable of doing, and his lone ‘full’ season in 2024 featured the suppressive offensive environment that is the FSL. If he gets to Dayton and the power emerges, we’re looking at a guy with a Sal Stewart-esque approach at the plate who can also be a plus shortstop.\nAnd he just turned 20!\nTyson Lewis, SS - 19 years old\n2024 at a glance: Hit .496 with 8 dingers and 14 doubles in 38 games for Millard West High School in Omaha, NE; drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 2nd round of the 2024 MLB Draft; signed for an above-slot $3.05 million to turn pro in lieu of attending the University of Arkansas\nPros: Well rounded athlete with 60-grade speed and potential for good power from the left side of the plate\nCons: Defense is solid, yet not spectacular at SS, and it’s likely he ends up moved off the position; not exactly from a baseball hotbed\nTyson Lewis has above-average ability across the board, and if you squint you can see a potential five-tool guy. Right now, it’s more that he’s something of a B+ student in all five tools instead of a guy who’s got two A’s and a trio of Cs.\nThat can be a good thing! It’s just that we need to see how it translates level by level, since it doesn’t appear he’s shown anything yet that has people already convinced one particular skill is way beyond his level.\nHe’s just 19, of course, and there’s ample opportunity for that to be shown, he’s just not yet played a professional game since being drafted. So, Lewis gets to play the role of mystery team in this year’s CPR - let’s see who among us is already convinced!\nPoll\nWho is the #5 prospect in the Reds system?\n-\n8%\nSammy Stafura\n-\n2%\nAlfredo Duno\n-\n32%\nSal Stewart\n-\n53%\nCam Collier\n-\n1%\nTyson Lewis\nVote Now",

    "text": "Indian Army Awards Contract to Johnnette Technologies for Supply of Made-in-India Johnnette JF-2 Tactical, India’s First Crash Resistant Drone Johnnette Technologies, a leading Indian Unmanned Systems manufacturer headquartered in Noida, has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its flagship tactical fixed-wing UAV, the Johnnette JF-2, for border surveillance. The company proudly asserts that the JF-2 is India’s first crash-resistant drone, representing a significant milestone in the nation’s pursuit of self-reliance in defense manufacturing. Founded in 2014 by Lt Cdr John Livingstone, a retired Indian Navy officer, Johnnette Technologies has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge unmanned systems technology for both military and commercial applications in India. The company’s commitment aligns with the ‘Make in India’ initiative spearheaded by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Lt Cdr John Livingstone, Founder, and CEO of Johnnette Technologies, expressed his pride in contributing to national security: “It is a great feeling to be able to serve the nation even after retiring from the Defence Forces. My team has done prolonged R&D and have created this tactical fixed-wing UAV, Johnnette JF-2, for the Military requirements. The uniqueness of our lightweight JF-2 is its ability to be crash-resistant in multiple terrains due to its sturdy belly-landing design.” The Johnnette JF-2 is a hand-launched fixed-wing tactical UAV designed specifically for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. Equipped with a high-definition day camera and a thermal imaging camera, the platform is tailored for day and night operations. Noteworthy features include a crash-proof avionics bay, anti-jamming, and anti-spoofing capabilities, making it an ideal solution for land forces. This marks the first deployment of a fixed-wing UAV in its class by the Indian Army for border surveillance. Johnnette Technologies Pvt Ltd., established in November 2014, has been a trailblazer in Unmanned Systems Technology in India. The company has consistently delivered cutting-edge aerospace systems to the paramilitary, commercial, aerospace, and defense sectors, with a primary focus on unmanned systems technology. In addition to the Johnnette JF-2, the company also manufactures low-cost loitering munitions (Kamikaze drones) and has ambitious plans to produce Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) in the future. As India continues to strengthen its indigenous defense capabilities, Johnnette Technologies’ innovative contributions underscore the growing role of domestic firms in meeting the evolving requirements of the armed forces.
