    "title": "A Year in Stocks: What Worked and What Didn’t in 2023",
    "text": "With just a couple of days left in the trading year, all the major markets are posting significant gains. At this time in 2022, not many investors would have taken that side of the bet. So, what lessons should investors take away after a volatile and unpredictable year in stocks? For starters, 2023 was a good reminder to invest in the market that is, not what you think it should be. To put that in terms that any parent with a teenager will understand: Trust but verify. At more than one point this past year, you would have believed a stock market crash not seen since 1929 was around the corner. Yet, every time, equities got off the mat, dusted themselves off and moved higher. And as the year comes to an end, there are billions, if not trillions of dollars re-entering the market. But are those dollars chasing overpriced stocks, or are they going after small-cap stocks with a lot of potential but no proven track record? And where should investors be thinking about putting their money in 2024? Here are some thoughts on the lessons a year in stocks can teach us. There’s a Reason Why Nvidia Is Just Getting Started Many investors aren’t sure what to make of the artificial intelligence ( [AI](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ai-stock-quote/)) boom. On the one hand, to paraphrase writer Alan Saunders, AI is an example of life happening while we are busy making other plans. That is, we’ve known about AI for some time, yet the ChatGPT phenomenon made it impossible to ignore. The question is: Will it be friend or foe? Like all technological advances, it will likely be a little of both. As much as well-intentioned regulators will try, there will be bad actors with equally bad intentions. That’s troublesome. But on balance, AI will be transformative in how we interact with technology. And by we, I mean many who find today’s technology limiting. That means, like the internet, it’s a net win. That’s why companies are rushing to get in on AI. It’s not going to be a nice-to-have, it will be a must-have. And it’s also why companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/)), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: [AMD](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amd-stock-quote/)) and other [chip companies will flourish.](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/the-winners-and-losers-2023-stock-market-performance-review/) This is the beginning of a super cycle, and there’s still a lot of runway ahead. The Death of the Consumer Was (Mildly) Exaggerated Part of analyzing a year in stocks is identifying the best and worst sectors. At the beginning of the year, conventional wisdom was that consumer staples would do well and [consumer discretionary stocks](https://investorplace.com/industries/consumer-discretionary/) would struggle. In fact, the opposite occurred. Consumer staples have been the second-worst-performing sector. The companies performed well enough, but investors starving for growth [shifted to high-flying tech stocks.](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/outlook-consumer-staples) Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks are up nearly 20% as demand for travel and recreation remains strong. Is this demand being fueled by reckless spending that will come crashing down when the credit card bills come due? That’s been predicted for some time, and it hasn’t happened yet. The takeaway for investors is two-fold. One, don’t bet against the consumer. And two, be selective. Just because the consumer staples sector underperformed doesn’t mean there were no winners. Conversely, many consumer discretionary stocks really did face some tough times. Demand Delayed Is Not Demand Denied The energy sector did not perform as expected. For starters, the renewable energy movement is still struggling to get off the starting blocks. The solar sector is a good example of why even government subsidies can’t change the basics of supply and demand. The same could be said of electric vehicles. Yet, oil and gas stocks have been laggards as well. In September and October, crude oil prices near $100 were considered a certainty. But as the year comes to an end, crude oil is closer to $70. In both cases, investors should look at this as a case of demand delayed, not denied. In December, the Federal Reserve all but ensured interest rates would be cut in 2024, more than once — most likely. When that happens, oil demand will rise and, with it, the price of crude oil. An improving economy will also be a boost for renewable energy companies, which will benefit from [lower capital costs.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/climate/renewable-energy-inflation-climate-cop28.html) On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "text": "Recientemente se hizo tendencia crear imágenes estilo\nGhibli con ayuda de ChatGPT, la inteligencia artificial de OpenAI. Ahora, te enseñaremos cómo crear una figura estilo Funko Pop con tu cara y nombre.\nPara ello, necesitarás usar ChatGPT. Es muy importante que antes tengas una cuenta en el chatbot de IA, no importa sino pagas alguna versión, solo basta con estar registrado para lograrlo.\nUna vez que tengas tu registro, podrás continuar con los pasos que te presentamos a continuación.\nLeer también:\nNintendo Switch 2: costo y cuándo saldrá a la venta\nPaso a paso para crear una imagen estilo Funko Pop con tu cara en ChatGPT\nPara lograr colocar tu rostro en una imagen estilo Funko Pop existen dos formas. La primera consiste en crear un prompt donde brindes detalles específicos de ti mismo para que la inteligencia artificial te brinde los resultados que esperas.\nPor ejemplo, en\nTech Bit utilizamos el siguiente prompt: \"Crea una imagen estilo Funko Pop en la que aparezca una mujer mexicana llamada \"Paloma\" y el número 1998. La muñeca debe tener cabello largo y rizado con fleco. Su cabello es de color café. Viste un vestido azul y usa lentes. Debe contar con accesorios de una periodista como una libreta, un micrófono, una cámara y una grabadora\".\nEl resultado fue el siguiente:\nTambién puedes hacerlo con otras personas o celebridades, solo que tu prompt debe ser lo más descriptivo posible para que te brinde el resultado esperado.\nOtra de las versiones de prompt que hicimos fue: \"Crea una imagen estilo Funko Pop en la que aparezca el piloto británico de Fórmula 1 Lewis Hamilton y el número 44. El muñeco debe vestir el nómex de Ferrari y debe contar con accesorios como su bulldog de mascota\".\nY este fue el resultado:\nPor otro lado, la segunda forma de crear una imagen estilo Funko Pop con tu cara en ChatGPT es mediante una imagen de tu rostro.\nEn este caso, utilizamos una imagen de un idol coreano al que le agregamos el siguiente prompt: \"Dibuja una figura de Funko Pop en la que aparezca un hombre llamado \"YOONGI\" y el número 1992 en la caja a a partir de esta imagen\". El resultado fue:\nAl crear este tipo de imágenes, debes saber que solo debe hacerse para uso personal, educativo o artístico y no intentar vender o lucrar con las imágenes que imiten propiedades protegidas por derechos de autor.\nPor otro lado, si vas a compartirla a través de redes sociales, debes reconocer que fueron generadas por IA.\nLeer también:\n¿Qué carrera estudió Steve Jobs para crear Apple?\nRecibe todos los viernes Hello Weekend, nuestro newsletter con lo último en gastronomía, viajes, tecnología, autos, moda y belleza.

    "text": "As countries around the world turn to Canada as a supplier of choice for clean energy, critical minerals and clean technologies, Canada continues to work with innovators, Indigenous partners and youth through fora such as the GLOBE Forum to help communities seize the economic opportunities presented by ambitious climate action. This week, Parliamentary Secretary Julie Dabrusin represented the Government of Canada at GLOBE Forum 2024 in Vancouver, B.C., to advance action toward net-zero innovation and inclusive economic growth with partners. The Parliamentary Secretary attended on behalf of the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, and the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. While at GLOBE, Parliamentary Secretary Dabrusin: · Championed the government's vision for clean growth through her participation in key sessions with youth, industry innovators and women leaders in the energy sector, highlighting Canada's commitments to creating sustainable, high-quality jobs for youth and to achieving gender equality and broader inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility in the energy sector - including through Equal by 30. · Hosted GLOBE's Clean Tech Pitch Panel with seven of the 13 Canadian companies named to the 2024 Global Cleantech 100 list and joined businesses involved in the Net-Zero Challenge, who discussed their motivations and experience as well as the challenges, opportunities and lessons learned in planning and pursuing net-zero commitments. · Jointly convened industry and community leaders to discuss climate-resilient infrastructure and housing and climate-proofing Canadian communities through collaborations across governments and sectors with the Honourable Sean Fraser, Canada's Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities. Parliamentary Secretary Dabrusin also jointly announced - with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) - an investment of over $900,000 through the Green Municipal Fund (GMF) to support local climate action projects in six communities across British Columbia. By supporting municipal initiatives that reduce emissions and enhance resiliency, Canada is working collaboratively to deliver for British Columbians. The Parliamentary Secretary then visited [Vancouver's Firehall No.17](https://vancouver.ca/your-government/firehall-17.aspx), one of Canada's first net-zero fire halls, where she met with local firefighters. The Government of Canada is supporting clean technology innovation, the creation of good jobs and meaningful partnerships. Canada is dedicated to the active participation of women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, immigrants, racialized peoples and persons with disabilities in building a sustainable and prosperous future on the road to net zero.
