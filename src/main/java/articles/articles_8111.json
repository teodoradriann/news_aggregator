    "text": "By William Frost ,\n1 hour ago\nReid Detmers made a strong return to the major leagues, showcasing his skills against the Los Angeles Dodgers after a three-month stint in Triple-A. The left-handed pitcher, who had struggled earlier in the season with a 6.14 ERA, limited the Dodgers to just two earned runs over six innings, striking out ten batters and allowing only three hits.\nDetmers faced a challenging top of the Dodgers' lineup in the third inning, where he surrendered both runs during a brief stretch. However, he quickly regained his composure, retiring the last 11 batters he faced and demonstrating the effectiveness of his revamped slider, which produced a 42% swing-and-miss rate.\n“I’m glad to be back,” Detmers said . “It’s been a long three months. It was all worth it. The first innings my legs were a little shaky. I wasn’t nervous. It’s just a lot of adrenaline. I’m just happy to be back be a part of this club and just help us win some games.”\nManager Ron Washington praised Detmers for his improved command and ability to mix pitches effectively, particularly highlighting his use of off-speed pitches to keep hitters off-balance.\n“Outstanding,” Washington said of Detmers . “The best command I’ve seen him have with his fastball. And you know, he was able to use his offspeed pitches in some very good situations. That got them off-balance, especially his changeup.”\nDetmers had a specific strategy in mind for facing his former teammate, Shohei Ohtani, focusing on changing speeds and keeping the ball away.\n\"Just stay away, really,\" Detmers said . \"Keep changing eye levels, keep changing speeds. I wasn’t trying to do anything crazy, just trying to let him get himself out.”\nOhtani finished the night with one hit, a triple, while also scoring two runs and striking out once. Overall, the Angels' pitching staff proved effective, with eight Dodgers striking out at least once during the game.\nRelated: Angels News: Ron Washington Justifies Intentionally Walking Shohei Ohtani\nAfter Detmers' solid outing, the Angels turned to their bullpen to finish the game, but only one reliever allowed more than one hit. Detmers' performance has likely secured him another chance to remain in the starting rotation as the season progresses.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "La DANA que ha golpeado en los últimos días todo el litoral mediterráneo español sigue activa y en las últimas horas se ha situado en el mar al norte de la isla. Aemet ha elevado la alerta amarilla a naranja porque se prevén episodios de alrededor de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. El riesgo naranja permanecerá activo hasta las 20 horas de este viernes día festivo de Tots Sants. Las lluvias han descargado con fuerza en algunos puntos de la isla desde primera hora de la mañana, ya que la tormenta ha barrido buena parte de la isla. Sobre todo en la zona norte, con chubascos potentes en la zona de Sant Vicent, Sant Joan y entre Santa Agnès y Sant Mateu. Pero también se han producido lluvias intensas en otros puntos, como el Pla de Sant Antoni, en Santa Eulària hacia el interior e incluso en puntos aislados de Sant Josep y en la ciudad de Eivissa, donde se han producido algunas inundaciones. También en las últimas horas se han producido tormentas en Formentera. Se recomienda no estar en zonas inundables ni utilizar las carreteras, ya que es un fenómeno impredecible que puede descargar tormentas y provocar inundaciones en pocos minutos. Desde las 9 de la mañana también han descargado decenas de rayos en diferentes puntos de la isla. Aunque el grueso de la DANA sigue afectando desde anoche principalmente a la zona de Castellón y el Sur de Tarragona, se ha ido desplazando hacia el Mediterráneo y un frente está situado durante toda la madrugada y la mañana entre Ibiza y Mallorca. Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza, Formentera, Mallorca y Menorca.",
