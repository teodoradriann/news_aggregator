This season, we'll be breaking down the league's best receivers each week, offering a detailed look at each player's impact. As we examine these wide receiver rankings, keep in mind that these early-season receiving grades are fluid and will continue to evolve over the coming weeks. Once we have larger sample sizes, the rankings will stabilize, giving a clearer picture of the top performers. 1. [Chris Godwin](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/chris-godwin/11839), [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/tampa-bay-buccaneers/30) (91.1) Godwin continued his hot start to the season, recording four catches of 15-plus yards against Detroit, including a 41-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Godwin was the only Bucs player with over 50 receiving yards on the day. Godwin has caught 15 of his 16 targets through the first two weeks of the season, gaining 12 first downs and catching two touchdowns. He is top-three among all receivers in catches, yards (200), first downs and yards per route run (3.92). Godwin has been perfect against zone coverage, catching all 10 of his targets for 152 yards. He has also been perfect in late-down situations, catching all seven of his targets for 99 yards and six first downs. Godwin has a perfect passer rating when targeted to start the season. 2. [Nico Collins](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/nico-collins/61441), [Houston Texans](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/houston-texans/13) (90.5) Collins had another big game Sunday night, catching eight of his 10 targets for 135 yards. Six of those catches gained over 15 yards, including two catches of 25-plus yards. Collins has been targeted 18 times over the first two weeks and leads all receivers in yards (252) and explosive gains (9). He’s caught all six of his late-down targets for 86 yards and has gained 12 first downs overall. 3. [Deebo Samuel](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/deebo-samuel/48274), [San Francisco 49ers](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/san-francisco-49ers/28) (85.5) Samuel had four gains of 15-plus yards against Minnesota, finishing with six first downs gained and 110 receiving yards. He leads San Francisco in targets (19), catches (13) and receiving yards (164) through the first two weeks of the season and is averaging 2.45 yards per route run. Almost all of his production (11 catches, 147 yards) has come against zone coverage. Samuel suffered a calf strain during the game and is expected to miss a few weeks. 4. [Rashee Rice](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/rashee-rice/97605/draft-profile), [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs/16) (83.6) Rice recorded five catches for 75 yards against Cincinnati. He had a 44-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter and finished the day with a perfect passer rating when targeted. Rice has caught 12 of his 15 targets to start the season and currently ranks seventh in receiving yards (178). Despite having a 6.2-yard average depth of target, Rice has five gains of 15-plus yards and leads all receivers in total yards after catch (118). He’s averaging 9.8 yards after the catch per reception and ranks fifth in yards per route run (3.49). 5. [Chris Olave](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/chris-olave/84355), [New Orleans Saints](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-orleans-saints/20) (83.4) Olave rebounded quickly from his 11-yard day against Carolina with a 39-yard catch on the opening drive of his Week 2 game.

    "text": "HUNT, Texas — On Friday morning, many people had only minutes to escape the raging floodwaters of the Guadalupe River in Hunt — including the Vlasek family, who live in a small neighborhood across Highway 39.\n“This was the living room. We had a chair here and a couch there,” said Cody Vlasek, a senior at Ingram Tom Moore High School who has spent his entire childhood in the home.\n\"The back fence is where the 100-year flood plain ends, and we’re 20 — almost 30 — feet away from that,” he added.\nCody said his mother, Denise, woke up to the sound of heavy rain. Soon after, he realized the water was rising fast. He started yelling to his parents that it was time to go.\n“The river was to our back fence,” Cody said.\nThe three of them rushed to get out. Amid the chaos, their dog ran off. With no time to search, they were forced to leave their pet behind and began making their way uphill to a neighbor’s home. Cody said the water was already up to his waist.\n“The current — it almost, almost tripped some of us,” he recalled.\nWithin 20 minutes, the floodwaters had filled their home. Cody said they could hear neighbors yelling for help.\n“It was a horrible feeling because you wanted to help them, and you didn’t know what happened to them,” he said. “But you knew, deep down, if you tried going out there, something would happen to you as well.”\nAll they could do was wait for the water to recede. Fortunately, the neighbors who had called for help were safe.\nWhen Cody finally made it back to his home, he was met with a small miracle.\n“I had to break my window, and when I climbed through, I heard scratching and a whimper. I turned my head around the corner and saw him — just floating in the washer,” Cody said.\nHis dog had survived — found alive inside the washing machine.\nWhile the Vlasek family is relieved to be safe and reunited with their dog, they are also facing a grim reality: several people they knew didn’t survive.\n“You can replace a house, but you can’t replace lives,” Cody said.",

    "text": "Región Central\nTrabajadores de Unitrauma del Tolima exigen garantías en pago de sueldos y cesantías\nMédicos, enfermeros y administrativos, se sienten vulnerados. Ya han despedido a las personas que han denunciado públicamente.\nCompartir:\nLos lesionados fueron trasladados de urgencia a centros asistenciales. Por fortuna no tienen heridas de gravedad.\nAlerta Tolima\nEn una situación alarmante, los trabajadores de Unitrauma en el Tolima denunciaron la falta de pago de sus sueldos y cesantías, lo que ha llevado a un clima de incertidumbre y descontento en la institución. A través de una denuncia anónima, un grupo de empleados expuso su situación, revelando que muchos de sus compañeros han sido despedidos por expresar públicamente sus reclamos.\n“No nos dan el apoyo que requerimos. Muchos compañeros han sido despedidos por denunciar públicamente, y ningún administrativo nos da razón de nuestro dinero. No tenemos especialistas”, afirmó la denunciante, quien prefirió mantenerse en el anonimato por temor a represalias. La situación ha afectado no sólo a los trabajadores, sino también a los pacientes que acuden a la entidad en busca de atención médica.\nCabe resaltar que hay pacientes que llevan más de cuatro días esperando ser atendidos debido a la falta de personal en Unitrauma, Tolima. La escasez de recursos humanos ha generado un colapso en la atención, lo que pone en riesgo la salud de quienes requieren servicios médicos urgentes.\nLea también: Autoridades revelan detalles del millonario hurto en un banco en Cundinamarca\nLos trabajadores de Unitrauma manifestaron que llevan tres meses sobreviviendo con un solo sueldo, lo que ha generado una crisis económica para muchos de ellos. Según los denunciantes, los afectados incluyen auxiliares de enfermería, médicos, administrativos y otros profesionales que dependen de sus salarios para cubrir sus necesidades básicas.\n“La gerente no nos da la cara. En estos momentos están haciendo contratos con laboratorios clínicos y manejan rayos X particulares. Nos dicen que no pagan las EPS y que por esa razón no nos cumplen con los sueldos”, agregó la denunciante, señalando la falta de transparencia en la gestión administrativa de la unidad de salud.\nLa situación ha despertado la preocupación de la comunidad y de las autoridades sanitarias, quienes han sido instadas a intervenir para garantizar tanto el pago a los trabajadorescomo la atención a los pacientes. La falta de respuesta por parte de la dirección de Unitrauma ha generado un clima de tensión y desconfianza entre los empleados, que sienten que sus derechos laborales están siendo vulnerados.\nLe puede interesar: Primicia: indígenas emberá retornarán a sus territorios este viernes tras acuerdo con el Gobierno\nLos trabajadores han solicitado la intervención de las autoridades competentes para resolver esta crisis, esperando que se tomen medidas que permitan regularizar los pagos y mejorar las condiciones laborales.

    "title": "Truck drivers describe LMIA exploitation, abuse - Truck News",
    "text": "“When you are on a LMIA work permit you have to deal with shit!”\nThat’s how truck drivers described the potentially deadly, unsafe and toxic working conditions they endured as unscrupulous trucking company owners allegedly exploited them using Canada’s labor market impact assessment (LMIA) program.\nTwo drivers — whose names have been withheld for fear of retribution, including deportation — claim they were ordered to work without resets stipulated by Hours-of-Service rules by using other drivers’ logins on the electronic logging device (ELD).\nThe men told TruckNews.com they were forced to drive when injured, sick and exhausted with lack of sleep and rest. They say they were coerced into breaking cabotage rules in the U.S and driving unsafe vehicles. They had wages deducted and were not paid for layovers, pickups and drops.\nSam, left, shows the addresses where they picked up and dropped off freight within the U.S. Moe, right, displays a pay statement. (Photo: Leo Barros) When an employer in Canada is unable to find an employee – a Canadian or permanent resident – with a certain skill set for their business, they can file an LMIA application with Employment and Social Development Canada to hire a foreign worker. Workers should not have to pay for the LMIA.\nDriver paid thousands of dollars for LMIA However, “Moe” paid thousands of dollars to two trucking companies for an LMIA, based on which he could work as a truck driver and stay in Canada, as time on his student visa-linked work permit was running out.\nA trucking company owner in Brampton, Ont., demanded $20,000. Moe gave him $7,000. He was paid 24 cents a mile working as a longhaul driver, hauling loads from Ontario to New Brunswick, Manitoba and Alberta.\nNeeding to boost his earnings, Moe sought work with a Surrey, B.C.-based carrier. The company owner demanded $5,000 for an LMIA. Moe paid and began working for 28 cents a mile as a longhaul driver, with a promise that pay would increase every three months.\nCarriers demand $40,000 Moe’s buddy “Sam” – a former student on a work permit – was also looking for an LMIA to help extend his stay in Canada. Sam claimed trucking companies in Brampton were demanding $30,000 to $40,000.\nWhen Moe told him about his company’s $5,000 “fee,” Sam decided to test the waters. He contacted the company owner, who immediately upped the LMIA charges to $10,000. Sam told the owner that he didn’t need an LMIA at the moment. He was hired as a longhaul team driver and agreed to haul freight for 28 cents a mile.\nPressure on driver He and Moe began working as team drivers and working conditions soon turned sour. They say the company owner kept pressuring Sam to pay $2,000, saying the LMIA was ready, but he refused to cave in.\nThe owner stopped paying for layovers, which sometimes lasted for days. The company would issue a pay statement to Moe with the miles completed outlining the amount owed to him. Then, a pay stub with a lesser amount would be deposited into his bank account.\nMoe’s pay statement for two weeks in Feb. 2024. (Photo: Supplied) Moe’s pay stub for two weeks of work in Feb. 2024. (Photo: Supplied) Sam and Moe said miles completed were not calculated from pick-up to drop-off, but from a major city or town to another. The drivers said they delivered freight away from the city on numerous occasions and the extra miles were not added to their wages.\nThe drivers said they were ordered to break cabotage rules in the U.S. Canadian carriers are prohibited from engaging in moving freight from point to point within the U.S. They said the company threatened to withhold their wages if they refused. They also allege the company provided a fake bill of lading, showing only multiple drops in the U.S. while they moved freight from state to state within that country.\nA bill of lading showing freight being moved within the U.S., breaking cabotage rules. (Photo: Supplied) A fictitious bill of lading issued by the trucking company to cover up breaking of cabotage rules in the U.S. (Photo: Supplied) Sam and Moe said on numerous occasions when due for a reset after their 70-hour clocks ran out, they were told to keep driving. They said the company owner provided other drivers’ ELD logins and sometimes his own, so they could continue hauling freight beyond legally allowable hours.\nMoe recalled an incident in which he was driving a truck with a rebuilt engine that was leaking diesel. He was hauling freight from Ontario to B.C. The engine began smoking near North Bay, Ont., he recalls.\nDriving unsafe vehicles He was told to pour water on the engine and continue west to Edmonton, where it would be serviced. He did so and kept going. Then the coolant began draining. The solution offered was to fill the container with water.\nIn Regina, when the dashboard started to light up with warning messages, the owner asked him to use an override button and continue. The truck broke down in Lloydminster, Alta. Moe paid $800 for the service call and the owner did not reimburse him. He also paid for a flight back to Toronto.\nMoe recalled that before Sam and he drove as a team, he’d injured his left arm while shutting a trailer door in B.C. His teammate at the time told him he’d have to continue driving. Moe said he drove two 12-hour shifts mostly one-handed with a badly bruised and painful left arm.\nAfter completing the trip, he informed the company that he would need time to recover. He was told that since he was on an LMIA work permit he’d have to get back to work. He hauled a load from Ontario to Montreal and back while injured.\nWorking through injury A few months ago, during a trip from Vancouver, B.C., to Ontario, Moe fell from the truck and injured his arm during a shift change. Sam had just completed his 12-hour shift. Sam called the company owner describing the situation. He said he didn’t inquire about Moe’s condition but instead began abusing him. He ordered Sam to continue driving on Moe’s clock to deliver the load.\nSam drove another 12 hours and delivered the load. They then went to a hospital at 2 a.m. so that Moe could be treated. Since the company did not provide insurance, Moe paid out of pocket for the treatment.\nFor Moe and Sam, this was the final straw, and they began looking for another employer.\nThe silver lining For the past two months they have been employed by a Mississauga, Ont.-based trucking company. “They don’t ask for money for an LMIA, they are nice people,” a beaming Moe said.\nThey are now paid properly, get layover pay, pick-up and drop-off payments, days off and receive health and insurance coverage. “This is something new for us,” Moe added. “The difference is like night and day.”\nHe recently received an invitation to become a permanent resident and is looking forward to settling into his trucking career. Sam is in the immigration pool, hoping for a similar invitation. For many others, there is no silver lining to their cloud of exploitation and misery.\nLMIA abuse detrimental to trucking",
