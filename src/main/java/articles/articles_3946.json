Vibration meters are the basic data logger devices representing machine vibration readings. Most vibration meters are battery-operated and consist of monochrome or digital LCD. These devices are portable and present a simple and convenient way to monitor vibrations. However, unlike vibration analyzers, they provide simple readings onscreen with no alarm level or reference to the previous readings or perhaps vibration standards in rotating machines. Further, portable vibration analyzers are effective, convenient, accurate, and mobile tools that have feature memories to store the vibration measurement data for further analysis. On-premises segment is expected to hold a substantial market share during the forecast period. Machine condition monitoring solutions and systems are deployed at the user's premises to ensure complete control over the data flow, enabling data security. This is one of the key reasons for adopting the on-premises machine condition monitoring solutions and systems. On-premises machine condition monitoring solutions and systems collect real-time data with high accuracy, reducing the response time to resolve issues. Machine condition monitoring solutions deployed on the company premises ensure complete control and security of its data. This leads to increased adoption of on-premises solutions. However, high installation, setup, and maintenance costs restrict the adoption of on-premises deployment of machine condition monitoring solutions and systems. Aerospace industry segment to grow at an impressive CAGR during the forecast period. Aerospace is a rapidly growing industry, and there is a constant need to enhance the reliability of machines to avoid production losses occurring due to machinery breakdowns. In aircraft manufacturing, more than one condition monitoring technology is used to monitor the condition of critical machines, resulting in the generation of large volumes of data. Advanced algorithms are used to develop condition monitoring systems and solutions to accommodate various analytical technologies. The use of artificial intelligence for condition monitoring enables companies to efficiently detect potential faults in machinery, thereby minimizing production losses.

    "title": "All-round Dube helps India freeze out Afghanistan in chilly T20 opener - Breitbart",
    "text": "All-rounder Shivam Dube defied bitterly cold weather to hit an unbeaten half-century and take one wicket as India eased to a comfortable win over Afghanistan in the first Twenty20 international on Thursday. Dube, a left-handed batsman, made 60 off 40 balls for his second T20 fifty as India chased down their victory target of 159 with 15 balls and six wickets to spare at Mohali. India lead the three-match series 1-0 as they prepare for the T20 World Cup in June. India’s bowlers led by spinner Axar Patel restricted Afghanistan to 158-5 despite an attacking 42 by Mohammad Nabi on a chilly winter evening. Temperatures plummeted to just nine degrees (48 Fahrenheit) in the northern city where summer heat can soar to a scorching 40-plus degrees. Some players were seen using hand warmers to keep out the bone-jarring chill. “It was extremely cold to be honest,” returning skipper Rohit Sharma, who was run out for a duck after a mix up with Shubman Gill, said after the win. He added: “There were a lot of positives, especially with the ball. Wasn’t the easiest of conditions but our spinners bowled particularly well.” Axar and fast bowler Mukesh Kumar took two wickets each while Dube returned figures of 1-9 from his two overs of medium-pace bowling. But it was his batting that made the difference as he steered the chase with key partnerships including a 45-run stand with Jitesh Sharma, who made 31, and an unbeaten 42 with Rinku Singh, 16 not out. The 30-year-old Dube won the game with a six and four and was named man of the match. Rohit returned to lead India after over a year’s absence in the T20 format and elected to field first. Afghanistan skipper Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmanullah Gurbaz put on 50 for the opening wicket before the Indian bowlers hit back with Axar returning figures of 2-23. Axar, a left-arm spinner, had Gurbaz stumped for 23 and Zadran fell to Dube, who had earlier dropped the skipper on one, on 25. Rahmat Shah had a forgettable debut after he was bowled by Axar for three but Nabi came in to steady the innings and then launch an attack with Omarzai. Kumar cut short Omarzai’s innings on 29. Nabi smashed three sixes and two fours in his 27-ball knock before falling to Kumar. “We were quite lazy with the fielding today,” Zadran said. “We will try to improve batting as well. Bowling we have no issue. Will focus on what we did wrong today.” India’s Virat Kohli missed the game due to “personal reasons” while Afghanistan spin king Rashid Khan remains out of the series as he recovers from a back surgery. The second match is in Indore on Sunday.",

    "text": "PALERMO (ITALPRESS) – Via libera all’assunzione di 255 agenti del Corpo forestale della Regione Siciliana nel corso del 2025. Lo ha stabilito il governo Schifani apprezzando, nella seduta odierna di giunta, la proposta di scorrimento della graduatoria della procedura concorsuale del 2021, avviata utilizzando le risorse previste dal Piano integrato di attività e organizzazione (Piao) 2025-2027. Altri 114 idonei potranno successivamente entrare nel Corpo forestale nel 2026. Le assunzioni, nel biennio, saranno in tutto 369. E’ quanto si legge in una nota della Regione Siciliana.\nNei prossimi mesi di quest’anno, dunque, sottolinea la nota, l’organico si rafforzerà con i 46 vincitori iniziali del concorso e con 208 nuovi reclutamenti, dei quali 20 unità in comando e 188 provenienti dallo scorrimento della graduatoria. Una sola unità sarà integrata in ottemperanza di una sentenza del tribunale di Termini Imerese, in seguito a contenzioso.\n“Oggi – afferma l’assessore al Territorio e all’ambiente, Giusi Savarino – viene compiuto quel passo avanti atteso da tempo nella riforma e nella riorganizzazione del settore, un punto di svolta nella soluzione delle criticità derivanti dalla carenza di personale. Abbiamo puntato a velocizzare le assunzioni attraverso lo scorrimento della graduatoria dell’ultimo concorso, facendo leva su una recente norma nazionale. Otteniamo così un notevole risparmio di tempo e di risorse per la pubblica amministrazione e andiamo incontro alle legittime aspettative di tanti giovani siciliani risultati idonei, che da tempo attendevano risposte. Ora finalmente potranno entrare in servizio. Quello del Corpo forestale – aggiunge l’assessore – è personale qualificato, in divisa, assunto con un corso-concorso per cui gli idonei, una volta esperita la visita medica, verranno adeguatamente preparati ad assolvere al loro importante compito di prevenzione, tutela ambientale, difesa del nostro territorio e di valorizzazione del patrimonio boschivo”.\nPropedeutica all’avvio delle procedure di assunzione sarà l’approvazione del rendiconto della Regione. A rendere possibile lo scorrimento della graduatoria del concorso espletato nel 2021, una norma nazionale (decreto legge del 14 marzo 2025) applicabile dall’amministrazione regionale, conclude la nota\n– Foto IPA Agency –\n(ITALPRESS)\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ddb4b3bbb29db4a9bcb1adafb8aeaef3beb2b0)",

    "text": "Scientists have developed a novel approach to improve neuroprostheses, making them more precise and practical for everyday tasks. By analyzing neural signals linked to hand postures, researchers demonstrated enhanced control of virtual hands in rhesus monkeys, closely mimicking fine motor skills. This study suggests that hand postures, rather than movement speed, are key to better controlling prostheses, bridging damaged nerve connections for tasks like grasping. With this advance, future neuroprostheses could restore fine motor abilities for individuals with paralysis or neurodegenerative diseases, transforming everyday functionality. Key Facts: - Focusing on hand posture signals improved precision in neuroprosthesis control. - Virtual hand movements closely matched real hand postures in trained rhesus monkeys. - Findings offer potential to enhance fine motor skills in future hand prostheses. Source: DPZ Carrying shopping bags, pulling a thread into the eye of a needle – power and precision grips are part of our everyday lives. We only realize how important (and great) our hands are when we can no longer use them, for example due to paraplegia or diseases such as ALS, which cause progressive muscle paralysis. In order to help patients, scientists have been researching neuroprostheses for decades. These artificial hands, arms or legs could give people with disabilities their mobility back. Damaged nerve connections are bridged via brain-computer interfaces that decode the signals from the brain, translate them into movements and can thus control the prosthesis. Until now, however, hand prostheses in particular have lacked the necessary fine motor skills to be used in everyday life. “How well a prosthesis works depends primarily on the neural data read by the computer interface that controls it,” says Andres Agudelo-Toro, scientist in the Neurobiology Laboratory at the German Primate Center and first author of the study. “Previous studies on arm and hand movements have focused on the signals that control the velocity of a grasping movement. We wanted to find out whether neural signals representing hand postures might be better suited to control neuroprostheses.” For the study, the researchers worked with rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Like humans, they have a highly developed nervous and visual system as well as pronounced fine motor skills. This makes them particularly suitable for researching grasping movements. To prepare for the main experiment, the scientists trained two rhesus monkeys to move a virtual avatar hand on a screen. During this training phase, the monkeys performed the hand movements with their own hand while simultaneously seeing the corresponding movement of the virtual hand on the screen. A data glove with magnetic sensors, which the monkeys wore during the task, recorded the animals’ hand movements. Once the monkeys had learned the task, they were trained to control the virtual hand in a next step by “imagining” the grip. The activity of populations of neurons in the cortical brain areas that are specifically responsible for controlling hand movements was measured. The researchers focused on the signals that represent the different hand and finger postures, and adapted the algorithm of the brain-computer interface, which translates the neural data into movement, in a corresponding protocol. “Deviating from the classic protocol, we adapted the algorithm so that not only the destination of a movement is important, but also how you get there, i.e., the path of execution,” explains Andres Agudelo-Toro. “This ultimately led to the most accurate results.” The researchers then compared the movements of the avatar hand with the data of the real hand that they had previously recorded and were able to show that these were executed with comparable precision. “In our study, we were able to show that the signals that control the posture of a hand are particularly important for controlling a neuroprosthesis,” says Hansjörg Scherberger, head of the Neurobiology Laboratory and senior author of the study. “These results can now be used to improve the functionality of future brain-computer interfaces and thus also to improve the fine motor skills of neural prostheses.” Funding: The study was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, grants FOR-1847 and SFB-889) and by the European Union Horizon 2020 project B-CRATOS (GA 965044).

Neuron Abstract Accurate neural control of a hand prothesis by posture-related activity in the primate grasping circuit Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore hand movement for people with paralysis, but current devices still lack the fine control required to interact with objects of daily living. Following our understanding of cortical activity during arm reaches, hand BCI studies have focused primarily on velocity control. However, mounting evidence suggests that posture, and not velocity, dominates in hand-related areas. To explore whether this signal can causally control a prosthesis, we developed a BCI training paradigm centered on the reproduction of posture transitions. Monkeys trained with this protocol were able to control a multidimensional hand prosthesis with high accuracy, including execution of the very intricate precision grip. Analysis revealed that the posture signal in the target grasping areas was the main contributor to control. We present, for the first time, neural posture control of a multidimensional hand prosthesis, opening the door for future interfaces to leverage this additional information channel.",

Su reclamo tiene que ver con los resultados de las elecciones presidenciales del 28 de julio, cuando el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) proclamó ganador de Nicolás Maduro pese a no presentar aún las actas detalladas del proceso. El organismo electoral del país, así como la administración de Maduro, denunció un presunto sabotaje y hackeo que llevó a retrasar el anuncio de los resultados. Frente al anuncio del triunfo del oficialista, se desataron numerosas manifestaciones en el país los días posteriores a las votaciones, acciones que dejaron, según cifras de Maduro, [más de dos mil detenidos hasta el momento](https://www.analitica.com/actualidad/actualidad-nacional/sucesos/foro-penal-registra-decenas-de-adolescentes-detenidos-por-protestas/) entre civiles y figuras de la política. “La única dictadura acá es la de las redes sociales (…) que se ponen al frente a promover insurgencias, golpes de Estado”, comentó Delcy Rodríguez este 8 de agosto. Según la vicepresidenta, se notan incongruencias entre las actas mostradas por la oposición, con “fallecidos votando”. Asimismo, reclamó que hay falta de datos al respecto, como los de los miembros de mesa, actas incompletas e ilegibles, así como numerosas firmas.",
