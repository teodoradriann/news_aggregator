    "text": "Africa-Press – Liberia. LBA General Secretary Calvin Diggs stated that this decision aims to encourage the participation of young athletes and provide them with a platform to showcase their talents.\nThe Liberia Basketball Association (LBA) has announced an age limit of 25 for players interested in participating in the National County Sports Meet (NCSM), which officially kicks off on January 21, 2025.\nIn previous editions, the NCSM was open to players of all ages, allowing even ex-President George M. Weah to represent Grand Kru County. However, the LBA, the governing body for basketball in the country, has decided to implement a ban on players over the age of 25, making them ineligible for future competitions.\nLBA General Secretary Calvin Diggs stated that this decision aims to encourage the participation of young athletes and provide them with a platform to showcase their talents.\nHe emphasized that it is in the best interest of the LBA to scout promising talents for the various youth national teams, who can eventually progress to the senior level.\nDiggs remarked, “By setting this age limit, we will give more young players the chance to develop and enhance the overall competitiveness of the event. The National County Sports Meet aims to foster national unity and discover talent for national teams, so the LBA must adequately support the development of young players and provide equal opportunities for them to showcase their skills.”\nWhen contacted, Deputy Minister for Sports G. Andy Quamie confirmed that the age limit set by the LBA would be enforced.\nMinister Quamie stated that each federation or association has its own rules governing competition. “We are simply the organizers, so we will adhere to the regulations established by all associations and federations for the benefit of the National County Sports Meet,” he added.\nFor More News And Analysis About Liberia Follow Africa-Press",
