    "title": "Cerca de 300 empleados quedarían en la calle debido a la cancelación de fondos federales en el Departamento de Salud",
    "text": "27 de marzo de 2025 - 6:39 PM\nAlrededor de 300 trabajadores contratados a través del Departamento de Salud para labores en los 78 municipios quedarán sin empleo a partir de este lunes, 31 de marzo, a raíz de la recién anunciada pérdida de $45 millones en fondos federales en esa agencia estatal, confirmaron por separado alcaldes consultados.\n“Ellos son los más que se ven afectados”, sostuvo el presidente de la Asociación de Alcaldes, Jorge González, al señalar que el impacto es abarcador, si se toma en cuenta que se trata de trabajadores que han estado ofreciendo un servicio directo a la población en cada municipio.\n“Sabemos que esos fondos federales tenían una fecha de terminación, pero estamos hablando de que se afectan servicios y se queda gente sin empleo”, señaló el alcalde Jayuya.\nGonzález, quien representa a los alcaldes afiliados al Partido Popular Democrático , enfatizó que los ejecutivos municipales no han recibido todavía una notificación oficial sobre la eliminación de los fondos, más allá de una llamada telefónica de personal del Departamento de Salud a la Asociación, advirtiendo que la facturación de los empleados será solo hasta el 31 de marzo.\nGonzález urgió al secretario designado de Salud, Víctor Ramos Otero, quien este jueves estuvo sujeto a un intenso interrogatorio en Comisión Total del Senado, a mejorar la comunicación con los alcaldes.\nDesde el lunes, los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, en inglés) –que pertenecen al Departamento de Salud federal– comenzaron a notificar la intención de cancelar $11,400 millones en fondos para mitigar el COVID-19 asignados a gobiernos estatales y locales, así como a organizaciones no gubernamentales e internacionales.\nEsa cancelación implicó una pérdida de $45,184,786, de una asignación total de $290,339,790, para atender la emergencia de COVID-19 y otras iniciativas de salud pública en Puerto Rico, indicó, a principios de semana, Ramos Otero por escrito. Pese a varios intentos, el secretario designado no ha estado disponible para responder preguntas de este medio.\nLuego que fuera declarada la pandemia de COVID-19, en marzo de 2020, la asignación de fondos federales permitió crear equipos municipales de rastreo y monitoreo de casos, una medida que fue fundamental para el control de contagios en etapas críticas de la entonces emergencia de salud pública.\nLa cantidad de trabajadores en estos equipos fue mermando a medida que se controlaban los contagios y muertes, hasta que el 11 de mayo de 2024 se puso fin a la emergencia. La declaración de pandemia, sin embargo, permanece activa por parte de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS). Aunque ya no existe una emergencia, en Puerto Rico se han reportado 14 muertes asociadas a COVID-19 el último mes, y al menos, 1,128 casos en la última semana.\nEl Departamento de Salud no ha precisado cuántos trabajadores integran estos equipos actualmente a nivel isla. Pero, tanto González como su homólogo en la Federación de Alcaldes, Gabriel Hernández, promediaron unos cuatro por grupo, lo que equivaldría a 312 trabajadores entre todos los municipios.\nAdemás de continuar el monitoreo de casos y proveer pruebas caseras del coronavirus, entre otros servicios asociados a la pandemia, el alcalde de Aguada, Christian Cortés, explicó que estos equipos habían ampliado sus funciones, tomando en cuenta, por ejemplo, la epidemia de dengue.\n“Ya el equipo había asumido roles de Oficina de Salud Pública, una primera línea de orientación y cernimiento de enfermedades respiratorias y arbovirales”, precisó Cortés, quien precisó que, en el caso de Aguada, se trata de tres trabajadores que, a partir de este viernes, cesarán en sus puestos.\n“En el caso de Aguada, cerramos el viernes la Oficina de Salud Pública”, anotó el alcalde. Cortés indicó que, aunque exista el deseo, para la administración municipal resulta imposible contratar este personal –que es especializado– de manera directa. Cuando se crearon los equipos, por ejemplo, cada uno contaba con un epidemiólogo.\n“La realidad es que el municipio no aguanta otra carga presupuestaria”, anotó el alcalde. “Representa otro impacto para aquellos municipios que decidan incluir a los empleados en nómina”.\nSobre este asunto, el presidente de la Asociación de Alcaldes recordó que los ayuntamientos se encuentran en una difícil situación económica y fiscal, y que lidian con asuntos como la eliminación del Fondo de Equiparación.\n“Para poder contratar, tenemos que tener los presupuestos y que sea de manera recurrente. No contamos con dinero para hacerlo”, añadió el presidente de la Federación de Alcaldes, que reúne a los ejecutivos del Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP).\nHernández indicó que los alcaldes sabían que era cuestión de tiempo, la eliminación de estos equipos, cuya existencia había sido extendida por última vez en diciembre, aunque no había certeza de que las contrataciones continuaran más allá de junio.\nSumado a este asunto, se prevé otro impacto para los trabajadores del sector salubrista en la isla, ya que el Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos federal (HHS, en inglés) anunció este jueves una reestructuración significativa que resultará en el despido de 10,000 empleados en Estados Unidos, que se suman a otras 10,000 bajas que se han dado por medio de jubilaciones o renuncias ofrecidas por medio del programa creado por el asesor especial del presidente Donald Trump, el multimillonario Elon Musk.\nLas cesantías afectarán a 3,500 empleados de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA), 2,400 de los CDC y 1,200 de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud (NIH). También se afectarán 300 trabajadores de los Centros de Servicios Medicare y Medicaid (CMS). Aunque el anuncio no especificó el impacto directo en Puerto Rico, los despidos recientes en agencias federales han tenido repercusiones en la isla.\nLas noticias explicadas de forma sencilla y directa para entender lo más importante del día.\nTe invitamos a descargar cualquiera de estos navegadores para ver nuestras noticias:",

    "title": "Presidente Petro le jaló las orejas a los empresarios; abogó por mejores salarios y dejar “el látigo” contra los trabajadores",
    "text": "Durante la exposición del balance de su Gobierno durante el 2023, el presidente Gustavo Petro hizo énfasis en las intenciones que tiene para los trabajadores colombianos y que contempla en el proyecto de reforma laboral que hace tránsito en el Congreso de la República.Puntualmente, insistió en su objetivo de que “los trabajadores y trabajadoras de Colombia tengan mejores salarios, más descanso y mayor estabilidad laboral” . Durante su alocución, el jefe de Estado también se refirió a los proyectos de reforma pensional, a la salud, a los servicios públicos domiciliarios y a la minería.“ La reforma laboral propone que, si usted es un asalariado, se le pague el doble si trabaja en festivos y dominicales, o si trabaja en horarios nocturnos . Se trata de recuperar no solo un mejor salario y recuperar el descanso, sino mejorar la estabilidad laboral”, expuso el mandatario.“No es el látigo, sino la inteligencia”El presidente también aprovechó la ocasión para lanzar una crítica directa a los empresarios que ven en las largar jornadas laborales la única estrategia para aumentar la productividad.A renglón seguido, consideró que “la ganancia no se extrae por extender la jornada laboral al máximo, transformar a la trabajadora en un objeto desechable, sin ninguna estabilidad, o sobrexplotar al máximo la fuerza laboral”. “No es el látigo, sino la inteligencia y la máquina lo que hace más productivo al trabajador”, enfatizó.De paso, subrayó que es necesario que el empresariado colombiano entienda que la ganancia crece con una fuerza laboral “más estable, educada y productiva”.“ Entre más productividad tiene la fuerza laboral, más altos pueden ser sus salarios reales, más rica es la sociedad y más ganancias crecen en el país ”, señaló el presidente.Sobre la reforma pensionalEn relación a la reforma pensional, el mandatario de los colombianos recalcó que el objetivo primordial es que “millones de ancianos y ancianas que hoy recorren las plazas del país buscando sobrevivir, tengan un bono pensional similar a la renta ciudadana”. Para lograrlo, explicó que “el programa se puede financiar precisamente con el presupuesto que se liberaría si el Estado deja de subsidiar a los actuales pensionados y sus pensiones, y estas se financian con las cotizaciones que se quedan en administración en los fondos privados y que, en su mitad, van al extranjero”.A su vez, agregó que “una verdadera pensión se logra con el retorno de esos recursos y con un régimen pensional solidario para garantizar que la mayoría de los actuales cotizantes accedan a ese derecho”. Se alista mesa de concertación sobre la reforma laboralLa reforma laboral del Gobierno de Gustavo Petro no ha pasado por un trámite que es indispensable para que el proyecto de ley pueda aplicarse: una mesa de concertación entre los trabajadores, los empresarios y el poder Ejecutivo sobre su contenido.Ese proyecto de ley está ad portas de terminar su primer debate en la Comisión Séptima de la Cámara de Representantes y los empresarios están esperando el llamado del Gobierno para participar de la mesa de concertación sobre el articulado.El presidente de la ANDI, Bruce Mac Master, señaló en conversación con SEMANA que ya han hablando con el Gobierno Petro para que esa instancia tenga lugar en enero y respondió que han visto voluntad de parte del Ejecutivo para llevarla a cabo. “Nosotros hemos planteado siempre, porque además la ley lo dice así, que las reformas laborales tienen que llevarse a la mesa de concertación. Esta última reforma, o este último proyecto de reforma, no ha sido llevado allá. Entonces, hemos hablado con el Gobierno de que muy temprano en enero llevemos la reforma allá y tratemos de producir que sea resultado de la mesa de concertación ”, indicó.Luego, consultado sobre si se ha visto voluntad de parte de la administración de Gustavo Petro para convocar a esa instancia, el representante de los empresarios respondió que “ el Gobierno ha demostrado su disposición a hacerlo”. El primer semestre de 2024 será determinante para definir el futuro de la reforma laboral. Vale recordar que el proyecto de ley se hundió en junio de 2023, en el primer intento del Ministerio de Trabajo de tramitarlo, y ahora va por su segundo paso por el Congreso que estudia a la par las otras reformas radicadas por el presidente Petro: la pensional, la de educación y la propuesta de reforma a la salud.",
