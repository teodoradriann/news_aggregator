Every day he collects and distributes 500 kg of fruits and vegetables to sustain forest animals. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 05-07-2024 18:49 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 18:49 IST - Country: - India In the lush landscapes of Kerala, 74-year-old Kallur Balan, renowned as the 'Green Man', is on an enduring mission to restore and nurture the environment. Balan, a native of Kallur in Palakkad district, has devoted his life to the forest and its creatures, planting lakhs of trees and providing food and water daily to wild animals and birds. Every morning, Balan embarks on a rigorous routine. After his mountain climb and yoga session, he sets out in his Jeep by six o'clock, traveling over 50 kilometers to collect 500 kg of fruits and vegetables. By eight o'clock, he returns and begins distributing the produce in forest areas, including Aiyarmala, Kinavallur, Vazhukappara, Mundur, Dhonimala, and Walayar. The sight of Balan's Jeep draws animals from monkeys to wild boars out of the forest, eager for the food. Local wholesalers from Palakkad to Ottapalam generously supply Balan with fruits and vegetables, while acquaintances fund his fuel. Since 2000, Balan has planted and nurtured over 30 lakh tree saplings, transforming arid landscapes into verdant havens and earning him the affectionate title of 'Balettan' among locals.",

    "text": "An Apple AirTag has helped ACT Policing recover 21 stolen e-bikes and electric scooters, which were found after the search of a home in Ngunnawal yesterday (28 December).\nIn December 2022, an e-bike that had an AirTag fixed to it was stolen. Earlier this month, the AirTag transmitted its location to the owner and police sought a search warrant for a home in Ngunnawal.\nGungahlin Station general duties officers executed the search warrant yesterday and located the stolen e-bike, as well as other items believed to be stolen.\nIn total, six e-bikes, 15 electric scooters, a car trailer and number plates were recovered during the warrant.\nThe estimated value of the recovered goods is more than $30,000. Inquiries in relation to the recovered goods are continuing.\nACT Policing is reminding Canberrans to record details of items such as bikes, scooters and other portable items, as information like serial numbers and images of the items can be useful to provide to police and insurers if an item is stolen.\nBike and scooter owners should also register the details of their item at\nBikelinc . This allows the quick return of items if recovered by police. It also makes it more difficult for stolen items to be on-sold, with prospective buyers able to check if an item has been reported stolen.\nIf you believe you are the rightful owner of any of the items recovered (that have not already been reported to police) and can provide proof of ownership, please contact police on 131 444 quoting reference 7631621.\nAnyone with any information about the theft and sale of goods such as bikes and scooters should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000, or via the Crime Stoppers ACT website. Information can be provided anonymously.",

    "text": "[Back to News](/news)\nSeptember 19, 2024\nNSSF Urges All Gun Owners and Second Amendment Supporters to Register to Vote and #GUNVOTE® on November 5th\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – NSSF®, the Firearm Industry Trade Association, announced it is urging all gun owners, hunters, recreational target shooters and supporters of the Second Amendment to register to vote by visiting\nwww.GunVote.org and on Election Day, November 5th, to not risk their rights and #GUNVOTE®\nWith less than 50 days until Election Day, several states are beginning to send out mail ballots and offering advanced in-person voting. NSSF’s #GUNVOTE voter education campaign seeks to ensure all gun owners and hunters are registered to vote and educated about where the candidates stand on the Second Amendment.\n“For millions of Americans who cherish their Second Amendment rights, this truly is the most critical election in history. Vice President Kamala Harris has clearly laid out her anti-gun agenda. It is abundantly clear she will continue the Biden-Harris attack on the Second Amendment and will restrict the rights of law-abiding Americans even more than she has over the past three and a half years,” said Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF Senior Vice President and General Counsel. “In 2020, the presidential election swung in just a few key states by margins of a few thousand votes and hanging chads. Reporting shows there are more than 10 million hunters and Second Amendment supporters who remain unregistered to vote ahead of the 2024 election. Make sure you’re registered. Check that your hunting and range buddies are registered too. Visit\nwww.GunVote.org for all the information you need to get registered and to find your polling place to make sure you Don’t Risk Your Rights® on November 5th.”\nReports have show millions of Americans who enjoy hunting, the recreational shooting sports and lawfully owning firearms for self-defense still have yet to register to vote. That includes more than 515,277 in Pennsylvania and 370,000 each in Michigan and North Carolina. In addition, Georgia, Wisconsin, Missouri and Virginia all have more than half a million hunters and gun owners that remain unregistered and in Arizona – another state that could swing the election – that number totals approximately 133,000.\nNSSF’s #GUNVOTE initiative was created to ensure all law-abiding American gun owners are registered to vote, know when and where to cast their ballot and to make their voices heard on Election Day. #GUNVOTE conveniently lists all U.S. states with links to their respective Secretary of State’s websites where more details about registering to vote, early voting protocols and the entire process can be found. For those who wait until election day to cast their ballot, #GUNVOTE will also tell voters of their polling place so that exercising the right to vote is as easy as possible.\nDon’t Risk Your Rights – #GUNVOTE!\n-30-\nAbout NSSF\nNSSF is the trade association for the firearm industry. Its mission is to promote, protect and preserve hunting and the shooting sports. Formed in 1961, NSSF has a membership of thousands of manufacturers, distributors, firearm retailers, shooting ranges, sportsmen’s organizations and publishers nationwide.

    "text": "Fraser Valley Biogas Project in BC Sets New Record RNG Production [Jov Onsat](/news/Author/82/JovOnsat/ ) Fraser Valley Biogas last month achieved its highest single-day and monthly production of renewable natural gas (RNG) at the biowaste-to-fuel facility in the Canadian province of British Columbia, posting 530 gigajoules (GJ) and 10,758 GJs respectively, the owner has said. The facility can now also process a wider range of feedstock with new equipment commissioned, EverGen Infrastructure Corp. said in a press release. Fraser Valley Biogas’ previous highest monthly production was 9,716 GJs in February. “Our efforts have translated into tangible results as we expect the facility to exceed its nameplate capacity of 160,000 GJs per year once fully ramped up”, EverGen chief executive Mischa Zajtmann said in a statement March 5 announcing the milestone. EverGen said then, “Along with ongoing optimization efforts and the completed installation of the third digester, EverGen remains committed to its production goals and meeting the increasing demands for RNG and low carbon infrastructure in Canada”. The country’s gas utilities have set an aspirational goal of five percent RNG blended into natural gas streams by 2025 and 10 percent by 2030, according to the Canadian Gas Association. Fifteen RNG production facilities have so far been put into operation in Canada, according to the industry group. Last month EverGen announced an agreement to supply RNG from Fraser Valley Biogas, which it acquired 2021, to FortisBC Energy Inc. for 20 years. Vancouver, British Columbia-based EverGen completed the expansion of Fraser Valley Biogas last December, raising its RNG nameplate capacity to 160,000 GJs annually. FortisBC, a Surrey, British Columbia-based natural gas and power utility, will inject the RNG from Fraser Valley Biogas into its natural gas system, EverGen said in a news release June 24. FortisBC operates the interconnection facility at the RNG production facility. “This agreement ensures a stable and predictable supply of RNG for FortisBC, while providing EverGen with a dependable customer and long-term revenue stream”, EverGen said. David Bennett, director for renewable gas and low carbon fuels at FortisBC, commented, “By continuing to increase our RNG supply, we are helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and supporting our vision to have around 75 percent of the gas in our system be renewable and low-carbon by 2050”. Put into service 2011, Fraser Valley Biogas, which processes manure and off-farm organics, is Canada’s first agricultural digester to produce RNG, according to EverGen. RNG, or biomethane, is biogas whose methane content is increased to enable it to be used in place of conventional natural gas. “The RNG generated through this project is part of FortisBC’s program to supply renewable gas to homes, businesses and its customers”, EverGen says on its website. “Fraser Valley Biogas also provides Abbotsford farms with renewable fertilizer via the digestate produced as part of the process”. Simultaneous with the FortisBC agreement announcement, EverGen also said it had inked “a long-term feedstock supply agreement with a waste disposal consolidator in the region”. “The feedstock secured represents greater than 50 percent of the off-farm waste required to achieve nameplate capacity”, it said. Zajtmann said, “With both offtake and feedstock agreements in place on a long-term basis, EverGen has significantly de-risked the FVB project”.

    "text": "IG Metall Says Warning Strikes Of Volkswagen Workers Could Begin Next Week: Reports By RTTNews Staff Writer ✉ | Published: 11/29/2024 9:21 AM ET | Germany's largest union IG Metall has reportedly said Volkswagen AG workers across Germany could begin warning strikes after November 30, which is the last date of an agreement or so-called \"peace obligation\" to not stage strikes. The warning strikes normally last from a few hours up to a day.\nThis move comes after the third collective bargaining negotiations between the union and the carmaker failed to bring about a solution last week. It would mark the first large-scale walkouts at the company's domestic operations since 2018. The next collective bargaining talks are scheduled for December 9 over a new labor agreement.\nThe negotiations were over proposed drastic cost-cutting measures, including a 10 percent cut in wages and cutting of benefits, amid intensifying competition from Chinese rivals, slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and the slowing German economy .\nOne of the solutions reportedly suggested by the union for cutting labor costs is for upper management to forfeit their bonuses. The collective bargaining agreement covers around 120,000 of VW's 300,000 staff in Germany.\nIn late October, Volkswagen announced plans to close at least three factories in Germany, lay off thousands of workers and cut pay by 10 percent of the remaining workers. Volkswagen operates 10 plants and employs around 300,000 people across Germany. This would mark the first time the company has closed domestic plants in its 87-year history.\nUS automaker Ford is also facing a backlash from IG Metall union for its plans to cut thousands of jobs amid restructuring of its production site in Cologne, Germany. On November 20, Ford announced it would cut about 14 percent of its European workforce. In January 2023 also Ford announced plans to cut 3,200 jobs in Europe, mainly in Germany.\nIG Metall is Germany's largest union, representing over 2 million workers in the metals and manufacturing industries, largely in the automotive branch. It also represents workers in the renewables sector involved producing wind turbines and solar panels.\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\nBusiness News\nSlide Shows Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024 Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024 Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024 Previous Story Next Story Global Economics Weekly Update - November 18- 22, 2024 November 22, 2024 09:20 ET Jobless claims and survey data on manufacturing in the U.S. were among the main releases in a light week for economics news flow.
