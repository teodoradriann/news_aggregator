THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods Interim leader Wayne Ewasko had left the door open to a leadership run, but now says he has decided not to enter the race due to family reasons.\nThe Tories recently changed their constitution to allow for online voting in addition to their traditional mail-in ballots.\nBut Brad Zander, head of the party’s leadership committee, says online voting won’t be adopted for this race, partly because of cost concerns.\n“After the election, the party has some ground to make up financially, and with each different option you provide in terms of voting, it increases costs,” Zander said Thursday.\nConcern about introducing a new voting system at a time when party staff and volunteers are already facing other changes was also a factor, Zander said.\nThe Tories overhauled their rules in January in an attempt to avoid the kind of controversy that erupted when Stefanson narrowly won the leadership in the fall of 2021.\nThere was a last-minute surge in party memberships and many members complained they did not receive mail-in ballots in time to vote. An internal review of that race’s problems pointed to other issues, including the possibility that the party’s one-member, one-vote system left it open to a takeover from single-interest outsiders.\nThe new leadership rules require more time between the cutoff of membership sales and the deadline for people to mail in ballots. The rules also tweak the formula for counting votes.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . They continue to allow every Tory member to cast a ballot, but they incorporate a point system to limit the weight of constituencies with big membership numbers. The aim is to ensure that the leadership race cannot be decided by a flood of new members in one or two constituencies.\nThe Tories latest electoral setback was a byelection defeat last week in Stefanson’s Tuxedo seat to the governing New Democrats. The Tories had held that seat ever since its creation in 1979.\nEwasko said the Tories were hampered by an early election call but saw some positive news that multiple candidates sought to be the Tory candidate\n“It was a snap election call by the premier. That being said … the Progressive Conservatives were the only party to hold a (contested nomination) contest,” Ewasko said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024.\nRelated Articles Tories need someone to lead, not embarrass party, province Advertisement Advertise With Us\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later",

His production was proof that he has the ability to unlock defenses in tight matches with everything on the line.”\nWathuta, 20, joins the Rapids organization after spending the past two seasons at the University of Vermont. The forward excelled with the program that won the NCAA D1 National Championship this past season after their 2-1 victory over Marshall University on December 16.\nOver his two seasons with the Catamounts, he made 39 appearances with 34 starts, having logged 2,883 total minutes. Wathuta recorded three goals and fifteen assists, with his most successful season coming this past year in 2024. The forward netted three goals and supplied 14 assists, which set a new Vermont single-season record and ranked second in NCAA Division 1.\nThe Calgary-native racked up awards over the course of his collegiate career, with his 2024 campaign earning him major recognition. In addition to being a National Champion, Wathuta was recognized as an America East All-Conference 1st team member and was also named the America East Midfielder of the Year.\nTRANSACTION: Colorado Rapids 2 sign forward Sydney Wathuta to an MLS NEXT Pro contract on January 16, 2025.\nSydney Wathuta\nPosition: Forward\nPronunciation: SID-nee WAH-too-tah\nHeight: 6-2\nWeight: 180\nBirthdate: June 11, 2004\nBirthplace: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\nNationality: Canadian",
