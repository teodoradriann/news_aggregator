    "text": "Tech Musk asks ‘high-IQ revolutionaries’ to work without pay on Trump’s new project written by Elijah November 14, 2024 0 comments Share 0 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Tumblr Reddit 37 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are asking Americans who are “high-IQ small-government revolutionaries” and willing to work more than 80 hours a week to join their new Department of Government Efficiency, without pay.\nIn a new X post on Thursday that served as a job ad and another of Musk’s trolling attempts, the newly formed Doge account wrote: “We don’t need any more part-time idea generators. “We need small-government revolutionaries with super-high IQs and willing to work 80+ hours a week to cut costs in unglamorous ways.”\nThe name of the department, which is not part of the federal government, is reminiscent of the meme of an expressive shiba inu dog.\n“If this is you, send a private message to this account with your CV. “Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants,” the statement added.\nIn a separate post, Musk weighed in on the claim, saying, “In fact, this will be a tedious job, will make a lot of enemies, and the compensation will be zero.”\n“What a great deal!” Musk, the richest man in the world, wrote with a laughing emoji. He promised to reduce federal bureaucracy by a third and cut $2 trillion from U.S. government spending, a move he said “necessarily involves some temporary difficulties.”\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump announced the appointment of Musk and Ramaswamy to Doge, saying: “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, eliminate excess regulations, reduce unnecessary spending and restructure federal agencies. essential to the ‘Save America’ movement.”\nTrump went on to describe the newly formed department as the “’Manhattan Project’ of our time,” referring to the U.S.-led research program during World War II that sought to create the nuclear bomb that killed a My dear 214,000 people in Japan in 1945.\nSince the first assassination attempt against Trump in July, Musk has become one of his staunchest allies, at one point proclaiming himself the “Dark Magician” during the campaign. He donated $120 million to the president-elect’s campaign, held rallies for him in the swing state of Pennsylvania, and tirelessly promoted Trump’s message on X.\nskip past newsletter promotion A weekly dive into how technology is shaping our lives\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online advertisements and content funded by third parties.

Musk entered the company headquarters with a sink. According According to a new estimate from Fidelity, X is worth almost 80% less than when Musk bought it two years ago.",

    "text": "The company producing an early fault detection (EFD) system that helps prevent bushfires and blackouts globally has established a new manufacturing hub in Richmond.\nIND Technology has commercialised this innovation from RMIT University and installed it across the United States and Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia and Australia.\nThe EFD technology acts like a smoke alarm for the power network, covering up to five kilometres of powerlines with two devices that listen to radio frequency signals travelling up and down power lines.\nSome of these radio frequency signals are generated by failing assets on the powerlines. The EFD system uses the radio frequency information collected by the sensors to work out where and which equipment is failing. With the EFD system, network owners can monitor every network asset 24/7, including during extreme weather when asset failures are likely to first appear.\nProfessor Alan Wong, who invented the EFD system at RMIT, is the founder and CEO of IND Technology.\nHe said the new facility would generate millions of dollars of export income for Victoria and Australia. The EFD system comprises parts made almost entirely in Melbourne.\n\"We are strengthening Australia's advanced manufacturing sector, creating high-tech local jobs and showcasing homegrown innovation,\" Wong said.\n\"Our EFD systems have already prevented more than 500 potential fires, primarily in North America where it has been widely adopted.\n\"The demand for our product in North America has fuelled the expansion of our manufacturing facility in Melbourne. The facility will allow us to produce more than 10,000 EFD devices each year to meet the growth.\"\nWith this new hub, IND Technology is seeking to work closely with regulators and governments to ensure the EFD system also gets rolled out across Victoria and the rest of Australia.\nIn November last year, the company submitted a report to the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action on the FireSafe Early Fault Detection trial.\n\"Our trial tested this bushfire safety technology across rural Victoria,\" Wong said.\n\"A lot of Victoria's worst bushfires, like the ones on Black Saturday, were caused by faults in these old powerlines.\n\"These powerlines are still being used to power remote areas today, and the risk is still very real.\"\nDistinguished Professor Calum Drummond AO, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Innovation and Vice-President at RMIT University, said IND Technology's trajectory exemplified the university's mission to translate academic research for societal benefit.\n\"IND Technology is on a strong growth trajectory selling 60 devices in 2020 and 4,000 in 2024,\" he said.\n\"Not only has this meant local job and wealth creation, it has also meant lives and property are being saved through the translation and roll-out of this technology born at RMIT.\"",

    "text": "O Ministério da Saúde lançou uma campanha de vacinação dentro de escolas. O objetivo é reforçar e ampliar as coberturas vacinais entre crianças e adolescentes. Sarampo, gripe, poliomielite, febre amarela e dengue são alguns dos alvos da ação. Em outra importante medida, o ministério alterou o esquema de imunização contra o HPV, que agora passa a ser em dose única. A vacinação no ambiente escolar será eficiente para aumentar adesão? Tratando-se de imunização, como a escola pode ser referência no cuidado com as crianças e adolescentes? Quais outras estratégias podem ser utilizadas para ampliar a cobertura vacinal? Celso Freitas e a repórter Lívia Veiga conversam com a médica pediátrica e diretora da Sociedade Brasileira de Imunizações (SBIm), Flávia Bravo.
