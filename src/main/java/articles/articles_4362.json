    "text": "[How significant is China as a maritime power?](https://english.cctv.cn/2024/07/11/VIDE1GGMjocyV38llRJWr3RA240711.shtml) Chinese President Xi Jinping holds a welcome ceremony for Umaro Sissoco Embalo, president of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, who is on a state visit to China, at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People prior to their talks in Beijing, capital of China, July 10, 2024. (Xinhua/Ding Haitao) \"This is a good story in the history of exchanges between our two countries and a witness to the profound friendship between our two peoples,\" Xi said. BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- In the square outside the east entrance of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping held an official welcome ceremony for President Umaro Sissoco Embalo of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday, featuring a unique touch: the playing of Guinea-Bissau's national anthem, \"This Is Our Well Beloved Motherland.\" The anthem, written by Guinea-Bissau's founding father Amilcar Lopes Cabral, has a surprising composer -- Chinese musician Xiao He. In the later official meeting between the two presidents, Xi talked with a smile about this intriguing detail. \"China and Guinea-Bissau have a special history of friendship,\" he said. \"The national anthem of Guinea-Bissau 'This Is Our Well Beloved Motherland,' which was played at the welcome ceremony just now, was written by Amilcar Lopes Cabral, the founding father of Guinea-Bissau, and composed by Chinese musician Xiao He.\" \"This is a good story in the history of exchanges between our two countries and a witness to the profound friendship between our two peoples,\" he said. In response, Embalo, wearing a red tie with a dark suit, said: \"President Xi mentioned our national anthem just now, which we sing every day. It was written by our founding father and composed by a Chinese friend. This is something we will never forget.\" He also highlighted China's support before and after the founding of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, saying the two peoples have always stood together. This photo taken on July 7, 2024 shows a square with a statue of Amilcar Lopes Cabral, the founding father of Guinea-Bissau in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. (Xinhua/Han Xu) The history of the national anthem traces back to 1963, when a delegation from then Portuguese Guinea visited China and heard a piece of music by Xiao He. Cabral, a delegate and independence leader of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, then asked Xiao to compose a piece that would inspire his people in their fight for independence. Xiao gladly agreed. Drawing inspiration from African music and set to a 1963 poem by Cabral, Xiao composed a song which later became the national anthem of the western African country. Powerful and heroic in melody, the song fully demonstrates the steel will of the people of Guinea-Bissau in their pursuit of independence. The piece was later adopted by Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde as the national anthem upon their independence from Portugal in 1974. \"It remains Guinea-Bissau's national anthem to this very day,\" said Guinea-Bissau's ambassador to China Antonio Serifo Embalo. \"It's a story that testifies to the enduring friendship between Guinea-Bissau and China.\" The long-standing friendship between China and Guinea-Bissau is also evident in their practical cooperation across various fields. Over the years, China has provided substantial support to Guinea-Bissau in areas such as infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, and education. \"China truly understands the needs of African countries and is a good partner for them,\" said Diamantino Lopes, a sociologist and professor at Lusofona University of Guinea-Bissau. The longstanding half-century traditional friendship has laid a solid foundation for mutually beneficial cooperation today, and China's support in developing talents in education, health, and agriculture is crucial for Guinea-Bissau's development, he said.",

    "text": "La primera campaña de inmunización contra el Virus Sincitial Respiratorio (VRS), que se puso en marcha en octubre con el medicamento nirsevimab para proteger a los menores de un año de complicaciones como la bronquiolitis o la neumonía, ha evitado desde entonces casi 10.000 hospitalizaciones de bebés. Así lo pone de manifiesto la evaluación que ha realizado el Ministerio de Sanidad junto con las comunidades y el Centro Nacional de Epidemiología del Instituto de Salud Carlos III sobre la efectividad y el impacto de nirsevimab para prevenir la enfermedad grave -no la infección, puesto que no es esterilizante-. Con coberturas que han rebasado en algunas comunidades el 90 %, los resultados desvelan que la inmunización con el anticuerpo monoclonal nirsevimab, que España ha sido el primer país en aplicar de forma masiva, redujo el riesgo de hospitalización en un 83 % en los menores de 6 meses inmunizados. Los ingresos de los bebés de hasta 1 año de edad han caído un 75 % respecto a los que se estimaba que se iban a producir en este grupo, lo que se traduce en cerca de 10.000 hospitalizaciones evitadas. El VRS es la principal causa de infecciones en las vías respiratorias inferiores en la población infantil menor de un año, especialmente las relacionadas con bronquiolitis y neumonía; en España, las infecciones causadas por este virus provocan todos los inviernos una importante sobrecarga asistencial, tanto en atención primaria, como en urgencias y hospitales. Nirsevimab empezó a darse en octubre del año pasado a menores de 6 meses nacidos a partir del 1 abril de 2023 y hasta el 31 de marzo de este año, así como a bebés de riesgo de hasta 2 años; para la próxima temporada, ya está disponible la vacuna frente a VRS para embarazadas, que ofrecerá protección a los lactantes por el paso de anticuerpos durante el embarazo y que está pendiente de inclusión en el calendario vacunal. Después de un periodo de distorsión provocado por la covid-19, el sincitial, como otros virus, volvió a circular con fuerza en la temporada 2022-2023 hasta recuperar su comportamiento y valores habituales precovid en la sucesiva. De esta forma, su impacto en esta última temporada ha sido menor, según los datos del ISCIII: hasta marzo, el VRS dejó 465.723 infecciones atendidas en Atención Primaria (casi la mitad que las 877.252 de la temporada previa) y 21.190 hospitalizaciones frente a 34.632 ocurridas en 2022-2023. Las máximas tasas de ingresos se produjeron en menores de 1 año (3.329, el 15,7 % del total por VRS) en comparación con las 13.432 (38,8 %) de la temporada anterior.",

    "text": "\\nAutonomous vehicle startup Cruise has admitted to filing a false report to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding an accident where one of its robotaxis dragged a pedestrian in San Francisco.\n\\nAccording to the DOJ, the San Francisco-based company filed false documents to \\u201cimpede, obstruct, or influence the investigation\\u201d of the 2023 crash that involved one of its robotaxis. Cruise has agreed to pay $500,000.\n\\n\\u201cToday\\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement holds Cruise, LLC and its employees accountable for their lack of candor in a federal regulatory compliance action,\\u201d said Cory LeGars, special agent-in-charge of the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General Western Region. \\u201cTogether with our law enforcement and prosecutorial partners, we will engage our collective resources to pursue companies and individuals who intentionally circumvent administration of federal regulations.\\u201d\n\\n\\nIn October 2023, one of Cruise\\u2019s robotaxi ran over a pedestrian in San Francisco. The vehicle did not detect the person was underneath the vehicle and then attempted to pull over, in turn dragging the victim 20 feet. However, the pedestrian had initially been hit by a human-driven car and landed on the path of a Cruise robotaxi.\n\\nPer the DOJ, the General Motors-owned company filed documents with the NHTSA, as federal regulations required, but omitted that the robotaxi dragged the person.\n\\nThe omission of that information rendered the report filed incomplete by NHTSA guidelines.\n\\nThe day after the incident, employees met with NHTSA and provided a video of the incident. According to the DOJ, Cruise did not correct its accident report until 10 days after the incident.\n\\n\\u201cCruise will comply with the requirements set forth in the agreement, as we continue to move forward under new leadership and with a firm commitment to transparency with our regulators,\\u201d said Craig Glidden, president and chief administrative officer at Cruise.\n\\nWhen details of the incident came to light, the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspected the company of having permits to overtake any self-driving vehicles on public roads.\n\\nCurrently, the company has launched small fleets in Arizona and Texas, where vehicles will operate with a human safety driver behind the wheel.\n\\nAccording to Crunchbase data, Cruise has raised over $15 billion from investors such as GM and SoftBank. Since acquiring Cruise in 2016, General Motors has spent and lost upwards of $8 billion. Of that, $3.48 billion was lost in 2023.\n\\n\\u201cFederal laws and regulations are in place to protect public safety on our roads. Companies with self-driving cars that seek to share our roads and crosswalks must be fully truthful in their reports to their regulators,\\u201d said Martha Boersch, chief of the office of the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Criminal Division.\n\\n",
