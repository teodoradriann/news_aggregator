    "text": "Wildfires burn through over 7,500 acres in Virginia during bizarre weather week At least five fires greater than 100 acres began to burn on Wednesday and continued on Thursday across Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. Texas: Huge wildfire engulfs Walker County Dozens of [wildfires](/latest/wild-fires) have erupted along the Appalachian Mountains on Thursday as a cold front across the mid-Atlantic combines with humidity during a bizarre weather week. Wildfires have been reported from [Maryland](/latest/maryland) to [North Carolina](/latest/north-carolina), with the most amount of damage in [West Virginia](/latest/west-virginia) and [Virginia](/latest/virginia). At least five fires greater than 100 acres began to burn on Wednesday and continued on Thursday across Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. State firefighters have responded to over 100 wildfires in the past two days, according to officials with the Virginia Department of Forestry. The fires have appeared to burn through more than 7,500 acres as evacuation orders are issued in specific counties.

Multiple roads and highways in the county have also been temporarily shut down. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a health alert through Thursday night due to danger from heavy smoke. The department said: “Active children and adults should limit or reschedule strenuous outdoor activities until conditions improve. “People unusually sensitive to air pollution, especially those with heart or lung disease (including asthma), should avoid strenuous outdoor activities until conditions improve.” Orange-tinted skies were seen throughout Virginia on Thursday, and at least 10,000 electric outages were reported in the region due to wind gusts of more than 60mph. The National Weather Service office in Washington, DC, and Blacksburg, Virginia, said that the amount of fire activity is not unprecedented compared to wildfires over the past decades. On Friday night into Saturday, heavy rain is expected to soak the region, followed by another few dry days next week.

    "text": "Expressing concerns over increase in the recent monsoon patterns, increasing temperature and extreme weather events in the country, experts from different sectors stressed the need to explore strategies to mitigate the risks of climate change at the session on ‘Why the monsoon has been raining woes over the last few years’ at the businessline Agri and Commodity Summit 2025 titled ‘Shaping agriculture and agri-business in a changing climate’ in New Delhi on Friday.\nReferring to 2024 being the warmest year, DS Pai, Scientist G, IMD, said no significant rainfall trend can be seen over the country in the last 125 years. Despite not showing any important trend, extreme rainfall events are increasing, particularly over the central part of India and along the West Coast and Northeast.\nThe North-East, which gets maximum rainfall, is showing a decreasing trend. Since the region is getting a lot of rain, this is not affecting. Interestingly, Northwest India, including Rajasthan, is witnessing increasing trend of rainfall.\nAlso read: From droughts to floods: How India is building climate-resilient agriculture Max and min temps up He said long time series of temperature from 1901-2024 shows that both maximum and minimum temperatures are showing significant trend. Now, both maximum as well as minimum temperature have seen a significant increase. Pai said all these aspects have got a significant impact on the agriculture.\nStating that there have been record levels of greenhouse gases just after Covid, he said development activities and a lot of deforestation are causing this. Deforestation is becoming a feedback kind of thing whereby there are more and more greenhouse gases.\nStating that climate change is real, Ajai Rana, Chairman, FSII and CEO, Savannah Seeds, said carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere has gone up significantly over the years and so is methane emission. Apart from industries, agriculture is also responsible for this increase in green house gas emissions.\nGiving the example of rice crop, he said the use of chemical fertilizers, especially urea, leads to release of nitrous oxide. They absorb more heat in the climate leading to increase in temperature. The oceans are becoming warmer and that is leading to the change in monsoon patterns.\nOn the impact of changes in rainfall patterns, he said the late rains at the time of flowering and seed setting lead to more diseases and insects and lead to drop in productivity.\nAlso read: Govt to revitalise cooperative sector to combat climate change Short-period rainfall Nabansu Chattopadhyay, Director, Agricultural Meteorology Division, WMO, said the district level data show Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and eastern parts of UP witnessing lower rainfall over the years.\nStating that signal is clear, he said if we are not taking these as a benchmark now, then it will be not very supportive for the agriculture\nProjections are also mentioning that there will be 4-16 per cent of increase in rainfall. The most important part is that this rainfall is very short period rainfall. This will impact agriculture production, Chattopadhyay said.\nSpeaking at the session, Neha Kumar, Head, South Asia Programme, Climate Bonds Initiative, said RBI had recently asked 15 banks to conduct an exercise on food risk to see how much of their assets are actually exposed to that. Agriculture lending forms part of priority sector lending and all banks have exposure to agriculture lending. Climate element of agriculture is still not factored into either the practices that need to be followed for farming or the lending or the investment practices.\nFundamental shift in tackling She emphasized the need for science, policy, economics and finance to come together for robust agricultural productivity of the country.\nShe said that more and more banks are hiring climate scientists. “There is going to be a fundamental shift in how you will tackle climate change, especially from the agri point of view,” she said.\nTouching upon inflation, she said food inflation was in the region of 2.9 or something until 2020. After that it has doubled. The usual demand supply production consumption metrics to determine price are no longer following a predictable pattern, climate change has become an endemic source of disruption, and that is also causing sort of persistent food inflation, she said.\nSubramani Ra Mancombu of businessline moderated the session.\nThe businessline Agri and Commodity Summit 2025 is presented by Nabard and co-powered by Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSSI) in association with Yara.\nThe Associate Partners are NCDEX, Indofil, Bayer, Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Ltd, Kribhco Agri, NSE, Aqua Group and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

    "text": "According to WISPAP nation’s internet speed has nosedived by a staggering 30-40 per cent By Editorial Board August 16, 2024\nA representational image showing a person using a mobile phone. — AFP/File Welcome to Pakistan, where internet ‘speed’ has become the latest oxymoron. If you’re finding yourself stuck in an endless buffering loop, fret not; you’re not alone. According to the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), the nation’s internet speed has nosedived by a staggering 30-40 per cent. That’s not just a speed bump; it’s a full-on roadblock. If the internet were any slower, we’d be using carrier pigeons. The root of this digital debacle seems to be increased security and surveillance measures. Imagine a firewall so comprehensive it turns the internet into a digital sloth. WISPAP has linked the speed issues to increased security and surveillance whose aftermath might result in severe economic consequences as well. By many accounts, the government’s alleged ‘trial run’ of this firewall has morphed into a nightmare for e-commerce and online businesses whose very survival could be at stake. Meanwhile, the nation’s WhatsApp users are suffering from painfully slow uploads and downloads.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) have remained quiet as millions across the country continue to face trouble accessing internet services due to limited connectivity, particularly while using mobile data in some regions. Not only that, government ministers have not only acknowledged that a firewall trial is going on in the country but also defended it as a cyber security measure that every government in the world takes. This is a claim that has been debunked by digital rights experts in Pakistan who say that firewalls are essentially a form of pre-censorship that should have no place in any democracy.\nIn this day and age, it is amazing to see the government talking about web management systems and firewalls. When a government – a democratically elected one – starts to justify censorship, that should be a cause of concern for the country’s citizens because it essentially means the government does not believe in freedom of speech and expression. This is 2024 – the internet is not some novelty luxury but a fundamental need. It seems though that the state would rather have us sitting in caves around bonfires, what with a slow WhatsApp, a ban on X (formerly Twitter), and even blackouts at times. In a democracy, the internet is not disrupted. In a democracy, freedom of expression is guaranteed with limitations on incitement to violence and hate speech. However, while we do not take any action against hate speech or incitement to violence, we are quick to ban social media platforms and slow down the internet because the state does not have any counter-narrative to fake news or propaganda. So what exactly is the government’s big plan to save ‘Digital Pakistan’? A start could be to stop treating the internet like a nuisance and start seeing it as a vital economic artery. If Pakistan continues down this path of digital doom, it might find itself more isolated than a dial-up user in a fiber-optic world.\nPlaying with death Last year, around two people were killed and 85 injured in celebratory firing incidents on 14th August\nIndia’s radioactive riddle Statement comes days after police in Bihar arrested three smugglers with 50 grams of radioactive californium\nWe the youth Over two-thirds of all Pakistanis around today are under the age of 30\nBlueprint for tolerance Forced conversions, lynchings and targeted killings of their communities are alarmingly common occurrences\nOpen internet Government is installing firewall to filter out content before it gets on internet – Pakistani internet, that is\nAccountability takes a new turn Former ISI chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed was taken into custody by the army\nUN Rights Expert Demands Sanction On Israel Over Settler Attacks On Palestinians Jennifer Garner Fills In For Jennifer Lopez On Ben Affleck's 52nd Birthday Usher Postpones More 'Past Present Future Tour' Shows On Doctors' Orders Taylor Swift Switches Song Name To Seemingly Diss Kanye West Kim Kardashian Still Has 'PTSD' From Being Booed At Tom Brady's Roast ‘Rust’ Director Joel Souza Wanted To ‘die’ After Shooting Incident Blake Lively Slammed For ‘cruel’ Answer To ‘genuine Question’ Doctors Charged In Plot To Scam Matthew Perry With Overpriced Ketamine",

Debido a las lluvias de las últimas horas y trabajo de brigadistas, se extinguieron los últimos tres incendios forestales en el estado de Puebla, luego de una intensa ola de calor sufrida.

Las regiones más afectadas serían las Sierras Norte, Nororiental y Negra, así como Valle Serdán, mientras que el resto del estado espera lluvias de 25 a 40 milímetros. ¿Qué hacer ante las intensas lluvias? La temporada de lluvias puede traer consigo una serie de desafíos para la población en general, sin embargo es posible minimizar sus efectos negativos. La prevención de afectaciones por lluvias comienza con la preparación del hogar, es fundamental revisar y mantener el techo en buen estado, asegurándose de que no haya tejas sueltas o dañadas que puedan permitir filtraciones. Además, es importante limpiar regularmente las canaletas y desagües para evitar obstrucciones que puedan causar inundaciones. Sellar grietas en paredes y ventanas es otra medida esencial para prevenir la entrada de agua. Considerar la instalación de protectores contra inundaciones, como barreras y sistemas de drenaje, en áreas propensas a inundarse puede hacer una gran diferencia. Asimismo, equiparse con suministros de emergencia es crucial, un botiquín de primeros auxilios, suficiente agua potable y alimentos no perecederos para al menos 72 horas, linternas con baterías de repuesto y un radio a pilas son elementos básicos que no deben faltar. Diseñar un plan de emergencia que incluya rutas de evacuación y puntos de reunión puede salvar vidas. Guardar documentos importantes en bolsas impermeables o en una caja fuerte a prueba de agua es otra medida preventiva clave. Además, revisar la póliza de seguro para asegurarse de que cubra daños por inundaciones es fundamental. Durante las lluvias, es crucial evitar zonas inundadas y no intentar cruzar calles anegadas, ya que pueden ser peligrosas. Desconectar aparatos eléctricos en caso de riesgo de inundación y seguir las recomendaciones de las autoridades son medidas adicionales que ayudan a proteger a la familia y el hogar. Con estas precauciones, es posible enfrentar la temporada de lluvias con mayor seguridad y tranquilidad. LA/TJM",

    "text": "Analysts have foreseen better crude palm oil (CPO) prices in 2024, as El Nino weather is expected to affect palm oil supply.\nRHB Investment Bank, the largest investment bank by asset size in Malaysia, said in its recent report that it expects CPO prices to trade higher – crossing the 4,000 ringgit (872 U.S. dollars) per ton mark – as supply should be somewhat affected by El Nino as well as the impact of lower fertilization activities in 2021 to 2022.\nUOBKayHian, one of Asia’s largest brokerage firms headquartered in Singapore, also expects CPO prices to trade higher in 2024 with an average price of 4,200 ringgit per ton, following the average of 3,850 ringgit per ton recorded year to date in 2023.\nThe higher price expectation is also underpinned by potentially lower palm oil production, a challenging outlook for global vegetable oil supply and higher palm oil demand.\nAffin Hwang Investment Bank, one of Malaysia’s leading bank-backed investment banking groups, also expects CPO prices to trend higher in 2024, attributable to the El Nino phenomenon that is expected to have an impact on the global supply of edible oils and their prices.\nThe research house’s CPO price assumption for 2024 is 4,200 ringgit to 4,400 ringgit per ton.\nAffin Hwang also expects Malaysia’s plantation sector earnings to jump 24 percent year-on-year in 2024 from a low base in 2023 due mainly to higher CPO price expectations while Malaysia production could be flattish year-on-year.
