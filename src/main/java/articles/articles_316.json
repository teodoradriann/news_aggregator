    "text": "Department of Transportation skipped multiple steps in Kensington Expressway Project The Kensington Expressway also known as the “33” is an admitted, massive, racial injustice mistake from nearly 70 years ago that has torn a hole right through the east side of Buffalo. The expressway is a key part in shaping the current economic and environmental disaster surrounding the East part of the city. The once beautiful Humboldt Parkway green space was completely torn away and replaced with a 6-lane highway, robbing East Side residents — predominantly residents of color — of greenspace. State and local politicians have acknowledged that and have agreed with the residents that the restoration of Humboldt Parkway needs to happen sooner rather than later. Plans were underway for the state to do just that with construction contracts being planned to be handed out sometime this month. However, the state threw the community for a loop as they instead opted to restore the parkway but keep the concept of a highspeed expressway. Plans to build a tunnel under the parkway were developed and confirmed resulting in multiple lawsuits from Eastside Parkway Coalition (ESP). ESP is an organization committed to the full restoration of Humboldt Parkway. They claim the State’s attempt to keep this highway would cause mass environmental harm and they have skipped multiple legal steps in ensuring the project was environmentally safe. ESP’s attorney Alan Bozer stated that the state failed to do an Environmental Impact Statement. WBFO has confirmed that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has not filed an Environmental Impact Statement and instead opted to do a 325-page Environmental Assessment. However, flaws were found in that report as the assessment does not cover any construction years, just the year of project completion 2027, and 20 years after completion 2047. The Department of Environmental Conservation released an air quality study showing a significant drop in air quality along the Kensington Expressway starting at Grider Street and going through Humboldt Parkway and downtown. The drop in air quality included many elevated focus spots for nitrogen dioxide and black carbon. Despite this information against the construction of the tunnel, state and local officials have ignored the calls to stop construction, instead doubling down. The Governor’s office reiterated their previous statement: “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to correct one of the most damaging planning injustices of the 20th Century, and we look forward to reconnecting this community soon.” The City of Buffalo's Acting Mayor Christopher Scanlon threw his support behind the state’s decision. “I think we have to be careful at times that thinking that what we hear from residents may be the majority of residents,\" said Scanlon. \"So at this point, I’m ok with us moving forward with the project.” Opening arguments will be heard in court on Friday, October 25, at 2 PM.",

L’animateur, qui s’est confié sur son combat contre la maladie, a été l’invité des Grandes Gueules ce jeudi 25 avril 2024 sur RMC et RMC Story.\nDepuis le plateau de l’émission où Charles Consigny a réglé ses comptes avec Bertrand Chameroy, il a été interrogé sur un message qu’il a posté sur X le mercredi 24 avril. “Retour d’Equateur, comité d’accueil à Roissy par des baltringues et des traînes-savates – faux taxis sans doute – qui me traitent d’islamophobe et de raciste. Un policier alerté ne peut rien faire bien-sûr. La prochaine, ce sera le coup de couteau ? Bienvenue en France !”, a-t-il écrit sur le réseau social autrefois appelé Twitter.\n“ Je suis souvent agressé… ” : Bernard de la Villardière pris à partie par des faux taxis à Roissy\nOlivier Truchot lui a demandé ce qu’il s’était précisément passé. “Il s’est passé ce qui se passe pour moi depuis quelques années. Chaque fois que j’arrive dans ce pays – je rentre chez moi après des voyages à l’autre bout du monde -, je suis souvent agressé à Roissy de manière verbale par des gens qui sont là, des faux taxis souvent. On se demande d’ailleurs ce qu’attend la société Roissy-Charles de Gaulle pour faire un peu le ménage…”, a répondu le présentateur de M6.\n“Il y a une police anti-faux taxis, mais ils ne sont pas assez nombreux. Ils ne sont que quelques dizaines, d’ailleurs les vrais taxis s’en plaignent régulièrement… Et voilà je passe : ‘Ah oui La Villardière, islamophobe, raciste…’ Avant c’était quand je faisais 100 mètres, je les entendais vaguement derrière moi, et aujourd’hui, ils viennent face à moi pour m’insulter… Je ne l’admets pas ! J’ai l’impression que je prends plus de risques en France que dans d’autres pays où je vais depuis des années…”, a poursuivi l’animateur qui a fait de tristes révélations sur son état de santé.\nDes incidents sur le tournage d’ Enquête exclusive\nBernard de la Villardière a ensuite relaté avoir été la cible de menaces lors de tournages pour Enquête exclusive. “Deux fois, j’ai dû interrompre le tournage parce qu’il y a des gens qui sont venus vers moi en me disant : ‘Monsieur de la Villardière, allez-vous en parce qu’au sinon on va vous égorger…’ Ça s’est passé à Saint-Brieuc, sur les quais de Saône à Lyon l’année dernière, et c’est un vrai scandale !”, a-t-il déploré.\n“Pourquoi on vous traite d’islamophobe et raciste ?”, lui a alors demandé Olivier Truchot. “Je ne sais pas de quelle idéologie ça procède, mais en tout cas, je pense que c’est une volonté en France de conquérir le territoire, d’intimider tous ceux dont on estime qu’ils sont islamophobes parce qu’ils critiquent des régimes islamistes. Parce que je vais en Afghanistan, en Irak, que j’ai dénoncé les actions de Daesh en France et à l’étranger…”, a estimé Bernard de la Villardière.",

    "text": "Dos goles en la prórroga del montenegrino Stevan Jovetic y el marroquí Youssef El-Arabi en la prórroga permitieron al Olympiacos, que dirige el vasco José Luis Mendilibar, sellar su pase a los cuartos de final de la Conference League, tras remontar los tres goles de desventaja (1-4) con los que cerró el choque de ida, al golear este jueves por 1-6 al Maccabi Tel Aviv. Pero si Jovetic, exjugador del Sevilla, y El Arabi, que militó cuatro temporadas en el Granada, fueron los encargados de culminar la remontada griega en el tiempo extra, el triunfo de los de Mendilibar no puede entenderse sin la sobresaliente actuación de Daniel Podence. El atacante portugués lideró la victoria de un Olympiacos que en poco o nada se pareció al del encuentro de ida, en el que los de Pireo perdían por un claro un claro 1-3 apenas cumplida la primera media hora de juego. Todo lo contrario de lo ocurrido este jueves en la ciudad serbia de Backa Topola, donde juega sus partidos europeos el conjunto israelí a causa del conflicto de Gaza, donde el equipo heleno apenas tardó diez minutos en dejar claro que iba a por la remontada. El tiempo que tardó en entrar en acción Podence, que anotó el 0-1 en una acción en la que el atacante luso logro generarse el espacio suficiente en el interior del área para batir (0-1) con un ajustado disparo al portero israelí Roi Mishpati. Pero Daniel Podence no sólo posee gol, sino también la visión de juego y la precisión en el golpeo para asistir a sus compañeros, como dejó claro con los dos sensacionales pases que permitieron a Konstantinos Fortounis y al marroquí Ayoub El Kaabi igualar la contienda (0-3) antes de llegar al descanso. Todo un varapalo para el Maccabi Tel Aviv, que tras lo ocurrido en la ida se veía ya en unos cuartos de final, que los del irlandés Robbie Keane parecieron a volver a tener en sus manos tras recortar distancias (1-3) con un gol de penalti de Eran Zahavi a los 57 minutos. Sin embargo, ni el Olympiacos, ni mucho menos El Kaabi estaban dispuestos a que nada, ni nadie les apartara de la siguiente ronda de la Conference League como demostró el atacante marroquía los 65 minutos con un espectacular gol (1-4) de chilena que llevó la eliminatoria a la prórroga. Tiempo extra en el que el conjunto heleno traslado su superioridad al marcador con los goles de Jovetic en el minuto 93 y El-Arabi, que diez minutos más tarde firmó el definitivo 1-6 para los de Mendilibar, que tras llevar el pasado año al Sevilla a la conquista de la Europa League quiere conquistar este curso con el Olympiacos la Conference.",

    "text": "Today, we're diving into the surprisingly medicinal history of a household favorite – and no, it's not what you're thinking!\nPicture this: the year is 1834. Medicine is not as advanced as it is today, and people are always on the lookout for new remedies. Enter a popular condiment, which, believe it or not, was once considered a medicinal miracle for indigestion. Yes, we're talking about ketchup!\nBack in the 1830s, ketchup wasn't just the perfect companion for fries and burgers. It was actually prescribed and sold as a treatment for digestive woes. Hard to imagine, right? But it's true! This common kitchen staple was believed to have healing properties and was recommended by some doctors to their patients suffering from indigestion.\nSo, how did this transformation happen? The journey from medicine cabinet to dining table is as intriguing as it is amusing. Initially made with ingredients like tomatoes, spices, and vinegar, ketchup was thought to aid digestion – a theory that, while not entirely accurate by modern standards, was quite popular at the time.\nAs time went on and medical science advanced, ketchup gradually lost its medicinal status. Instead, it found a permanent spot in our kitchens and hearts as the beloved condiment we know today. It's fascinating how the perception and use of everyday items can change so drastically over time.\nSo next time you're enjoying your favorite ketchup-slathered dish, take a moment to appreciate its quirky and unexpected past. Who knew that a simple bottle of ketchup had such an interesting story?\nStay tuned for more surprising facts and stories in our \"Did You Know?\" series. Stay curious.\n-Bo",

    "title": "In Nigeria and much of Africa, Catholic same-sex couples see no blessings soon | The Straits Times",
    "text": "ABUJA - Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican's declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent's most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican's declaration will change much.\n\"Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,\" Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope's decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God's children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n\"There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,\" said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n\"I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,\" she said.\n\"We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.\" REUTERS\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

    "text": "La uña de gato es una planta trepadora con importantes propiedades curativas que, sin embargo, está en peligro de extinción. Su nombre científico es Uncaria tomentosa, y crece principalmente en las selvas tropicales del centro y sur de América, especialmente en la región amazónica.\nDebe su nombre popular a las espinas curvas que emergen de sus tallos, parecidas a las garras de los felinos. Se trata de una planta de tallo leñoso y flexible que puede alcanzar hasta 30 metros de largo, con hojas ovaladas y aterciopeladas, flores tubulares blancas o amarillas, y frutos en forma de baya rojiza o anaranjada.\nPropiedades medicinales de la uña de gato\nDesde la época prehispánica, las culturas indígenas amazónicas ya utilizaban esta planta por sus efectos medicinales. En la actualidad, distintos estudios científicos respaldan sus beneficios, entre ellos:\n- Antiinflamatorias: alivia dolor, inflamación y enrojecimiento.\n- Inmunomoduladoras: refuerza la respuesta inmune, útil en tratamientos contra el cáncer.\n- Antineoplásicas: contribuye a prevenir la formación de tumores.\n- Antioxidantes: combate el envejecimiento celular y algunos tipos de cáncer.\nEl Instituto Nacional del Cáncer (NCI) de EE.UU. incluso señala que el extracto de uña de gato “puede inhibir la proliferación de ciertos tipos de células cancerosas”.\nAdemás, fortalece el sistema inmunológico y es útil para tratar trastornos gastrointestinales como gastritis, úlceras y la enfermedad de Crohn. También se investiga su potencial antiviral y antibacteriano.\nMirá También: El yuyo que hay que ponerle al mate para desintoxicar el hígado después de grandes comidas\nCómo se consume este yuyo\nExisten varias formas de consumir uña de gato para aprovechar sus propiedades:\n- Infusión o té: se prepara con una cucharadita de la raíz o corteza seca en agua caliente, dejando reposar 10 a 15 minutos. Puede tomarse hasta tres veces al día.\n- Suplementos: disponibles en cápsulas, tabletas o extractos líquidos en tiendas naturales. Se recomienda seguir las dosis indicadas y consultar al médico.\n- Extracto líquido: se puede diluir en agua u otros líquidos siguiendo las indicaciones del envase.\nPrecauciones y contraindicaciones\nA pesar de sus múltiples beneficios, la uña de gato puede tener efectos adversos si no se usa correctamente:\n- Embarazo y lactancia: no se recomienda por falta de estudios suficientes.\n- Enfermedades autoinmunes: puede agravar condiciones como lupus o artritis reumatoide.\n- Pacientes trasplantados o con medicamentos inmunosupresores: podría interferir en los tratamientos.\n- Alergias: puede causar reacciones como picazón, erupciones o dificultad para respirar.\n- Interacciones con medicamentos: especialmente anticoagulantes, inmunosupresores o fármacos para la presión arterial.\nPor eso, siempre es fundamental consultar con un profesional de la salud antes de comenzar a consumir cualquier planta medicinal, incluso si es de origen natural.",
