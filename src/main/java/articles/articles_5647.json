    "text": "( MENAFN - AsiaNet News) Ahead of the inauguration of revered Ram Temple in Ayodhya, vibrant offerings from across India is set to embellish the sacred grounds. Among these extraordinary tributes are a towering 108-foot incense stick, a majestic gold bow and arrow, and an impressive 2,100kg bell crafted from a fusion of eight metals, all destined for the temple precincts.\nAdding a touch of floral finesse to this grandeur, a Gujarat-based florist, Ashok Bansali, is orchestrating a distinct floral adornment for the temple complex. These flowers, intricately designed with Ram Lalla's name and the invocation \"Jai Shri Ram,\" will be delicately positioned near the deity's idol.\nJD(U) national executive meeting commences amid denial of leadership alterations; check details\nBansali's innovative journey involves four years of dedicated effort to develop technology that prints words and images onto delicate flower petals. With pride, he displays a collection of pink roses bearing the images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, alongside inscriptions such as \"Ram Lalla\" and \"Atmanirbhar Bharat.\"\nDriven by the ethos of the 'Make in India' initiative, Bansali handprinted each petal, investing considerable time in the process. His visionary approach extends beyond flowers; he plans to imprint similar images on indoor plant leaves designated for the temple complex.\nDuring the groundbreaking ceremony in 2020, Bansali presented 500 floral creations. This time, with a larger vision, he aspires to produce between 3,000 to 4,000 adorned flowers for the veneration of Lord Ram.\n'Barcodes for change': Congress unveils innovative crowdfunding strategy at 'Hain Taiyyar Hum' rally in Nagpur\nPreparations are in full swing for the seven-day mega ceremony, commencing on January 16. Artisans from diverse corners of India are diligently crafting floral masterpieces at Ram Katha Park. These designs draw inspiration from the revered Lord Ram, his iconic bow and arrow, Lord Hanuman, and sacred tilak motifs.\nThe auspicious ceremony on January 22 will witness the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, marking a historic milestone in this much-anticipated event. His address to devotees at the temple's main entrance will encapsulate the sanctity and grandeur of this significant occasion.\nMENAFN29122023007385015968ID1107667618\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

Between March 31 and April 3, the two exchanged messages in which Diiorio allegedly offered him money to kill her ex-boyfriend and his daughter.\nOnce the man informed police of the alleged plot, investigators interviewed the Philadelphia officer who was reportedly the intended target. He confirmed Diiorio was his ex-girlfriend and that the two had ended their relationship on March 6.\nThe Philly officer told investigators that his home was “vandalized by a Molotov cocktail in September 22.” Diiorio had also filed a temporary restraining order against him during the summer of 2024, but it was later dropped.\nDiiorio and the man from Tinder then met on April 4 in Gloucester Township, where she provided the man with $500 in cash upfront in exchange for the killings, according to court documents.\nADVERTISEMENT Once the money was exchanged, Diiorio was taken into custody by Gloucester Township Police.\nDiiorio was placed into custody at the Camden County Correctional Facility. It was not immediately clear if she had posted bail.\nA detention hearing is set to occur on Wednesday.",

    "text": "Police successfully rescued four individuals, including two police officers, who were being transferred by the bandits from one location to another during a retaliatory operation in Shah Belo, Kacha. Inspector General Sikander Hamid Khoso stated, “We will not retreat; we will restore peace.” He spoke to the media after the funeral prayers of the martyred officers. DIG said that wherever there is conflict or war, there will be losses. “We won’t spear their facilitators,” he added. Two missing police officers were recovered, while four civilians abducted on Wednesday were also rescued after a clash with the bandits. Recall that on the previous day, armed bandits had attacked a police check post in Ghotki, resulting in an exchange of fire where one bandit was killed and a police officer martyred. Near Sukkur-Multan Motorway, armed men had launched an assault on a police check post. The bandits had abducted a total of eight individuals, including two police officers. After the attack, a fierce exchange of fire ensued between the police officers and the bandits. Among the abducted were Aamir Sarki, Khadim Hussain Sarki, and Babu Phor. The police launched a massive operation to trace the bandits and recover the abductees. Following the incident, relatives of the abductees staged a sit-in on the national highway connecting Sindh, Balochistan, and Punjab, causing traffic jams on both sides of the road. In Jacobabad, bandits had kidnapped three individuals in a single day, bringing the total number of abductions to nine this month.",

    "title": "Looking back, Rodeo Association president calls 2023 Rodeo and Country Fair ‘huge success’ - Surrey Now-Leader",
    "text": "It was a great year in 2023 for the Cloverdale Rodeo, says Kathy Sheppard. During the Association’s annual AGM, Sheppard said the group enjoyed a successful return to Rodeo after three consecutive events were cancelled. (Four years passed without a Rodeo Weekend.) Sheppard, Cloverdale Rodeo & Exhibition Association (CREA) president, called the 2023 Rodeo and Country Fair “a huge success.” At the group’s AGM in the fall of 2023, two new board members were elected. Three director positions were up for election with both Rick Hugh, current 1st vice-president, and Tania Smythe, current 2nd VP, being reelected. Treasurer Michael Cook Jr. did not let his name stand and both Jen Temple and Bonnie Nicholls accepted nominations from the floor. After a tie vote, Cook called for a motion to accept both women as new directors and the motion passed. Several committee reports were submitted and approved. Sheppard submitted her president’s report, which noted the Association’s gratitude toward several volunteers and contractors that helped make Rodeo 2023 a big success. She also recognized the “very strong” relationship between the City of Surrey and CREA as instrumental in contributing to a successful rodeo. Sheppard also submitted a rodeo report. The report thanked the city and city staff “for all the extra work they dedicated to the Stetson Bowl and the facility.” Sheppard said four of five rodeo performances were sold out. Hugh submitted a report on the country fair portion of rodeo weekend. He highlighted successful events from the country fair including: the return of the Indigenous village, wrestling, skateboarding, and the AgriZone rebranded as Farm Friendz. He noted new attractions such as the Brick Corral (a Lego display), Yukon Dan, and Extreme Pogos were also a big hit with fair-goers. Hugh also submitted a report on the Cloverdale Rodeo Youth Initiative Foundation, the scholarship wing of CREA. Scott Wheatley submitted a report on publicity and media. Smythe submitted a membership and volunteer report. City councillor Mike Bose delivered the City of Surrey Report. Bose “acknowledged the amazing work done by the volunteer board of directors, the Association and the volunteers.” He also thanked Farhad Alizedeh and Kelsey Swanson and offered a “special thank you” from the City to the Association. Cook delivered both the HR report and the finance report. As part of the HR report, Cook relayed that the Human Rights Tribunal complaint “has been resolved.” He then read the official statement out loud. (That statement can be found on CREA’s website, cloverdalerodeo.com.) Cook also noted numerous HR policies have been updated. Sheppard also noted updates to the Association’s constitution are “in the final stages of edits” and will be given to members soon. The Association also recognized three people connected to the rodeo that passed away in 2023: former board member [Michael Cook Sr.](https://www.cloverdalereporter.com/obituaries/lifelong-cloverdale-man-gave-his-time-to-help-others-3091397), longtime member and volunteer Wayne Gosche, and rodeo minister Coy Huffman.",
