    "text": "Un ascenseur en panne qui perturbe le quotidien\nLorsqu’elle a emménagé dans la maison en partage La résidence des arènes, le 22 mai 2024, Sonia Petit Sladow était loin de s’imaginer que sa vie quotidienne serait perturbée chaque été par des dysfonctionnements à répétition de l’ascenseur.\nLabellisée Habitat senior services, selon Promologis qui gère la résidence, cette maison en partage compte dix-neuf logements, répartis entre un rez-de-chaussée et un étage, desservi par un ascenseur et un escalier. Elle s’adresse à un public de seniors, avec la possibilité d’accueillir également des personnes en situation de handicap, ou à mobilité réduite (PMR).\n\"Ma fille est en fauteuil roulant manuel. La première incohérence est qu’il lui a été attribué un logement au premier étage, mais cela ne semblait pas gênant puisqu’il y avait un ascenseur. Sauf que ce dernier ne résiste pas aux variations climatiques et notamment aux hausses de chaleur, ce qui fait que tous les étés, il se bloque vers 16 heures pour se réactiver vers 20 heures et ce problème est récurrent, quasiment tous les jours\", indique Brigitte Sladow, la maman de Sonia.\n\"Appelant chaque fois que l’appareil dysfonctionne, il m’a été dit que cela ne servait à rien car le problème était connu. Il a même été dit que j’étais pénible d’appeler presque tous les jours. Ma fille a souscrit, pour intégrer la maison en partage, une adhésion à Amaelles pour participer à des activités en salle commune. Du fait de ces pannes d’ascenseur à répétition, elle ne peut pas assister à ces animations quand elle est bloquée au premier étage\", explique-t-elle. Lorsqu’elle revient d’une consultation ou d’un soin, ce sont les ambulanciers qui doivent porter Sonia jusqu’à son appartement, mais pour les sorties familiales, beaucoup ont dû être annulées car les membres de la famille de la jeune femme ne sont pas en mesure de la porter dans l’escalier.\nLes pannes incessantes de cet ascenseur ont été abordées lors d’une réunion, mercredi 25 juin, en présence du maire, Olivier Fabregoul, de l’adjointe déléguée au développement économique et social, Caroline Fort-Lanes, d’une responsable de Promologis, Florence Fonty, et d’une représentante d’Amaelles, la structure qui gère l’animation de la salle commune. À la suite de cette réunion et malgré plusieurs interventions, le problème persiste et continue de perturber la vie de Sonia, au grand dam de ses proches et du maire qui déplore qu’aucune solution n’ait été trouvée et que l’on n’attribue pas les appartements au rez-de-chaussée en priorité aux personnes en situation de handicap.\nCorrespondant Midi Libre : 06 81 56 87 09",

    "text": "Pakistani actor Ahsan Khan is facing backlash online after a video clip from a recent literary event at the UK Houses of Parliament went viral.\nThe event featured prominent Indian artists Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi and was intended to celebrate South Asian literature and culture.\nWhile the gathering focused on cultural exchange and remained peaceful, a short video showing Khan seated beside Azmi and praising both Indian guests has sparked controversy. In his speech, Khan highlighted the power of art and literature in bridging divides across South Asia, calling creativity a tool for building unity beyond borders.\nHowever, the actor’s remarks – and particularly his interaction with Javed Akhtar – drew sharp criticism from some social media users. The backlash stems in part from Akhtar’s earlier comments in 2023, when he accused Pakistan of providing safe haven to individuals involved in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Those statements were strongly criticised by various Pakistani artists and public figures at the time.\nIn light of that history, Khan’s presence at the same event and his praise for the Indian guests reignited tensions online. Comments on social media ranged from disappointment to outright condemnation. One user called the appearance “shameless,” while another said, “Didn’t expect this from Ahsan Khan.” Critics argue that artists attending cross-border events should be mindful of public sentiment, especially during sensitive political climates.\nKhan, known for advocating regional peace and harmony, used his platform at the event to promote dialogue through culture and the arts. He described artistic expression as a way to connect people beyond national boundaries. Despite his intentions, many feel that the optics of the event have overshadowed the message – a reminder of the fine line public figures walk when navigating cross-cultural engagements.",

    "title": "Russia’s New Hypersonic Missile Attack Sends Chilling Warning to NATO",
    "text": "Putin’s New Toy: The “Oreshnik” Missile Strikes in Ukraine Ah, Russia! The land of vodka, ballet, and now… a brand new intermediate-range ballistic missile. Vladimir Putin took to Russian television to unveil his latest toy — the “Oreshnik.” Yes, you heard it right. “Oreshnik” translates to “hazelnut tree.” I suppose you can do a lot with the word ‘nut’ these days! Clearly, Putin is picking up on the importance of nut puns, just as he’s picking up the pace of missile technology!\nThe Strike and Its Message In a move as subtle as a sledgehammer in a bakery, Russia launched this missile at a military-industrial facility in Dnipro, Ukraine. It raced to its target at a speed that could make Usain Bolt envious — ten times the speed of sound! That’s right, folks, while you’re still deciding what to watch on Netflix, this missile has already delivered its message — thanks for playing, and goodbye!\nPutin, in an icy tone that could freeze a borscht soup, proclaimed that modern air defense systems (thanks, America!) can’t intercept his shiny new missile. If that’s not a chilling warning to NATO, I don’t know what is. Imagine opening your mail one day and finding a note that reads “I just bought a missile faster than your car — signed, Your Friendly Neighbor”! The civility is delightful!\nA New Kind of Combat But wait, there’s more! This missile marks the first time intermediate-range ballistic missiles have been used in combat. It’s like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight. Russian military officials say it can carry a heavier payload and, how charming, it could also be fitted with multiple nuclear warheads. Because one nuke just won’t do for a party like this!\nRetaliation or Escalation? Now, backtracking a little — why this dramatic display of “fireworks”? After Ukraine ventured into Russian territory with American-made long-range missiles, Putin decided that vengeance is a dish best served rough. His mantra? “In case of escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond resolutely in a mirror way.” Now, if only he could just mirror a peaceful resolution!\nGrand Claims and Backhanded Compliments In the ongoing tit-for-tat, this missile test from Russia sends a clear signal: “Look what I’ve got!” If anyone had doubts about the new missile’s effectiveness, the Royal United Services Institute’s director of military sciences, Matthew Savill, said it’s “quite hard to defend against” — well, that’s relieving, isn’t it?\nThe missile’s flashy performance might leave you feeling a bit squeamish, especially after video footage showed fiery trails and powerful explosions. Nationwide watch parties must be a real thing in Russia now, eh? But amidst the showmanship, it’s alarming to think of the real consequences on the ground.\nReactions from Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president with a flair for the theatrical, went all-in with his condemnation of the attack. He accused Russia of using Ukraine as a “testing ground.” Well, if you’re looking for a catchphrase, how about “Welcome to the ‘Oreshnik’ trials — no refunds!” That would go great printed on the side of a missile!\nConclusion At the end of the day, one has to wonder: What’s next? A duel of missiles? Maybe a firing range face-off? If the geopolitical chess game continues this way, it might just come down to a high-stakes game of rock-paper-scissors, where the losers face reclassification as nut-puns!\nSo, folks, keep your calendars clear and your eyes peeled! It’s going to be a bumpy ride. And remember, next time you hear about “Oreshnik,” more than just hazelnuts are involved!\nThis presentation mixes a sharp observational tone with whimsical humor to keep the reader engaged while addressing the serious issues raised in the article.\nThe latest ballistic missile used by Russia has struck a significant military-industrial facility in the heart of Dnipro, Ukraine, signaling a chilling new message to NATO about the escalating tensions in the region.\nFollowing Thursday’s dramatic strike, which ignited discussions regarding speculation over whether the target was hit by an intercontinental ballistic missile, Russian President Vladimir Putin made an unexpected television appearance to clarify the situation.\nHe asserted that the missile employed in this attack is a novel, intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of reaching its target at a staggering Mach 10 — ten times the speed of sound.\n“Modern air defense systems that exist in the world and anti-missile defenses created by the Americans in Europe can’t intercept such missiles,” Mr. Putin asserted, his voice underscoring the ominous nature of his message.\nThe strike represents the first operational use of this missile type in the ongoing conflict and marks a watershed moment in military tactics.\nThese developments unfold amid a backdrop of heightened tensions, as Ukraine has recently targeted Russian sites with advanced American-made missiles after the US lifted restrictions on their deployment, prompting Mr. Putin to lower the threshold for the use of Moscow’s nuclear capabilities.\nMr. Putin revealed that the missile is named “Oreshnik,” which translates to “hazelnut tree” in English, and claimed that this initial combat test has been a resounding success.\nHe previously announced in July that Russia would begin production of intermediate-range missiles in response to US plans for similar deployments, reiterating the notion that the development of the Oreshnik was a countermeasure to foreign missile advancements.\nIntermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) are designed to travel distances ranging from 310 to 3,400 miles. According to Ukrainian military sources, this particular missile was launched from the Caspian Sea region in Astrakhan, situated approximately 500 miles to the east of the Ukrainian target.\nWhile Russia has previously launched cruise missiles from even greater distances, the use of an intermediate-range missile signifies a notable escalation in the use of ground-launched ballistic missiles, which can deliver significantly heavier conventional payloads and may also be equipped with multiple nuclear warheads.\nMr. Putin proclaimed that this missile is part of Russia’s advanced arsenal of hypersonic weapons, capable of successfully evading Western missile defenses due to its unmatched speed.\nMatthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, emphasized that the strike demonstrated a weapon with an unparalleled range — possibly the first of its kind employed in combat.\nHe highlighted that the missile can unleash multiple warheads traveling at extremely high velocities, although he noted that these are typically less precise than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles.\nFootage of the strike revealed six fiery trajectories followed by substantial explosions, indicating the potential use of multiple warheads, though the accuracy of the videos remains unverified.\nAddressing Mr. Putin’s assertion regarding Western missile defense systems’ inability to intercept such missiles, Mr. Savill stated, “these are quite hard to defend against,” even for advanced systems like the US Patriot missile defense.\n“You’re dropping multiple independently targetable warheads, MIRVs, at extremely high speed, so even Patriot will struggle to basically intercept those,” he elaborated.\nMr. Putin characterized Thursday’s missile launch as a direct response to recent Ukrainian strikes against Russian military targets in the Bryansk and Kursk regions, which were executed using Western-provided weaponry.\nThese Ukrainian military operations reportedly resulted in casualties among Russian personnel, leading the Kremlin leader to assert that such acts elevate the conflict to a “global character.”\n“We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,” Mr. Putin emphasized, warning that in the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, Russia would react decisively in a reciprocal manner.\nIf further strikes are conducted using this new missile, Mr. Putin indicated that Russia would provide prior warnings to civilians to facilitate evacuation as a “humanitarian” gesture, asserting that such notifications would not undermine the effectiveness of the attack due to the inherent speed of the missile.\n“I would recommend the ruling elites of the countries that are hatching plans to use their military contingents against Russia to seriously think about it,” Mr. Putin added solemnly.\nMr. Savill commented on the implications of the new missile, suggesting it sends a chilling message from Russia that “we’ve got stuff that outrages you.”\nIn a show of escalating rhetoric, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council chaired by Mr. Putin, criticized the West while sharing a video of the missile strike on Ukraine.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vehemently condemned the missile strike and accused Moscow of utilizing Ukraine as a testing ground for its sophisticated weaponry, stating, “Today, our insane neighbour has once again shown what they truly are, and how they despise dignity, freedom, and human life itself. And how terrified they are.”\n​ How does the “Oreshnik” missile’s capability to ⁢travel at Mach 10 challenge existing air defense ⁤systems, according to Dr. Elena Volkov? **Interview with Military Expert Dr. Elena Volkov on the Recent ⁤”Oreshnik” Missile Launch**\n*Host:* Good evening and welcome to our ​military ​update segment. Today,‌ we have Dr. Elena Volkov, ‍a renowned expert ‍in military strategy and missile defense, joining us to discuss the recent launch of Russia’s new “Oreshnik” intermediate-range ballistic missile. Dr. Volkov, thank you for being here.\n*Dr. Volkov:* Thank you ‍for having me. It’s a pleasure to be here, albeit under such serious circumstances.\n*Host:* Let’s dive right in. Russian President Vladimir Putin claims that the “Oreshnik” missile cannot be intercepted by modern air defense systems. From a military standpoint, how significant is this allegation?\n*Dr. Volkov:* Putin’s assertion is alarming. The capability to deploy a missile traveling at​ Mach 10 presents serious⁣ challenges for existing defense systems, including the U.S. ⁣Patriot missile defense. When you factor in that this missile could potentially carry multiple independently targetable warheads, it becomes an even ⁣more complex threat‍ to intercept.\n*Host:* This is ‌the first operational use of an intermediate-range ballistic missile in the conflict. What implications does⁣ this have for the current military​ dynamics?\n*Dr. Volkov:* This‍ marks a significant ‌escalation in the conflict. Traditionally, the firing of intermediate-range missiles has been taboo due to their potential ⁤to carry⁤ nuclear payloads. By deploying the “Oreshnik,” Russia demonstrates not only technological advancements but also a willingness to expand its tactical ⁣options, which can‍ lead to increased military tensions in ​the region.\n*Host:* Speaking‍ of tensions, how do ⁣you interpret Putin’s statement that this launch was a⁣ direct response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory using Western-supplied weapons?\n*Dr.​ Volkov:* It indicates a clear shift towards ⁣retaliation and deterrence. Putin is positioning this missile as a demonstrative countermeasure, sending a message to both ⁢Ukraine and NATO⁤ that any aggression will⁤ be met with overwhelming force. However, this cycle of retaliation could ⁣escalate⁢ dangerously, leading to unintended consequences.\n*Host:* Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy condemned the ‌missile use,​ calling it a⁢ test ground for new weaponry. How might ​this affect Ukraine’s strategy moving forward?\n*Dr. Volkov:* Zelenskiy’s remarks ​highlight a vulnerability; Ukraine may feel compelled to accelerate ⁤its own military advancements or ⁣rely on additional Western support to ‌counteract these developments. The character of warfare is shifting, ⁤and ⁤Ukraine’s response may involve seeking stronger ​offensive capabilities ⁤to level the playing field against such high-tech threats.\n*Host:* With ​the introduction of missiles like the “Oreshnik,” what should NATO’s ⁢next steps be in terms of defense and deterrence?\n*Dr. Volkov:* NATO must reassess its defense posture in Eastern Europe. This involves not only the modernization of existing defense systems but also ​investing in new technologies ‍that can address emerging threats. ⁣Increased intelligence sharing and collaboration within NATO allies will be ⁢crucial, as⁤ well as ongoing support for Ukraine to ensure they are not left vulnerable.\n*Host:* Thank you,‍ Dr. Volkov, for ⁤your insights on this⁢ critical issue. ‍It’s clear ⁣that the implications of the ⁣”Oreshnik” missile extend far beyond ​the battlefield.\n*Dr. Volkov:* Thank you. It’s important for the international community to stay vigilant and proactive in ⁤addressing ‌these developments.\n*Host:* We appreciate your time. That concludes our segment on the recent launch of⁣ the ‍”Oreshnik” missile. ‌Stay tuned for more updates ‍on this evolving situation.",

As the name suggests, Cronos is a \"twisted time travel story\". In the reveal during the Xbox Partner Preview, we saw a strange astronaut-styled character sitting with an old woman in her home, playing chess, interspersed with clips of the strange spaceman exploring a trippy rundown future while fighting Necromorph-like enemies. Details are scarce right now about what we can expect, but the YouTube description tells us that it's \"Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology\". We got a very brief snippet of gameplay right at the end of the trailer, showing the player walking through ruins at night with corpses sprouting from the rubble, but it cuts to black right before an encounter with one of the enemies. Screenshots on the Steam page give us a bit more to chew on, with a strange pod illuminated in red, a swirling orange storm in the sky above crumbling buildings playing fast and loose with the laws of gravity, and the player in a metro car aiming at one of the strange, humanoid monsters. It all looks very Dead Space . Cronus in Greek mythology is the Titan leader and father to Zeus, while Chronos is the Greek god of time. Bloober's new game appears to be taking inspiration from both legends. Bloober Team is coming hot off the press with the Silent Hill 2 remake, which sold a staggering one million copies in just three days . Despite trepadation surrounding the remake, given Bloober's less favourable recent releases like Layers of Fears, it was a major hit with reviewers, garnering an aggregate score of 87 on OpenCritic . Fingers crossed Cronos is more Silent Hill 2 Remake than Blair Witch, eh? You can wishlist Cronos: The New Dawn here .",

    "text": "It was reflexive, an impulse buy at the beer store headed into the July 4 th holiday weekend. There on the shelf was the baby blue and bright orange 12 pack. Oberon, the extended summer American wheat ale from Bell’s Brewing.\nOut of nostalgia and obligation I added it to the cart.\nNot too long ago the idea of summer specific offerings from larger breweries was met with excitement and reverence. Sam Adams Summer Ale comes to mind as one that led a generation of beer drinkers to wish for the warm weather as soon as it arrived every Spring. Bright and lemony, it never crossed into the soda like sweetness offered by shandies. Sam Summer, first introduced in the mid 1990s – was exciting because it was a limited run, it conjured up ideas of hot afternoons on the lake, camping, or just hanging around a backyard cookout.\nAt some point years ago the Boston Beer, the company behind the brand, changed the recipe by using what they said were different lemons. That taste was more artificial, and a bit of soul was lost. It never regained that snap and vibrancy it once had, at least for me. The brewery would again change the recipe in 2019.\nNow, before you roll your eyes, this is not another column where a guy who has been writing about beer for a long time laments that the landscape has changed and wants things to go backwards. It’s perfectly reasonable that palates change as do life experiences. Sam Summer lives happily in my mind in a good way for my mid-to-late 20s. There are drinkers today who still get those experiences in their own way today, and I’m happy for them.\nSummer Refreshment I was at the local beer store to buy a 30 pack of Genesee cream ale when I saw the Oberon. Genny Cream is a beer I’ve had a fascination and fondness for as long as I can remember. Simple green and white cans, easy drinking, thirst quenching. There are no frills, no grand tasting notes, nothing to say except it’s a beer that does the job it’s supposed to do.\nBeing the editor of a beer publication is a charmed life. There are a lot of samples that come into the office that I gladly drink and catalogue and take tasting notes on. There are occasionally leftovers, and on a holiday weekend like July 4, I will load up one cooler of those hoppy and experimental ales and lagers to bring them to parties where my beer loving friends will be present. They can dig around and find something that strikes their stout or hazy fancy.\nA second cooler is filled with Genny and that’s what I go back to again and again. It’s simple, consistent, pairs with everything coming off the grill, and keeps me hydrated. It’s a tradition I’ve created for myself that fits a long weekend where I try to unplug from work.\nFading Rays Which brings be back to Oberon .\nBell’s Brewery, now owned by Kirin, has put significant marketing behind Oberon. There’s a big party at the brewery to celebrate its annual launch. Some line extensions have been introduced.\nFor craft beer drinkers of a certain age, and for new ones coming of age, the familiar sun logo – a cross between a bumper on CBS Sunday Morning and the angry sun in Super Mario Bros. 3 – is a visual Pavlovian cue that warm weather is upon us.\nI opened the first can of the 12-pack about an hour before I was compelled to sit down at the table to write this. I had two more in quick succession to confirm my suspicions. This is a perfectly OK beer. The orange peel comes through, the medium body keeps the taste buds engaged and the tongue a bit fat. A 5.8% abv gets the good time going a bit faster than other summer seasonals. This year, for me, it was just tasting a bit different, a little diminished.\nI recall fondly summers, in my late 30s, on the lake whiling away the hours, going through cases of this with friends. We all (mostly) have kids now, so the abv does more harm than good come the next day.\nAt this point in my life Oberon is a good nostalgia beer. It brings back more memories than it does help make new ones. I suspect there are drinkers out there that feel the same way, as well as younger ones who feel the opposite.\nForever summer Summer is a great time to drink beer. Hard Seltzers have taken a lot of the wind out of the summer seasonal beers, but beer lands a bit better than the seltzers and other flavored malt beverages, there’s something that and a little more soul to it. Something that feels a little more real, substantial.\nThere was a time in craft beer where watermelon wedges were served with watermelon ales, or blueberries added to pints of blueberry summer ales. They added visual pop and flavor to these beers and reminded us of where we were on the calendar.\nSeasons are fleeting. The older we get the faster they seem to go. Having a drink of nostalgia brings happier times to the forefront of the mind. Breweries of all sizes now make their own summer seasonal, and this column, if nothing else, is an encouragement to get out there to make some warm weather memories with new-to-you beers.\nAnd for those drinkers who don’t want to let go of summer no matter what the calendar says, MolsonCoors announced that its Leinenkugel’s Summer Shandy is now available year-round.\nFor me? I’m happy. Oktoberfest lagers have been on shelves since early August and Labor Day weekend means it’s almost time for the winter warmers to arrive, and with it fresh nostalgia.\nSince 1979 All About Beer has offered engaging and in-depth articles and interviews covering every aspect of brewing and beer culture.
