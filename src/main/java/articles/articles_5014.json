    "text": "Andrei Iosivas caught two touchdown passes and Joe Mixon ran for one and caught another as the Cincinnati Bengals ended their season with a 31-14 win over the visiting Cleveland Browns Sunday.\nJake Browning threw three touchdowns for the Bengals (9-8), finishing 18-of-24 passing with 156 yards and one interception before being replaced by AJ McCarron late in the third quarter.\nThe Browns (11-6), who failed to secure their first 12-win season since 1986, rested many of their starters with the fifth seed in the AFC sewn up. Wide receiver Amari Cooper, defensive end Myles Garrett and cornerback Greg Newsome II were all inactive.\nIt was a day of milestones for the Bengals, who finished with a winning record for the third straight season under head coach Zac Taylor.\nCincinnati’s victory ensured all four AFC North teams finished the season with a winning record, marking the first such instance since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger and the first in the NFL since 1935.\nThe two-time defending AFC North champion Bengals were dethroned this year by the Baltimore Ravens and eliminated from playoff contention with last week’s 25-17 loss in Kansas City.\nMixon ran for a season-high 111 yards on 14 carries, giving him 1,034 on the season. His two touchdowns earned Mixon a substantial bonus, per his restructured contract last July.\nJa’Marr Chase finished with four catches for 19 yards. Chase finished with 100 catches on the season, matching Carl Pickens in 1996 for second-most in team history.\nWith the Browns resting starting quarterback Joe Flacco, Jeff Driskel started and played the entire game, going 13-of-26 for 166 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Driskel, signed last week off Arizona’s practice squad, ended Cincinnati’s shutout bid on a fourth-and-4 from the Bengals 31 when he found David Bell in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown.\nBell caught another touchdown pass, a 24-yarder on Cleveland’s next possession, to make it 31-14.\nMixon had a 44-yard run in the first half on the drive that ended in his 6-yard touchdown catch.\nThe Bengals drove 99 yards in 14 plays on their second drive of the third quarter to go up 31-0. The drive was kept alive by Cleveland’s fourth encroachment penalty as Cincinnati was lining up to go for fourth down. Later, the rookie Iosivas caught his second TD of the day on a 7-yard play.\nBengals pass rusher Trey Hendrickson finished with a half-sack, giving him 17.5 for the season, 1.5 sack shy of T.J. Watt and the NFL lead.\n–Field Level Media",

    "text": "A water shortage is causing facilities to close. A water shortage has driven the National Park Service (NPS) to temporarily close hotel accommodations on the South Rim of [Grand Canyon National Park](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/grand-canyon-national-park-public-health-update.htm) starting Thursday afternoon, at the beginning of the Labor Day holiday weekend. The shortage is caused by breaks in the waterline that supplies fresh water from the Colorado River at the base of the canyon for use in the park’s visitor facilities. The NPS notes that no water is currently being pumped to either rim of the canyon using the Transcanyon Waterline, which was first built in the 1960s to provide water for the fast-growing number of visitors. [Xanterra](https://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/), which has the contract to operate the park’s concessions, has indicated that it will be unable to accommodate overnight guests from August 29 through September 4 while emergency repairs are made to the water pipes. While overnight accommodations are closed to guests, the park remains open for day use, and the visitor center, clinic, post office, and dining facilities remain open. Hotels, grocery stores, and services outside the park in the towns of Tusayan and Williams will also remain open, and the Grand Canyon Railway will continue services between Williams and the South Rim of the canyon, but guests traveling on packages that include overnights in the South Rim may need to rebook or amend their packages to move their lodging to the Grand Canyon Railway Hotel in Williams. Recommended Fodor’s Video Campgrounds also remain open, but only “dry camping” is permitted because of the water restrictions. The park will keep water faucets flowing in bathrooms. Fires will also be prohibited. The Park Service is also asking residents and visitors to conserve water by limiting showers, turn off faucets while shaving or brushing teeth, and operate clothes washers with full loads. The National Park Service has a multi-year plan for upgrades to the Transcanyon Waterline, which has “exceeded its expected lifespan” and has experienced significant failures over the last 15 years. The water delivery upgrades are expected to be completed in 2027. The park has had periodic water restrictions in place since early July in response to smaller breaks in the Transcanyon Waterline and other supporting water delivery systems. Accommodations affected by the closure include the El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Maswik Lodge, and Phantom Ranch, plus the Yavapai Lodge and Trailer Village. Restaurants at these lodges, however, remain open—only overnight accommodations are affected by the water restrictions. Guests planning to visit the Grand Canyon for day use can visit the [park’s operational page](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/grand-canyon-national-park-public-health-update.htm) for updates on the status of facilities in the park each day. If lodging shortages ultimately persist past the Labor Day weekend, causing lodging in Williams and Tusayan to sell out, there is a significant amount of lodging available in Flagstaff, Arizona, 79 miles away. Nearly six million visitors visit Grand Canyon National Park each year, making it the second most visited national park in the country after Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee/North Carolina border.",

    "text": "Get a Kick from MLS GO Eau Claire United Soccer Club launches new affordable, accessible youth soccer program An exciting new youth soccer option is making its debut in Eau Claire this fall, and it’s designed to make the sport affordable, accessible, and above all fun for boys and girls aged 10 and under. MLS GO – the official recreational youth soccer program of Major League Soccer – will be operated in the Chippewa Valley by Eau Claire United Soccer Club. MLS GO is an extension of [Eau Claire United’s](https://www.ecusoccer.org/recreation) nearly 30-year history of helping build kids’ love of soccer. “When you can put on a jersey that looks like what the professionals wear, that excites kids,” said Ryan McKone, an Eau Claire United parent, coach, board member, and now program director for MLS GO. Beginning Sept. 17, the local MLS GO program will run for four weeks, then restart next May for an additional eight weeks. Each week will include one practice and one game, and Eau Claire United will provide coaching as well as mentorship from older high school and travel team members. “Not only can they give back, but these younger players can look up to them,” he said. Since forming in 1995, Eau Claire United has been known for highly competitive travel teams, and in recent years it has extended its programming to include an academy to give younger players a higher-level experience as well as added the TOPSoccer Program, which is open to young people with intellectual, emotional, and physical disabilities. “Our mission is to teach fundamental soccer, instill confidence, and build a love for the game of soccer,” McKone said. “This mission should not just be available to individuals who have the means to afford travel soccer.” “Our mission is to teach fundamental soccer, instill confidence, and build a love for the game of soccer.” In recent years, Eau Claire United has been working to start a low-cost recreational program, and earlier this year discovered that Major League Soccer had created just the kind of option it was looking for: MLS GO. The organization applied and was selected as local partner for the project. “We are excited because the partnership with MLS GO helps to remove any cost barriers to playing soccer while getting a training curriculum developed by Major League Soccer,” McKone said. MLS GO is designed to be low-cost: It’s $35 for EC United members and $95 for non-members. In addition, participants can apply for grants from the [MLS GO PLAY FUND](https://www.mlssoccer.com/mlsgo/play-fund/) on the MLS GO website to offset these costs. Registration is now open, and McKone said Eau Claire United hopes to get 50 to 75 kids aged 10 and under involved this fall. Ultimately, the goal is to start small and make sure the program is successful before growing to meet the demands of the community. “For parents, this is an excellent program to get your child started in the game of soccer at an affordable cost,” he said. “What you will see is coaching resources and training that will more than exceed anyone’s expectations. This is a great beginning to a pathway into more competitive travel soccer or to continue on a pathway of local recreational soccer.” As for the kids, they’ll build connections with other players, coaches, and volunteers; get to play in cool-looking MLS-branded jerseys, shorts, and socks; and develop what may become a lifelong affinity for the world’s most popular sport. “When you go to the soccer park on a given night, there’s lots of communities playing,” McKone added. “We want to pull all those groups together to create a United soccer community in the Chippewa Valley.” MLS GO / Eau Claire United Soccer Club [admin@ecusoccer.org] [ecusoccer.org/recreation] [mlssoccer.com/mlsgo] [facebook.com/ECUSoccer]",

    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 6 : All government and private schools in the national capital will resume physical classes with immediate effect after the Directorate of Education (DoE) has issued a circular.\nThis decision comes after the Supreme Court allowed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to implement the Graded Response Action Plan-II (GRAP) restrictions.\nAs per the Delhi government order, all the government and private schools in Delhi can conduct classes in physical mode with immediate effect.\n\"All government, government-aided, and unaided recognised private schools under the DoE, NDMC, MCD, and Delhi Cantonment Board are required to conduct all classes in physical mode with immediate effect,\" the circular said.\nOn November 17, in-person classes were shifted to online mode, except for classes 10 and 12, due to the 'severe plus' air quality index in the national capital.\nHowever, on November 18, offline classes for classes 10 and 12 were also moved online.\nThe Centre's air quality panel for Delhi-NCR revoked restrictive pollution control measures under stages 3 and 4 of the anti-pollution control plan for winters, according to an official order.\nThe restrictions have been reduced to Stage 2 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) which involves less stringent curbs such as a ban on the use of coal and firewood in industries and commercial establishments, including eateries.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court allowed the relaxation of stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures, which was in force to tackle the severe air quality in Delhi.\nWith the SC relaxation, the government will take a call in the next few hours on lifting the bans from certain activities.\nThe government may lift the ban on truck entry and a temporary halt on construction at public projects.\nThe authorities can also allow physical classes in schools and colleges.\nDespite the easing of some restrictions, certain measures remain in effect under Stage Two. The use of coal and firewood, including tandoors in hotels, restaurants, and open eateries, continues to be prohibited.\nNoting that the AQI level in the National Capital Region (NCR) did not cross 300 in the last four days, the top court told the CAQM that stage-3 curbs would be introduced if AQI crossed the 350 mark and stage-4 curbs if AQI crossed 400.\nDelhiites breathed cleaner air for the second consecutive day on Thursday as the AQI was recorded in the \"moderate\" category with a reading of 165.",

Here’s what we know about Gypsy Rose Blanchard. Who is Gypsy Rose? Gypsy, who is Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard’s daughter, was made to believe she suffered from a wide range of medical ailments including leukemia, asthma and muscular dystrophy thanks to her mother. Gypsy’s late mother was accused of having made her daughter appear to have a range of physical and developmental ailments, USA Today previously [reported. ](/story/news/nation/2023/12/28/gypsy-rose-blanchard-release-thursday/72047355007/) Dee Dee Blanchard, later said to have [Munchausen syndrome by proxy](/story/news/crime/2016/07/06/munchausen-expert-says-gypsy-blanchard-case-unprecedented/86763054/) which is a mental condition in which someone makes another person ill for sympathy or gain received disability payments and gifts from charities all of Gypsy’s illnesses, that often led to painful treatment and procedures. Gypsy, who used a [wheelchair before it was discovered she could walk](/story/news/crime/2015/06/16/daughter-boyfriend-charged-murder-dee-dee-blancharde/28803189/), said she was desperate to escape her mother's abuse and sought help from her online boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn. [Godejohn, who was was sentenced to life in prison](/story/news/crime/2019/02/22/nicholas-godejohn-sentenced-life-prison-blanchard-murder/2949249002/) for stabbing and killing Dee Dee Blanchard traveled to Missouri on [ June 9, 2015](/story/news/local/ozarks/2015/06/15/greene-county-sheriffs-office-searching-mother-daughter/71236652/) to help enact the escape plan. He was reportedly let into the home after Gypsy’s late mother fell asleep and used a knife handed to him by Gypsy to stab the sleeping woman 17 times, killing her before fleeing to his native Wisconsin, USA Today previously reported. Gypsy later told [ABC 20/20 news](https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-wheelchair-bound-woman-treated-illnesses-ended-prison/story?id=52138979) she hid in the bathroom with hands over her ears during the act.

Before Gypsy was publicly tied to the murder, many Springfield residents were worried that she was also in peril.

    "text": "(WWJ) - A woman is facing multiple charges, including torture, after authorities said she allegedly abused her boyfriend’s mother while she was in the woman's care. 40-year-old Laura Tisdelle, of Sterling Heights, was bound over to face the charges on Dec. 27, officials said. Tisdelle’s boyfriend returned home on June 21, after a five day trip, and allegedly found his mother “with her hands tied together, restrained to the bed, severely beaten and laying in her own urine and feces,” the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office said in a written statement. At the time of his trip, Tisdelle was the sole caregiver for the victim at her Sterling Heights home. Tisdelle has been charged with torture, vulnerable adult abuse in the first degree, unlawful imprisonment and domestic violence 3rd by the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office Senior Crimes Unit, authorities said. Torture is a life felony, adult abuse and unlawful imprisonment are both 15-year felonies and domestic violence is a five year felony. “We are committed to pursuing justice for the alleged torture and abuse inflicted upon this elderly woman. This commitment drives us to passionately advocate for the dignity and well-being of individuals who are unable to protect themselves,” Macomb County Prosecutor Peter J. Lucido said. Tisdelle’s next court date is on Jan. 8 in Macomb County Circuit Court.",

Tutti i voli previsti per questo venerdì sono cancellati\", ha dichiarato l'aeroporto di Charleroi in un comunicato, consigliando ai passeggeri di non recarsi in aeroporto ma di contattare la propria compagnia aerea.\nSecondo il suo sito web, almeno 87 voli dovevano partire dall'aeroporto venerdì e sei di questi sarebbero partiti invece dall'aeroporto di Bruxelles, a circa 70 km di distanza.\nLo sciopero è iniziato come uno sciopero selvaggio, ha dichiarato il sindacato CNE ai media belgi giovedì, in quanto i sindacati stavano ancora organizzando l'azione che avevano annunciato la settimana scorsa.\nI sindacati e l'aeroporto sono in trattativa da mesi per migliorare le condizioni di lavoro dei dipendenti.\nCondividi Accedi all'articolo originale .\nAvviso legale Avviso legale\nContattaci per qualunque richiesta di correzione\nIndietro © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "GHAZIABAD, Mar 8: President Droupadi Murmu on Friday said the Indian Air Force’s contribution to the nation’s service is etched in “golden letters” and it is not only guarding the skies but also making a paramount contribution to the country’s space programme.\nIn her address at a ceremony held at the Hindan Air Force Station to award President’s Standard and Colours to four units of the IAF, Murmu said she believed that more and more women will sign up for the force and serve the nation and emphasised that increased representation of women in the force will make it “more inclusive”.\nShe also extended her wishes to women on International Women’s Day.\nThe President is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.\nThe IAF’s contribution to the nation’s service in protecting the country is “etched in golden letters”, she said.\n“It is a matter of joy that the IAF is not only guarding our skies but also making a paramount contribution to India’s space programme,” the President said.\nThe President said the four astronauts chosen to be part of the Gaganyaan mission are IAF officers.\nGaganyaan — the country’s maiden human space flight mission — envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching a crew of three members to an orbit of 400 km for a three-day mission and bringing them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters, according to ISRO website. Names of these astronauts are — Gp Capt Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, Gp Capt Ajit Krishnan, Gp Capt Angad Pratap Wg Cdr Shubhanshu Shukla — who are all fighter pilots in the IAF.\nPresident Murmu also said, that besides guarding land, sea and air, today it’s also essential to protect cyberspace and laboratories.\nShe also said it was “a matter of joy that women are being provided equal opportunities in all branches of the Indian Air Force”.\nThey are being “encouraged” to make a career in the Air Force, she said while expressing confidence that in coming times, “more and more girls will join the Air Force and serve the country”.\n“And, increased representation of women in the Air Force will make this Force more inclusive,” Murmu added.\nIn her address after the ceremony, the President said she was pleased to know that the IAF has been adopting modern technologies in the last few years.\n“I praise the contribution made by serving and former air warriors and officers in the service of the nation. The air warriors have shown amazing courage, dedication and self-sacrifice in the wars of 1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999.\n“Even in peacetime, they have contributed to relief, and rescue work and rendered humanitarian aid in the country and abroad. Their devotion to duty is a matter of inspiration for all Indians,” she said.\nShe also underlined the ‘Operation Safed Sagar’ undertaken by the IAF during the 1999 Kargil war.\nThe President also touched upon the role of evolving technology in the growth of a force like the IAF.\nIn this rapidly changing era, defence-related “requirements and priorities also changing fast”. Akin to other sectors, the role of technology is also growing in the defence sector, she said.\nIn her address, she also highlighted some of the milestones achieved by the four units since their inception.\nMurmu presented the President’s Standard to 45 Squadron and 221 Squadron and President’s Colours to 11 Base Repair Depot and 509 Signal Unit. (PTI)\nDuring the ceremony, three IAF helicopters also gave the President an “aerial salute”.\nThe 45 Squadron, also called the ‘Flying Daggers’, was raised in 1959. The squadron took part in ‘Operation Vijay’ for the liberation of Goa from Portuguese rule in 1960.\nThe 221 squadron is known as the ‘Valiants’. It was raised on February 14, 1963, in Barrackpore equipped with Vampire aircraft. Barely two years after its formation, the squadron was pressed into action in the Eastern theatre during the 1965 India-Pakistan war, where it made commendable contributions. (PTI)",
