    "text": "Arsenal missed out on the chance to return to the Premier League summit on Thursday, losing 2-0 to West Ham as Tottenham went down in a six-goal thriller at Brighton.Mikel Arteta's Gunners were top of the tree at Christmas for a second successive year but trail leaders Liverpool by two points at the halfway point of the season.Last year's runners-up dominated possession at the Emirates but lacked a cutting edge against the disciplined visitors, for whom Tomas Soucek and former Arsenal player Konstantinos Mavropanos scored the goals.Soucek opened the scoring from close range in the 13th minute following a pass from Jarrod Bowen, with the goal confirmed after a lengthy VAR check looking into whether the ball had gone out of play.Arsenal surged forward in relentless waves and West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola made a fine reaction save from a Bukayo Saka header on the half-hour.The England winger hit the post from a tight angle as the clock ticked down towards half-time but Arsenal trailed at the break despite enjoying nearly three-quarters of possession.The Gunners came out determined to find a response but instead they found themselves 2-0 down when Mavropanos's bullet header cannoned in off the crossbar from James Ward-Prowse's corner.Gabriel Jesus failed to beat Areola with a header when well-placed and shortly afterwards missed another glorious opportunity with his head at the back post.Arsenal continued to bombard the visitors' goal but could not find a breakthrough and it could have been worse had Said Benrahma managed to convert a late penalty.Defeat leaves the Gunners in second place on 40 points, one clear of Aston Villa and three ahead of Manchester City, who have a game in hand.Arteta said his team deserved more for their dominance.\"We want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed,\" he told the BBC.\"We had so much dominance in the game. We are in a really good position. Today is a disappointing night. We have to pick ourselves up for a big game against Fulham.\"He added: \"The players put an enormous effort in. It's a difficult dressing room right now but we have another game in 72 hours. This is football, we have to improve in certain areas.\"West Ham manager David Moyes celebrated his team's rise to sixth in the table.\"We are not one of the top teams,\" he told Amazon Prime. \"We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe (they topped their Europa League group) is a great period.\"Tottenham, this season's early pacesetters, remain in fifth spot after losing 4-2 despite threatening an astonishing comeback from 4-0 down against Roberto De Zerbi's Brighton.Jack Hinshelwood finished with brutal power to put the home side ahead following a weaving run from Joao Pedro along the edge of the penalty area.Brighton doubled their lead from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute through Pedro, who took full advantage after Dejan Kulusevski was penalised for a pull on Welbeck.Brazil forward Richarlison twice had the ball in the net after the break but both times he was ruled offside.Pervis Estupinan stretched the lead with a thunderbolt from 30 yards in the 63rd minute and Pedro scored a second penalty 12 minutes later.Alejo Veliz grabbed what appeared to be a consolation goal in the 81st minute but it galvanised the visitors.Ben Davies headed home Pedro Porro's deep cross as Spurs threatened to cut through every time they poured forward, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post during nine frantic minutes of stoppage time.But Brighton withstood the intense pressure to take all three points.\"I am really lucky to be this coach of this team with these players,\" De Zerbi told the BBC. \"I am very pleased with the passion they have, they have everything.\"You can't forget we are Brighton. Sometimes they forget we are Brighton. We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton.\"© ",

    "title": "Earnings Tell The Story For Bokusgruppen AB (publ) (STO:BOKUS) As Its Stock Soars 29%",
    "text": "Sweden- /\nSpecialty Stores- /\n- OM:BOKUS\nEarnings Tell The Story For Bokusgruppen AB (publ) (STO:BOKUS) As Its Stock Soars 29%\nBokusgruppen AB (publ) (STO:BOKUS) shares have continued their recent momentum with a 29% gain in the last month alone. The last 30 days bring the annual gain to a very sharp 46%.\nEven after such a large jump in price, there still wouldn't be many who think Bokusgruppen's price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 22.3x is worth a mention when the median P/E in Sweden is similar at about 24x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nBokusgruppen certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.\n Check out our latest analysis for Bokusgruppen\nfree report on Bokusgruppenwill help you uncover what's on the horizon.\nDoes Growth Match The P/E?\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Bokusgruppen would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 11%. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen an unpleasant 31% overall drop in EPS. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 18% per year during the coming three years according to the sole analyst following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 18% each year, which is not materially different.\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Bokusgruppen's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.\nThe Final Word\nIts shares have lifted substantially and now Bokusgruppen's P/E is also back up to the market median. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\nAs we suspected, our examination of Bokusgruppen's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook is contributing to its current P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.\nDon't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Bokusgruppen that you should be aware of.\nOf course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Bokusgruppen. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have reasonable P/E ratios and have grown earnings strongly.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Bokusgruppen might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nAccess Free Analysis\nHave feedback on this article?
