    "title": "Equidad promete \"fichajes top\" y aclara el futuro de Alexis García con el nuevo grupo inversor",
    "text": "La Equidad ha sido adquirida oficialmente por el grupo inversor estadounidense Tylis-Porter Group , liderado por Albert Tylis y Sam Porter , marcando el inicio de una “ nueva era ” para el club y el fútbol colombiano en general. Esta compra no solo representa un cambio para la institución, sino que también podría incentivar a otros grupos extranjeros a interesarse por el balompié nacional.\nEn el comunicado oficial dado este jueves 16 de enero, el equipo bogotano destacó que el proceso fue exitoso y contó con la aprobación de la Dimayor .\nLos nuevos propietarios tienen un notable historial en diversas disciplinas, y cuentan con el respaldo de celebridades como Rob McElhenney, Ryan Reynolds , Eva Longoria y Justin Verlander , lo que refuerza la proyección internacional del club.\nEntre los planes de la nueva administración están la mejora de las fuerzas básicas, el fortalecimiento del equipo femenino y la inversión en jugadores de alto nivel para elevar la calidad del plantel. La adquisición se realizó por un valor superior a los 30 millones de dólares, y Al Tylis y Sam Porter asumirán como copresidentes , junto a Nicolás Maya y Carlos Mario Zuluaga , quien seguirá en el cargo para asegurar la estabilidad del club.\nSobre los nuevos movimientos del club, su presidente, Carlos Mario Zuluaga, habló en exclusiva con El Vbar de Caracol Radio. Estas fueron las declaraciones del dirigente:\nLa llegada de los nuevos inversionistas : “Cambia mucho en el sentido en que esta es una organización, que afortunadamente, ellos se encuentran en muy buen estado administrativo y financiero. Pero lo que quieren también es proyectar no solo nacional sino a nivel internacional, o sea que cambian las políticas, las metas y los objetivos . Y pues, lógicamente, eso va amarrado a la inversión, entonces creo que vamos a tener una Equidad grande como hemos querido en los últimos años”.\n¿ Vendrán fichajes top con la inversión ? “ Sí, esa es la idea, la verdad es que iremos lógicamente sin enloquecernos, tomando las decisiones a medida que nos lo exija la competencia y el tiempo . Pero esa es la idea, es, con el tiempo, convertir a la Equidad en que no solo forme jugadores, sino que disfrute de los jugadores”.\nLa sede y los cambios en Equidad : “La sede donde estamos ahora, no son propiedad del club, es propiedad del Grupo Cooperativo, no del club. Nosotros acá pagamos un arrendamiento, pero si vamos a continuar en nuestra propia sede, no será nuestra sede, pero desde las raíces lo ha sido. Y en segundo, vale aclarar que tenemos una sede propia que queda cerca a la de Fortaleza, vía Suba-Cota, esa la vamos a potenciar mucho más . En segundo lugar, va a ser a mediano plazo, donde nosotros nos podremos mostrar las inversiones. Hay un jugador muy valioso que llega el día de mañana”.\nReparto de la dirigencia y el proyecto con Alexis García : “Yo soy el presidente ejecutivo y como tal, manejo toda la operación en Colombia. Todo lo que tiene que ver con la parte ejecutiva, financiera y deportiva. Los nuevos inversionistas conformarán la junta directiva con Aldo, Samuel y una tercera persona que es colombo americano, que se llama Nicolás, y él sería el anexo entre el grupo americano y Colombia . Pero el manejo total queda en mi cabeza. Y lo segundo, hemos decidido continuar con el profe Alexis García y su cuerpo técnico, pero sí esperamos los resultados de este semestre”.\nProyecto de las inferiores : “ Dos aspectos muy importantes para el nuevo grupo inversor, La Academia, como lo llamamos nosotros, y el fútbol femenino . Esos son los que, de entrada, van a tener un cambio importante, desde ahí vamos a mostrar una cara distinta. Nosotros tenemos una metodología excelente de formación, ahí la vamos a adaptar a un sistema americano que les ha dado muchos resultados, ellos ya tienen esa experiencia. Ahí vamos a tener un cambio importante”.",

    "title": "How UK fought the country's first fascist groups who were pals with Adolf Hitler - Mirror Online",
    "text": "The attacks against Jews in London, Manchester and Leeds were constant, violent and terrifying.\nGangs paraded in London’ s East End, targeting and abusing Jewish residents, particularly older Orthodox Jews. They could not go down some streets without risking of being set upon by fascists. It is 100 years since the founding of the UK’s first fascist organisation, British Fascisti. Like European far-right parties, it hid behind the national flag, exploited economic discontent and enlisted jackbooted thugs.\nThe arrival of fascism demanded a response. This came October 7, 1923, when the British Fascisti first rally was disrupted by Communist Party members. The next year the People’s Defence Force was set up in London to resist moves to create a fascist party in Britain in the style of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. The battle against the hatred, abuse and violence pushed by the far-right had started. A fight against racism that has not ceased. It has meant taking on Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, the National Front and the British National Party. The battleground has been the streets of Dagenham, Bradford, Liverpool and Glasgow; council chambers and football terraces.\nAt every turn it has involved good people standing up to bad. No sooner had British Fascisti been seen off than a new threat emerged: Mosley’s Blackshirts. Mosley had met Adolf Hitler and Mussolini and was determined to import their warped nationalist dogma into Britain.\nIn June 1934, 1,000 demonstrators outside London’s Olympia protesting against a BUF mass rally were attacked by the party’s stewards. This was a precursor to the 1936 Battle of Cable Street in London’s East End.\nMosley targeted the area because of its large Jewish population. When the Government refused to ban the march by his Blackshirts the local community took matters into their own hands.\nDockers joined forces with the recently formed Jewish People’s Council against Fascism and Antisemitism and built a barricade in the narrow London street. Lou Kenton, whose Jewish Ukrainian family fled Russian persecution for London, recalled the scenes.\nIn a recording for the British Library, he said: “There was real bitter fighting and the police were entirely on the side of the fascists.\n“Cable Street went from being a gallant band holding the fort to a majority. I’ve never seen such a happy crowd.” Mosley was interned as a Nazi sympathiser at the beginning of the Second World War but was released in 1943 and continued to preach his vile propaganda.\nIn response, a small band of Jewish ex-servicemen started 43 Group – an underground organisation aiming to wipe out Mosleyites.\nAmong its earliest members was a 17-year-old hairdresser called Vidal Sassoon. Years later Sassoon recalled his life as a street fighter. We “did not intend to allow the fascists ever again to rule the streets of London,” he wrote.\n“And so it began. We had turned the other cheek for the last time and, as a 17-year-old recruit, I was proud to be involved.”\nThe far-right soon had a second target: the Windrush generation. In 1958 a group of armed white men sparked riots in Notting Hill by driving around West London and attacking West Indian people.\nViolent clashes between anti-racist protesters and the newly formed National Front continued through the 60s and 70s. By 1979 NF was the fourth largest party in Britain, with 303 candidates in that year’s general election .\nTwo years earlier the Anti-Nazi League was started to counter the growing influence of the far-right. The late 70s also saw the birth of Rock Against Racism which staged two huge “carnivals” in 1978 with tens of thousands of people gathering to hear performances by Aswad, The Clash, Elvis Costello, Tom Robinson and Stiff Little Fingers.\nBy the 80s the NF had been superseded by the BNP and its thuggish offshoot, Combat 18.\nAs the BNP started to get a toehold in local councils, anti-fascist campaigners again had to respond. In 2004 the anti-fascist research organisation Searchlight was reborn as Hope Not Hate, which worked with local communities to counter the BNP’s message of division and hatred.\nHope Not Hate’s Nick Lowles said: “We treated all voters – including BNP voters – with respect, understood that many had real or perceived grievances that needed addressing and localised our campaigning.”\nIts work helped defeat the BNP in Barking and Dagenham amid fears the far-right party was poised to take over the East London council in 2010. In 2008 the Mirror joined forces with Hope Not Hate to organise a nationwide bus tour to show Britain’s prevailing spirit of tolerance. A week after the 2001 Oldham Riots, the group stopped the far-right’s plan to invade Old Trafford cricket pitch and fight Pakistan fans. And Lowles praised campaigners such as “Arthur” who risked his life by going undercover for 11 years.\nArthur identified neo-Nazi nail bomber David Copeland, jailed for life for his 1999 attacks against London’s Black, Bangladeshi and gay communities which claimed three lives. Lowles’ priority now is “to galvanise the younger generation” because the impact of climate change, Britain’s declining role in the world, the attacks on democracy and freedoms are “fertile ground” for the far-right.\nHe said: “We’re seeing governments in Europe taken over by the far-right, the possible return of Donald Trump and in the UK we are seeing on the streets an increasingly strong far-right that pose a threat.\nHe added: “We look to the past for inspiration but we have to mobilise to face the challenges of the future.”",

    "text": "TORRANCE, Calif. — A woman was killed after she was attacked with a sledgehammer at a college on Christmas Eve in Torrance, California. The assault happened Sunday just after 7 a.m. in the 16000 block of Crenshaw Boulevard, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said, according to KABC . Investigators say that the victim was collecting recyclables at El Camino College in Torrance when she was attacked, the news station reported. A man with a sledgehammer attacked her and fled the area before law enforcement arrived, according to KTLA. The victim was spotted by the gymnasium by someone passing by the area. Officers found her unconscious and she appeared to be bleeding from her head, the news outlet reported. Her dog stayed at her side. The victim was taken to the hospital where she died a day later on Christmas from her injuries, KTLA reported. The sheriff’s department only identified the victim as an Asian woman between the ages of 60 and 65, according to the Los Angeles Times. Investigators identified the suspect through surveillance footage as Jeffrey Davis, 40, according to KTLA. “The person that we had an idea of who was on the security footage is, we believe, a homeless person we’ve had contact with before,” said Sgt. Francisco Esqueda of El Camino College Police, according to the news outlet. “So we were able to go to the neighboring county park where he sometimes hangs out and that’s where we found him.” Davis was arrested shortly after the incident, the LA Times reported.",

    "text": "Investimento, poupança, metas financeiras para realização de sonhos. Tudo isso faz parte da educação financeira, tema que ainda não faz parte do dia a dia de muitas pessoas. Como organizar seus gastos, reserva de emergência e ainda poupar quando se tem pouco? É por isso que saber trabalhar dentro da sua realidade financeira é tão importante, apontou Nath Finanças em palestra realizada nesta quinta-feira (7), no RD Summit.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nIntitulada “Finanças Reais para Pessoas Reais”, a palestra de Nath abordou em sua exposição principalmente a realidade dos trabalhadores brasileiros, que não costumam ganhar grandes salários. Ainda assim, é possível se organizar financeiramente sem se privar do consumo, dos sonhos ou das compras, mas sim, entendendo qual é sua realidade, se planejando de acordo com ela e tendo conhecimento sobre como investir o dinheiro, explica a especialista.\nDe Boca Rosa a Ana Paula Padrão: tudo o que você precisa saber sobre o RD Summit 2024\nUm dos principais desafios é poupar dinheiro. Por isso, a consultora criou o “Desafio dos 25”, por exemplo. Todas as sextas-feiras ela lembra os seguidores de guardarem R$ 25. O valor pode parecer pequeno, mas é capaz de “salvar” o trabalhador em um momento de imprevistos.\nClique aqui para receber as notícias do NSC Total pelo Canal do WhatsApp\nContinua depois da publicidade\nNath Finanças dá dicas de economia pessoal Nath Finanças lotou auditório (Foto: Green Fotografias, RD Summit, Divulgação) Nath Finanças focou em dicas financeiras para a realidade dos trabalhadores e classes mais baixas (Foto: Green Fotografias, RD Summit, Divulgação) Nath Finanças lotou auditório (Foto: Green Fotografias, RD Summit, Divulgação) Nath Finanças lotou auditório (Foto: Green Fotografias, RD Summit, Divulgação) Dicas da Nath, trazidas em slides na palestra (Foto: Fernanda Silva, NSC) Dicas da Nath, trazidas em slides na palestra (Foto: Fernanda Silva, NSC) Dicas da Nath, trazidas em slides na palestra (Foto: Fernanda Silva, NSC) Dicas da Nath, trazidas em slides na palestra (Foto: Fernanda Silva, NSC) Dicas da Nath, trazidas em slides na palestra (Foto: Fernanda Silva, NSC) Voltar Avançar\n— Uma pessoa que chegou e falou assim: “ah, esse dinheiro salvou o meu mês, meu filho ficou doente e comprei o remédio”. Ele não precisa pegar o cheque especial, um empréstimo ou dívida no cartão de crédito. Então o desafio de 25 vem para isso — exemplifica Nath.\nA educação financeira possibilita que, mesmo dentro da realidade do trabalhador, seja possível planejar, cortar gastos desnecessários e ainda manter sonhos e objetivos de compra.\n— A gente viu nosso pai, mãe, avó fazer milagre com dinheiro, só na verdade, não teve acesso à educação financeira, a entender sobre investimento, como funciona todo o planejamento financeiro e isso tem tudo a ver com a educação financeira no nosso dia a dia. Quando ela vem na nossa vida ela transforma para melhor — diz Nath.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nQuais foram as principais dicas da orientadora financeira Para começar, a consultora explicou que é necessário planejar para onde vai seu dinheiro antes do salário cair. Para isso, Nath separou uma planilha, a qual disponibilizou no evento, dividida nos seguintes tópicos:\nContas fixas: despesas que acontecem todos os meses e que tem valores fixos, que não variam de acordo com o consumo, por exemplo, financiamento de carro e casa, aluguel, empréstimos, educação; Contas variáveis: despesas às quais os valores variam de acordo com o consumo, o que inclui a conta de água, luz, gasolina, farmácia, supermercado; Extras: contas não esperadas, mas que são importantes como pagamentos de tratamento de saúde ou medicação que não estavam sendo previstos; Lazer: contabilizar e planejar os gastos para garantir o lazer e a diversão, desde a ida a uma lanchonete até o churrasco do fim de semana Metas: valor que deve ser guardado mensalmente para alguma aquisição especial. A influenciadora financeira também dá uma dica valiosa sobre como anotar essas despesas: semanalmente. Nath explicou na palestra do RD Summit que quem costuma marcar mensalmente acaba esquecendo de onde são alguns gastos, passa mais tempo em frente ao computador ou celular e cansa das anotações, abandonando o planejamento. Já o diário, demanda uma pausa todos os dias, o que também pode ocasionar desistência.\n— Eu recomendo para vocês fazer uma vez na semana, eu escolho toda sexta-feira. Escolha uma vez na semana para você organizar e você vai você pode tirar 20 minutos. Por mês você fica um tempinho, até lembrar tudo. Eu vejo que é o ideal para quem quer organizar as finanças e se manter ali de forma mais organizada [é mensal] — indica.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nCaixa de emergência e poupança Nath também falou muito na palestra sobre a necessidade de colocar no planejamento o lazer e as metas de vida. Por isso, elas entram nas anotações financeiras. Quer comprar algo em especial, deseja fazer uma reforma, uma viagem para outro estado ou país? Escreva metas alcançáveis e coloque no seu planejamento. De pouco em pouco, é possível realizar.\nInclusive, a especialista explicou que reserva de emergência e poupança são duas “caixas” diferentes. Isso evita que o dinheiro da poupança seja utilizado em imprevistos.\nOutra dica é tornar a poupança de dinheiro um hábito, como no Desafio dos 25, onde todas as sextas-feiras se guarda uma pequena quantia de dinheiro. A consultora afirma que não há fórmula mágica ou um valor certo para poupar, mas que é necessário levar em consideração as individualidades e as realidades de cada família.\n— Quem escutou “guarde de 30% do salário”? Quem ganha R$ 10 mil consegue, agora e quem ganha R$ 1 mil? Essa é a realidade brasileira. Monte uma reserva de 15 em 15 dias que vira [reserva] de um mês. A realidade brasileira é essa, de pouquinho em pouquinho — diz.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nMas como fazer o dinheiro render? Outra dúvida muito frequente é onde colocar o dinheiro que foi poupado. A influenciadora afirma que é necessário prestar atenção em alguns fatores, entre eles se há chance ou não de perder o dinheiro investido e a liquidez, ou seja, quanto tempo demora para que você possa retirar o dinheiro.\nO tesouro direto ou o CDB são opções seguras. Nestes casos, o investidor empresta o dinheiro para o governo ou o banco, respectivamente, e depois recebe o valor de volta com o juros.\n— E aí tem um passo a passo que eu trouxe aqui, um passo a passo bem simples. Seu banco tem provavelmente, precisa baixar a conta para investir, vai criar sua conta e depois você vai transferir o dinheiro e depois você vai descobrir Tesouro SELIC [tesouro direto] ou CDB de liquidez diária. O passo a passo é muito bem simples — ensinou Nath.\n* A repórter Fernanda Silva viajou a São Paulo a convite da RD Station para cobrir o RD Summit 2024\nLeia também E-commerce e WhatsApp com IA: quais são as novidades anunciadas pelo RD Station\n“Incômodo faz você mudar”: Ana Paula Padrão fala sobre mudança de carreira no RD Summit 2024\nDestaques do NSC Total Morador de Joinville fatura torneio milionário de pôquer em luxuoso resort do RJ FOTO: Gambá vai parar em telhado de escola e mobiliza operação de resgate em São José Nath Finanças ensina como organizar o financeiro na \"realidade do trabalhador\" Mega-Sena pode pagar um dos 10 maiores prêmios da história nesta quinta-feira Mega da Virada: Todos os números sorteados na história do concurso “Água Mole, Pedra Dura”: artista manezinha autodidata transforma hobby em fonte de renda Caso Maidê Mahl completa dois meses com perguntas sem respostas Ainda Estou Aqui: Relembre looks de Fernanda Torres em tapetes vermelhos pelo mundo Ainda Estou Aqui: O livro que deu origem ao filme aclamado pela crítica Além de JJ em Outer Banks, conheça 3 personagens de Rudy Pankow Rebeca Andrade doa collant usado durante conquista de medalha em Paris 2024 Filha de ídolo do Flamengo grava com MC que fez música em homenagem ao seu pai Voltar Avançar",

    "text": "SpaceX faz lançamento bem-sucedido de avião espacial; veja Atividades secretas do X-37B no espaço têm sido objeto de fascínio e especulação na comunidade espacial A SpaceX fez um lançamento bem-sucedido do foguete Falcon Heavy, que lançou o avião espacial militar X-37B, na noite desta quinta-feira (28). Veja abaixo as imagens da decolagem. A espaçonave lançada foi enviada ao espaço para os militares dos Estados Unidos e fará pesquisa de ponta no território. Não está claro, porém, exatamente para onde o avião espacial está indo. A decolagem foi feita do Centro Espacial Kennedy da Nasa, na Flórida, às 22h (no horário de Brasília). As atividades do X-37B no espaço têm sido objeto de fascínio e especulação na comunidade espacial, à medida que entusiastas amadores correm para rastrear seu paradeiro e compartilhar teorias sobre suas atividades. Todo o planejamento do lançamento foi cumprido com sucesso, desde a saída do foguete até a separação dos boosters da nave, o lançamento do avião, e o retorno do foguete à base com segurança. Assemelhando-se a um ônibus espacial em miniatura da Nasa com as janelas fechadas, o X-37B reutilizável e totalmente autônomo é conhecido por realizar pesquisas sobre conceitos como retransmitir energia solar do espaço para uso na Terra e estudar os efeitos da radiação nas sementes usadas para cultivar alimentos. Esta missão – a sétima viagem ao espaço de um [avião X-37B](https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/tecnologia/spacex-lanca-aviao-espacial-supersecreto-x-37b-saiba-como-assistir/) – promete ser ainda mais intrigante do que os voos anteriores. Passeio poderoso Este lançamento marca a primeira vez que o avião espacial pega carona em um SpaceX Falcon Heavy, um dos foguetes operacionais mais poderosos do mundo. Anteriormente, o X-37B foi lançado no veículo SpaceX Falcon 9 e no foguete Atlas V construído pela United Launch Alliance, uma joint venture entre a Lockheed Martin e a Boeing. O Falcon Heavy produz mais impulso do que os dois foguetes combinados. O lançamento via Falcon Heavy pode indicar que o X-37B está destinado a órbitas mais distantes, talvez até à Lua ou a Marte, sugeriu Paul Graziani, CEO da COMSPOC, empresa dedicada ao rastreamento de objetos no espaço. Se ele viajar muito mais profundamente no cosmos do que os voos anteriores, poderá ser muito mais difícil para os observadores do céu na Terra determinarem onde o veículo está. Se os militares não quiserem que as pessoas rastreiem o X-37B, acrescentou Graziani, o veículo pode ser escondido sob o brilho do sol ou por vários outros meios – incluindo mudar frequentemente de posição.",

    "text": "Pratiques anticoncurrentielles : l'Union européenne inflige 798 millions d'euros d'amende à Meta [ ](https://img-0.journaldunet.com/Y_vvBYxyYYM5ICerrFvZHk53aBM=/1500x/smart/e0ba1fc908994039a96adf3b973a5faf/ccmcms-jdn/39512602.jpg) L'UE reproche à l'entreprise californienne d'avoir exploité des données publicitaires pour avantager ses propres services, faussant ainsi les règles du marché européen. La Commission européenne a condamné Meta à une amende historique de 798 millions d'euros pour des pratiques jugées anticoncurrentielles. En liant Facebook Marketplace à son réseau social, le géant américain aurait abusé de sa position dominante, faussant ainsi la concurrence. Retour sur les faits et les réactions. Une sanction record pour abus de position dominante Ce jeudi, la Commission européenne a annoncé une amende de 798 millions d'euros infligée à Meta, la maison mère de Facebook, Instagram et WhatsApp. La sanction découle d'une enquête formelle ouverte en juin 2021, portant sur des pratiques jugées abusives concernant le service Facebook Marketplace. Ce dernier, intégré directement au réseau social Facebook, aurait conféré à Meta un avantage injuste sur le marché des petites annonces en ligne. Selon Bruxelles, Meta a enfreint les règles européennes en liant Facebook Marketplace à son réseau social, exposant automatiquement ses utilisateurs à ce service, qu'ils le souhaitent ou non. Margrethe Vestager, commissaire européenne à la Concurrence, a déclaré dans un communiqué : \"Tous les utilisateurs de Facebook ont automatiquement accès à Facebook Marketplace et y sont régulièrement exposés, qu'ils le souhaitent ou non. Les concurrents risquaient d'être évincés, étant donné que le lien confère à Facebook Marketplace un avantage substantiel en matière de distribution que les concurrents ne peuvent égaler\", citée par [Le Figaro](https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/meta-ecope-d-une-importante-amende-de-798-millions-d-euros-de-l-ue-pour-pratiques-anticoncurrentielles-20241114). La Commission accuse également Meta d'imposer des conditions commerciales déloyales à ses concurrents. Ces derniers, contraints de diffuser leurs publicités sur les plateformes Facebook et Instagram, se retrouvent en désavantage, car Meta exploiterait ces données à son propre bénéfice. Meta a réfuté ces accusations dans un communiqué relayé par [Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/high-tech/facebook/concurrence-lue-inflige-une-amende-de-798-millions-deuros-a-meta-la-maison-mere-de-facebook-b3d76fc2-a2a9-11ef-b119-2c8e787cc364), affirmant que \"cette décision ignore les réalités du marché européen florissant des services de petites annonces en ligne et protège les grandes entreprises établies de l'arrivée d'un nouveau concurrent\". Des antécédents de sanctions pour les géants de la tech L'amende imposée à Meta est la septième plus importante jamais prononcée par la Commission européenne pour pratiques anticoncurrentielles, hors affaires de cartels, selon [Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr/high-tech/concurrence-deloyale-lue-inflige-une-amende-de-798-millions-deuros-a-meta-maison-mere-de-facebook-14-11-2024-A5TAJSM3JBHVRKSHC2JZCZD5HU.php). Ce palmarès est dominé par Google, qui a accumulé plus de 8 milliards d'euros de sanctions pour diverses infractions aux règles de concurrence, notamment en utilisant son système Android pour renforcer sa position dominante. Cette sanction s'ajoute également à une série de mesures prises contre Meta. Depuis 2022, l'entreprise a été condamnée pour des infractions au Règlement général sur la protection des données (RGPD) et au Digital Markets Act (DMA). Parmi les mesures de conformité mises en place, Meta a proposé des abonnements sans publicité pour les utilisateurs européens, afin de répondre aux exigences réglementaires. Margrethe Vestager a insisté sur l'importance de ces décisions pour garantir une concurrence équitable : \"Cette pratique est illégale. Meta doit à présent mettre un terme à ce comportement\", a-t-elle déclaré. La Commission estime que de telles sanctions sont nécessaires pour prévenir les abus des grandes plateformes numériques. Une bataille judiciaire en perspective Meta a annoncé son intention de faire appel devant le tribunal de l'Union européenne, une procédure qui pourrait durer plusieurs années. Toutefois, cette démarche ne suspend pas l'obligation de payer l'amende. Le groupe a également souligné dans son communiqué que \"les utilisateurs de Facebook peuvent choisir d'utiliser ou non Marketplace et beaucoup ne le font pas\", minimisant l'impact de ses pratiques sur le marché. Les principaux concurrents de Facebook Marketplace, comme Leboncoin ou eBay, restent leaders dans plusieurs marchés européens. Meta a utilisé ces exemples d'après [Les Numériques](https://www.lesnumeriques.com/societe-numerique/la-commission-europeenne-sanctionne-meta-d-une-amende-record-de-presque-800-millions-d-euros-n228838.html), pour affirmer que sa plateforme n'a pas nui à la concurrence, citant leur croissance continue dans de nombreux pays membres de l'UE. Cette affaire s'inscrit dans une tendance plus large de régulation accrue des grandes entreprises technologiques par l'Union européenne, qui cherche à limiter les abus de position dominante et à encadrer l'utilisation des données personnelles à des fins commerciales.",
