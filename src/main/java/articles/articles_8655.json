    "text": "During wartime, cultural figures are crucial as they narrate the story of Ukraine, preserve the memory of everything the Ukrainian people endure, reviving what gives people strength. This was emphasized by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his speech at the ceremony of the Taras Shevchenko National Prize 2024.\n\"In times of war – even more so than in times of peace – we must all remember the significance of culture. And people of culture matter. Everyone who speaks out for Ukraine. Who voices what's on their hearts. Who preserves everything we go through. Who revives what could have been forgotten but, renewed, gives people strength, gives emotions,\" said the President.\nThe Head of State said that Ukrainians have come a long way to become a nation, creators of their culture, state, and destiny.\n\"For a human community to become a nation and a state, the best characters in the country must have hearts that do not live only for themselves. Such hearts speak to those around them. They care. They teach – teach to understand. They unite. Protect. Save when necessary. And in the end, we all recognize each other, feel each other, feel that we are Ukrainians,\" said the Head of State.\nAccording to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this became possible not only thanks to the strength of our weapons but also to the strength of our people's hearts.\n\"In Mariupol, during the most terrifying days, there are those who understand: what they see, they must capture, preserve to later tell the whole world about it. Whether it's a person who doesn't want human memory to lose what was seen somewhere along the road to Bahmut or experienced in temporarily occupied Skadovsk. And who feels: they must record this, rhyme this moment, rhyme this pain. Or an artist who believes that the people of Ukraine, killed in this war, will be preserved in the emotions of those who are alive. And who speaks about it through their music. So that every living person in Ukraine remembers what this land is about, what its people are about, what thoughts the mother has, who is waiting for her son or daughter here, in Ukraine,\" said the President.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude to everyone who lives not only for themselves but also cares for people and the entire Ukrainian state.\n\"I thank you, I thank everyone who is now on the front lines and who is with those who are on the front lines. Those who are with Ukraine and cherish and develop it,\" said the Head of State.",

    "title": "Mississippi Supreme Court denies Lincoln County child abuse investigation appeal",
    "text": "On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued a ruling in a case of reported abuse of a student by school staff. The ruling denied an appeal from Lincoln County resident Felissa Jones against a court finding that Child Protection Services had no duty to investigate her accusations of abuse at a school.\nThe case originated in the Lincoln County School District, and was filed in Hinds County Chancery Court by Jones vs. Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services.\nIn 2019, Jones reported to CPS that her son had suffered abuse and neglect by staff at his LCSD elementary school. CPS responded that it does not investigate reports of abuse at school. Jones then sued the agency in July 2020, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief related the CPS’s intake policy that it does not investigate allegations of abuse in out-of-home settings, such as schools.\nAfter July 2020, CPS amended the policy to specify that it does not investigate these allegations if the alleged perpetrator “is not the parent, guardian, custodian, person responsible for the child’s care or support, or an adult relative or household member with access to the child”; Jones amended her suit based on the updated policy.\nJones’ argument was that Mississippi law mandates CPS investigate the report that her son had been abused and neglected at school. She alleged that by refusing to investigate, CPS deprived her son of the youth court’s jurisdiction. The suit sought declaratory relief that both the former and current policies violated the law, and injunctive relief ordering a change to CPS’s intake policy and ordering the agency to investigate any abuse complaints screened out due to the policies.\nThe Chancery Court denied a motion from Jones for judgment. When the Supreme Court denied her petition for an appeal, Jones asked the Chancery Court to reconsider the denial. While that motion was pending, CPS moved for a judgment. The Chancellor denied the motion for reconsideration, granted CPS’s motion, and dismissed Jones’ complaint.\nJones appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the denials and the grant of a motion for judgment to CPS.\n“In her brief, Jones splits her argument into multiple issues. But her appeal really only raises one question,” Justice ___ Maxwell wrote in the higher court’s ruling. “[D]oes MDCPS have a statutory duty to investigate abuse allegations in out-of-home settings such as schools and daycare? The answer hinges on statutory interpretation. … [After] review, we agree with the chancellor’s interpretation of the relevant youth court statutes.”\n“… while a school’s environment is extremely important to our children, who spend a significant amount of their time in the temporary care of teachers, school staff, and administrators, the youth court statutes do not equate a child’s school with a child’s home. And the statutes do not treat teachers as surrogate parents or custodians,” the ruling states. “Instead, the Legislature has made a clear delineation between reports of abuse and neglect by a parent, custodian, or other similarly situated adult — which fall under the youth court’s limited jurisdiction — and reports of abuse and neglect in out-of-home settings, such as schools — which do not.”\nTherefore, the Court ruled, CPS has no duty to investigate reports of abuse in those settings. “We thus affirm,” the ruling states. Justices Coleman, Beam, Chamberlin, Ishee and Griffis concurred. Justice Randolph concurred in result only, but did not offer a written opinion.\nJustice",

    "text": "The Brief The Diocese of Joliet announced it will close four of its churches later this year. The closures are the latest step in the diocese's process of \"targeted restructuring.\" Several other parishes will amalgamate, or essentially combine, later this summer as well. CREST HILL, Ill. - The Diocese of Joliet announced it will close four of its churches and essentially combine several others as a part of its \"targeted restructuring\" amid declining mass attendance and donations.\nBishop Ronald Hicks made the announcement last week which came as a result of months of work by a committee of clergy and laypeople to determine how the diocese should restructure.\nThe Diocese of Joliet was established in 1948 and serves more than 500,000 Catholics across DuPage, Kankakee, Will, Grundy, Ford, Iroquois, and Kendall counties. The data is accurate as of 2021, according to the diocese website.\nChurch closures this summer What we know:\nFour parishes in DuPage , Grundy and Will counties will close effective July 1, Hicks said.\nOne chapel will also close.\nThey include:\nSt. Mary in Park Forest St. Patrick (Wilton Center) in Manhattan St. Luke in Carol Stream St. John the Apostle in Villa Park St. Lawrence O’Toole Chapel in Essex These closure announcements are part of the third phase of the diocese’s restructuring process, which began last year. Diocese officials underwent an 11-month \"listening, review and discussion process,\" Hicks said.\nThe committee made recommendations to Hicks for his approval.\nMultiple parishes will amalgamate, or one parish will join an existing parish. Two parishes, St. Paul the Apostle in Peotone and Christ the Servant in Woodridge, will continue to operate as independent parishes.\nThese changes will also take effect on July 1.\n\"While I'm confident we are doing the right things and making sound decisions to make our diocese and our church stronger and able to thrive, I also appreciate and understand that if these outcomes directly affect you, or where you may worship, these actions may be difficult changes for you,\" Hicks said. \"And cause great hurt, sadness, and grieving.\"\nPrevious efforts to close other parishes have been met with pushback from church members.\nThe bishop discussed the announcements at length in a video posted to the Diocese of Joliet YouTube channel.\n‘Pruning’ of the diocese The backstory:\nThe closures are just the latest step in a process that began in 2021 to \"prune\" the diocese, a reference to a passage from the Gospel of St. John when Jesus tells his disciples that branches must be pruned from the vine to bear more fruit.\nThe diocese explained on its website that, like other Catholic diocese across the U.S., the process of consolidating and downsizing came about due to an aging priest population and a decline in Mass attendance and donations.\nThe population of those identifying as Catholic has been on the decline for years and more people are identifying as \"nones,\" or those claiming no religious affiliation.\nThe diocese also cited increased costs for building maintenance at its aging churches and schools. Catholic school enrollment is also on the decline, made worse by a nationwide teacher shortage.\nFor more information on the diocese's restructuring process, visit diojoliet.org .\nThe Source The information in this story was provided by the Diocese of Joliet.",

I might actually make it through this wave of omicron, thanks to this list.\nSo without further ado, let’s go through some of my favorite snowplow names (in no particular order), and have a good laugh, shall we?\nBig Bertha Look, you just want to meet the person who drives a snowplow named Big Bertha. You don’t mess with them.\nSaltosaurus Rex Our first pun! There is also a Plowasaurus Rex on the mega list of names, but we’ve got to give it to Saltosaurus Rex. No snow is safe when this plow is around.\nSnowdown Please, I’m Plowing It’s a pun, but it’s also not a name pun, so this makes it even better. And the driver of this plow is correct: You should slow down while they’re plowing!\nBaby Snowda This is the first (of many) “Star Wars” puns, which has me thinking that people who drive snowplows are just giant nerds? We say that with love!\nFast and Flurryous OK, I adore this one. Not only is it a great pun, but they used the word “flurry” when most of the puns we see involve “plow” or “salt.”\nBravo!\nSleetwood Mac OMG, the joy this name brought me when I first saw it.\nAgain, “sleet” is a word we don’t see used for puns on this list, so hats off for the creativity. And who doesn’t love Fleetwood Mac?\nBringin’ Pavement Back Besides this being a play on “SexyBack” by Justin Timberlake, this is literally what a snowplow does. This name is entertaining and informative.\nAlice Scooper This is an A+ pun and this person also gets bonus point because Alice Cooper is from Michigan. It’s a win-win.\nHan Snow-Lo This continues our trend of many “Star Wars” puns. Like I said, I think these snowplow drivers are just huge nerds, and I am here for it.\nSnowbegone Kenobi OK, but this one is the best of the “Star Wars” names. I applaud you.\nOrange Yooper Storm Trooper Not really a pun, but I do appreciate a good rhyme!\nStill Shorts Weather We all know that guy who wears shorts in the middle of winter on the one day when the sun’s out and the temp is just about 40 degrees.\nThis snowplow is an ode to that dude.\nBetty Whiteout Too soon? Nah, I think it’s a loving tribute.\nLive on, Betty!\nCtrl Salt Delete I have no words. This is genius.\nPlowthagorean Theorem OK, you can all go home now. This one wins.\nAlso, more nerds driving snowplows.\nSalt Whitman The inner English major in me is smiling so hard at this name.\nMy heart burst with the intensity of 1,000 suns.\nEdgar Allan Snow Again, God bless the people who come up with these names.\nMelton John I’m done.\nSnowprah Winfrey THIS ONE WINS, GOOD-BYE.\nGraham Media Group 2022",
