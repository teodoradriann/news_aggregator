    "title": "Wall Street Journal: 2 big victories for liberty at the Supreme Court",
    "text": "It was a good day, make that a great day, for liberty and the Constitution at the Supreme Court recently. The justices delivered an overdue rebuke to overreaching regulators in a ruling that abolishes\nChevron deference, while they also reined in prosecutors who stretched the law in pursuit of Jan. 6 cases.\nIn arguably the most significant decision of the year, a 6-3 majority (Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo) overturned the court’s 40-year-old Chevron doctrine that told judges to defer to agency interpretations of vague laws as long as they are “reasonable.” Now regulators will have a harder time bending laws, and Congress will have to legislate more clearly. Imagine that.\nChevron arose when judges were willy-nilly legislating from the bench, but its flaws were “apparent from the start,” as Chief Justice John Roberts explains for the majority. The doctrine lacked a constitutional basis and clashed with the Administrative Procedure Act’s command that courts “decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions.” From the start,\nhe says, Chevron was “a ‘rule in search of a justification,’ if it was ever coherent enough to be called a rule at all.”\nPeople are also reading…\nThe doctrine spawned confusion and conflict in lower courts, including whether a given law was ambiguous in the first place. As Justice Antonin Scalia put it five years after Chevron was decided: “How clear is clear?” The chief says deference to regulators became “an impediment, rather than an aid, to accomplishing the basic judicial task.”\nThe high court hasn’t invoked Chevron since 2016, relying instead on basic statutory interpretive tools and its major questions doctrine, such as in West Virginia v. EPA. “At this point, all that remains of Chevron is a decaying husk with bold pretensions,” the chief writes.\nThe problem is that lower courts still rely on Chevron and cite it repeatedly to rubber stamp even the most dubious rules. See the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe court’s considerations about when to revere precedents also support its decision. Not only has Chevron proven unworkable, it “has undermined the very ‘rule of law’; values that stare decisis exists to secure,” the chief stresses. As Justice Neil Gorsuch notes in a powerful concurrence, “these antireliance harms” aren’t “distributed equally.” While “sophisticated entities and their lawyers may be able to keep pace with rule changes affecting their rights and responsibilities,” others may not.\nChevron “has led us to a strange place. One where authorities long thought reserved for Article III are transferred to Article II, where the scales of justice are tilted systematically in favor of the most powerful, where legal demands can change with every election even though the laws do not, and where the people are left to guess about their legal rights and responsibilities.”\nLacking a strong legal rebuttal, the three liberal justices fret about “judicial hubris” and the court turning “itself into the country’s administrative czar.” “The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power,” Justice Elena Kagan writes in dissent. “Judges are not experts in the field.”\nBut the progressive impulse to defer to the rule of experts is one reason Americans are so frustrated with government. Some judges may run off the rails, but then some do that now. The crucial constitutional point is that each branch of government stays in its proper lane. ...\nIn Fischer v. United States, prosecutors charged a Jan. 6 rioter with violating the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, of all unlikely statutes.\nThe financial securities law makes it a crime to “corruptly” shred or conceal documents “with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.” This provision is followed by another one punishing anyone who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes” such a proceeding.\nThe government argued this catchall applied to the rioter’s obstruction. Six justices disagreed. The catchall “was designed by Congress to capture other forms of evidence and other means of impairing its integrity or availability,”\nthe chief writes. He was joined by Justices Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nIt would be “peculiar to conclude that in closing the Enron gap, Congress created a catch-all provision that reaches beyond the scenarios that prompted the legislation,” the chief adds. The government’s “novel interpretation would criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists alike to decades in prison.”\nThe court’s decisions safeguard individual liberty against overreaching government. Isn’t that why the Founders fought the Revolution?",

Il ‘duo’ nato con le Olimpiadi compie l’impresa a New York di GABRIELE TASSI - 5 settembre 2024 Sara Errani e Andrea Vavassori con il trofeo degli Us Open\nFacebook\nX\nWhatsApp\nPrint\nNew York, 5 settembre 2024 – Sorrisi quando l’altro sbaglia, testatine amichevoli e urli d’esultanza dritti in faccia. Sara Errani e Andrea Vavassori alzano, anzi baciano, la coppa degli Us Open , ridefinendo il concetto di complicità.\nLa coppia partita da Wimbledon con l’idea di assaltare le Olimpiadi riscrive invece la storia Slam del doppio misto azzurro. Nessuno come loro, nell’anno in cui i più bei record dell’Italtennis si sono sgretolati.\nSi giocava pure contro il campo, con il pubblico americano a sostenere Donald Young (ultima partita prima del ritiro per dedicarsi al Pickleball) e Taylor Townsend , regolati 7-6, 7-5.\nMa dietro cosa c’è? Tecnica? Tattica? Forse solo questione di chimica , anche se da sempre Sara – almeno nel doppio – un’abbonata Slam (questo è il suo 11°, è l’italiana più titolata nei Major), Wave si toglie finalmente la soddisfazione di un Major, sfiorato già tre volte in questa stagione. I due hanno più volte detto di trovarsi benissimo assieme, si sono allenati con il sorriso sulle labbra per conquistare lo Slam della leggerezza, in fondo “perché non provarci”.\nUn momento che finisce dritto dritto fra quelli speciali per Sarita, nel doppio da sempre abituata ai grandi palcoscenici: “Condividerlo con Andrea è bellissimo per me - commenta la romagnola -. Quest'anno per me è stato incredibile\".\nVavassori invece è alla sua prima grande gioia, dopo aver mancato di un soffio Australian Open e Roland Garros con Simone Bolelli: \"E' un sogno diventato realtà per me e ci sono riuscito con Sara, che è una giocatrice e una donna straordinaria\".\nLui il cannoniere, lei la formichina con il gioco capace di ossidare gli avversari colpo dopo colpo: hanno trovato la vittoria contro gli americani dal braccio veloce. Una storia appena cominciata e già così dolce.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nContinua a leggere tutte le notizie di sport su",

    "title": "Fuerte enfrentamiento entre Ayuso y Bergerot en la Asamblea por las investigaciones que involucran a la pareja de la presidenta",
    "text": "La sesión de control de este jueves en la Asamblea de Madrid estuvo marcada por un tenso enfrentamiento entre la presidenta del gobierno regional, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, y la portavoz de Más Madrid, Manuela Bergerot, a raíz de las investigaciones judiciales que salpican a la pareja de Ayuso, Alberto González Amador. Un cruce de acusaciones que se produjo luego de que algunos medios de comunicación adelantaran que González Amador intentó desgravarse gastos correspondientes a sus vacaciones con la presidenta.\nLa disputa comenzó con la intervención de Bergerot, quien realizó una advertencia directa a la presidenta popular: “Su novio irá pa’lante y se sabrá toda la verdad”. Una frase que claramente hace referencia a la investigación del Juzgado de Instrucción número 19 de Madrid, en la que se señala que González Amador podría haber utilizado una sociedad instrumental para ocultar parte de sus ingresos. A este respecto, la portavoz de Más Madrid ironizó con que el novio de Ayuso “no va a la Puerta del Sol a hacer negocios, él tiene la Puerta del Sol en casa”, remarcando la cercanía del empresario al poder político.\nEn la misma línea, Bergerot detalló con tono crítico que González Amador intentó deducir gastos personales, mientras acusaba a la presidenta madrileña de vivir en un piso “pagado con fraude fiscal” y de utilizar fondos públicos para acceder a la sala VIP del aeropuerto de Barajas en sus viajes privados. “El Rolex y el hilo dental, el saxofón y el desodorante, los gastos más suntuosos y los más insignificantes, todos les sirven para eludir a Hacienda”, afirmó la líder de Más Madrid, subrayando las supuestas irregularidades fiscales dentro del entorno personal de la presidenta.\nAnte las acusaciones de Bergerot, Ayuso defendió a su pareja, calificando la situación como un “ataque desmedido” orquestado por el Gobierno central para desprestigiar a un “ciudadano particular”. En este sentido, la presidenta regional aseguró que la investigación carece de base legal y que el expediente ha sido “troceado de manera fraudulenta” para perjudicar su imagen política. “Lo preocupante es que todo lo que me están contando no procede de una causa penal o de una multa de Hacienda, sino de un troceo de un expediente de manera fraudulenta para desguazar el prestigio de una persona por tener una relación sentimental con un político”, declaró Ayuso, tachando la estrategia de “estalinista” y contraria a los principios democráticos.\nMás allá de defender a su pareja, Ayuso también saltó en defensa de su propia integridad, negando haber utilizado fondos públicos para sus viajes. “Yo sí que puedo estar muy tranquila. A mí nadie me paga un duro en ninguno de mis viajes”, afirmó, añadiendo que cualquier ciudadano que haya compartido con ella podría confirmar que se comporta como “un ciudadano más”. En este sentido, la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid explicó que la Dirección General de Policía le proporciona acceso a la sala VIP del aeropuerto por motivos de seguridad, al igual que ocurre con otras altas autoridades, como los ministros y sus familias.\nAsimismo, mostrando confianza en que la Justicia esclarecerá los hechos, Ayuso aseguró que “el tiempo pone todo en su sitio”, y señaló que las acusaciones en su contra solo buscan desviar la atención de la “montaña de corrupción” que afecta al Gobierno central. Una montaña de corrupción que, según la presidenta, “es tan grande que, créanme, un hilo dental no lo va a tapar”.\nEn un tono más directo, la líder popular amplió sus críticas al Gobierno al señalar que “Hacienda debería, al menos, pedir las inspecciones fiscales de Koldo y de Ábalos”, sugiriendo que el Gobierno aplica un doble rasero en sus investigaciones. “A ellos se les regula, se silencia todo. Pero vamos a intentar volver con el novio de Ayuso, que tenemos mucho que tapar: lingotes, siete ministerios implicados, tramas millonarias”, enumeró la presidenta madrileña.\nDel mismo modo, Ayuso acusó al Gobierno de filtrar información para atacar a su entorno personal, insinuando que las filtraciones podrían venir directamente de la vicepresidenta y ministra de Hacienda, María Jesús Montero, quien recientemente declaró ante los medios que “en los próximos días habrá más información que les escandalizará”. Unas palabras que para Ayuso no solo confirman las filtraciones de Montero, sino que además demuestran que son parte de una estrategia deliberada por parte del Gobierno.\nDe modo que Ayuso cerró su intervención defendiendo su gestión y advirtiendo que las filtraciones que afectan a su pareja podrían acarrear problemas judiciales para quienes las promueven. “Eso es lo que va a hacer que otros, insisto, tengan problemas judiciales de aquí hacia adelante. Porque mientras exista un Estado de Derecho y unas garantías democráticas, eso es ilegal”, sentenció la presidenta.\nGonzález Amador responde a Bergerot con una demanda Las acusaciones de Bergerot hacia la pareja de Ayuso no solo provocaron una fuerte reacción por parte de la presidenta, sino que también llevaron a González Amador a interponer una demanda contra la portavoz de Más Madrid. Hoy jueves, el empresario presentó una querella en la que reclama a Bergerot una compensación de 20.000 euros por haberlo llamado “delincuente” en un programa de Telemadrid y en un post de X, publicado el pasado miércoles 23 de octubre.\nEn la demanda, González Amador exige que Bergerot se retracte públicamente y elimine la publicación de X en la que escribió: “El novio de la presidenta es un delincuente, él mismo lo ha confesado”. Adicionalmente, el demandante solicita a la portavoz de Más Madrid que publique una rectificación en sus redes sociales y advierte que tomará nuevas medidas legales si persisten las declaraciones difamatorias, añadiendo un nuevo grado de complejidad a un conflicto que ya trascendió lo meramente político.\nAnte la noticia de la demanda interpuesta por González Amador, Bergerot respondió en sus redes sociales, tildando el recurso legal como un intento para silenciarla. “Acabo de recibir una querella del novio de Ayuso y pretende pedirme 20.000 euros. Una querella para intentar silenciarnos, para que no digamos lo que sabe ya toda España. Señor Amador: ya tiene mucha tarea en los juzgados como para andarse querellando. Ojo con Quirón”, publicó la líder de Más Madrid .\nAcabo de recibir una querella del novio de Ayuso y pretende pedirme 20.000 euros. Una querella para intentar silenciarnos, para que no digamos lo que sabe ya toda España.\nSeñor Amador: ya tiene mucha tarea en los juzgados como para andarse querellando. Ojo con Quirón.\n— Manuela Bergerot (@manuelabergerot) October 24, 2024 En definitiva, se trata de un enfrentamiento legal que no toma a nadie por sorpresa, pues más allá de afectar la reputación de los implicados, la querella es casi un símbolo de la compleja e intensa batalla política que rodea a la Comunidad de Madrid. De modo que, entre acusaciones de corrupción, evasión fiscal y filtraciones, todo sugiere que este conflicto continuará escalando tanto en los tribunales como en la arena política, mientras ambos lados luchan por imponer su versión de los hechos.\nAyuso arremete contra el fiscal general y acusa al Gobierno de Sánchez de “prácticas mafiosas”",

    "text": "In the latest market close, Emerson Electric ( EMR Quick Quote EMR - Free Report ) reached $126.39, with a +0.13% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.07%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.05%.\nShares of the maker of process controls systems, valves and analytical instruments have depreciated by 4.8% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Industrial Products sector's loss of 8.42% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 1.05%.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Emerson Electric will be of great interest to investors. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.28, signifying a 4.92% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $4.23 billion, indicating a 2.81% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $5.94 per share and a revenue of $18.17 billion, demonstrating changes of +8.2% and +3.86%, respectively, from the preceding year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Emerson Electric. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.19% lower. Emerson Electric is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Emerson Electric has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.26 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.96.\nInvestors should also note that EMR has a PEG ratio of 2.12 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Manufacturing - Electronics industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.09.\nThe Manufacturing - Electronics industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 78, putting it in the top 32% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.",

    "text": "Amazon enviará al espacio sus primeros satélites de internet\nEl lanzamiento será el próximo miércoles.\nPUBLICIDAD\nNueva York. El gigante tecnológico Amazon anunció este miércoles que enviará al espacio el próximo 9 de abril su primer lote de satélites de red de banda ancha, parte del proyecto Kuiper, que proporcionarán Internet de alta velocidad a “cualquier lugar del planeta”.\nLa misión, denominada KA-01 (una abreviación de Kuiper Atlas 1), se lanzará en un cohete de la empresa United Launch Alliance desde la Estación Espacial de Cabo Cañaveral, en Florida, según un comunicado de Amazon.\nA las 12:00 (hora del este) se desplegarán 27 satélites a una altitud de 450 kilómetros sobre la Tierra, que ofrecerán Internet de alta velocidad y baja latencia, lo que hará que se tarde menos tiempo en transferir los datos a través de la red, indica la información\nAmazon añadió que la iniciativa Kuiper incluirá en total más de 3,200 satélites avanzados en la órbita terrestre baja (a una altitud de 2,000 kilómetros o menos sobre la superficie de la Tierra).\nUna vez que todos los satélites se hayan separado del cohete, el equipo de Kuiper se hará cargo de su gestión desde su centro de operaciones en Redmon, Washington, aclaro la compañía.\n“Hemos realizado numerosas pruebas en tierra para preparar esta primera misión, pero hay cosas que solo se aprenden en el vuelo (...). Independientemente de cómo se desarrolle, este es solo el comienzo de nuestro viaje”, apuntó -en el comunicado- Rajeev Badyal, vicepresidente del proyecto Kuiper.\nSegún la empresa, los satélites de esta misión son “una mejora significativa” de dos satélites prototipo que probó durante su misión Protoflight en octubre de 2023, de manera que se ha mejorado el rendimiento de todos los sistemas a bordo, incluidos los procesadores y los paneles solares.\nLa compañía indicó que la página web de la misión ofrecerá información actualizada sobre el lanzamiento, además de una retransmisión en directo que comenzará aproximadamente 20 minutos antes del despegue.\nCon Kuiper, Amazon competirá con otras empresas como Starlink -propiedad de Elon Musk-, que cuenta con más de 7,000 satélites de banda ancha, así como OneWeb o la china SpaceSail.",

    "text": "Balonmano Los 'Hispanos' neutralizan a Chile para empezar el Mundial Europa Press - jueves, 16 de enero de 2025 31 España 22 Chile La selección española masculina vence con contundencia a la chilena y empeza sin sustos su andadura en el Grupo F de la Ronda Preliminar Los 'Hispanos' neutralizan a Chile para empezar el Mundial - Foto: Beate Oma Dahle La selección española masculina de balonmano ha ganado este jueves por un claro 31-22 a la chilena en su primer partido del Campeonato del Mundo, que se está celebrando en Dinamarca, Noruega y Croacia, y ha empezado sin sustos su andadura en el Grupo F de la Ronda Preliminar.En el Unity Arena de Oslo, los 'Hispanos' tuvieron la puesta de largo de sus jóvenes perlas, ésas en las que tanto confía ya Jordi Ribera para el relevo generacional de una selección laureada. Eso sí, el combinado de Chile se lo puso difícil en el inicio de este encuentro, agarrado a la efectividad de Erwin Feuchtmann en tiros de proximidad.También convirtió el propio Feuchtmann dos lanzamientos de 7 metros, ante un Sergey Hernández titular y con mayor protagonismo que Gonzalo Pérez de Vargas. Por parte española, Imanol Garciandia era quien mejor interpretaba los planes en ataque, con cortes por delante de ambos centrales chilenos, a veces definiendo él y otras asistiendo al pivote.Los 'Hispanos' neutralizan a Chile para empezar el Mundial - Foto: Beate Oma DahleEsteban Salinas se unió a los peligros de una Chile que aprovechó dos faltas en ataque cometidas por Agustín Casado, como demostraron Rodrigo Aedo al contragolpe para marcar desde el extremo izquierdo y luego Feuchtmann poniendo el 5-8, sin haber transcurrido siquiera 10 minutos.El guardameta Felipe García había contribuido a esa ventaja chilena con un 7 metros parado a Dani Fernández, instancia que repitió más tarde entre arreón y arreón España. Para esa reacción del equipo entrenado por Ribera, el nombre clave había sido Djordje Cikusa, cuya entrada en la cancha asentó la defensa y propulsó la remontada antes del descanso.Con Ian Tarrafeta y Carlos Álvarez como puñales en los costados y al contragolpe, los 'Hispanos' se fueron al intermedio con un 17-13 algo más esperable en la previa de este debut mundialista. Pero hacía falta refrendar esa teórica superioridad ante el conjunto sudamericano, lo que aderezó el arranque de la segunda mitad, con varias sustituciones.Los 'Hispanos' neutralizan a Chile para empezar el Mundial - Foto: Beate Oma DahleLa profundidad de banquillo en España fue un arma que supo exprimir Ribera, especialmente tapando huecos atrás cuando los laterales rivales se cruzaban y propiciando, con ello, muchas transiciones de las que Dani Fernández y Tarrafeta sacaron jugo. Tampoco desentonaron Jan Gurri y Carlos Álvarez mientras las rentas españolas crecían y crecían (26-18).Con tranquilidad en los compases finales, y pese a un 0-3 de parcial en contra después de un tanto de Aedo al contragolpe, España abrochó su primer triunfo en este Mundial reñido. El otro arquero chileno, Vicente González, tuvo cuatro intervenciones de mérito e impidió una distancia más grande en el electrónico del pabellón de la capital noruega. , , , , , , , ,",

    "text": "[Tech News](https://www.news9live.com/technology/tech-news)\nBeware! Fake AI Video Tools Target Windows And Mac Users To Steal Personal Data\nThis fake AI video generating tool can steal sensitive information such as passwords, login details, browsing history of Mozilla, Chrome and others on Windows and Mac devices. Here is how to keep yourself safe.\nWith the advancement of technology and AI these days, the popularity amongst netizens is also growing. However, the growing popularity is presenting an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit the excited users. If you are one of those who always be excited to try new AI tools to create images or videos, then you must know that fake AI video-generating tools are on the rise!\nAs per a Bleeping Computer report, the fake AI video generators, which promise to offer free and simple video creation with the help of AI, are tricking users into downloading malware on their Windows and macOS devices to steal personal and sensitive information such as passwords, browsing history, wallets, and more.\nHow Fake AI Tools Trick Users\nScammers are taking advantage of the opportunity of rising demand for AI tools. Hackers use fake websites that look like legitimate AI video generators, appearing ads and search results on social media and search results. Once a user clicks on the ad, it takes you to a website which looks professional and trustworthy with the help of familiar elements like cookie banners, making it hard to tell if they’re fake or real. But as soon as you click the Download button, the trouble begins!\nThe malicious app secretly installs malware on your device. For Windows, the file is called “Edit-ProAI-Setup-newest_release.exe,” and for macOS, it’s named “EditProAi_v.4.36.dmg,” the report suggested. This malware includes two types of information-stealers: Lumma Stealer for Windows and AMOS for macOS.\nOnce the malware is installed on your device, it can steal sensitive information without your knowledge. From login credentials, passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other history saved in browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge can be compromised. What do hackers do with this information? They gather it in a file and send it back to their server to further use it to steal money, break into other accounts, or sell it to other cybercriminals.\nWhat Should You Do?\nIf you’ve downloaded one of these fake AI tools, it’s important to act quickly. First, change the passwords for all your online accounts, especially for banking, email, and cryptocurrency sites. The malware could have stolen your login credentials, so assume your accounts are at risk. Another important thing that you need to do is to enable “multi-factor authentication (MFA)” on all accounts to add an extra layer of security.\nApart from this, it is also crucial to be safe in future from such scams or fake apps. Hence, it is important to keep these points in mind:\n- Before downloading anything, make sure that the website is legitimate while checking for its reviews, and details, and it has a secure connection such as HTTPS.\n- Do not download from third-party apps. Always stick to the trusted sources. Some random pop-up ads? NEVER download from them.\nClick for more latest [Tech news](https://www.news9live.com/technology/tech-news).
