    "text": "[The Director of the Center for \"Human Dignity\"](https://www.frc.org/biography/mary-szoch-director-of-the-center-for-human-dignity) (yeah) at Family Research Council, Mary Szoch, scraped the bottom of the barrel of lunacy trying to attack the use of IVF by families. On the [Washington Watch podcast](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-cruz-katie-britt-ivf-access-bill/) topic of \"Christians and IVF\" was discussed, and Szoch claimed a new law could allow Democrats to promote abortion services tied to Medicaid funding. To highlight their crazy ideas, the FRC claimed the IVF industry is predatory and peddling pornography to aid in conception which they claim is \"against God's will.\" MARY SZOCH (FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL): ...recognizing that the IVF industry preys upon women. There are all sorts of medical challenges that women face as the result of IVF, whether it's an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy or of preeclampsia or of multiple births, which brings with it a more challenging pregnancy. But those physical challenges brought on by IVF don't even speak to the emotional and mental toll that the process takes. And that is a burden that's carried by both the mother and the father. Pornography is an integral part of the IVF process. And the husband's use of pornography is typically how sperm is obtained. That's not good for a marriage. We know that pornography goes against what God tells us about the dignity of men and women and the marital act. And then we know that embryos, while some of them do result in a baby that is one day held by the mother and father, we know that an embryo is a human being from the moment that embryo is conceived. How do these types of hateful Christians know what God's will is for the marital act? Or for anything they disagree with in the real world? The FRC has been labeled a [hate group by the SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council) Szoch is a big supporter that an embryo is a human being, which, of course, is religious nonsense. If she wants to be consistent, she should make the case that a droplet of sperm is a person as well and jail every man that jerks off.",

    "text": "Ali Krieger, a two-time World Cup champion with the U.S. women’s national team, opened up about her divorce from her wife and former soccer teammate, Ashlyn Harris, in a recent magazine interview. Krieger and Harris divorced after four years of marriage back in September, according to Page Six. Harris reportedly wrote in court documents that their marriage was \\\"irretrievably broken\\\" as the two came to an agreement on financial issues and custody rights for their adopted children. She told Self Magazine she learned about the divorce filing while she was at practice during the 2023 season with Gotham FC of the National Women’s Soccer League.

And I will never forget that moment,\\\" Kreiger told the outlet. \\\"I found out at training. I was on the field. And I came off the field, in the locker room, and I was obviously devastated.\\\" Krieger said her teammates were at her house until about 2 a.m. ET on that day. \\\"Through these past five months, my friends have shown up in ways that I will cherish and remember forever,\\\" she said. \\\"They are my true people. It’s been so rewarding to see that, because you don’t know how much of an impact you have, even on your personal friends, and when they show up for you, you’re just like, 'Whoa — thank God.’\\\" As rumors sparked that Harris was unfaithful in their marriage, she denied it in a November statement. \\\"Several weeks ago, a process that had been ongoing privately for some time became public. Ending a relationship after almost 13 years of friendship, teammate-ship, marriage and coparenting (many of them good years) is a decision that was not made lightly,\\\" she said in part. \\\"We agreed to center our children, continue therapy, separate and to move forward with our lives.

Let me be clear: I did not step out on my marriage. I was always faithful in my marriage, if not always totally happy.\\\" Krieger and Harris wed in 2019 after initially keeping their marriage a secret. The two won both the 2015 and 2019 Women's World Cup titles together and have played professionally with each other since 2013 for four different teams, including a Swedish club. In 2020, the two admitted it was \\\"tricky\\\" being married as teammates. \\\"We don’t get really good time together. We have to make time even though we see each other all the time. It’s tricky,\\\" Harris said to Allure at the time, adding that they hardly even room together when playing.

    "text": "Solana is one the best altcoins in the crypto space as it has rallied over 600% from its December 2022 low. Did you miss out on Solana? Don't worry. Analysts have picked three coins that can give such massive gains in 2024. They are Bitcoin, Meme Moguls, and Stacks.\nAnalysts Forecast Bitcoin (BTC) Prices for 2024 Crypto Rover, a crypto analyst with over 615k followers on X, has hopped in on Bitcoin price prediction. The analyst noted that Bitcoin faces a major resistance at $44,300.\nIf Bitcoin price can surpass this resistance level, Crypto Rover noted that the coin would rise to $46,000. Also, another analyst, Michael Van de Poppe, has tagged Bitcoin ETF approval as a significant event for the flagship cryptocurrency.\nMeanwhile, Matrix Port has forecasted that the US SEC will greenlight Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. The crypto company stated that this would be a major rally, taking Bitcoin to $50,000 by February 2024.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has fluctuated between $40,766.45 and $44,155.79 in the past week. The bulls are currently gearing up to retest the $44,300 level. A breakout would spark a rally to $46,000.\nStacks (STX) Soars After Praises From Legendary Investor Tim Draper Stacks (STX), the native token of the Stacks Network, saw a 27% increase in value on Wednesday. This uptick followed a series of encouraging remarks from Tim Draper . Draper, while in an interview with CoinBureau, expressed his enthusiasm: \"I'm pretty excited about Stacks.\"\nMeanwhile, 2023 has seen a notable one for Stacks, especially with the launch of Bitcoin-based NFT projects like Ordinals. According to data from DeFiLlama, the amount of capital locked in Stacks has grown from $7 million to $50 million since the start of 2023.\nAlso, the Stacks price has increased 131.4% in the past months as it trades at the $1.4 region. Analysts have predicted a rise to $3 in 2024.\nWhy Meme Moguls (MGLS) Could Soar 50x in 2024 Besides Bitcoin and Stacks, analysts are also bullish on the blockchain ICO, Meme Moguls . Currently, Meme Moguls' tokens are valued at only $0.0025. Meanwhile, analysts have predicted a 50x price surge in 2024. Below are five reasons why Meme Moguls would soar in 2024:\nMeme Moguls stands out with its innovative features in the gaming and financial market:\nUnique Play-to-Earn Model: Meme Moguls introduces a play-to-earn concept where players can play games and earn real rewards. Analysts believe this approach could draw a broad audience interested in gaming and finance. Community-Driven Environment: The DeFi project focuses on community engagement. It provides a space for players to interact, compete, and grow together. Enhanced Gaming with NFTs: The platform's NFTs are more than collectibles. Their rarity and utility bring added value to the game's economy. Educational and Competitive Gameplay: The platform offers trading education beyond entertainment. The DeFi project hosts trading competitions, helping players develop their skills and strive to become top traders in the game. The MGLS token is the in-game currency and is a major part of this blockchain ICO. Players can use it to purchase assets and engage in game trading activities. Because of the uniqueness of the ecosystem, analysts have backed MGLS for a major surge in 2024.\nConclusion According to analysts, Bitcoin, Stacks, and Meme Moguls are among the best altcoins to give Solana-like price gains in 2024. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls is the cheapest of the three. It should be a top choice for investors looking for relatively cheap tokens with huge potential.\nLearn more about the $MGLS here:\nVisit Meme Moguls | Join the Community\nDisclaimer: This is a paid press release, BSC.News does not endorse and is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy, quality, advertising, products, or other materials on this page.
