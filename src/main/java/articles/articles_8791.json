    "text": "西藏作为我国重要的生态安全屏障，林草资源对于维护生态平衡、促进经济社会可持续高质量发展起着决定性作用。2025年西藏林草事业迎来关键节点。这一年，不仅是“十四五”规划收官与“十五五”规划布局之年，同时西藏自治区将迎来成立60周年，做好林草各项工作意义重大、影响深远。在第47个植树节之际，记者就2024年西藏林草工作完成情况和2025年西藏林草重点工作，采访了西藏自治区林草局党组成员、副局长、拉萨南北山绿化指挥部办公室副主任胡志广，深入了解林草系统如何积极作为，推动全区林草工作迈向高质量发展新阶段。\n关键之年\n林草工作使命重大\n近日，2025年全区林业和草原工作会议召开，会议指出，2024年，全区林草系统以林长制为抓手，科学开展以南北山绿化为代表的国土绿化行动，持续加大森林、草原、湿地、荒漠生态系统和生物多样性保护力度，积极构建以国家公园为主体的自然保护地体系，圆满地完成了各项目标任务；2025年全区林草系统要紧盯自治区党委、政府确定的各项目标任务，积极担当作为，勇于改革创新，不断强化林草资源保护管理，强化林草生态修复治理，科学开展以南北山绿化工程为重点的国土绿化，积极推进以国家公园为主体的自然保护地体系建设，持续深化以集体林权制度为重点的林业改革，积极探索以林草碳汇为抓手的生态价值转化机制，努力开创全区林草工作高质量发展新局面。\n“2025 年对于西藏林草事业而言，是具有里程碑意义的一年。多重关键时间节点叠加，赋予了我们更为艰巨的任务和使命。我们必须以更高的标准、更严的要求、更实的举措，全力推动林草工作，为西藏的生态环境改善和可持续发展奠定坚实生态基础。”胡志广说。\n西藏地处青藏高原，其独特的地理位置和生态系统，使其成为我国乃至全球生态安全的重要屏障。林草资源作为生态系统的核心组成部分，对于维护生物多样性、调节气候、保持水土等方面起着不可替代的作用。西藏林草事业的发展，不仅关系到自身生态环境的优化，更关乎国家生态安全大局。\n多措并举\n全面落实重点任务\n2025年，西藏林草工作在生态修复和资源保护方面任务艰巨且目标明确。胡志广介绍，稳步推进高原国土绿化是主要任务，今年西藏计划完成营造林100万亩、退化草原修复治理 500万亩，以南北山绿化工程为重点，通过科学设计与精细实施，增加林草植被覆盖度，改善区域生态环境。\n在林草资源保护上，多项工作同步推进。完成《西藏自治区实施〈中华人民共和国森林法〉实施办法》修订，为资源保护提供更完善的法律支撑；草原载畜量核定工作将科学合理确定草原承载能力，促进草原可持续利用；林芝国家植物园创建工作的进一步推动，将助力生物多样性保护与科研科普。\n同时，积极开展森林草原湿地荒漠化普查与年度综合监测工作，全面掌握林草资源动态变化。“扎实推进林草碳汇工作也是今年的重点。”胡志广说，“通过开展自治区林草碳汇开发交易试点，研究建立标准体系，探索生态价值转化新路径。此外，我们还将全力支持国家、自治区重大项目建设，提供‘事前、事中、事后’全过程服务，确保项目与生态保护协调发展。”\n深化改革是推动林草事业发展的动力源泉。2025年，西藏全面推行林长制改革，进一步探索“林长 +”协作机制。“建立‘林长 + 边境生态安全’等工作机制，能够有效整合各方力量。”胡志广说。\n集体林权制度改革也将持续深化，完成集体林权类不动产权确权登记，基本完成集体林权制度改革。这将明晰产权，激发林农和社会力量参与林业发展的积极性，释放林业发展活力；在国家公园建设方面，西藏将积极推动相关工作，超常规推进雅鲁藏布大峡谷国家公园创建设立，并继续做好羌塘、珠峰等国家公园的创建设立。\n强化保障\n护航林草事业发展\n林草资源安全是林草事业发展的根基。胡志广表示，要强化林草防火能力提升，深入高效开展风险隐患排查，还要通过完善防火基础设施、加强防火队伍建设与应急演练，确保全区森林草原防火形势平稳。同时，要抓好林业有害生物防控，运用科学监测与防控手段，保障全区森林资源健康安全。\n加强林草资金项目全流程管理同样关键。严格按照国家林草局要求，扎实推进西藏林草资金项目全流程管理工作。从项目申报、实施到验收，进行全方位监管，确保资金使用合理、项目实施高效，发挥最大的生态、经济和社会效益。\n做好林草项目有序衔接，也是推动林草事业持续发展的重要保障。2025 年，西藏将全力推动“十四五”林草项目收官工作，确保正在实施项目年底前全部完工。同时，高质量启动“十五五”项目谋划工作。\n“我们要做好林草项目谋划储备、审核审批、申报入库工作。”胡志广强调，“要以科学规划引领项目建设，结合西藏生态需求与发展战略，谋划一批高质量、可持续的林草项目，为未来五年林草事业发展奠定坚实基础，开创林草工作高质量发展新局面，为西藏的长远发展奠定坚实生态基础。”\n稳步推进\n国土绿化添新绿\n“你看那边，再看那边，现在都绿了。”拉萨市南山公园安全负责人、护林员扎西曲培手指着南山自豪地说道，2012年他拍了一张照片，这儿只是一片荒山，满地都是石头，现在绿树满山，而且公园里的油松、白皮松、侧柏等树种已经繁衍出了“树二代。”。\n在南山公园，记者看到工人们正忙着给树浇水。南山公园安保人员扎西次旺告诉记者：“虽然我是负责安保工作的，但是我不忙的时候也会去给树浇水，因为这里的每一棵树、每一株草对于我们而言都有非常大的意义。通过大家的努力，我相信我的家乡会变得越来越绿，生态环境也会越来越好。”\n现在的南山公园，各种树木错落有致，小桥下流水潺潺，市民游客热衷于来此打卡，峰值期日入园量2万余人，一张张“拿捏南山”的打卡照频频亮相朋友圈，成了绿色奇迹最好的见证。\n拉萨南北山绿化工程作为西藏首个规模化山体造林的重大生态修复工程，也是增进各族群众生态福祉的重要民生工程。该工程涉及拉萨市城关区、堆龙德庆区、达孜区、柳梧新区、曲水县、墨竹工卡县、林周县及山南市浪卡子县、贡嘎县等9个县（区）35个乡（镇），于2021年正式启动，计划用十年时间完成国土绿化面积206.72万亩，实现“五年增绿山川，十年绿满拉萨”的构想。截至目前，完成造林面积70余万亩，栽植白榆、油松、江孜沙棘、绢毛蔷薇等各类苗木1.14亿株。\n胡志广表示，2025年，西藏林草系统会在多重使命下，以更加坚定的步伐推进各项工作，将通过生态修复、资源保护、深化改革、强化保障等多方面努力，筑牢生态屏障，开启西藏林草事业高质量发展新篇章，为建设美丽西藏贡献林草力量。\n版权声明：凡注明“来源：中国西藏网”或“中国西藏网文”的所有作品，版权归高原（北京）文化传播有限公司。任何媒体转载、摘编、引用，须注明来源中国西藏网和署著作者名，否则将追究相关法律责任。",

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link)\nLa joie des Sénégalais vainqueurs avec maîtrise du Cameroun à la CAN à Yamoussoukro, le 19 janvier 2024\nLe Sénégal a enfin battu le Cameroun (3-1) en Coupe d'Afrique, 34 ans après, pour se qualifier pour les 8e de finale, débarrassé de son vieux complexe face à son prestigieux adversaire, nettement dominé vendredi à Yamoussoukro.\nL'histoire a basculé. L'ouverture du score du Marseillais Ismaïla Sarr, qui a pu se retourner dans une défense apathique (16), symbolise ces courbes en train de se croiser entre les deux vieux rivaux. Au Sénégal le réalisme, au Cameroun le manque de hargne.\n\"On a été au-dessus en tous points, comme sur le match amical (gagné 1-0 en octobre)\", s'est réjoui le gardien Edouard Mendy.\nLe tenant du titre assume toujours bien son rôle de favori: il rejoint au tour suivant le Cap-Vert, qualifié un peu plus tôt en cartonnant le Mozambique (3-0) avec notamment un coup franc de 40 m de Bebé.\nLe Cameroun, tenu en échec par la Guinée (1-1) au premier match, est encore loin du deuxième tour et de son glorieux passé.\nA part un premier match de groupe gagné (2-0) en Algérie en 1990, les \"Lions de la Teranga\" avaient toujours fini en larmes face aux \"Indomptables\" du Cameroun.\nBattus chez eux à Dakar en quarts de finale en 1992 (1-0), en finale 2002 (0-0, 3-2 aux t.a.b.) et encore en quarts en 2017 (0-0, 5-4 aux t.a.b.), quand Sadio Mané avait raté sa tentative, les Sénégalais ont cette fois fait la loi, à l'image de leur capitaine Kalidou Koulibaly, solide comme un roc, vainqueur de nombreux duels avec les attaquants camerounais.\nA voir Lamine Camara demander à grands moulinets encore plus de bruits aux supporters sénégalais, on comprenait que le prometteur (20 ans) milieu de terrain, auteur d'un doublé au premier match contre la Gambie (3-0), vivait intensément la rivalité entre les deux Lions (16).\nLe défenseur camerounais Jean-Charles Castelletto (N.21) vient de réduire le score contre le Sénégal à Yamoussoukro, le 19 janvier 2024\nAprès les joutes verbales entre les sélectionneurs sénégalais Aliou Cissé et camerounais Rigobert Song, qui étaient tous les deux capitaines de la finale 2002, la plus belle affiche du premier tour n'a pas tenu ses promesses, faute de consistance des joueurs en vert.\nFranck Magri, replacé du côté droit à son vrai poste, avant-centre, n'a eu que des miettes. Et le gardien André Onana, autorisé à n'arriver que pour le second match, n'a rien pu faire.\n\"Il faut reconnaître que le Sénégal a été meilleur que nous\", s'est incliné le sélectionneur Rigobert Song.\nLe spectacle n'a été vraiment intense que vers la fin, dans un stade Konan-Banny plein, achevé de se remplir à la mi-temps par l'ouverture des portes aux spectateurs massés derrière les grilles.\nAprès le 2-0 signé Habib Diallo, reprenant un centre de Sarr (71), les Camerounais ont enfin réagi avec un but de la tête de Jean-Charles Castelletto (83).\nLes Sénégalais ont alors testé leur \"complexe camerounais\": ils n'allaient quand même pas se faire rejoindre par une équipe qu'ils avaient dominée!\nTest réussi: après une ultime frayeur sur une tête de Georges-Kevin Nkoudou (90+4), Mané a marqué le but du 3-1 (90+5). Les Lions du Sénégal ne remâcheront plus leur vieille revanche, ils l'ont prise.",
