    "text": "Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) Published July 05, 2024 | 05:30 PM\nISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Jul, 2024) Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited ( SNGPL ) has undertaken significant projects aimed at improving gas pressure in Rawalpindi and the Federal Capital, especially during the winter season.\nIn Islamabad , SNGPL has commissioned a new 24-inch diameter gas pipeline along Srinagar Highway to enhance gas pressure.\nShahid Akram, the spokesman for SNGPL , shared that the new pipeline spans 11 kilometers and was completed within six months. This project is one of the largest capacity-building initiatives executed by the gas distribution company in Islamabad .\nHe expressed optimism that this pipeline would resolve the low gas pressure issues faced by residents of Islamabad . The pipeline is expected to serve as a substantial gas source throughout the year, benefiting over 200,000 consumers in the capital city.\nIn Rawalpindi , SNGPL has added 14 kilometers of 18-inch diameter and 13 kilometers of 10-inch diameter pipelines to the system to address complaints about low gas pressure in the city. Shahid Akram said that with the completion of this project, consumers in Rawalpindi will no longer face issues of low gas pressure.",

    "title": "Donald Trump’s Veepstakes: “Rich Guys” and Loyalty Tests",
    "text": "Donald Trump —convicted felon, aspiring authoritarian, and the man the GOP is proud to once again run as their presidential contender—has spent months auditioning potential running mates, casting a wide net of strivers, cynics, and flunkies to decide who gets second billing in the Trump Show. Now, that process appears to have entered its final stages. ABC News reports that the former president’s team has made vetting requests to at least seven Republicans—a short list that may not represent all under review but seems to reflect his top choices. His considerations? “Trump likes people who are rich and have hot wives,” a source familiar with the vetting process told Politico.\nThe source was apparently referring there to Doug Burgum , the deep-pocketed governor of North Dakota who briefly mounted a primary campaign for president last year and, at the time, explicitly ruled out serving as Trump’s veep—“I would not,” he said —before dropping out of the race, endorsing Trump, and endearing himself to the former president as a key player in his fundraising operation. Loyalty—as always—is Trump’s chief concern. It’s important to him that his ticketmate follows his lead—and be willing to subvert democracy on his behalf.\nOhio Senator J.D. Vance , another leading contender, has emerged as one of Trump’s top sycophants—serving as a conduit between Trump and Silicon Valley and as one of his most aggressive attack dogs, particularly following the former president’s historic conviction, with Vance making the media rounds suggesting the hush-money verdict, rendered by a jury of 12 New Yorkers, was evidence that America is descending into “fascism” under Joe Biden . “Whatever happened to the Republican Party being the party of ‘law and order?’” CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Vance after the former president was found guilty on 34 felony counts last week. “Every single thing about this points to the fact that this was a political sham prosecution,” Vance shot back.\nIt is striking that the guy who once suggested Trump could be “America’s Hitler” is now defending Trump as he insists his conviction means America has become a “fascist state.” But if there’s anything Trump appreciates more than loyalty, it’s the kind of loyalty he extracts from vanquished former critics like Tim Scott and Marco Rubio —both of whom are reportedly on the shortlist. Scott ran a primary campaign against Trump this cycle, pledging to bridge America’s divisions before becoming the friendly face of Trump’s cruel political movement. Rubio had clashed even harder with Trump during the 2016 campaign, describing him as a “con artist” and making a pointed dig at Trump’s “small hands” during a memorably crude debate stage exchange. Now? He’d be “honored” to serve with Trump.\nScott and Rubio could, the theory goes, help Trump siphon enough voters from Biden to give him the edge in November. Polls suggest Biden could suffer weakened support from Black and Hispanic voting blocs—a significant vulnerability for a president who was lifted to victory in 2020 by voters of color. But Trump, who has thrown in his lot with white supremacists and claimed non-white immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country, has been profoundly grotesque in his outreach . Another potential Trump running mate, Byron Donalds, said that Black Americans were better off under Jim Crow than they are under Biden. “During Jim Crow, the Black family was together,” Donalds said at a Black outreach event featuring Trump surrogates in Philadelphia Wednesday. Donalds defended his remarks on CNN later that night, telling Abby Phillip that his comments had been misconstrued. “It sounds like nostalgia,” Phillip said. “I didn’t say that,”Donalds replied. “I didn’t even insinuate that.” While he is “obviously one of the better communicators in the Republican Party,” Donalds said, Democrats are “trying to twist my words.” Did he have anything to say on those running mate rumors? “I’m gonna leave that very private,” Donalds told Phillip. “They’re gonna go through their deliberations. President Trump’s gonna make a decision.”\nThose deliberations appear to be ongoing and also reportedly include former Trump administration official Ben Carson , extremist Senator Tom Cotton , and Representative Elise Stefanik , who has carved out a niche for herself recently in the campus culture wars. Seemingly left out of the vetting so far? MAGA firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene , who once seemed like an obvious contender for the supporting role but has since fallen out of favor somewhat , thanks to her thirst for the spotlight. There’s a lesson in there for those still in the mix: the MAGAverse still has but one star—and it’s not you.\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair Cover Star Ayo Edebiri Is Making Hollywood Her Playground\n23 Summer Movies You Can’t Miss This Year\nStormy Daniels’s Marriage Advice for Melania Trump\nExclusive: Inside America’s Secret Efforts to Free US Hostages\nWhy It Took Decades to Bring One Hundred Years of Solitude to the Screen\nGriffin Dunne on the Tragic Death That Reshaped His Family\nHamptonites Are Losing It Over the Congestion Pricing Program\nThe Vatican’s Secret Role in the Science of IVF\nWhat Is Cinema?

    "title": "女儿高考查分\"69\"开头，全家庆祝清北稳了，拿掉身份证后却傻眼|高考成绩_网易订阅",
    "text": "高考“查分季”，网上充斥着各种风格的查分视频， 有的家庭充满爱意，在查分前就帮孩子做好心理建设，在看到比预期更好的结果后相拥而泣；也有的父母虽然不曾多言，但看到女儿失落的情绪和委屈的眼泪后，第一时间选择的不是批评更是安慰和鼓励。\n当然也有比较传统的“中式父母”，在看到女儿的成绩没有想象中理想后， 父亲的黑脸、母亲的翻白眼、指责，以及女儿的脆弱和无助，这些都成了高考“查分季”的热搜话题 ，开明的父母人人羡慕，而那些中式父母的态度却格外真实。\n但有趣的是， 哪怕氛围既然不同，很多家庭查分的方式却很相似，都是用身份证、准考证或者书籍挡住屏幕，先遮住总分，再一点点的往右挪动， 直到看见整体的分数，这样的方式能让惊喜拉到最大，也能让发挥不佳的结果有一个心理上的缓冲，可谓是两全其美的查分方式。\n女儿高考查分“69”开头，本以为清北稳了，拿掉身份证却傻眼了\n湖南省一位女生也采用了这种查分方式，先将身份证放在电脑屏幕上，遮住总分，然后一点点揭晓结果。 当全家人看到总分的第一个数字是“6”的时候，激动的心情已经按耐不住了，在看到第二个数字是“9”的时候，更是彻底沸腾了。\n高考总分“69”开头，全家人已经彻底沉浸在庆祝的喜悦中，认为这波考上清北都稳了， 面对这份只揭晓了一半的成绩单，全家人已经提前陷入了巨大的喜悦之中，想当然的认为，女儿高考超常发挥了，语文、英语140+、武学130+、综合20+，迫不及待的准备看看总分的最后一位是数字几。\n可当身份证被拿掉之后，全家人都傻眼了，“69开头”的高考分数变成了“只有69”， 语文、数学、英语、综合的成绩最后一位数字也消失了，一家人的笑容彻底凝固在了脸上，全家人集体沉默了。\n原来，这位考生的总分只有69分，语文14分，数学13分，英语14分，综合成绩28分， 从欢天喜地到目瞪口呆，这种心情上的落差可想而知，这样一段特殊的查分视频被家长发到网上后，也的确成为了“一股清流”。\n网上的声音也是颇为精彩 ，有网友质疑：自己平时什么水平没数吗？ 瞎写都很难考这么低的分数，竟然还幻想超常发挥考上清华北大？这不是痴人说梦吗？\n但很快，有细心的网友发现了问题，这名家长在晒出女儿查分结果的时候，完全没给名字和考号做遮挡， 也就是说，考生的个人信息和成绩完全暴露了，在互联网时代，过度暴露个人信息从来都不是一件好事，没想到当父母的竟然这么粗心大意。\n面对高考查分，无论结果如何，我们都应该保持理性和尊重\n高考结束后，很多家长选择录制查分过程，希望记录下这个重要时刻，但在这个过程中，他们是否考虑过孩子的感受？如果成绩不理想， 这样的视频可能会成为孩子的心理负担，甚至在网络上流传，给孩子带来二次伤害。\n作为家长，哪怕平时再怎么忙碌，也不该只在高考这一天关注孩子的学习， 如果家长平时就密切关注孩子的学习进展，了解其真实水平，就不会在查分时出现如此巨大的落差，高考查分时的失望，根本上还是来源于不切实际的希望。\n高考成绩只是对学生十二年学习的一次总结性评价，而非对学生全部能力的评价。 如果一个学生平时成绩普通，突然在高考中考出优异成绩的可能性很小；同样，如果一个学生平时成绩出色，高考严重失常的可能性也不大。\n面对高考查分，无论结果如何，我们都应该保持理性和尊重。 每一个高考考生都付出了巨大的努力，高考只是人生的一个阶段，而不是全部。对于成绩优异的学生，给予恰当的鼓励和祝贺；对于成绩不理想的学生，给予理解和支持。同时，家长们还要注意：保护孩子们的信息，不要随意将他们的个人信息公之于众。\n今日话题：你如何看待这件事呢？\n（所有图片均来源于网络，如有侵权，请联系删除）",

    "text": "Quan arriba el bon temps, moltes persones busquen fórmules per aprofitar millor el balcó, la terrassa o aquell racó exterior que sovint queda desaprofitat. Si tens un espai reduït però no vols renunciar a l’estiu a l’aire lliure, aquest conjunt de jardí s’està convertint en una de les opcions més recomanables. És compacte, fàcil de moure i està pensat per resistir la pluja, el sol i l’ús habitual sense desgastar-se. Ara mateix, el pots trobar per 64,77 € amb un descompte del 12%.\nUn conjunt compacte amb un 12% de descompte que encaixa a tot arreu\nAquest conjunt de tres peces de la marca TecTake està format per dues cadires i una taula rodona, totes amb una estructura d’acer resistent i un disseny lleuger que facilita molt el transport i la col·locació. Tot plegat ocupa poc espai i es pot guardar o desmuntar fàcilment quan no s’utilitza, cosa que el fa especialment pràctic per a balcons petits o terrasses estretes.\nEl muntatge és senzill i intuïtiu, i un cop muntat es mostra estable gràcies als topalls de les potes, que eviten relliscades i protegeixen el terra. El color negre li dona un aspecte neutre i elegant que combina bé amb qualsevol estil decoratiu, des dels entorns més rústics fins als més moderns.\nResistència i comoditat pensades per al dia a dia\nTot i ser un model compacte i assequible, aquest set destaca per la qualitat dels materials. Les cadires estan fetes amb una tela de secatge ràpid, ideal per a climes variables o per a aquells dies en què una pluja sobtada pot sorprendre. A més, les fundes són suaus al tacte i no s’escalfen excessivament amb el sol.\nÉs ideal per a persones que volen aprofitar l’espai exterior sense fer grans despeses, o per a qui busca una solució fàcil de guardar quan s’acaba la temporada. També és perfecte per a segones residències, on es valora especialment la facilitat de transport i el manteniment mínim. Les nanses incorporades a les cadires permeten traslladar-les amb comoditat, i la lleugeresa del conjunt facilita que una sola persona el pugui moure o reubicar.\nAquest conjunt no falla quan es vol esmorzar, llegir o fer una copa al vespre a l’exterior, sense necessitat de tenir un jardí gran ni fer reformes.\nPer què ara és una bona oportunitat?\nAquest conjunt, que ja de per si té una relació qualitat-preu molt raonable, ara es pot adquirir per 64,77 €, amb una rebaixa del 12%. No és gaire habitual trobar mobiliari d’exterior resistent i funcional per aquest preu, i menys amb aquestes prestacions: estructura d’acer, teixit tècnic, topalls protectors i un disseny plegable i lleuger.\nSi estàs pensant a fer una petita renovació a la terrassa o el balcó abans que acabi l’estiu, és un bon moment per fer-ho. Aquest tipus d’ofertes solen durar poc, especialment durant els mesos de calor, quan la demanda de mobiliari exterior augmenta.\nAquest article pot incloure enllaços d’afiliació. Si compres a través d’ells, a ElNacional.cat podríem rebre una petita comissió. Això no afecta el preu que pagues ni condiciona la nostra opinió.",
