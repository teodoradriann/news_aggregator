    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "In the dynamic world of digital marketing,\nSEO link-building stands as a linchpin for improving a website's visibility, authority, and search engine rankings. At the forefront of this strategic endeavor is the SEO link builder, a professional tasked with the intricate process of acquiring valuable backlinks. In this article, we'll delve into the multifaceted role of an SEO link builder, shedding light on the strategies, challenges, and essential skills involved in this critical aspect of online marketing.\nThe Role of an SEO Link Builder:\nAn SEO link builder is essentially a digital architect, strategically constructing pathways that connect websites and signal to search engines the credibility and relevance of a particular site. The primary goal is to secure high-quality backlinks from reputable sources, enhancing a website's authority and influencing its positioning in search engine results.\nKey Responsibilities and Strategies of an SEO Link Builder:\n1. Content Strategy:\nThe foundation of successful\n link building is compelling content. An SEO link builder collaborates closely with content creators to develop materials that are not only informative and engaging but also inherently link-worthy. Quality content becomes the bait that attracts valuable backlinks.\n2. Guest Posting and Outreach:\nGuest posting remains a stalwart strategy for link builders. This involves identifying authoritative websites within the industry and reaching out to offer relevant and valuable content in exchange for backlinks. Effective outreach requires a balance of professionalism, personalization, and persistence.\n3. Broken Link Building:\nA proactive approach, broken link building involves identifying broken links on reputable websites and proposing your content as a replacement. This mutually beneficial strategy aids website owners in fixing broken links while securing valuable backlinks for your site.\n4. Influencer Collaboration:\nBuilding relationships with influencers, bloggers, and thought leaders is a potent strategy. When influencers recognize the value in your content, they may share it with their extensive audience, providing your website with authoritative backlinks and increased visibility.\n5. Resource Creation:\nCrafting comprehensive resources such as guides, tools, or infographics positions your website as an authoritative source. Other websites seeking valuable content are more likely to link to these resources, bolstering your backlink profile.\n6. Social Media Integration:\nWhile not a direct SEO ranking factor, social media plays a crucial role in amplifying content. Link builders leverage social platforms to promote content, increasing its visibility and the likelihood of organic backlinks as users share and engage.\n7. Competitor Analysis:\nA strategic link builder conducts thorough competitor analysis to uncover potential opportunities. Identifying websites linking to competitors provides a target list for outreach, presenting your content as a valuable alternative.\n8. Local SEO Initiatives:\nFor businesses with a local presence, link builders focus on securing backlinks from local directories and community websites. These local citations contribute to improved local search rankings.\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, the work of an SEO link builder is both an art and a science. By combining creativity, strategic thinking, and effective relationship-building, link builders play a pivotal role in elevating a website's online presence. As algorithms evolve and competition intensifies, the skills and strategies employed by\nSEO link builders continue to be instrumental in achieving sustainable success in the digital realm.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD: An Accountability Court on Thursday fixed January 4 for the indictment of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana corruption reference. The Accountability Court judge, Muhammad Bashir, while hearing the case at Adiala jail set January 4 to frame the charge against Khan and his wife in the Toshakhana case. National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi and members of PTI’s legal team appeared before the court. During the hearing, copies of the reference and other necessary documents have been provided to the accused. The court adjourned the hearing of the case on January 4. The anti-graft watchdog filed the reference against Khan and his wife on December 21. Khan was disqualified on October 21, 2022, from the National Assembly for five years by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) after he was found guilty of concealing facts about selling expensive gifts. According to the NAB, the inquiry proceedings have revealed that as former prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan was presented with 108 gifted state assets, out of the same, 58 gifted state assets were retained by Khan. He did not deposit the gifted state assets in Toshakhana for fair price assessment in contravention of rules and subsequently retained said gifted state items worth millions of rupees, it says. The gifted state assets were retained without fair price assessment for your benefit,it said, adding that moreover, Khan sold/misappropriated some of the gifted state assets for personal benefit. The NAB said that investigation proceedings further revealed that during Bushra Bibi being the wife of ex-PM, received gifts from foreign dignitaries amounting to millions of rupees and retained these gifts against a meager retention cost based on under value assessment/appraisement.

    "text": "Lungenentzündung, Larven unter der Haut: Das lösen die heißen Temperaturen in Badeseen aus\nHitze, Hitze, Hitze und das schon lange: Da will man eine Abkühlung. Die heimischen Seen laden ins kühle Nass ein. Doch auch in den Gewässern steigt durch die andauernde Wärme die Temperatur. Welche Auswirkungen die Hitze auf die Seen haben kann und welche Gefahren für Badegäste dadurch drohen.\nRosenheim - Es ist heiß. Schon seit Tagen hat eine Hitzewelle weite Teile des Landes fest im Griff. Vor allem am Mittwoch (2. Juli) wurden mancherorts Temperaturen bis an die 40 Grad erwartet. Wer auf der Suche nach ein bisschen Abkühlung war und nicht gerade einen Pool im eigenen Garten hat, holte sich die Erfrischung in einem der vielen Seen im Landkreis Rosenheim. Doch wie frisch und gut sind die Badegewässer nach den Hitze-Tagen noch?\nSchließlich wollen schon einige Badegäste am Simssee einen unangenehmen Geruch wahrgenommen haben, der vom See ausging. Wie das Staatliche Gesundheitsamt auf OVB-Anfrage mitteilt, gab es keine Auffälligkeiten bei der letzten Messung der Wasserqualität des Simmsees. Der angebliche Gestank sei auch für die Behörde neu. „Das Staatliche Gesundheitsamt wird dem Hinweis aber nachgehen“, heißt es weiter.\nDenn die Badeseen werden regelmäßig auf ihre Qualität geprüft. „In der laufenden Badesaison 2025 wurden die EU-Badestellen der Region bereits zu drei verschiedenen Zeitpunkten beprobt“, teilt Sibylle Gaßner-Nickl vom Landratsamt Rosenheim auf Anfrage mit. Die Kontrollen erfolgen alle vier Wochen. Dabei stellt sie auch klar: „Die Experten bescheinigen den Badeseen in Stadt und Landkreis Rosenheim durchwegs eine hervorragende mikrobiologische Qualität.“ Das sei auch bei den letzten Messungen der Fall gewesen.\nDiese sein bereits am 16. oder 24. Juni vorgenommen worden. Beide Termine liegen also vor der langen Hitzephase. Inwieweit die Wassertemperatur in Badeseen in den vergangenen Tagen gestiegen ist, liegt dem Landratsamt daher nicht vor. Dass aber die Temperatur in den Seen gestiegen ist, zeigt ein Blick auf den Chiemsee.\nDas Bayrische Landesamt für Umwelt misst durchgehend die Temperatur des Chiemsees in Prien-Stock. Vom 25. Mai bis zum 2. Juli hat sich die Temperatur um ganze sechs Grad erhöht. Die Wassertemperatur beträgt laut der aktuellen Messung 26,4 Grad. Am 1. Juli hat der Chiemsee laut Messungen des bayrischen Landesamts für Umwelt seine bisherige Höchsttemperatur mit 27,3 Grad erreicht. Doch welche Auswirkungen haben die gestiegenen Temperaturen für das Wasser – und damit auch für Badende?\nEine Rolle spielen die Bakterien. Schaut man sich den Simssee an, findet man dort im Wasser Cyanobakterien, auch Blaualgen genannt. Ein Schild am Baierbacher Badestrand weist auf den Algenwuchs hin. Bereits Ende Mai war ein roter Teppich aus den Blaualgen auf dem Simssee und die Algen haben jetzt noch bessere Bedingungen, um sich auszubreiten. Denn hohe Wassertemperaturen können den Sauerstoffmangel im See verstärken. In solchen Fällen spricht man auch oft davon, dass das Wasser „kippt“. Das weiß auch Klaus Moritz vom Wasserwirtschaftsamt Rosenheim und erklärt, dass so mehr Algen im See sind als sonst: „Warme Temperaturen fördern das Wachstum von Algen, insbesondere von schädlichen Altgenarten, die toxische Substanzen produzieren können.“\nEs kann schwere Folgen haben\nDiese toxischen Substanzen können dem Menschen gefährlich werden, denn „bei Kontakt oder Verschlucken der Bakterien treten oft Haut-, Atemwegs- und Magen-Darm-Reizungen auf“, warnt Dr. Michael Iberer. Er ist Hausarzt und gleichzeitig Vorsitzender des ärztlichen Kreisverbands Rosenheim. Laut ihm können durch den geförderten Wachstum der Algen gesundheitliche Risiken entstehen. Der Mediziner betont, dass die Vorfälle mit den Bakterien zwar meist mild sind, aber trotzdem auch schwere Reaktionen – zum Beispiel eine Lungenentzündung – auftreten können.\nAber nicht nur die Blaualgen vermehren sich bei der warmen Wassertemperatur hervorragend, sondern auch andere Mikroorganismen und Zerkarien, auch Saugwurm-Larven genannt, nutzen laut Iberer die warmen Bedingungen. Das kann ebenfalls gesundheitliche Risiken mit sich bringen. Diese Saugwurm-Larven können „beim Baden in die Haut eindringen und die sogenannte ‚Schwimmkrätze‘ verursachen“, erklärt Iberer. Das heißt, die Larven dringen in die Haut ein, sterben dort ab und lösen juckende, rötliche Pusteln aus. Das kann bis zu mehrere Tage anhalten.\nAugen auf beim Baden\nDas Gesundheitsamt empfiehlt vor dem Schwimmen das Wasser in Augenschein zu nehmen. Ist das Wasser grünlich-trüb oder rötlich-trüb? Schwimmt eine grüne, Schlieren ziehende Schicht auf der Oberfläche? Ist das der Fall, sollte man das Wasser nicht schlucken, warnt das Amt. Außerdem empfehlen sie, nach dem Schwimmen die Badesachen zu wechseln und sich mit einem Handtuch abzureiben.\nÄhnlich sieht es auch Michael Iberer. Sollte man am See doch mal mit den Blaualgen in Kontakt kommen, empfiehlt er gründlich zu duschen und bei Symptomen wie Hautreizungen, Übelkeit oder Atemprobleme ärztlichen Rat einzuholen. Außerdem betont er, dass auch Haustiere von dem betroffenen Wasser ferngehalten werden sollen.",

    "title": "NBA Leap Years: Victor Wembanyama Leads List Of 10 Players Poised To Level Up In 2024-25 Season - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "If you've followed the NBA for even a modicum of time, you've surely heard any number of pundits and fans alike talking about a particular player taking \"the leap.\" It means different things for different players. For some, it's a leap bad to serviceable, or from serviceable to good, or from good to great, or, finally, from a star to superstar. It's signals more than just natural improvement. It's a leap. And the 10 players below feel poised to take it in the 2024-25 season. Does this even need to be explained? Wembanyama is poised to be the league's best defender and one of the 10-15 best players overall in his second season. If that isn't a leap, what is? Go look at the success he and the Spurs had with Tre Jones as his point guard. Nothing special. Just highly functional stuff. Getting Wemby the ball at the right spot at the right time. Do that, and he's going to do his thing. Who did the Spurs sign this summer? Chris Paul. Even at nearly 40 years old, point guard play isn't going to get much more functional than Paul. For Wemby, Defensive Player of the Year and even All-NBA feel like near certainties. MVP votes are not out of the question. The Spurs are slow playing this and giving him room to explore his vast skill ranges, but his feel for the game is obvious. He knows how to play. He's not doing stuff just to do it. His passing has gone to another level already, and this season he should start moving closer to understanding his particular shot spots and how best to reach them. He'll probably be in for another massive leap in year three. But year two is going to be quite a show. Already one of the best defenders in the league, Holmgren's leap, if it happens, will come on the offensive end -- where he can become a higher-volume 3-point shooter (his 4.3 attempts per game could justifiably jump to six or even seven) and someone who creates more for himself rather than existing almost entirely as a roller and spacer. It remains to be seen how much OKC positions him to do the latter. Obviously Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is going to control things and Jalen Williams carries a lot of creative weight, but he Thunder move. The ball pops. They cut. By virtue of the activity Holmgren will find himself in more and more leveraged situations, and attacking those with his handle and ability to get to his own shot could turn him into a 20 PPG guy in relatively short order. A lot of people laughed at the Hornets for taking Miller with the second pick in 2023 over Scoot Henderson (I was one of them). If their respective rookie seasons are any indication of what's to come, Charlotte will be having the last laugh as Miller was superb in his first NBA campaign at 17 PPG on 37% 3-point shooting. It wasn't the most efficient shooting season, and that's where Miller makes the leap in year two. Miller is a natural midrange scorer, but he is also a capable high-flying finisher if he takes the step of playing through contact, and he can stretch some of those long twos back beyond the arc. Last season, Miller took just under seven 3s per game; this season he could, and probably should, be taking closer to 10 triples on a nightly basis. A slight shift in the shot diet and Miller is going to be an easy 20 PPG guy. He might hit that number this season on what feels like an inevitable progression toward being the best player on the team. Shaedon Sharpe is probably the guy in Portland who looks, on paper, more poised for a traditional leap into greater prominence as a 20 PPG scorer, but Henderson, by virtue of how underwhelming his rookie season was, has so much room for improvement that even a few steps forward is going to feel like a leap. Henderson is a good bet to take more than a few steps. First, he shot 82% from the free-throw line, which suggests his shooting in general should be able to at least sustain, if not improve upon, the 35% clip that he registered from 3-point land after the All-Star break last season. Over his final seven games he put up over 19 points and nine assists on 42% 3-point shooting. Small sample, yes, but Henderson's raw ability is unquestionable and now that we've seen some basis of skill development, from leveled-up passing to pull-up jumpers and range shooting, Henderson feels ripe for potentially the biggest second-year leap of anyone on this list. Johnson has already broken out, averaging 16 points, eight boards and almost four assists last season. Now comes the leap into, dare I say, fringe All-Star territory? He has that kind of ability, and he won't be lacking for opportunity. The Hawks love him, and rightfully so. Reports have indicated he was their only untouchable player this summer. Atlanta's wing chart is saturated but Johnson is penciled in at the four. He's going to become a pretty regular 20-point scorer, if not a nightly one. Paired with Trae Young, he has all the makings of what John Collins was becoming before his developing 3-point shot disappeared and his place in the Atlanta offense followed. He can jump out of the gym and shoot from deep. He can really pass, too. He's the kind of long, athletic defender everyone covets. Johnson just needs to stay healthy. If he does, his stock is going to soar. Not enough people realize how good Kuminga already is because he never feels like he's good enough for the Warriors to be passing up big-name trades in order to keep him. There's a reason they are set on him. Kuminga averaged 16 PPG last season, and with limitless athleticism and ideal positional size his ceiling feels pretty damn high. He's a better shooter than his 32% 3-point clip last season suggests; he just needs to be confident and in rhythm, and this year there likely won't be any messing with his minutes. As one of only guys who offer an athletic advantage for the Warriors, he needs to make a leap if the Warriors intend on being a playoff team. My bet is close to 20 PPG on increasing efficiency and defensive impact more in line with his physical and athletic profile. Podziemski shot better than 38% from 3 last season on just over four attempts per game. He has said the Warriors want him to at least double that volume this year to 8-10 3s per game. On that alone, Podz, who was a first-team All-Rookie player last year and might well be the biggest reason Lauri Markkanen isn't a Warrior (Golden State basically refused to give him up in a trade this summer), is poised to leap from nine points per game to potentially 15-plus with a much more featured role and the freedom to fire away in the absence of Klay Thompson. Where will Podziemski find all these extra 3s? He's already noted shots he had last season that he simply passed up, but he can also dial up his own creation. Albeit in small samples, Podziemski made 42.5% of his off-the-dribble 3-pointers last season, per Synergy, while converting 41% of his pull-up 3s and an eye-popping 56.5% of his step-backs according to NBA shot-tracking data. The Rockets have a small army of leap candidates. Amen Thompson feels like an Andre Iguodala in the making. Cam Whitmore feels like a young Corey Maggette. Jalen Green has the goods to become an All-Star. Alperen Sengun is already awesome, and like Green, he's also only entering his fourth season. But Smith, who is Houston's most well-rounded player, is the guy to really watch. Smith is already quite good, but you have to look a bit deeper in the cracks of the game to fully appreciate his value, as opposed to a guy like Jalen Green, whose scoring and shot creation pops but may lack some substance. Smith is pure substance, on both ends, and the shooting efficiency improved dramatically (40% to 45% overall and 30% to 36% from 3) from year one to two. Smith's growing confidence stands out. He's looking for his shot more often, and aggressively pursuing his spots as a self-creator. A jump from 13 to 17ish PPG feels plenty doable, and given all the things that Smith does defensively, that's starting to flirt with best-player-on-the-team status. George can clearly score, though the efficiency needs to ratchet up considerably, but the Jazz clearly want him to be the point guard of the future and thus need to see development in his decision making and stewardship of the offense. The opportunity is there for him to take a big leap this season. His talent suggests he'll take advantage. What would constitute a leap? On paper, let's get that shooting percentage up from below 40 to the mid 40s, and the 3-point clip to at least league average. If he can do that, given his creativity, tough-shot-making ability and burst, 16-18 PPG, up from 13, is reasonable. But it's beyond raw numbers. To me, George clearly has it. Even as a score-first guy, it's easy to see him parlaying that scoring threat into opportunities for teammates on a consistent basis, and before long his being the guy that is controlling more of the court than anyone else. When he's clicking, which he was in plenty of stretches las a rookie, he has that kind of gravitas with the ball in his hands. I would expect an impressive sophomore campaign from George. Nembhard's breakout officially started in the playoffs, where shot 48% from 3 and was Indiana's best player against Boston in the conference finals, registering 56 points and 19 assists over the final two games of the series. Those hard numbers aren't going to become the norm, but Nembhard, who went from 18 minutes a game in November to consistently near 30 by the end of the regular season, is about to land on a lot more radars this season when he should be good for close to 30 minutes a night on average, double-digit scoring and plus 3-point shooting to go with his typical ball-pressure defense. Like young Goran Dragic, Immanuel Quickley and early Fred VanVleet, Nembhard could be the next backup point guard we start talking about as potentially worthy of his own team.
