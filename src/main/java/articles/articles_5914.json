    "text": "Dec. 5, 2024\nThis paid piece is sponsored by Dakota State University.\nAdaptable.\nThat’s the ideal word to describe the College of Arts & Sciences at Dakota State University.\n“We used to say that an arts and sciences degree helped open doors in any career field,” said Dr. Stacey Berry, dean of the college. “Even with the rise of emerging technologies, this is still true because arts and sciences play a key role in supporting the human-machine collaboration that defines today’s AI-driven workplace.”\n“Today’s tech-augmented work environment requires a strong human element,” Berry added.\n“Employers are looking for professionals who excel in critical thinking, communication and creativity, and these are the skills that make our graduates adaptable and indispensable in the workplace.”\nThis adaptability is a hallmark of DSU’s College of Arts & Sciences, which blends interdisciplinary learning, creativity and cutting-edge technology to prepare students for the dynamic job market.\n“Our programs foster leaders and decision-makers who thrive in collaborative environments,” Berry said.\nShe took on the role as dean this fall, after 14 years teaching in the English program. Drawn to DSU because of its student-centered vision and forward-thinking integration of technology, she transitioned into administration to amplify the successes of students and faculty. “Being an advocate for others has shown me how rewarding leadership can be,” she said.\nLooking to the future, Berry is passionate about driving innovation in the curriculum and research.\n“What motivates me is finding ways that technology and collaboration can inform programs and position our graduates for success.”\nEthan Sip is one of the DSU students whose artwork was featured in a recent student exhibition at the Madison Area Arts Council.\nEvery major in the College of Arts & Sciences incorporates technology as a vital element of applied learning. For example, students studying animation and graphic design begin with hand-drawn and hand-painted projects before leveraging technology to explore other possible results. This combination of human-centered and technical skills makes them uniquely prepared for the demands of the industry.\nPrograms in math, science and English similarly align with the university’s cyber and computer science initiatives, including artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Faculty in these areas are heavily involved with teaching and researching emerging technologies, often engaging undergraduate students in groundbreaking projects. These efforts highlight the college’s commitment to innovation across all disciplines.\nDr. Bill Bendix teaches in the Cyber Leadership & Intelligence program through the College of Arts & Sciences at DSU. This major incorporates the study of technology with world cultures, international politics and leadership.\nBerry emphasizes that adaptability doesn’t just come from curriculum innovation — it’s also about staying connected to the workforce. The college offers degrees in emerging fields such as computer game design, cyber leadership and intelligence, and digital content creation. Programs like these reflect the college’s interest in employer needs and the skills that are most in demand.\n“We’re eager to collaborate with companies, organizations and professionals who can serve on our advisory boards or guide us toward developing certificates or courses tailored to workforce needs,” Berry said.\n“Our graduates are not only prepared for their first jobs but are also positioned to lead and adapt as industries evolve,” demonstrating that the College of Arts & Sciences is committed to building connections for long-term success.\nMany DSU science majors are involved in hands-on research projects, a unique opportunity for undergraduate students.\nBy staying adaptable, innovative and connected, the college is setting the standard for a new era of interdisciplinary education.",

    "text": "***The Foreign Minister of the Republic, Yván Gil, highlighted the permanence of a solid, participatory and leading democracy in the country, where the center of decision-making is in the people of Venezuela***\nThe Foreign Minister of the Republic, Yván Gil, reported that to date Venezuela has more than 635 confirmations of international observers interested in accompanying the presidential electoral process, whose voting day will take place on July 28.\nFrom the Casa Amarilla, headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gil, in a meeting with the diplomatic corps, highlighted the permanence of a solid, participatory and leading democracy in the country, where the center of decision-making is in the people of Venezuela, therefore, “our electoral system has been built to provide the greatest possible transparency,” he said.\nHe said that the United Nations Group of Electoral Experts arrived in Venezuela on Tuesday to monitor the process. At the same time, he recalled that the Carter Center, the African Union, more than 65 electoral directors from around the world and invited governments will also do the same on July 28.\n“We are happy to open ourselves to the world so that they can see what will happen in Venezuela,” said Gil, highlighting that Venezuela has one of the best electoral systems in the world.\nIn this regard, he emphasized the security and transparency of the vote of Venezuelans, since it has “an automated system, both the vote and the counting are done digitally, without the subjectivity of the manipulation of minutes, it is an auditable system in all its phases, the entire process is absolutely transparent, in addition there is an electronic count done by the machine and manually by the table members,” he explained.\nOn the other hand, he stressed that the electoral campaign of the 10 candidates has been carried out peacefully and with complete normality: “The candidates have already made their proposals, some have submitted them to the National Electoral Council, as is appropriate, while others have made it known through the media,” he added.\nOn Wednesday, the National Electoral Council (CNE) began the process of auditing the software for totalization and production of voting machines, thus complying with what was established in the electoral schedule, in view of the presidential elections on July 28.\nAccording to information published in the media, the software audit began at 9:00 a.m. in Plaza Caracas, with the main purpose of checking the totalization system and its components.\nThe production of the machines began at 11:00 a.m. in Mariche. During this process, representatives of political organizations and technicians from the electoral body verify that the machines are produced with the certification codes.\n#international #observers #confirmed #support #Venezuela #June #elections\n2024-07-12 04:48:53",

    "text": "Como ha sucedido en los últimos días, la espesa bruma afectó este viernes las operaciones en el Aeropuerto Internacional Indira Gandhi de Nueva Delhi, aún cuando se detectó un mejoramiento leve de la visibilidad en la pista. Además de retrasos en los vuelos por más de tres horas, la niebla también ocasionó alteraciones en la llegada y salida de 11 trenes con destino al estado capital y supuso un desafío para los conductores en las carreteras, según reportes. También se emitió un aviso para extremar las precauciones en las carreteras con el uso de luces antineblina y a los viajeros que se mantengan actualizados sobre los horarios de las aerolíneas, los ferrocarriles y el transporte estatal. A la población en general se le recomendó el uso de mascarillas para la protección de la severa contaminación del aire en esos territorios. El Departamento Meteorológico de India pronosticó que esas condiciones continuarán en el norte durante los próximos dos días, al igual que ola de frío. Durante las últimas 24 horas, se registraron temperaturas mínimas de 8 a 12 grados centígrados en la mayor parte de Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar y Jharkhand, y se espera que disminuyan aún más. También es probable que más nieve despida el año en Jammu-Cachemira, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh y Uttarakhand. jha/lrd",

    "text": "La Copa Sevilla Tenis se está disputando en el Real Club de Tenis de la ciudad desde este pasado 1 de septiembre. La final está prevista para este domingo, por lo que tenemos por delante un fin de semana de tenis al más alto nivel en la ciudad.Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos Este torneo celebra su edición número 61, se trata del torneo con más prestigioso de Andalucía y el tercero de España, sólo por detrás del Conde Godó y el Master 1000 de Madrid. Este año también cuenta con la novedad de la tierra batida en sus pistas. Un terreno que ya han probado estos días grandes tenistas como Albert Ramos o Roberto Carballés. Santiago Pérez, director de la Copa Sevilla, ha atendido a 7TV para valorar el papel de este tenista y su importancia en la historia de este torneo: “Es favorito desde el momento en que ha sido finalista y campeón en dos ocasiones aquí”. El único inconveniente que se le puede buscar a este torneo es la fecha, que suele ser un problema a nivel logístico para los tenistas. De cara a la próxima edición, la organización se plantea cambiarlo: “Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos, llegan aquí con jet lag. Yo que hablo con ellos percibo lo complicado que es jugar un torneo como este cuando apenas han dormido tres horas”, añade Santiago Pérez a los micrófonos de 7TV. Aunque la Copa Sevilla se juega desde el año 1963, esta obtuvo la denominación de Challenger en el 1991, convirtiéndola así en puntuable para la ATP. A lo largo de su historia han pasado por sus pistas estrellas como Rafa Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz o Manolo Santana.

    "text": "A royal biographer says that the king feels he was not strict enough with his children - particularly Prince Harry. Royal expert Ingrid Seward believes she has insight on [King Charles III](/category/king-charles-iii/)'s major regret when it comes to his younger son, Prince Harry. In a new interview with Fox News Digital, Seward explained that the king feels he was not \"strict\" with his sons. She attributed this to their mother, [Princess Diana](/category/princess-diana/). Seward is currently promoting her new book My Mother and I, a biography about the relationship between King Charles and Queen Elizabeth II, and how it has affected the British royal family over the decades. The book comes out in August, but in the meantime Seward shared some of her findings with Fox. She said: \"Prince Harry and King Charles were very, very close. They got on incredibly well. I think Charles probably regrets that he wasn't strict with Harry and William.\" Seward said that Princess Diana had a \"freestyle\" approach to parenting when [Prince William](/category/prince-william/) and Prince Harry were first born, and that the king simply went along with this philosophy up until Diana's death in 1997. She said: \"Diana allowed them to do, more or less, what they wanted, which was very fashionable in those days. You let children just get on with things. I think Charles probably regrets that he wasn't a bit stricter, because it might've given both boys a few more boundaries.\" \"Children all need boundaries, and I don't think they had too many,\" Seward continued. So far, Buckingham Palace has not commented publicly on Seward's insights, though some reporters have contacted the institution for comment. As for Prince Harry, he has been very open when it comes to his family dynamics over the last few years, ever since he stepped down as a senior royal in 2020 and moved to the U.S. Just this year, Prince Harry flew to the U.K. as soon as he learned that his father had been diagnosed with cancer . He then joined Good Morning America for an interview where he said: \"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\" When asked if this ordeal might have a \"reunifying effect\" for him and the other royals, Prince Harry said: \"Yeah, I'm sure.\" Prince Harry's relationship with his brother is much less certain, and there are conflicting reports about their status coming out all the time. So far, Prince Harry has not visited Prince William or his wife Kate Middleton since Middleton was diagnosed with cancer, but they may have a chance to get together next month. There's no telling whether they'll take it. [0comments](#)",

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link)\nLogo du constructeur automobile allemand Volkswagen, lors du salon de l'automobile à Paris, le 16 octobre 2024\nLe conflit social est désormais inéluctable pour le premier constructeur européen: tous les salariés de Volkswagen en Allemagne sont appelés à cesser le travail à partir de lundi pour s'opposer aux milliers de suppressions d'emplois envisagées.\nC'est la première étape d'un mouvement qui pourrait prendre une ampleur inédite si la direction et les représentants du personnels ne parviennent pas à trouver d'accord sur les mesures d'économies pour restructurer le groupe en crise.\nUne perspective qui survient en pleine campagne pour les élections législatives anticipées en Allemagne.\n\"Des grèves d'avertissement commenceront lundi dans toutes les usines\", a annoncé dimanche dans un communiqué Thorsten Gröger, le négociateur du syndicat IG Metall, à l'issue de la période de dialogue social obligatoire pour 120.000 employés de la marque en Allemagne.\n\"Si nécessaire, ce sera la bataille de négociation collective la plus dure que Volkswagen ait jamais connue\", prévient-il, tenant la direction pour \"responsable, à la table des négociations, de la durée et de l'intensité de cet affrontement\".\nDans un communiqué séparé, Volkswagen a dit \"respecter le droit des salariés\" et croire au \"dialogue constructif\", en vertu du principe de cogestion, pour \"parvenir à une solution durable et soutenue collectivement\".\nL'entreprise précise avoir \"anticipé des mesures ciblées pour sécuriser l'approvisionnement d'urgence\" pendant le mouvement.\nDans le pays, Volkswagen compte dix sites de production de voitures et environ 300.000 salariés, dont 120.000 pour la marque VW, la plus concernée par le plan d'économies.\nIG Metall, le puissant syndicat de la métallurgie a dit être prêt \"à un conflit social comme la République fédérale n'en a pas connu depuis des décennies\".\nLe premier constructeur européen a lancé en septembre une chasse aux coûts inédite, visant des économies de plusieurs milliards d'euros pour redresser sa compétitivité.\nTrois séances de négociations entre direction et syndicat ont eu lieu et \"la différence entre les positions est encore énorme\", selon Thorsten Gröger.\nLe fossé s'est même creusé avec le rejet vendredi par la direction d'une contre-proposition syndicale visant à réduire les coûts sans avoir à fermer d'usines en Allemagne.\nLa direction du groupe continue d'envisager de fermer des usines en Allemagne, trois selon le syndicat, ce qui serait une première dans l'histoire du groupe.\nDes employés de l'usine VW de Zwickau, en Allemagne, lors d'une réunion d'information du comité d'entreprise\nLes deux parties se retrouveront le 9 décembre à Wolfsburg pour un quatrième tour des négociations.\nFleuron de l'industrie automobile allemande, Volkswagen souffre à la fois du ralentissement du marché des véhicules neufs, de la concurrence chinoise, de modèles à batterie pas assez attractifs, et de coûts de main d’œuvre plus élevés que ses rivaux, selon les experts.\nLa crise chez Volkswagen reflète les difficultés de l'industrie allemande, confrontée ces derniers mois à une kyrielle de plans sociaux dans les secteurs de l'automobile, la chimie, la sidérurgie, alors que l'activité économique du pays devrait se contracter en 2024, pour la deuxième année de suite.\nLa paralysie politique obscurcit aussi l'horizon depuis la rupture début novembre de la coalition du chancelier Olaf Scholz, qui provoque l'organisation d'élections anticipées le 23 février.\nLa relance de l'économie s'est imposée comme un enjeu central de la campagne.\nAinsi samedi, le chancelier social-démocrate (SPD) Olaf Scholz et le chef de file des conservateurs (CDU) Friedrich Merz se sont opposés sur le sujet par meetings interposés.\nDes employés du constructeur automobile allemand Volkswagen assistent à une réunion d'information organisée par les syndicats le 28 octobre 2024 au siège de l'entreprise à Wolfsburg, dans le nord de l'Allemagne\nFavori des sondages, Friedrich Merz a fustigé \"l'interventionnisme teinté de vert dans chaque domaine de la vie, chaque entreprise, chaque secteur d'activité\" des Verts et du SPD, alliés au sein de la coalition gouvernementale.\nOlaf Scholz, pour qui la CDU a \"toujours la même recette\", faite de baisses d'impôts pour les entreprises, a lui proposé de rembourser 10% d'impôts sur les sommes investies par les entreprises dans le pays.",

This distinct accounting method verifies that the certified feedstock has replaced an equivalent quantity of fossil raw materials at the beginning of the supply chain and can be attributed to the product-to-be-sold, ensuring that both input and output are balanced. [source ISCC]\nA bio-attributed content indicates that the use of a biobased feedstock has been ascribed using a mass-balance methodology. The bio-attributed content is the % breakdown based on the ISCC+ methodology calculation. It is a clear distinction to materials in which the biobased content can be verified using the radiocarbon method.

    "text": "July 2, 2025 – The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) – The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) strongly condemns and denounces the heinous crime committed by Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) on Wednesday afternoon, resulting in the killing of Dr. Marwan ‘Omar Rab’ie al-Sultan , General Director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza and Consultant in Cardiovascular Diseases and Surgery, alongside eight members of his family, including his wife, daughter, sister and others.\nThis was a deliberate and targeted airstrike on a residential apartment, where Dr. al-Sultan sought shelter after being forcibly displaced to western Gaza City.\nPCHR stresses that this crime is yet another addition to the series of grave violations committed by IOF against medical personnel as part of a systematic policy to decimate Gaza’s healthcare system.\nThis is part of the broader and ongoing crime of genocide that has been perpetrated for the past 21 months amid the disgraceful silence of the international community, which continues to tolerate these atrocities without meaningful accountability.\nAccording to information obtained by PCHR’s staff, at around 14:15 on Wednesday, 2 July 2025, Israeli warplanes targeted a residential apartment located near the former Chalets area in western Gaza City.\nAs a result, nine people were killed, including Dr. Marwan ‘Omar Rab’ie al-Sultan (49), his wife, Thekra Nemer al-Sultan (45), their 19-year-old daughter, Lamis, his sister, Amnah ‘Omar al-Sultan, Malak Eyad al-Sultan (15), ‘Aisha ‘Emad al-Sultan (25), her brother Mohammed (28) and Asmaa’ Joudi al-Sultan (37).\nDr. al-Sultan and his family sought shelter in this rented apartment in western Gaza City after they had been forcibly displaced from northern Gaza due to the recurrent Israeli incursions in the area that have destroyed houses and civilian and healthcare facilities.\nThe targeting of a displaced civilian doctor and his family while sheltering in a residential apartment constitutes a war crime under the international humanitarian law.\nIt is also a blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions as well as the rules pertaining to the protection of civilians and medical personnel during armed conflicts.\nDr. Marwan al-Sultan is one of the most distinguished Palestinian medical professionals and a leading humanitarian figure in the Gaza Strip. He was a Cardiovascular Surgery Specialist and became the director of the Indonesian Hospital after IOF had arrested the Hospital’s former director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, in a previous raid of the hospital in November 2023.\nDespite repeated threats, Dr. al-Sultan remained committed to his duties managing the Hospital and ensuring the continued provision of healthcare services under complicated humanitarian conditions.\nHis leading role was significantly critical after northern Gaza’s hospitals had gone out of service, including al-Shifa Medical Complex, due to bombardment, destruction and shutdown.\nDuring the forced shutdown of northern Gaza’s hospitals, Dr. al-Sultan also served in Beit al-Kheir Medical Center in Jabalia, which had become the last remaining medical facility for patients in northern Gaza.\nThrough this, he exemplified extraordinary humanitarian and professional dedication, continuing to provide medical care under relentless bombardment, crippling lack of resources and severe shortage of medical personnel and equipment.\nThe Indonesian Hospital has been under dozens of attacks, including bombardment, raids, and deliberate arson. As a result, many patients and members of medical personnel have been killed while the hospital’s infrastructure has been progressively destroyed.\nThe latest major attack was in May when IOF destroyed the hospital’s generators and main departments, forcing the medical personnel, including al-Sultan, to evacuate.\nThe assassination of Dr. al-Sultan is not an isolated incident but is part of a systematic and deliberate Israeli policy to eliminate the medical personnel and dismantle the Palestinian healthcare system, a tool within Israel’s ongoing genocidal campaign on the Gaza Strip.\nAccording to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on 7 October 2023, IOF have killed at least 1,582 medical personnel and injured 362 others, including doctors and paramedics, among them two died under torture in Israeli prisons.\nPCHR warns that the systematic killing of medical personnel is a direct factor contributing to the catastrophic collapse of the healthcare system in Gaza, which has become totally unable to provide even the most basic medical services amidst the persistent Israeli attacks and absence of any effective international intervention.\nThe situation in Gaza is beyond catastrophic and amounts to the systematic eradication of the Palestinian existence and total destruction of life-sustaining sectors, including the healthcare system, all unfolding amid the international community’s shameful inaction and absence of accountability mandated by the international law.\nGiven this serious escalation, PCHR calls on the international community, particularly the United Nations (UN), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the UN Special Rapporteurs on the right to health and on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to take immediate and effective measures to stop these atrocious crimes, hold their perpetrators accountable, and ensure protection of Palestinian medical personnel and civilians.\nPCHR emphasizes that the international community’s silence, the complicity of some governments and the failure to activate the international justice mechanisms have emboldened the Israeli occupation to persist in its crimes with complete impunity.",
