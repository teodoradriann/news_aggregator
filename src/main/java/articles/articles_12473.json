    "text": "ST. LOUIS — Just in time for the St. Louis area’s first brush with dangerously cold temperatures, [HeatUpStLouis.org](https://heatupstlouis.org/) is launching its annual campaign to help pay for home heating. It’s called Rise and Shine for Heat, in partnership with Hardee’s. The kick-off was Thursday at Commerce Bank in Clayton. This marks the 24th year. HeatUpStLouis.org is asking for volunteer groups on Feb. 9 to sign-up to greet people at participating Hardee’s restaurants to solicit donations. HeatUp is also taking advance orders for biscuits at HeatUpStLouis.org. The annual effort’s slogan is “Have a heart. Heat a home.” Founder Gentry Trotter was asked about donations. “It’s been off pretty bad,” Trotter said. “It’s down by 38% or more. Our little money, unlike other big charities, the money we get from all of these people, 100% of it goes directly to helping somebody. There is no administrative fee because our board members underwrite our administrative costs.” St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson was there on behalf of the St. Louis Fire Chief’s Association. Jenkerson said every year, fire officials see death and destruction caused by the improper use of space heaters. “You know, people look for alternative sources of heat,” the chief said. “They are trying to reduce their overall heating bill. Space heaters are the bane of any fire department.” The HeatUpStLouis.org Hardee’s Rise and Shine event takes place Feb. 9 at all St. Louis area Hardee’s in Missouri and Illinois from 6-10:30 a.m. Rev. Earl E. Nance is HeatUpStLouis.org Corporate Treasurer. “You have seniors making decisions between heating and eating,” said Nance. “With this cold and inclement weather coming in, it is important for us to check on our neighbors. HeatUpStLouis.org Board President Ben Turec said, “We always need volunteers, and you can actually go to [HeatUpStLouis.org](https://heatupstlouis.org/) now and order biscuits for $1. You get your choice of egg or sausage biscuits. You can order 20 or more; they’re a dollar each and everything goes to HeatUpStLouis.org.” Ameren Vice President of Energy Solutions and Business Development Tara Oglesby said, “Ameren works with organizations like HeatUpStLouis.org to make sure that when there are people who can’t pay their bills, they have resources.” Trotter said HeatUpStLouis.org is in its 24th year of the Rise and Shine partnership with Hardee’s. On its website, the organization is signing up volunteers for the event. Volunteers will work one-hour shifts greeting guests in the restaurant or drive-thru, encouraging them to give extra to HeatUpStLouis.org. “So, please, give us a dollar,” Turek said. “Twenty, if you can. And if you’re in trouble, and you’re getting your energy source turned off, please go to heatupstlouis.org and let us know. It’s really easy. We can help.” To watch 5 or reports 24/7, 5 On Your Side is always streaming on 5+.

    "title": "Elon Musk may look secular, but he's enacting a Christian nationalist agenda",
    "text": "Elon Musk does not read to most people as a religious man. The tech billionaire who is attempting to take over the entire federal government through his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) was once even regarded as an atheist. In 2013, Musk scoffed at the idea \"that there's some superconsciousness watching over our every movement.\" He argued that evolutionary theory was better than a supernatural explanation for making sense of our world. As he ransacks the federal government, trying to push out federal employees and lay waste to the ability of regulatory agencies to do their work, the last thing most people will assume motivates him is Christian fervor.\nOver the summer, Musk told Jordan Peterson during an interview that while he's not \"a particularly religious person,\" he would say, \"I’m probably a cultural Christian.\"\nFor Musk personally, it probably doesn't. But his efforts to evacuate the federal government of the every day, non-political employees nonetheless serve a Christian nationalist agenda, which Musk is no doubt aware of. The secular-seeming brand of DOGE serves a useful propagandistic purpose by concealing how much Musk is following the Project 2025 playbook developed by Christian nationalists for the explicit purpose of remaking America in the fundamentalist image. Musk is the obnoxious, trolling face of the operation, but he works hand-in-glove with the Project 2025 author who called for an \"army\" of people with a \"Biblical worldview\" to replace the existing federal workforce. The explicit plan is to replace federal workers who Musk forces out with people who pass \"ideological purity tests,\" largely based on their eagerness to make America something very much like a theocracy.\nWhile Musk is snagging most headlines with his loud-mouthed antics, his partner in the federal purge operation is Russ Vought, a self-described Christian nationalist who Trump appointed to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Vought has developed the justification for ignoring the clear language of the Constitution, arguing this is a \"post-constitutional\" moment, in which law-breaking is justified to impose his theocratic vision on the country. Having Musk cover for Vought is savvy. Polls may show people's approval of Musk sinking the more they see of him, but his clownishness and personal success probably soften people's willingness to see him as the threat he is. Vought, however, is every inch a type most Americans know well and loathe: the creepy religious fanatic.\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only .\nProject 2025 was clear that its primary goal was to \"use government power\" to \"restore the American family,\" which is defined strictly in terms of male-dominated heterosexual couples with children. In its list of alleged threats to the \"family,\" the playbook lists phrases like \"sexual orientation,\" \"gender equality\" and \"reproductive health.\" The document goes into elaborate detail about how federal offices can be used to implement this compulsory and narrow heterosexuality, from abortion bans to replacing reproductive health services with abstinence-only lectures to even reimagining child support programs to bully women into remarrying ex-husbands.\nThe secular-seeming brand of DOGE serves a useful propagandistic purpose by concealing how much Musk is following the Project 2025 playbook developed by Christian nationalists for the explicit purpose of remaking America in the fundamentalist image.\nIf one looks away from Musk to Trump officials who have legal appointments, the Christian nationalist agenda that Musk is assisting becomes more obvious. Last week, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner announced the suspension of rules barring discrimination against LGBTQ people in low-income housing and even homeless shelters. The move will especially affect queer teenagers, who are often homeless after being kicked out by right-wing parents. Turner justified putting teenagers on the street by declaring, in his official statement, that this is what \"the Lord established from the beginning.\" Project 2025 called for HUD to end \"corrosive progressive ideologies across the department’s programs.\" Drastically reducing the existing HUD workforce so MAGA apparatchiks could control people's housing access — based no doubt on their prejudices — is outlined in this vision.\nThe purge at the Department of Justice (DOJ) has largely been covered as part of Donald Trump's \"revenge\" tour against everyone who tried to hold him accountable for alleged crimes during and after his first term in office. That is absolutely part of it, of course, but it also helps lay the groundwork for the Project 2025 goal of using DOJ powers to force the Christian right's agenda on normal people. Trump's new attorney general, Pam Bondi, has already been hinting in public that she is open to using federal prosecutors to prosecute doctors who mail abortion pills to women in states where clinics have been forcibly shut down. Louisiana is queuing up her first opportunity, by demanding the extradition of a New York-based doctor to their state, where they plan to put her on trial for providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teenager.\nRelated\nMusk took all their power, so Republicans remake Congress into a ministry of disinformation If Bondi bites, as legal experts Imani Gandy and Jessica Mason Pieklo explained at Rewire News, that opens the door for a broad Christian nationalist agenda outlined in Project 2025 to terrorize people for providing birth control, sex toys, or even sex education materials. The document argues that prosecutors can revive the Comstock Act, a 19th-century law that criminalized the mailing of \"obscene\" materials, which were broadly defined to cover all of these items. Project 2025 does not hold back from characterizing even basic sex education in this way, defining obscenity so broadly that even providing a \"how to use a condom\" manual — online or in a paper pamphlet — would be enough to be charged with a crime. Flushing the DOJ of good lawyers, so that they can be replaced with far-right hacks who hate birth control and queer people, is a first step to making this theocratic vision a reality.\nIf that sounds preposterous, it's worth noting that demonizing contraception and sex ed was central to Musk's illegal efforts to end USAID. He and Trump both repeatedly attacked a program in Mozambique that provided $5 million in contraceptives, though they inflated the number exponentially to make it $100 million and falsely claimed it was going to \"Hamas\" instead of young women in Africa. They've also suspended HIV-prevention drugs from being distributed overseas to anyone who isn't a pregnant or breastfeeding woman, who are at risk of transmitting the virus to babies. Anyone who isn't a baby is clearly considered deserving of death, because Christian fundamentalists believe you only get the virus through \"sin.\"\nMusk's past atheism and tendency to sleep with many different women hasn't stopped him from warming to the Christian right's loathing of sexual freedom. He's started echoing Christian right propaganda that paints the birth control pill as dangerous and unnatural. His friend, fellow tech billionaire Peter Thiel, has heavily invested in publications that promote the far-right Christian view that sex is only for marriage, and within marriage, it's only for procreation. (Thiel exempts himself from following his own prescriptions, as he's married to a man.)\nWe need your help to stay independent\nSubscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism Musk isn't ready to say he believes in God, but this shift to the right on sexual health issues is part of his larger embrace of Christian nationalism. Over the summer, he told Jordan Peterson during an interview that while he's not \"a particularly religious person,\" he would say, \"I’m probably a cultural Christian.\" He tried to frame this as a positive thing, with vague claims to believe in \"the teachings of Jesus,\" but as Victor Tangermann of Futurism pointed out , this is ridiculous. Pointing to Musk's \"long track record\" of treating other people like dirt, hoarding wealth, and stoking discord, Tangermann writes, has nothing to do with the Jesus \"who deeply opposed wealth inequality and supported the poor and outcasts.\" As David French at the New York Times pointed out , the illegal cuts to USAID have taken money from \"Christian organizations, including evangelical organizations, that serve poor and marginalized people at home and abroad.\"\nBut Musk has indeed embraced the cultural mores of Christian nationalists, whose faith is less about Jesus and more about using power to enforce their racist, sexist, and anti-queer views on the rest of Americans. Musk is obsessed with raising the birth rate and has explicitly noted, \"the more religious, the less educated, and the poorer, the higher the birth rate.\" It's not much of a leap to see what his conclusion is: that to drive up birth rates, he needs to make ordinary people poorer, less educated, and more religious. He may not believe in God, but he certainly finds it useful to force right-wing Christianity on others as a means of control.",

Los visitantes lo tenían en su mano con 84-88 tras un 0-13 a 1:09 del final... ¡pero fallaron tres tiros libres! Determinante una vez más el 'Facu' Campazzo con 22 puntos, seis asistencias y +29. Y 'Supermario', claro está.\nEl emblemático técnico que conquistó dos Euroligas y seis Ligas entre otros títulos en el banquillo blanco visitaba la capital de España por sexta vez con el tercer equipo diferente. En sus inicios perdió en Madrid con el Valencia Basket en la campaña 2004/05 (87-76) y estuvo a punto de ganar dos veces con el Gipuzkoa (110-100 en la prórroga en la temporada 2008/09 y 71-67 en la siguiente) para perder por un claro 83-53 en la 2010-11. El curso pasado también salió escaldado en la Euroliga como entrenador del FC Bayern (88-73).\nNo obstante, esta temporada sí había podido contra su exequipo en el duelo de Euroliga del Buesa Arena (88-73) con 15 puntos de Markus Howard y 14 de Chima Moneke. Desde entonces, el equipo que dirige Chus Mateo ha mejorado notablemente y ha escalado a la octava plaza en Europa y a la segunda en la Liga Endesa. Mientras, los vitorianos tratan de rehacerse tras quedar fuera de la Copa del Rey y malvivir en Euroliga, decimoquintos a tres triunfos del 'play in'.\nEl Baskonia llegó sin complejos al Movistar Arena y con buenas sensaciones tras vencer al campeón Panathinaikos (91-77) con 18 puntos de Moneke y 20 de un Luwawu-Cabarrot que ha sido este jueves baja de última hora. El Madrid empezó fuerte con cinco puntos de Tavares (10-4. min. 2:42) y los visitantes respondieron para tomar la delantera con un matazo de Moneke en la cara del 'gigante' caboverdiano tras rebote ofensivo (15-16, min. 6:07).\nLa clave de la primera parte radicó en los 10 rebotes en ataque de los vascos, lo que les permitió segundas y hasta terceras oportunidades. Los siete puntos de Campazzo neutralizaban por el momento la eclosión de Forrest y permitían a los blancos cerrar el primer cuarto con ventaja.\nHezonja aprovechó las facilidades defensivas para anotar con demasiada facilidad (31-26, min. 13:33), momento en el que la entrada del Rogkavopoulos agitó el partido. El griego lideró junto a Forrent la recuperación del Baskonia, que se adelantó con el undécimo punto del estadounidense (35-37, min. 17:09). Del resto se encargó el heleno con un triple y tres tiros libres para cerrar el segundo cuarto con 42-45.\nCinco puntos de Hezonja y un dos más uno de Campazzo lideraron la reacción madridista (52-51, min. 23:44) que dio paso a otro estirón visitante con sendos triples de Rogkavopoulos y de Howard (56-61, min. 26:52) y a un nuevo 4-0 para los locales desde un tiro libre que lleva años salvando los malos momentos colectivos. O provocan las faltas mejor que nadie o... ya saben (60-61, min. 27:36).\nEl decimoctavo rebote en ataque visitante permitió al griego anotar el 64-67 con el que acabó el tercer cuarto. El Madrid regresó con ánimos renovados con Campazzo como referente para volver a situarse por delante y esta vez por +5 (74-69). No era más que otro vaivén en una montaña rusa de partidos (los rusos la llaman montaña americana, por cierto). La cuarta falta de Howard devolvió a la pista a Forrest y entre él y un matazo impresionante de Samanic ante Tavares, el marcador reflejaba un 74-75 a 5:20 del final.\nTres tiros libres vergonzosos para Campazzo y otros tres igualmente discutibles para Musa provocaron una técnica a Laso. Cómo ha cambiado el cuento, ¿verdad? El Madrid se situó 84-75 (36:22), pero cinco puntos de un colosal Rogkavopoulos (22+10) y un 3+1 de Moneke permitieron un parcial de 0-13 (84-88 a 1:09 del final) tras una clara falta perdonada al ex del Manresa sobre Hezonja.\nUna gran defensa colectiva y un triple del croata apretaron el partido (87-88), Forrest falló dos tiros libres y Samanic anotó uno tras el 21ª rebote en ataque. 87-89 a falta de 17 segundos y triple del exazulgrana sobre la bocina (90-89). Gran victoria madridista en un partido sensacional.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Natural Health: I've been getting tonsillitis since my teens — what can I do to prevent it? From gargling with salt water to sage tea, manuka honey and zinc... here are some handy ways to try prevent tonsil infection in the first place The tonsils are the first line of defence against bacteria which is airborne or present in foods, so taking steps to prevent the infection in the first place is a great place to start. Picture: PA Photo/thinkstockphotos\nSun, 02 Feb, 2025 - 07:36 Megan Sheppard I’ve been getting tonsillitis since my teens, mostly during the winter. Sometimes, gargling with water helps, but other times, I need an antibiotic. What can I do to ensure I don’t get the infection in the first place?\nThe tonsils are the first line of defence against bacteria which is airborne or present in foods, so taking steps to prevent the infection in the first place is a great place to start. The mineral zinc is one of the best preventative measures for any type of throat infection. Zinc, specifically in the form of Zinc gluconate, is particularly useful in dealing with throat and respiratory issues and can help prevent repeat bouts of tonsillitis.\nGetting zinc directly to the back of the throat where you need it is easily done by taking zinc lozenges. Zinc is an important mineral for immunity since the body secretes zinc into fluids as an antiseptic. It is worth noting that tea, coffee, and alcohol all reduce zinc levels in the body.\nManuka honey is another good standby. It has been used to treat infections of both viral and bacterial origin, including streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. Take a teaspoon of the honey and hold it in your mouth as close to the affected area as you can, for as long as possible, before swallowing.\nGargling with water may help with the discomfort but you will need to add salt to treat and prevent infection.\nSalt can not only help to soothe inflammation in the mouth and throat, but it can also reduce bad breath issues, treat and prevent bacterial infection in the mouth, and relieve oral pain. Sage tea (common garden sage — Salvia officinalis) is another effective natural remedy for strengthening your immune defences and addressing recurrent bouts of tonsillitis. Most people have it in their garden or kitchen cupboard. Simply use a teaspoon of dried or fresh sage per cup of boiling water and steep for three to five minutes. You can add honey to taste if you wish.\nMy energy often dips between three and four in the afternoon, and finishing my work can be a struggle. is there a remedy I could use?\nCoenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10) and Carnitine are supplements health professionals and gym enthusiasts use to support mitochondrial function. CoQ10 is a crucial component of mitochondrial function, converting the energy from fats and sugars into cellular energy.\nCoQ10 can help solve your afternoon energy dips by supporting your body at a cellular level. Carnitine supports the mitochondria by delivering essential fatty acids to be burned as fuel, which is why it has a reputation for increasing stamina and endurance, as well as being a powerful mood booster.\nIf you are after a quick fix, then you might like to consider the Amazonian herb Guarana (Paullinia cupana). Guarana can help reduce physical and mental fatigue as well as improve metabolism. It contains a unique combination of natural stimulants and other active ingredients — but it is worth noting that it does contain caffeine. Guarana, coffee, tea, and chocolate should all be avoided if you wish to avoid caffeine. It is worth noting that the recommended daily dosage of guarana contains less caffeine than an ordinary cup of black tea.\nMany energy products contain guarana. However, I recommend either finding natural guarana powder and making your own healthy bliss balls and smoothies or taking it in capsule form. This is especially important if you want to avoid the flavouring, sugar, colouring, and additional caffeine often added to energy drinks.\nOne other herbal remedy without caffeine may help you avoid the afternoon slump. Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is typically taken as a tea and is reputed to stimulate brain function without interfering with sleep, burdening the adrenal glands, or disrupting your nervous system. It has a slightly bitter flavour.\nRead More Natural Health: What can I do about my flaking scalp?\nIrish Examiner’s WhatsApp channel\nFollow and share the latest news and stories\nwith\nSubscribe Now",

Y no nos cabe duda porque el artista se dejó la piel en su conquista.",
