    "text": "SOSHANGUVE residents receive title deeds. The City of Tshwane has taken a significant step towards empowering its citizens by handing over 197 title deeds to deserving beneficiaries in Soshanguve Extension 6, Ward 90, Pretoria. This milestone marks a major breakthrough in the city's quest to provide security and property ownership, unlocking the doors to economic empowerment, social mobility, and a brighter future for hundreds of families. During the handover ceremony on Wednesday, September 18, the city announced that it has successfully handed over a total of 2 311 title deeds in the area. In recent months, visits were conducted in other parts of Eersterust, Soshanguve, and Elandspoort to hand over title deeds. MMC for Human Settlement, Ofentse Madzebatela, said: \"As a city, we are proud to facilitate security of tenure for these beneficiaries and will continue to prioritise the handover of title deeds as we recognise the importance of giving ownership rights to beneficiaries.\" [ALSO READ: RINGA NATHI: She calls patients tokoloshes](https://www.snl24.com/dailysun/news/mzansi-speaks-out-hospital-horror-stories-and-healthcare-worker-struggles-20240919) She reminded residents that a title deed is a legal document and must be kept in a safe place as proof of ownership and for future reference. Madzebatela further emphasised the importance of protecting properties against fires, storms, and natural disasters. \"Residents must make protection arrangements with reliable, registered, and reputable insurance companies in the event of damage to their properties,\" she said. The city still has a large number of unclaimed title deeds due to difficulty locating some beneficiaries. \"Beneficiaries without title deeds are encouraged to visit local regional offices to enquire about the status of their documents,\" Madzebatela said. The handover of title deeds showcased the administration's dedication to safeguarding housing beneficiaries' property rights. Residents like Mmanoko Mabaso were overjoyed and expressed gratitude for the city's efforts in educating them on the importance and proper care of title deeds. \"I was unaware of its purpose, but now I understand,\" Mmanoko said. Michael Mokimisi, who inherited his parents' home, praised Legal Aid South Africa for helping him navigate the complex ownership transfer process. \"I faced a lot of challenges, even going to court to protect my family's home from unauthorised sale. I'm thrilled to have secured my title deed,\" said Michael. [this link](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaHB5ez7tkj0FuHQkQ0s)",

    "title": "Uchi, lauded Texas sushi bar with a cult following, just debuted its first L.A. location - Los Angeles Times",
    "text": "Uchi and Oheya A national sushi brand with a ravenous fandom just landed its first West Coast restaurant, launching in West Hollywood — with another L.A. sushi bar soon to follow.\nUchi, founded in 2003 by James Beard Foundation Award-winning chef Tyson Cole, sprouted from Austin before expanding to Miami, Denver, Dallas, Houston and beyond. Famed for intricate seasonal small plates and vegetarian offerings in addition to a range of sashimi, nigiri and daily specials, it’s the first of two flags to be planted in West Hollywood. Oheya, a high-end, 14-seat omakase restaurant, is slated for a 2024 opening in the same building.\n“It’s always been a dream of [Cole’s] to open a sushi place in Los Angeles,” said chef de cuisine Joel Hammond, who heads the kitchen at L.A. Uchi and Oheya. “Los Angeles is known to have some of the best sushi in the world. … We’re very, very humble in that we know we’ve got a lot of competition, but I think we’ll stand on our own. Uchi is very unique and its own thing.”\nAdvertisement Uchi’s fish is primarily sourced from Japan’s famed Toyosu Market, with some also from Europe, such as bluefin tuna from Spain, and others from New Zealand such as the Ora King found in nigiri, sashimi and with Spanish chorizo and brown-butter hollandaise. The kitchen prioritizes ocean sustainability, Hammond says.\nThe fish can be found throughout the omakase, as well as what they call the “somakase,” where the server builds an omakase out of their personal choices, plus a la carte small plates, nigiri and sashimi. A vegetarian omakase, a full vegetarian menu and vegan options also are on offer, and the space — all wood, low-lit and modern — seats nearly 200 across a sushi bar, the dining room, the cocktail bar, a patio and a private dining room.\nUchi is only the first Hai Hospitality restaurant to open in Los Angeles; a more intimate omakase bar is set to debut in early 2024. (Shelby Moore / Uchi) Unique to West Hollywood is the bar menu; most Uchi locations and offshoots offer a happy hour, but here, Hammond and the team hope to create an entirely different set of bar-only bites — such as fried pork belly over maitake chawanmushi, or beef tartare over house-made milk bread seared in rendered A5 Wagyu fat — that could be worthy of their own visit at any time.\nGiven the proximity to the coast and the Santa Monica Farmers Market, special dishes and other items unique to West Hollywood will feature highly seasonal ingredients, with some pitched by staff even outside of the kitchen.\n“The quality of goods is just unmatched out here,” Hammond said, “so that’s what we’re the most excited about.” Some include market vegetable tempura; market-squash gunkan; and a strawberry XO sauce devised in Houston that makes an appearance on a few items, including a seared scallop in vermouth butter and an heirloom tomato salad.\nBeverages include sakes and imported Japanese beers in addition to cocktails such as an umami-packed “dirty dashi”’ martini, an apricot-tinged Boulevardier, and a citrus Old-Fashioned featuring yuzu bitters. Uchi is open in West Hollywood from 5:30 to 10 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and from 5:30 to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.\n9001 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 101, West Hollywood, (310) 708-4808, uchi.uchirestaurants.com\nAdvertisement\nHeather Wong’s Chinatown bakery, Flouring, specializes in petal-topped cake bars in a range of colors and flavors. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times) Flouring A long-anticipated bakery featuring some of the city’s most stylish cakes and treats is set to open in Chinatown with a case full of flower-topped cake bars. Flouring, from Bottega Louie and Sweetsalt veteran Heather Wong, soft-opened, then closed, in December to test the business; on Jan. 13 it will reopen permanently after years of pop-ups and residencies.\nWong specializes in familiar flavors but with a twist, some with nods to her Chinese and Mexican heritage, such as the black sesame cake bar or the marranitos, or piggy cookies, which she makes with orange zest and piloncillo.\n“I just wanted something different,” she said. “It’s been a long time coming, actually, because I’ve been baking in L.A. for 13-plus years, baking for other people and opening bakeries for other people. It was all just to prepare me for my own space.”\nWong has been readying the space for more than two years, flipping a former storage unit and salon into a commercial bakery with a pint-size retail counter. In that counter are cake bars, pavlovas, s’mores bars, citrus shortbread cookies, meringue-topped brownies and more.\nHer signature cake bars are topped with a rainbow of edible, pesticide-free flower petals, and come in flavors such as ube coconut, passion fruit, cookies and cream, and lavender lemon marble. Whole cakes, equally aesthetically pleasing, can be purchased with at least a day’s advance notice, though some smaller versions will be available for walk-ins. Also available are baking items , including aprons, cake stands, piping bags, spatulas and edible coloring kits. Flouring opens Jan. 13 with hours of 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday to Sunday , with additional days and hours to be added in the future.\n932 N. Hill St., Los Angeles, (213) 266-8946, flouringla.com\nAt Little Fish’s new Echo Park outpost, breakfast, lunch, vegan pastries and a full coffee program add to the existing seafood-focused menu with new dishes such as fish congee, left. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times) Little Fish Echo Park and Dada Market One of L.A.’s most popular pop-up sandwiches just found a home in Echo Park with an expanded menu, pastries and a full coffee program. Anna Sonenshein and Niki Vahle began Little Fish, their seafood pop-up, during the pandemic. They’ve turned out countless beer-and-vodka-battered fish sandwiches over the years, first from their house, then with a residency at Smorgasburg and another at music venue and bar Checker Hall. This month they launched an indefinite residency within a new corner store, Dada Market, giving Little Fish a more permanent kitchen and picnic tables along Sunset Boulevard.\nHere, Little Fish’s breakfast menu is entirely new, with standouts such as fish congee and cottage cheese pancakes, the latter of which Vahle and Sonenshein both grew up eating. Stalwarts such as the whitefish salad and potatoes take on slightly new forms. The cult-status fried fish sandwich is available at lunch alongside a handful of new items such as a steak sandwich. A number of dishes likely will remain unique to the Echo Park location, even as Little Fish opens a Melrose Hill restaurant sometime next year.\nLittle Fish is now open inside Echo Park’s Dada Market. A location in Melrose Hill is set to open in 2024. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times) Sonenshein and Vahle also are using the new space to run a program that nearly eliminates food waste, especially when it comes to fish; smaller pieces not ideal for the sandwich are utilized in the fish congee, fish salad and the like, while the skin is dried and used as a garnish and the bones make seafood stock for the congee.\nAlso on offer are vegan pastries by Jen Yee of Baker’s Bench, available on weekends, and a coffee bar by Phill Kim, who also handmade the cafe’s ceramics. Inside Dada Market there are teas, oils, fruits, tinned fish, bottles of wine and other gourmet retail items, while its evening menu serves marinated olives, wedge salads, hamachi tostadas and more. The market is set to be a daytime anchor for two forthcoming restaurant and bar concepts located behind the shop, and serve as a space for collaborations and pop-ups like Little Fish.\n“We’ve never built a kitchen before, I’ve never worked in a kitchen,” Sonenshein said. “We’re counting ourselves so lucky to have a complete education in starting. We’ve been so fortunate with people being like, ‘Hey, come use our space and figure it out as you go,’ and it’s such a safety net that I can’t believe we’ve lucked into.”\nLittle Fish is open inside Dada Market from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday. Dada Market is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday.\n1606 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 947-3232, littlefishechopark.com/echo-park and dadaechopark.com\nMonterey Park’s Mama Lu Dumpling House expanded to Pasadena this year with its signature dumplings, plus family-style Chinese and Taiwanese dishes. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times) Mama Lu Dumpling House Pasadena A San Gabriel Valley staple of about two decades just expanded to Pasadena. Famed for its xiao long bao but offering an array of other fresh, handmade dumplings as well, Mama Lu Dumpling House specializes in Chinese and Taiwanese specialties including crystal chicken, beef rolls, Shanghai-style rice cakes, soups, braised meatballs and whole fish with preserved vegetables. The dumpling specialist recently took over the former Chef Tony Dim Sum space, which features two dining rooms in Old Pasadena. The menu more or less mirrors the offerings found in its sibling Mama Lu locations in Monterey Park and City of Industry (not to be confused with Mama Lu’s, which operates in San Gabriel Valley and Chinatown and is under separate ownership). Mama Lu Dumpling House is open in Pasadena from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday.\n2 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 803-0028, mamalutogo.com\nNam Coffee\nHollywood cafe Nam Coffee specializes in traditional and modern Vietnamese coffee concoctions, all made with Vietnam-grown coffee beans. (Stephanie Breijo / Los Angeles Times) After launching a coffee roastery out of his home in Anaheim nearly two years ago, Vince Nguyen has opened his first cafe and what he hopes will be a center for uplifting Vietnamese coffee culture. Nam Coffee is now open in East Hollywood, using only Vietnam-grown robusta and arabica beans and serving them as lattes, americanos, cappuccinos and flat whites, as well as specialty Vietnamese coffee drinks such as salted-cream coffees, coconut and purple yam cream coffees, shaken coffees with brown sugar and oat milk, classic condensed-milk coffees and more.\nThough Nguyen previously worked in fashion, he’s loved coffee since childhood and helped his mom operate her coffee cart in Ho Chi Minh City. After moving to the U.S. he noticed a lack of not only Vietnamese specialty drinks but also Vietnamese coffee that’s made traditionally, using a phin coffee filter.\n“It’s not only a coffee shop,” Nguyen said. “I want it to be a place for people to come and experience Vietnamese culture.”\nHe sources beans directly from coffee farms in Vietnam and for nearly two years has been supplying L.A. restaurants and shops such as Di Di, Sesame and Sara’s Market. His new cafe sells bags of his coffee beans as well as phin filters and other apparatus for home brewing. In the future Nguyen hopes to offer coffee workshops and, thanks to a partnership with nearby shop and restaurant Gingergrass Mini Mart , banh mi and other food items. Nam Coffee is open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday and Saturday.\n4876 Fountain Ave., Los Angeles, (323) 741-0222, nam.coffee\nFood\nAsk your barista!

All your coffee bean questions answered.\nFeb. 23, 2023\nCreamy Boys This month Creamy Boys, home to some of the best soft serve in L.A. , launched a bricks-and-mortar in the South Bay for pillowy swirls of New Zealand-style ice cream. Founder and New Zealander Duncan Parsons launched a roving operation in 2020 before business partner Joe Wedd joined in 2022, and since then they’ve brought freshly churned, almost whipped ice cream featuring fresh and frozen fruit to events such as Smorgasburg and a weekly residency at the Mar Vista Farmers Market.\nIn their first permanent ice cream shop — a pink-and-white walk-up window two blocks from the beach — the longtime friends are serving the fruit-forward New Zealand-style ice cream of their childhood alongside seasonal specials and another regional specialty, the Hokey Pokey, a textural wonderland that incorporates crunchy honeycomb candy into the ice cream, then tops it all with another crumble. What’s more, each flavor can be made using dairy or a house-made vegan tapioca base. The trucks will continue to roam in 2024. Creamy Boys is open in Hermosa Beach from noon to 11 p.m. Tuesday to Sunday.\n1136 Hermosa Ave., Hermosa Beach, (424) 400-1372, creamyboys.com\nCreamy Boys, already a weekly staple at the Mar Vista Farmers Market, now brings New Zealand-style whipped soft serve-like ice cream to a new shop.

Las [lluvias van a ser protagonistas en la noche-madrugada del Domingo de Ramos al Lunes Santo](https://www.elespanol.com/malaga/cultura/cofradias/20240321/aemet-da-segura-lluvia-lunes-santo-malaga-guarda-prudencia-horas-intensidad/841665863_0.html), así como la práctica totalidad de esta última jornada, lo que puede afectar de lleno al recorrido y a la salida de las cofradías que tienen previsto procesionar esos días. Este es la última previsión que hace la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) a pocas horas del inicio de la Semana Santa, La noticia, que ya se venía apuntando desde hace días, supone un jarro de agua fría, especialmente, para las hermandades del Lunes Santo, entre las que adquiere un protagonismo especial El Cautivo, al tiempo que siembra de incertidumbre a aquellas que estén recorriendo las calles de la capital de la Costa del Sol en la noche en la madrugada del lunes. \"Conforme avance la madrugada del lunes aumenta la probabilidad de lluvia\", afirma Jesús Riesco, el director del Centro Meteorológico de Málaga. Los datos dejan poco lugar a la duda y confirman el Lunes Santo, en la práctica totalidad de la provincia y durante casi toda la jornada, habrá precipitaciones \"bastante persistentes\". \"Es el día más complicado\", confirma Riesco en relación con las cofradías. Pero no es el único día en que la lluvia puede ser protagonista. El Martes Santo continuará la inestabilidad, pero es cierto que \"aumenta la incertidumbre\". \"Nos llega la otra depresión del norte que puede afectar al martes y el miércoles\", explica. Con los datos en la mano, el Domingo de Ramos, a priori, transcurrirá con normalidad durante la primera parte del día. Sin embargo, al final de la jornada puede caer algo un chubasco \"disperso\", que puede estar acompañado de barro. Conforme a la información disponible en este momento, que habrá que ir puliendo con el paso de las horas, el Jueves Santo es el día menos amenazado por la meteorología. De hecho, Riesco admite de manera prudente que al final de la Semana Santa podría entrar en la Península una nueva borrasca, cuyo impacto sobre la provincia aún se ignora con precisión. Más allá de la incidencia evidente que esta información tiene sobre la Semana Santa, tanto este viernes como mañana sábado se mantiene la previsión de [calima](https://www.elespanol.com/malaga/20240321/cielo-tine-naranja-calima-ataca-nuevo-malaga-anos-despues-gran-ola-barro/841666228_0.html), aunque sin precipitaciones. Los termómetros siguen con temperaturas muy por encima de lo normal.",

    "text": "Australia won the Boxing Day Test on Friday Pat Cummins single-handedly skittled Pakistan But there was controversy around one dismissal\nPat Cummins’ second 10-wicket haul in Tests has powered Australia to a thrilling 79-run win over Pakistan at the MCG.\nThe Australia captain made all the crucial breakthroughs late on Friday as the hosts bowled Pakistan out for 237 to win the Boxing Day Test.\nPakistan fought bravely but lost 5-18 during a chaotic finish to day four as Australia took the extra 30 minutes after the scheduled stumps to complete the victory and retain the Benaud-Qadir trophy.\nCummins finished with match figures of 10-97 after taking 5-49 in the second innings.\nMohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha threatened to push Pakistan towards a famous win and break a 28-year winless run in Tests in Australia.\nAustralia have defeated Pakistan to gain an unassailable lead in their three-match series\nPat Cummins took an incredible 10-wicket haul to win the Test at the MCG\nCummins ended the 67-run partnership between the pair in bizarre and dramatic fashion just 15 minutes before the scheduled close of play.\nAustralia reviewed a not out call to Rizwan as a Cummins delivery flew into Alex Carey’s gloves.\nBut after a long review from the third umpire, Richard Illingworth deemed the ball flicked Rizwan’s wrist band that was connected to his gloves.\nRizwan was the furious with the decision, with Pakistan 5-219 at the time and starting to believe they could pull off the country’s highest successful winning chase against Australia.\n‘I got a little bit twitchy there,’ Cummins said.\n‘I felt OK but they were batting nicely. Happy with the Rizwan wicket.’\nIt was Cummins who stood up earlier, claiming the crucial wicket of his opposing captain Shan Masood (60), before tea.\nCummins took his fourth of the second innings just minutes later, dismissing Aamir Jamal (0).\nThe wickets earned him the Jonny Mullagh Medal for player of the match, made him the 10th Australian to pass 250 Test scalps and capped a superb year as captain.\nAt seven wickets down, Australia opted to take the extra 30 minutes in a bid to complete the match on Friday instead of coming back for day five.\nBut Pakistan were left fuming over Mohammad Rizwan’s controversial dismissal\nPat Cummins’s role in the victory caps off a perfect year for the Australia captain\nIt was a rollicking end to one of the great MCG Tests, with Pakistan fighting harder than many touring nations usually do on Australian soil.\nEarlier in the day, Pakistan star Babar Azam looked about to explode after a difficult start to the series.\nBut on 41, the former skipper was bowled by another classic delivery – this time by Josh Hazlewood.\nBabar’s stumps were rattled in the first innings by Cummins, who produced a seaming ‘dream ball’, and Hazlewood’s wicket was just as good.\n‘The game kept turning. Sometimes it went Australia’s way, sometimes ours,’ Masood said.\n‘But when we were leading with bat when me and Abdullah had a good partnership (in the first innings), Pat Cummins came in with that spell.\n‘And that is why he is one of the best bowlers in the world.’",

O IPMA salienta a precipitação forte registada no período de 14 a 16, em especial na região Sul no dia 16 e em particular no interior do Baixo Alentejo e o Algarve, onde ocorreram inundações em algumas localidades. O boletim dá também conta que se verificou uma diminuição da área em seca meteorológica na região Sul, cingindo-se apenas à região litoral Sul entre Sines e Portimão. No final de novembro apenas 8 % do território estava em seca meteorológica (classe de seca fraca). A nível mundial, a temperatura média foi de 14,10 graus, mais 0,70 do que o valor médio entre 1991 e 2020. \"Estima-se que o mês tenha sido cerca de 1,62 °C mais quente do que a média pré-industrial de 1850-1900, e é o 16º mês num período de 17 meses em que a temperatura do ar da superfície média global excedeu 1,5°\" graus\", referiu o IPMA, em comunicado Na Europa, o valor médio da temperatura média do ar foi 5,14 °C, + 0,78 °C do que o valor médio 1991-2020. As temperaturas do ar estiveram acima da média (1991-2020) no norte da Rússia e registaram-se recordes de temperatura em Kirkenes, no Ártico da Noruega. A Dinamarca teve a noite mais quente para o mês de novembro e a Islândia também estabeleceu um recorde para a noite mais quente de novembro em qualquer lugar acima da latitude 60°: 22,9°C. Nas regiões do sudoeste da Europa, as temperaturas do ar estiveram igualmente acima da média, com temperaturas noturnas extremas registadas em França no final do mês. \"Em contraste, o Leste e o Sul da Europa e a Turquia registaram temperaturas abaixo da média, tal como algumas partes de Itália\", observaram os técnicos.
