    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Gloucester County, Virginia from 1901-2000 was 40.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Gloucester County, Virginia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Gloucester County, Virginia history.",

    "text": "Cold snaps could worsen springtime allergies The cold, dry air can cause nasal tissue swelling. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The quick spells of colder air may seem like a sigh of relief for allergy sufferers, but doctors say it could actually do more harm to your nasal passages, creating worse-feeling allergies this time of year. It’s not uncommon to get cold snaps of overnight low temperatures falling to around freezing in mid-March here in Middle Tennessee. In fact, our last average freeze is around April 1st. But while the cold air does help lower the pollen count, it can be counterproductive to our bodies preventing those allergies by increasing nasal tissue swelling. This can create an increase in drainage, congestion and sneezing. Doctors say the best way to prevent worsening allergies in the midst of these cold snaps is to limit your exposure outside, especially in the evening once the temperature begins to drop. The cold, dry air is the cause of nasal tissue swelling. Sleeping with a humidifier can also help combat the dry air you’re breathing in. Copyright 2024 WSMV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "The Brief A group of MSU students have created lightweight shoelaces that won't come untied and are stronger than steel. The company is called BRCĒ and a single knot can pull a 6,000-pound truck, the founders say. The students said they learned how to form their company from watching \"Sharktank\" episodes. FOX 2 - A company comprised entirely of college students is riding a wave of success thanks to some ingenuity and inspiration.\nIn just a matter of months, they have gone from relative unknowns to pitching their business to international investors.\nIt is remarkable how fast a group of Michigan State University students have gone from an idea to developing a business - then taking a product to market.\nThe backstory:\n\"This grip will not come untied whatsoever and this single knot can pull a 6,000-pound truck,\" said Madhav Aggarwal. \"We make hybrid composites and materials that are stronger than steel, lightweight and fire-resistant. We have invented the world's first shoelaces that never come untied due to activity, weather, or fray.\"\nAggarwal and Tanvi Gadamsetti are a pair of MSU juniors and business partners, the driving force behind the company BRCĒ.\n\"Athletic shoelaces that never come untied - we make them for different sports with different benefits,\" he said.\nThey met as freshmen.\n\"It was my first year in a foreign country and first year at Michigan State, so the goal was to stand out,\" Aggarwal said.\nThey bonded over a common problem. Both are former athletes who suffered injuries caused by knots that refused to stay tied.\n\"We realized that if they come untied for me then they must also come untied for a pro athlete,\" Aggarwal said.\n\"(We thought) 'Hey, this is what's wrong, someone needs to fix it and let's be the people to fix it,\" said Gadamsetti. \"And luckily we have the education background.\"\nAnd with that, BRCĒ was born, and it grew up fast. Within 45 days of addressing a problem they designed a solution - micro velcro shoe laces.\n\"We actually launched at Sneakercon Detroit during the NFL Draft. on April 27th. that was the first time that we put our product into the world and we sold out within just 4 hours,\" said Gadamsetti.\nThey patented their product soon after. All of this business know-how came from what they saw on the TV show \"Shark Tank.\"\n\"My first job after coming back from school would be to turn on the TV and watch those free episodes,\" Aggarwal said.\nFrom there they jumped at every chance they could to pitch their business.\n\"We knew we had to go to market, and make money so we can again put that back into the business and that’s all we knew at that point,\" said Gadamsetti.\n\"And we had a story to tell which is extremely important with physical products,\" said Aggarwal.\nNot to mention, possibly make a little prize money along the way.\n\"To date we’ve done a couple dozen pitch competitions now?\" Aggarwal said.\nFOX 2: \"How do you hear of these?\"\n\"A lot of sleuthing on the internet to be completely transparent,\" Gadamsetti said. \"I have this Excel sheet of every pitch competition we can find.\"\nTheir pace of success and growth has been astounding. They’ve been pitching the business for just four months.\nFOX 2 first met them back in January, when they won a competition in Troy.\n\"We are on a 97 percent win rate,\" Aggarwal said. \"So we won in Michigan, in the Midwest, in the country and now internationally.\"\nFresh off a win in Mexico, they are still learning that winning can be a subjective term.\n\"Its not really a win until you've found customers.\" Aggarwal said.\nWhich is why they are setting their sights even higher.\n\"What used to be just shoelaces we can now make an entire shoe out of,\" he said.\nYou can track their progress and their products at BRCĒ online HERE.\nAll seven members of the company are MSU students and former athletes.\nThe Source: The information for this story is from an interview with two of the BRCĒ company founders.",

Pastor Adeboye on Olugbon's throne: Nigerians react A popular Nigerian politician, Lere Olayinka, [ posted one of the photos](https://web.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10224635113290189&set=a.1621764948936) on Facebook with the caption: \"Pastor Adeboye takes the throne of Olugbon of Orile Igbon.\" Bayour Salami commented: \"I think the town kingmaker should remove this Oba and his counterparts at Ogbomosho. They are a disgrace of Obaship in Yorubaland.\" Olúwo Jogbodo Orunmila, @animolenikun, said: \"Everyone keeps tagging me to these photos. My stand on this is that Baba Adeboye is doing this intentionally to ridicule the Yoruba Obaship. \"If you feel disgusted about it as Omoluabi this is time for you to speak up. This is an abomination.\" Man of Letters, @Letter_to_Jack, said: \"The other day when I said he should know better, his people came for me. Pastor Adeboye being a Yoruba man gotta know that this is wrong. But he doesn’t care.\" Abiola Nofisat, @AbiolaNofisat2, said: \"You all blaming Baba Adeboye, I am sure he didn’t ask to sit on the throne, the king probably did not realize his authority. Imagine first class o as like Ooni, Alaafin, Awujale sitting on plastic chairs for their pastors or Imam.\" DIGUN the bald man, @the_utty, said: \"This is so shameful. He is a Yoruba elderly man. He knows the culture. It makes no sense & it's disrespectful for him to sit on the throne of an Oba.\" Soun of Ogbomoso kneels before Pastor Adeboye In a similar development, Nigerians recently [ reacted to a photo ](https://www.legit.ng/people/1569326-shouldnt-knelt-man-reacts-photo-pastor-adeboye-praying-soun-ogbomoso/)showing Pastor Adeboye praying for the new Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Ghandi Olaoye. In the photo, the monarch knelt before the respected man of God to receive prayers. Some people found this improper for a monarch, insisting that the Oba should not have knelt before the pastor.

    "title": "Victoria goes to court to ban company from managing Airbnbs anywhere in city | CBC News",
    "text": "The City of Victoria is going to court to permanently ban a local property management company from running short-term rentals anywhere in the city, claiming the business has been advertising and operating Airbnbs in a popular area of the downtown core without the proper licences.\nCourt documents say Amala Vacation Rental Solutions and its CEO are still managing four condos — all within a few blocks of each other in the heart of the provincial capital's tourist area — as short-term Airbnbs without permission, despite having been written more than a dozen tickets over the years.\nThe alleged violations \"demonstrate that the respondents are unwilling to refrain from the unlawful acts and are a clear case of flouting the City's bylaws,\" read one of four petitions filed in B.C. Supreme Court on Wednesday.\nThe filings are the latest legal fights over short-term rental laws in B.C. Amala's CEO, Angela Mason, is one of hundreds of property owners and managers currently taking the provincial government to court over new laws which they say could ruin their businesses.\nDowntown hotspot The city's court documents list four Airbnbs: a studio on Pandora Avenue, a two-bedroom condo on Herald Street and a pair of one-bedroom condos on Yates Street and Fisgard Street. They're within roughly one kilometre of each other; two are across an alley from each other.\nThe area is a hotspot for visitors, packed with shops, bookstores, restaurants and cocktail bars within walking distance of landmarks like the Inner Harbour and the B.C. Legislature.\nAmala, which Mason founded in 2016, manages short-term rentals for property owners in the downtown Victoria area. The company did not immediately respond to calls for comment from CBC News.\nShort-term rentals, like those listed on Airbnb or Vrbo, have been restricted under Victoria bylaws since 2018. Property owners can't rent homes for fewer than 30 days without a short-term rental licence from the city.\nThe city's court documents say Amala does not have licences for the four downtown condos — plus, the city say they are in a zoning area that doesn't allow any short-term rentals.\nThe city says it has been trying to teach Amala about its rules since around 2020. Its petitions say Mason signed a letter in September admitting she'd broken the bylaws after the city wrote her more than a dozen tickets that spring, but that the four properties are still advertised on Airbnb.\nVancouver Airbnb host pays $6K in business licence fines They want to set up a fully accessible Airbnb. Right now, a bylaw means they can't The city is asking for a court order permanently banning Amala from running the condos — or any other homes, anywhere in the city — as short-term rentals. It's also asking for a court order giving city employees the right to go into the condos for daytime inspections for two years, so long as they give the owners a day's notice.\nThe city declined further comment.\nFight with the province On top of the case with the city, Mason is also challenging a new B.C. law restricting short-term rentals to a homeowner's principal residence. It means short-term rentals, like those offered on Airbnb, have to be within a host's home, or a basement suite or laneway home on the property.\nThe Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act took effect on May 1 and applies in more than 60 communities across the province.\nWATCH | Property owners seek compensation: Property owners seek judicial review of new short-term rental rules\n2 months ago Duration 1:27 A group of property owners offering short-term rentals is seeking a judicial review into new provincial rules. As Meera Bains reports, they also want final compensation and a court injunction to delay enforcement of new regulations limiting short-term rentals. The government says the law is meant to stop short-term rentals from \"taking away homes people need.\" In an interview last winter, Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon said Airbnb property managers should find new jobs .\nMason, Amala and the West Coast Association for Property Rights filed a petition against the law in April; asking a judge to decide whether the province had the authority to pass the act.\nIn the filing, Amala said it had laid off more than half of its previous 32 employees and cut seven contractors by April because of the new rules announced in October. The company said the number of short-term rentals under its management had dropped by a quarter, down from 90 to 65.",
