    "title": "Rising Tennis Star Joao Fonseca Teams Up with Renowned Coach Franco Davin for Career Boost",
    "text": "At the tender age of 18, Joao Fonseca has made an impressive splash in the tennis world. Already boasting an ATP Tour title and an impactful Grand Slam debut in Australia under his belt, this world-ranking number 60 player is setting his sights on higher ground. His recent collaboration with acclaimed coach Franco Davin during the Miami Open could signal his intent to ascend further.\nFonseca, who burst onto the tennis scene in 2025 with victories at the Argentina Open and two Challenger titles, now collaborates with Davin, a seasoned mentor known for his guidance of Juan Martin del Potro to the 2009 US Open title. The young Brazilian, currently at a career-high ranking of No. 60, is hoping to leverage Davin’s knowledge to catapult him to the top.\nDavin, originally from Argentina, has been seen practicing with Fonseca’s team at the Miami Open. He was personally hired as a paid consultant by Fonseca’s regular coach, Guilherme Teixeira, following a season of free advice in 2024.\nTeixeira expressed his gratitude for Davin’s involvement, stating, “In 2024, I benefited so much from it, and he offered me everything for free, that I felt a bit awkward”. Fondly referring to his frequent consultation with Davin as ‘bothering’, Teixeira stated that he prefers to pay Davin to ensure that he can continue to seek his advice freely.\nTeixeira emphasized the great synergy between him and Davin, and the importance of respecting Fonseca’s opinions. He noted that Fonseca was very comfortable with the arrangement and that their earlier time together in Miami was both relaxed and productive.\nThis partnership is not a one-off, as Teixeira confirmed that Davin would continue to work with Fonseca beyond the Miami Open. He also mentioned that Davin, a Miami resident, would be joining them in Rio for the clay court season preparations.\nDavin’s impressive resume includes coaching former world No. 3 Del Potro, and guiding him to victory against Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the 2009 US Open. His portfolio also includes a stint with Grigor Dimitrov and leading Fabio Fognini’s team to a Monte Carlo Masters title.\nFonseca, whose powerful forehand has drawn comparisons to Del Potro, has been praised by former world No. 4 Kei Nishikori, who stated, “I’m very, very curious about him. His forehand speed is excellent. It’s a bit different from Del Potro, but it’s similar.”\nBy winning the title in Phoenix, Fonseca joined the ranks of Del Potro and Guillermo Coria as the third South American player to win three Challengers before the age of 19.\nAs the Miami Open progresses, all eyes will be on the rematch between Fonseca and fellow teen sensation Learner Tien, a replay of the Next Gen ATP Finals final from December, which Fonseca won. With the added mentorship of Davin, Fonseca is poised to make an even bigger impact in the world of tennis.",

    "text": "16:50\nNews Story\nBiden administration sanctions ‘extremist’ Israeli settlers in West Bank\nPresident Joe Biden on Feb. 1, 2024, signed an executive order sanctioning Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Biden is shown speaking in the South Court Auditorium at the White House complex on Feb. 16, 2023. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nPresident Joe Biden sanctioned four Israeli settlers in the West Bank on Thursday, part of an administration effort to curb civilian casualties in the region as Israel’s war with Hamas continues.\nBiden signed an\nexecutive order authorizing financial sanctions that can be applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who engage in acts of violence on the West Bank, a Palestinian territory on the Jordan River occupied by Israel. But the first four individuals designated under the order were Israeli settlers accused of violence against Palestinians and Biden made clear “extremist settler violence” motivated the move.\n“I have issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to deal with the threat posed by the situation in the West Bank, including in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction,” he wrote in a message to Congress accompanying the order.\n“Such actions constitute a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region and undermine the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States,” Biden continued.\nThe United States supports a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, which settler activity in the West Bank threatens, he said. Violence in the area also threatens Israeli security and U.S. personnel and interests and could lead to “broader regional destabilization,” he wrote.\nFreeze on U.S.-based assets\nThe order is similar to other sanctions that aim to block access to the U.S. financial system, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. Two senior administration officials briefed reporters on details of the order Thursday on the condition they not be named.\nThe order freezes any U.S.-based assets of designated individuals and blocks anyone in the U.S. from sending money or other services to the listed individuals.\nAn initial State Department\n list Thursday named four Israeli settlers who were subject to the sanctions.\nThe State Department accused the individuals of inciting and leading a riot, which caused the death of a Palestinian civilian, assaulting Palestinian farmers and Israeli peace activists, and “creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank.”\nWhite House Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to a Biden campaign event in Michigan that the order was part of a longstanding commitment to peace in the region.\n“It’s a signal to the whole world how seriously President Biden takes this settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank,” Kirby said, according to audio provided by the White House press pool.\n“He’s been very, very clear on that for a long, long time. It’s got to stop. It’s unacceptable. It’s a detriment to peace and security, certainly there in the West Bank and to the Palestinian people in general.”\nIsraeli government officials were given advance notice of the order, Kirby said. Government officials are not intended targets of sanctions, Kirby said.\nPressure from progressives\nThe order comes amid pressure from progressive activists for the Biden administration to work to end the war that erupted after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\nWhile Biden administration officials have affirmed Israel’s right to respond to the attack, they have increasingly demanded more attention to minimizing civilian casualties.\n“Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a\nThursday news release on the sanctions.\n“The United States will continue to take actions to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution, and is committed to the safety, security, and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\nWhile the initial targets of the order were Israeli, a senior administration on the press call said the order is “non-discriminatory” and could be applied to “Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\n ",
