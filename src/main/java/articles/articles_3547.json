The aggregate data will allow the company to focus on perfecting a final drug product to move into commercialization.\nStory continues Ensysce Biosciences announced approximately $1.1 million of registered direct offering in March by issuing 315,188 shares at $3.49 per share .\nPrice Action: ENSC stock is up 96.30% at $3.67 on Wednesday.\nRead Next:\nRezolute ‘Thrilled’ With Positive Review Of Genetic Disorder Trial, Expects Topline Results In December\nPhoto by Gorodenkoff via Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "title": "How Apple's iconic products reshaped everyday life: A look back at decades of innovation | FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth",
    "text": "Full episode: Apple's biggest product releases through the years Apple’s marketing machine is almost as effective as its skilled engineers. In this LiveNOW & Then episode, we look back at how the media has covered the tech company, from its IPO in 1980 to its iconic status today.\nApple products have reached a certain stratosphere among consumers, a level that&apos;s enviable and somewhat unattainable by other technology firms.\nWhen Apple pushes a product, consumers immediately flock to stores to grab it – so much so that crowds attract media attention. It&apos;s not only because of their design, but how Apple products have seemingly revolutionized everyday life.\nTimeline:\nHere&apos;s a look at the list of Apple products through the decades and how they transformed daily life:\nJune 1977, the Apple II From the archives: Apple Computer's 1980 IPO Apple went public back on December 12, 1980. Here's a look back at KTVU-TV's coverage of the event, along with a look at how Apple II computers were being used in the classroom -- a novelty at the time.\nThe Apple II was an improved version of the Apple I computer kit, and started the boom in personal computer sales, according to the National Museum of American History .\nIt was also the first computer to be widely used in schools across the U.S. For millions of today&apos;s adults, their first experience with a computer of any kind came with a version of the Apple II in their classroom – often playing Oregon Trail, Carmen Sandiego, or Odell Lake.\nJanuary 1984, the Macintosh Computer Apple Macintosh computer in 1984 (Credit: KTTV)\nHeralded by a now-most famous TV commercial , the Macintosh computer lived up to the revolutionary promise made by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs during its 1984 unveiling. Among other things, the Mac ushered in the era of the graphical user interface (known as \"GUI\" in tech parlance) and the mouse.\nIn many ways, it was the first realization of Jobs’ vision to turn computers into \"a bicycle of the mind.\"\nAugust 1998, the iMac From the archives: Reviewing the iMac in 1999 We now know Apple's all-in-one iMac marked an important milestone for the company. But what did people think of the colorful computer back when it debuted? Here's a look at FOX 2 Detroit's hands-on review of the iMac. Originally aired December 20, 1999.\nApple redesigned the desktop computer when it released the iMac. The all-in-one colorful egg stood out in bright contrast to the beige, rectangular PCs that Apple was competing with, and was one of the first products that helped rebrand Apple as a hip alternative for a new generation.\nFrom a technical perspective, it was the first mainstream computer that did not include the traditional floppy disk drive. Instead, it was an early adopter of the USB port.\nOctober 2001, the iPod Although it wasn’t the first of its kind, the iPod changed the way people thought about digital music players just like Jimi Hendrix changed the way people thought about the guitar.\nThe iPod was compact, stylish, and initially capable of storing up to 1,000 songs (the capacity would extend far beyond that of the first model in 2001).\nApple Computer Inc. unveiled a new portable music player, the iPod MP3 music player October 23, 2001 at an event in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo Courtesy of Apple Corp. via Getty Images)\nExpand It then spawned the iTunes store, which provided a legal way to buy and download music at a time of rampant MP3 piracy. The device also signaled Apple might evolve into something more than a computer maker.\nJanuary 2007, the iPhone A customer walks into the new Apple store holding a picture of Tim Cook as she is welcomed by the store staff at the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) on June 22, 2024, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.(Photo by Annice Lyn/Getty Images)\nIt’s difficult to overstate how much the iPhone has changed the world. In technical terms, it introduced the convenience of touchscreens at the time that a physical keyboard was still all the rage on the top-selling smartphone – the BlackBerry – when Jobs first took out what was all-in-one computer, camera and music player out of his pocket in 2007.\nA year later, Apple would open a store that would make it common to think there must be an app for just about anything, render the BlackBerry obsolete and make smartphones indispensable.\nRELATED: Apple reportedly working on foldable and thinner iPhone models\nSeptember 2014, the Apple Watch The Apple Watch created a device that made it possible to wear something akin to a smartphone on your wrist because it included cellular capability.\nIt also offered some of the same apps people use on their smartphones. Apple initially marketed its smartwatch almost like a fashion accessory before pivoting once it realized that its fitness and health-tracking features were the tools that people seemed to find most valuable.\nApple announces new AI features for iPhone, Mac Artificial intelligence expert Phil Siegel joins LiveNOW's Andrew Craft to discuss Apple's new AI features for its products.\nRELATED: Watch: Apple Watch SOS alert leads rescuers to injured skiers after 1,000-foot fall\nSeptember 2016, Airpods The AirPods helped popularize wireless headphones with an Apple chip that provided more reliable and stable connections with devices while making it easy to shift from one gadget to another.\nThe product also served another key purpose for Apple: AirPods quickly muted the initial outrage of the company’s decision to remove the headphone jack from iPhones in 2016 while creating another lucrative sales channel.\nApple's influence on generations Big picture view:\nApple has a long history of designing products that aren’t the first to be introduced in a particular category but still redefine the market.\nFOX 4&apos;s Steve Noviello has covered consumer products and said Apple has garnered a brand loyalty that none of its competitors have achieved, even though they push similar products.\n\"I use my iPhone or really any phone at this point to make payments,\" he said in an interview with FOX Television Stations. \"I pay my mortgage on it. I book my airline travel. I send pictures, I take pictures, I communicate with people. It monitors my heart health.\n\"I mean, it really is amazing what technology has done,\" he continued.",

    "title": "El papa Francesc ingressa a l'hospital per una bronquitis",
    "text": "Religió\nEl papa Francesc ingressa a l’hospital per una bronquitis\nEl Pontífex és a l’Agostino Gemelli de Roma per sotmetre’s a uns quants exàmens especialitzats i començar el tractament.\n‘La Repubblica’ va publicar que s’estarà al centre sanitari durant cinc dies\nEl Papa va ser ingressat ahir a l’hospital Gemelli de Roma. D’acord amb l’oficina de premsa del Vaticà, el motiu de l’hospitalització del Pontífex és una \"infecció en les vies respiratòries\" a causa d’una bronquitis i una \"lleu febre\". Francesc \"s’ha sotmès a exàmens especialitzats i ha començat una teràpia farmacològica hospitalària\".\nEl Vaticà no va informar sobre quant temps es mantindrà ingressat a la desena planta de l’hospital romà, on se sol allotjar. De moment, la Santa Seu només ha explicat que s’ha suspès la seva presència en tres actes fins dilluns, quan tenia prevista una trobada amb artistes que finalment ha sigut cancel·lada.\nAixí mateix, s’ha anul·lat l’audiència jubilar d’avui i una missa programada per demà diumenge –en la qual havia de ser present–, que presidirà el cardenal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefecte (ministre) del Dicasteri per a la Cultura i l’Educació. Tot i així, el Papa està \"tranquil i animat\" i va llegir \"uns quants diaris\", segons va comunicar el portaveu Matteo Bruni.\nUna conseqüència immediata d’aquest nou sotrac del Papa ha sigut també que l’oficina de premsa vaticana anunciés que les seves oficines es mantindrien obertes, de manera excepcional, durant tot ahir a la tarda. Una cosa que també remet a la gran atenció mediàtica i a les especulacions que la notícia ha posat en marxa arreu del món. El diari italià La Repubblica, per exemple, va publicar que fonts pròximes al Papa parlen d’un ingrés de cinc dies.\n\"He vist el Papa mentalment alerta però que tenia moltes dificultats per parlar a causa dels problemes respiratoris\", va dir, per la seva banda, Christopher Lamb, corresponsal de la CNN al Vaticà, després d’assistir al matí a una audiència que Francesc va mantenir amb Mark Thompson, president d’aquesta cadena. Lamb va confirmar d’aquesta manera el que molts vaticanistes han estat assenyalant durant els últims dies: l’aspecte cansat del Papa i la cara inflada, probablement a causa de la cortisona que li han administrat per combatre la infecció respiratòria.\nUna grip forta\nNotícies relacionadesDe fet, l’estat de salut de Francesc, de 88 anys i que arrossega diverses patologies, ha tornat a causar preocupació durant els últims 10 dies. Els primers rumors sobre la nova indisposició que ha tingut el Papa ja van sorgir la setmana passada, quan el Pontífex va començar a manifestar en públic els primers símptomes d’una grip forta. Tot i així, diumenge passat, va voler presidir una missa a la plaça de Sant Pere, en ocasió del jubileu de les Forces Armades, durant la qual finalment ell mateix va confessar que tenia \"dificultats a l’hora de respirar\".\nPosteriorment, dimecres, el Papa va demanar en l’últim moment que un sacerdot llegís en lloc seu el discurs durant el tradicional àngelus que es porta a terme aquell dia. \"Deixin-me demanar al pare que continuï llegint perquè encara no puc amb la bronquitis que arrossego. Espero que la pròxima vegada pugui fer-ho\", es va justificar llavors.",

    "title": "WATCH: Donovan Ferreira takes a 'Superman-Esque' catch to dismiss Senuran Muthusamy in the SA20 2025",
    "text": "In an exciting moment during Match 10 of the SA20 2025 tournament between Joburg Super Kings and Pretoria Capitals, Donovan Ferreira delivered a fielding masterclass with a breathtaking “Superman-esque” catch.\nDonovan Ferreira’s stunning catch in SA20 2025\nWith Pretoria reeling at 131/8 in the 20th over, Senuran Muthusamy looked to counterattack by launching a length delivery from Hardus Viljoen straight down the ground. The shot seemed destined to clear the fielder, with just enough height and power to evade any attempt. However, Donovan Ferreira had other plans. In a moment of sheer brilliance, Ferreira anticipated the trajectory, turned sharply, and executed an extraordinary leap, extending his hand mid-air to snatch the ball with precision. This exceptional display of athleticism not only dismissed Muthusamy for 8 but also highlighted the pivotal role of sharp fielding in T20 cricket. Ferreira’s moment of brilliance left fans and commentators in awe, emphasizing the impact of game-changing efforts in tight contests.\nHere’s the video:\nJoburg Super Kings +Spectacular One-handed catches = same whatsapp group 🤞\n[#BetwaySA20][#JSKvPC][#WelcomeToIncredible][pic.twitter.com/oVZ9TFYxEH]— Betway SA20 (@SA20_League)\n[January 16, 2025]\nAlso WATCH: Dinesh Karthik’s innings cut short by a bizarre run-out in SA20 2025\nRain-interrupted as Pretoria Capitals post 138/8 against Joburg Super Kings\nThe 10th match at The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, saw an eventful first innings After opting to bat, Capitals faced early setbacks with Rahmanullah Gurbaz dismissed for a duck and Will Jacks falling for 15, reducing them to 48/2 within six overs. Kyle Verreynne anchored the innings with a well-crafted 39 off 31 balls, but his dismissal just before the halfway mark triggered a middle-order collapse.\nRilee Rossouw, Liam Livingstone and Marques Ackerman struggled against disciplined bowling led by Moeen Ali, who claimed 2/21 in his four overs. Ferreira’s all-round brilliance shone through as he dismissed Gurbaz and Neesham, while also taking a spectacular catch to remove Muthusamy in the penultimate over. James Neesham’s quickfire 30 off 21 provided a late surge, helping the Capitals reach a modest total of 138/8. The Super Kings’ bowlers, including Imran Tahir (1/17) and Evan Jones (1/3), exploited the conditions effectively, keeping the scoring rate in check throughout. As rain continues to hover, the Super Kings will eye a controlled chase to secure their campaign momentum.",

    "text": "El uso excesivo de ambientadores en el hogar puede acarrear serias repercusiones para la salud, según advierte la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés). Estos productos, que a menudo se utilizan para mejorar el olor del ambiente, contienen compuestos químicos que pueden afectar negativamente la salud respiratoria y general de los habitantes.De acuerdo con la FDA, muchos ambientadores contienen ftalatos, que son sustancias químicas utilizadas para prolongar la fragancia de los productos. Estos ftalatos han sido asociados con problemas endocrinos y reproductivos, y su exposición prolongada puede contribuir a condiciones como el asma y otras enfermedades respiratorias. La Agencia de Protección Ambiental (EPA) también ha señalado que los ambientadores pueden liberar compuestos orgánicos volátiles (COV), que al ser inhalados pueden irritar los ojos, la piel y las vías respiratorias.Según el Instituto Nacional de Seguridad y Salud Ocupacional (NIOSH) de los Estados Unidos, los síntomas más comunes de la exposición a estos compuestos incluyen dolores de cabeza, náuseas y dificultad para respirar. La NIOSH sugiere que el uso excesivo de ambientadores puede aumentar el riesgo de desarrollar enfermedades respiratorias crónicas, especialmente en personas con condiciones preexistentes como el asma.La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) también ha expresado preocupaciones sobre los efectos de los productos de fragancia en la salud pública. En un informe reciente, la OMS destacó que la exposición continua a los químicos presentes en los ambientadores puede tener efectos adversos en el bienestar general, particularmente en niños y personas con sistemas inmunitarios comprometidos.Para minimizar los riesgos asociados con el uso de ambientadores, los expertos sugieren adoptar varias estrategias preventivas. En primer lugar, se recomienda reducir la frecuencia y cantidad de ambientadores utilizados en el hogar. Esto puede incluir la limitación de los productos con fragancia y la búsqueda de alternativas más naturales que no comprometan la calidad del aire interior. Una de las opciones más efectivas es mejorar la ventilación de los espacios mediante la apertura de ventanas y el uso de ventiladores , lo cual ayuda a diluir y eliminar los contaminantes presentes en el aire.Otra medida importante es optar por productos sin fragancia y evitar aquellos que contengan químicos potencialmente dañinos. Al elegir productos para el hogar, es crucial leer cuidadosamente las etiquetas para verificar la ausencia de estos y otros aditivos nocivos. En su lugar, los consumidores pueden considerar el uso de soluciones más seguras y ecológicas, como aceites esenciales naturales o mezclas de vinagre y bicarbonato de sodio, que ofrecen opciones menos invasivas para mantener un ambiente fresco sin los riesgos asociados con los productos tradicionales de fragancia.",

    "title": "Trump ally Steve Bannon must surrender to prison by July 1 to start contempt sentence, judge says",
    "text": "Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump , must report to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the U.S. Capitol insurrection , a federal judge ruled Thursday.\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington granted the Justice Department’s request to make Bannon begin his prison term after a federal appeals court panel last month upheld his contempt of Congress conviction.\nBannon is expected to seek a stay of the judge’s order, which could delay his surrender date.\n“I’ve got great lawyers, and we’re going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,” Bannon told reporters outside the courthouse. He added: “There’s not a prison built or jail built that will ever shut me up.”\nIn a social media post Thursday, Trump accused prosecutors of being “desperate” to jail Bannon. Trump repeated his claim that Republicans are being persecuted by a politically motivated justice system — rhetoric that has escalated in the wake of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s conviction last week on 34 felony charges in his New York hush money trial.\nNichols, the judge who ordered Bannon to report to prison, was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2018.\nBannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\nNichols had initially allowed him to remain free while he fought his conviction because the judge believed the case raised substantial legal questions. But during a hearing in Washington’s federal court, Nichols said the calculus changed after the appeals court panel said all of Bannon’s challenges lack merit.\n“I do not believe the original basis for my stay exists any longer,” Nichols said.\nBannon can appeal his conviction to the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Prosecutor John Crabb told the judge it was “very unlikely” Bannon would succeed in getting his conviction thrown out.\nBannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the former adviser didn’t ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would complete his entire sentence before he exhausted his appeals. Schoen said the case raises “serious constitutional issues” that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\nCapitol Riot Jun 5 Jan. 6 rioter caught in a woman's Bumble dating app sting sentenced to prison news Jun 5 Trump Georgia election case halted pending outcome of challenge to D.A. “In this country, we don’t send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,” he told reporters.\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence .\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn’t cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn’t prove Trump had actually invoked it.\nThe House Jan. 6 committee’s final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.\nBannon is also facing criminal charges in New York state court alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S. southern border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges, and that trial has been postponed until at least the end of September.",

(Photo d'archives)\nPhoto : Radio-Canada / Jean-François Deschênes\nAprès avoir forcé le F.- A. Gauthier à rester à quai durant les vacances de la construction, cet été, les deux syndicats des employés de la traverse Matane–Baie-Comeau–Godbout menacent de retourner en grève les 12 et 13 décembre.\nLe Regroupement des traversiers, syndicat affilié à la CSN, a signifié ses intentions au ministère du Travail vendredi. Il pige ainsi dans sa banque illimitée de jours de grève votée au mois de mai dernier.\nLe syndicat estime que [les négociations piétinent depuis trop longtemps](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2091822/negociation-traversier-matane-cote-nord-greve) et qu’elles achoppent en raison de la position stagnante de la partie patronale, la Société des Traversiers du Québec (STQ) et le Conseil du trésor, et ce, malgré [les moyens de pression mis en place cet été](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2090046/greve-traverse-matane-cote-nord-syndicat-stq-csn) ainsi que la [nomination d’un conciliateur au dossier](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2090386/greve-conciliateur-stq-traversier-matane-baie-comeau-godbout).\nLes syndiqués de la STQ étaient en grève cet été durant deux séquences qui coïncidaient avec les vacances de la construction. (Photo d'archives)\nPhoto : Radio-Canada / Claude Côté\nLe porte-parole du syndicat, Patrick St-Laurent, rappelle également que la convention collective est échue depuis le printemps 2023.\nEn mars 2024, ce n’était toujours pas réglé. On se dirige dangereusement vers mars 2025 […] on va être rendu bientôt à trois augmentations salariales qu’on n’a pas eues\n, relève M. St-Laurent.\nC’est une stratégie d’étranglement par le temps et on trouve ça un peu indécent!\nPatrick St-Laurent soutient que, depuis l’arrivée du conciliateur, les discussions à la table des négociations sont bonnes et cordiales. Il constate par contre un réel blocage au niveau du mandat monétaire imposé par le Conseil du trésor\n. C'est, selon lui, ce qui motive la prochaine grève.\nLes principaux points à la table de négociations sont les salaires et les conditions de travail des employés. Le syndicat déplore que les propositions d’augmentations de la partie patronale soient conditionnelles à un consentement de plusieurs reculs du côté du syndicat.\nPrésentement, l’offre de l’employeur c’est 12,7 % [d’augmentation sur cinq ans] et si nous acceptons plusieurs reculs inacceptables pour nous, l’offre pourrait monter à 17,4 %, ce qui ne permettra même pas de rehausser les taux horaires à un niveau acceptable face à la concurrence\n, précise M. St-Laurent.\nLe porte-parole du Regroupement des traversier CNS, Patrick St-Laurent, déplore aussi une «participation anémique» à l’assurance collective de la part de l'employeur. (Photo d'archives)\nPhoto : Radio-Canada / Kevin Duquette-Goulet\nLa STQ indique qu’elle ne fera pas de commentaires à ce sujet.\nPar écrit, un représentant de la Société précise que le droit de grève de ses travailleurs sera respecté, mais trouve dommage que les employés aient eu recours à ce moyen de pression à ce moment-ci, puisque les négociations se poursuivent, tel que le calendrier des négociations le prévoit\n.\nLe Regroupement des traversiers CSN regroupe les deux syndicats de la traverse matanaise et nord-côtière — soit le Syndicat des employés de la Traverse de Matane–Baie-Comeau–Godbout et le Syndicat des employées et employés de la STQ de Matane–Baie-Comeau–Godbout — ainsi que le Syndicat des employés de la Société des Traversiers Québec–Lévis.\nTous sont affiliés à la Fédération des employées et employés de services publics (FEESP–CSN).",
