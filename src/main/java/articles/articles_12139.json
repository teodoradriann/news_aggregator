    "text": "Ravens Want Playoff Revenge Against Bills\nIt's been four years since the Baltimore Ravens last traveled to western New York to face the Buffalo Bills in a playoff game.\nThe result didn't end how the Ravens had hoped; a 17-3 loss in the Divisional Round sent the Ravens right back home, allowing the Bills to march on to the AFC Championship Game.\nWith the same stakes on the line this weekend, Ravens tight end Mark Andrews is hoping for a different outcome.\n\"Yes, of course [I remember],\" Andrews said about the last Bills playoff game. \"Lamar [Jackson] talked about it. It's just [about] being able to learn from your mistakes and growing throughout the years, and I think this team is different than all the teams in the past. We're going to be ready to go.\"\nWith the Ravens trailing by a touchdown, Jackson was marching the offense down the field. He had the Ravens inside the Bills' 10-yard line and threw a pass in the end zone intended for Andrews, but it ended up in the hands of Buffalo defensive back Taron Johnson, who returned the interception for 101 yards for a touchdown that doubled their seven-point lead.\nThe play was the final score in the game as the Ravens were unable to recover, but Jackson is making it his mission to ensure that doesn't happen again.\n\"Hell yes. I just saw it. I just saw a little clip they always like to post they like to throw that out there that little interception return. Yes, that's all I'm going to say about that though,\" Jackson said.\nJackson is prepared to let his play do the talking on Sunday, as he hopes to bring the Ravens back to the AFC Championship Game for the second year in a row.\nMake sure you bookmark Baltimore Ravens On SI for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!",

    "text": "[Jueves, 21 de Marzo de 2024] Casas inundadas y techos desprendidos en la localidad de Usme, sur de Bogotá, fue el saldo que dejaron las fuertes lluvias y vendavales que se presentaron en este jueves 21 de marzo. Videos que circulan en redes sociales muestran los angustiantes momentos cuando casas se destruyen desde su parte superior. Por otro lado, algunas víctimas del fenómeno natural aseguran que esta noche estarán a la intemperie, pues habitaciones quedaron bajo el agua y, además, en otras zonas no hay energía eléctrica. [Haga clic aquí para seguirnos en WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va67qiqCMY0IauxJAF0m) \"El agua abrió la puerta y se entró a la casa, como ven. Aquí toca entrar agachado porque la casa quedó llena de escombro, hasta la cocina\", sostiene un ciudadano en un contenido multimedia. En otro contenido se puede ver cómo el agua avanza con bastante fuerza e ingresa a varias casas, dañando sofás, comedores y diferentes objetos residenciales. Por otro lado, el Instituto Distrital de Gestión de Riesgos y Cambio Climático (Idiger), afirmó que funcionarios ya se encuentran en el lugar y hasta el momento no han dado cifras exactas de las familias damnificadas. \"Nuestro equipo junto con las demás entidades estamos al tanto de la situación y brindaremos el apoyo necesario a los ciudadanos afectados por esta emergencia\", se lee en el comunicado de la entidad. Otros ciudadanos también reportaron daños estructurales en diferentes puntos de la capital.",

    "title": "Ottawa teen raced in socks to get help for friends who fell through ice: 911 caller",
    "text": "OTTAWA — It was about 9:30 p.m. when a young man came racing to her yard in his socks, a T-shirt and shorts. No coat. No phone. Dripping wet.\n\"He was yelling he needed help because his friend had fallen through the ice,\" says Carly Roome.\nShe called the police right away, and she and her parents spoke with the boy, who was \"really shaken up,\" to get more details as she spoke to the 911 operator.\nThe boy had pulled his sister out of the Rideau River, about 400 metres away from where Roome lives. But he was worried about those he was unable to save.\nThe family drove the teenager back to the site, where his sister was waiting, and Roome passed her phone over to the teenager so he could provide more details about what happened.\n\"The sister was just, like, yelling, and just, like, really freaked out,\" Roome said.\n\"So I just held her while he was on the phone.\"\nPolice confirmed Thursday morning that one teenager was dead. Another was still missing.\nPolice said Thursday that emergency crews responded to a call about four teens falling into the river from Nicolls Island Road at 9:45 p.m. Police reported earlier that the first call came in at roughly 11:45 p.m., but later clarified that was a mistake.\nThey said two of the teenagers were immediately rescued from the water and were taken to hospital by paramedics, while a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old boy were still missing and believed to be in the water.\nPolice said a rescue operation took place in \"very difficult conditions,\" and included a surface and water search. Divers recovered the body of one of the missing teenagers.\nThe search for the second missing teen was paused overnight and did not resume in the morning. Just before 3 p.m. on Thursday, an underwater search and recovery unit arrived on the scene and set up a tent near the edge of the river.\nAsked why the police press release implied that two teens were rescued when Roome's account suggests that one rescued himself and his sister, a police spokesperson noted that the release did not specify how the youths were rescued.\n\"I really feel for the boy that came to our house. He saved his sister and tried to save his friend,\" said Roome.\n\"And then in like no clothes ran to our house to get more help for his friend. I just really think he did everything that he could.\"\nThree marked police vehicles had been parked near the Long Island Locks of the Rideau Canal on a rainy Thursday morning, as milder-than-average temperatures persisted in Ottawa.\nYellow police tape was wrapped around the locks near the river, where a thin layer of ice appeared to extend outward from the shore, met by open water.\nPolice also taped off an area near the shoreline.\nNearby, a black SUV was parked and blocked off with tape. The licence plates on the front and back of the vehicle were covered.\nAsked for more details, the police spokesperson said more information was not being shared because it remains an ongoing police operation.\n\"We have offered supports to the loved ones of the youths,\" an earlier police statement read. \"This tragedy affects us all.\"\nThe search for the missing teen comes amid a spate of similar incidents across the country.\nRCMP in Alberta confirmed this week that a family of three died after falling through thin ice while riding their UTV in the lead-up to Christmas.\nThe Mounties also said a man died after falling through ice near Calgary on Christmas Day.\nLast month, the RCMP in Saskatchewan reported that two girls fell through ice on a lake. One of them died, along with two men who were attempting a rescue.\nAnd in Quebec this week, provincial police said the search for a four-year-old girl who fell into a river last week is now being considered a recovery operation rather than a rescue mission.\nAfter the Prairies deaths, Mounties were reminding outdoor enthusiasts that ice should be at least 15 centimetres thick for a person to walk or skate on it.\nThe thickness should be at least 20 centimetres for a group of people and 25 centimetres for the use of a snowmobile or off-road vehicle.\nAsked on Thursday whether Ottawa police had any message to the public about safety around ice, the spokesperson said the service's website points to advice from the Canadian Red Cross.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\n— With files from Maan Alhmidi in Toronto.\nStephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press",
