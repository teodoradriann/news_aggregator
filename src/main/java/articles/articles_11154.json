    "text": "Saúde\nCasos respiratórios graves seguem em alta após volta às aulas\nOs casos de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave - SRAG - entre crianças e adolescentes de até 14 anos permanecem em alta após a volta às aulas no Distrito Federal e em cinco estados: Goiás, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo e Sergipe.\nÉ o que aponta a última edição do Boletim Infogripe, divulgado nesta quinta-feira (20), no Rio de Janeiro, pela Fiocruz. O termo SRAG designa os casos de síndrome gripal que evoluem com comprometimento da função respiratória, geralmente exigindo hospitalização.\n\"As crianças passam mais tempo em ambientes fechados e em maior contato, favorecendo a transmissão dos vírus respiratórios\", explica a pesquisadora Tatiana Portella. O boletim acende também um alerta para as infecções por vírus sincicial respiratório - VSR - no Distrito Federal e em Goiás, o que tem provocado aumento de casos de SRAG entre bebês de até 2 anos.\nGeralmente, o VSR circula mais durante o inverno, mas somente este ano foram registrados mais de 460 casos de SRAG motivados pelo vírus em todo o país, com 16 mortes.\nCovid-19\nNo entanto, a covid-19 continua sendo a infecção viral mais letal: as mortes por SRAG este ano passam de 1 mil e mais de 81% dos óbitos com diagnóstico confirmado de algum vírus foram causados por covid-19. A maioria das vítimas eram idosos.\nEm quatro estados, a pesquisa observou aumento de casos com sinais característicos de covid-19: Mato Grosso, Roraima, Sergipe e Tocantins. Neste último, chama a atenção a quantidade de ocorrências entre jovens e adultos.\nAlém disso, sete unidades federativas apresentam níveis de alerta ou risco nas tendências de curto e longo prazo, independentemente da causa: Amazonas, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Rondônia, Roraima, Sergipe e Tocantins.\nEsportes\nTribunal espanhol condena Luis Rubiales por beijo sem consentimento",

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "title": "La Justicia argentina dicta prisión preventiva para el hombre que lanzó una botella a Milei en el desfile de asunción",
    "text": "MADRID, 28 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) - Un juez federal de Argentina ha dictado prisión preventiva y 500.000 pesos (560 euros) de fianza para Gastón Mercanzini, el hombre al que acusa del delito de tentativa de lesiones dolosas por lanzar una botella contra Javier Milei durante el desfile del día de su asunción como presidente de la nación, el pasado 10 de diciembre. \"Es preciso señalar que el imputado actuó con dolo directo contra el jefe de Estado\", ha manifestado el juez Ariel Lijo, que sin embargo considera que Mercanzini actuó \"con dolo eventual\" contra Karina Milei, hermana del mandatario y quien también se encontraba a bordo del vehículo oficial aquel día. Asimismo, el juez Lijo ha recalcado que tanto las imágenes captadas durante el 10 de diciembre; como las afirmaciones de Mercanzini aquel día, reconociendo estar \"alterado\" por el discurso de Milei; y sus publicaciones en redes sociales, conducen a presumir que el acusado actuó para \"lesionar\" al presidente. Respecto a Karina Milei, el magistrado Lijo considera que el acusado actuó \"con dolo eventual\" debido a que, aunque Mercanzini \"no podía desconocer\" que ella también viajaba a bordo del vehículo, siguió adelante con su plan de atacar al presidente \"y actuó sin importarle el resultado\" de unas posibles lesiones a Karina. El juez Lijo ha procesado también a Mercanzini por el delito de lesiones leves dolosas calificadas por haber sido cometidas contra un miembro de las fuerzas de seguridad policiales, en relación al policía federal, encargado de la seguridad de Milei, que resultó lesionado aquel día, recoge la agencia Télam. Las fuerzas de seguridad de Buenos Aires detuvieron a mediados de diciembre a Mercanzini, acusado de lanzar una botella contra Milei y su hermana durante un desfile el día de la toma de posesión. La botella finalmente impactó contra uno de los agentes que participaba como escolta en la comitiva.",

    "text": "Il Benfica ha ufficializzato il suo nuovo allenatore. Sarà Bruno Lage a guidare le Aquile. Il tecnico ha firmato un contratto fino al 2026 e oggi è stato presentato alla stampa : “Con quale spirito ritorno? Con quello di chi torna e vuole vincere. Raccontatemi un allenatore che non ha vinto e non ha perso. Se guardiamo la media degli anni e dei titoli, quello di Bruno Lage forse è molto simile agli altri. Mio figlio vorrà visitarlo un giorno, ma non ho mai voluto interferire e non l’ho mai portato al Museo del Benfica .\nCome vedi la squadra? “Se ricordo bene, la mia idea era sempre una rosa corta, competitiva ed equilibrata, con due per ruolo, che mi desse la possibilità di giocare in modi diversi, guardando la rosa e potendo cambiare sistema e dinamiche ed essere competitivi dentro e fuori. E la vedo così. La cosa più importante è che, indipendentemente dalle partenze, possiamo guardare la rosa e sentire che è stata creata, adattata e competitiva per quello che ci aspetta. Non li conosco, ma quando vedi un atleta uscire di casa è sempre motivo di soddisfazione, per il lavoro che è stato fatto alla base e per il modo in cui i giocatori raggiungono la prima squadra”.\nFoto: twitter Benfica",

    "text": "El presidente chileno, Gabriel Boric, celebró este jueves el 53 aniversario de la nacionalización del cobre y dijo que el mineral rojo es “el sueldo de Chile” y “la vía hacia un país más justo, libre y soberano”.\nEn una ceremonia en Chuquicamata, considerada la mina de cobre a rajo abierto más grande del mundo, Boric aseguró que la producción de cobre -del que Chile es el mayor productor del mundo- le ha reportado al Estado más de US$ 160,000 millones desde 1971.\n“Ha sido el sueldo de Chile, pilar sobre el cual se han construido muchos de los beneficios sociales y políticas de bienestar con la que hoy cuentan los chilenos y chilenas”, indicó el mandatario en Chuquicamata, ubicada en Calama, a más de 1,200 kilómetros al norte de Santiago.\nDesde inicios del siglo XX, los principales yacimientos de cobre de Chile eran explotados por capitales extranjeros, como Kennecott Copper Company en El Teniente y Anaconda Copper en Chuquicamata.\nA mediados de siglo, empezaron a surgir críticas al poco aporte que estas compañías hacían a la economía nacional.\nEl 11 de julio de 1971, durante el gobierno del socialista Salvador Allende, el Congreso aprobó por unanimidad la ley N°17.450, que traspasó al Estado la propiedad de la gran minería del cobre y creó la estatal Codelco, la mayor cuprífera del mundo.\n“Nuestro cobre sigue siendo una viga maestra y una vía hacia el futuro, hacia un Chile más justo, libre y soberano”, indicó el gobernante.\nCodelco es una de las decenas de compañías que explotan el mineral rojo en Chile, donde la minería supone casi un 12 % del PIB y se producen cerca de 5.5 millones de toneladas cada año.\n“¡Codelco no se privatiza! Es más, Codelco no sólo no se privatiza, sino que avanza en nuevas funciones y exploraciones, como lo estamos haciendo con el litio, que también tiene que ser profundamente chileno”, agregó Boric, en referencia a la nueva estrategia que ha impulsado para convertir a la estatal en un actor relevante en la industria del litio.\nChile es el segundo productor mundial de litio, detrás de Australia, pero su producción en la actualidad se concentra solo en el Salar de Atacama y está concesionada a la chilena SQM y la estadounidense Abermale.\nLa propuesta del Ejecutivo cambia este escenario y entrega a Codelco el control mayoritario de Atacama -que explotará con SQM- y Maricunga, otro salar estratégico.\nComienza a destacar en el mundo empresarial recibiendo las noticias más exclusivas del día en tu bandeja\n[Aquí].
