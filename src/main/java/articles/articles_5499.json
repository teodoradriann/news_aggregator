    "text": "UF team plays major role in success of newly approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Duchenne muscular dystrophy families, advocates and health care providers celebrated a milestone in March with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the first nonsteroidal drug for the treatment of Duchenne. In [findings](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(24)00036-X/fulltext) published in the April issue of The Lancet Neurology, a team of investigators led by pharmaceutical company Italfarmaco, in collaboration with the University of Florida, demonstrated that the drug is associated with slower functional decline and decreased fat replacement in muscle. “This announcement brings a lot of hope and opportunity to patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their families. It is a very big step forward for the community and provides an effective treatment for families and providers,” said Krista Vandenborne, Ph.D., P.T., a distinguished professor and chair of the [department of physical therapy](https://pt.phhp.ufl.edu/) at the [UF College of Public Health and Health Professions](https://phhp.ufl.edu/) and a member of the phase 3 clinical trial team that evaluated the new drug, marketed as Duvyzat. Duchenne is a severe form of muscular dystrophy that affects about 1 in 3,500 boys born each year in the United States. It causes muscles to progressively weaken and lose the ability to regenerate after an injury, eventually replacing muscle tissue with fat and collagen. Many children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may require a wheelchair by adolescence, and heart and respiratory systems are affected as the disease advances. Duvyzat works by inhibiting an enzyme that leads to muscle damage. The randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study demonstrated that Duvyzat was associated with 40% less decline in participants’ walking and stair-climbing function. In MRI measurements of thigh muscles conducted by the UF team, the drug showed a 30% reduction in muscle being replaced by fat. It has been approved for children with Duchenne age 6 and older, regardless of which genetic mutation of the disease they may have. A new and highly effective drug to treat Duchenne represents a significant advance in treatment options for the disease, experts and families say. Current standard of care for Duchenne is the use of steroids, which can delay loss of walking function by two to three years but come with a host of side effects, including increased risk of bone fractures and weight gain. The Duvyzat drug trial is the first phase 3 clinical trial in Duchenne to use MR imaging. UF’s expertise in MR imaging techniques played a major role in the clinical trial’s design, including the development of participant inclusion criteria based on the UF team’s long-term studies of the national progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and in key measures of the drug’s effectiveness. UF researchers led by Vandenborne, the director of neuromuscular dystrophy research program [ImagingNMD](https://imagingnmd.org/), have pioneered the use of MR biomarkers to capture highly accurate and noninvasive measures of muscle changes in children with Duchenne. Using MR measures in studies like these overcomes the limitations of traditional methods of determining study outcomes, such as measuring a child’s walking speed or other timed functional tests, Vandenborne said. “Functional endpoints, particularly in the pediatric population, are influenced by motivation,” she said. “If you have a 5-year-old boy and you say, ‘I want to see how far you can walk or how fast you can walk,’ they may be having a good day or a bad day and the results are not always objective.” The UF team is currently contributing MR measurements to a number of clinical trials, including gene therapy studies and additional studies of Duvyzat in patients who have lost the ability to walk. The team also leads [a study](https://imagingnmd.org/becker-muscular-dystrophy-study/?/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=BMD_1&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqpSwBhClARIsADlZ_Tl_lnn67Rb5Girt5AJoUCqcBN01llWJLi2FIdVm9RxEc0Jd6ExemWUaAmDYEALw_wcB) of the natural progression of Becker muscular dystrophy. “The Duvyzat trial was a really well-designed study optimized with MR measures,” Vandenborne said. “The strategies used here can be applied to many neuromuscular diseases.” The Duvyzat phase 3 clinical trial was funded by Italfarmaco.

    "text": "Personas con paraguas por las calles de Málaga, a 29 de octubre de 2024, en Málaga, Andalucía (España). - Álex Zea - Europa Press MADRID 1 Nov. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa lluvia y las tormentas pondrán este viernes en aviso a siete provincias en un día en el que cuatro de ellas alcanzarán el nivel naranja por precipitaciones, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET). En concreto, los avisos naranja por lluvia estarán en Huelva (Andalucía) y Tarragona (Cataluña). Además, Mallorca y Menorca estarán en aviso naranja por lluvias y tormentas.\nPor lo demás, los avisos amarillos por tormenta estarán en Huelva (Andalucía); Tarragona (Cataluña). Además, habrá avisos amarillos por lluvia en Alicante y Valencia (Comunidad Valenciana). Por otro lado, se registrarán avisos amarillos por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza y Formentera (Baleares) y Badajoz (Extremadura).\nEn líneas generales, AEMET prevé que la Península y Baleares continúen bajo la influencia de bajas presiones, con precipitaciones que afectarán al cuadrante sudoeste, sudoeste de Castilla y León, Aragón, Cataluña, Levante y Baleares. Por el contrario, no se esperan precipitaciones o son muy poco probables en el norte de Galicia, Cantábrico, norte de la meseta Norte y alto Ebro. En el resto de las zonas no se pueden descartar.\nLa predicción apunta a que pueden darse chubascos y tormentas localmente fuertes y/o persistentes en el extremo occidental de Andalucía, y podrían registrarse también en el bajo Ebro y Baleares, y zonas del sur del sistema Central occidental. Mientras, en Canarias, el día será poco nuboso o con intervalos.\nEn lo que respecta a las temperaturas, las máximas estarán en aumento en el oeste peninsular y en descenso en el resto, mientras que las mínimas subirán en el sudoeste y en el área cantábrica. En el resto no se registrarán grandes cambios.\nPor último, AEMET indica que predominarán vientos de componente este en la Península y Baleares, flojos en general en interiores y algo más intensos en litorales, y con posibles intervalos de fuerte en zonas de Cádiz y Baleares. En el archipiélago canariol, soplarán vientos flojos.\nLeer más acerca de: Mallorca Menorca AEMET Huelva",

    "title": "Providers, SEIU announce 'historic' partnership on nursing home workforce challenges - McKnight's Long-Term Care News",
    "text": "What’s being called a historic partnership between two long-term care advocacy groups is requesting millions in investment dollars to assist Pennsylvania operators in recruiting and retaining workers.\nThe Pennsylvania Health Care Association and SEIU Healthcare PA announced a new collaboration at a Wednesday press conference to “solve the dire healthcare workforce challenges impacting residents across the state.”\nPHCA President and CEO Zach Shamberg said his organization has proudly partnered with various stakeholders and associations in the past, but this venture with SEIU is much different.\n“This is the first time providers and workers are teaming up on behalf of the sector to advocate for meaningful change,” Shamberg told McKnight’s Long-Term Care News on Wednesday. “When we say the long-term care continuum is in the midst of crisis, we truly mean the entire continuum — and that includes both providers and workers. Our partnership is built on the foundation of collective advocacy.”\nHe expects their work to have a trickledown effect: What benefits providers will ultimately support workers. So Pennsylvania institutions can no longer afford to work individually or in silos, he stressed.\nPart of the collaboration will involve a full-court press for a much-needed update to the budget adjustment factor, according to a Wednesday press release.\nThey’re seeking a BAF reimbursement of 0.9%, as proposed through House Bill 1310. The legislation would make an additional $140 million available to long-term care providers and “provide sustainability and predictability for providers, workers, and residents throughout the commonwealth.”\nThe BAF has long been a thorn for operators who rely on efficient financial planning.\nPennsylvania is one of five states with a budget adjustment factor — or BAF — which prompts an executive agency to cut back intended spending.\nThe state’s Department of Human Services weighs a provider’s expected per diem rate against previous state averages, which often brings rates down by 10% or so, and sometimes as much as 40%, depending on an individual providers’ geography and patient make-up.\nThe budget adjustment factor resets each quarter, leaving providers with little ability to anticipate actual payments or acquire capital for needed reinvestments in their facilities. This month, the BAF was set at 0.83, resulting in a new average loss of $50 per patient day for providers — despite having received a planned rate increase at the start of the year January.\nGoal alignment\nThe provider-union collaborative effort also will focus on strengthening the Medicaid program for residents and direct caregivers, Shamberg said. And it will push staff development initiatives, training opportunities and growing the workforce.\nThough Pennsylvania has the fifth-oldest population, other nearby states’ Medicaid reimbursement rates trump the commonwealth’s $256 per resident per day rate. By comparison, Maryland’s current reimbursement rate is $375 per day, New York’s is $299 per day and New Jersey’s is $275, according to the press release.\nFor providers in other states who may be looking to forge similar partnerships to tackle long-term care challenges, ensuring goal alignment is the first step, Shamberg asserted.\n“When we began this journey in 2022, we first brought our providers and SEIU leadership to the table to focus on two specific questions: Where do we agree, and which state issues can we tackle together?” he explained. “If associations across the country are looking to forge a similar relationship or partnership, it’s important to focus on the shared goals of both providers and workers.”",

    "title": "Biden autoriza sanciones a quienes promuevan actos violentos en Cisjordania",
    "text": "El presidente de\nEstados Unidos, Joe Biden, ha firmado este jueves una orden ejecutiva con la cual autoriza la imposición de sanciones a aquellas personas que promuevan actos violentos en Cisjordania, donde \"los altos niveles de violencia de los colonos extremistas\" han alcanzado \"niveles intolerables\".\nDe acuerdo con el mandatario estadounidense, los niveles de violencia, sumados al desplazamiento forzado de personas y la destrucción de propiedades, representan también \"una grave amenaza a la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad de Cisjordania y\nGaza, Israel y la región de Oriente Próximo\".\n\"Estas acciones socavan los objetivos de política exterior de Estados Unidos, incluida la viabilidad de una solución de dos Estados y garantizar que israelíes y palestinos puedan alcanzar medidas iguales de seguridad, prosperidad y libertad\", apunta Biden en una nota difundida por la\n Casa Blanca.\nEn este contexto, Biden ha ordenado sanciones contra las propiedades de aquellas personas señaladas por la Administración como responsables o cómplices de acciones violentas en Cisjordania o que atenten contra la seguridad de la población local; o que hayan trabajado para empresas que desarrollen estas acciones.\nPor su parte, el asesor de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca, Jake Sullivan, ha señalado que el presidente Biden ha reiterado en numerosas ocasiones el derecho de\nIsrael a defenderse de los ataques del Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica ( Hamás) de comienzos de octubre, que dejaron casi 1.200 muertos. Además, ha incidido en que la Administración estadounidense se muestra preocupada por \"el aumento de la violencia\" registrada en Cisjordania \"por parte de actores extremistas, en particular el aumento de la violencia de los colonos extremistas\", que ha alcanzado cotas \"récord\" en 2023.\n\"Esta violencia representa una grave amenaza para la paz, la seguridad y la estabilidad en Cisjordania, Israel y la región de Oriente Próximo, y amenaza la seguridad nacional y los intereses de política exterior de Estados Unidos\", ha señalado Sullivan, suscribiendo las palabras de Biden.\nAsí las cosas, el asesor de Seguridad Nacional ha destacado que la orden ejecutiva de Biden permitirá emitir sanciones financieras contra quienes dirijan o participen en actos de violencia, intimidación o desplazamiento forzado de civiles, o participen en actos terroristas en Cisjordania. \"El Departamento de Estado también anunciará hoy un conjunto inicial de designaciones bajo esta nueva orden ejecutiva\", ha adelantado un Sullivan que destaca que esta medida adoptada por Biden \"busca promover la paz y la seguridad tanto para israelíes como para palestinos\".\nPrimeras sanciones a cuatro colonos israelíes\nEste mismo jueves, Estados Unidos ha impuesto las primeras sanciones contra cuatro colonos israelíes de la Cisjordania ocupada. Los sancionados son David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil, Shalom Zicherman y Yinon Levi a los que ya se les había prohibido la entrada a Estados Unidos. Asimismo, se les bloquearán todos los activos que puedan tener en Estados Unidos y se les impedirá recibir transacciones de estadounidenses, es decir, se les privará el acceso al sistema financiero estadounidense.\nChasdai lideró unos disturbios en Huwara con quema de vehículos y de edificios y ataques a civiles palestinos que derivaron en la muerte de un palestino de Cisjordania, mientras que Tanjil estuvo implicado en ataques a granjeros palestinos.\nPor otro lado, Levi lideró a un grupo de colonos que \"crearon una atmósfera de miedo en Cisjordania\" con ataques a múltiples comunidades. El sancionado atacó de forma \"frecuente\" a civiles palestinos y beduinos, amenazándoles para que abandonasen sus viviendas, quemando sus tierras y destruyendo sus propiedades. Zicherman, por su parte, atacó e hirió a activistas israelíes en Cisjordania.\nLa respuesta de Israel\nAnte este castigo, el Gobierno israelí defendió este jueves que la mayoría de los colonos israelíes, que viven en Cisjordania ocupada, son \"ciudadanos respetuosos con la ley\" y afirmó que Israel actúa contra todos los infractores de la ley, \"por lo que no hay lugar para medidas excepcionales a este respecto\".\n\"La mayoría absoluta de los colonos en Judea y Samaria (Cisjordania) son ciudadanos respetuosos de la ley, muchos de los cuales actualmente luchan regularmente y en las reservas para la defensa de Israel\", afirma un comunicado de la Oficina del Primer Ministro.",

    "text": "Vichyssoise tradicional: sopa de puerros y papas Aprende paso a paso y fácilmente a preparar una deliciosa vichyssoise con nuestra receta favorita e imbatible ¡a cocinar! La vichyssoise es una [sopa ](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/sopa-14213.html)fría y cremosa que combina ingredientes simples para crear un plato refinado y refrescante, perfecto para los días cálidos. Aunque sus orígenes son franceses, esta sopa también es muy popular en la cocina internacional, especialmente en Estados Unidos, donde fue popularizada por el chef francés Louis Diat en el famoso Hotel Ritz-Carlton de Nueva York en 1917. La base de esta [receta ](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/receta-92.html)es una mezcla de [puerros](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/puerros-27879.html), [papas ](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/papas-11813.html)y nata, lo que da como resultado una textura suave y un sabor delicado y levemente dulce. El carácter distintivo de la vichyssoise radica en los puerros, cuyo sabor sutil se mezcla a la perfección con la cremosidad de la nata y el ligero cuerpo de las papas. Su preparación es sencilla y, aunque se sirve fría, también se puede disfrutar caliente en climas fríos, adaptándose a cualquier temporada. Ideal como primer plato en una comida elegante o como un almuerzo ligero, la vichyssoise es versátil y fácil de preparar. Su presentación puede realzarse con cebollino fresco picado, lo cual aporta un toque de color y frescura que complementa maravillosamente sus sabores. ¡Vamos a la receta! Ingredientes 4 puerros medianos (solo la parte blanca y un poco de la parte verde), 1 cebolla pequeña (opcional), 2 papas grandes (aproximadamente 500 gramos), 750 ml de caldo de pollo o de verduras, 250 ml de crema de leche (nata), 2 cucharadas de mantequilla, sal y pimienta al gusto, cebollino fresco picado para decorar. Procedimiento - Lava bien los puerros y corta la parte blanca en rodajas finas. Si vas a usar cebolla, pícala también en trozos pequeños. Las papas, pélalas y córtalas en cubos medianos. Asegúrate de que las papas no queden demasiado grandes para que se cocinen uniformemente. - En una olla grande, derrite la mantequilla a fuego medio. Agrega los puerros y la cebolla, y saltéalos durante unos 10 minutos, o hasta que estén suaves y translúcidos. Asegúrate de que no se doren, ya que la vichyssoise debe tener un color claro y uniforme. Este paso ayuda a suavizar el sabor de los puerros y cebolla y hace que la sopa tenga un sabor delicado. - Una vez que los puerros y la cebolla estén bien cocidos, agrega los cubos de papa y vierte el caldo. Lleva la mezcla a ebullición, luego reduce el fuego a bajo y deja que se cocine a fuego lento durante unos 20-25 minutos, o hasta que las papas estén muy tiernas. Puedes probar con un tenedor: si las papas se deshacen fácilmente, ya están listas. - Una vez que las papas estén tiernas, retira la olla del fuego y deja que se enfríe un poco. Luego, licúa la sopa en varias tandas en una licuadora o utiliza una batidora de inmersión directamente en la olla. La textura debe quedar suave y sin grumos. Si deseas, puedes colar la mezcla para obtener una consistencia aún más fina, aunque esto es opcional. - Vierte la sopa licuada de vuelta a la olla y añade la nata. Revuelve bien para integrar y calienta a fuego bajo solo para mezclar los sabores, pero sin que llegue a hervir. - Prueba la sopa y ajusta la sal y pimienta a tu gusto. Luego, deja que se enfríe a temperatura ambiente antes de cubrirla y refrigerarla durante al menos 2 horas o hasta que esté bien fría. La vichyssoise se disfruta mejor a baja temperatura. Sirve la sopa en cuencos o platos hondos. Para una presentación elegante, añade un poco de cebollino fresco picado encima. Esto le dará color y un toque de sabor fresco que complementa perfectamente la cremosidad de la sopa. Si prefieres una textura muy fina, puedes pasar la sopa por un colador de malla fina antes de añadir la nata. La vichyssoise es una sopa que, aunque simple, resulta muy elegante y satisfactoria. Cada cucharada es una experiencia suave y delicada, con un equilibrio perfecto de sabores sutiles que encantarán a todos los paladares. ¡Y a disfrutar!

    "title": "Vea la brutal goleada de Liverpool de Luis Díaz en la Europa League: video | noticias HOY | EL ESPECTADOR",
    "text": "Cuatro goles en un cuarto de hora, ampliados por los dos anotados al inicio de la segunda parte, reafirmaron la distancia sideral entre el Liverpool y su rival, el Sparta Praga (6-1), en la vuelta de una eliminatoria sentenciada ya en la ida, cuando el conjunto de Jurgen Klopp ganó por 1-5. Luis Díaz fue suplente en el partido que finalizó con un global de 11-2. Salah lideró la contundente cara de presentación de los reds. El egipcio marcó uno de los cuatro tantos del inicio, el tercero, y asistió en otros dos, el del joven Bobby Clark, en el minuto 8 y el del neerlandés Cody Gakpo, en el 14. La cuenta la había abierto el uruguayo Darwin Núñez, a los siete minutos, tras recibir un balón del húngaro Dominik Szoboszlai. Al borde del descanso, el conjunto centroeuropeo maquilló la situación por medio del bosnio Veljko Birmancevic a pase del ecuatoriano Angelo Preciado. No levantó el pie del acelerador ni el Liverpool ni Salah tras el descanso. El astro africano sumó una asistencia más, la tercera en el choque, para que Szoboszlai hiciera el quinto. Hizo el sexto Marca Cody Gakpo, el segundo en su cuenta personal, y el Liverpool bajó el ritmo. Con un cómputo total de 11-2 el representante inglés, favorito al título en esta edición de la Liga Europa, dio por bueno el asunto y el resto fue un trámite. Liverpool alcanza así los cuartos de final de la Liga Europa, mientras el Sparta se despide del torneo continental. 🚴🏻⚽🏀 ¿Lo último en deportes?: Todo lo que debe saber del deporte mundial está en El Espectador",
