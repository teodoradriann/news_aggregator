    "text": "| | Anglican Communion secretary general’s Easter message Posted 42 mins ago | | [Anglican Communion News Service] Secretary General of the Anglican Communion Bishop Anthony Poggo shared an Easter message on March 28. “They have taken my Lord away, and I don’t know where they have put him.” When we read John’s gospel account of the woman discovering the empty tomb in the resurrection garden, we sense her surprise and shock. Things are not as she expected them to be. The stone has been rolled away and the tomb is empty. She runs and calls two of Jesus’ disciples. They too start running. At the tomb, all they find are the strips of linen that were wrapped around the crucified Jesus. It is a scene of disorder and disruption. In our world currently, millions of people are living in situations of extreme disorder and disruption, caused by issues like war and conflict, poverty and climate crisis. Civil War in Sudan is causing a humanitarian crisis that’s seeing ongoing loss of human life, food insecurity, economic decline and the displacement of more than 8 million people. Similarly, due to the Israel-Gaza conflict, the UN have declared that famine in Gaza is imminent. Globally, the impact of climate crisis, including rising pollution and extreme weather events, is harming health, causing mass displacement of people and increasing hunger risks. Amid such situations of conflict, suffering and inequality, the idea of a faithful God may feel incomprehensible. Like Mary Magdalene in the garden, we may find ourselves crying out, wondering why God is missing and absent. But as the story unfolds, we see that Jesus is indeed present, even though it takes Mary a while to recognise him as the risen Christ and not the gardener. As Jesus stands before her, death’s defeat is disrupted by resurrection hope, reordering all that is broken in the world. It is a redemptive act, bringing transformation, peace and hope. Appearing to his disciples, the first words Jesus utters to them is “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” As Secretary General – and in our work as an Anglican Communion Office – we are in close contact with many Anglican churches around the globe who are actively working for peace and restoration in their settings. In recent weeks, I have had the privilege of visiting the Church of Sudan and as they seek to support people impacted by the civil war. I have visited the Church of Bangladesh and Church of Myanmar seeing firsthand many of the vital church and community projects they deliver. Our Anglican UN Team have represented the voice of Anglicans at the Commission on the Status of Women, speaking out on matters of gender justice, empowerment and poverty alleviation. The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem and the Anglican Alliance continue to support humanitarian work in response to conflict in the Holy Land. In each situation – and many others like it – I am encouraged by the joint witness of Anglicans as they make visible the love of God in their communities. This Easter, may we continue to be an Anglican Communion that goes out, shares God’s hope and lives out a faith that longs for God’s restoration. Let us work for peace in a disrupted world. - [HeartSong: Building Communities of Practice Retreat](https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/events/heartsong-building-communities-of-practice-retreat/) - [SUMMA Theological Debate Summer Camp](https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/events/summa-theological-debate-summer-camp/) - [A Quiet Day for the Eclipse](https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/events/a-quiet-day-for-the-eclipse/) - [Spirituality for Social Justice](https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/events/spirituality-for-social-justice/) - [Aquinas @ Orvieto with Rev.

    "title": "“It Is Intoxicating”: Corey LaJoie Calls Out Kyle Busch for ‘Dragging His Name in Media’ Despite His Attempts to Cool the Beef Down - EssentiallySports",
    "text": "The Brickyard 400 race had many wrecks during the race, but none more impactful than Kyle Busch’s. Corey LaJoie hit Busch from the back on the lap 121 restart, which called for the caution flag that helped Kyle Larson win the race. Since that incident, Kyle Busch [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/kyle-busch/] has left no stone unturned in expressing how upset he is with LaJoie for costing him points in the race. Things have gotten pretty intense as Kyle Busch is unhappy with the outcome and LaJoie has been put under fire. LaJoie has already admitted to being at fault and managed to get away without a penalty after a conversation with NASCAR. But that was not the end of it, as many fans and critics came to take Busch’s side in the feud. Corey LaJoie, on the other hand, has taken accountability and is fighting off all the hate heading his way on social media. But it was only when Kyle Busch made his way to the Pat McAfee Show to put LaJoie on blast that the Spire Motorsports [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/spire-motorsports/] driver had to give a response. KYLE BUSCH HAS NOT SPOKEN TO COREY LAJOIE AFTER THE RACE When Ryan Flores spoke on the Stacking Pennies Podcast with Corey LaJoie, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg2UEqBUhQ4] they spoke about the most pressing matter at hand, the huge crash. After revealing that there is no penalty at hand, LaJoie stated, “Certainly, there’s a lot of collateral damage from that incident. It was certainly a mistake on my part, but I felt like it was put to bed.” Despite it being quite a big incident, Corey LaJoie managed to walk out of this without any penalties. Corey LaJoie [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/corey-lajoie/] was upset that he became the reason for such a major incident and explained, “I tried calling Kyle Busch twice. I left him a message and texted him. He didn’t seem too keen on a chat. I called RC; he didn’t seem too keen on a chat either.” Flores asked the No. 7 Chevrolet Camaro if he managed to speak to Richard Childress to which he responded saying, “No, and then I talked to Randall Burnett for a little while on the phone.” When Kyle Busch went on the Pat McAfee show, he went all ham on LaJoie for ruining his race. But when LaJoie heard about this, he explained on the podcast, “I will say this: It’s a natural tendency when you have, like, what’s the saying? An axe to grind? Yeah, oh yeah. If you have an axe to grind and a microphone in front of your face, it is intoxicating to just start going.” NASCAR is an aggressive sport and the adrenaline levels are always high. That’s why LaJoie continued to explain, “And I’ve done it, and my natural tendency is to keep doing it. Uh, but I usually try to stop you. I know, and I’m going to stop now because I’m going to prefer to try to de-escalate the situation.” LaJoie continued, “He goes on there, talks about Ricky, and talks about me, which are the two latest things to add to the woeful and dreadful season that is the 8-car. For what we’re accustomed to seeing out of Kyle Busch, the top five greatest drivers of all time, I think that was probably the last match to really flick off into his haystack and light it up. And he just happened to take the mic and drag my name across the media.” [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200822000618/Corey-LaJoie.jpg] As Kyle Busch went all in while expressing his feelings of frustration, many fans joined in on targeting LaJoie. The incident causer has faced a lot of backlash online for wrecking Busch’s car and here is what he had to say about it. COREY LAJOIE MUST KEEP A LEVEL HEAD Corey LaJoie continued to explain everything that the fans were saying to him for wrecking the 2 time Cup series [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/nascar-cup-series/] champion. He mentioned that people started to reach out to him saying, “Hey man, we’re thinking about you. Don’t let it get you down. I’m like, I really don’t know what you guys are talking about. I don’t see any of it.” Ryan Flores pitches in to say, “You got roasted on social media last week, which is a big change because, usually, what are people going to tell me that I haven’t heard before? ‘You suck; you’ve never won. Corey LaJoke'” Despite getting such reactions from fans, LaJoie is keeping his head up and maintaining his calm as he explained on the podcast. Spire Motorsports driver Corey LaJoie [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-02-16T183213Z_1147076085_MT1USATODAY17698230_RTRMADP_3_NASCAR-DAYTONA-500-MEDIA-DAY.jpg]Feb 16, 2022; Daytona, FL, USA; Feb 16, 2022; Daytona, FL, USA; NASCAR Cup Series driver Corey LaJoie (7) talks to the press during Daytona 500 media day at Daytona International Speedway. Mandatory Credit:Mandatory Credit: Mike Dinovo-USA TODAY Sports The backlash where fans are getting personal on his achievements does not bother him as he explains and that’s what he expects from a driver who races in one of the most dangerous motorsport events on the planet. That being said, what do you think of Kyle Busch’s reaction to getting wrecked by Corey LaJoie, do you think his statements are justified? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.",

    "title": "What does 12/31/23 mean? The last day of 2023 is an angel number",
    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests.\nIf you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported.\nThe once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website.\nThe date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported.\nHere’s what we know about the date.\nWhat does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month.\n\"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\"\nThe numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number.\nProfessional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.”\nIf you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12.\nThe number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.\nFYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks\nWhat are some dates to keep in mind in 2024? If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches.\nA palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nNumerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.\nHere are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac :\n4/2/24 4/20/24 4/21/24 4/22/24 4/23/24 4/24/24 4/25/24 4/26/24 4/27/24 4/28/24 4/29/24 Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today\n30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",
