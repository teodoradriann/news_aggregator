    "text": "Having grown up in Tulsa, Mayor G.T. Bynum has fond memories of going to Swan Lake in the midtown neighborhood with the same name. Located in the southeast corner of the Swan Lake Historic District, for decades the lake at 1573 Swan Drive featured a large fountain and actual swans. But after years of repairing the structure, which was erected in the 1930s, the city in 2001 declared the fountain unrepairable due to faulty plumbing and shut it down. Not long afterward, backers of the lake launched a fundraising campaign to rebuild the fountain. That effort failed, and the fountain has remained dry ever since. Bynum said this week that the inoperable fountain is symbolic to him. “The fact that that fountain hasn’t worked for a quarter century was a symbol of the city’s inability to fix problems,” Bynum told the Tulsa World during a Wednesday meeting with the paper's Editorial Board. People are also reading… Now closing in on completing his eighth and final year as mayor, Bynum said fixing the Swan Lake fountain is one of his pet projects that he hopes to see completed before he leaves office. “We will have the Swan Lake fountain operating by the end of this year,” Bynum told the Editorial Board. Tulsa Parks Director Anna America said the fountain was left inoperable for the same reasons other city needs aren’t met: The city didn’t have the money and previous administrations didn’t set it as a high enough priority for inclusion in capital improvements packages. America said Bynum made the project a priority for his administration. Funding for $1.7 million of the project was approved by voters in the November 2019 Improve Our Tulsa capital improvements package. Voters approved another $500,000 in funding for the project in the August 2023 Improve Our Tulsa capital improvements package to bring the total budget to $2.2 million. Daris Construction submitted the winning base bid of $1,871,542.50, which includes the installation of a lake aeration system, records show. America said replacing the fencing around the lake is still being considered but may not be necessary. More landscaping may be included once the lake is drained if no unexpected costs are discovered, she said. Construction at the lake began in March and is expected to be complete by the end of October. The new fountain is scheduled to be turned on by Nov. 1, with cleanup work and other miscellaneous activity complete by Thanksgiving, America said. Bynum’s mayoral term expires Dec. 2.",

    "text": "中国青年报客户端讯（中青报·中青网记者 魏其濛）近日，上海市教卫工作党委、上海市教委印发《深化新时代中小学体育工作高质量发展的若干措施》（以下简称《若干措施》），聚焦当前中小学体育工作重点难点，从课程、赛事、场地、师资、保障等9个方面建立深化中小学体育工作高质量发展长效机制。\n近年来，上海出台过多个关于中小学体育工作的文件。例如，2023年9月出台的《上海市促进中小学校体育工作高质量发展进一步提升学生体质健康水平行动方案》明确要求，保障学生每天校内外运动时间不少于2小时；2025年2月出台的《上海市中小学体育工作管理办法》，提出要加强课外校外体育锻炼，全面实施学校体育家庭作业制度，鼓励根据学生体质健康实际情况，布置有针对性的家庭作业。\n近日发布的《若干措施》进一步要求，学校要全面落实学生每天综合体育活动2小时并基本在校内完成，包括每天70分钟左右的体育课、体育活动课、大课间，另外还有不少于40分钟的体育锻炼活动，每月至少安排半天的“乐动比赛日”等，吸引学生走出教室、走向操场、走入阳光。\n关于“每天综合体育活动2小时并基本在校内完成”具体如何落实，在市教委今天举办的新闻通气会上，几位区教育局负责人、校长进行了分享。\n黄浦区教育局副局长金羿说，面对中心城区土地资源紧张的挑战，黄浦从时长、空间、质量上破题，在保障体育运动时长上，做到排课时体育课优先，搭配课间大活动，确保学生每日在校体育活动基本达到2小时；同时，学校将碎片空间转化为运动场域，并向外拓展，例如，黄浦外国语小学就把课堂搬到了滨江步道。\n杨浦区教育局副局长曾除非表示，针对体育师资不足的问题，杨浦区将举办“非体育学科教师运动技能系列培训班”，挖潜具有体育兴趣爱好的年轻教师和导师，对外邀请区体育部门教练、上体大研究生等进校园实施课后社团服务。\n普陀区洵阳路小学校长朱乃楣介绍说，洵阳路小学面积十分有限，近年来，学校“上天入地”创造活动空间。一方面往上拓展运动空间，西校区打造了150平方米的专业级攀岩墙，有4根标准的攀岩赛道，可以满足标准赛事；另一方面，用防空洞打造了1300平方米的地下空间，陆续安装了空气净化系统和监测系统，提升室内空气质量，开辟了旱地冰壶教室、乒乓、垫上运动和击剑等活动空间，“一上一下”就扩大了1500平方米。\n《若干措施》图解。上海市教委供图 【责任编辑：梁国胜 原春琳 编辑：何欣】",

However, the CUPW 730 interim president said the union remains steadfast in a negotiated settlement.\n\"There may or may not be a member who feels that they're frustrated,\" James Ball told CTV News Edmonton. \"Maybe they do want binding arbitration, but I've been entrusted to speak for 55,000 members across the country and 2,700 members in this local and we want a negotiated contract.\n\"I can understand their frustration. I mean, we've been trying to negotiate a solution to this for over a year. The contract should have been settled six months ago.\"\nCUPW wants salaries brought in line with inflation, an increase in paid medical days, better benefits, and to prevent the company from using private contractors.\nWith files from Nicole Lampa and The Canadian Press",
