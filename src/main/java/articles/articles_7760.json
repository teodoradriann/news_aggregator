    "text": "Jack Graham: Banned West Coast Eagle still in Adelaide amid ‘challenging time’ following homophobic slur\nJack Graham remains in South Australia amid the fallout from his homophobic slur, with West Coast granting the recruit leave in the first week of his four-match suspension.\nGraham copped a hefty ban from the AFL after admitting to using an inappropriate word directed toward a GWS player during their clash at Optus Stadium earlier this month.\nThe revelation of the 27-year-old’s discretion emerged on Sunday morning just hours before the Eagles’ loss to Port Adelaide.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\nWest Coast coach Andrew McQualter confirmed on Thursday that Graham had been given the opportunity to remain in South Australia with family after the incident, having travelled with the team in the lead-in to Sunday’s game.\n“We’ve given Jack a few days away,” he said.\n“He’s staying with some family for a little bit of time.\n“He is going OK. It’s a challenging time for him and other people as well within our organisation and society so we challenge Jack’s behaviour but we’ll support the person.”\nIt is Graham’s first year at the Eagles after they recruited the two-time Richmond premiership midfielder on a four-year deal, along with long-time teammate Liam Baker.\nIt is not yet clear whether Graham will be back at the club ahead of their clash against his former side at Optus Stadium on Saturday night.\nWest Coast have defended the process undertaken which resulted in a suspension to Graham despite widespread criticism, including from former coach Adam Simpson.\n“Why isn’t this decided on Monday or Tuesday, like everything else is decided by Monday or Tuesday, like tribunals, indiscretions, all these types of things, especially when the game is on a Friday?” Simpson said.\nFormer AFL coach and West Coast and North Melbourne player Danielle Laidley warned of the dangers of homophobic language in football.\n“I have walked both roads. I have walked as a competitive AFL footballer, and sometimes some things are said and they shouldn’t be,” she told The West Australian.\n“But I am also part of the transgender community, and I know when I was playing football, if there was a conversation about ‘who was the gay footballer’ that would give me really bad anxiety, and I would withdraw and think ‘oh my God, do people know about me?’\n“It is a shame that it has happened, but we must continue to support and educate people and that’s what we need to do.”\nOriginally published on The West Australian",

    "text": "Art and music exhibitions, film screenings, climate change conversations and sauna sessions will be part of the eighth-annual Great Northern Festival. The festival begins Thursday at Malcolm Yards in Minneapolis and runs until Feb. 2.\nKate Nordstrum, chief programming officer, said the mix of topics and mediums is part of this festival’s mission. “We feel like a festival that celebrates our unique winter culture needs to acknowledge that our winters are changing, and we are adapting as a festival and as a people,” she said.\nThe Great Northern Festival is about bringing people together during Minnesota winters, which can be an isolating time for many. The goal is to offer opportunities to get outside and be in a community.\nThe 10-day festival involves Minnesota-based and non-local artists. Nordstrum said that 82 Minnesota artists, speakers, chefs and other creative talent will be featured in the 2025 festival.\n“We ask Minnesota artists to use the Great Northern as a platform for big ideas that can launch here and that we can help them export,” Nordstrum said. For artists from beyond the state, Nordstrum said the festival can be a platform for them to be introduced to the community.\nGreat Northern at launch For the launch on Jan. 23 at Malcolm Yards, there will be free food on a first-come first-serve basis provided by Wrecktangle Pizza, as well as a signature s’mores-themed cocktail. Admission to the event is free, but they require you to RSVP to secure your spot.\nThe event will be emceed by The Current’s Zach McCormick, who will offer a Prince-inspired tracklist to begin an outdoor showing of the Minnesota artist’s “Sign O’ The Times” concert film. This will be projected onto the United Crushers building at 7 p.m.\nThe Malcolm Yards parking lot has been temporarily repurposed to house 22 saunas providing steaming sessions over the 10-day festival. Sauna-seekers can purchase tickets separately.\nIn partnership with Melanin in Motion, there will also be a special BIPOC Community Steam hosted on Saturday at 6:30 p.m. that is focused on incorporating wellness and respite, as sauna-goers embrace the steamy warmth and wintery cold.\nOther sauna events hosted by the “saunapreneurs,” as Nordstrum refers to sauna innovators, include a forest bathing paired with a sauna session, 5K with Fleet Feet followed by the sauna, a library sauna in partnership with Milkweed Publishing and an art sauna brought by Art Spin.\n“I love how what we started three years ago with the sauna village is evolving to really be a fuller reflection of our culture and what the festival loves,” Nordstrum said.\nThe celebration continues with the Minnesota debut of Jeremy Dutcher at Icehouse on Friday, Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. A two-spirit artist from the Tobique First Nation in Canada, Dutcher has become internationally renowned for his genre-blended neoclassical, jazz and pop music. He’s dedicated to language revitalization in his work which combines Wolastoqey, English and French.\nThen on Saturday, the first of two Family Days will be held at 10:30 a.m. Family-friendly sauna sessions will be held with lowered temperatures, as well as tap water sampling and free outdoor games.\nA person listens to the MPR Steam Stream in the Sauna Village at the Great Northern Festival at Malcolm Yards in Minneapolis in 2024. MPR photo Here is the tea There will also be a block-party-style celebration of a public art installation by Twin Cities-based artist Eric Rieger, also known as HOTTEA, a name inspired by a memory of his mother who always ordered hot tea. The HOTTEA project is about love and bringing people from different backgrounds together, said Rieger.\nRieger’s festival piece, called “Stories,” is inspired by conversations he had with community members who live or work along East Lake Street.\n“I really want to try and stay true to where HOTTEA started,” Rieger said. “I really wanted to collaborate with the community and hear their stories and highlight the community itself.”\nThe piece incorporates yarn dipped in resin, a concept Rieger has been toying with for years. The resin creates a more permanent exhibit that weathers the elements. It moves in unison in the wind, something that Rieger describes as looking like a sea anemone.\nWatch HOTTEA’s art installation with The Great Northern Festival, video courtesy of HOTTEA: This 40-by-40-foot, site-specific installation includes an estimated 9,000 strands of 11 colors, all UV black light responsive. Rieger said he was interested in making the piece a dynamic experience any time of the day.\n“They’re translucent, but they still have color, and the sun travels through them, but then they glisten,” Rieger said. “Then at night, we have black light and other lighting that activates the neon.”\nRieger and his team have been working on the piece for months, including record-breakingly cold days.\n“I feel like the sense of wanting to create something beautiful for the community and for myself and for all the people that are involved just kind of took over,” Rieger said. “To be asked to be part of the Great Northern festival, I definitely feel like I’m being accepted and it feels really great to just be asked to present my artwork for the Twin Cities.”\nHear him speak about his piece with DJ Walter “Q Bear” Banks of 89.9 FM KMOJ Radio at 5 p.m. Saturday at 730 East Lake St.\nThe Great Northern Climate Solutions Series is hosting conversations over the weekend with climate activists, artists and business leaders as we address climate change and environmental concerns. Tickets for these sessions are sold out, but standby tickets are available.\nMPR News meteorologists Sven Sundgaard, Paul Huttner and Mandy Thalhuber will staff an Ask the Meteorologist Booth to answer weather-related questions.\nSee the whole list of events at The Great Northern Festival .",
