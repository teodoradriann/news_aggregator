Stalin is offering a 3-month free recharge to everyone, along with an online link, is circulating on social media as a New Year announcement. Cybercrime police have issued a warning, urging people not to fall for such fraudulent advertisements. Cybercriminals, using the names of prominent organizations, lure people with enticing advertisements and send links through which they gain unauthorized access to bank accounts. Such scams have led to monetary theft from unsuspecting individuals. Recently, similar scams were reported with fake advertisements bearing Prime Minister Modi’s image, falsely promoting government schemes. Now, a fraudulent message in the name of Chief Minister Stalin is making rounds on social media platforms. The fake message reads, “New Year Recharge Offer: On the occasion of New Year, Chief Minister Stalin is providing a free 2-month recharge worth ₹749.” It includes an online link for users to claim the offer. Cybercrime police have cautioned the public that clicking on such links can lead to unauthorized access to mobile numbers and bank accounts linked to them, resulting in potential monetary theft. They have advised people to be vigilant and avoid believing or engaging with such fraudulent advertisements.

    "title": "Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Devs Detail Improvements to Foliage, NPC Behaviour, and More",
    "text": "With Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered set to launch later this month, with an update on the PlayStation Blog , developer Nixxes Software has revealed new technical details on some of the way ways it has attempted to enhance and update the 2017 title.\nFor starters, the studio says players can expect much denser vegetation and foliage throughout the game’s world. That, of course, was a key characteristic of Horizon Zero Dawn’s map to begin with, but it seems like Nixxes Software has attempted to bring the game up to the same level of quality in this area as its 2022 sequel, Horizon Forbidden West .\n“To bring the foliage in the remaster up to the same level of quality as in Horizon Forbidden West , we enhanced the shaders, textures, geometry and foliage interaction,” said senior environment artist Patrick Blankenzee. “We assessed all the foliage assets in Horizon Zero Dawn and upgraded them with all these new features. We did this for hundreds of plants, bushes, flowers and trees.\n“We looked at the biomes in the original game and compared them to the concept art. We found places that we could enhance and bring closer to the original intent, with the rainforest biome being a good example of this. With powerful procedural technology, we injected new foliage and raised the quality and density to new heights. The riverbanks have also been upgraded with more biodiversity to bring them closer to the original intention as seen in the concept art.”\nEnvironment artist Julian Hofman added, “Working with the original team over at Guerrilla, we were able to ask questions , and directly compare their latest work on Horizon Forbidden West to the work we were doing for the remaster. This gave us some very specific goals to work towards, like the fresh generation of moss that you can now see Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.\n“For me, the foliage changes make the game feel more alive and make it live up to the incredibly high standards of the Horizon games. The result is a coherent world to replay or experience for the first time.”\nAnother area where Nixxes Software has done a fair amount of work is with NPCs and the way they behave. In a nutshell, players can expect towns, cities, and settlements to look and feel more densely packed, while NPCs will now behave in more natural and varied ways, making the world feel more alive.\n“We reviewed all villages, outposts and cities, identifying areas that felt empty or where we could improve realism and immersion,” said senior technical game designer Brian van Nunen. “Building the game for PS5 allowed us to leverage the increased amount of memory available, enabling us to significantly boost the number of non-player characters. We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfil their needs. We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations.”\nSimilar to the foliage and vegetation, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered has also looked to bring itself up to the same level of quality as Forbidden West with the assets it uses for terrain, objects, buildings, and the like.\n“We began by replacing all the Horizon Zero Dawn terrain materials with their new Horizon Forbidden West counterparts,” said senior technical artist Sander Bronkhorst. “This was only the first step, as the sequel’s terrain materials didn’t always align with the original aesthetics. To address this, we carefully tweaked and polished each individual terrain material to closely match the look and feel of the original game, while maintaining the visual fidelity of the terrain materials in Horizon Forbidden West.\n“In addition to updating all the terrain textures and materials, we incorporated features like deformable snow and sand. Snow deformation was first introduced in the Frozen Wilds expansion, but in the remaster, you will find this feature outside that area as well.”\nBronkhorst added, “We performed a separate pass on all the man-made Building Blocks, creating new high-resolution geometry for assets that would benefit from this. We found that buildings greatly benefited from having more detailed geometry, as most were using brick-like textures on the walls without the shape of the bricks being reflected in the geometry.\n“To address this, we developed custom tools for generating more detailed geometry for these buildings. The artists used these tools to create new geometry, then manually tweaked and adjusted each individual building for the best visual result.”\nOn top of that, the remaster will also feature over 10 hours of new motion capture animations for its conversations, in addition to enhanced lighting. Read more on that through here .\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches for PS5 and PC on October 31.",

    "title": "Samantha Power, who wrote a book on genocide, confronted by own USAID staff for failing to speak out on Gaza",
    "text": "USAID Administrator Samantha Power arrives to a news conference, in Guatemala City\nThe head of the United States Agency for International Development was publicly criticized by the agency’s current and former employees who urged her to speak out against US support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.\nAgnieszka Sykes, a global health specialist at USAID who told The Washington Post that she left her job at the agency last week, had interrupted a speech on “The End of Climate Shocks” at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg Center.\n“You wrote a book on genocide and you’re still working for the administration: You should resign and speak out,” Ms Sykes said.\nDuring a question-answer segment after her remarks, Hannah Funk, who identified herself as a contract specialist at USAID, told Ms Power: “The US-funded genocide in Gaza has really left us unable to be more of a leader in climate change and all the other development in humanitarian issues those of us in USAID care so much about. How are you leading us to reckon with and overcome this hypocrisy?”\nAs Joe Biden’s administration and members of Congress face internal dissent challenging US support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Ms Power is overseeing a sprawling international aid agency divided over US military support for the war amid growing calls for a ceasefire.\nMs Power’s book questions why American leadership has failed to stop global atrocities after vowing “never again”. In her statements on Tuesday, Ms Power underscored the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and inadequate supplies of food, water and medical supplies for 2 million displaced Palestinians.\n“We have families right now living in unimaginable conditions. In addition, the greatest loss of life has come from the war itself, and from the bombing. More than 25,000 civilians have been killed,” she said.\n“There is not a single call that President Biden makes … that doesn’t put the importance of civilian protection and international humanitarian law at the top of the conversations,” she added.\nShe also appeared to defend Israel’s military actions, stating that “the people who carried out October 7 would do it again, in a heartbeat, if they could,” referencing the Hamas-led attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel.\n“And, that fundamental fact, makes it impossible for us to look at the situation and say that it can’t happen again,” she added. “When Hamas leadership is at large, those same kinds of attacks, the same kind of hostage-taking, the same kind of sexual assault, that can happen again. And so, we have had within USAID, a lot of discussion, and I very much hear and completely respect the views across the agency.”\nA series of protests and dissent memos among administration staffers included a November letter from more than 1,000 USAID officials urging the Biden administration to call for an immediate ceasefire.\nSimilar efforts from members of Mr Biden’s staff and presidential re-election campaign, as well as staff among members of Congress and across federal agencies, have repeatedly called on the president and congressional leadership to support calls for a ceasefire.\nOn Wednesday, a federal judge in California called on the president, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to “examine the results of their unflagging support of the military siege against the Palestinians in Gaza.”\nThe judge noted that a preliminary ruling from the International Court of Justice found that Israel’s conduct in Gaza could plausibly amount to genocide.\nMs Power told the audience at Johns Hopkins that the agency and the Biden administration are “working aggressively now to secure a humanitarian pause that would allow a respite from the war to allow the release of hostages and a “dramatic increase in the scale of supplies to get in Gaza.”\n“Civilian life, human life, is sacred. Just as the horror that was inflicted on October 7 galvanised outrage, so it is important that we mobilize everything we can, in terms of diplomatic resources, humanitarian resources, to reach the needs of families,” she said.\nIn a statement to The Independent, a spokesperson for USAID said Ms Power and the agency’s leadership “are deeply engaged with our workforce, who work tirelessly to support vulnerable people in Gaza and around the world.”\n“Since the start of this conflict, Administrator Power and other agency leadership have held numerous engagements with staff in the US and at USAID Missions around the world to discuss the US and USAID response to the conflict, offer appreciation for their work, and hear a range of perspectives and concerns,” the statement added.\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Attackers use platforms such as YouTube and social media to share download links for fake installers to capitalize on user trust and drive clicks to malicious sites.\n- Threat actors often use reputable file hosting services like Mediafire and Mega.nz to conceal the origin of their malware and make detection and removal more difficult.\n- Many malicious downloads are password-protected and encoded, which complicates analysis in security environments such as sandboxes and allows malware to evade early detection.\n- Once infected, malware collects sensitive data from web browsers to steal credentials. This situation shows the serious risks of exposing your personal information by unknowingly downloading fraudulent software.\nIntroduction\nThe increase of fake installers bundled with info stealers is a growing threat for users looking for pirated software. These malicious programs disguise themselves as legitimate applications, often appearing in search results or [comments on platforms like GitHub](https://www.gendigital.com/blog/news/innovation/lumma-stealer-github). Unfortunately, many users fall prey to these tricks. The [Trend Micro™ Managed XDR](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/services/managed-xdr.html) service frequently sees the fallout, with the Lumma stealer being a prominent example. This highlights the hidden dangers of piracy that can jeopardize personal security and data integrity.\nInfo stealers are a type of malware that is designed to steal sensitive information from an infected system. This can include credentials, financial information, personal data, and other sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes.\nHow they lure their victims\nInfo stealers operate deceptively, luring victims into downloading the malware disguised as legitimate software installers. These download links often originate from fake websites or are shared as a link in messages from social platforms, as discussed in our [previous blog](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/j/beware-lumma-stealer-distributed-via-discord-cdn-.html).\nIn this blog, we want to highlight and break down how a typical user may stumble upon these download links of fake installers.\nVictims are lured into piracy by individuals posing as guides on popular video-sharing platforms like YouTube. These deceitful actors create a pretense of offering legitimate software installation tutorials to entice viewers to click on malicious links in the video descriptions or comments. This compromises users' devices and promotes a culture of theft. Here is an example.\nUpon accessing the link, a separate post on YouTube opens, revealing the download link for the fake installer.\nIn the following example, it leads to a download of the file from the Mediafire file hosting site:\nIn another case, the threat was uploaded to another file-hosting site called Mega.nz.\nIt's clear that the threat utilizes known file hosting services as another layer to obscure its download further and evade detection.\nIn the cases we will discuss in this blog, we observed that these threats are often distributed as fake installers or cracked software, which victims inadvertently encounter while searching for them on search engines.\nIn the sample below, specific keywords trigger search results for these entries.\nThe third item in the search results (refer to screenshot above) comes from OpenSea (an NFT marketplace), which is unusual because it hosted a downloadable file. The entry contains a shortened link that redirects to the actual link. One assumption is that they use shortened links to prevent scraping sites from accessing the download link.\nThe following link will prompt you for the actual download link and the zip file's password. Password-protecting the files can help prevent sandbox analysis of the initial file upon arrival, which can be a quick win for an adversary.\nThe fourth and last entry in the search results (refer to the search results screenshot above) came from SoundCloud, a music-sharing platform that hosted the download link with a corresponding description. In this case, the download link was shortened using Twitter.\nThe same user also posted additional entries that include means to download a specific file.\nContent from another entry made by the same user.\nSimilar to the first case, another site displays the download link and password.\nIn one of our download links, we discovered evidence of other entries they are attempting to fake, as shown in VirusTotal (VT).\nInfection analysis as seen by Managed XDR (post download)\nIn the next section, we will discuss instances where the download was successful and the content was executed. This case sample highlights the activities observed on the host.\nCase 1\nOne observation about the unpacked file is that its size is 900 MB. This large file size helps defense evasion and allows it to bypass sandbox analysis to appear more legitimate as an installer. Moreover, it is restricted from submission in VT.\nThe infection sequence is triggered upon executing the .exe file contained within the zip file.\nA threat has been detected involving the execution of batch files. The content of the batch file was sourced and, while different from the Managed XDR case, is still functionally similar.\nThe batch file contains obfuscated entries.\nThe first cleanup involves removing garbage entries.\nThe next step is to replace the variables, resulting in a clearer script.\nAccording to the batch file, it builds the AutoIt script by combining the multiple created files and executes it. Upon execution, we observed that it dropped several additional files.\nProcesses may be injected with its code, and a new legitimate binary is sometimes introduced for process injection.\nCollecting and preparing sensitive data from browser environments for credential access was completed through a copy file operation.\nThe process introduced by threat is also seen to establish connections to multiple command and control (C&C) addresses.\nBesides accessing its C&C, our investigation observed the threat committing a series of queries related to Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) domains.\nCase 2\nIn this second case, the infection started when a user downloaded a compressed file from a known file hosting site. Once downloaded, the user unpacks the file, which would require a password, and executes the installer. Upon execution, it proceeds to do a series of suspicious events, such as spawning a legitimate process and injecting its code into it. The threat also introduces a known scripting tool, AutoIt, to further obfuscate its execution, and later, it connects to its C&C to download and execute additional malware, typically different variants of infostealer.\nA snippet of the content of the zip file shows that, at a quick glance, it is just a standard application installer.\nSetup.exe is a version of rustdesk.exe, an open-source remote desktop access software identified on VirusTotal.\nThe zip file contains a trojanized file for rustdesk.exe, where one of the DLLs is tampered with. For this specific sample, the tampered DLL that was loaded by Setup.exe was flutter_gpu_texture_renderer_plugin.dll.\nWhen the file is executed, it displays an error but is already running in the background.\nIn the background, the following events have already taken place.\nInjecting malicious code into legitimate binaries, such as more.com, StrCmp.exe, SearchIndexer.exe, and explorer.exe, to evade detection by security defenses.\nIt drops additional files that are information stealers or malware from a different family.\nCreates autorun registry entry and scheduled tasks to ensure ongoing persistence.\nInjected processes were later observed, which initiated C&C communication.\nBundle of Stealers/Loaders\nThis time, it's not just a single info stealer but an army of recent noisy ones. This is not new, as it was also observed before with [raccoon stealers](https://threatpost.com/raccoon-stealer-google-seo/168301/).\nObserved stealers in the cases:\n- LUMMASTEALER\n- PRIVATELOADER\n- MARSSTEALER\n- AMADEY\n- PENGUISH\n- VIDAR\nRecap of the different methods of defense evasion observed in the case:\n- Utilization of large file size – a means to bypass sandbox capabilities\n- A password-protected zip file hinders content scanning and can complicate investigations if the password is unavailable.\n- The files are uploaded to known media-sharing sites, which most antivirus programs would only detect if the exact link is discovered before the download.\n- In some cases, download links are shortened, preventing scraping from sites.\n- The operation uses legitimate files and employs DLL sideloading or process injection to execute its payload.\nHow Managed XDR helps in the case of an info-stealer infection from fake installers\nDefense-in-depth is an important strategy that organizations use to protect their environments. In situations where a threat might have evaded some of these defense layers, Managed XDR can detect these incidents in real time. It offers the necessary analysis and actions to effectively contain the threat.\n- Threat hunting and human analyst augmented alerting - Some activities may not be captured by alerts or could generate low-severity alerts, which Trend Vision One users might overlook. Threat hunting proactively searches for known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) or emerging threats, ensuring that alerts are issued. Additionally, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) analysts can determine whether certain detections require further attention from the customer, reducing the burden on Trend Vision One users to check every alert.\n- Understanding the context of the alert – When a threat activity generates a detection, further correlation is necessary to provide context and capture the complete narrative of the events. Upon linking our findings to the initial alert, it becomes evident that most of the findings in the draft are not included in a single alert or detection. Additionally, some instances lack any related detection and were only connected through further investigation using the search application. As illustrated in the case findings shared earlier, these insights are obtained through the MXDR analyst's deeper investigation of the initial triggers, which may include threat hunting or alerts generated from a workbench.\n- Implementing response actions – As the fake installer infection progresses, MXDR analysts can initiate response actions to contain the threat on behalf of the customer. In the case we are dealing with, we have isolated the affected machines to prevent further spread. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) have been added to the Suspicions Objects (SO) list to block any additional execution, and the suspicious files have been submitted to the analysis team for accurate detection.\nConclusion\nThreat actors continue to use social engineering tactics to target its victims and apply different methods to avoid security defenses, including: DLL sideloading, using large installer files, password-protected ZIP files, process injection into legitimate processes, connections to legitimate websites, and creating copies of files and renaming them to appear benign.\nIt is important to stay updated on current threats and to remain vigilant regarding detection and alert systems. Visibility is important because solely relying on detection can result in many malicious activities going unnoticed. Organizations should consider the following to stay ahead of these threats:\n- Implement a multi-layered defense approach for in-depth defense.\n- Provide user education.\n- Establish an incident response plan.\n- Engage in threat hunting.\n- Use a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).\nOrganizations can take advantage of [Trend Vision One™ – Endpoint Security](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/endpoint-security.html) for prevention, detection, and response for user endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and data centers.\nManaged XDR offers a 24/7 managed detection and response (MDR) for email, endpoint, server, cloud workloads, and networks from our world-class MDR team\nTrend Vision One Threat Intelligence\nTo stay ahead of evolving threats, Trend Micro customers can also access a range of Intelligence Reports and Threat Insights within [Trend Vision One](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/one-platform.html). Threat Insights helps customers stay ahead of cyber threats before they happen and be better prepared for emerging threats.

    "text": "Weather Update: Red Alert For Dense Fog In Delhi; Several Trains Cancelled, Over 100 Flights Delayed\nA red alert has been sounded in Delhi for Friday, along with an orange alert for December 30 and a yellow alert for the year-end and New Year’s Eve, as per the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The region, along with North India, is grappling with mist and dense fog, disrupting travel and causing accidents.\nThe widespread fog has resulted in transportation challenges, affecting both train and air travel. On Thursday, low visibility impacted railway services, resulting in delays for 22 Delhi-bound trains.\nAt the Delhi airport, 134 flights, encompassing both domestic and international routes, faced delays on the previous day. Among them, 35 international departures and 28 international arrivals were affected, along with 43 domestic departures and 28 domestic arrivals.\nThe latest INSAT imagery from the Meteorological Department revealed a dense fog layer covering northern regions of India, including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and northwest Madhya Pradesh.\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) extended its warning, projecting dense fog over Haryana and Punjab for the next five days. Uttar Pradesh is expected to experience similar conditions for the next three days, prompting the UP State Road Transport Corporation to issue guidelines for bus operations during periods of low visibility.\nIMD has issued a warning of dense fog persisting until December 31, with visibility ranging from 199 meters to 50 meters or even less. The meteorological department attributes the foggy conditions to an active Western Disturbance, predicting a partly cloudy sky on Friday.\nThursday marked the coldest day of the season in Delhi, with the maximum temperature recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest of the season. UP CM Yogi Adityanath had to postpone his Ayodhya visit due to the adverse weather conditions.\nIn response to the adverse weather, schools in Noida and Greater Noida are closed on December 29 and 30 for all classes. In Mathura, schools for classes one to eight will open at 10 am and close at 3 pm. Most districts in Haryana and Punjab experienced a day without sunshine.\nThe Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported Delhi’s 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 358 on Thursday. This follows an earlier reading of 445 on Saturday morning, with specific areas like Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, and Bawana witnessing deplorable air quality conditions. The prevailing AQI categorizes Delhi’s air quality as “very poor” and “severe,” highlighting the persistent challenge of pollution in the region.",

    "text": "Payday ringed on a calendar\nInvestors seeking passive income or those depending on their investments to cover their living expenses could findÂ dividend stocksÂ attractive. Thankfully, the TSX has numerousÂ fundamentally strongÂ income stocks, such asÂ EnbridgeÂ andÂ Fortis, that have been consistently paying and increasing their dividends for decades. Their solid payouts and resilient business model make them attractive passive-income stocks.Â\nHowever, Iâll focus on shares of companies that offer monthly payouts. These stocks boost your monthly income and enhance liquidity. Also, it enables you to reinvest the dividends in stocks, allowing you to accumulate more shares and create wealth over time.Â\nWith this background, letâs look at a top Canadian stock paying monthly dividends.\nThe 7.5% dividend stock offering monthly cash Among the TSX stocks that offer monthly payouts, SmartCentres Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX:SRU.UN) stands out for its solid dividend payment history, high-quality assets, and compelling yield.\nOperating as an integrated REIT (real estate investment trust), SmartCentres distributes a significant portion of its earnings as dividends, making it an attractive choice for investors seeking passive income. Despite maintaining a notably high payout ratio, SmartCentres remains a reliable investment due to its consistent track record of paying dividends and occasionally increasing the same.\nThe REIT currently provides a monthly dividend yield of $0.154 per share, translating to a dividend yield of approximately 7.5% based on its closing price of $24.53 on December 22.\nFactors that make SmartCentres a reliable bet The primary reasons to invest in SmartCentres stock are its stellar dividend payment history and high yield. Further, investors should note that SmartCentres owns resilient real estate assets that consistently generate strong same-properties NOI (net operating income) in all market conditions. This helps SmartCentres cover its payouts easily and consistently enhance its shareholdersâ returns via regular payouts.Â\nAs of September 30, SmartCentres had ownership interests in 191 properties, focusing predominantly on retail properties. These strategically positioned assets, located throughout prime Canadian locations, experience strong demand. Overall, SmartCentres commands total assets of $12 billion and has 35 million square feet of gross leasable mixed-use space.\nWhat supports my bull case is that SmartCentres boasts a high-quality tenant base and remarkably high occupancy rate. This enables SmartCentres to generate stable cash flows to cover its payouts. Investors should note that SmartCentresâs retail portfolio has a 98.5% occupancy rate, which is encouraging. Furthermore, SmartCentres is relatively immune to the high interest rate environment as most of its debt is of fixed rate, enabling the REIT to navigate the interest rate scenario comfortably.Â\nBottom line SmartCentres is an attractive passive income stock offering monthly payouts. Its ability to generate recurring retail income, high occupancy rate, top-quality tenant base, and solid mixed-use properties development program position it well to generate reliable adjusted funds from operation and enhance its shareholdersâ value.\nBased on its current yield of approximately 7.5%, an investment of $10,000 in SmartCentres stock will enable investors to earn $750 /year in passive income.\nShould You Invest $1,000 In SmartCentres REIT?

    "text": "Foto: Igor do Vale/Ag. Paulistão Cruzeiro está na próxima fase da Copa SP\nOs garotos do Cruzeiro não deram chances ao Bahia e venceram por 3 a 0, em jogo das oitavas de final da Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior. A partida foi disputada no estádio Luisão, em São Carlos (SP).\nO time azul começou melhor e abriu o placar ainda no primeiro tempo. Na etapa complementar, o Cruzeiro ampliou o marcador e garantiu vaga nas quartas de final do torneio de base.\nAgora, os garotos aguardam o vencedor de Fluminense e São Paulo.\nPrimeiro tempo O Cruzeiro iniciou a partida com mais volume, buscando o jogo e criando oportunidades para marcar. Logo aos dois minutos, Janderson teve uma chance e forçou o goleiro a fazer uma grande defesa. Pouco depois, Kenji também teve a oportunidade, mas por pouco não conseguiu marcar. Aos 22 minutos, Felipe Morais abriu o placar com um belo gol. O Bahia tentou responder, mas não conseguia romper a defesa celeste e sofria com os avanços do time mineiro.\nSegundo tempo O Bahia voltou com mais vontade para a etapa final. Após a derrota no primeiro tempo, o time foi mais agressivo e se lançou ao ataque, buscando a classificação.\nNo entanto, o Cruzeiro passou a jogar de forma inteligente, esperando o Tricolor em seu campo. Aos 34 minutos, a Raposa ampliou a vantagem: em um contra-ataque rápido, Nicolas recebeu pela direita e marcou o segundo gol.\nAos 40 minutos, em uma boa jogada, Fernandinho recebeu a bola dentro da área e, de letra, fez o terceiro e deu números finais ao confronto.\nSiga nosso conteúdo nas redes sociais: Bluesky , Threads , Twitter , Instagram e Facebook .",
