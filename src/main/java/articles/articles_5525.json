    "text": "Dólar sobe para R$ 6 e bolsa tem a maior queda em quase dois anos\nIbovespa cai 2,74% com alta de juros além do esperado\nO dólar à vista voltou a superar a marca de R$ 6 nesta quinta-feira (12), após uma alta de 0,69%, cotado a R$ 6,0091. Durante o dia, a moeda norte-americana chegou a atingir R$ 6,04, refletindo um movimento de valorização impulsionado pela pressão de importadores. No entanto, a cotação da moeda flutuou, operando inicialmente em baixa, com o valor chegando a R$ 5,92 logo após a abertura dos negócios.\nA pressão sobre o câmbio ocorreu mesmo com a intervenção do Banco Central, que, pela manhã, vendeu US$ 4 bilhões das reservas internacionais, com o compromisso de recomprar a moeda em alguns meses. Essa foi a primeira atuação do BC no mercado de câmbio em um mês, tentando conter a valorização do dólar.\nNo mercado de ações, o clima foi mais pessimista. O Ibovespa, principal índice da bolsa brasileira, registrou uma queda de 2,74%, fechando aos 126.042 pontos. Esta foi a maior queda diária desde 2 de janeiro de 2023, refletindo o impacto da decisão do Copom (Comitê de Política Monetária) de elevar a taxa Selic em 1 ponto percentual, de 11,25% para 12,25% ao ano. A elevação da taxa de juros causou nervosismo no mercado, pressionando os investidores a migrarem para ativos de renda fixa, considerados menos arriscados.\nA decisão do BC surpreendeu parte do mercado, que esperava um aumento mais moderado da Selic, para 12% ao ano.",

    "text": "Striking bin workers may face losing jobs - council\nStriking Birmingham bin workers who have \"declined all offers on the table\" may face compulsory redundancy, the city council has warned.\nIt comes as talks between the authority and union Unite to resolve the all-out industrial action, which started on 11 March, broke down without agreement.\nUnite claims planned restructuring of the refuse service will see some 50 workers lose £8,000 a year, and about 20 lose £2,000 per annum, and says a consultation over redundancies is \"disgraceful\".\nBut the authority, which disputes the figures, said: \"This is about securing a better waste service. We thank staff... and recognise the frustration of residents, for which we apologise.\"\nThere is a discrepancy between the council and the union over how many staff the restructuring would affect, but the number lies between 70 and 76.\n\"It is regrettable that it has come to [potential redundancies], the council has consistently tried to find a solution to the industrial action,\" the authority said in a statement.\n\"We have made a very fair offer, which means that no worker need lose any money. That offer remains open.\"\nHowever, the union said the council was \"refusing to discuss the issue that we are are in dispute over\".\n\"They have still given no explanation around why there is a so-called equal pay issue, and that's fundamental to this,\" said Onay Kasab, Unite's national lead officer.\n\"Potentially, we are talking about 72 people, but we will make sure that the council does not go ahead with that process,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They have said that nobody will lose any money out of this, and we know now... that people are going to be losing money, not only that, but we know what their attitude is.\"\nMr Kasab added that if staff are made redundant it would mean the dispute would be extended.\nRats on streets\nIn its statement, the Labour-run city council said all staff had been offered alternative employment at the same pay, and almost three-quarters of staff had taken the offer or taken voluntary redundancy.\n\"There are now 41 workers who have declined any offer, and 35 workers who opted for valuable and skilled driver training, who have also told us via a letter from Unite that they are working under protest,\" it said.\nThe negotiations are due to begin again on Monday.\nThe industrial action has now been going on for the best part of three months, and images of rubbish piling up on the streets of Birmingham have been seen around the world.\nResidents have complained about bad smells, and there have been reports of rats in the streets, as piles of bin bags continue to grow.\nCouncillor Majid Mahmood, who this week resigned from Unite after the union failed to condemn reported violence on picket lines, said the bin collection service was in need of modernisation.\n\"I share the frustration of residents. I understand they're fed up,\" he said. \"I'm a born and bred Brummie.\n\"I have not had a collection for a fortnight myself, but we have put contingencies in place to try to support residents during this industrial action.\n\"We've extended the hours of the household recycling centres so they can book a slot online and attend the centre to dispose of waste.\"\n\"My message is to Unite - please work with us. We're willing to work around the clock to resolve this.\"\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "title": "7 Tips for Embracing Change In Your Life",
    "text": "In a sea of change, sailing with the tide will carry you in a positive new direction.\nLife is full of change. Whether you ask for it or not, you can choose to be a resistor or an embracer of change.\nNow, I know that many of you with traditional beliefs may find the idea of changes in morality to be concerning. I share that sentiment in many ways.\nThe kinds of changes I’m talking about are more practical and circumstantial. There is certainly a time and place for standing against the tides of societal drift, but even then, there may be wisdom in learning to accept what you cannot control and redirect your efforts in the more malleable areas.\nWhy have I chosen to be an embracer of change?\nIt comes down to optimism versus pessimism. Pessimistic people often long for the way things used to be. They primarily offer nostalgia, which may have resulted from a different context. They don’t typically have constructive ideas for how to build something new—only the desire to keep things the same.\nOptimists, on the other hand, build the future and shape it as they’d like it to be. They acknowledge change as an opportunity to make things better and are willing to endure the discomfort of transition for the sake of having a voice at the table.\nRelated Stories\nIf you’d like to take a more proactive role in shaping your life or increase your own sense of agency, consider these simple tips for learning to embrace change.\n7 Steps to Embrace Change 1. Keep an Open Mind The first step toward accepting change is to hold back your initial skepticism. I try to do this by imagining the good that could come from change. No system or plan is perfect, so you may find something you like even better.\n2. Focus on the Positives of the New Situation In a similar sense, choose to focus your attention on the aspects of a change that you appreciate. When my old company was combined with a new company, I knew that certain colleagues I enjoyed would be moving on, but instead of dwelling on that, I focused on the fact that I would be able to work from home and have more time with my family.\n3. Learn to Accept What You Can’t Control\nThere’s a time and place to push back against changes coming your way. But I’m emphasizing embracing change that is happening whether you like it or not. In that sense, I’ve found more inner peace from intentionally letting go of anything I can’t control. I just don’t give those things any space in my mind.\n4. Give Yourself and Others Time to Adjust When you start something new, it often feels a little difficult and strange. That feeling won’t last forever. Eventually, you’ll get used to new things and become better at them, you may even come to enjoy them. That’s why giving yourself time before coming to a final judgment is best.\n5. Leverage Change for Your Ends Now that change has come your way, what will you do? Maybe you’ve developed a food intolerance that makes your current eating pattern unworkable. Instead of sulking and shifting your diet to mere compliance, consider taking the opportunity to reinvent your diet altogether to one that is healthier and more enjoyable.\n6. Quickly Readjust Your Goals and Expectations Most of us are working toward several goals at any given time, and have a set of expectations about what our life will look like in the future. Change can disrupt these plans. Instead of clinging to what made sense before, make a fresh start and reevaluate your life from a new perspective. Change is life’s way of keeping us from complacency, and we can be better off.\n7. Assess What Can Be Learned and Preserved Just because something changes doesn’t mean you have to give up what you learned or liked about the way things were before. Having children has significantly reshaped how my wife and I spend our time, but we still go on childless dates and overnight trips to preserve something of those early days when it was just the two of us.\nChange doesn’t have to be an enemy. We’re occasionally given moments in life when we can choose what happens, but more often, we’re swept up in changes that will happen regardless of how we feel about them. In those times, embracing change maximizes your chances of being happy and exerting some influence on how things ultimately end up. It’s a path I wholeheartedly recommend.\nSource link",

But even when we qualified for the AFCON, we crashed out very early the last time. And so we haven’t given up on you.\n“We still believe that the Black Stars can find its glory again.

And so it takes sacrifice. It takes strength. We all like to watch you when you play for your teams, and we expect that you bring some of that dedication to the national team.” he said.\nThe Black Stars are set to face Chad on March 21 before playing Madagascar three days later in Morocco as they aim to keep their World Cup qualification hopes alive.",
