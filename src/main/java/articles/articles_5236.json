    "text": "Man celebrates last day of work after 48 years at supermarket chain WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - For an Iowa man, the start of 2024 will bring a lot of change to his normal routine as he retires from supermarket chain Hy-Vee after almost five decades. It’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around, but after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and his boss insisted on the special ride to work. Outside the West Des Moines supermarket was a display celebrating Mick’s years of service. “That’s amazing,” Mick said. “Wow. It’s about all I can say.” Inside the store, countless hugs and congratulations from family, friends and former colleagues showed the impact Mick had on the community. He started at Hy-Vee behind the meat counter in 1975 when he was just 16. “He’s the same person today: extremely nice, extremely thoughtful, willing to help the customers,” longtime colleague Marilyn Cook said. “He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” said Mick’s daughter, Kerri Driscoll. Mick worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career, his last being the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway. “It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul, and it’s been well worth it.” As the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at Mick’s party is a hint as to what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family. “I’m going to let life happen to me, enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said. Mick’s co-workers say he will be missed after bringing smiles to people during his nearly five decades on the job. Copyright 2024 KCCI via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Mérida (México) – A chuva que tem atrapalhado os últimos dias no WTA 250 de Mérida fez duas vítimas na rodada de quinta-feira. As russas Alina Korneeva e Anna Blinkova não conseguiram entrar em quadra, no único jogo de oitavas que não foi disputado, e uma delas terá que encarar rodada dupla na sexta-feira. Quem acabou sendo a principal beneficiada foi a espanhola Sara Sorribes, que na noite de quinta bateu a italiana Lucrezia Stefanini com parciais de 6/4, 1/6 e 6/4. Ela se garantiu nas quartas e agora espera pela vencedora do duelo 100% russo, enfrentando uma rival que virá um pouco mais desgastada. Depois das vitórias da sérvia Nina Stojanovic e da russa Polina Kudermetova, a chuva interrompeu a rodada e [cancelou a partida de duplas da carioca Ingrid Martins](https://tenisbrasil.uol.com.br/ingrid-tem-jogo-adiado-e-so-estreia-no-mexico-nesta-sexta.html). Mais tarde, três partidas de simples ainda conseguiram ser disputadas, uma delas a de Sorribes. Além da espanhola, quem também conseguiu fechar o dia classificada para as quartas de final foram a turca Zeynep Sonmez e a tenista da casa Renata Zarazua, que fez valer a condição de cabeça de chave número 1 do torneio e seguiu adiante. Elas se enfrentam na sexta por um lugar na semi. Fechando o dia na quadra central, Zarazua levou um susto da polonesa Maja Chwalinska e saiu perdendo, mas depois buscou a virada e fechou o jogo com parciais de 2/6, 6/2 e 6/1. Um pouco antes, Sonmez derrotou em sets diretos a francesa Elsa Jacquemot com o placar final de 7/6 (7-3) e 6/3.",

    "title": "Venezuela to hold military exercises as British warship heads to Guyana | Your Local Guardian",
    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.

Hay empujones y manotazos. Una joven mujer intenta pedir espacio y grita “ya déjenlo por favor”. Al final un portazo comprueba que la policía logra llevar al capacitador al interior del Consejo Distrital 10, ubicado en el municipio de Zapopan, para mantenerlo a salvo.\nEs el primer día de cuatro en los que los 20 consejos distritales a lo largo de Jalisco realizan el conteo de cómputos distritales .\nEntérate | Instituto de Jalisco alerta sobre agresiones y personas armadas, presuntamente de Morena, en sus sedes por cómputos distritales\nLos simpatizantes de Morena permanecen afuera de las instalaciones electorales y justifican que ese mismo capacitador, al que se intentaba ahorcar, horas antes en ese miércoles 5 de junio, conducía una camioneta particular en la que intentaron trasladar una bolsa negra que fue sacada desde el Consejo Distrital y cuyo contenido eran boletas marcadas en favor de los candidatos guindas Pedro Kumamoto por Zapopan y Claudia Delgadillo por la gubernatura .\nCamioneta presuntamente para transportar las boletas. Foto: Siboney\nEn tanto, el IEPC denunció que durante el arranque de la jornada en las diferentes sedes que contabilizaban los cómputos distritales, registraron esta y otras agresiones e incidentes y por lo menos en la sede del municipio de Tequila se identificaron a personas armadas, presuntamente de Morena.\nEl instituto electoral reprobó la violencia contra el capacitador en el distrito 10 y explicó que en esa sede las boletas que salían de las instalaciones serían entregadas al Consejo Municipal para su escrutinio.\n“En todos los procesos electorales, los funcionarios de casilla por error colocan boletas donde no les corresponde. En este caso teníamos un grupo de boletas, un paquete electoral que le corresponden a Zapopan y a través de los protocolos de mecanismos de recolección de paquetes, nuestra obligación era entregarlo al consejo municipal… Entonces por un error humano del equipo del Consejo se llevan el paquete rompiendo una parte de la cadena de custodia y la gente que está afuera pensó que era una cosa indebida”, explica David Córtes, presidente del consejo distrital electoral 10.\nLee también | Morena pedirá recuento de votos en elección a gubernatura de Jalisco; denuncia que no le entregaron copias legibles de las actas\n“Error humano” en el PREP de Jalisco La acusación de intentar eliminar actas para beneficiar a Movimiento Ciudadano ocurre después de que el programa de resultados electorales preliminares (PREP) de Jalisco , a cargo del IEPC, tuviera lo que llamó “un error humano” en el que registró más de 200 mil votos a favor del candidato Kumamoto y luego cambió la cifra.\n“Se capturó un dato incorrecto, porque eran 230 mil votos, lo cual es totalmente imposible para una casilla, cada casilla puede recibir hasta 750 votos, lo sabemos todas y todos, ese error salió a la vista de inmediato y fue corregido”, explicó en su momento Paula Ramírez Höhne, presidenta del IEPC.\nTambién sucede tras la negativa de Claudia Delgadillo y Mario Delgado, dirigente nacional del partido, de aceptar una derrota por el 3% de los votos frente a Pablo Lemus de Movimiento Ciudadano para obtener la gubernatura.\nLa candidata guinda sostiene que hay una inconsistencia en el número de votos por lo que el partido impugnará las elecciones para hacer una revisión.\n“H acen falta infinidad de boletas en cada uno de los distritos, donde faltan un millón de votos que no se han contabilizado para la gubernatura, pues entonces yo estaré pidiendo que se haga un recuento voto a voto, casilla por casilla, porque no voy a permitir que me roben la elección”, alega Claudia Delgadillo .\nLee más | Jorge Álvarez Máynez pide a Morena reconocer el triunfo de Movimiento Ciudadano en Jalisco\nLa candidata muestra los datos públicos sobre votos para la gubernatura y la presidencia. De acuerdo al Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) en Jalisco votaron 3.6 millones de personas para la presidencia de México, pero según el IEPC solo votaron 2.4 millones de jaliscienses para definir a su próximo gobernador.\nFoto: Captura de video.\n¿Qué dice el candidato de Movimiento Ciudadano sobre el resultado de elección en Jalisco? Al respecto, Pablo Lemus respondió que Morena difunde información falsa y aseguró que los votos que “dice que faltan” son los que apenas van a contar los consejos distritales, pero que no quieren que sean contabilizadas y por eso recurren a violencia e intimidaciones, “porque saben que en esas casillas les ponemos un baile y ampliamos aún más nuestra ventaja”.\n“No faltan un millón de votos, falta que Morena le permita a los ciudadanos y al IEPC terminar de contarlos. De forma tramposa, la candidata de Morena en su “cálculo” omitió más del 36% de las actas en Jalisco que aún no estaban contabilizadas en el último corte del PREP del Instituto Electoral”, dijo Lemus.\nLos simpatizantes y representantes de Morena y de los partidos aliados — Partido Verde, partido del Trabajo, Futuro y Hagamos — permanecían fuera de las instalaciones electorales del distrito 10 desde las 8 de la mañana, porque el partido sostiene que es el principal distrito donde hay una amplia inconsistencia en el número de votos emitidos para el cargo de gobernador y presidencia.\n“En este distrito tenemos votos para gobernador de alrededor de 85 mil votos, sin embargo en este mismo distrito, en el 10, de Zapopan, que es el mismo territorio y que se votaron al mismo tiempo en las casillas únicas hay 233 mil votos para la presidencia. Es una diferencia de 146 mil votos”, explicó Mario Delgado, dirigente Nacional de Morena.\nEn el siguiente distrito donde denunciaron que también hay una amplia diferencia en la votación es el distrito 1, ubicado en el municipio de Tequila. La inconsistencia señalada es por 70 mil votos. Se trata de la sede donde este mismo miércoles se reportó la asistencia de personas que portaban armas, presuntamente de Morena.\n“Este hecho intimidatorio no es compatible con un proceso legal, pacífico y transparente como el que estamos llevando a cabo”, insistió el instituto electoral a través de un comunicado.\nAdemás de los altercados antes mencionados, el resto de juntas distritales en Jalisco también tuvieron movilizaciones y manifestaciones de simpatizantes y representantes morenistas, aunque no se reportaron mayores incidentes en dichas sedes.\nRepresentante de Morena en en el Consejo del Distrito 10.

    "text": "An official from the IDF Southern Command has accused the military of covering up the truth about its response to the Hamas attack on October 7. Testifying anonymously before an independent civilian commission, the official alleged that internal investigations conducted by the IDF were riddled with conflicts of interest and failed to reveal the true events.\nThe official claimed that almost every investigation led by IDF ground forces was far from accurate, saying, “They are motivated by a strategy of protecting each other.” He raised concerns about a colonel tasked with leading a probe, who was set for promotion by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, questioning how such an officer could conduct an impartial investigation. The official referred to this as a “clear conflict of interest.”\nAdditionally, the official revealed that when they questioned why they hadn’t been included in another investigation, they were told that it was to “protect the general.” They further expressed that families of the surveillance soldiers, many of whom died or were involved in monitoring the Gaza border before the attack, were not being told the full truth.\nTestimonies from former surveillance soldiers and the families of those killed have previously revealed issues with technical malfunctions in monitoring equipment and inadequate training on how to respond if their bases were breached. These families have been demanding a thorough investigation into the IDF’s handling of their children’s warnings before the October 7 attack.\n( YWN World Headquarters – NYC )",

    "text": "Solar storm brings northern lights to western Massachusetts SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - Beautiful colors lit up our sky Thursday night, which led to stunning sights and photos all across New England, including in western Massachusetts. That was thanks to the aurora borealis, otherwise known as the northern lights. The skies were filled with green, pink, and magenta as the northern lights became visible in western Massachusetts. It’s something we don’t usually get to see too often and that was thanks to a strong geomagnetic storm. You may be wondering: what are the northern lights and why were we able to see them in western Massachusetts when, normally, that’s not the case? The earth has a magnetic field and the sun emits a solar wind with charged protons and electrons that come towards the earth. They travel right along the earth’s magnetic field and go right to the poles where the magnetic field is at its weakest. Those charged protons and electrons will interact with molecules in our atmosphere to create those beautiful lights and, when the geomagnetic storm is strong enough, that’s when we can see those northern lights going a little bit further south more than normal. You can see anything from those beautiful greens to some blues and reds. To view them, you want to go out into a big open sky, away from city lights, where you’re away from that light pollution and it’s also best to look at it through a long exposure camera.

    "title": "Le deuxième sommet sur le pouvoir d'achat a fait un flop",
    "text": "La première édition de ce \"sommet sur le pouvoir d'achat\" avait été organisée en grande pompe et très médiatisée. La deuxième, en revanche, ne semble pas avoir réussi à mettre tout le monde d'accord. Une conférence de presse avait été annoncée pour la mi-journée, juste à la fin de l'événement pour en dresser le bilan, mais elle a été annulée sans explication. Le sommet n'a pas non plus donné lieu à une déclaration commune. Or, l'an dernier, il avait accouché d'un document regroupant des objectifs pour lesquels tous les participants s'engageaient à se battre. Milieux économiques invités L'an dernier, Monsieur Prix avait envoyé un carton d'invitation aux organisations de défense des consommateurs. Cette année, il a allongé la liste des participants en incluant les milieux économiques, avec Economiesuisse, l'Union suisse des arts et métiers ou encore la Fédération des entreprises romandes. L'objectif était de connaître aussi le point de vue de ceux qui fixent les prix. Mais les grandes organisations représentant les consommateurs et ces nouveaux arrivants ne se sont pas mis d'accord sur grand-chose. Pas d'entente La RTS s'est procurée le document contenant les mesures préconisées par tous les acteurs. Il apparaît que les organisations économiques ont utilisé ce rendez-vous pour marteler leurs revendications habituelles: pas d'augmentation des cotisations salaires, étendre les accords de libre-échange, libéraliser le marché de l'électricité, alléger les réglementations qui touchent la construction de nouveaux logements ou encore éliminer les obstacles au commerce. Ces revendications n'ont pas été au goût, notamment, de la Fédération romande des consommateurs. A l'inverse, les remèdes de la FRC, comme le gel des primes maladie, n'ont pas convaincu l'économie. A noter aussi que la pression de l'opinion publique sur ce sujet s'est relâchée, entre autres parce que l'inflation est maintenant considérée comme maîtrisée en Suisse, même si les bas revenus continuent à en souffrir. Pas un échec pour Monsieur Prix et son équipe Invité à commenter le sommet, \"Monsieur Prix\" Stefan Meierhans n'a pas retourné les appels de la RTS. Aux yeux de son suppléant Beat Niederhauser, toutefois, ce sommet n'est pas du tout un échec. Pour lui, au contraire, il existe maintenant, après des échanges intenses, une base de discussion précieuse. \"Chaque participant a compris les soucis de l'autre\", affirme-t-il, et il faut maintenant du temps pour digérer tout ça. Il a dit espérer une suite à ce deuxième sommet. Cléa Favre / juma",
