Adi Shankaracharya taught pure Vedic wisdom that allows to achieve material and spiritual success. He was a traditionalist who did not dilute or misinterpret systems but was proud of his origin as a Devta Upasaka. On this development, Anuradha ji said, \"Sanatan Dharma, is often misinterpreted. In reality, it encompasses a timeless and universal philosophy that promotes individual strength, harmony and an inclusive ecosystem. Its teachings emphasize the importance of inner peace, spiritual growth and the interconnectedness of all beings. By promoting these values, it seeks to create a world where diverse cultures can unite under a common platform of mutual respect and understanding. I am committed to taking this message of peace and unity to audiences around the world\".
