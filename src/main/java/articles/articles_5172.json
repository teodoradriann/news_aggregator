    "title": "Colorado Red Lobster restaurant finds rare orange lobster in shipment, takes it to Denver aquarium",
    "text": "By Amy Beth Hanson ,\n39 minutes ago\nThe Downtown Aquarium in Denver has a new resident — a rare orange lobster that was rescued from a shipment of crustaceans delivered to a Red Lobster restaurant in Pueblo, Colorado .\nA long-term employee who is a dishwasher and head biscuit maker spotted the bright orange lobster while unpacking a shipment last Friday and alerted restaurant managers, aquarium officials said. The staff named it Crush after the Denver Broncos ' legendary Orange Crush defense from 1976 to 1986.\n“Myself and many of my team are born and raised Denver Broncos fans, so as soon as we saw that orange color, we knew that Crush would be an excellent representation,” said Kendra Kastendieck, the restaurant's general manager. “And we all want our defensive line to be that good again.\"\nWhen the Pueblo Zoo couldn't take Crush, Kastendieck called the Downtown Aquarium, which she said was interested right away.\nKastendieck packed Crush with ice packs in a plastic foam container and delivered it to the aquarium on Wednesday.\n“As soon as they acclimated him to his quarantine tank at the Denver aquarium, he was very active right off the bat and was really exploring his little area,” Kastendieck said Thursday.\nStaff had set up a tank with a new generation Denver Broncos helmet on top and an older generation one sitting in the tank “so he can actually climb into it and play around it,” she said.\nCrush will be examined by a veterinarian and after 30 days in quarantine will be placed in the “Lurks” exhibit that houses other cold water North Atlantic Ocean species, aquarium staff said.\n“We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado,” Ryan Herman, general curator at Denver Downtown Aquarium, said in a statement.\nCrush was shipped to the Pueblo restaurant from a supplier in Tennessee . It was caught off a coast of Canada, said Kastendieck, but she was unable to confirm which coast.\nGenetic mutations can lead to lobsters that are orange, blue and yellow. Downtown Aquarium has had one orange lobster previously.\nThe Downtown Aquarium has more than 700 species of fish along with a stingray reef and three Sumatran tigers.\n___\nHanson reported from Helena, Montana.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Zedlitz, MDis a board-certified dermatologist based in Baton Rouge, LA Jody Levine, MDis a board-certified dermatologist based in New York Orit Markowitz, MDis board-certified dermatologist based in New York Elaine Kung, MDis a board certified dermatologist based in New York\n- Jonathon Cook, MD is a board-certified dermatologist based in Boca Raton, FL\n- Joel Cohen, MD is board-certified dermatologist in Denver\nWhat Lasers Can Do\nThey can reduce the look of\nwrinkles and scars, even out pigmentation, eliminate age spots, minimally tighten skin, and remove cancerous and malignant lesions. These treatments also tighten and firm the skin, minimize pores, and fade pigmentation and sun damage by breaking down excess pigment and damaged cells. Additionally, laser procedures are non-invasive, safe outpatient procedures with minimal downtime and risks when conducted by experienced practitioner, making them a popular choice for rejuvenating the skin.\nDeep Lines + Wrinkles\nAccording to New York dermatologist Jody Levine, MD, lasers work better on static lines and wrinkles, not dynamic ones. Static lines are there even when you’re not making an expression. Resurfacing lasers can help smooth etched-in lines by creating collagen and elastin synthesis for weeks afterward. “I’ll use a full-field erbium laser like the Sciton Joule for the mouth and eyes, and treat the rest of the face with the CO2RE fractional CO2 laser or ProFractional erbium laser,” says Denver dermatologist Joel Cohen, MD. “These focus microscopic beams of light to target water in the skin and\nremove surface damage. Downtime can last a week or more, depending on the treatment; however, results can be dramatic.”\nDID YOU KNOW?\nLasers are categorized into two groups: ablative and nonablative. Ablative treatments “vaporize” the top layer of skin, while nonablative ones heat up underlying tissue without harming the surface to produce new collagen.\nTone + Texture\nOf the variety of imperfections that we accumulate as we age, Boca Raton, FL plastic surgeon Jonathon Cook, MD says tone and texture changes are the easiest to improve. Think mild wrinkles,\nvisible pores, skin roughness and light acne scars. “Uneven texture is one of the most subtle things to explain to a patient, but when you see smoother skin after a laser, it’s often because you really reset that surface texture. This brings out a ‘lit from within’ glow that happens when light bounces off the skin.” For first-time laser patients, Dr. Cook says gentle resurfacing with treatments like MOXI and Clear + Brilliant are good ways to dip their toe in the laser pond. Multiple sessions may be needed to see the full results.\nFor more aggressive polishing, Dr. Cook says fullfield resurfacing with an erbium laser is best. “For deep acne scars, I recommend combining ablative and nonablative energy with the\nBBL Halo or Fraxel DUAL hybrid lasers,” he adds. “A hybrid laser is a good option because it allows the practitioner to combine various wavelengths in one treatment for a more customized approach.”\nPigment Erasers\nTo\nreduce melasma, hyperpigmentation or age spots, these treatments go “low and slow,” as too much heat can generate additional melanin. ”Lasers work great for pigment, but you have to know what you’re doing or you can make dark spots worse. This is why it’s imperative to see a board-certified dermatologist who specializes in lasers,” Dr. Levine says. “The combination of a BBL photofacial with the PicoSure laser has made the biggest impact for my patients. PicoSure helps lift deeper pigment and BBL takes care of more superficial pigment. The two complement each other.”\nFor dark spots, the photoacoustic PicoWay laser is a favorite of New York dermatologist Orit Markowitz, MD. “It works from the inside out on most all skin types. It helps absorb the pigment through sound waves rather than a heating effect,” she says. “It’s painless, there’s no downtime and it minimizes the risk of overheating surrounding tissue.”\nMany times laser modalities are combined or “stacked” to achieve the best results. “I often use multiple devices during one treatment because most people aren’t dealing with just one aesthetic concern,” says New York dermatologist Elaine Kung, MD, who likes the SmoothGlo as a starting point for treating darker skin tones. “It isn’t a laser per se, but it helps treat skin laxity and discoloration. I combine the synergistic energies of SmoothGlo’s Stellar M22 Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) with TriLift radiofrequency (RF) microneedling.” The IPL uses multiple wavelengths of light to target discoloration; the microneedling addresses texture. “Typically, patients need three sessions performed once a month,” Dr. Kung adds. “This tends to yield the best result for treating people with medium-to-darker skin tones.”\nBecause they stimulate more collagen, these treatments can provide the most natural-looking results over time, not overnight.Dr. Kung\nRedness + Rosacea\nRosacea can make the blood vessels on the face more visible, and both lasers and IPL can be used to treat the accompanying redness. Both modalities can target the hemoglobin in the blood vessels to heat them up and destroy them, however lasers are more precise. “The gold standard for eliminating vascular lesions, which can lead to pink and red spots and patches on the skin, is the Vbeam laser,” Dr. Levine explains. “After a series of these treatments, patients experience a marked decrease in redness and their skin looks like it did when they were several years younger.”\nNew “Lunchtime Laser” Options\nDr. Cohen says the new “3-D Miracle” option on the UltraClear laser is the first treatment he’d consider a true “lunchtime laser.” In the past, referring to a laser treatment as something you could do easily on a lunch break was a stretch. “You don’t need anesthesia, and for weekend downtime, the lowest mode can be employed. If you need more improvement, we recommend a series of sessions spaced four to six weeks apart,” he explains. Other treatments with minimal discomfort and less downtime, like CoolPeel and Tixel, can also be done in a shorter timeframe.\nAt-Home Laser Therapy\nThe term “cold laser therapy” was born in the alternative medicine world as a pain-management approach on the body. Low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT) employs a noninvasive form of phototherapy that uses light wavelengths in the visible to near-infrared range. The FDA-cleared LYMA Laser device uses this same cold, near infrared technology, says founder Lucy Goff. “It’s a first for at-home beauty devices, and 100 times more powerful than LED. The technology has been used for decades to treat medical issues as diverse as rebuilding cartilage and healing tendons.” According to Goff, it’s safe for all skin tones and helps instruct skin cells to fight free radicals and boost collagen, leading to suppler, smoother skin. Celebrity aesthetician Joanna Czech calls it a game changer: “It’s incredibly powerful, portable and most importantly, safe.”\nSkin Cancer Removal\nNot just for cosmetic purposes, lasers can also be an effective treatment for small cancerous lesions. Utilizing advanced imaging with Optical Coherence Tomography, which uses infrared and broadband light, Dr. Markowitz can see below skin at the depth to diagnose skin cancer. “I can then treat the spot with nonablative lasers to remove the cancer without surgery,” she says. For most patients, one treatment does the trick she says, but for those with larger or deeper skin cancers, she may treat them two or three times.\nWhat to Use After Your Laser Treatments\nThese essentials will help skin heal, renew and rejuvenate faster\nafter a laser treatment.

    "text": "Zero, often seen as a simple circle, holds an extraordinary place in the annals of mathematics and human history. The question of who invented zero leads us into a fascinating exploration across ancient civilizations, each contributing uniquely to its development. From the early absence of zero in Roman numerals to its conceptual birth in India and independent emergence in the Mayan civilization, the story of zero is a journey of intellectual evolution, cultural exchange, and profound impact on modern science and technology.\nTable of Contents\nWho Invented Zero?\nThe invention of zero can be credited to\nancient Indian mathematicians, particularly to those of the 5th century. While the concept of zero, or a placeholder for nothing, had been in use in several ancient civilizations for counting and positional notation, it was in India that zero was first conceptualized as a number with its own unique value and properties.\nEarly Numerical Systems Without Zero\nIn the absence of a zero digit, early numerical systems, including those of ancient civilizations, faced limitations in representing large numbers and performing complex operations like multiplying and dividing numbers.\nThe Roman numeral system is a prime example, lacking a symbol for zero, which hindered mathematical progress in various fields.\nREAD MORE:\nWho Invented Math? The History of Mathematics\nThe Origin and History of Zero in India\nThe journey of zero in ancient India, a landmark in the annals of mathematics, is intertwined with the evolution of the concept of zero from a philosophical notion to a practical numeral. Indian mathematicians, delving into the realms of negative and positive numbers, recognized the necessity of a symbol that could represent an absence, an empty space, or ‘nothingness’ in their calculations. This recognition led to the birth of the mathematical zero digit, a concept that was both revolutionary and foundational for the development of modern mathematics.\nAncient Indian scrolls and texts, such as the “Bakhshali Manuscript,” dating back to as early as the third or fourth century AD, bear witness to this evolution. The manuscript, considered by many scholars as the oldest recorded example of the zero digit, features a dot symbol (which later evolved into the small circle we recognize as zero) used in a numerical context. This symbol signified more than just an empty column in counting; it represented a new, distinct quantity – a leap forward in the number system.\nThe real breakthrough, however, came with the works of Brahmagupta, a renowned Hindu astronomer and mathematician of the 7th century AD. Brahmagupta’s treatise “Brahmasphutasiddhanta” is a pivotal text in Indian mathematics, as it marks the first instance where zero is explicitly defined as a number in its own right. His work laid down rules for arithmetic operations involving zero, such as addition, subtraction, and even multiplication. This was a monumental step, as it transitioned zero from a mere placeholder to an integral part of arithmetic operations.\nThe philosophical and cultural factors in ancient India played a significant role in this development. The concept of ‘śūnya,’ or void in Sanskrit, permeated Indian philosophy and contemplations about the universe. This cultural backdrop facilitated the conceptual leap necessary to see zero not just as an absence but as a finite quantity, a concept that would have been considered a dangerous idea in other civilizations of the time.\nBrahmagupta’s advancements in the field of Indian mathematics were not isolated developments. They were part of a broader tradition of mathematical inquiry that included other luminaries such as Aryabhata and Varahamihira. Their collective works contributed to a rich mathematical heritage that not only influenced contemporaneous philosophy but also paved the way for future generations of mathematicians and scientists.\nThe origin and history of zero in ancient India are a testament to the region’s intellectual prowess and its profound impact on the global understanding of mathematics. The journey of zero, from a philosophical abstraction on an ancient Indian scroll to a defined mathematical quantity by Brahmagupta, underscores the integral role of cultural and intellectual contexts in shaping scientific breakthroughs. This development in Indian mathematics laid the groundwork for modern arithmetic, calculus, and even the binary code used in most modern computers, underlining zero’s enduring legacy in shaping the world as we know it today.\nZero in the Americas\nParallel to developments in India, the concept of zero also emerged independently in the Americas, most notably within the Mayan civilization. The Mayans, around the 4th century AD, used zero in their elaborate calendar systems and astronomical calculations. Unlike the Indian zero, which was part of a decimal system, the Mayan zero was part of a vigesimal (base-20) system. This independent invention of zero by the Mayans illustrates the universal need and logical evolution of this mathematical concept in different cultures.\nThe Modern Zero Introduced in the Middle East\nDuring the\nIslamic Golden Age, a period marked by significant advancements in science and culture, the concept of zero was introduced to the Middle East. This introduction was a direct result of the translation and study of Indian mathematical texts, which brought sophisticated mathematical concepts from the Indian subcontinent to the Islamic world. This era, spanning from the 8th to the 14th century, saw Islamic scholars and mathematicians not only assimilate knowledge from different cultures but also expand upon it.\nA key figure in this process was the Persian mathematician\nAl-Khwarizmi, whose work in the 9th century played a pivotal role in the adoption and dissemination of the concept of zero. His famous text, “Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala” (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), is considered one of the foundational texts in algebra. In this work, Al-Khwarizmi systematically integrated the Indian numeral system, including the concept of zero, into Islamic mathematics. His work represented a significant advancement in numerical notation and calculation techniques.\nThe translation of these mathematical concepts into Arabic facilitated their spread throughout the Islamic world and later into Europe. The Arabic numeral system, which included the concept of zero, was far more efficient than the Roman numeral system used in Europe at the time, particularly for complex calculations. Islamic mathematicians’ work with zero enabled advancements in various fields of mathematics, including\nalgebra, arithmetic, and trigonometry.\nMoreover, the introduction of zero had practical implications beyond pure mathematics. It found applications in fields like astronomy, where it was used for more accurate calculations and predictions. It also played a role in the development of accounting and bookkeeping methods, improving the efficiency and accuracy of financial transactions.\nImpact on Europe and the Western World\nZero’s journey to Europe was met with resistance and skepticism. Initially viewed with mistrust due to its association with foreign cultures and its challenging philosophical implications, zero eventually gained acceptance. The work of mathematicians like\nFibonacci, who introduced Arabic numerals and zero through his book “Liber Abaci,” was pivotal. By the 17th century, zero had become an integral part of European mathematics, paving the way for scientific and technological advances during the Renaissance and beyond.\nWhere Did Zero Get Its Name From?\nThe word “zero” has a fascinating linguistic journey. Derived from the Arabic word “sifr,” which means empty or nothing, it was later translated into Latin as “zephirum.” This term evolved into the Italian “zero,” which then made its way into the English language. The naming of zero reflects not only its mathematical function but also its philosophical and cultural interpretations across different societies, symbolizing concepts of void, nothingness, and the infinite.\nThe Final Count: Zero’s Role in Shaping Modern Thought\nZero’s evolution from a mere placeholder in ancient counting systems to a fundamental element of modern mathematics is a testament to human ingenuity. Its historical journey across different civilizations highlights the interconnectedness of human knowledge and the cross-cultural development of ideas. Zero is not just a number; it represents the concept of nothingness, a crucial element in the understanding of our universe and the advancement of technology.",
