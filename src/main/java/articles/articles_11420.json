    "text": "VW kehrt Elektroauto-Namenskonzept den Rücken: ID-Modelle ohne Zukunft\nVolkswagen verzückt die Belegschaft mit einem Strategiewechsel bei den Elektroautos. Die Maßnahme könnte E-Mobilität in Deutschland einen weiteren Schub geben.\nWolfsburg/München – Im Automobilbereich ist ein Name mehr als nur ein Etikett – er ist auch ein Stück Geschichte. Volkswagen setzt demnächst auf die Kraft der Tradition und verabschiedet sich offenbar von der aktuellen Modellbezeichnung für Elektroautos.\nDer Konzern hat einem Bericht zufolge auf einer Betriebsversammlung im Stammwerk Wolfsburg eine bedeutende Änderung angekündigt: E-Autos der nächsten Generation werden künftig nicht mehr nach dem bisherigen Muster benannt.\nVW mit neuer E-Auto-Strategie: Modellnamen mit traditionellen Wurzeln\nVW-Markenchef Thomas Schäfer erklärte laut der Wolfsburger Allgemeinen, dass „ikonische Namen“ nicht sterben dürfen und der ID-Name für neue Modelle ausläuft.\nDie Entscheidung würde das Ende einer Ära markieren, die unter dem früheren Vorstandschef Herbert Diess (bis 2022 im Amt) begann. Damals wurde mit dem ID.3 das Pendant zum klassischen Golf als erstes Modell einer eigenen Elektro-Familie vorgestellt.\nDie ID-Buchstaben standen laut einer 2019 veröffentlichten Pressemitteilung für „intelligentes Design“ und „Identität“ – und sollten die neuen Stromer mit visionären Technologien klar von den Verbrennermodellen abgrenzen. Dass sich diesbezüglich eine Änderung anbahnt, berichtete Ippen.Media vor einigen Monaten.\nVolkswagen ändert E-Auto-Namen: Was bedeutet das für aktuelle Modelle?\nDass bereits die bestehenden Modellnamen der elektrischen Fahrzeuge aus Wolfsburg angepasst werden, wäre ein ungewöhnlicher Schritt. Eine entsprechende Anfrage der Autobild dazu blieb von Volkswagen unbeantwortet.\nVor wenigen Jahren läutete die ID-Familie bei Volkswagen eine neue Ära ein. Doch weder die Verkaufszahlen noch die Akzeptanz der Modelle konnten gänzlich überzeugen. Die Rückbesinnung auf klassische Namen wie Golf, Polo und Tiguan könnte den Elektroautos von VW einen vertrauteren Anstrich geben – und bei der Belegschaft im Stammwerk sei die Ankündigung gut angekommen, schildert der Bericht.\nVW kehrt bei Modellnamen für Elektroautos zu den Wurzeln zurück\nViele Kundinnen und Kunden identifizieren sich stärker mit den altbekannten Modellnamen: Ein Golf bleibt eben ein Golf – auch wenn er elektrisch fährt und die Bezeichnung ID.3 trägt. Die Rückkehr zu traditionellen Bezeichnungen könnte daher nicht nur das Markenimage stärken, sondern auch die Nachfrage nach Elektroautos ankurbeln. Gleiches gilt für geplante Änderungen beim Design.\nMit dem neuen Elektro-Kleinwagen, der in wenigen Monaten startet, will VW laut der Wolfsburger Allgemeinen bereits auf die neue Namensgebung setzen. Anstatt ID.2 könnte das neue Einstiegsmodell als VW E-Polo oder womöglich ID.Polo an den Start gehen. Derweil erweisen sich in Deutschland produzierte E-Modelle zunehmend als Exportschlager. (PF)",

    "text": "FOR the umpteenth time, Ogun State once again emerged as one of the three leading economically viable states in Nigeria. For three consecutive sessions under the administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun, the state has routinely maintained its competitive edge over the rest parts of the country. This time around, as a testament to its growing economic potential, the latest report conducted by Economic Confidential, measuring the Internally Revenue Generating (IGR) capacity of each state as a percentage of Federal allocation, put Ogun State on the front roll. While states like Bayelsa, Katsina, Jigawa, Niger, Adamawa, Yobe, and Taraba remained on the fringes and largely insolvent, Lagos, Ogun, and Rives states maintained their leading position among those that could conveniently survive without any federal allocation. Putting the state on the pedestal of sustainable growth within a term of four years is no mean feat. As a comparative analysis of the annual State Viability Index indicates, those categorised as insolvent generally have an IGR of less than 10 percent of their total receipts of federal allocation. Based on this standard, only six states have the economic potential to stay afloat under zero allocation from the Federal Government. And Ogun State stands tall among its peer group, closely trailing Lagos.\nAccording to the report, Ogun State is next to Lagos as Nigeria’s top investment destination. By comparative analysis, the Abiodun-led administration outshone Rivers State on the list of economically viable states for the year 2022 alongside Kaduna, Kwara, Oyo, and Edo states. The breakdown of the figures compiled from the release by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) showed that Lagos received the sum of N370, 921, 413, 425.62 from the Federation Account and generated N651,145, 633.085 as internally generated revenue, while Ogun received N113,404, 027,439.22 from the Federation Account and generated N120,548, 157,140.78 internally. On the other hand, Rivers State received N363.4bn from the Federation Account and generated N172bn; Kaduna received N155bn and generated N58bn; Kwara received N99bn and generated N35.7bn; Oyo received N181bn and generated N62bn, while Edo received N147bn in federal allocation and generated N47.4bn.\nThis revelation was made during the presentation of the 2022 Annual States Viability Index Report in Abuja recently. In summary, the figures showed that the total Internally Generated Revenue of N1.5trn from the seven most viable states in 2022 was almost twice the total IGR of 29 states put together merely generating about N650bn. On the flipside, six states, including Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, and Katsina states, failed to generate up to 10 percent of the total allocations received from the Federal Government for 2022 and were therefore declared insolvent. Interestingly, oil-rich Bayelsa state is at the bottom of the list with N273bn federal allocation and N15.9bn IGR, representing 5.81% of the allocations. On the other hand, Kebbi State received N119bn FAAC allocation and generated N9bn IGR, representing 7.67 percent, while Katsina which got N165bn FAAC allocation, recorded N13bn IGR, representing 7.90 percent. Similarly, Akwa Ibom which received N360bn, generated N34.8bn, representing 9.66 percent, while its Taraba state counterpart earned N103 billion FAAC and generated N10.2 billion, translating to 9.91 percent. Yobe received N105bn and generated N10.4bn, accounting for 9.91 percent.\nThere is a wide range of implications for these poorly performing states. One, they will only depend on federal allocation to survive because of their comparatively low capacity for internally generated revenue (IGR). Secondly, they will have comparatively less revenue left to implement the capital expenditure components of their budgets, thus facing a greater risk of resorting to more borrowing or under-implementing their capital budgets. Worse than that, they offer no attraction for investment that could lead to economic growth. Ogun State is a nautical mile away from this scenario. Ranked higher on the performance index, it has comparatively limited dependence on federally distributed revenue for its operations and thus has greater viability if it were to theoretically exist as an independent entity.\nThis achievement is a testament to the positive result of the I-S-E-Y-A mantra of the administration. As an initiative invented to stimulate collective action for greater efficiency and productivity, the administration has never looked back on its drive for sustainable economic growth and prosperity for all since Abiodun assumed the mantle of leadership in 2019. Whatever the state has been able to achieve in terms of infrastructure development, healthcare delivery, education and human capital development, transportation, housing, youth empowerment, and agriculture, among others, is a result of collective ownership of the process, which is encapsulated in the acronym I-S-E-Y-A. It, therefore, goes without saying that the initiative has contributed significantly to poverty reduction and widespread prosperity throughout Ogun State.\nRight from the inception of his administration, Governor Abiodun has routinely maintained his mission statement, focusing on “qualitative governance and to create the enabling environment for a public-private sector partnership, which is fundamental to the creation of an enduring economic development and individual prosperity of the people”. So, by sustaining the trajectory of growth, certainly, the best is yet to come for the state. It can only get better with continued commitment, focused leadership, and support of the citizenry.\nOver the years, relevant stakeholders have always expressed concern over states’ heavy dependence on federal revenue for the implementation of yearly budgets. This is borne out of the need for enhanced public revenue generation to implement capital expenditure components of their budgets after fulfilling obligations to workers and other operating expenses. However, due to a lack of creative ideas, fiscal transparency, and accountability in public finance, most states have remained indifferent to the call.\nContrarily, Governor Abiodun has included an aggressive revenue drive as part of the cardinal agenda of his administration since its inception. And that is what has accounted for the less dependence of the state on revenue allocation from the Federal Government.\nIt is also the reason for the success the administration has recorded in the area of infrastructure development which makes the state a leading investment destination not only in Nigeria but West African sub-region.\nWith an assurance of an enabling environment, Governor Abiodun has continued to extend his calls on foreign businesses to make the state, especially the Special Economic Processing Zone, the destination of choice while considering investing in Nigeria.\nWhile speaking as a guest on CNBC Africa recently on the sidelines of the Intra-African Trade Fair, put together by Afreximbank, in Cairo, Egypt, he said Ogun State had put everything in place to host any business venture.\nHe said Ogun State had the required infrastructure, including accessibility, access to power, and a youthful and educated population to make it investor-friendly.\nHis words: “We like to refer to ourselves as the Gateway State. We are the gateway to Nigeria’s prosperity. We are the industrial capital of Nigeria. By all accounts, we have well over 5,000 industries. We are the number one in non-oil revenue in Nigeria because we have large mineral deposits, particularly limestone.\n“That explains why we have Lafarge, Dangote, and many other cement factories. The biggest cement factory in Nigeria is in Ogun State.\n“Now, why are we here (Cairo)? We are here to attract more investors to our state, particularly as we pride ourselves on having the required infrastructure, be it road, rail, or air. We have a new airport, unarguably one of the best airports in Nigeria.\n“Our Airport is situated in our Special Economic Processing Zone. The zone is being supported by Afreximbank and being operated and constructed by a private sector player called Arise LLP.\n“Today, we want people to know about the zone, to come and establish processing concerns and factories in that zone, referencing the 5,000 other industrial activities that exist in Ogun State.”\nThe governor listed some of the companies in the state including Lafarge, Nestle, Cadbury, May&Baker, Unilever, and Olam flours, among others. He noted that companies coming to invest in the state would take advantage of its vast agro-produce like rubber, cassava, which Ogun is the number one producer in the world, palm oil, cashew, cocoa, cotton, eggs, and poultry.\n“We are trying to attract investors to this processing zone, more so because we have gas, which allows them to access power. So, you are sure that your major cost of production, which could be power in most instances, is already mitigated.\n“And I believe that we’ve managed to convince a lot of our listeners that Ogun State, the industrial capital of Nigeria, the education capital of Nigeria with reserve of youthful population is ready to receive you and as a government, we’ve provided a lot of reforms and policy initiatives to further increase our rating on the ease of doing business index,” he added.\nThe Governor also spoke on the significance of the African Quality Assurance Centre (AQAC), which has been established at the Special Economic Processing Zone, a development which he said, would make Nigeria get value for her agro-produce.\nBut with AQAC in Ogun State, and within the agro-processing zone, Prince Abiodun said agro-produce from Nigeria can now be certified fit-for-purpose in line with world best practices. “And now, what they\ndo in AQAC is, they don’t wait until you have grown or you have harvested. They intervene from the point of your inputs, from the point of how you have planted, from what type of fertilisers you have used, from what type of fertilisers you were meant to use to ensure that by the time they are stamping your agro-produce, it is certified fit-for-purpose.\n“Hitherto, when goods will have to go to Ghana or any other country to be exported, it means that agro-produce would probably have been undervalued. So, from now on, Nigeria can now export its agro-produce at the right value because it’s stamped fit-for-purpose from Nigeria,” he enthused.\nBy the time all of these propositions come to fruition, Ogun State will be the envy of all. And they will because the foundation for the necessary infrastructure that would serve as a pull factor has already been put in place.\nThis is part of the reason Prince Abiodun emerged as Vanguard’s Governor of the Year 2021 Award for creating enduring economic development and individual prosperity in Ogun State. As attested to by the organisers of the event, he emerged winner of the award through a rigorous selection process. Since then, he’s been doing his best not to let the guard down.\n- Ogbonnikan writes in from Abeokuta, Ogun State.\nYOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM\n NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Primate Ayodele releases 91-page prophecy for 2024\nThe leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has released his prophecies for 2024 as it is…\nNIMC issues new guidelines for date of birth modification\nThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued new guidelines for the modification of…\nSen Natasha spreads Christmas cheer with generous palliatives in Kogi Central\nIn commemoration of Christmas and New Year celebrations, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan (Kogi Central), has put smiles on…\nFive Nigerian musicians who had the biggest hit songs in 2023\nNigeria’s music industry had a remarkable year, with talented singers and hit songs making…\nHistory will judge me, I gave Nigeria my best as ‘president,’ IBB declares\nFormer military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) has said history will judge him as leader of the country for…\nAnthony Joshua beats Otto Wallin in five rounds\nAnthony Joshua delivered one of his best displays in recent memory with an impressive stoppage of Otto Wallin in…",

    "text": "香港新修訂的《保護海港條例》在社會強烈反對聲音下，周三（7日）獲立法會三讀通過。本台翻查資料，這條例在1997年通過，目的是要守護港人的特別公有資產，並在「三權分立」的制度下，以司法權制衡行政機關濫用填海權力，過去曾成功迫使港府撤回或修改多項具爭議的填海計劃，包括2003年中環填海工程。然而，新修例被質疑變相把填海的決定權交予行政機關，由「港府自己批自己」，將來「維港變維河」的惡夢有可能成真。\n《2024年保護海港（修訂）條例草案》周三（7日）在「愛國者」壟斷的立法會「三讀」中，以大比數通過，標誌條例自1997年實施以來首次重大改變，料今年內實施。\n新修例主要為港府填海工程「拆牆鬆綁」，不再「一刀切」限制所有填海發展，為「小規模工程」新設「行政豁免機制」。條例實質上將推翻「不准填海推定」，以及依據「三層測試」門檻（即證明凌駕性公眾需要、無可行替代、最少破壞）來裁決可否填海的權利，由法院轉移至行政長官及行政會議手上。\n同時，修例亦引入「技術評估」機制，允許由政府內部自行決定工程對維港的環境影響，無須再經法庭驗證或第三方審查。雖條例形式上仍保留市民司法覆核的權利，但在實務上，此種覆核只能針對政府決定的程序或法律錯誤提出挑戰，對工程內容本身的實質監察有限。\n「清一色」議員埋怨舊法例阻礙海港發展\n在會上，民建聯立法會議員李慧琼和顏汶羽等大批建制派議員，認同政府的看法並投贊成票，指以往保護海港限制和填海門檻「過高」，阻礙海港發展；而新機制「避免在行政程序上過度司法化」。但表明投棄權票的新思維立法會議狄志遠，就質疑修例有違立法制衡的原意，剝削司法權。\n發展局局長甯漢豪回應指，修例後填海工程仍須經過「嚴謹」的法定程序，「體現政府對保護維港的承擔」，又否認事前沒有做到充分公眾諮詢，自2023年提出方案時已「廣泛諮詢」各界意見。\n翻查資料，《保護海港條例》（下稱《條例》）被視為香港具代表的民主體現。自90年代起，港英政府有意在維港大規模填海，引起大批港人和環保人士反對，「保護海港協會」因而成立。當時身兼協會副主席的民主派香港立法局議員陸恭蕙，以私人草案形式提出《條例》，並於香港主權移交前夕獲立法局以大比數通過，表明「海港須作為香港人的特別公有資產和天然財產而受到保護和保存」，而設立「不准填海的推定」。其原先設計強調體現「三權分立」與制衡原則，以法院作為守門人，透過司法權限制行政機關濫用填海權力。\n港府曾多次挑戰《保護海港條例》均被法庭阻止\n《條例》自1997年香港主權移交後實施，多次阻止港府過度填海。最具代表性的是，2003至2004年，保護海港協會成功挑戰香港政府，在終審法院推翻「灣仔北填海計劃」，法院作出宣判時指出時確立條例的法律地位，訂立填海需要符合「三大原則」，並成為日後填海法定標準。\n「保護海港協會」副主席徐嘉慎多次公開批評，歷年來政府都想推行大規模填海，若按政府原本的計劃，中環要填海多38公頃，現時已經填去18公頃，原本要將海岸線延伸多幾百呎；全面填平紅磡至舊機場跑道尾的範圍；灣仔、青洲亦會填海，但是上述均被法庭阻止「維港變維河」。\n他又指，修例的效果是「政府提出填海申請，自己做返法官」，之後政府又成為地皮的業主，有利益衝突，不符合普通法」，而且亦將打開濫用小工程的漏洞來蠶食維港，質疑為私有化海濱及維港大規模填海造地「鋪路」。\n但協會有關言論，今年1月一律被發展局「嚴正駁斥」是「誤導、不符事實」。如今民間反對聲音已無法阻止修例實施。\n編輯：溫曉平",
