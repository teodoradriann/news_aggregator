    "text": "Este jueves 3 de octubre, la empresa multinacional Veolia lanzó su nueva apuesta para el manejo de residuos en Colombia y Panamá: los Centros Inteligentes de Gestión Ecológica (CIGES), con los cuales buscan articular la tecnología a sus procesos e implementar prácticas más eficientes y sostenibles con el medio ambiente. El lanzamiento se realizó en el Parque Tecnológico Ambiental Antanas de la ciudad de Pasto (Nariño), que ahora será uno de los CIGES de la entidad.

Con los CIGES, la compañía busca contribuir a tres objetivos esenciales: la descarbonización, la descontaminación y la regeneración de recursos, con el fin de darles una vida útil. “Queremos apoyar al país en esa transición organizada hacia la economía circular y ver cómo obteniendo información en línea, caracterizando y haciendo modelos predictivos, podemos aprovechar más cada uno de los tipos de residuos que recibimos en nuestros CIGES”, afirmó. Veolia cuenta con ocho CIGES a nivel nacional para la gestión de residuos ordinarios y otros cuatro para residuos peligrosos. También hay uno en Panamá. Protegiendo la biodiversidad Una de las grandes características de estos CIGES es que están ubicados en zonas de alta biodiversidad donde además de la gestión de residuos se procura la protección de la fauna y la flora local. “A través de los CIGES hacemos una gestión adecuada de la biodiversidad en armonía con la gestión de residuos, algo que antes era impensable. Tenemos más de 400 hectáreas protegidas y estamos recuperando bosques de características únicas en el país que son un tesoro nacional para el cuidado y la protección del medio ambiente”, resaltó Buelvas Pérez. De esta manera, la operación se realiza en los centros cuidando que las especies nativas de plantas y animales sigan desarrollándose en su hábitat natural. Con las comunidades La directora de Veolia resaltó que otro aspecto clave de la operación de la empresa es el trabajo que se realiza con las comunidades para contribuir a la economía circular. Allí destacó el programa ‘Recuperador Amigo’, mediante el cual los recicladores de oficio cooperan con la compañía. “Les damos incentivos como educación, herramientas para aumentar su productividad, garantizar sus condiciones de trabajo y la comercialización de lo que recuperan. Esta es una de las acciones que evidencian nuestro trabajo conjunto con las comunidades donde trabajamos en pro de la economía circular”, destacó Buelvas Pérez. En este sentido, añadió que la educación, la conciencia del consumo y la disposición de residuos es fundamental para avanzar en este propósito. “Nos toca concientizar a nuestros usuarios de que debemos tener un consumo y una disposición consciente, que los residuos lleguen y no mueran sino que reinicien su ciclo productivo”, puntualizó. Ese es uno de los grandes retos que ya empezó a asumir la compañía, que con la implementación de los CIGES espera fortalecer esa labor en todo el país.",

    "title": "How To Ensure A Big, Ugly War With Iran; VDH | ZeroHedge",
    "text": "How To Ensure A Big, Ugly War With Iran; VDH [Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via American Greatness,](https://amgreatness.com/2024/02/01/how-to-ensure-a-big-ugly-war-with-iran/) Iranian-backed militias have attacked American installations and forces in Syria, Iraq, and Jordan some 170 times. Ostensibly, these terrorist groups claim they are hitting US forces to coerce America into dropping its support of Israel and demanding a cease-fire in the Gaza war. In reality, these satellite terrorists are being directed in a larger effort by Iran to pry the US. out of the Middle East, in the manner of the 1983 Marine barracks bombing. That way, Iran will be free to fulfill its old dream of becoming a nuclear shield for a new Shiite/Persian terrorist axis from Tehran to Damascus to Beirut to the West Bank and Gaza—surrounding Israel and intimidating the Gulf regimes and more moderate states like Jordan and Egypt into concessions. These Iranian appendages have made a number of unfortunately correct assumptions about America in general and the Biden administration in particular. One, after the recent serial humiliations of the flight from Afghanistan, the passivity of watching a Chinese spy balloon traverse with impunity the continental United States, the mixed American signals on the eve of the Ukraine war, the troubled Pentagon’s recruitment and leadership lapses, and the destruction of the US southern border, both Iran and its surrogates feel that the United States either cannot or will do much of anything in response to their aggression. They see the U.S. military short thousands of recruits, its leadership politicized, its munition stocks depleted by arms shipments to Ukraine and Israel, and the massive abandonment of weapons in Kabul. Two, they view Joe Biden’s serial appeasement as a force multiplier of these perceptions of American weakness. After entering office, the Biden administration begged for a renewed Iran deal from a preening theocracy. It sought to ensure calm by delisting the Houthis from global terrorist designations and sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas and radical Palestinians to buy good behavior. Biden may have agreed that Iran was the spider in the center of the Middle East Islamic terrorist web, but only thereby to win over it with bribes such as lifting embargoes and sanctions to ensure an Iranian windfall of $90 or more billion in oil sales revenue. Biden greenlighted a bribery payment of $6 billion to Iran to return American hostages, thereby ensuring more will be taken. It loudly distanced itself from the Netanyahu government. The gulf encouraged radicals to believe they could coerce Israel into accepting radical Islamic states on the West Bank and Gaza. Three, after hitting American stations and bases 170 times and seeing little sustained, much less disproportionate, responses, Iran and its satellites now feel they are winning proxy wars with the US. They have all but shut down the Red Sea as an international shipping route—damaging Europe, Egypt, and Israel, which all depend on Red Sea commerce for vital imports and exports. Iran has forced Biden to publicly alienate the Netanyahu government and push a ceasefire down Israel’s throat. And it has helped to spark international pro-Hamas protests throughout Europe and the US that timid and compliant left-wing governments fear could lose them close elections. But most damaging are administration spokesmen who mouth the same empty script after each serial attack: 1) The US will respond at the time and place of its own choosing. 2) The US finds no direct evidence of Iranian involvement, although it clearly has supplied the attackers; 3) The US does not wish a wider war and has no plans to attack Iran itself. Translated to our enemies, it means an 80-year-old non-compos-mentis president is in no position to prevent, much less win, a theater-wide Middle East war that his own serial appeasement has now nearly birthed. Biden and the Democratic Party know, as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan pointed out just prior to the October 7 attacks on Israel, that the administration inherited a deterred and quiet Middle East. And then it blew up on their appeasing watch. Now they are terrified of a theater-wide conflict breaking out during an election year—a fact known to all of America’s Middle East enemies. Biden and company have forgotten the ancient wisdom that preparing loudly only for peace guarantees war. To prevent war, it should return to oil sanctions on Iran, embargo its banking transactions, slap a travel ban on Iran and its allies, cut off all aid to Hamas and the West Bank, and restore a true terrorist designation for the Houthis. US officials must stop aimlessly babbling. If the administration must speak, Washington should do so by conveying disproportionality and unpredictability. And if, and when, America were to strike, it should do so in silent and devastating fashion. When serially attacked, loudly responding that we will only proportionally strike back and wish no wider war will only ensure a big, ugly one.",

    "text": "Les salariés de Boeing de la région de Seattle, aux Etats-Unis, ont voté hier soir à une très écrasante majorité en faveur d'une grève à partir du vendredi 13 septembre. Cette décision fait suite au rejet de la nouvelle convention proposée par le constructeur aéronautique américain en difficulté. La grève entraînera la fermeture de deux grandes usines d'assemblage d'avions dans la région de Puget Sound (nord-ouest de l'État de Washington). Elle va paralyser la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo, dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards.\nSelon ces salariés, l'accord était bien moins généreux que ne l'affirmaient les dirigeants de Boeing. Cette nouvelle convention, qui concerne les adhérents d'IAM-District 751, tablait sur une augmentation salariale de 25% sur quatre ans ainsi qu'un engagement d'investissements dans la région de Seattle.\nBoeing prend acte de cette décision et \"reste déterminé à rétablir ses relations avec ses employés et le syndicat et est prêt à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord\".",

    "text": "Well, another beautiful week here in the Adirondacks but not so much for the folks down south of us in many states hit by the tail end of Hurricane Helene, which wiped out many small towns that sad to say will probably never recover. The death toll is at over 230 with several people still missing, which is the deadliest hurricane since Katrina. Total losses from wind and flooding are at 30.4 billion and 47.5 billion. Today, another Category 4 Hurricane Milton is heading for the west coast of Florida, which is going to hit right around Tampa before the end of the week.\nThe leaf peepers were out in force over the weekend and so were the kids and adults for Kids Day in Inlet on Saturday Oct. 5. I was out on the fishing raft on Fifth Lake with three waves of young anglers, some of whom had never caught a fish in their young lives. Some did that day, and others did not but they sure tried, and I have pictures to prove it. There had to be 20 young anglers and many adults accompanying their children. At times, fish were sometimes flopping onto the raft and other times there was a lull. First, they were biting on the right side of the raft and other times on the left and children would switch sides to where they were biting. They caught sunfish, perch, fall fish, golden shiners and a couple largemouth bass. One young lady was encouraged to give the bass a kiss and she did before returning it to the water. Some could watch as the fish grabbed their bait, and you almost thought they were going to go in after them in their quest to catch one. I grabbed a couple to keep them from taking a bath in the lake, so we had no swimmers this year or boat drivers this year like we did last year. It was a fun time, and I am sure there will be some returning to catch that big one next year.\nA young lady kissing her fish. Photo by Gary Lee.\nI came off the water and went right to the first ever Kids Day loon calling contest in the town hall. I brought in my loon decoy and the loon caller, which gives the four calls the loons make — hoot, wail, tremolo and yodel. Only the male does the yodel. Sixteen young adults signed up to give the judges — two Environment Conservation Officers and myself — their best loon calls. Most gave it a good shot and a couple backed out with stage fright. Adding up the judges scores we came up the winners for a first, second and third loon caller plaque for their wall. It was a fun time again and some will probably practice before trying again next year now that they know the loon calls. After that they gave out the prizes for the young fishers off the raft, for the biggest, most fish and maybe the smallest as there were some small ones which I think when caught were just holding onto the worm.\nI got out a couple of those beautiful days to fish myself on an area lake for largemouth bass, and we caught a few nice ones both days. It was a hike but well worth the trip and both days the big one got away from me, of course breaking my line both days. I think I better get some new line for my reel. As it has been years since I made that change, and it may be a record breaker the next time. We both caught fish each day and I did get the biggest one each day if only one the second day, I was paddling that day, and it was very windy. The first day it was calm, and my friend caught a fish on his second cast so I could see how this day was going to go but it soon changed after I caught a few and he changed to my color of bait. The biggest caught were seventeen and eighteen inches which weighed more than three pounds each, never did weigh them only put a tape measure on some and released them to grow bigger.\nThe foot traffic was everywhere trying to get the good fall-colored leaves shot. Some great refraction shots could be taken on those calm days during the week and some wildflowers are blooming like the fringed gentians and some New York and New England asters are hanging on for the few monarch butterflies that are still passing through. Parking lots and Rocky and Black Bear mountains were full and the lots to Bald Mountain extended down past Fly Pond on both sides of the road. I guess everybody was a safe hiker as I heard of no carry-outs that day and the weather certainly cooperated, and it only rained overnight.\nOnly another week to catch those beautiful brook trout in area ponds but that’s another story. See ya.\nPhoto at top: Young fisherman in Inlet. Photo by Gary Lee.",

    "text": "Belén Liotti\n(CNN) –– El director de un hospital en el norte de Gaza dijo que ya no pueden hacer frente a la afluencia de personas gravemente heridas y que tuvieron que trasladarlas a otro lugar.\nEl Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director del hospital Kamal Adwan en el norte de Gaza, le dijo a CNN este jueves que civiles gravemente heridos por un ataque aéreo israelí que tuvo lugar el miércoles contra una casa en el área de Beit Lahia no habían podido ser recibidos en el hospital. “Esos casos fueron trasladados a otro hospital por la falta de especialidades necesarias para el manejo de este tipo de lesiones”.\nBlinken afirma que Israel aceptó los términos de la retirada de Gaza en una”propuesta puente”, a pesar de dichos de Netanyahu\nMuchos hospitales de Gaza carecen de personal y equipos después de diez meses de conflicto y la dificultad de acceso a gran parte de Gaza para las organizaciones de ayuda.\nAbu Safiya dijo que había escasez de combustible en Kamal Adwan.\n“Ahora estamos trabajando a la capacidad mínima en la prestación de servicios. La cantidad de combustible que tenemos no es suficiente para más de 24 horas”.\nDijo que alrededor de una decena de niños están en diálisis o con ventiladores. “La falta de combustible significa el fin de la vida de estos niños”.\nAbu Safiya dijo que el combustible llegaba en “cantidades que apenas alcanzan para unos días”.\nDijo que otro problema era la propagación de enfermedades, ya que los programas de vacunación se retrasaron debido al conflicto.\n“Nos han llegado un gran número de enfermedades de la piel e infecciones intestinales (…) Es necesario reactivar las vacunas y tomar las muestras necesarias”.\nA principios de este mes, el Ministro de Salud del Gobierno Autónomo Palestino, el Dr. Majed Abu Ramadan, dijo que Gaza estaba “enfrentando un desastre humanitario en todos los sentidos de la palabra. La agresión ha provocado la destrucción de más del 80% de la infraestructura sanitaria y la mayoría de los hospitales están fuera de servicio”.\nRecuperan en Gaza los cadáveres de seis rehenes israelíes, según las FDI y la Agencia de Seguridad Israelí\nRamadan dijo que los hospitales operativos “están funcionando parcialmente debido a los daños directos y la pérdida de personal médico calificado como consecuencia del desplazamiento forzado que enfrenta nuestro pueblo, así como a la falta de recursos, cortes de energía, escasez de combustible, falta de agua potable, alcantarillado, inundaciones, acumulación de desechos sólidos y propagación de epidemias”.\nEl Ministerio de Salud de Gaza informó el primer caso de polio la semana pasada, que atribuyó al desbordamiento de aguas residuales y a la falta de agua potable.\nDijo que “se han completado los preparativos y arreglos para la campaña de vacunación para combatir la polio, dirigida a niños menores de 10 años, y la campaña está esperando la llegada de vacunas a Gaza”.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Rafa Nadal mantuvo un encuentro con estudiantes de la UAX Rafa Nadal School of Sport en el que volvió a mostrar su compromiso con la excelencia educativa. Recientemente retirado del tenis profesional, visitó el campus de UAX Madrid Chamberí para participar en el evento ‘Rafa Nadal: Más allá del tenis’, una cita que sirvió de inspiración para los futuros profesionales que están apostando por la educación especializada para impulsar su desarrollo y crecimiento en los ámbitos del deporte, el negocio y la salud en la industria deportiva.\nEn una entrevista conducida por la presentadora Susana Guasch, Rafa Nadal ha puesto de relieve la importancia de cultivar un liderazgo basado en valores como la capacidad de mejora constante, la resiliencia, así como la confianza en el equipo. Estos valores son indispensables para triunfar no solo en la esfera deportiva de las competiciones, sino en todas las vertientes profesionales de la industria del deporte.\n«No creo que haya una sola receta, pero sí hay cosas que ayudan, como tener una buena formación, rodearte de personas que tengan un impacto positivo en la vida, así como la determinación, la perseverancia, tener la humildad para escuchar y querer seguir aprendiendo de gente con más experiencia. Y, evidentemente, la disciplina y capacidad de trabajo », ha apuntado.\nLo ha hecho ante un foro integrado por el claustro de profesores de la universidad y más de un centenar de estudiantes del MBA en Sports Management, el Máster en Comunicación Deportiva, el Máster en Rendimiento Deportivo y Salud y el Máster Universitario en Fisioterapia Deportiva, impartidos en UAX Rafa Nadal School of Sport, el proyecto pionero que el propio Nadal ha desarrollado junto a su equipo y la Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio (UAX). Reconocida por el COI como Centro de Estudios e Investigación Olímpicos (CEIO), la universidad destacó que impulsa un modelo multi-deporte en las tres áreas de conocimiento motor de la industria deportiva: salud, deporte y negocio.\nTecnologías Durante el encuentro, Rafa Nadal ha resaltado, además, el papel que juega la tecnología para la salud, el negocio y el deporte, tanto para la experiencia completa que ofrece al espectador como para el desempeño de las carreras de deportista. «La tecnología cambia el deporte. En mi caso, fue poca la tecnología con la que crecí, pero ha tenido una evolución muy grande en el mundo deportivo. Hoy, puedes sacar la información de todos los rivales, lo que hace que el juego tenga una evolución . Aunque yo he seguido confiando en mis sensaciones por mi forma de entender el tenis, por la manera de disfrutarlo de una forma mucho más profunda”, señaló.\nEn la entrevista, en la que los estudiantes han podido hacer preguntas al tenista, Rafa Nadal ha destacado su apuesta por una educación de calidad y su importancia para impulsar una carrera profesional en la industria del deporte , que se encuentra en un momento de plena transformación. Una misión que promueven desde UAX Rafa Nadal School of Sport: «Siempre he creído que educación y deporte van juntos. Nuestro futuro está en manos de la evolución de la industria del deporte y la tecnología. Tenemos que ser lo suficientemente buenos y visionarios para anticipar lo que la industria va a demandar. Y estoy convencido de que tenemos a un equipo en el proyecto preparado para adaptarnos a estas nuevas necesidades », ha defendido.\nCon este encuentro, los estudiantes de UAX Rafa Nadal School of Sports han podido conocer de la mano del deportista las claves y valores para impulsar su carrera profesional. «La industria del deporte en constante evolución requiere una formación de calidad adaptada a las necesidades de talento necesarias en cada momento y ámbito. Una misión que cultivamos desde UAX Rafa Nadal School of Sport abarcando todas las áreas clave en todos los deportes y la involucración de empresas, tecnología y profesionales para potenciar el aprendizaje y la futura empleabilidad de nuestros estudiantes”, explicó Miguel Palencia, director UAX Rafa Nadal School of Sport.\nUn objetivo que se materializa gracias a la participación de los estudiantes en prácticas reales con empresas relevantes de la industria deportiva, como los que recientemente pudieron vivir la experiencia de colaborar en la organización de un gran evento deportivo como es la Copa Davis y próximamente en la Hexagon Cup.",
