    "text": "Médicos de turno en la clínica Los Almendros fueron los encargados de confirmar el lamentable deceso de Tedis Alberto Bossio Martínez, de 46 años y también conocido bajo el alias de Mono Tedy, quien fue víctima de un atentado a bala cuando se movilizaba en una camioneta en la tarde de este miércoles 7 de agosto. El episodio también dejó a otra persona herida. Leer más: “Exigimos más resultados para darle tranquilidad a los barranquilleros” Fueron varias las detonaciones que se escucharon cerca de las 5:00 de la tarde, en la avenida Circunvalar con Cordialidad. Se cree preliminarmente que Bossio Martínez venía en el automotor junto con un hombre identificado como Juan Carlos Silva Ramírez, de 44 años, cuando tras bajar la velocidad fueron sorprendidos por dos motorizados.Los agresores escaparon rápidamente del sitio, mientras que alias Mono Tedy fue foco de la mayor parte de los disparos. Ingresó sin signos vitales al centro asistencial mencionado, mismo donde recibe atención médica su compañero Silva Ramírez. El lugar de los hechos fue acordonado por las autoridades para las respectivas pesquisas.

Muchos de ellos se pueden apreciar en las marcas que quedaron en las ventanas del vehículo. Por su parte, Juan Carlos intenta recuperarse de un balazo en su pierna izquierda.Ambos presentan varias anotaciones judiciales en el Sistema Penal Oral Acusatorio, Spoa, uno por hurto calificado, violencia intrafamiliar y lesiones personales, mientras que el otro por utilización ilícita de equipos transmisores, porte ilegal de arma de fuego e inasistencia alimentaria. No olvide leer: Caso Barlovento: acribillado de más de 20 balazos era alias el Peque Los investigadores a cargo del caso aún no han revelado los móviles que dieron pie a este asesinato, sin embargo no se descarta que los hechos obedezcan a un presunto ajuste de cuentas.Recordemos que el ‘Mono Tedy’ había sido capturado en septiembre de 2020 por tener supuesta responsabilidad en un sonoro robo de $1.478 millones de pesos a una sucursal bancaria ubicada en el barrio Ternera, en Cartagena.

    "title": "Nylander, Woll star as Maple Leafs down Bruins 2-1 to force Game 7",
    "text": "TORONTO — William Nylander scored twice and Joseph Woll made 22 saves as the Toronto Maple Leafs downed the Boston Bruins 2-1 on Thursday to force Game 7 in their first-round series.\nToronto has now won two straight — including Tuesday's 2-1 overtime victory in Game 5 — after falling behind their Original Six rival 3-1 to force a winner-take-all finale Saturday in Boston. Morgan Rielly had two assists.\nJeremy Swayman stopped 24 shots for the Bruins, who also blew a 3-1 lead against the Florida Panthers in last spring's first round before losing in Game 7 following a record-setting regular season. Morgan Geekie scored ruined Woll's shutout with 0.1 seconds left.\nThe Leafs were minus Auston Matthews for a second straight elimination contest after the star centre was pulled from Game 4 with an illness and then missed Tuesday's 2-1 overtime victory at TD Garden that kept Toronto alive.\nThe winner of Leafs-Bruins will take on the well-rested Florida Panthers, who topped the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-1 in that series, in the second round.\nNylander snapped a 0-0 tie with 54.8 seconds left in the middle period with some of his patented Swedish style. The slick winger took a pass from Timothy Liljegren in the offensive zone before weaving away from his check and firing a shot that glanced off Bruins defenceman Charlie McAvoy in front and beat Swayman on the shortside.\nThe goal set off wild celebrations inside an electric Scotiabank Arena — and outside the rink as Maple Leaf Square turned into a mosh pit of blue and white.\nLeafs captain John Tavares had a great chance that whistled just wide before Woll went to work. After a shot pinballed just wide with the Bruins buzzing, the rookie goaltender made a huge stop with the glove on Charlie Coyle in tight to raucous approval.\nBoston continued to press, but Toronto made it 2-0 with 2:13 left in regulation when Nylander moved in alone after taking a pass from Matthew Knies and slid a backhand between Swayman's pads to send the series back to Beantown tied 3-3.\nGeekie scored with 0.1 to spoil Woll's first career shutout.\nThe Leafs battled back from 3-1 deficits against Boston in 2013 and 2018 before losing in seven.\nToronto held a 3-2 lead against the Bruins in 2019, but then dropped two straight for a third series loss against Boston in seven years.\nThe Leafs, who led 12-2 on the shot clock after the first period of Game 5, came out flying again Thursday with a couple good chances in a physical opening 20 minutes that saw the teams combine for 48 hits.\nToronto's power play had some decent looks on its first opportunity, but dropped to 1-for-18 in the series before Knies — Tuesday's OT hero — had a great chance on Swayman's doorstep at the buzzer as the home side outshot Boston 21-1.\nLeafs defenceman Jake McCabe had a terrific look from the slot early in the second before Boston star David Pastrnak took a double-minor for high-sticking, but Toronto again could get nothing going with the man advantage.\nThe Bruins finally registered their second shot more than 27 minutes into the game, and Woll had to be sharp on a couple Pastrnak efforts and a Jake DeBrusk chance.\nToronto's under-fire penalty kill — with six goals against in 14 chances these playoffs coming into Thursday — held firm later in the period.\nWoll had to make two big stops with the teams back even off McAvoy's stick to set the stage for Nylander at the other end.\nSTANDING WOLL\nThe 25-year-old became the first goaltender in NHL history to have each of his first four career playoff starts come in potential elimination games. Thatcher Demko (2020), Michael Hutchinson (2020) and Manny Fernandez (2003) are the only other netminders to have their first three starts come in win-or-go home contests.\nREAVO SITS\nLeafs enforcer Ryan Reaves was a healthy scratch. Toronto winger Noah Gregor saw his first action of the series.\nHEINEN ABSENT\nThe Bruins were without forward Danton Heinen. Head coach Jim Montgomery said following Boston's morning skate he's listed as day-to-day. John Beecher took Heinen's spot in the lineup.\nVeteran defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk returned to the fold after being replaced by Matt Grzelyk in Game 5.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 2, 2024.\n___\nFollow @JClipperton_CP on X.\nJoshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Dopage: Tadej Pogacar, l’écœurement d’un coureur français\nPublié le\nAlors que Tadej Pogacar s’avance une fois encore comme le principal favori du Tour de France 2025, certains vivent mal de devoir se contenter de miettes.\nA deux jours du début du Tour de France, Tadej Pogacar fait office d’immense favori à sa propre succession. L’an passé, le Slovène avait écrasé la course, remportant pas moins de six étapes et reléguant son plus proche poursuivant à plus de six minutes, et sa nouvelle démonstration de force lors du récent Critérium du Dauphiné, face à Jonas Vingegaard et Remco Evenepoel, n’incite pas à l’otpimisme pour ses rivaux.\nA en croire Bernard Hinault, sa victoire semble effectivement acquise. « À part s’il a une grosse défaillance, mais je n’y crois pas du tout. Quand on voit ce qu’il a pu faire au Dauphiné, il a maîtrisé, il a fait ce qu’il voulait quand il voulait », a-t-il ainsi confié auprès de l’AFP.\nEt pour Antoine Vayer, pourfendeur du dopage, le sacre annoncé de Tadej Pogacar ne fait pas plus de doute. « C’est un spectacle de dupes. Si on veut voir des sportifs, il faut regarder cinq minutes derrière Pogacar, qui s’est envolé », a-t-il confié auprès du média Tocsin, ajoutant : « Le Tour fait 3 300 km et on ne rigole pratiquement pas si on disait que si Pogacar faisait ces 3 300 km tout seul, il avancerait aussi vite que tout le peloton. Ça n’a plus aucun sens. »\nL’écœurement est palpable et partagé par certains coureurs. « J’étais avec un coureur, qui est vertueux, il y a même pas une semaine et je lui dis ‘Tu vas peut-être finir 10e.‘ et il me répond ‘Oui, mais à combien ? 40 minutes ?‘ Ils le savent très bien. Tout le monde sait ce qu’il va se passer, comment ça va se passer », a-t-il enchaîné.\nL’an passé tandis que Jonas Vingegaard avait terminé avec plus de six minutes de retard, le quatrième, Joao Almeida, avait échoué au pied du podium avec près de vingt minutes de débours et le retard du 10e, Santiao Buitrago, flirtait avec les 30 minutes. Quand au premier Français, Guillaume Martin, il affichait près de trois quart d’heure de retard.\nA deux jours du début du Tour de France, Tadej Pogacar fait office d’immense favori à sa propre succession.

    "title": "Why Are Some Catholics Taking the Wrong Path of Eastern \"Orthodoxy\"?",
    "text": "Why Are Some Catholics Taking the Wrong Path of Eastern “Orthodoxy”? The crisis inside the Catholic Church has turned everything upside down. Tired of liturgical renovations , many Catholics are looking for more traditional expressions of worship. Others lament the “feminization” of some progressive services and seek out less emotional and more affirmative models of faith. Tragically, these searches sometimes lead outside the Church.\nOne wrong path to this religious ideal is Eastern “Orthodoxy.” According to a New York Post article , many young people, especially men, are joining these schismatic sects where they hope to find solace in their ancient liturgies, challenging austerity and penitential fasting. These sensorial and physical attributes of Eastern “Orthodoxy” are attractive to image-driven generations and those who crave religious experiences.\nHowever, such individuals would do well to listen to another pensive and larger group of truth-seekers before taking the plunge into schism. This group is comprised of Eastern “Orthodox” Christians who are converting to the Catholic Church. These pilgrims say: Beware! Not all that glitters is gold. Not all smoke is incense. If you are seeking the Truth, look only to the Holy Roman Catholic Church.\nEternal and Natural Law: The Foundation of Morals and Law Search for Stability\nOn the surface, Eastern “Orthodoxy” appears as something solid and immovable amid the crisis. The ancient liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom (taken from the Catholic Church) is full of mystery and beauty that attracts the spiritually famished. In the face of such apparent solidity, the temptation is to embrace it wholeheartedly.\nHowever, Eastern “Orthodox” Christians heading toward Catholicism see it differently. They say that one must look beyond these attractive externals. They list major problems with “Orthodoxy,” like impoverished doctrinal foundations and incredible disunity, as reasons to look toward Rome, its present apocalyptic crisis notwithstanding.\nThese new Catholic converts find comfort in the solidity of traditional perennial Catholic teaching and its magisterial structures, which have no equivalent in the doctrinally dormant Eastern sects.\nA Clash of Doctrines\nIndeed, the new truth-seekers find it hard to believe that well-known Catholic converts like Rod Dreher abandoned Rome to embrace Eastern schism.\nOne Russian truth-searcher, Max Grigorieff, writing recently in OnePeterFive , asks why a Catholic would “join one of those churches that allows contraception and literally dozens of official grounds for so-called ‘Christian divorce’ open to remarriage, having almost no trouble in giving Holy Communion to these people” or “allowing a widowed and abandoned priest to get a new wife?”\nMr. Grigorieff notes that all these aberrations (and more) exist inside Eastern “Orthodoxy.” Moreover, while its liturgy seems frozen in time, so-called Orthodoxy’s doctrinal development is frozen in the eighth century and largely unorthodox. The confession has no fixed body of doctrines or magisterium from which to draw inspiration to resolve modern problems that confront the faithful. It does not even have the mechanisms in place to allow it to develop doctrine or enforce unity on key belief issues.\nLearn All About the Prophecies of Our Lady of Good Success About Our Times A second problem is that these Catholics are converting to something that does not exist. There is no universal “Orthodox” Church. Eastern “Orthodoxy” is a gaggle of fragmented churches engaged in an ongoing civil war. One federation of churches prohibits interaction with others. Some even go to the point of sacrilege by re-baptizing members of enemy “Orthodox” factions.\nThe fragmentation extends to doctrinal disagreements. Like the Protestants, “Orthodoxy” holds a multitude of opinions and beliefs since there is no unifying authority to pronounce upon and settle divisive issues. The different sects disagree on some matters vital for salvation, “like the efficacy of the Sacraments.” Many factions were influenced by Protestant heresies that departed from the deposit of the faith.\nLack of Social Teaching\nGreg Cook, a young American truth-seeker, also chronicles his spiritual journey from “Orthodoxy” to Catholicism in another article in OnePeterFive . He started his conversion process by looking at the role of social teaching.\nHe notes a lack of well-developed social doctrine among “Orthodox” sects since they rely upon patristics—the teachings found in the early Church fathers. This patristic vision places much more emphasis on monasticism and asceticism, which were developing in the early Church. As a result, the schismatics never developed a body of teachings that concentrated on social doctrine and organization.\nMr. Cook also criticizes the lack of unity among the different sects, which makes any agreement on social teaching impossible. “Orthodox” leaders do not even take advantage of the positive developments of social teachings of the Catholic Church since they harbor a reflexive and visceral hostility toward anything Western, especially Roman.\nIn one of his university papers, Mr. Cook, still not a Catholic, asserted that due to ethnic and national separations and internal fights, the “Orthodox” do not “share a worldwide mission of philanthropy and charity.”\nHe later concluded in another paper: “The genius of Catholicism is that it is a Faith for all places, all people, and all times. The Church’s social teaching is the application of Christ’s message for the world. Justice and charity know no borders.”\nThe Allure of Liturgy Without Doctrinal Moorings\nThe testimonies of these recent pilgrims from “Orthodoxy” to Catholicism are just two of many such conversions of those who sense the shortcomings of the Eastern schismatic sects and now rejoice in their communion with the Catholic Church.\nThese voices should serve as warnings for those attracted by the allure and trappings of ancient liturgy without doctrinal moorings or visible unity.\n10 Razones Por las Cuales el “Matrimonio” Homosexual es Dañino y tiene que Ser Desaprobado Indeed, there is an immense spiritual hunger for God, His Law and His worship, especially among the newer generations . This hunger must find its expression in a visible Church though which God manifests Himself to humanity and is found in the Catholic Church.\nThe terrible crisis inside the Church and society makes the search for the spiritual much more difficult. It creates the temptation to reduce the Faith to mere external practices.\nHowever, the former “Orthodox” pilgrims show that conversion is possible for those who listen to the voice of God’s Grace. Those seeking the Truth must be attentive lest they stray from the right path.\nClick Here to Like Traditional Values Photo Credit: © nastyakamysheva – stock.adobe.com",

    "text": "Members of Pasadena’s Clergy Community Coalition (CCC) & Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance (IMA) march up Orange Grove Blvd. toward ‘TV Corner’ at Colorado Blvd. on Saturday, Dec. 30, 2023. [Photo by Blake Hill, W.N.S. Media L.L.C.] Continuing its annual tradition, more than 100 members of the Clergy Community Coalition (CCC) and Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance (IMA), gathered at Maranatha High School Saturday for a prayer breakfast before marching to the corner of Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevard for a blessing over the upcoming Rose Parade. Pastor and Board Chair Kerwin Maddox welcomed the clergy members, and peering out the windows, noticed the sunlight rising from the eastern skies, remarked that he thought the weather would be sunny for the Monday parade. State Assemblymember Chris Holden, who helped originate the prayer breakfast and walk event, told the group, “I think that clearly when you have an alliance, a ministerial alliance and a clergy coalition coming together, coalitions and an alliance, that means something special.” “You’re a small group representing a large community,” Holden continued. “And I can tell you that two years in a row we’ve had rain. Now we did break the rain, so we can’t be surprised when it happens, but sometimes we have to know that on the other side of the rain are rainbows. “And so with rainbows come new beginnings, so as we go into this new year, let us pray for and accept and expect new beginnings.” Reverend Eric Johnson talked about growing up in Pasadena and seeing its transition over the years: “I remember ‘Negro Days’ at Brookside Park and the pool being drained after we left,” he said, “but that doesn’t exist anymore. We take students on tours of Caltech because they had no idea that at that great institution, sat architects of eugenics. But that doesn’t exist anymore. Those names are not on buildings anymore. And it’s important for me to show students that because I want them to have hope when they seek justice, but I also want them to know that sometimes hope and justice takes time. “And so,” he continued, “we need to constantly refill our well with hope and not get the surge. Because what we see will not always be, as we’re told in Second Corinthians, that we are to look not at the things that are seen, but the things that are unseen because the things that are seen are temporary.” Following the breakfast, the group boarded a bus to Tournament House where they gathered for more prayers and a land blessing, before assembling for their march. Dozens of the coalition members marched slowly north on Orange Grove behind a Pasadena Police Department SUV, before turning right on Colorado, where they gathered together along the street at “TV Corner,” for various prayers and blessings for a safe and dry Rose Parade.
