    "title": "¿Qué tiempo hará en Galicia en Fin de Año?",
    "text": "Los últimos días de 2023 estarán marcados en Galicia por una profunda borrasca situada al oeste de Irlanda. Sin embargo, el mal tiempo dará una tregua justo para celebrar el Fin de Año. Esta es la predicción de MeteoGalicia. La predicción para el sábado 30 de diciembre La entrada de un frente atlántico por el noroeste producirá este sábado precipitaciones débiles y dispersas en Galicia. Al final de la jornada se esperan fuertes vientos. Este temporal obligó a activar la alerta naranja en la costa de A Coruña por mar de viento. En la de Lugo y Pontevedra el aviso será amarillo por vientos de fuerza 7. En tierra también habrá alerta amarilla en las comarcas costeras de A Mariña y A Coruña, además de en las zonas de montaña de Lugo y Ourense, por vientos de más de 80 km/h. Las temperaturas serán propias de la época, con mínimas que oscilarán desde los 5 grados en Lugo a los 9º en Pontevedra y máximas que alcanzarán los 16º en Ferrol y A Coruña. La predicción para el domingo 31 de diciembre El temporal remitirá el último día del año, con el tiempo justo para celebrar Nochevieja sin lluvia. La situación, apunta MeteoGalicia, será tranquila en tierra durante el domingo, aunque en el mar las olas continuarán superando los cuatro metros en mar abierto. Venres e sábado agardamos tempo tranquilo. Pero, como virá a— MeteoGalicia (@MeteoGalicia) [#Noitevella]🥳? Estaremos entre dúas borrascas: A primeira deixará chuvia na mañá do 31 e a segunda na mañá do día 1. No medio quedaría tempo seco e frío. Pero todo pende dun fío. Atentos ás pantallas😉 [pic.twitter.com/zhRVYnjZKi] [December 28, 2023] La predicción para el lunes 1 de enero El año arrancará de nuevo con lluvias. A partir del lunes regresarán las precipitaciones en Galicia. Y no habrá cambios en los primeros días de 2024, en los que se espera que el cielo esté condicionado por un tren de borrascas.",

    "text": "MCPHERSON, Kansas (Video from KAKE, FAMILY PHOTOS, MARY PETERSON, CNN, Family Photos/Mary Peterson) — A 96-year-old Kansas woman who comes from a military family annually sends thousands of holiday cards to members of the military who can’t be home for the holidays.\n\"I think only had 7,000 the first year. But then I had 8,000 last year and 8,000 again this year,” Mary Peterson of McPherson, Kansas, told KAKE .\nAdvertisement Mary has been sending the cards to troops since 2020. In that time, more than 23,000 cards have been delivered to U.S. Army Fort Riley in North Central Kansas and then sent around the world to those who serve in the military.\nKeeping the arts of handwriting and letter-writing alive, the cards — which bear messages written in beautiful cursive writing — say things like, \"God bless you and keep you safe. That is my prayer for you. Grandma Mary, McPherson, Kansas.\"\nShe hopes military members hold the cards near and dear.\n\"I hope that makes them realize that there's somebody that still loves them and loves what they're doing,” she said.\nAnd, Mary hopes the cards hold special meaning for troops who don’t regularly receive letters.\n\"There's so many heartaches and broken homes and people went to the service because it was something else for them to do. And they won't hear from family because they've lost their connection,” she explained to KAKE.\nGrandfather reads bedtime stories to thousands of kids on YouTube While she’s been sending the cards since 2020, Mary is no stranger to sending letters to soldiers.\nThat’s because, when Mary was in high school, her older brother served overseas, and she was sure to send him a weekly letter.\nHer husband also served in World War II and she said she knows what it’s like to have a loved one overseas during the holidays.\nMary told KAKE that her age won’t stop her from keeping up her tradition of sending handwritten cards and that she will continue to send them to troops for as long as her hands will let her write.\nShe said she can write about 50 cards per day. She starts filling them out in the summertime, according to KAKE’s reporting.\nMary isn’t alone in her mission of getting cards in the hands of U.S. military members. Annually, members of the local community, which is located around 62 miles outside of Wichita, donate blank cards.\nSee more in the video player above.\nMilitary veteran gets service dog back on Christmas\nTop Picks Shrek's Swamp, Barbie DreamHouse, 'Ted Lasso' pub: Unique Airbnb listings from 2023 ‘Really?’: Moose caught on camera looks shocked, annoyed when he 'pies' himself in the face with snow Man reunites with firefighter who rescued him from burning home 45 years ago A North Carolina 3-year-old opens entire family's Christmas presents in the middle of the night",

    "text": "Less than two years after it first hit the skies, Canada Jetlines has grounded its planes and ceased operations amid a cash crisis that caused it to become the third Canadian carrier in less than a year to stop flying.\nThe low-cost airline, which flew mainly to sun destinations out of Toronto on top of leases and charter trips, said Thursday it failed to find the capital needed to stay afloat and planned to file for creditor protection.\n\"The company ... pursued all available financing alternatives including strategic transactions and equity and debt financings,\" said spokeswoman Erica Dymond in a release.\n\"Unfortunately despite these efforts, the company has been unable to obtain the financing required to continue operations at this time.\"\nPassengers with existing bookings should contact their credit card company to secure refunds, she said. \"Every effort is being made to assist passengers at this time.\"\nTrading of the company's shares on the NEO Exchange was halted late Wednesday afternoon.\nThe shutdown follows the resignation of four board members on Monday, including chairwoman and CEO Brigitte Goersch.\nIt signals yet another airline departure from Canadian skies after the closure of Lynx Air in February and budget carrier Swoop last October as concerns about domestic competition persist.\n\"Any time you lose some competition in the Canadian market it's kind of sad for the travellers, because it puts less pressure on prices,\" said Jacques Roy, a professor of transport management at HEC Montreal business school.\nFounded in 2013 as a would-be charter airline, Canada Jetlines accounted for only a fraction of scheduled flights to sun destinations, he qualified.\nThe shutdown also underscores the challenges of running a carrier in a vast country with a diffuse population and only a few key air travel hubs.\n\"Every time a new player wants to enter the market, there's only one certainty: they're going to be losing money for the first eight, nine, 10 months at least, and perhaps even more. So you need a good bank account,\" said Roy, noting that leisure travellers are particularly price-sensitive.\n\"The major players will play the game of meeting your fares. And if you reduce your fares below your cost, then that's a recipe for failure in the short term,\" he said.\n\"It's a tough market.\"\nUntil Thursday, Jetlines was flying a few dozen flights per month from Toronto to Miami and Orlando, Fla., as well as Cancun, Mexico, according to aviation tracking firm Cirium.\nIt also flew charter flights, including for three Canadian Football League teams. The airline signed contracts with the Ottawa Redblacks, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts that saw it haul players to select away games last season. The Redblacks contract was a three-year deal that may no longer be fulfilled.\nThursday's halt leaves only one budget carrier left in Canada — Flair Airlines — alongside the other major players: Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and the WestJet-owned Sunwing Airlines.\nLast month, competition commissioner Matthew Boswell launched a market study of domestic airline service amid passengers' ongoing frustration with prices and quality.\nCanada Jetlines, which has struggled to get more than a handful of planes off the ground since its inaugural flight in September 2022, faced a series of hiccups even before this week's turbulence.\nOn June 30, Eddy Doyle stepped down as CEO after taking on the role in 2021. In October 2022, former Quebec premier Jean Charest resigned from the board.\nThe challenges it faced in its home market were evident.\nIn January 2023, it pressed pause on domestic routes as the carrier refocused on sun destinations and leasing its planes, but said at the time it aimed to resume in-country flights that fall.\nLast April, it signed over a pair of Airbus narrow-body jets to a European carrier for most of the remaining year in a so-called wet lease — where the lessor furnishes the aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance for another company. It also deployed two more planes for flights between Morocco and Western Europe in a three-month agreement with Air Arabia.\nIn October 2019, the Mississauga, Ont.-based company announced it was postponing its planned December launch and laying off most employees after failing to secure the required financing and losing investment partners. The delay wound up dragging on for nearly three years, thanks in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThat 2019 setback followed six years of fundraising and despite Ottawa lifting the foreign ownership ceiling on Canadian airlines to 49 per cent from 25 per cent in 2018, allowing for a wider pool of investors.\nCanada Jetlines lost $14.2 million over the 12 months between March 2023 and last March, though it eked out a profit in one of the quarters, according to financial filings. Quarterly revenues ranged between $8 million and $12 million.\nIn May, the company secured a $2-million loan from Square Financial Investment Corp., a Mississauga-based holding company owned by board member Reg Christian, who was named executive vice-president as a result.\nJetlines had a $38.3-million deficit and negative working capital of $14.9 million as of March 31.\nAs recently as May 10, the company said in financial statements it planned to grow to seven planes by year's end and 15 aircraft by 2026.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.\nChristopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Bluesky ha 15 milioni di utenti. Questo è il numero totale di nuovi utenti che Threads ha aggiunto in un mese, dice il suo capo. Bluesky potrebbe essere in crescita, ma a Meta non vogliamo che le persone dimentichino Instagram e Threads. Il loro manager, Adam Mosseri, tiene a sottolineare che Threads è ancora più imponente. In un post di giovedì, Mosseri ha affermato che Threads ha registrato “oltre 15 milioni di iscrizioni solo nel mese di novembre”, minimizzando così l’annuncio di Bluesky di aver raggiunto 15 milioni di utenti totali mercoledì. Meta ha inoltre ribadito che la piattaforma registra più di 1 milione di iscrizioni al giorno, una statistica rivelata dal suo CEO Mark Zuckerberg durante la presentazione degli utili del mese scorso. Ha inoltre osservato che la piattaforma osserva questo volume di registrazioni da “tre mesi”. Molti utenti si sono rivolti a Bluesky alla ricerca di una nuova piattaforma per abbandonare X. Sulla rete sempre più politicizzata di Elon Musk, gli utenti hanno espresso preoccupazioni riguardo all’incentivazione del coinvolgimento, alla moderazione dei problemi, alla disinformazione e al feed di notizie algoritmico. Alcune critiche sono rivolte anche a Threads. Adam Mosseri ha riconosciuto che “abbiamo ancora molto lavoro da fare” e ha affermato che i team dell’azienda “stanno lavorando duramente per fornire a questa comunità ciò di cui ha bisogno”. Meta prevede di introdurre presto annunci pubblicitari su Threads, che potrebbero non essere ben accolti. Meta ha anche riferito che Threads non chiede più ai nuovi utenti se vogliono seguire tutti quelli che già seguono su Instagram. “È da un po’ che stiamo eseguendo un test e sembra che le persone preferiscano costruire una rete diversa su Threads rispetto a quella che hanno su Instagram”, ha detto il suo rappresentante. AdamAnd Mosseri sembra essere aperto all’esplorazione di un sistema di messaggistica privato specifico per i thread. In questo momento, la messaggistica privata è uno dei maggiori vantaggi di Bluesky rispetto a Threads. Business",

    "text": "On Wednesday, Georgia football offensive line coach Stacey Searels was announced to have been hospitalized with pneumonia after not traveling with the team to Miami, Florida. Searelsis expected to make a full recovery.\nSearels is in his second year with Georgia as the team’s offensive line coach and has helped the unit be finalists for the Joe Moore Award — which is given to the best offensive line unit in college football — for the past two seasons.\nGeorgia offensive analyst Manrey Saint-Amour will step in during Searels’ absence. Saint-Amour was previously an offensive line coach at Charleston Southern in 2022 and served as an offensive line graduate assistant at both Alabama and Florida State before then. Saint-Amour was formerly a center with Georgia Southern, in which he made 36 career starts and was a first-team All-Sun Belt selection as a senior in 2014.\nWhile Searels didn’t travel, new Georgia defensive backs coach Donte Williams did travel with the team and was coaching the secondary at practice.\nAdditionally, certain players did not travel with the team. Right tackle Amarius Mims did not travel with the team and will seemingly not play on Saturday. Tight end Brock Bowers is working back from his ankle injury, but the tight ends coach Todd Hartley said he may play if he returns to full health. Freshman edge rusher Damon Wilson Jr. also didn’t travel due to receiving knee surgery.\nWhile those three did not make the trip, several others did, including several incoming freshmen that have been practicing with the team leading up to the trip.\nCornerback Daniel Harris and kicker Jared Zirkel, who both entered the transfer portal, also made the trip down and unlike those previously mentioned, can play.\nBoth Ladd McConkey and Julian Humphrey were both questionable to play in this game due to injury, but both were on the field. Humphrey was specifically in a black non-contact jersey, while McConkey wasn’t, signaling that the redshirt junior would likely play on Saturday against the Seminoles. McConkey confirmed on Thursday that he will play.\nWhile Georgia seemingly only has one hold-out in Mims, Florida State’s holdouts include Keon Coleman, Johnny Wilson, tight end Jaheim Bell and running back Trey Benson on offense and defensive lineman Fabien Lovett and Jared Verse and cornerback Akeem Dent on defense. Quarterback Tate Rodemaker, who initially started for injured starter Jordan Travis, will also not play after entering the transfer portal.\nFreshman Brock Glenn, who started in the ACC Championship and had a rough performance, will make his second start against Georgia. Against Louisville, Glenn had an abysmal 38% completion rate, 55 yards and no touchdowns.\nBoth teams will be working with depleted quarterback rooms after transfers departed the team. Georgia likely holds the advantage with returning starter Carson Beck alongside most of the team returning.",
