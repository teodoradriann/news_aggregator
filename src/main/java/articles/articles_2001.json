    "text": "美媒:“学编程保饭碗”不再可靠\n曾几何时，学计算机被视为通往高薪工作与精英阶层的捷径。2005年至2023年间，美国计算机专业的学生人数翻了4倍，各大高校的编程课堂人满为患。但如今，这场狂热正在降温。\n最新数据显示，2025年美国计算机专业的招生人数几乎停滞，全国增幅仅为0.2%，斯坦福、普林斯顿等名校甚至出现下滑趋势。普林斯顿计算机系主任鲁辛凯维奇透露，按当前趋势，两年内该校计算机专业毕业生人数将减少1/4。杜克大学的相关专业入门课程报名人数也骤降20%。这一现象背后的原因是，人工智能（AI）的扩张正导致技术行业裁员不断、招聘冻结。AI不仅能写文章，更擅长写代码，甚至威胁到了它的缔造者——程序员。皮尤研究中心调查显示，美国人普遍认为，软件工程师是受生成式AI冲击最大的职业群体。\n“这太讽刺了。”布鲁金斯学会研究员莫莉·金德感叹，“原本，学编程是抵御技术淘汰的保障，如今，这条路本身却岌岌可危。”一度流行的“学编程，保饭碗”口号，正变得不再可靠。田纳西大学博士生克里斯·格罗普的经历尤为典型。拥有计算机、数学等多个学历的他，苦苦求职8个月却颗粒无收。他的同学中，有人投出600份简历才艰难拿到录用通知。更讽刺的是，格罗普专攻的正是热门的AI方向，“我成天研究AI革命的核心技术，却找不到工作。”他无奈地说，甚至一度考虑放弃多年努力，转行做电工。\n这并非个例。数据显示，22至27岁的年轻人中，其他领域就业人数略有上升，唯独计算机与数学岗位下降了8%。过去，斯坦福、伯克利、卡内基梅隆大学的毕业生是科技巨头争抢的“香饽饽”，如今，他们也不得不主动四处求职。\n更大的矛盾是，许多初级程序员正是被AI取代。谷歌、微软高管公开表示，AI已参与甚至主导约1/4的代码编写。微软刚刚裁员6000人，AI公司Anthropic则直接用聊天机器人取代低阶员工。该公司高管预测，5年内，AI可能取代半数初级岗位。金德更担忧，企业或许将彻底砍掉“职场阶梯”的底层，让年轻白领无处落脚。\n也有人认为，技术行业的起伏本就是常态，经济环境、利率变动、贸易政策同样影响深远。哈佛教授大卫·德明表示，AI是否重塑就业市场，还需时间观察。过去，计算机专业的冷热随就业市场波动而变化。每次低谷过后，薪资上涨又会吸引更多学生回流。麻省理工学院教授萨姆·马登相信，AI技术最终反而会刺激对真正技术人才的需求。\n在不确定的时代，经济学家建议，年轻人不妨选择那些“耐久型”技能，文科背景反而可能成为黑马。数据显示，历史、社会科学等专业的男性毕业生，长期来看收入不逊色于工科同行，因为他们具备雇主青睐的“软技能”。“学一门具体技术，听起来稳赚不赔，实则充满风险。”德明说，“真正有价值的，是能够陪伴你走完40多年职场生涯、经得起时间考验的思维能力和内在涵养。”（作者罗斯·霍罗维奇，蒋礼译）\n美国《大西洋月刊》6月21日文章，原题：计算机科学泡沫正在破裂",

En menos de un mes, las tiendas empezarán a llenarse de abalorios y ofertas y, por supuesto, los precios de todo lo que tenga que ver con las Navidades subirá.

En [Ikea](https://www.elnacional.cat/es/consumo/esta-salsa-salmon-bate-records-venta-en-ikea_1297147_102.html), donde saben mucho de planes a medio plazo, te ayudan a hacerlo y, por eso, ofrecen ya árboles de Navidad. Parece natural, pero no lo es El árbol que nos presenta Ikea este mes mide 210 cm de alto y está fabricado en acero y plástico. El acero, por supuesto, da forma al tronco y las ramas y el plástico, a las agujas que, pese a su nombre, no pintan. Los diseñadores de [Ikea](https://www.elnacional.cat/es/consumo/mesilla-noche-hay-mas-hogares-espana-esta-en-ikea_1295733_102.html) han elegido para este árbol (Vinterfint se llama) dos materiales: el plástico de polietileno y el plástico de polipropileno. En ambos casos, proceden en más de un 50% de materiales reciclados. No se degrada y, por supuesto, aguanta más de una y dos Navidades. Menos de 100 euros En la web o las tiendas de[ Ikea](https://www.elnacional.cat/es/consumo/amantes-gourmeteria-van-ikea-por-este-salmon_1297891_102.html), un ejemplar de Vinterfint cuesta 99,99 euros.

    "text": "They confronted the HR department, only to be met with dismissive responses and a lack of understanding.\nAt times, even after giving our best, we do not get what we deserve. We must then stand up for our rights and speak for ourselves. A group of ten workers did this when they were denied a raise and the basic amenities that they needed at the workplace. They had first made a request but it went unheard so they decided to skip work on one day and meet at a coworker's place. [u/UnoriginallyGeneric](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/14rjtn4/ten_of_us_left_our_work_on_monday_and_it_feels_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) shared, \"So, up until Monday, I was a lead shipper and receiver and forklift operator for a regional health care company. I supervised five people in my department. Unlike many industries, we never shuttered during COVID.\"\nShe added, \"We kept everyone throughout the pandemic. What's more, nobody caught COVID during the time due to, well due diligence on our part, as well as having a COVID immunization clinic that came to our door.\" She continued, \"So, while the office staff was successful in negotiating raises to stay at home, we got to thinking: our cost of living has gone up. Gas became more expensive, and we still have to come in, why aren't we allowed a sizeable raise?\"\n\"I mean, the sales staff only have to come in once every two weeks for half a day, why should they get a big raise when we still had to drive in each day? HR came in twice a week at best, and our accounts payable/receivable person hadn't been in the office for two years: trust me, we know,\" the employee noted.\nThe group of workers expressed their dissatisfaction to the HR department, highlighting that they were overworked, underpaid, and deeply frustrated. They emphasized the importance of having content and motivated individuals responsible for distributing their products and maintaining optimal facility conditions. However, the HR department responded dismissively, revealing their lack of understanding and awareness. In an example of their cluelessness, a representative questioned why a functioning forklift couldn't be utilized instead of one that was out of order but still operable.\nThe situation escalated further when the HR department claimed they lacked the necessary funds. At this point, tensions reached a boiling point. As the lead in the logistics department, the individual confronted the HR representative directly, making it clear that they were well aware of the organization's incoming resources, expenses and pricing strategies.\n\"So, we left the meeting, not a dollar richer, and even more frustrated but I did have an ace up my sleeve: one of my oldest friends from high school was promoted to VP of logistics at another company: when I informed him of my issues where we were, he said that they were looking to staff a new warehouse,\" the employee added. \"We started to discuss numbers, and after a week he was able to offer the ten of us employment contracts for everything we all asked for but was denied. Contracts in hand, it was an easy sell to convince everyone to sign.\"\n\"Within the day everyone signed and had a two-week notice letter drafted to HR. Eventually, she panicked and offered me basically everything we asked for: but we declined and said that we were done.\"\nPeople were quick to rally around the employee and their group for standing up to their workplace. [u/expressionkeeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/14rjtn4/comment/jqtqdxv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) commented, \"My old manager tried to do that 'I don’t accept your resignation' BS, and she had the audacity to deny me full-time benefits, no wonder so many people left during my short time there, glad I was able to join them.\" [u/NocuturnalRob](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/14rjtn4/comment/jqswpuc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) noted, \"Congratulations.

    "text": "The Biden administration’s recent “parole in place” initiative is a step in the right direction. It will keep families together by opening a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people, many of whom have called the U.S. home for decades. But declared just weeks after a separate order to shut the door on people fleeing persecution, President Joe Biden’s paired rollout of immigration actions bolsters the dangerous, long-standing thinking that relief for some immigrants must come at the expense of others. These Biden policies come amid claims from the GOP that we have “open borders” — when nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, migrants are arriving in high numbers, which is unsurprising given backlogs at the border from Donald Trump’s policies and COVID-19 restrictions, multiple failed governments in this hemisphere, and the impacts of climate change. And the federal government has failed to organize a coordinated response, putting unnecessary strain on major cities and reinforcing the idea of a “crisis.”\nAdvertisement Well-meaning people wonder why today’s immigrants don’t just come here “the right way,” presumably by filling out forms and waiting their turn. And the assumption, whether acknowledged or not, is that past generations of immigrants followed the rules.\nAdvertisement The ancestors of most white Americans came to the U.S. when there were no immigration rules — no visas, no passports, no work permits.

    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs defeat Miami Dolphins in conditions so cold that head coach Andy Reid’s mustache freezes\nCNN\nBy Jacob Lev, CNN\n(CNN) — The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins 26-7 at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday, in conditions so cold that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid’s mustache froze over.\nThe temperature at kickoff was -4 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -20 degrees, making it\nthe fourth coldest game in National Football League history, according to the Peacock broadcast.\nPictures of Reid with icicles in his facial hair have since gone viral on social media.\nAmid the brutal conditions, the Kansas City offense hit the ground running, marching down the field on the opening drive and capping it off with an 11-yard touchdown throw from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Rashee Rice. Rice would go on to finish the game with eight receptions for 130 yards.\nThe Chiefs never looked back, shutting down the Dolphins offense completely.\nChiefs’ kicker Harrison Butker went 4 for 4 on field goals and running back Isiah Pacheco ran it in for a three-yard rushing touchdown to put the game on ice (literally) in the fourth quarter.\nMahomes finished the game with 262 yards and a touchdown.\nTaylor Swift was in attendance and braved the frigid temperatures wearing a #87 Kelce jacket in support of her beau Travis Kelce. Kelce finished the game with seven receptions for 71 yards.\nAt the end of the game, the temperature was -9 degrees and felt like -28 degrees, according to the broadcast.\nPlayers could be seen huddling by pitch-side heaters and many made the most of heated benches in a bid to keep out the cold.\nMahomes downplayed the weather, saying “it is what it is” when asked about it on the Peacock broadcast after the game.\n“We’re in Kansas City, at Arrowhead,” Mahomes said. “We are going to play in some games like this. So, our mentality was to come out here, play football and see what happens.”\nStill, Saturday’s conditions are rivaled by the coldest NFL game on record: the December 1967 “Ice Bowl” in Wisconsin, when the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys amid -13 air temperature and a -48 wind chill, according to the NFL.\nEarlier on Saturday, the Houston Texans defeated the Cleveland Browns 45-14.\nIt was a historic day for rookie Texans quarterback CJ Stroud, who threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns. Stroud’s three touchdown passes tied a rookie record in a playoff game. The 23-year-old former second-overall pick also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history.\nThe NFL playoffs continue on Sunday with the Green Bay Packers heading to Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. Matthew Stafford will also make his grand return to the city where he started his NFL career when the Los Angeles Rams take on the Detroit Lions.\nOn Monday, the Pittsburgh Steelers head to a snowy Orchard Park, New York, to take on the Buffalo Bills and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Philadelphia Eagles.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
