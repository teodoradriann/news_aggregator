    "text": "Barranquilla a otro nivel, fue la consigna con la que se posicionó el alcalde de Barranquilla, Alejandro Char, la mañana de este viernes en el barrio Rebolo, al suroriente de la ciudad. Durante su discurso hizo un recorrido por algunos logros que alcanzó en sus diferentes mandatos y señaló los nuevos desafíos que iniciará el próximo cuatrienio.\nEntre ellos resaltó la apuesta del bilingüismo en las escuelas distritales, enseñanza de pensamiento integral . \"Barranquilla va a picar en punta y seremos los primeros en Latinoamérica\". En cuanto a la seguridad, señaló que trabajará de la mano con el gobernador Eduardo Verano para llegar con los recursos de la gobernación del Atlántico y garantizar el orden público en Barranquilla y su área metropolitana.\n\"Estamos armados hasta los dientes, aquí le vamos a dar candela. Los bandidos que vayan cogiendo para Paraguachón. Tenemos que desaparecer la extorsión de Barranquilla. Vamos a comprar un software que ayudará a saber dónde están ubicados los extorsionistas\", dijo Char.\nEntre otros de sus proyectos, también se refirió al trabajo que realizarán con los cuidadores de personas en condición de discapacidad y al mismo tiempo por las oportunidades de empleo para esta población.\n\"Me he preparado física y mentalmente, porque este es un compromiso muy grande. El reto es difícil, grande e importante, pero estamos más preparados que nunca para llevar a Barranquilla a otro nivel. Esta localidad del suroriente tiene un símbolo muy importante para los barranquilleros, nos ha dado muchas alegrías. Qué hace falta, suturar esta herida del arroyo de Rebolo de una vez por toda, que es un monumento a la inseguridad. Tenemos que morir en paz cumpliéndole a Barranquilla\", refiriéndose a la canalización del arroyo de ese importante sector, donde según recordó no había manera que la policía entrara, tampoco que entrara una ambulancia.\n\"Hemos hecho más de 3000 pavimentos nuevos, pero todavía falta. Algunos me dicen alcalde del cemento, pero anda a vivir sin pavimento a ver\", señaló el mandatario. Concluyó su intervención prometiendo la construcción de un malecón para el suroriente de la ciudad.\nCongresistas, autoridades policiales, el gobernador electo Eduardo Verano, Elsa Noguera, familiares y la comunidad de Rebolo acompañaron al alcalde en su acto de posesión.",

    "text": "DUNLAP — At Ox Bow Park Saturday, disc golf was the game, and reducing food insecurity was the target. Bryce Canen, Dunlap, took part in the disc golf tournament at the park, the Saturday portion of the Maple City Ice Bowl, and fundraiser for The Window in Goshen, the event having begun Friday with the annual Fire and Ice Festival beginning at noon Friday with ice carving downtown. “We’re all happy to be out here and help raise some money for The Window,” Canen said. Event Director Jason Samuel said that as of early afternoon the event was “phenomenal.” “This is the largest single disc golf tournament in the 33-year history of Ox Bow,” he said. The event course was made up of 54 holes, scattered around the park, with 108 players taking part, tossing and throwing discs into target baskets. “It’s just like golf, only better,” as Chris Berg of Osceola described it, as he started out on the the course shortly after lunch. Set up at Stable Shelter 7, the event also featured a raffle scheduled for later Saturday afternoon, as well as discs, sports towels, coaster and other items on display. Dressed warmly for the cold, players made their way around the course, many carrying disc golf basket carts along with them. Samuel, who is also a professor of communications at Goshen College, noted that people had come out to support The Window in Saturday’s cold, cloudy weather for a good cause. “We live in a great community,” he said, adding that The Window serves about 900 families each month, about 35 percent more than this time last year. “The fight against food insecurity is one of the most important issues today.” Donations are still being accepted for the event.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, United States -- Paolo Banchero and the Orlando Magic dominated late to overcome a heroic 50-point performance from Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell and beat the Cavaliers 103-96 on Friday (Saturday, Manila time,) forcing a decisive game seven in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.\nBanchero scored 10 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter for Orlando, drilling a three-pointer that put the Magic ahead for good with 3:39 left to play in a back-and-forth battle in which neither team could build a double-digit lead.\nFranz Wagner added 26 points for Orlando and Jalen Suggs made six three-pointers on the way to 22.\nOrlando, which had won games three and four at home by an average of 30.5 points, never looked like producing another blowout.\nBut with Banchero leading the way they had enough at the end to overcome Mitchell, who was clearly troubled by a nagging knee injury but had all 18 of the Cavs' fourth-quarter points.\nWith the series tied at three games apiece, the Cavs host game seven on Sunday. To advance to a second-round series against the Boston Celtics the Magic will have to do what neither team has done this series and win on the road.\nCleveland players, who made just one of 14 from three-point range, dominated the paint to keep it close.\nDown by four at halftime, the Cavs continued to attack the rim, authoring a 13-0 scoring run to take a 62-55 lead.\nMitchell briefly departed the court in the third quarter favoring his knee, but he returned to close the period with a floater at the buzzer that sent Cleveland into the fourth quarter with a 78-73 advantage.\nThe lead would change hands five times in the final period before Banchero broke a tie and the Magic pulled away.\nDarius Garland added 21 points for Cleveland, who were without center Jarrett Allen because of a rib contusion.\nFriday's other game saw the Dallas Mavericks, with a 3-2 series lead over the Los Angeles Clippers, trying to close out their Western Conference series at home.",

    "text": "As mercury drops, Gautam Budh Nagar orders schools to remain shut\nThe closure applies to all CBSE, ICSE, IB, UP Board and other recognized schools in the district and will remain effective until further notice, officials said. The decision comes as temperatures dipped, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting a minimum temperature of 7.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius on Thursday\nNOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has ordered the closure of all schools for classes nursery to 8, citing severe cold weather and dense fog in the region. The directive, issued by the District Basic Education Officer (DBEO) Rahul Pawar on Thursday, follows instructions from district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, Manish Kumar Verma.\nThe closure applies to all CBSE, ICSE, IB, UP Board and other recognized schools in the district and will remain effective until further notice, officials said. The decision comes as temperatures dipped, with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting a minimum temperature of 7.6 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius on Thursday.\n“In view of the severe cold and dense fog, all schools for classes nursery to 8 will remain closed until further notice. The safety and well-being of students are our top priorities,” said Pawar, adding, “The decision to close schools has been taken to ensure children are not exposed to harsh weather conditions. Parents and schools are advised to comply with the directive strictly.”\nIMD declared Thursday as a ‘cold day’ and has forecast similar conditions for the coming days. Dense fog is expected to persist on January 3 and 4, significantly reducing visibility and making morning travel unsafe for students.\n“Cold day conditions persisted across Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and western Uttar Pradesh. Light rainfall is expected in parts of Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi on January 6,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Meteorology and Climate Change at Skymet Weather.\n“The cold wave is likely to abate slightly following rain, but temperatures will remain below normal for a few more days due to cloud cover and northerly winds,” he added\nIn addition to the cold wave, light rain is predicted on January 6, and a generally cloudy sky. Daytime temperatures are expected to hover around 16-17 degrees Celsius, while night-time lows will range between 8-9 degrees Celsius, according to IMD data.\nThe education department has emphasised strict compliance with the orders, instructing all schools to follow the directive without exception.\nResidents of Gautam Budh Nagar have welcomed the move, citing the health and safety risks posed by the harsh weather conditions. “It is challenging for young children to brave such cold temperatures, especially during early morning school hours,” said a concerned parent in Noida.\nMeanwhile, students in higher classes have been advised to exercise caution while commuting, as dense fog significantly reduces visibility on roads. Schools have been urged to communicate any updates promptly to parents. The administration has assured that schools will reopen as soon as weather conditions improve.",
