    "text": "UTEP Women’s Basketball Loses Close Matchup to WKU, 65-59\nThe UTEP women's basketball team (9-10, 2-6 CUSA) lost to WKU (15-5, 6-2 CUSA) by a score of 65-59 on Thursday at the Don Haskins Center. Despite a comeback from a 13-point deficit to tie the game at 59, WKU closed the game with an 8-0 run. UTEP struggled with shooting, hitting 40.4% overall and only 23.8% from three-point range. Ivane Tensaie led the Miners with 18 points, while Luisa Vydrova and Dunja Zecevic each contributed 10 points. Coach Keitha Adams highlighted ongoing rebounding issues as a key reason for the loss.\nBy the Numbers- UTEP shot 40.4% (23-57) from the field and 23.8% (5-21) from three-point range.\n- WKU led the game with a 41.8% field goal percentage (23-55) and a dominant 78.9% from the free-throw line (15-19).\nDespite a closely contested match-up, UTEP's inability to secure crucial rebounds contributed to their downfall, particularly highlighted by giving up an offensive board in the final minutes when the game was tied.\nState of Play- WKU has now won five consecutive games, showcasing their strong performance in conference play.\n- UTEP continues to struggle, holding a record of 2-6 in CUSA, highlighting the challenges they're facing this season.\nUTEP will face Middle Tennessee on February 1 and then host rival NM State on February 8 for a key matchup in the Battle of I-10.\nBottom LineTo improve their chances in upcoming games, UTEP must address rebounding deficiencies and enhance shooting performances, especially from beyond the arc, to overcome competitive teams.\nRead more at UTEP Miners\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn. Heming also posted a vulnerable message to her [\"Die Hard\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/24/entertainment/peter-billingsley-die-hard-christmas/index.html) actor's [health issues](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/entertainment/bruce-willis-moonlighting-creator/index.html), sharing in the video that she \"was able to have a good cry\" with a close friend. \"It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do,\" Heming said in the video. In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",

    "title": "Why is Facebook photo quality so bad?",
    "text": "Why is Facebook Photo Quality so Bad?\nFacebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with over 2.7 billion monthly active users. However, despite its massive user base, Facebook has a reputation for poor photo quality. Whether it’s pixelated images, blurry faces, or awkward compression, Facebook’s photo rendering can be frustratingly subpar. So, what’s behind this problem?\nLack of Control Over Image Quality\nOne of the primary reasons for Facebook’s poor photo quality is the lack of control users have over image quality. When you upload a photo to Facebook, the platform’s algorithm automatically compresses the image to reduce file size and make it easier to share. However, this compression can result in a significant loss of image quality.\nFacebook’s Compression Algorithm\nFacebook uses a compression algorithm called WebP , which is designed to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable image quality. However, this algorithm can struggle with certain types of images, such as high-resolution photos or images with complex compositions. As a result, Facebook’s compression algorithm can often result in:\nLoss of detail : WebP’s compression can cause fine details, such as textures or patterns, to be lost or distorted.\nBlurriness : Compression can also cause images to become blurry or soft, especially in areas with high contrast.\nColor loss : WebP can also struggle with color accuracy, resulting in images with washed-out or unnatural colors.\nUpload Resolution\nAnother factor contributing to Facebook’s poor photo quality is the limited upload resolution. When you upload a photo to Facebook, it’s reduced to 2048 x 2048 pixels , regardless of its original resolution. This reduction can result in:\nLoss of resolution : If your original photo has a higher resolution than 2048 x 2048 pixels, Facebook will automatically downscale it, leading to a loss of detail.\nCompression artifacts : The downscaled image may also exhibit compression artifacts, such as blocky patterns or strange textures.\nThird-Party App Integration\nFacebook’s third-party app integration can also affect photo quality. When you use a third-party app to edit or enhance your photos, Facebook may not always support the edited file format. This can result in:\nFormat compatibility issues : If Facebook doesn’t support the edited file format, it may default to a lower-quality compression or scaling, leading to poor image quality.\nLoss of editing metadata : Some editing apps may store editing metadata, such as layers or filters, in the image file. Facebook may not support these metadata, resulting in a loss of editing details.\nConclusion\nFacebook’s poor photo quality is a result of a combination of factors, including its compression algorithm, limited upload resolution, and third-party app integration. While Facebook has made efforts to improve image quality, the platform’s limitations can still result in poor photo quality. As a user, it’s essential to understand these limitations and take steps to optimize your photos before uploading them to Facebook.\nTips for Optimizing Your Facebook Photos\nTo improve the quality of your Facebook photos, follow these tips:\nUse a high-quality camera : Use a high-quality camera or smartphone to take photos with high resolution and detail.\nEdit your photos before uploading : Edit your photos using a third-party app or photo editing software to enhance color, contrast, and resolution.\nSave as a supported format : Save your edited photos in a format supported by Facebook, such as JPEG or PNG.\nUse Facebook’s built-in editing tools : Use Facebook’s built-in editing tools, such as crop, rotate, and filters, to enhance your photos without compromising image quality.\nConsider using a photo-sharing service : Consider using a photo-sharing service, such as Google Photos or Flickr, which may offer higher-quality image rendering and more advanced editing features.\nComparison of Facebook Photo Quality with Other Social Media Platforms\nHere’s a comparison of Facebook photo quality with other popular social media platforms:\nPlatform\nMaximum Upload Resolution\nCompression Algorithm\nFacebook\n2048 x 2048 pixels\nWebP\nInstagram\n1080 x 1080 pixels\nInstagram’s proprietary algorithm\nTwitter\n2048 x 2048 pixels\nTwitter’s proprietary algorithm\nPinterest\n735 x 1102 pixels\nPinterest’s proprietary algorithm\nFlickr\nNo maximum upload resolution\nVarious formats supported\nAs you can see, Facebook’s photo quality is not the best, especially when compared to platforms like Instagram and Pinterest. However, by understanding the factors that affect photo quality and taking steps to optimize your photos, you can still achieve great results on Facebook.\nConclusion\nFacebook’s poor photo quality is a result of its compression algorithm, limited upload resolution, and third-party app integration. While the platform has its limitations, there are steps you can take to optimize your photos and achieve better results. By understanding the factors that affect photo quality and using Facebook’s built-in editing tools and third-party apps, you can create high-quality photos that showcase your best work.",

    "text": "News\nJohn praises NIB on cyber attack response\nClint Chan Tack\nUNC deputy political leader Jearlean John praised the National Insurance Board (NIB) for the manner in which it handled that a cyber attack on Wednesday.\nJohn also said the Opposition will keep an open mind with respect to cyber security legislation which Government plans to bring to Parliament.\nShe made these comments during the UNC's final news conference for the year on Thursday.\nIn two separate statements on Wednesday, the NIB announced that it experienced a cyber attack and had engaged local and foreign experts for help.\nThe NIB said that \"all steps are being taken to protect our data integrity and technology hardware.\"\nThe company added, \"We are also continuing to diligently work with our external technology partners expeditiously resolve this matter.\"\nThe NIB said it reported the incident to the National Security Ministry's TT Cyber Security Incident Response Team (TT-CSIRT) and is working with them toward a resolution.\nShe claimed the NIB's approach was better than than taken by the Telecommunications Sservices of TT (TSTT) two months earlier when it experienced a cyber attack.\n\"They (NIB) have been upfront and said they have been hacked.\"\nJohn said to date, no one knows what was the cause of the cyber attack on TSTT.\nSpeaking in the Senate on November 7, Public Utilities Minister Marvin Gonzales said Government had mandated TSTT's board to do a thorough and independent investigation.\nThe board, he continued, has taken steps towards facilitating the start of the probe.\nGonzales said, \" Additionally, TSTT is still in the process of evaluating all aspects of the attack, including the validation of all reported information in the public domain, that is the personal data of all our citizens, inclusive of members of the Cabinet and parliamentarians.\"\nThat exercise is being done on a customer-by-customer basis.\nAs the results of the investigation become available, Gonzales promised \"to provide further clarity on this ongoing situation to the national community.\"\nAsked whether the Opposition would support any proposed cyber security legislation that Government bring.\nto Parliament, John reiterated that the UNC will always support legislation that is in the country's best interest.\nIn the Senate on December 19, Attorney General Reginald Armour, SC, said laws to deal with cyber crime will be coming to Parliament soon.\nHe said his ministry is preparing \"a cyber crime legislative package that will replace the existing Computer Misuse Act.\"\nArmour said, \"The most notable legislative reforms include the advancement of computer-related crimes, seeking to protect against the involvement of our youth in this type of criminal activity and the need to streamline our laws with that of international legal advancements.\"\nHe said the legislative package that will replace the Computer Misuse Act will \"accommodate the robust criminalisation of cyber crimes through new advances of information and communication technologies.\"\nJohn said stronger legislation to thwart cyber criminals was just one part of the solution towards strengthening cyber security.\nShe suggested that public and private sector companies do regular reviews of their cyber security measures to ensure they are operating properly.\nJohn added that cyber criminals often target entities which they feel have vulnerabilities in their cyber systems.\nDuring a meeting of the Parliament's Social Services and Public Administration Committee meeting on December 11, its members were told about 200 cyber attacks on public and private sector entities over the last five years and no legislation to define these incidents as crimes and help the authorities bring the perpetrators to justice.\nThose testimonies came from members of TT-CSIRT and the police cyber and social media unit (CSMU).\nCSMU head Supt Amos Sylvester said while there have been many cyber incidents, there are no specific laws which identify them as crimes.\n\"We depend largely on legislation (to act against criminals).\"\nSylvester was unaware of anyone being charged for computer-related offences in the last three years.",

    "text": "夏日，西藏阿里地区普兰县巴嘎乡，塔尔钦旅游小镇一带很是热闹。\n冈仁波齐山脚下，游人络绎不绝，牦牛驮着行李走在路上，身上的铃铛叮当作响；玛旁雍错湖畔，游客们三五成群，欣赏着蓝宝石般的湖面。\n坐落在冈仁波齐与玛旁雍错之间，塔尔钦旅游小镇近年来依托独特的自然资源发展旅游，吸引八方游客。\n“你看这里的草和湖，多干净”\n阳光映照下，玛旁雍错湖面碧波万顷，湿地郁郁葱葱，牦牛悠闲地甩着尾巴。\n20岁的管护员古那桑珠熟悉这里的每一抹绿，作为一名生态管护员，他每天要花4个小时在湿地巡逻。\n古那桑珠的主要工作是和游客“讲道理”——发现游客有乱扔垃圾、开车碾压草地等不文明行为时，古那桑珠就上前制止，并将湿地保护理念讲给游客听，呼吁大家一起爱护环境。\n对于古那桑珠来说，最有成就感的事莫过于看着这里的生态环境持续好转。\n“之前，有不少人会乱扔垃圾。”他说，“现在，你看这里的草和湖，多干净！”\n在玛旁雍错湿地，一共有90名管护员。普兰县自然资源和林业草原局的工作人员李海容介绍，玛旁雍错湿地设有多个设备齐全的管护站，组建了专业管护队伍，负责管护这片“绿色海洋”。\n“管护员们不仅把保护这里的生态环境当作一份工作，也把这片湖水和湿地当作自己的家去爱护。”李海容说。\n“基础设施好了，游客多了”\n走进塔尔钦旅游小镇，咖啡馆、藏装体验馆、文创小店等商铺迎来送往，游客们笑语阵阵。\n一家咖啡馆门口摆放了一大排玩偶，吸引不少游客进店——店铺不仅卖咖啡，还售卖原创文创产品。“卖得最好的就是冰箱贴了，上面的图案都是我们自己设计的。”咖啡馆店主刘博介绍。\n近年来，当地基础设施持续完善。越来越多前往冈仁波齐一带观光的游客，选择在小镇驻足歇脚。\n“基础设施好了，游客多了，我们生意更好了。”说起小镇的变化，刘博很高兴。\n前几年，刘博推着咖啡车在景区附近流动售卖。去年，他听说在小镇开店有租金减免优惠，看着店铺优越的位置，他动了心，开了这家咖啡店。“小镇给我们提供了租金优惠，巴嘎乡政府的工作人员也经常来走访询问我们的需求，为我们提供服务保障。”刘博说。\n这些支持让刘博能够更安心地经营咖啡馆、设计文创产品。“我希望越来越多人知道我们这座小镇，来感受这里的魅力。”刘博说。\n“收入一年比一年多，让我们更加努力工作”\n牦牛驮着行李稳步向前，马背上的游客不时转头欣赏四周风光。冈仁波齐山脚下，牦牛运输队是一道特别的风景。\n塔尔钦旅游小镇所在的岗莎村，每年5月至9月，村民桑杰多吉会用牦牛和马匹为游客提供驮运行李、游览观光等服务，这是桑杰多吉的重要营生，“每月收入能有6000元。”\n岗莎村村委会主任平措益西介绍，1981年村民自发成立了牦牛运输队，1996年村里又以集体经济合作组织的形式对牦牛运输队进行整体运作。2018年，岗莎村成立了西藏岗仁布齐旅游服务有限公司，通过股份制规范管理，让“大头”收入装到村民口袋中。\n村民们在旅游淡季时放牧，旺季则通过参与牦牛运输队增收。一年两份收入，让村民们的钱包更鼓。\n2024年，西藏岗仁布齐旅游服务有限公司创收超2200万元。其中牦牛运输队创收超1270万元，为岗莎村1206名入股群众带来劳务收入约966万元、分红约181万元。\n“收入一年比一年多，让我们更加努力工作。我相信在党的好政策影响下，我们的生活会越来越好！”桑杰多吉说。",
