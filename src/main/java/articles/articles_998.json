    "title": "Lumentum (LITE) Stock Rises on Speed Benchmark and Guidance Update",
    "text": "Lumentum Holdings (LITE, Financial) witnessed a remarkable 5.08% stock price surge, reflecting investor optimism following the announcement of a strategic collaboration with Keysight Technologies aimed at addressing the burgeoning bandwidth demands of AI and machine learning applications. The duo achieved an innovative milestone, demonstrating optical technology with a speed of 448 gigabytes per second, set to be showcased at the annual Optical Fiber Communications Conference.\nLumentum Holdings Inc (LITE, Financial) is a prominent player in the optical and photonic products realm, providing solutions predominantly for telecommunications networking and commercial lasers. Despite the recent positive stock movement, the company exhibits several warning signs, such as a distressing Altman Z-Score of 1.01, indicative of potential financial struggles, including a possibility of bankruptcy in the next two years. Additionally, its Piotroski F-Score stands at a low 3, a signal of suboptimal business operations.\nOn the valuation front, Lumentum's GF Value suggests it is modestly overvalued, with a GF Value standing at $52.48. The stock currently trades at $66.82, showing a disconnect between market price and intrinsic value, with the GF Value Estimate for 12 months ahead at $68.95. Lumentum's price-to-book ratio is 5.29, surpassing the industry median of 3.24, alongside a price-to-sales ratio of 3.22, indicating a premium valuation in the market.\nDespite these valuation concerns, the company forecasts robust financial performance, with management revising their guidance to project $750 million in quarterly revenue and a 20% operating margin, buoyed by the imminent launch of next-generation optical and laser products. However, investors should remain cautious, considering the severe warning signs, including declining revenue per share and a long-term contraction in gross margins at an average of -6.8% per year.",

    "text": "Eclipse solar anular: Así fue el impresionante 'anillo de fuego' Un eclipse solar anular sorprendió a habitantes de países sudamericanos como Chile, Argentina y Uruguay. En el cielo pudo observarse el denominado 'anillo de fuego' Miles de personas quedaron fascinadas con el fenómeno astronómico que pudo ser visto en Sudamérica. El espectáculo celestial fue calificado de único: un eclipse solar anular que transformó al Sol en un impresionante 'anillo de fuego'. En Chile, Argentina y Uruguay, dejó a científicos y aficionados maravillados. ¿QUÉ ES UN ECLIPSE SOLAR? Un eclipse solar se produce cuando la Luna se posiciona directamente entre la Tierra y el Sol, bloqueando parcial o totalmente la luz solar que llega a nuestro planeta. La sombra de la Luna proyectada sobre la Tierra genera un oscurecimiento temporal en aquellas regiones donde cae esta sombra, justamente. ¿DÓNDE SE VIO EL ECLIPE PARCIAL DEL SOL? La trayectoria del eclipse comenzó en el Pacífico Sur, pasando por la Isla de Pascua y cruzando la Patagonia antes de finalizar en el Atlántico Sur. En su punto máximo, la Luna se interpuso entre la Tierra y el Sol, ocultando casi por completo al astro y dejando a la vista un anillo brillante de luz solar. En Chile, con los imponentes moáis como testigos, los habitantes de la Isla de Pascua y los visitantes de todo el mundo se reunieron para presenciar el espectáculo celestial. Mientras que, en Argentina, cientos de turistas, fotógrafos y entusiastas de la astronomía se reunieron en Puerto San Julián, en la Patagonia. Muchos describieron el momento como impresionante y renovador. En la capital uruguaya de Montevideo, las personas también pudieron disfrutar de un espectacular eclipse solar. Un espectáculo efímero, pero inolvidable. El anillo de fuego regaló un momento mágico que quedará grabado en la memoria de quienes lo presenciaron.",

    "text": "Private school parents fundraise to stop closure\nParents have launched a fundraiser in an attempt to save a private school in south-east London that is due to close at the end of the academic year.\nTwo weeks ago, Bishop Challoner School's Board of Trustees confirmed that the Catholic independent school for children aged three to 18 would close this summer.\nParents of students at the Bromley school said the announcement came as a shock, and have come together to launch a fundraiser with a target of £400,000 in a bid to keep the gates open.\nThe school cited the government's VAT hike and rising living costs as contributing factors for its closure, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nJust over a third of the student body at Bishop Challoner are pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND).\nStacey's five-year-old son Paddy is in his first year at the school. Stacey attended Bishop Challoner as a child, met his wife there, and his mother also worked there for a time and still does occasionally.\n\"It's like a 35-year connection,\" he said.\nStacey said his son was \"distraught\" and \"heartbroken\" after he found out his school was closing at the end of the year.\nHe said of the fundraiser: \"It's difficult because people have a perception of what Bishop Challoner might be. It's so different from an independent fee-paying school.\n\"Parents are sacrificing other things to send their kids to the school. It's a small independent school that just offers so much more.\"\nAt the school's 2024 inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, officers found that 94 of the school's 271 pupils had SEND.\nThere are concerns about how that many pupils will fit into alternative provision within the borough.\nOne parent, who did not want to be named, said her autistic son fell into a form of depression following the closure announcement.\nShe said Bishop Challoner helped her son become more socially confident after he developed \"incredibly debilitating anxiety\" following the Covid lockdowns.\n\"They're so patient with him and nothing is too much trouble for these staff. It's a beautiful, beautiful school,\" she said.\nFrom 1 January, 2025, private school fees in the UK are subject to a 20% VAT charge.\nThis change means that education and boarding services provided by private schools are no longer exempt from VAT, impacting both tuition fees and boarding costs.\nBishop Challoner has offered no further public comment since it announced its closure on 12 June.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
