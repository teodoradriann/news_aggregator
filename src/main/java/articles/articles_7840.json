    "text": "The Supreme Court has refused to entertain a plea by NGO National Federation of Indian Women alleging that retributive, communal and punitive demolitions by States like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan continue in contempt of the apex court’s stay order in September. A three-judge Bench headed by Justice B.R. Gavai took exception to the fact that the NGO was a third party which was neither directly nor indirectly affected by the demolitions. ALSO READ: Editorial on the Supreme Court and ‘bulldozer justice’ “Let those who have suffered by the demolitions come to us. You are a third party. We do not want to open a Pandora’s box by entertaining this at the instance of a third party,” Justice Gavai addressed advocate Nizam Pasha, who represented the NGO in court. Justice Gavai said the court would take care of it if somebody’s structure was pulled down by the State in spite of the court’s order staying illegal razing of private buildings . The court had called it the “bulldozer culture”. Ms. Pasha said the stay order in September had squarely applied to the demolitions in question as the razed buildings did not come within the ambit of any exemptions. The court had made it clear that its stay would not apply to unauthorised structures on public roads, streets, footpaths, those abutting railway lines or on public places like water bodies. The lawyer said many of those affected by the demolitions were unable to access courts. They were either in jail or their lives were dismantled by the demolitions. “Please do not say that. They can have their family members or even public-spirited persons from their neighbourhood come here… We will entertain if somebody genuinely concerned approaches us,” Justice Gavai responded. The court had frozen illegal bulldozer demolitions across the country while drawing attention to reports of “glorification, grandstanding and even justifications” about the razing of private homes and properties of undertrials and their immediate family members. The court had observed that authorities would not be permitted to bulldoze the laws of the land. The apex court has decided to frame guidelines against illegal demolitions by authorities.

    "text": "Eduardo Bolsonaro critica Nunes por apoio a Joice Hasselmann São Paulo\n15/08/2024 18h29\nO prefeito de São Paulo, Ricardo Nunes (MDB), foi criticado por Eduardo Bolsonaro (PL). O deputado não gostou do apoio de Nunes à candidatura de Joice Hasselmann (Podemos) à Câmara Municipal da capital paulista. O parlamentar acusou o prefeito de falhar nos acenos à direita, de não estabelecer diálogos sobre estratégias de campanha e, agora, de apoiar a \"maior traidora do bolsonarismo\".\n\"É inacreditável como Nunes cava a própria sepultura ao apoiar a maior traidora do bolsonarismo. Ele tem o apoio do PL, mas falha nos acenos, nessa tentativa de se posicionar ao centro. É nesse vácuo que Pablo Marçal (PRTB) tem crescido, por se alinhar com o eleitorado fiel aos nossos valores\", declarou Eduardo Bolsonaro.\nNunes foi visto em um vídeo publicado na terça-feira, 13, no qual chamava Hasselmann de \"nossa candidata a vereadora\".\nAlém de Eduardo Bolsonaro, seguidores também criticaram o apoio nos comentários e marcaram o perfil do deputado.\nNa publicação, Joice Hasselmann convoca os eleitores a se unirem contra Guilherme Boulos (PSOL), principal oponente de Nunes, segundo as pesquisas eleitorais. \"Agora é hora de todos se juntarem para formar um cinturão anti-Boulos em São Paulo. São Paulo merece mais!\", escreveu. Nunes afirmou que conversará sobre o assunto com Eduardo e que Joice é apenas uma das 600 vereadoras de sua coligação.\nJoice esteve afastada da política desde 2022, após ser derrotada e romper com o bolsonarismo em 2019. Desde então, a ex-líder do governo Bolsonaro na Câmara tornou-se uma adversária da extrema-direita.",

    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Roman Peplinski, of Kansas City, Mo., pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday for illegally taking fentanyl from a Lee’s Summit, Mo hospital, for his own personal use. Peplinski, 37, waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Greg Kays to federal information that charges him with one count of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud, forgery and deception.\nThe former anesthesiologist was employed at Union Hill Group. Peplinski worked at two University of Health hospitals, Lakewood Medical Center in Lee’s Summit and Truman Medical Center in Kansas City.\nPeplinski admitted that he illegally obtained fentanyl from Lakewood in Nov 2022. Peplinski misrepresented the fentanyl use for a patient, when in fact, that patient was discharged from the hospital earlier that day. Fentanyl was not listed under the “medication orders” on the patient’s chart for the hospital visit.\nPeplinski also admitted to withdrawing fentanyl from three vials from Sept. 1, 2022, through Nov. 30, 2022.\nOn Feb. 16, 2023, personnel from Lakewood reported to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that three vials of fentanyl in an automated dispensing cabinet showed signs of tampering. In March of 2023, seven vials of fentanyl that were suspected of being tampered with were sent to the FDA’s Forensic Chemistry Center where tests were performed on the vials and their contents. Of those seven vials, three showed evidence of being tampered with. One of those vials contained no fentanyl and the other two vials contained a small amount of fentanyl.\nThe government has no evidence that any patients were harmed as a result of Peplinski tampering with vials of fentanyl.\nUnder federal statutes, Peplinski is subject to a sentence of up to four years in federal prison without parole. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Mathieu Warnier, Media365, publié le jeudi 23 janvier 2025 à 23h30\nOyonnax a signé une cinquième victoire de rang lors de la réception de Brive en ouverture de la 18eme journée de Pro D2 (34-16).\nOyonnax ne s'arrête plus en Pro D2 ! Restant sur quatre victoires de rang, les joueurs de Joe El Abd avaient l'opportunité de poursuivre leur série lors de la réception de Brive. Contre une équipe en perte de vitesse, le club du Haut-Bugey n'a pas laissé passer l'occasion. Alors que Léo Carbonneau a vite cédé sa place à Maxime Sidobre après une blessure à l'épaule droite, il n'a fallu attendre que neuf minutes pour voir le Stade Charles-Mathon vibrer devant le premier essai du match signé Teddy Durand. Le talonneur d'Oyonnax a conclu en coin une bonne combinaison avec son demi de mêlée Jonathan Ruru. Malgré une position loin d'être évidente, cet essai a été transformé par Zack Holmes. Dans la foulée, Curwin Bosch a débloqué le compteur du CAB sur une pénalité plein axe située au milieu du terrain. Déchaînés, les Oyonnaxiens ont corsé l'addition au quart d'heure de jeu. A la suite d'un lancer en touche volé aux Brivistes, Adrien Bordenave est venu conclure victorieusement un surnombre pour son équipe, avant de céder sa place sur blessure à Oli Kebble. Là-encore, Zack Holmes n'a pas tremblé face aux perches sur la transformation.\nBrive trop indiscipliné Mais le tournant du match a eu lieu à la 20eme minute quand, après un plaquage dangereux sur Loïc Godener, le deuxième-ligne de Brive Tevita Ratuva a écopé d'un carton rouge. Dans la foulée, le troisième-ligne d'Oyonnax a dû répondre au protocole commotion, sans pouvoir reprendre le jeu. Malgré cette infériorité numérique, le club corrézien a ajouté trois points par la botte de Curwin Bosch à unq quart d'heure de la pause. Ce à quoi son vis-à-vis Zack Holmes a répondu dans la minute suivante. Le buteur australien a récidivé sur la sirène pour permettre à son équipe de retrouver son vestiaire avec quatorze points d'avance. Dès la reprise, Pierre-Henry Broncan a lancé du sang frais en espérant une révolte sur une pelouse de plus en plus envahie par le brouillard. Une pression sur les joueurs d'Oyonnax qui s'est matérialisé par un carton jaune pour Ewan Johnson. Le deuxième-ligne a payé l'indiscipline de ses coéquipiers. Revenus au même nombre de joueurs pour dix minutes, les Brivistes ont même basculé en supériorité numérique quand Christophe Vaotoa a également écopé d'un carton jaune. Dans la foulée, le CAB a trouvé la faille avec Paul Pimienta qui est allé à dame, aplatissant au pied des perches.\nOyonnax assure le bonus offensif Curwin Bosch a passé la transformation pour ramener les Corréziens à neuf points. Et même six unités à l'heure de jeu grâce à une pénalité. Sauf que l'équipe briviste est alors restée muette face à des Oyonnaxiens bien décidés à aller chercher une victoire bonifiée. Pour cela, il leur fallait deux essais. Le premier est arrivé à un quart d'heure de la sirène, quand Maxime Salles a profité d'un bon mouvement de Jonathan Ruru pour aplatir en coin avec Zack Holmes qui a passé la transformation. A l'approche des dix dernières minutes, Brive a perdu Issam Hamel. Le talonneur a reçu un carton jaune pour un plaquage dangereux. Une double supériorité numérique qui a facilité la vie des joueurs d'Oyonnax avec Benjamin Geledan qui est allé chercher le bonus offensif avec un essai en force au terme d'un ballon porté rondement mené. La transformation signée Zack Holmes a scellé le sort de la rencontre, achevée dans des conditions de visibilité très restreintes en raison d'un brouillard qui s'est épaissi au fil du second acte. Oyonnax signe ainsi une cinquième victoire de rang (34-16) et remonte provisoirement au septième rang du classement de Pro D2. Brive, pour sa part, chute pour la troisième fois de rang et pourrait perdre du terrain dans la hiérarchie.",

Les partis arabes évoquent une nouvelle provocation du suprémaciste Ben Gvir, selon RFI. Un commentateur souligne que c’est lui le véritable Premier ministre. Il pense que le rêve du Hamas va se réaliser : les Palestiniens de tous bords vont s’unir. Selon Haaretz, une farce politique pourrait se transformer en tragédie. D’après la proposition du ministre extrémiste, seuls les Palestiniens de plus de 70 ans auront la permission de se rendre au troisième lieu saint de l’Islam. Les batailles des forces de Résistance contre les agressions du régime sioniste auront un impact immédiat sur le mois sacré du Ramadan, qui débute le 10 mars.

Que mañana baje Dios y pare la guerra con sus poderes es más realista que eso que propones.\n[#15](c15#c-15) En esos argumentos hay muchísimo de propaganda rusa. Antes de la llegada de los hombrecitos verdes en 2014 al Dombas, está era una zona tranquila sin mayores ansias independentistas de las que pudiera tener el país vasco.\nEl problema es que de repente apareció todo un ejército en estas regiones totalmente agresivo y expansionista. Solo hay que ver el avión de pasajeros derribado con armamento especializado.\nPor poner un caso 100% documentado: el tribunal holandés que juzgo el asesinato de los 300 pasajeros determinó que de los 4 responsables directos, 3 fueron oficiales rusos y solo un ucraniano independentista. Y que el lanzamisiles es propiedad ruso, y fue trasladado inmediatamente a Moscú tras el atentado.\nYo no sé cómo hay gente que se traga la propaganda habiendo tanta información contrastada. Y no sólo eso; a estas alturas este proceder de acudir en \"auxilio\" de las minorías rusas, meter mercenarios o soldados encubiertos, tomar la zona responsabilizando a los independentistas, ya se había repetido en Georgia o Moldavia anteriormente.\n[#71](c71#c-71) ”sin intentar engañar a los demás con las causas del conflicto”.\n¿Estás insinuando que Ucrania es responsable de que Rusia pretenda robarle los tres oblast que son con diferencia la mayor fuente de riqueza del país?\n¿Te has preguntado por qué Rusia no va a por las capitales (Kiev u Odessa)? ¿Por qué invade solamente las regiones que generan más dinero y se la suda todo el resto de Ucrania, que es rural?\nEl único engañado con las causas del conflicto eres tú, que no ves que esto es un atraco y nada más. Es el robo descarado de las fuentes de riqueza de un país, a manos de un matón extranjero. Ucrania no puede rendirse si no quiere morir de hambruna al día siguiente.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No, no es como si España entrara en guerra con USA. Es como si USA invadiera España para robarla.\nY por lo visto tú abogarías por regalarle al invasor todas las regiones industrializadas y toda la costa turística del país (que son los territorios que ha tomado Rusia en Ucrania). Como si eso no supusiera directamente la muerte de tu país.\nPor cierto, ¿en qué cabeza seca ”que muera gente” es responsabilidad del invadido y no del invasor?\n[#60](c60#c-60) Los ucranianos se rindieron hace dos años.\nOtra cosa es el que nazi hijo de la gran puta de su presidente y los países corruptos que le ceban de armas para que siga masacrando a su población y así pueda lucrarse el hijo de puta de Biden y todos los hijos de puta que tienen acciones en la industria armamentística que se están forrando en EEUU, así como todos los hijos de la gran puta que dirigen Europa, desde la puta psicópata Bonder Leyen al hijo de la gran puta de Pedro mierda, pasando por la manga de hijos de puta corruptos que están sentados en el parlamento europeo, que siguen animando al pueblo ucraniano a defender su honor y toda esa basura de discurso.\nEl pueblo ucraniano se caga en la puta madre de toda está escoria que se está forrando a costa de sus vidas\nEllos se han rendido hace mucho. Pero no les dejan irse a su casa.\n[#5](c5#c-5) No está pidiendo la paz. Está pidiendo la rendición del agredido, en lugar de la retirada del agresor.\nEso de pacífico no tiene una mierda.",
