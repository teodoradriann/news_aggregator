    "text": "Trumpeter swans are majestic creatures, admired for their graceful presence and impressive size. They hold the distinction of being the largest species of aquatic bird globally and are the heaviest bird native to North America. Trumpeter swans are not only an awe-inspiring sight, but also a symbol of the wild beauty and biodiversity of the continent. Therefore, ensuring that their journey of recovery continues without depletion is crucial to preserving this iconic species.\nBy the late 19th century, trumpeter swans had vanished from Eastern Canada due to relentless hunting and habitat loss. Their disappearance marked a sombre chapter in the region’s natural history. However, in the mid-1980s, a dedicated conservation effort brought these magnificent birds back to Ontario, where they have since flourished. No longer listed as endangered, trumpeter swans are now protected under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act.\n×\nAlready a Subscriber?

Their presence signifies a thriving, diverse environment, and Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG) is proud that its conservation efforts have led to such a habitat, resulting in trumpeter swans nesting on its property.\nHowever, despite their success in population growth, individual trumpeter swans still face threats, many of which are human-induced. RBG pleads with its visitors to help safeguard these birds, asking them to avoid three critical behaviours:\nFirst, people should not approach nests or young swans. When in natural areas, it’s essential for visitors to keep their dogs on leash and remain on designated trails to minimize disturbances. This year, a pair of trumpeter swans nested on the lower Grindstone Creek in Royal Botanical Gardens’ Hendrie Park. Unfortunately, thoughtless trail users have harassed these birds, leading to the loss of a baby swan. Second, people should not feed trumpeter swans. Many well-meaning individuals offer food, such as bread, to wildlife, but this can cause severe nutritional problems. For trumpeter swans, excessive carbohydrate intake can lead to a condition called “angel wing,” a permanent disability that impairs their ability to fly. It’s crucial to let these birds forage naturally to maintain their health. Both RBG and the City of Burlington have a strict policy prohibiting the feeding of wildlife, with enforcement regulated by the City of Burlington’s bylaw enforcement department. If you witness wildlife feeding, please report it to Burlington’s bylaw enforcement. Third, people fishing should be mindful of their location, as it poses significant risks to nearby trumpeter swans. Barbed hooks can be fatal if ingested, and lead fishing weights are toxic. Additionally, discarded fishing line can entangle or be ingested by wildlife, potentially causing injury or death. It is recommended to use less-harmful alternatives, such as lead-free weights and barbless hooks. By respecting these guidelines and supporting conservation efforts, visitors can contribute to creating a safe and nurturing environment for trumpeter swans and other wildlife within our community. Together, we can ensure these majestic birds continue to thrive for generations to come.\nDavid Galbraith is director of science at Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG). RBG is a leading environmental organization in our community. More information is available at RBG.ca .",

    "text": "Thursday, June 27th 2024, 5:25 pm The State Board of Education is requiring all schools to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for students starting in the 5th grade. State superintendent Ryan Walters said this will require every teacher and classroom to keep the Bible inside, but some lawmakers have already criticized the decision. Related: [State Superintendent Walters Issues Memo To Require Bibles In Every Oklahoma Classroom](https://www.newson6.com/story/667d9b53db56cfabce241658/state-superintendent-walters-issues-memo-to-require-bibles-in-every-oklahoma-classroom) Walters said the Bible is a historical document that set the foundation for many events in U.S. history. Two state representatives, including John Waldron from Tulsa, said schools need to review existing state laws. Walters said his staff has been reviewing state statutes and academic standards and they think the Bible is a necessary document to teach kids. He said every teacher and every classroom in the state will have a Bible, and the state board will provide teaching materials so the same thing is being taught in every classroom. Walters said it is essential for students to have an understanding of the Bible and the historical context it carries. \"We see multiple figures, whether we're talking about the Federalist Papers, Constitutional Convention arguments, and Martin Luther King Junior, who used it as a tremendous impetus for the Civil Rights movement, and tying many of those arguments back to the Bible,\" State Supt. Ryan Walters said. Waldron said it part, \"Religious instruction should begin with and remain in the rightful hands of parents and guardians. Today's directive feels like an unprecedented attempt from the State Superintendent to distract from the reported investigations into financial mismanagement of tax dollars.\" The policy is expected to face almost immediate legal challenges.

    "title": "Bold adaptation of Chekhov's 'Three Sisters' is set amid the Biafran War — and there's drama aplenty",
    "text": "Three Sisters\n3.5 stars (out of 4)\nBy Inua Ellams, after Chekhov, directed by Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu. Until March 24 at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, 50 Tank House Lane.\nsoulpepper.ca or 416-866-8666\nOne of the criticisms often levelled against the plays of Anton Chekhov is that there’s not much plot or action in them. Even fellow Russian Leo Tolstoy threw up his arms and stated, “Where’s the drama?”\nThe older author would likely have no such issue with the bold adaptation of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” that just opened at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, in a co-production between Soulpepper and Obsidian Theatre Company.\nThere’s drama aplenty. And with its backdrop of the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, of 1967 to 1970, this version of the play could arguably be subtitled “War and Peace.”\nNigerian-born, UK-based writer Inua Ellams has shifted the setting from 19th century provincial Russia to the village of Owerri, Nigeria. Instead of longing to return to Moscow, where they grew up, Ellams’ three sisters want to travel back to cosmopolitan Lagos.\nEldest Lolo (Akosua Amo-Adem) is an unmarried, hard-working teacher in the local school; middle sister Nne Chukwu (Virgilia Griffith) is married to the school master, Onyinyechukwu (Tawiah M’Carthy); and youngest, Udo (Makambe K. Simamba), has just turned 20 and is being courted by two soldiers, the idealistic Nmeri Ora (Ngabo Nabea) and the odd, loose canon Igwe (Amaka Umeh).\nYou might be interested in\nThe three sisters — and their underachieving, Cambridge-educated brother, Dimgba (Toni Ofori) — have been living in Owerri for 11 years. Their father, a respected commander of the local brigade, built the house from scratch and wanted to immerse his family in their Igbo traditions, away from the influence of what he called “colonial cultural erosion.”\nWhen the play starts, he’s been dead a year. And as the family attempts to celebrate Udo’s birthday, they can’t help but think back to earlier, more extravagant celebrations.\nWhat they don’t know is that their world is about to go through some big changes involving the country’s neo-colonialist federal government and the Biafran state that emerged after it declared its independence from Nigeria in 1967. Soon they’re going to have bigger issues to deal with than sparsely-attended birthday parties and not being able to get the latest issue of “Lagos Life.”\nThe historical context adds fascinating layers to the material. For one thing, Nne Chukwu’s unhappy union with Onyinyechukwu is the result of an arranged teenage marriage, which explains why she’s attracted to the commander Ikemba (Daren A. Herbert). The siblings’ elderly family friend, Eze (Sterling Jarvis), was trained as a physician, but under British colonial rule couldn’t practice because he was Black, so he spends his days gambling and drinking. The domestic Oyiridiya (JD Leslie), the niece of their maid Nma (Ordena Stephens-Thompson), is a refugee from up north who saw her husband killed by Hausas and wants to exact revenge.\nOne of the key sources of conflict in the play — the three sisters’ dislike of their brother’s girlfriend, who later becomes his wife, here named Abosede (Oyin Oladejo) — is explained by the fact that she comes from the Yoruba tribe.\nWhat this means, however, is that Ellams needs to provide lots of information about the country’s political conflicts and theories about how they arose. Most of this comes through Amo-Adem’s school teacher, who’s disappointed that her brother-in-law, Onyinyechukwu, isn’t as informed as she is. And because of his interest in the state of the country, the young soldier Nmeri Ora emerges as a more distinctive figure than he often does in Chekhov’s original.\nAll of this adds to the play’s lengthy running time of three hours and 20 minutes. It also means that some of the key relationships seem diminished. The growing attraction between Nne Chukwu and Ikemba, for instance, feels less compelling than it does in a more traditional production of the play, especially when we watch it against a backdrop of starvation and death.\nDirector Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu ensures this massive play hits home. Joanna Yu’s set design suggests a modest dwelling with African details that must have been important to the siblings’ father. Ming Wong’s costumes and hair styles tell us as much about the characters’ status and class as Ellams’ dialogue. I especially liked how Onyinyechukwu’s dull, boxy suits show us what he thinks of himself.\nJohn Gzowski’s sound design and compositions help establish mood, whether we’re listening to a rumbling storm about to hit, the detonation of explosives nearby or a moment of nationalistic pride as the actors sing a traditional number.\nIt’s hard to imagine a stronger cast than the one Otu’s assembled. Each character is so well drawn that in the first scene alone the actors’ posture communicates their approach to life: Amo-Adem exhausted, Griffiths slyly awaiting some distraction, Simamba hopefully optimistic.\nCasting the genderfluid Umeh as the soldier Igwe was a clever move; besides bringing much-needed comic relief to the production, they revel in playing a socially awkward, unpredictable suitor. Oladejo’s Abosede goes through the most radical change, beginning as an insecure outsider dressed in mismatched clothes and ending up a ruthless, calculating woman in brutal charge of the household. Jarvis, Stephens-Thompson and Leslie bring their supporting roles to vivid life.\nKeep in mind that this production can be challenging to sit through, especially as it deals with a history that’s not the most familiar (novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie dealt with it in her 2006 novel “Half of a Yellow Sun”).\nBut the political dynamics that we see play out here — all ultimately motivated by greed and profit — regularly happen all over the world. And Chekhov’s themes of longing for the fabled past are, of course, universal.",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.
