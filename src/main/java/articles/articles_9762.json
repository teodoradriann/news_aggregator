    "title": "Liam Payne Came ‘Close to Death’ Several Times Due to His Drug Usage, Claims Friend",
    "text": "[Music News](../)\nLiam Payne Came ‘Close to Death’ Several Times Due to His Drug Usage, Claims Friend\n[Liam Payne](//www.rollingstone.com/t/liam-payne/)’s drug usage brought him “close to [death](//www.rollingstone.com/t/death/)” multiple times months before his [fatal fall](//www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-payne-cause-of-death-multiple-traumas-bleeding-from-fall-1235136202/) in October, according to his friend Roger Nores.\nIn a 91-page filing obtained by Rolling Stone Thursday, Nores — who is accused of abandonment followed by death — described the alleged depth of Payne’s drug abuse, which he claims led to several hospitalizations, multiple rehab center visits, and two resuscitations in just the last two years.\nLast week, a judge called for an “indagatoria,” which requires suspects in a case to be questioned as part of the investigation. Suspects are not required to respond to questioning, and can submit written responses, as Nores did Wednesday. It is not a deposition. The document — which includes Nores’ version of events, and screenshots of conversations with people close to the former One Direction member — was filed by Nores to support his defense to the charge of abandonment of a person, followed by death.\n“I was a friend who loved him very much, who helped him selflessly in everything I could, who spent my own money to help him, and even then it was not enough,” writes Nores in Spanish in the document obtained by Rolling Stone. “I do not consider that I deserve the accusation that is being leveled at me.”\nIn the filing, Nores claims that Payne was in and out of rehabilitation centers in Europe and the United States in the months leading up to his death, that he consumed heroin, and that his usage of substances nearly killed him several times.\nIn one instance, in September 2023, Nores alleges that Payne “suffered from a severe intoxication that left him close to death,” and that he was hospitalized for three days in Milan. He claims that at the time, Payne was forced to cancel a Latin American tour because of the incident and his subsequent visit to a rehab center. (Payne had canceled the tour that August due to a “[bad kidney infection](//www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/25/liam-payne-postpones-tour-one-direction-latin-america).”)\n“Because of his addictions, Payne continued to attend rehab centers of his own free will in an attempt to overcome them,” the statement contends. “Unfortunately, these treatments were not successful and his addiction worsened as he began to use harder drugs, such as heroin.”\nNores claims that Payne was hospitalized twice again in London in late 2023, and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance due to his “high levels of intoxication,” where he had to be resuscitated. “Professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life, without his family or friends being able to do anything to avoid these situations or help him,” Nores alleges.\nNores claims that Payne’s drug issues continued to worsen at the beginning of 2024, and that Payne entered a rehabilitation facility in Spain in March. Payne left the rehab center before completing treatment and returned to consuming drugs, Nores claims. Payne then allegedly had to be resuscitated again following a near overdose the following month.\n“Liam suffered a new relapse in his addiction, so he was again taken to the hospital in serious condition, and the professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life,” Nores claims. He further alleges that after this incident, Payne’s father attempted to admit him to a psychiatric treatment center, but that Payne opposed the idea.\nSince he was not legally required to stay there, Payne checked himself out of the hospital and returned to the United States to seek help for his drug addiction, Nores claims. The filing contends that Payne’s family and friends allowed him to do drugs the day before he left for the States to “avoid that he become violent.” (The document does not specify the exact timeline of his return to the United States.)\nNores maintains that Payne did not consume drugs that summer, including during a trip to Argentina when Payne went to a Louis Tomlinson show in South America. However, by the start of August, Nores claims that he and Payne had a “strong argument” where he discouraged Payne from returning to Manchester, England, because Nores could tell that Payne had started using drugs again.\nIn an Aug. 23 email obtained by Rolling Stone, Nores writes to Payne’s attorney and father Geoff that he is “really concerned for his well-being” in the United Kingdom. “I hope you can bring professional doctors to check on his health regularly as soon as possible as I did while he was out in the US,” Nores wrote. “I am going to stay fully out of the picture and disconnected from now on and I wish you all the best with Liam’s health and career.”\nReps for Payne’s family in Argentina and the United Kingdom did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment on Nores’ filing. Nores did not comment.\nNores’ “abandonment followed by death” charge accuses him of leaving Payne while knowing that he was unable to care for himself and/or that he wasn’t in his right mind. For said charge, Nores could face five to 15 years in prison. In Wednesday’s filing, Nores maintains that he was not his doctor, lawyer, or representative, and claims that when he left Payne at the hotel the day he died, he was “greeting fans” and seemed to be fine. (He[ told TMZ ](//amp.tmz.com/2024/12/14/liam-payne-friend-playful-happy-before-death/)that he was “playful” and in “good spirits.”)\nIn the document, Nores pivots blame to the hotel staff for carrying Payne’s body to his room where there was more of a risk of death. According to a 911 call, the reception head claimed the musician had been “breaking everything in his room” prior to the fatal fall. “If Liam had not been brought into the room by force, and had been left in the lobby and a doctor had been called while they saw him convulsing, none of this would have happened,” reads the filing.\nAlong with Nores, the other four people charged in the case responded to indagatorias. Next, the judge must determine whether the defendants should be further prosecuted, dropped from the case, or if there isn’t evidentiary support for either decision.\n[Payne died at the age of 31](//www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-payne-dead-at-31-one-direction-member-1235135586/) of multiple traumas and internal bleeding after falling from the third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Palermo hotel[ on Oct. 16](//www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-payne-dead-at-31-one-direction-member-1235135586/).

Many questions still loom about what led to his death.\nOn Saturday, Payne’s [fans held a march](//www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-payne-fans-argentina-march-justice-death-investigation-1235207584/) in Buenos Aires calling for significant and timely advances in the investigation. The gathering spawned after an image leaked online, which appeared to show Payne being carried by three hotel workers back to his room, allegedly mere minutes before he fell.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](/news/us-news)\n[Source link](//www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-payne-investigation-came-close-to-death-drug-use-friend-claims-1235212190/)",

    "text": "Abdel Rhman Silmi, a Gaza resident, seeks global support to rebuild life amidst ongoing conflict EINPresswire.com / -- Abdel Rhman Silmi , a devoted family man and former administrator at the renowned LC Waikiki Mall , is reaching out to the global community for support amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza City. Silmi, his wife, their two-year-old daughter Layan, and their seven-month-old son Ahmed have found themselves displaced for the fourth time as their home has been reduced to rubble by the relentless war. The conflict has left them homeless and jobless, with no income for the past five agonizing months. “The images attached bear witness to the destruction that has befallen us. They depict the ruins of my workplace and our home. Words fall short in conveying the extent of our loss,” says Silmi. The war, showing no mercy, has stretched on for over 200 days. With each passing day, their resources deplete further, and the birth of their son has only amplified their desperate need for aid. Silmi and his family have launched a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe with a goal to cover the high cost of living under war conditions until they can travel to Egypt, the cost of leaving Gaza and traveling to Egypt, passports, transportation and other travel-related expenses, replacing their lost belongings, renting an apartment in Egypt for at least five months, living expenses in Egypt until they can return to Gaza after the war, and repairing their destroyed home upon their return to Gaza after the war. “We humbly ask for support in our hour of need. Generous donations will not only help us rebuild our home but also ensure the provision of basic necessities for my family,” pleads Silmi. “Every contribution, no matter how small, carries immense weight in our struggle to reclaim what was lost.” From the depths of their hearts, the Silmi family thanks all for standing with them during this dire time.

    "title": "A plastics treaty could ease pollution by funding waste management | Grist",
    "text": "If all goes according to plan, by the end of the year, some 170 countries will finalize the world’s first legally binding treaty to curtail plastic pollution . Its success will depend in no small part on money: creating a funding pipeline so that signatories, especially in the Global South, can execute the promises they agree to.\nFor the moment, the specifics of this financing remain bound up in diplomatic haggling . Still, countries broadly agree that billions of dollars are a necessary, if modest, starting point; modeling studies have pegged the need anywhere between $3 trillion and $17 trillion. Disagreements center on how to raise it, who should administer it, and what to spend it on.\nBut these differences are unlikely to sink a treaty whose urgency has never been more apparent to national leaders. Each year some 20 million metric tons of plastic, roughly the mass of 200 aircraft carriers, enter the environment. Microscopic shreds of the stuff are increasingly found not just in nature’s remotest reaches, including Mount Everest and the Mariana Trench, but throughout the human body, with unknown consequences. And with production of this petrochemical-derived material set to skyrocket – possibly tripling by 2060 – plastic pollution and climate action are increasingly considered joined at the hip.\nWhatever form the treaty takes, it’s likely to prioritize one popular line item: expanding waste management, like trash systems and recycling, in the Global South. A good place to start addressing the problem, the thinking goes, is to get it out of nature and into landfills and recycling plants. Worldwide, 2.7 billion people live without regular refuse collection. As garbage volumes surge across the developing world, growing quantities of degrading plastic litter filter into rivers, lakes, and oceans.\nThis has put the spotlight on waste management as a low-tech, politically palatable way to curtail plastic pollution. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, which represents 38 industrial countries, says a comprehensive package of measures – tackling plastic’s whole lifespan, from production to disposal – could eliminate 95 percent of the pollution by 2040. Such steps include taxing plastic, banning some single-use items, and redesigning goods so they don’t have to be thrown in the trash. But it also called a $2.1 trillion expansion of old-fashioned waste infrastructure, like landfills, recycling plants, and the logistics systems that supply them, a “crucial prerequisite.” To meet the goals, it estimated, the world must recycle about 40 percent of its plastic. Today it recycles about 9 percent.\nA key target is Southeast Asia, where roughly a third of all marine plastic originates. There are several reasons for this. Rising living standards have boosted consumption of consumer goods, like soft drinks and takeout meals, packaged in single-use plastic. Europe, Japan and the USA continue to offload hundreds of millions of tons of plastic waste to the region each year, not all of it legally . With many population centers near coastlines and waterways, any mismanaged waste gets a free ride to the sea.\nThe governments of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have not invested nearly enough to fix this, mostly because they cannot afford to. Landfills, garbage trucks and recycling systems cost a lot, but aren’t very profitable. For cash-strapped governments facing multiple crises – pandemics, climate disasters, poverty – building even basic waste infrastructure can quickly fall by the wayside. Many of the 670 million people who live in the association’s member states have no one to take their trash.\nPeople in boats collect plastic from the heavily polluted Citarum River at Batujajar in Bandung, West Java, on June 12. Timur Matahair / AFP “So what do you do when it’s not collected?”, said Umesh Madhavan, research director at The Circulate Initiative, a nonprofit focused on ocean plastic pollution and the circular economy. “You dump it or dig a pit and bury it. Or you try and burn it.”\nThat is a common outcome for much of the refuse in Southeast Asia, where by one estimate, only about a third of waste gets any form of management – like landfills, recycling plants or incinerators. The number is closer to 100 percent in the U.S. and other wealthy nations.\nFor that reason, research suggests, basic waste management can bring outsize benefits. Last year a study by data scientists at the University of California at Santa Barbara identified five relatively simple and straightforward actions that could go a long way towards eliminating 89 percent of mismanaged plastic globally; improving trash and recycling systems were among them. In the OECD’s most ambitious scenario – which envisions a 95 percent reduction in plastic leakage by 2040 – these types of measures deliver three-quarters of the drop.\n“Downstream” solutions – that is, addressing plastic at the end of its life – will find supporters in Southeast Asia, where the governments of Malaysia and the Philippines have joined domestic petrochemical and manufacturing interests to promote “waste-to-energy” and “co-processing” plants as solutions to clear backlogged waste. These operations, which burn plastic to generate electricity or produce cement, are common in rich countries. But ASEAN environmentalists call them “false solutions” that release noxious and planet-warming pollutants while failing to tackle the root issues of the plastic crisis.\nSome scientists and environmentalists in the developing world say a treaty centered on waste management is bound to fail. They say experience shows no number of landfills or recycling plants can contend with the volume of plastic they’re seeing.\n“Nobody is talking about the production side of things. We’re just talking about how we can deal with the waste,” said Hema Mahadevan, a public engagement campaigner for Greenpeace Malaysia. “If you really want to cut down on plastic waste, then you should really start from the top. Go to the source of the problem.”\nJorge Emmanuel, a Filipino chemical engineer and former technical advisor for the United Nations Development Programme, said the Philippines’ waste systems are broken in ways infrastructure can’t fix. A 2023 study found it has the world’s highest per-capita rate of plastic released to the ocean, at about 7 pounds a year. Emmanuel said the country has tough laws supporting recycling and prohibiting illegal dumps, but officials don’t enforce them. That’s why he and others are urging treaty writers to invert how they think about waste: Focus on reducing the amount of plastic in the system, with waste management as a last resort.\n“I’m in public health, and we say prevention is better than cure,” he said. “If you put money into preventing the problem, you’ll spend less to take care of the problem afterwards.”\nHe and others with extensive first-hand experience with the region’s plastic pollution have a few suggestions for those crafting the treaty. The first is to direct money and supportive policies toward entrepreneurial solutions.\nSoutheast Asia, for instance, has in recent years seen a blossoming of projects and small-scale enterprises that hint at what a low-plastic economy might look like. On the Vietnamese resort island of Phu Quoc, a startup called Greenjoy has persuaded local businesses to replace 1 million plastic straws with those made of lepironia, a local grass.\nAn initiative in the Philippines has equipped 1200 sari-sari stores, the local equivalent of bodegas or corner stores, to dispense liquid detergent, dishwashing soap, and fabric conditioner in bulk to customers who bring their own containers. The products are made by local manufacturers rather than global corporations, and they’re cheaper. The project directors claim this has replaced thousands of thin plastic packages called sachets that are virtually impossible to recycle.\nMembers of Greenpeace Indonesia stage a protest against the plastic waste generated by Unilever’s products outside the company’s office in Tangerang, a suburb of Jakarta, on June 20. Yasuyoshi Chiba / AFP But such efforts have struggled to scale, often for lack of money. Businesses tackling plastic pollution often fall into a “missing middle” where they’re too big to receive microfinance, venture or philanthropic funding, but too risky for bank loans, said Madhavan. He and others said this financing gap could be plugged with funding from the plastic treaty, or by cash from corporations that need to comply with regulations.\nNew financing tools could help. In January the World Bank launched an experimental bond that will raise $14 million to help community-recycling projects in Indonesia and Ghana expand. The more plastic these projects collect, the more money the bond’s investors will make.\nBut novel financial methods can bring novel problems. The World Bank-funded projects will make money in part by selling plastic credits, a relatively young instrument of questioned effectiveness . They work something like carbon credits. A local project gathers plastic litter, disposes it properly, and a government, corporation, or other entity that wants credit for that cleanup pays the project for what it collected. Advocates say this can offer a quick injection of capital into developing countries with overwhelmed waste systems. Verra, the world’s biggest issuer of carbon credits, and companies like it are urging plastic-treaty negotiators to help this new tool scale up.\nEnvironmentalists blast this idea, saying the credits are too easy to game for projects of dubious environmental value, like co-processing. Even if such credits incentivize local junk cleanups, they argue, they’re not enough to remake a system that pours so much plastic on developing countries in the first place.\nA global plastic fund also could mobilize the world’s largest recycling workforce. Most of the world’s plastic recycling is not done by municipalities or corporations, but people who salvage things from the trash as a livelihood. There are some 20 million waste pickers in the world, mostly in the Global South; together their efforts account for 60 percent of the plastic recycled on earth.\nIndumathi, a woman in Bengaluru, India, began waste picking about two decades ago after falling into medical debt. She started out going street to street, but as the years passed she wondered how to make this low-margin business safer and more profitable for herself. She saved enough money to open her own scrap shop. She helped convince the city to give waste pickers identification cards to avoid harassment by cops and passersby.\nToday she leads a recycling business with 88 employees and 10 collection trucks. Her ardent advocacy has secured contracts from the local government to collect recyclables in several neighborhoods. She suggested money from the plastic treaty could provide workers with more protective equipment, better working conditions, and opportunities for career advancement like she had.\n“What has happened to my life is just transition,” Indumathi said through a translator provided by Hasiru Dala, a social impact organization that advocates for waste pickers. “I want the same for all waste pickers everywhere.”\nFinally, any funding effort could go into building the hidden infrastructure that makes treaties work. For example, Emmanuel said, many developing countries will not have the resources to write their own action plans on plastic – nationally defined strategies on how to tackle the problem, as with treaties on climate and biodiversity – and should get funding and technical support for them.\nOr if the treaty ends up requiring countries to ban plastics that contain chemicals linked to cancer, but doesn’t specify further, “developing countries would need technical and financial support to create or strengthen their scientific infrastructure to make determinations of what is cancer-causing,” Emmanuel said in an email. That could come as equipment or training for Philippine scientists, for example.\nMoney doesn’t buy everything, of course. Erin Simon, vice president and head of plastic waste and business at the World Wildlife Fund, said plastic-reduction pilots around the world have fizzled out because there was no policy to support them. She wants to see a treaty that includes a range of pro-transition measures – like banning some single-use plastics and making corporations financially responsible for the fate of their packaging — that will give innovators more of a fighting chance.\n“You have tons of levers, but the challenge lies in pulling all the levers together,” she said. “Therein lies the hope of the treaty.”\nThis story was originally published by Grist with the headline One way a plastics treaty could help the Global South: Fund waste management. on Jul 19, 2024.\nThis content originally appeared on Grist and was authored by Saqib Rahim.",

    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — A former Ohio State football player arrested for allegedly robbing a north Columbus bank is a suspect in multiple other bank robberies. Franklin County Municipal Court documents say 25-year-old Marcus Williamson entered the First Merchant's Bank located at [5090 N. High St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vv5BrqDzeEoZrFZRA) on April 24. Williamson approached the teller and gave them a note demanding money and that he was armed with a gun, documents say. The teller complied and gave Williamson an unspecified amount of cash. During a court hearing on Friday, a Columbus Division of Police detective testified that Williamson is a suspect in at least eight other bank robberies. The detective testified Williamson had a pattern — he would drive the same Jeep, wearing latex gloves and a mask and he would hand the teller a note saying he had a gun and he was demanding money. He testified that the police department had a search warrant for Williamson's Jeep and placed a GPS tracking device on it when police say they watched him walk out of the First Merchant's Bank with cash. Williamson was taken into custody moments later. The detective testified the robberies in which Williamson is a suspect happened between March 7 and April 24. Williamson has been charged with one count of aggravated robbery with more charges expected to be filed. A judge set Williamson's bond at $50,000. Williamson's arrest comes nearly two years after he was arrested and charged for kidnapping, robbing and carjacking a woman in Tennessee. The detective who testified in Columbus on Friday said he believes those charges were dropped because of mental incompetency. Williamson, a Westerville native, played [five seasons with the Buckeyes](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/roster/marcus-williamson/) from 2017-2021. He played defensive back and was a part of four consecutive Big Ten championship teams and two teams that made it to the College Football Playoffs. 📺 [ 10TV+ is available for free:](https://www.10tv.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/columbus-ohio-news-streaming-live-24-7-10tv-plus-roku-amazon-fire/530-9e8c7805-6b50-44a5-a403-e5f78e7705b9) Stay up to date on what's happening in your community with a 24/7 live stream and on demand content from 10TV — available on [Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV.](https://www.10tv.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/columbus-ohio-news-streaming-live-24-7-10tv-plus-roku-amazon-fire/530-9e8c7805-6b50-44a5-a403-e5f78e7705b9) 📧 [ Subscribe to the Wake Up CBUS newsletter](https://www.10tv.com/email) featuring the best stories, personally curated by members of our staff and delivered via email by 6 a.m., Monday through Friday.",

    "text": "El presidente de Argentina, Javier Milei , afirmó en una entrevista a The Free Journal publicada este jueves 6 de junio de 2024, que odia al Estado, le encanta ser “ el topo” adentro de este y que está dispuesto a soportar “ mentiras, calumnias e injurias “.\nMás noticias Javier Milei plantea una reforma con la inteligencia artificial de Google Javier Milei se prepara para una manifestación frente a su residencia Javier Milei mezcla el rock, la teoría económica y proclamas antiabortistas “Amo, amo ser el topo dentro del Estado. Soy el que destruye el Estado desde dentro. Es como estar infiltrado en las filas enemigas”, respondió al ser preguntado si le gusta ser “la mofeta del jardín “. Esto ocurrió durante una entrevista realizada la semana pasada en el marco de su gira por Palo Alto (California, EE.UU.).\n“La reforma del Estado la tiene que hacer alguien que odie el Estado y yo odio tanto al Estado que estoy dispuesto a soportar todo este tipo de mentiras, calumnias, injurias , tanto sobre mi persona como mis seres más queridos, que son mi hermana y mis perros y mis padres, con tal de destruir al Estado”, agregó.\nEl mandatario argentino destacó la dura lucha que enfrenta contra lo que denomina una “batalla cultural” . Durante décadas, fue dominada por el socialismo pero que, poco a poco, están recuperando los libertarios.\n“No sólo estamos dando esta batalla en el plano económico y en el plano político. No hemos abandonado la batalla cultural y todo esto va a generar una situación donde Argentina vuelva a crecer”, indicó.\nEn este sentido, insistió en que, tras asumir la Presidencia, el pasado diciembre, su imagen es “más alta” y la aprobación de su Administración “ha mejorado”, al punto en el que aseguró que si hubiera elecciones en el país ahora mismo sacaría el 60 % de los votos.\n“Lo más importante es que significa un cambio de época (…) La gente interpretó y asimiló que todos los atajos del populismo y del socialismo no funcionan, y eso es un elemento para ser muy optimista”, dijo.\nMilei abordó también los esfuerzos de su Gobierno para “ revertir cien años d e historia” abanderados por el “justicialismo” y las ideas “peronistas” que, a su juicio, llevaron al país al borde del colapso.\n“Esta repugnante y aborrecible idea de ‘justicia social’ en realidad va en contra del capital humano porque si estudias, trabajas, te esfuerzas y lo haces bien el Estado vendrá y te robará el dinero y se lo va a dar a gente que no hizo nada. Y eso es un mecanismo para expulsar talento”, aseveró.\nEl mandatario se definió así como un anarcocapitalista que considera al Estado “una organización criminal”.\n“Si no pagas tus impuestos, vas a la cárcel. Esto es violencia institucionalizada (…) Eso es algo que los anarcocapitalistas y libertarios entendemos. El Estado es una organización violenta que vive de una fuente coercitiva, que son los impuestos. Los impuestos no son algo amigable. De hecho, son restos de la esclavitud”, concluyó el presidente.",
