    "text": "MIDLAND, Texas — As flash flooding continues to devastate parts of Central Texas, a local Midland chef is stepping up to provide relief in the best way he knows how through food.\nMichael Olivas, owner and chef of Exquisite Catering in Midland, has partnered with the Full Moon Inn Bed and Breakfast in Fredericksburg, Texas, to feed first responders and volunteers assisting with disaster recovery efforts.\nThe idea began when the inn’s owner, a longtime friend of Olivas, posted a plea for help on Facebook. That message inspired him to take immediate action.\n\"I saw her post and it struck me,\" Olivas said. \"I wanted to help her and ease the stress of cooking, so I decided to go and bring my staff.\"\nSince arriving in Fredericksburg, Olivas has committed to preparing breakfast and dinner for more than 120 people each day. The meals are being offered not only to those staying at the inn but to anyone in the area who needs them.\n\"My calling is to feed people,\" he said. \"And when I can do that, especially in this kind of situation. It's really meaningful to me.\"\nOlivas said he spent $3,000 of his own money on groceries and raised another $4,000 through community support in Midland. He and his team plan to remain in Fredericksburg for six days.\nAs cleanup and search efforts continue in the wake of widespread flooding, Olivas hopes his meals bring a small measure of comfort to those working tirelessly on the front lines.\nClose Ad",

    "text": "An excavator belches out fumes as it clears earth and rubble from between the train and bus stations in the Ukrainian town of Trostianets to make way for a reimagined transport hub.An excavator belches out fumes as it clears earth and rubble from between the train and bus stations in the Ukrainian town of Trostianets to make way for a reimagined transport hub.\nBadly damaged in fighting with Russian forces almost two years ago, Trostianets is one of six settlements being rebuilt with state funds in a pilot programme to develop the skills and experience needed for a far broader reconstruction drive later.\nMayor Yuriy Bova said time was running out to breathe life back into towns, or risk losing millions of Ukrainians who could help redevelop the country to permanent exile in Europe.\n“We’re fighting for every person who should return; for every child who needs to return and build their future here,” he said in the town, barely 30 km from Russia.\n“To walk around and see this every day, that will morally traumatise a person,” Mr. Bova said of the ruined northeastern town. “We need to restore everything, starting with cafes, libraries, factories, schools, hospitals.”\nOfficials in Kyiv have also signalled the urgence of rebuilding Ukraine, an effort that will require hundreds of billions of dollars and involve more than quick fixes to critical sites such as hospitals, power stations and railways.\nThe war, however, shows no signs of abating. Short on cash, Ukraine is defending against new Russian attacks after its own counteroffensive failed to yield significant gains. Moscow has also resumed a campaign of mass air strikes on population centres far beyond the front line.\n‘Unaffordable luxury’ For Pavlo Kuzmenko, the Mayor of Okhtyrka, a town only 20 km down the road from Trostianets that also bears the scars of heavy Russian bombing at the start of the war, resurrecting town squares is a luxury Ukraine cannot afford right now.\nOfficials in Okhtyrka were slow to finish clearing away the rubble on the main boulevard that was once the city hall and have not yet fixed the gutted department store across the street. Most schools, however, have been repaired with new windows, roofing or bomb shelters, thanks in large part to international donors.\nMr. Kuzmenko, who publicly criticised the plans for Trostianets last year and bemoaned a lack of resources, said the focus should be on patching up homes and critical infrastructure only. Any other available funds should go to the military.\n“There is plenty to rebuild,” Kuzmenko said. “Squares, and all their decorations, can be done after the war.”\nStanding near the remains of the city hall, Okhtyrka resident Antonina Dmytrychenko said she agreed with her mayor: “First we need victory, then reconstruction.”\nThe different views in the neighbouring towns reflect a broader debate about wartime spending playing out across Ukraine. Most visibly, a growing grassroots protest movement is demanding that discretionary projects, such as sprucing up streets and public spaces, be shelved in favour of the military.\nIn a sign of the tension, officials in the Odesa region cancelled more than $9 million of tenders during the last three months of 2023, saying spending on things such as road repairs, the renovation of a stadium and software was “unacceptable” during wartime.\nThe disputes highlight the need for a clearly communicated government strategy for what recovery and, more broadly, a war-adapted economy should look like, said Orysia Lutsevych at the Chatham House think-tank in London.\nShe said officials must urgently unlock Ukraine’s economic potential by restoring income-generating growth opportunities that can help defeat Russia — and that meant luring people back as well as stopping more leaving the country for good.\n‘Same equation’ “Militaries win battles, but economies win wars. It’s part of the same equation,” she said.\nIt might make sense, for example, to build more schools in the comparably safer western city of Lviv for the many Ukrainians displaced there by fighting elsewhere, so they will stay and contribute to the wartime economy, Ms. Lutsevych said.\n“This is what rebuilding is: maybe it’s not fancy playgrounds, maybe it’s not new zoos,” she said. “But it must be a category of projects that fits within the wider strategy of how Ukraine will sustain this war.”\nSo far, more than $1.6 billion has been earmarked from the fund for reconstruction, Prime Minister Shmyhal said in October.\nThe pilot projects received about $86 million last year, though the 2024 budget has not yet been set, a spokesperson for the reconstruction agency said.\nOverall, the World Bank has estimated that rebuilding Ukraine will cost more than $400 billion over the next decade, and Western lenders have signalled they are prepared to provide the bulk of the financing.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "title": "Ian Aerts (17) Excels in Fast Food Training Program at KFC - World Today News",
    "text": "Ian Aerts (17) lives on the Left Bank and can therefore easily cycle to the KFC fast food restaurant in the shadow of the cathedral. There he learns the tricks of the fast food trade. “I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, but I did have a great interest in kitchen work.”\nIan is following the Fast Food Employee training course in special education, the Learning Expert in Schoolstraat. This course uses ‘dual learning’ where students spend three days in the work field and two days at school. Ian: “At school we learn about hygiene rules and first aid, but we also receive regular subjects such as physical education and religion.”\nThe training also covers all departments of a fast food restaurant. Ian also works at the cash registers in the front station, prepares the burgers in the mid-station and learns to prepare everything fresh in the back station.\n“The work in the kitchen cannot be underestimated,” emphasizes Joren Jonckers (30), the HR manager. “I was there for a week myself because I wanted to know how it all works. The chickens arrive here fresh and are breaded, marinated and fried in our kitchen.”\nIn addition, there are also strict rules for the shelf life of the products. “For example, on a screen in the kitchen you can see how long the chicken wings have been ready. They must be thrown away after 45 minutes. So you have to keep a close eye on when something is running low or needs to be remade,” Ian explains neatly.\nJoren Jonckers (right) is the HR manager at KFC and is a big supporter of dual learning. — © Margot De Clercq\nSix students are currently following the training at Leerexpert. “The school feels the growth potential of this course, because it is not yet well known,” says Sofie De Keyser, spokesperson for Municipal Education.\nBecause the students are really in the professional field, they have had to discover a lot independently. Ian: “I learned a lot from all the managers here. They are always ready with tips and I could always ask questions if something was unclear.”\nManager When Ian graduates in June, he will enjoy his well-deserved summer vacation. But after that he can count on a permanent contract in this KFC branch. Joren Jonckers from KFC: “It is very nice that such an option as dual learning is available. It also fulfills a social importance for us and it is an ideal way of recruitment. Ian learned the rules with us, so he knows exactly how we work.”\nNow Ian always worked from 10 a.m. to 5 or 6 p.m., but with a permanent contract he will of course also have to work at night. “I have no problem with that, I’m quite a night owl. I am looking forward to it and also have the ambition to grow as a manager.”\nAccording to Joren, that is also no problem. “We really like this way of working because we have been able to contribute to many success stories. Schools now know that we are open to collaborations and are increasingly contacting us.”\nIan has manned every station in the branch, from cash register to kitchen. — © Margot De Clercq\n2024-04-11 16:31:00\n#studying #Fast #Food #Employee #immediately #signed #contract #KFC #students #working #field",
