    "title": "Victims of sexual assault and harassment in the Coast Guard call for major changes after Senate committee’s new report | News Channel 3-12",
    "text": "By Morgan Rimmer, CNN\n(CNN) — Five former and current members of the US Coast Guard testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday about their experiences with sexual assault and harassment while serving and called for major changes to how the Coast Guard handles reports.\nAfter months of investigation across both chambers, the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s subcommittee on investigations released a 48-page majority staff report on Wednesday, detailing the decades of abuse and cover-ups. It’s the first to be released out of a string of ongoing government inquiries triggered by CNN’s reporting on a secret Coast Guard probe into sexual abuse at its prestigious Coast Guard Academy. That investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, was kept secret from the public and even Congress despite substantiating dozens of past assaults.\nMeghan Lori Klement, a former Seaman, told the committee Thursday that she had felt like she was in a “nightmare” after she was harassed and assaulted for months by a retired senior chief who was contracted to her base.\nKlement noted that she was pulled aside and told to “think about the life and career” of the perpetrator. “I was a young girl, and I was really scared,” she said. “When he said those words to me, I lost all hope, felt ashamed and embarrassed. I felt completely discredited, and that has followed me around for 11 years.”\nShe said a turning point was when someone with a higher rank finally committed to supporting her. “When I realized that I had somebody who held some sort of rank and position standing behind me, that is when I became really brave,” Klement said. “There’s a lot of power in that.”\nKlement also said that she has not been given access to the documents around her own case, while she was active duty or afterward. “We’ll see if I ever get (them) back,” she said.\nJulian Bell, a Chief Warrant Officer 4, too said he received “absolutely nothing” about his own case, and that his requests through the Freedom of Information Act have been denied.\nCrystal Van Den Heuvel, a Yeoman Petty Officer First Class, recounted how a man she worked with told her that he had thought about stealing her underwear on multiple occasions, and that while she was in a car with him, he kept trying to reach into her bag and saying he wanted to smell her underwear. Van Den Heuvel said the man did not stop until she threatened to leave him on the side of the road and have his wife pick him up.\nDuring the hearing, Van Den Heuvel pushed for the idea that command should not be able to evaluate victims for a year after they come forward about assault, so that they don’t face retaliation. Instead, Van Den Heuvel said that victims need an outside agency to evaluate their cases “so that there is no conflict of interest” within command. Several other witnesses agreed, as Van Den Heuvel noted that commanding officers often are friendly with each other, and even went to the Coast Guard Academy together.\nShawna Christine Ward, a retired Chief Warrant Officer 4, was one of the witnesses who said that there should be a third party to evaluate victim statements and investigations.\n“It’s the exact same story, and the Coast Guard is just saying, ‘It’s OK.’ I’m tired of the words,” Ward said. “I’m tired of the word ‘commitment.’ There is no commitment. Words are not enough to fix it. Action actually has to be taken in order to do it.”\nIn closing, Ward told the committee, “I loved the Coast Guard. I still do. But there is a certain part of the Coast Guard that is completely broken.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Cryptocurrency re-surfaced with force in 2023, after a dismal two-year covid performance, reaching all-time high Bitcoin (BTC) prices of more than US$35,000.\nToday, Bitcoin is trading at more than US$42,000 at a maximum supply of 21 million coins, and there are predictions it could surge to new heights in 2024.\nBut what happened this year to propel this industry?\nThe Market Herald has compiled a list of some of the biggest stories to headline the crypto industry in 2023, with expert commentary from Investment Analyst Matthew Harcourt from cryptocurrency investment company\nApollo Crypto.\nMr Harcourt delves into the news headlines, trends and precedents that have set the trajectory for the industry as it heads into 2024.\nRegulatory landscape\nCrypto assets run on a technological platform known as a\nblockchain, enabling investors to confirm transactions without needing clearance from a central finance authority.\nThe platform itself is highly unregulated, however, this year there’s been heavy talk on how it can be regulated to increase financial security across the board.\nIn October this year, Australia saw some action with the Federal Government’s release of a proposal paper outlining recommendations to\nenhance the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n“Going into 2024, the regulatory crackdown is likely to shift from centralised exchanges to decentralised exchanges…,” Mr Harcourt explained.\nCentralised exchanges are controlled by one major entity, which means faster transactions and easier use. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers for higher liquidity.\nDecentralised exchanges offer lower transaction fees and allow users to hold onto their crypto assets, meaning they can avoid some of the regulatory burdens already in place.\n“…a little bit of worry is in the market about the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) trying to apply the old rule of law to these completely new technologies and businesses to sort of better their interests – which is pretty much what they did with centralised exchanges throughout this year…,” Mr Harcourt said.\nMr Harcourt said the crypto industry was geared to experience continual regulatory clarity from leading jurisdictions like Hong Kong, Europe and parts of the Middle East in 2024.\n“I suspect that the U.S. will continue to fight the industry and push innovation off-shore -as has been the trend for years,” he predicted.\nGrayscale and the SEC\nThis year, the world’s largest crypto asset manager,\nGrayscale, took the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the rejection of its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe legal dispute concluded with the SEC instructed to discard its initial rejection grounds. Grayscale emerged victorious, securing approval to launch the ETF.\nThe anticipated debut for the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF is now slated for January 2024, marking the first substantial deadline for filing denial.\n“Grayscale’s win in court shows that when the rule of law is fairly applied, the SEC will not be able to use its overwhelming power and resources in an unfair way,” Mr Harcourt said.\n“Going forward, it shows that the SEC will need to operate more fairly with the crypto industry as they will not be able to bully the industry the same way when in court.”\nCrypto crime crackdowns\nThe SEC has had its victories too.\nThis year, one of the wealthiest individuals to ever grace the crypto industry experienced his downfall. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on fraud charges concerning his FTX crypto exchange.\nHis empire crashed in November 2022 at a value of $40 billion, along with his Alameda Research trading firm, forcing Mr Bankman-Fried to file for bankruptcy.\nMr Bankman-Fried is serving a maximum sentence of 115 years in a US prison.\nWithin weeks of that decision, the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was fined $50 million and stepped down as CEO after pleading guilty in a Washington District Court to violating US federal law.\nMr Zhao violated laws that require financial institutions to guard against money laundering and terrorist financing. He’s due to be sentenced early next year.\nBinance as a company pleaded guilty to wilfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act, knowingly failing to register as a money transmitting business, and willfully violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\nThe US Department of Justice alleged its platform accommodated criminals across the world who used Binance to move their stolen funds and other criminal proceeds.\n“Binance enabled nearly $900 million in transactions between U.S. and Iranian users,”\nThe Department of Justice Attorney General Merrick Garland reported.\n“And it facilitated millions of dollars in transactions between U.S. users and users in Syria and the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.\n“For example, between August 2017 and April 2022, there were direct transfers of approximately $106 million in bitcoin to Binance.com wallets from Hydra, Hydra was a popular Russian darknet marketplace, frequently utilised by criminals, that facilitated the sale of illegal goods and services.\n“From February 2018 to May 2019, Binance processed more than $275 million in deposits and $273 million in withdrawals from Bestmixer. Bestmixer was one of the largest cryptocurrency anonymizing services in the world before it was shut down for money laundering.\n“Binance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law – it pretended to comply.\n“The message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal.\n“The Justice Department is requiring Binance to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and forfeiture.”\nSun charges hit celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan\nEarlier, in March, the SEC announced charges against crypto asset entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his companies, Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation and Rainberry, for the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities Tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT).\nThe SEC also charged Sun and his companies with fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX through extensive wash trading, involving simultaneous, or near-simultaneous, buying and selling of a security, so it seems actively traded without an actual change in ownership. Interestingly it also laid charges around orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation.\nThe SEC simultaneously charged the following eight celebrities for illegally touting the securities without disclosing their compensation – those celebrities included Lindsay Lohan. She was ordered to repay the US$10,000 she was paid to promote Sun’s TRX and BTT to her 8.4 million Twitter, or X, followers, plus a US$30,000 penalty.\nRecent reports suggest some platforms that Sun backed, including exchange HTX, had been hacked for well over US$100.\nSEC keeping watch\nWhen asked about his main concerns regarding crypto crime heading into 2024, Mr Harcourt said there were others in the industry that the SEC would be watching. For one, it has been trying to serve a lawsuit against Hex and PulseChain Founder Richard Heart.\n2024 predictions\nWhile Mr Harcourt said there was no way to know for certain if Bitcoin would edge even higher in 2024, the strong support for a Bitcoin ETF suggests the market is poised to see some positive action.\n“…if the macro picture stays favourable…I do think you’re going to get strong price action in Bitcoin and then that will flow onto the crypto market more broadly,” he said.\nMr Harcourt emphasised that Bitcoin ETFs could be a catalyst for institutional adoption, as they boast easy, safe and accessible investment characteristics for large companies.\nInternational crypto giant BlackRock also joined the ETF industry with an Ethereum fund under its iShares Ethereum Trust division. This was confirmed in early November through a listing on the NASDAQ.\n“…at the moment, there’s there’s a lot of hurdles from these internal compliance perspectives and so an ETF that’s created by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world … there’s no lower barrier to entry into buying Bitcoin than that institution, essentially,” he continued.\nLastly, Mr Harcourt touched on the utilisation of blockchain technology, by banks through what’s known as tokenisation. Tokenisation is the blockchain digital representation of assets.\n“Going forward you may start to see competition from other banks heating up in the tokenisation space, banks will also look to become crypto custodians,” he said.",

    "text": "Bishop T.D. Jakes, the renowned televangelist and leader of The Potter’s House megachurch in Dallas, Texas, finds himself at the center of controversy as unverified allegations circulate on social media. The accusations claim that Jakes has been a frequent participant in sex parties hosted by music mogul Sean Combs, commonly known as Diddy. These sensational claims, however, have been vehemently denied by a representative for Bishop T.D. Jakes. Jordan A. Hora, the executive director of public relations and communications for the T.D. Jakes Group, T.D. Jakes Ministries, and The Potter’s House, released an exclusive statement to The Christian Post, categorically dismissing the allegations as “unequivocally false and baseless.” Quoting the late Pastor Charles H. Spurgeon, Hora emphasized the challenge of combating falsehoods in the age of social media. “If you want the truth to go round the world you must hire an express train to pull it; but if you want a lie to go round the world, it will fly; it is as light as a feather, and a breath will carry it,” he added. The representative went on to clarify that the accusations against Bishop T.D. Jakes are rooted in false and sensationalized misrepresentations, including the use of deepfake photos. As these claims gained traction on social media platforms, a YouTube channel named Tuff News TV alleged that singer Cassie had turned over a burner phone belonging to the late model Kim Porter. Supposedly, this phone contained recordings of Diddy’s alleged “sex parties” attended by Jakes. However, the source of these allegations remains unverified, and Tuff News TV has yet to respond to requests for comment from The Christian Post. Despite the unverified nature of the accusations, the controversy has prompted a response from Jakes’ team, underlining their commitment to creating positive change globally through compassion, service, and ministry. The team also highlighted Jakes’ longstanding reputation as a prominent figure in the Christian community, recognized for his books and philanthropic work. Derrick Williams, executive vice president of TD Jakes Entertainment, provided additional context, explaining that Bishop Jakes, in his role as CEO of T.D. Jakes Entertainment, had attended an event celebrating Diddy’s birthday. Williams clarified that Jakes’ appearance was a brief and respectful acknowledgment, and any suggestion of impropriety is “wholly unsubstantiated, unverified, and false.” Williams emphasized that Bishop Jakes will continue to break down barriers and find meaningful ways to share faith-based and value-based stories, reaffirming this as their guiding principle. As these unverified allegations continue to circulate, Christians are reminded to approach such claims with caution and seek the truth. The Bible teaches the importance of compassion and care for others, urging believers to exercise discernment and withhold judgment until verified information is available. Spreading unverified information, especially of such a sensitive nature, can be harmful, and the pursuit of truth remains paramount in addressing any allegations.",

    "text": "There is a new big man in Los Angeles, one who hopes he can have a major impact on any team he plays for.\nThe LA Lakers have signed center Trey Jemison, waiving guard Quincy Olivari , tweaking their roster with a move they hope can pay off.\nCenter is a position the Lakers are light at, and there have been trade rumors linking the team with the likes of Jonas Valanciunas .\nJemison has experience on the Wizards, Grizzlies and Pelicans, and joins after being waived in New Orleans just days ago.\nPhoto by Nick Cammett/Getty Images Trey Jemison has the physical tools Trey Jemison has the physical tools to succeed in the NBA, standing at 6 10″, and claims to be ‘elite’ at doing the dirty work battling to win the ball back for his team.\nSpeaking to the Pelicans podcast earlier this season, Jemison compared his physique to former Lakers big man Dwight Howard .\nHe explained: “These are genetics, I was blessed with Dwight Howard shoulders from a young age.\n“I try to use them to set those screens and handle my business.”\nJemison has signed a two-way deal with the Lakers and hopes for an opportunity to help the team, in their efforts to make the play-offs and make an impact .\nTrey Jemison aims high Trey Jemison added that he sets his targets high, and aims to lead the whole NBA in offensive rebounds.\nHe explained: “I have a goal, and my mindset is to set high goals, and if you fall short, you probably did good no matter what.\n“I want to lead the league in offensive rebounding. If I do that, I give my team more chances to get open shots.\n“I’m not here to score the ball, we have amazing scorers in our team, and to get them to shoot the ball one more time would be great.”\nNow on the Lakers, there will be more pressure and attention on Jemison than he has experienced before.\nDuring his senior year at UAB, Jemison led the Conference USA in rebounds per game, showing he can back up his talk.\nTransferring that to the NBA is more difficult, with 13 rebounds in a game his best return, while his season average on the Pelicans was 4.3 per game – yet as he points out, there is nothing wrong with aiming high.",

    "text": "On December 20th, after submitting proof of MSB registration completion, Enet Crypto Center Limited (hereinafter referred to as Enet) officially obtained the U.S. Fincen MSB license on November 15. This marks a further step in Enet's compliance journey, allowing it to legally conduct currency exchange business in the United States, further expanding its international development space. This establishes a solid foundation for serving global users and enables Enet to provide users with safer, compliant, efficient, and convenient digital economic transaction services\nSince 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission have repeatedly emphasized that MSBs (Money Services Businesses) include virtual currency exchanges and their managers. The regulated entities are businesses and companies related to financial services. The regulatory scope includes international remittances, foreign exchange, currency trading, ICO issuance, and management of prepaid projects. Operating digital asset-related business within the United States requires a license. Hence, Enet’s possession of the license grants it legal status in the U.S., distinguishing it from other irregular platforms.\nEnet Exchange has always sought higher-level and broader development. As a global leader in decentralized exchanges, it is committed to breaking national boundaries and achieving global integration. Based on Enet's public blockchain technology, it aims to realize scenario implementations in various fields, including capital, digital asset management, digital asset payment, blockchain charity, blockchain gaming, blockchain entertainment, blockchain shopping, and blockchain community games, thereby creating a complete decentralized digital asset ecosystem.\nHolding a license is of great significance for current exchanges. Obtaining official permission from the respective countries reflects the strength and credibility of the exchange. For most exchanges, a license also acts as a natural barrier for selection. For users, Enet's compliant operation under regulatory conditions is a major advantage, meaning their investments will receive legal protection. Under official permission, Enet strictly meets local regulatory requirements and user protection regulations.\nEnet will continue to advance its compliance and globalization development, providing safe and convenient digital asset transaction services to more global users. It also calls on other platforms to join the regular development path, contributing to the industry's progress and hoping to achieve industry compliance consensus.\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice. It is strongly recommended that you practice due diligence (including consultation with a professional financial advisor) before investing in or trading securities and cryptocurrency.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Enet Crypto Center Limited\nContact Person: Roger Brown\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://enetcoin.cc/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudQuote: .io\nStock Quote: s supplied by Barchart\nQuote: s delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "Va in archivio un’altra serata di partite – quella di giovedì 16 gennaio – nell’Alps Hockey League 2024-2025 . Un menù ricco di partite, con tante squadre italiane impegnate sul ghiaccio: ecco come sono andate le cose.\nBene i Vipiteno Broncos, capaci di battere 6-4 il Bregenzerwald, grazie a uno strappo operato nel secondo parziale, dopo l’1-1 iniziale, a firma di De Lorenzo Meo, Eisendle, Sanvido e Capanelli. I padroni di casa vanno sul 5-1 a meno di sette minuti dalla fine. La gara sembra finita, ma gli ospiti rientrano clamorosamente fino al 5-4. A pochi secondi dalla fine però, con gli austriaci in regime di “Empty Net”, è Zandegiacomo a chiudere definitivamente i conti con la rete che griffa definitivamente il successo per 6-4.\nVittoria anche per il Renon, che in casa del Cortina si impone 2-5. Öhler, apripista delle marcature, e compagni, vanno avanti 1-3 subendo poi il parziale ritorno dei cortinesi. Sul 2-3 però, i padroni di casa non riescono a impattare venendo trafitti – a porta sguarnita – dalle segnature di Spinell e Giacomuzzi.\nVanno ko invece Gherdeina e Merano: i primi 5-7 contro l’Adler Stadtwerke Kitzbühel, in una partita ricca di emozioni, decisa nel terzo e ultimo parziale dalla doppietta di De Luca, dopo il 5-5 dei primi due tempi di gioco. I secondi invece non riescono a creare nulla di pericoloso contro l’EK Die Zeller Eisbären venendo battuti 0-4.\nIn classifica, Renon momentaneamente primo con 67 punti raccolti in 33 partite . Vipiteno in 6a piazza con 49 punti in 32 partite, non guadagnano punti invece Cortina (5° con 54 punti), Merano (7° con 42 punti) e Gherdeina (13esimo con 31 punti). L’Alps Hockey League 2025-2026 tornerà in campo sabato 18 gennaio.",
