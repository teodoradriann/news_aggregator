    "title": "Las bombas del Colo Mac Allister en la previa al superclásico: “Los cagones no hacen historia\"",
    "text": "El superclásico no es un partido más. Por lo general, puede definir el semestre, el año, generar un antes y un después. Y más aún si de Boca se trata, que quedó eliminado tempranamente en la Copa Sudamericana y está a nueve puntos de Vélez, el líder del campeonato. Por eso, en la previa al partido del sábado, Carlos Mac Allister, el ex lateral izquierdo que jugó 180 partidos con la camiseta azul y oro, fue al hueso sobre cómo se debe jugar está clase de partidos. El Colo se ganó al hincha de Boca cuando llegó de Argentinos por su entrega y garra dentro de la cancha en cada partido y es por eso que le pide a los jugadores que hagan lo mismo el próximo sábado. \"Los cagones no hacen historia, los Boca a River se juegan a morir. Boca tiene que convertirse en un equipo arrollador. La historia de Boca nunca fue meterse atrás. Hay que salir a ganar en todos lados\", dijo en declaraciones a radio Mitre. No solo se expresó sobre la manera que se debe jugar el superclásico, sino que hizo un análisis de cómo juegan ambos equipos y fue bastante crítico con el de Martínez. \"Más que nunca es una incógnita el clásico. River hizo incorporaciones con un DT y terminó de armar el equipo con otro. Gallardo en estos últimos partido dio señales. Boca un día parece un equipo bárbaro, otro uno mediocre y otro uno malo\". Y agregó: \"Siento que es un equipo que todavía no representa al entrenador, no sé si eligió a todos los jugadores que él quería. Se fue armando de a pedazos\". \"¿Qué River se va a ver, el que ganó los últimos partidos con Gallardo o el que ganó con autoridad el finde? ¿Qué Boca, el que jugó unos partidos y parecía que se recuperaba o titubeante, que no define bien, que comete errores zonzos? Va a ser un lindo clásico, los dos necesitan ganar\", cerró el papá de Alexis. Su visión del Riquelme dirigente No es la primera vez que Mac Allister opina sobre la gestión de Riquelme. Su conflicto con el máximo ídolo de la historia de Boca comenzó cuando dejaron ir a su hijo, Alexis al Brighton de manera anticipada. Y hoy volvió a apuntar contra la dirigencia recordando unas palabras de Román. \"Soy crítico de la gestión Riquelme. Se ha errado en muchos refuerzos. Creo que lo que se planteaba de ganar copas internacionales no sucedió y aún no ha logrado armar una base confiable. Sí se han hecho muy buenas ventas\", sostuvo.",

    "title": "US announces $325 million in funding to boost Puerto Rico solar projects as power outages persist",
    "text": "SAN JUAN – The U.S. government announced Thursday that $325 million in federal funds will be available for solar and battery storage installations across Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory struggles with chronic power outages . The program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, will target community centers and healthcare facilities, as well as common areas in subsidized, multi-family housing. Recommended Videos “Households aren’t the only place you need power during and after an emergency,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm during a visit to Puerto Rico. The announcement comes amid widespread anger over outages that repeatedly leave Puerto Ricans in the dark. The island of 3.2 million people has a more than 40% poverty rate and some cannot afford a generator. Government officials say the outages also endanger the lives of those who depend on oxygen, refrigerated insulin and dialysis machines. Granholm on Thursday visited the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel, one of several towns in the area hit by a power outage in June that left 10,000 customers in the dark. That same month, another widespread outage left some 350,000 customers without power across Puerto Rico, prompting Gov. Pedro Pierluisi to order an investigation. “It is unacceptable,” Granholm said of the situation. The outage in Santa Isabel and nearby towns prompted Luma, a private company that operates the transmission and distribution of power, to install emergency generators. Luma also launched a $4-million effort to transport and install a new mega transformer in the area, but the plan failed after crews discovered that an “internal problem” rendered the equipment unusable, further enraging customers and government officials. Luma recently said it would relocate another transformer based in the southeast coastal town of Maunabo, but the announcement angered the local mayor, who blocked access to the equipment, saying his town depended on it. Luma has said that transformer is not essential to providing electricity to Maunabo. On Sunday, Luma warned that at least 11 transformers in electric substations across Puerto Rico are “vulnerable,” and if they were to fail, tens of thousands of customers would be left without power. Puerto Rico’s power grid remains frail nearly seven years after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, leaving some without electricity for up to a year. While the storm razed the power grid, it had long been crumbling given a lack of investment and maintenance by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is s till trying to restructure more than $9 billion in debt . Prior to Maria, renewable energy generation in Puerto Rico was at 3%. It has since grown to 9% thanks to homes and businesses that have been able to afford to install rooftop solar and storage, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Amid the outages, Puerto Ricans have been hit with power bill increases that many have decried. Puerto Rico’s electricity rate is now 41% higher than the average U.S. rate. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy also announced an $861 million loan guarantee to help build two solar photovoltaic farms in the southern towns of Guayama and Salinas. The guarantee was offered to Clean Flexible Energy, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of AES Corporation and TotalEnergies Holdings USA, Inc. Prior to arriving in Puerto Rico, Granholm visited the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday, where officials announced $100 million in federal funds to help buy fuel storage facilities. The U.S. territory also has struggled with chronic power outages in recent years, with island-wide outages hitting St. John and St. Thomas the day Granholm visited. Nearly three months ago, Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. declared a state of emergency following ongoing blackouts on St. Croix. The U.S. Virgin Islands Water & Power Authority faces crumbling infrastructure, with various local agencies including the waste management authorities and entities such as hospitals owing more than $11 million in total accumulated debt.",

    "text": "By Erik Waxler ,\n3 hours ago When you walk into Father and Son Love Free Food Pantry, your first stop is their Veterans Wall of Honor.\n“These are actually hats and things that were in wars and we have that and we have the ability to honor that and keep legacies alive,” said volunteer Dawnell Schofield.\nThis pantry inside a Land O’Lakes church focuses on helping veterans, first responders, and the elderly.\nBut they are open to everyone and want them all to have a dignified experience.\nThat’s why the place is as clean and organized as any top-notch grocery store.\n“Nobody leaves out of here without getting what you need and what you want,” said Schofield.\nWhen Schofield got laid off, she came here for help.\n“It was scary because another job didn’t come up within a couple of weeks. My lease was ending. And I didn’t have anywhere else to go and you know how hard it is to find a place to live when you don’t have a job,” she said.\nIt took six months, but Dawnell is finally back at work.\nBut she returns here every morning to volunteer.\n“I’m one of the people who picks out everything to make sure that the selection is fresh,” Schofield said.\nInspired by his late mother, Pastor C.J. Johns Senior started this pantry six years ago, but he is struggling to keep it going after the landlord doubled the rent.\n“We have done everything we could to stay open primarily because I have put all my chips on the table,” Johns said.\nPastor Johns says a corporate sponsor would really help.\nIn the meantime, they aren’t slowing down, bringing in mobile showers, free haircuts, and more of the perfectly displayed food that helps so many.\n“We bring them in and we hug them and feed them regardless of smell. Regardless of mental capacity. We take care of them,” Schofield said.\nLearn more about the Father Son and Love Free Food Pantry's website by clicking here .\nLatest Pasco County News from ABC Action News\nPasco food pantry honors vets, changing lives even after rent was doubled Erik Waxler\n3:20 PM, Mar 14, 2024\nPasco County works on design of road widening project to improve traffic Keely McCormick\n6:59 AM, Mar 14, 2024\nNew Pasco non-profit opens to help other charitable organizations Erik Waxler\n3:02 PM, Mar 13, 2024\nWheelchair-bound mom desperate for accessible van Erik Waxler\n6:08 PM, Mar 12, 2024\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
