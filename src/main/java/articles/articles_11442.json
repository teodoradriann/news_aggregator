    "title": "U.S. intelligence officials determined the Chinese spy balloon used a U.S. internet provider to communicate – DNyuz",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence officials have determined that the Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. earlier this year used an American internet service provider to communicate, according to two current and one former U.S. official familiar with the assessment.\nThe balloon connected to a U.S.-based company, according to the assessment, to send and receive communications from China, primarily related to navigation of the balloon. Officials familiar with assessment said it found that the connection allowed the balloon to send burst transmissions, or high-bandwidth collections of data over short periods of time.\nThe Biden administration sought a highly secretive court order from the federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to collect intelligence on it while it was over the U.S., according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. How the court ruled has not been disclosed.\nSuch a court order would have allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance on the balloon as it flew over the U.S and as it sent and received messages to and from China, the officials said, including communication sent via the American internet service provider.\nThe company denied that the Chinese balloon had used its network, a determination it said was based on its own investigation and discussions it had with U.S. officials.\nNBC News is not naming the provider at this time to protect the identity of its sources.\nA National Security Council spokesperson referred questions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The DNI declined to comment.\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said that it was a weather balloon that accidentally drifted into American airspace.\n“As we had made it clear before, the airship, used for meteorological research, unintentionally drifted into U.S. because of the westerlies and its limited self-steering capability,” Liu said in a statement to NBC News. “The facts are clear.”\nChinese intelligence officials have covertly used commercially available service providers in various countries in the past, often as backup communication networks, according to multiple former U.S. officials. They frequently seek out encrypted networks or ones with strong security protocols so they can communicate securely, the officials said.\nThe previously unreported U.S. effort to monitor the balloon’s communications could be one reason Biden administration officials have insisted that they got more intelligence out of the device than it got as it flew over the U.S.\nSenior administration officials have said that the U.S. was able to protect sensitive sites on the ground because they closely tracked the balloon’s projected flight path. The U.S. military moved or obscured sensitive equipment so the balloon could not collect images or video while overhead.\nAfter the balloon was shot down on Feb. 4, Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, told reporters that the U.S. military and intelligence community had taken exhaustive steps to protect against the balloon’s ability to collect intelligence.\n“We took maximum precaution to prevent any intell collection,” VanHerck said during a briefing. “So that we could take maximum protective measures while the balloon transited across the United States.”\nIn an exclusive interview with NBC News this month, VanHerck explained that he worked together with the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees U.S. nuclear weapons, to reduce the release of emergency action messages to ensure the Chinese balloon could not collect them.\n“We took action to put capabilities away, whether that be airplanes, ballistic missiles in our missile fields,” VanHerck said. “We limited our emission of emergency action messages that could be potentially collected on.”\nEmergency action messages (EAM) are how U.S. national leaders communicate with strategic forces all around the world. The messages are highly classified and can include directing nuclear capable forces on response options in the case of a nuclear war.\n“Protecting EAM and nuclear command and control communications is of critical importance to the United States,” a senior defense official told NBC News.\nAfter the balloon was shot down, a senior State Department official said it was used by China for surveillance and was loaded with equipment capable of collecting signals intelligence.\nThe balloon had multiple antennas, including an array likely capable of collecting and geo-locating communications, the official said. It was also powered by enormous solar panels that generated enough power to operate intelligence collection sensors, the official said.\nDefense and intelligence officials have said that the U.S. assessment is that the balloon was not able to transmit intelligence back to China while over the U.S.\nThe FBI forensics team who examined the balloon after it was shot down completed a classified report about the equipment it carried, according to multiple U.S. officials. Their findings remain secret and have not been widely briefed.\nFederal judges on the surveillance court, where proceedings are held in secret, must determine whether there is probable cause that the surveillance target is a foreign power or foreign agent and that the surveillance is necessary to obtain foreign intelligence information. The court’s rulings are classified.\nThe post U.S. intelligence officials determined the Chinese spy balloon used a U.S. internet provider to communicate appeared first on NBC News .",

    "title": "Edmonton tourism boomed in 2023 with big events | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Hosting the Junos in March was a watershed moment for Edmonton and Alberta in 2023. It's a night Alberta musicians didn't take for granted. Playing the Junos — the annual awards showcase for Canada's music industry — in their home province is a big deal. \"The fact that it's in the home province, that's icing on the cake right there,\" frontman Chad Kroeger of multi-platinum-selling band Nickelback, whose members hail from Hanna, Alta., told reporters during the event held at Rogers Place. Getting the awards extravaganza to Edmonton took time. \"For Junos, we'd been working to get that event to our city since I want to say 2016,\" Janelle Janis, the executive director of events and business development for Explore Edmonton, the city's tourism arm, told CTV News Edmonton in a year-end interview. Explore Edmonton is one of the organizations that works to bring major events to the city, such as this year's Junos, the Heritage Classic featuring the Edmonton Oilers and the Calgary Flames in October at Commonwealth Stadium and the Style Experience , a FIS Snowboard Big Air World Cup event, in December, also at Commonwealth. It decides which ones to pursue based on its three key pillars: economic impact, image and reputation, and social and community benefits. \"It is the people that make Edmonton a special place and we just support events like no other city,\" Janis said. \"We are one of the best fanbases in Canada, in my opinion.\" That local support is what helped Edmonton see an economic impact of $165 million, support 46,000 jobs and book around 115,000 hotel stays during events throughout the year. \"(Tourists are) coming in Friday or they're coming in Thursday night and they're making a weekend of it,\" Jordan Beatty, the operations manager of four Edmonton-area pubs that make up the Sherlock Holmes Hospitality Group, told CTV News Edmonton. \"That's the sort of thing those big events do for us, and we see it and plan for it.\" He said the bigger the events that come to Edmonton and \"the more people that come to town, the busier we are.\" \"When Garth Brooks was in town (for back-to-back shows at Commonwealth in 2022) or Luke Combs was in town (in June 2023, also at Commonwealth) — for those stadium tours, these hotels are full, which means we're busy for lunch and in the afternoon,\" Beatty said. \"People go shopping, they're pre-concert drinking, they're post-concert drinking, they're getting off the (LRT) train to go back to their hotel. The bigger the event, the busier we are. It's just that simple.\" Puneeta McBryan, the chief executive officer of the Edmonton Downtown Business Association, says making sure these rushes occur year-round is important to its members. \"If we can do that enough times throughout the year, January to December, then we can make sure that even if offices are a little slower, even if it's not hockey season, we've still got a steady flow of people coming in and using downtown for social purposes, entertainment purposes, business purposes,\" McBryan told CTV News Edmonton. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, McBryan said tourism and major events for downtowns in Edmonton, across North America and even globally is a \"major part\" of any revitalization strategy. \"Every downtown that I've studied, which is a lot of them, that's doing very well, tourism and events are a big part of their strategy,\" she said. \"It's getting people into hotel rooms, into bars and restaurants, walking around shopping, making our city into a bit of a destination for a trip, so they may be coming for an event but they're probably going to stay a few extra days.\" The city is back to enjoying a full slate of events following the pandemic, even rising above numbers seen before it, Janis said. \"Right now as it stands, we have surpassed the levels that we were at in 2019, which is pretty incredible to be able to state,\" she said. \"I think Edmontonians are major sports fans, so when it comes to hosting the major sports events that we bring to the city, people are going to come out in droves, people are going to come out and cheer. \"It doesn't matter if it's a summer night or a freezing cold winter day, people are going to come out and support major events.\" Shopping Trends The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "text": "La onubense Carolina Marín, quinta cabeza de serie, se clasificó este jueves para los cuartos de final del prestigioso All England, el torneo más antiguo de bádminton que se juega en Birmingham (Reino Unido), tras imponerse con facilidad a la china Wang Zhi Yi. La onubense, ganadora en 2015 de este torneo de categoría Super 1000 del circuito Mundial que empezó a disputarse en 1899, superó en 41 minutos a la asiática, novena jugadora del mundo, por un claro 13-21 y 8-21. En cuartos de final le espera otra china, Chen Yu Fei, número dos del mundo y que derrotó a la tailandesa Busanan Ongbamrungphan por 22-20 y 21-16. Se trata del segundo triunfo de Marín frente a Wang Zhi Yi en tres partidos. Hasta hoy, cada una había logrado imponerse en una ocasión, la española ganó precisamente en el All England de 2020 y la china se impuso en el Abierto de Indonesia de 2022, en ambos casos en la fase de octavos. La tres veces campeona del mundo, seis de Europa y campeona olímpica en 2016 se mostró \"muy, muy contenta\" por la actuación de este jueves y \"por las mejoras\" que ha podido introducir \"tanto de actitud como de nivel de juego\". Respecto a su partido de cuartos de final, la andaluza explicó que lo afronta \"con muchísimas ganas\" y consciente de que le espera un partido duro frente a Chen Yu Fei que afrontará con la intención de dar \"lo mejor\" de sí para colarse en semifinales.
