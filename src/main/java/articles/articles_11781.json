    "text": "It wasn't until a cluster of Listeria cases emerged in Ontario that the federal health agency says it was able to find the source of an outbreak that's now linked to three deaths and 20 infections. Ever since the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced a national recall of several Silk and Great Value plant-based milk products on July 8, questions have swirled around why it took nearly a year to pull affected products from store shelves. Health experts say multiple factors likely complicated efforts to identify the origins of this particular outbreak, including the relative rarity of finding Listeria in plant-based beverages and the long incubation period of listeriosis cases — the illness caused by Listeria bacteria. “It's an epidemiological puzzle and you need to put the pieces together before you can start to see the picture,” says Lori Burrows, a microbiologist at McMaster University in Hamilton. For its part, the Public Health Agency of Canada says it was only able to connect a Listeria case reported in August 2023 to a broader outbreak after several infections emerged in Ontario in June 2024. The federal health agency says it became aware in September 2023 of two genetically related listeriosis cases, but knew of no common food exposure. But when nine cases were reported in Ontario many months later, a provincial investigation was launched, says agency spokesperson Anna Maddison. “Investigators were able to re-contact the cases from 2023 and determine that they also consumed the implicated beverages prior to becoming ill,” Maddison said in a statement emailed Wednesday. As of that latest update Monday, there were 20 cases in Canada, including infected people in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Alberta. There have been three deaths in Ontario linked to the outbreak, including two people in Toronto, the city’s public health agency has said. The source of the illness has been traced to a specific production line at a third-party beverage packaging facility in Pickering, Ont., used by plant-milk manufacturer Danone Canada. The facility was shutdown on July 6 and production has been halted since then. Danone's head of communications says the company is increasing testing for all of its refrigerated products at its other facilities. \"In the investigation, we're also calling on independent experts, on top of everything we're doing with health authorities to get to the bottom of the cause of the contamination,\" Jennifer Vincent said in an interview Wednesday. A timeline of the outbreak on the federal health agency's website states the first case was reported in August 2023, followed by a second in September and third in December. Then, a surge of nine cases came in June, and eight more in July of this year. Symptoms of a Listeria infection can take 70 days to emerge, making these type of outbreaks particularly difficult to identify quickly, says Lawrence Goodridge, a professor and Canada research chair in foodborne pathogen dynamics at the University of Guelph. “At that point, people can’t remember what they ate or when they ate it,” says Goodridge. The recalled products include Silk almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk, oat milk and almond-cashew milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk with best before dates up to and including Oct. 4 and containing 7825 in the product code. Unlike deli meats or unpasteurized cheese — food items more commonly associated with Listeria — a plant-based product might not have been on anyone's radar, says Burrows. “To have it in a beverage is unusual and to have it in a plant-based beverage is unusual because people have it in their mind that those are healthy alternatives,” Burrows adds. Goodridge agrees, noting: \"As far as I've known, this is the first time almond milk has been associated with Listeria or any foodborne outbreak for that matter.\" Vincent says Silk's refrigerated plant-based beverages are back on retail shelves after other facilities ramped up production. \"We're still undergoing the investigation. We're obviously very saddened that this happened. We're sorry that this happened.\" Canadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

    "text": "El Partido Revolucionario Institucional ha sido, es y seguirá siendo una fuerza indispensable en la construcción de nuestro país. Dentro de nuestro instituto político el órgano máximo de deliberación es la Asamblea Nacional, en el que existe un riguroso proceso para escuchar a todas las voces y en el que se garantiza la participación de toda la militancia. Se realizaron más de 500 asambleas municipales, en los 32 Estados de la República Mexicana y también en cada Sector y Organización del Partido, para discutir y dar sus propuestas que fueron integradas en un predictamen donde las y los delegados de las Mesas Nacionales Temáticas discutieron y aprobaron. La XXIV Asamblea Nacional no es un espacio improvisado, es el proceso de conversación y definiciones más importantes del partido. El pasado domingo asistimos más de tres mil 200 priistas de todo el país y por mayoría cada uno de los asambleístas votó las reportas y los cambios propuestos en la Declaración de Principios, Programa de Acción, Código de Ética y a los Estatutos del Revolucionario Institucional. Este proceso nos permitió dar pasos decisivos para fortalecer nuestra institución, es un momento de renovación y de definiciones para marcar la ruta ideológica y defender las causas que necesita nuestra nación. El PRI y su aguerrida militancia luchará para ser la oposición que México necesita. Una oposición contundente, potente y protagonista de los grandes debates nacionales. También durante la 24 Asamblea Nacional del Partido Revolucionario Institucional se aprobó que el 60% de las candidaturas sean para mujeres, fuimos el partido que elevó la paridad a rango constitucional y seguiremos impulsando a las mujeres para que tengan una mayor representación en los cargos de elección popular y así podamos erradicar la desigualdad y violencia hacia las mujeres. Además impulsamos la creación de la Secretaría de Innovación Tecnológica y Digital, la Secretaría de la Diversidad Sexual y el Centro de Estudios para la Discusión, Análisis y Prospectiva de México que tendrá la importante tarea de hacer una profunda reflexión de nuestro país, sus causas y necesidades para que en un contacto permanente con la ciudadanía podamos abanderar las luchas de nuestra patria. El PRI trabajará incansablemente por una justa distribución de la riqueza, para seguir combatiendo la desigualdad social y erradicar la pobreza. El lema del PRI es democracia y justicia social, por ello la lucha del PRI será la importante tarea de apoyar e impulsar la política social que promueva el desarrollo y progreso de todas y todos los mexicanos. Estos cambios no sólo fortalecen al PRI, sino que también reafirman nuestro compromiso social con México. Somos un partido que ha sabido adaptarse, evolucionar y revolucionar con el objetivo de alcanzar bienestar de nuestra nación. Continuaremos trabajando por un México justo, equitativo y próspero.

    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 29 (APP): The National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) on Friday temporarily sealed off the M14 motorway stretching from the Indus River to Yarik due to dense fog. The Motorway Police, taking proactive measures, aimed to avert potential accidents and safeguard the lives and belongings of motorway users, a public relations officer said while talking to APP. As the mist engulfs the thoroughfare, citizens are urged to exercise caution and limit unnecessary travel during foggy hours and a comprehensive guide issued by the Motorway Police to help navigate through the blanket of fog safely. To mitigate risks during this weather phenomenon, the Motorway Police advises citizens to conclude their journeys before the fog descends and daylight fades. This precautionary measure is pivotal in ensuring visibility on the road, reducing the likelihood of mishaps, he added. One of the key recommendations from the Motorway Police is the use of fog lights in vehicles. These specialized lights are designed to cut through the mist, providing enhanced visibility for drivers and minimizing the chances of collisions. Implementing this simple yet effective measure can make a significant difference in navigating through the fog-laden motorway. Drivers are reminded to avoid speeding and maintain a reasonable distance from the vehicle ahead. The reduced visibility demands a cautious approach, and adhering to speed limits can be the differentiator between a safe journey and a potential accident. Keeping a safe distance ensures adequate reaction time, allowing drivers to respond to unexpected situations promptly. NHMP authorities said that for real-time updates and information, the Motorway Police Helpline (130) is readily available for commuters. Before embarking on a journey, it’s advisable to seek the latest updates on road conditions, closures, and visibility from this helpline. Additionally, citizens can stay connected through the official social media accounts of the National Highways and Motorway Police for instant updates on the evolving situation. As the M14 motorway grapples with a veil of fog, the Motorway Police encourage responsible driving practices and urge citizens to prioritize safety. By adhering to these guidelines and staying informed through official channels, commuters can navigate through the misty challenges, ensuring a secure and uneventful journey on the motorway.",
