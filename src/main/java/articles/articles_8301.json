    "text": "A former soldier who stole a T-56 weapon from a constable who was on duty at the Wilgamuwa Police Station’s guard room was arrested in Aralaganwila.\nHe is a 36-year-old soldier who had been legally discharged from the Army and is a resident of Nugagolla, Wilgamuwa. The suspect was arrested while hiding at his wife’s aunt’s house in Aralaganwila.\n“I was very angry with the Police that day. I went to the junction, bought and drank four cans of beer to quench that anger. It was only when I was coming home on my bike late at night that I saw the Policeman at the guard house sleeping. I went a short distance on the bike and stopped at a place on the road and then went back and stole the weapon. After that, I ran and got on my bike and went home and threw the weapon in the well. It was only when I got up in the morning that I realised the seriousness of what I had done. At that time, I was very scared, so I took my wife and children and went to my ancestral home in Galgamuwa,”the suspect told Police during questioning.\n“The Police did not allow me to run my hooch business freely. I have 50 illicit liquor cases against me. Police came to arrest me on the 25 as well. I saved the sugar and escaped into the forest. But the yeast was discovered by the Police. As the 51st Kasippu case was also filed, I felt anger towards the Police. Thinking that I should do something about this, I went to the bar in the town and bought four cans of beer and while drinking it, arrived Police early in the morning. Then I saw the Police officer who was in the guardhouse sleeping soundly with his T-56 weapon by the side. I sneaked through the fence and took the weapon and ran away,” the suspect who was arrested on Wednesday (24) for stealing the firearm said during Police interrogations. He had then escaped from the house in Galgamuwa, subsequent to Police visiting the house.\n“I thought that when the Police found the weapon, they would stop looking for me. That is why I took the weapon out of the well and kept it near the Buddha statue,” he had told the Police.",

    "text": "NORTHIRON Church hosts 4th annual Serve Day MARQUETTE, Mich. (WLUC) - Volunteers cleared bushes for the fourth annual NORTHIRON Church Serve Day on Sunday. Instead of a Sunday service, members helped local organizations. The church expected close to 400 people at four different locations. A team of four families cleaned up the Marquette Women’s Center parking lot. Serve Day Team Leader Kyle Monroe said the Women’s Center has tried to get someone to clear it before, but plans fell through. Kids handled smaller tasks like clearing sticks and dusting. Monroe hoped to serve the community as best as they could. “It’s just a beautiful place to live, and we need to keep it that way,” Monroe said. “And if we don’t serve, there’s just too much work to be done.” Another team planted new flowers for a Marquette City flower planter. The team of three pulled weeds and added new compost. “The church is not just a building, it’s the people inside of it,” Serve Day Team Leader Lauren Spranger said. “So, we’re taking the people inside the church, and hopefully, we’re always giving back to the community, but we’re taking a day to do it.” Spranger hopes to be part of Serve Day next year.

    "title": "Former Georgia star earns highest PFF grade among all NFL rookie safeties following Week 2 performance",
    "text": "By Kelsey Kramer ,\n2 hours ago\nFormer Bulldogs Georgia star safety Javon Bullard is transitioning well at the NFL level.\nAs a rookie starter for the Green Bay Packers, Bullard has been credited with 12 total tackles and one pass breakup through two weeks so far. He's also allowed just three receptions and has missed one tackle.\nFollowing his Week 2 performance against the Indianapolis Colts where he logged five tackles and a pass breakup, Pro Football Focus gave him a grade of 78.3 -- the highest of any rookie safety from that week.\nBullard, a two-time national champion at Georgia, went 58th overall to the Packers back in April.\nHe entered the NFL fresh off a 2023 season with the Dawgs where he did not allow a single touchdown and forced seven incompletions.\nAt 5-foot-11 and 198 pounds, Bullard is a lot smaller than your average NFL safety, but his size hasn't stopped him from making those physical plays.\nGeorgia head coach Kirby Smart once referred to him as a \"little stick of dynamite\" and \"fearless\" after he posted a two-sack performance against the Tennessee Vols during the 2022 season.\n“He’s like a little stick of dynamite,\" Smart said.\"...He’s physical and he’s passionate about playing the game.”\nIt was after that same game that Smart explained exactly what it was Georiga saw in the former 3-star undersized prospect from Milledgeville, GA when they were recruiting him back in 2021.\n\"His film showed the toughness, he tackled well,” Smart said. “You can tell people who run through tackles don’t fear contact, and he was a fearless player.\"",

    "title": "Jamun: Jamun: The Indigenous Fruit of Lutyens’ New Delhi | Delhi News - Times of India",
    "text": "New Delhi: In the heart of the national capital, Gaurav Singh, all of 12 years, wakes up at dawn to fulfil a crucial task for his family. He rushes to the jamun trees near Ashoka Road and India Gate, plucking the fruits that his family will later sell by the roadside under the shade of the same trees. As the city’s demographics and the nameplates of the grand Lutyens’s bungalows change over time, these oval and ovoid berries and their hawkers remain a constant on Ashoka Road.The humble indigenous subtropical fruit of jamun, which ripens during the hottest part of summer just before the monsoon, holds cultural significance and is now at its peak in the city. This tangy and sweet seasonal fruit evokes nostalgia for some, while others view it as a rustic fruit ripe for experimentation. For many families who have been selling jamun in Central Delhi for years, it remains their bread and butter.Gaurav says: “The trees at Ashoka Road, barring a few, do not fruit that well and the berries are generally smaller. They are also very difficult to climb. However, those at India Gate still bear good fruit-size. Since the guards posted there won’t let us pass, we go at dawn when the security is not so tight. Later, these are mixed with the ones we get from the wholesale market.” He runs across the busy road to deliver the packs to buyers “who come in big cars”.Commuters often stop by these Central Delhi roads to purchase the purple eye candies. The sellers select the berries of their choice and smear them with black salt before handing them over to customers. Gaurav's mother, Phoolo Devi, does not support her son climbing trees to pluck the fruits and would prefer him to attend school instead.“We have been trying to send him and his younger brother to school, but they keep refusing. They insist that they would stay and help with earnings. We live by the road on the footpath, but don't want these kids to continue living like this,” she says, describing how the darkest purple berries are the sweetest, while those with light edges are tangy and have a longer aftertaste.Devi notes that people have their own preferences when it comes to jamun. Some customers are indifferent, while others meticulously handpick each berry. The selling continues from morning until evening. Another hawker, Rajkumar, says that they procure jamun from the mandi, but children also gather some from the trees near India Gate. The berries are mixed and sold by weight, with 250gm priced at Rs 50. High-quality, sorted jamuns that are the most purple cost Rs 300 per box.Until 2006, New Delhi Municipal Council auctioned the roughly 500 trees around India Gate and the current site of Central Vista for fruit plucking. Later, the responsibility was handed over to Central Public Works Department. Some trees were compromised during the ambitious Central Vista project and, last year, the auction reportedly had no takers.Planted around 1920, the remaining trees still attract birds like parakeets and Indian grey hornbills. As summer progresses, the jamun turns purple, enticing humans as well. This fruit, known by various names such as java plum, black plum and Indian blackberry, is believed to be underrated and underexploited despite its numerous qualities. One of its names, \\\"jambul,\\\" also serves as an ancient geographical marker, referring to the region as Jambudweep, where jamun trees are found and recited before most auspicious Hindu rituals.According to Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture, the fruit's pharmacological properties, including hypoglycemic, diuretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiplaque, antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, antioxidant, gastro-protective and astringent effects, have been proven in animal systems. Ayurveda praises jamun for its role in diabetes management.Faiyaz Khudsar, a senior biodiversity scientist, says: “To those who understand Delhi, jamun trees have a site-specific identity that resonates with India Gate and the surrounding areas. It's indigenous, linked with monsoon, and packs great nutritious value, offering to make up for the necessary nutrition at a time when there are few fruits in the market. Yet, it largely remains under-utilised.”The jamun, an evergreen canopy tree, will continue to work for Delhi, providing the city with much-needed green cover, shelter for birds and working on its fruiting process that takes 12 months to mature. For people like Phoolo, Rajkumar and Gaurav, a humble life will continue to return with this humble fruit next summer.",

    "text": "Greensky Hill bids farewell to the Rev. Mays and welcomes Pastor Sheaffer CHARLEVOIX — At 10 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 31, the community is invited to welcome Greensky Hill's new pastor, Sarah Dominic Sheaffer, and bid farewell to the Rev. Jonathan David Mays, who has served the congregation for the last decade. The congregation will celebrate this important transition on the Sunday after Christmas with the conclusion of the series, \"The Gift of Being Present.\" Week 5: \"Being Present with Assurance,\" featuring Advent candle lighting, carols, and prayers in Anishinaabemowin and English, music with The Drum Voices of Greensky Hill, worship pastor Sharon Osterhouse, and others, a reflection on the First Nations Version of Luke 2:22-40 by the Rev. Jonathan Mays, a video by The Work of the People, and a \"Passing of the Mantle\" ceremony welcoming Pastor Sarah. Series creator Worship Design Studio notes: \"The overwhelming message of the Christmas story is the assurance that we, too, are children of the Holy One. In this, our very presence is a gift if we will only allow the Spirit to move in and through us. Every day of our ordinary lives, we can show up — be present — and proclaim the assurance of hope, peace, joy and love to those who need it most.\" Rev. Mays expressed his gratitude to the congregation and community. \"I am so incredibly thankful for my 10 1/2 years at Greensky Hill. I can't imagine a more gracious community or sacred place with such a rich history and promise,\" Rev. Mays said. \"Our founding Native pastor, Peter Greensky, and ancestors would be so proud of what this congregation has accomplished in its 190-year ministry and Greensky Hill's ministry priorities of being radically welcoming to all people, the Greening of Greensky Hill with a Sacred Spaces Clean Energy grant and a Solar Faithful solar panel installation, and the creation of the Greensky Hill Anishinaabe Conservancy to preserve and protect the land forever. It's the perfect time for me to retire and Pastor Sarah, as an LTBB citizen with deep community connections, is the right leader at the right time.\" All are welcome every Sunday at 10 a.m. at 8484 Greensky Hill Road in Charlevoix and [online](https://www.facebook.com/groups/173854422675352/).
