    "text": "Technically, you can buy this rally-spec Toyota GR Yaris race car\nWe’ve heard a lot of people say that the Toyota GR Yaris is a rally car for the road. In some ways, we agree with that sentiment as it has all the ingredients that make it so.\nWith its all-wheel drive, smart differential, and a boosted engine, the GR Yaris can be a weapon on the circuit and on rally stages. However, if you want the one that’s being used for the World Rally Championship, you can’t exactly show up to your nearest Toyota dealership and get one.\nOTHER STORIES YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED:\n5 JDM legends that turn 25 in ’24\nPenalties from anti-colorum ops amounted to a whopping P20.8-M in December 2023 alone\nToyota GR Yaris Rally2 side view\nPHOTO BY Toyota\nIt doesn’t mean you can’t buy the rally-spec car. Provided you have deep pockets, there’s the Toyota GR Yaris Rally2 racer. What is it, you ask? It’s essentially a ‘milder’ version of the WRC version that’s made for privateers and customer racing teams.\nThe GR Yaris Rally2 is as close as you can get to Kalle Rovanperä’s Rally1 car. Rally2 cars don’t pack as much power and torque as the Rally1 racers with engines limited to 285hp (Rally1 cars have close to 500hp). These cars also don’t have the Rally1 car’s hybrid system and e-boost.\nToyota GR Yaris Rally2 shakedown\nPHOTO BY Toyota\nStill, the specs are impressive. It uses the same engine block as the road-going model, but its 1.6-liter, turbocharged three-cylinder gets further reinforcements to handle the extra power and torque. Unlike the road car, this one uses a five-speed sequential transmission.\nHelping it turn in quicker is a mechanical limited slip differential. The massive 300mm brake rotors (355mm for tarmac stages) take care of shaving off speed.\nToyota GR Yaris Rally2 front view\nPHOTO BY Toyota\nHow much is it; you ask? Toyota isn’t mentioning any prices. However, most Rally2 race cars appear to hover around the €200,000 mark, approximately P12,500,000 at current conversion costs. It ain’t cheap, but it’s a lot less compared to the Rally1 cars that easily cost over twice as much.",

    "text": "The sustainability of Crystal Lagoons technology was a determining factor for this agreement, the second with Romanian property developer Forty Management. MIAMI – [Crystal Lagoons](https://www.traveldailynews.com/tag/crystal-lagoons/) continues to conquer iconic cities in Europe. Having already launched in Prague, Warsaw, Bucharest, and Budapest, the company is now bringing beach life to Rome, Milan, Toulouse, Seville, and two additional Romanian cities. These Mediterranean cities will now also benefit from Public Access Lagoons projects, known as PAL. In this way, this innovation multinational company, founded by scientist Fernando Fischmann, is expanding to Italy and France and adding projects in Spain and Romania, where it already has successful complexes such as Santa Rosalía, Alcazaba Lagoon, and Central District Lagoon City. The sustainability of Crystal Lagoons technology was once again a determining factor for this agreement, the second with Forty Management, a prestigious and award-winning Romanian property developer with which the multinational has complexes in the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, characterized by their sustainability. The introduction of PAL projects into touristic and landmark cities like Rome and Milan demonstrates their added value, and the appeal of bringing an idyllic beach life just steps from homes. The central piece will be a large crystalline lagoon suitable for swimming and water sports, surrounded by white sandy beaches, which anyone can access for an entrance fee. The complex will be surrounded by residential areas, hotels, stores, restaurants, and other high-end commercial and entertainment infrastructure. “We are delighted that Crystal Lagoons, one of the world’s most innovative companies, has chosen Forty Management to expand into Europe. In partnership, we will bring beach life to the most amazing European cities and improve the quality of life through sustainable projects,” said Lucian Azoiței, CEO of Forty Management. “The disruptive innovation of Crystal Lagoons technology, which allows bringing beach life in a sustainable way to any place in the world, is what generates the success of these crystalline lagoons. This has been recognized by avant-garde developers like Forty Management who, after confirming the trend in their first complex, repeat the model to develop new projects, even in cities that would be unthinkable like Rome, Milan or Toulouse,” said Jean Pierre Juanchich, Global Business Director of Crystal Lagoons.

    "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Rank and file police in Burlington says there is a lack of support from city leadership. The police union says the lack of political support directly correlates with the department’s struggle to recruit new officers.\nThe Burlington Police Officers’ Association is airing its concerns when it comes to the public perception of law enforcement in the Queen City.\nIn a letter sent to the Burlington City Council, union officials are calling on city leaders to speak out. “We’re losing more officers than we’re gaining and that is obviously not sustainable,” said City Councilor Joan Shannon, D-South.\nThe department is currently operating with about two-thirds of the officers it had five years ago. The union blames it on the political climate that has existed since Progressives on the council voted in 2020 to defund the force by 30 percent.\nIn a two-page letter sent to city councilors, the association says they polled new recruits at the Vermont Police Academy and that 17 said they lived in Chittenden County. But when asked if they applied to Burlington... “None of them had -- which was really concerning. And they dug a little bit deeper and asked them why. And the answer was they didn’t feel that they would be supported,” Shannon said.\nThe letter says “...the perception of the city, the City Council, and the mayor’s office is a major deterrent for people who live in the area and want to pursue law enforcement careers to serve their local communities.”\nRelated Stories: Burlington mayor meets with business leaders to address public safety concerns Dozens turn out for Burlington public safety forum Burlington City Council to address public safety position for library ‘Public safety hub’ could increase police presence in downtown Burlington Since the 2020 vote, the council has reversed course on staffing levels and Progressive Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney Stanak notes that the city has made significant investments in the department. “It included investing $100,000 in addition to what we already spend on recruitment strategies for just the police department. It includes investing in both the police and fire and increasing those operational budgets when every other budget in the city was capped and was not allowed to grow -- and froze positions in order to do so,” she said.\nBut so far those efforts have done little to rebuild the force. The current class at the academy class had four Burlington Police recruits, but that number has now dropped to two. There was only one in the last class.\nThis also comes as Burlington voters consider a proposed charter change that would give the police commission the power to investigate officer misconduct -- and override the chief’s findings. Chief Jon Murad last week expressed concerns that the measure would hurt morale and recruitment efforts even more.\nCopyright 2024 WCAX. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "The Perilous Plate: Can You Eat Checkered Pufferfish? The short answer? Absolutely not, you should not eat checkered pufferfish. While the allure of exotic cuisine and culinary adventure might tempt some, consuming checkered pufferfish, like many of its pufferfish cousins, poses a significant health risk due to the presence of potent toxins, primarily tetrodotoxin (TTX) and, in some cases, saxitoxin (STX) . These toxins can lead to severe neurological symptoms, paralysis, and even death. Let’s dive into the details and explore the dangers surrounding this potentially deadly delicacy.\nThe Toxin Tango: Understanding the Risks Pufferfish, also known as fugu in Japan, have gained notoriety for their poisonous nature. The toxicity stems from the accumulation of TTX and STX, concentrated in organs like the liver, ovaries, and skin . While some species have edible flesh when prepared meticulously by trained professionals, the checkered puffer ( Sphoeroides testudineus ) is generally considered too risky for consumption.\nThe level of toxicity can vary depending on the species, geographic location, and even the time of year. Checkered puffers found in Florida waters, for example, have been shown to contain STX, adding another layer of danger. Remember, cooking does not destroy these toxins . Heating TTX and STX will not neutralize them, making proper preparation absolutely critical. Even a minute amount of toxin can be lethal to an adult human.\nThe symptoms of pufferfish poisoning can appear rapidly, often within 20 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. These symptoms can include:\nTingling or numbness around the mouth and fingertips Muscle weakness and paralysis Gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) Difficulty breathing Cardiac arrhythmias Seizures Death There is currently no known antidote for tetrodotoxin poisoning. Treatment focuses on supportive care, such as assisted ventilation and managing cardiac symptoms. The severity of the poisoning depends on the amount of toxin ingested and the individual’s overall health.\nWhy the Risk Isn’t Worth the Reward While skilled chefs in Japan are licensed to prepare certain species of pufferfish, minimizing the risk of poisoning, the process is extremely complex and requires extensive training. The removal of toxic organs must be precise, and even then, there is no guarantee of complete safety. The question then becomes: is the potential reward worth the extreme risk? For checkered pufferfish, the answer is a resounding no. There are many other delicious and safe seafood options available that don’t carry the threat of paralysis or death.\nThe Allure of Fugu: A Cultural Perspective The consumption of pufferfish is deeply ingrained in Japanese culinary culture. Despite the inherent dangers, fugu is considered a delicacy, prized for its unique flavor and texture. In Japan, specially trained and licensed chefs undergo rigorous training to learn how to safely prepare fugu. This includes understanding the anatomy of the fish, knowing which parts are toxic, and mastering the techniques to remove those parts without contaminating the edible flesh. The process is regulated by strict government standards, and chefs are held accountable for any instances of poisoning. The meticulous preparation and the inherent risk contribute to the allure and exclusivity of fugu. The Environmental Literacy Council provides more resources on understanding human interaction with the environment.\nCheckered Pufferfish: A Closer Look The checkered pufferfish, Sphoeroides testudineus , is a common species found in estuarine habitats of the Western Atlantic. They are characterized by their distinctive checkered pattern, with dark brown upper bodies marked by pale yellowish lines. These fish are relatively small, typically reaching a maximum size of 30 cm. Checkered puffers play an important role in their ecosystems as predators, feeding primarily on invertebrates such as gastropods, bivalves, and crabs. They are often caught as bycatch in fisheries, but their consumption is strongly discouraged due to their potential toxicity.\nFAQs: Unraveling the Pufferfish Puzzle Here are some frequently asked questions to shed more light on the topic of pufferfish and their toxicity:\n1. Are all pufferfish poisonous? No, not all pufferfish are equally poisonous. The level of toxicity varies depending on the species. Some species contain very high levels of TTX, while others may have lower concentrations or even be considered non-toxic in their flesh, although even these may have toxic skin and organs.\n2. Can you cook the poison out of pufferfish? No, cooking does not destroy tetrodotoxin . It is a heat-stable toxin, meaning it will remain toxic even after being exposed to high temperatures.\n3. Is it safe to touch a pufferfish? While touching the outside of a pufferfish isn’t generally considered dangerous (unless you have open wounds), it’s best to avoid it. Especially when the fish is puffed up. They contain tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin found in their organs. This toxin can be deadly to humans if ingested or if it comes into contact with open wounds.\n4. What parts of the pufferfish are poisonous? The most poisonous parts of the pufferfish are the liver, ovaries, skin, and intestines . The muscles, while potentially edible in some species, can also be contaminated if not prepared correctly.\n5. Is fugu legal in the United States? Yes, but with strict regulations. Only licensed chefs who have undergone specific training are permitted to prepare and serve fugu in the U.S. The fish must be imported from specific sources that meet FDA standards.\n6. What happens if you eat poisonous pufferfish? Eating poisonous pufferfish can lead to tetrodotoxin poisoning , causing symptoms such as numbness, paralysis, difficulty breathing, and potentially death.\n7. How much tetrodotoxin is lethal? As little as 0.002 grams of tetrodotoxin can be fatal to an adult human . This highlights the extreme potency of the toxin.\n8. Why is pufferfish considered a delicacy? Despite the risks, pufferfish is considered a delicacy due to its unique flavor and texture . Some describe the taste as subtle and slightly sweet, with a firm, chewy consistency.\n9. Are there any pufferfish that are not poisonous? The Northern Puffer ( Sphoeroides maculatus ) is considered less toxic than other species, with its flesh generally regarded as safe to eat. However, some scientists believe low-level toxins may still be present in the skin and organs, so caution is still advised.\n10. How do chefs safely prepare pufferfish? Licensed fugu chefs use specialized knives and techniques to carefully remove the toxic organs without contaminating the edible flesh. They must undergo years of training and pass rigorous examinations to obtain their license.\n11. What is the treatment for tetrodotoxin poisoning? Unfortunately, there is no antidote for tetrodotoxin poisoning . Treatment focuses on supportive care, such as maintaining airway and breathing, managing blood pressure, and preventing secondary complications.\n12. Are spotted pufferfish aggressive? Spotted pufferfish can be aggressive , especially as they mature. They are known to be fin nippers and may not be suitable tankmates for all fish species.\n13. What do checkered puffers eat? Checkered puffers primarily feed on invertebrates , including gastropods, bivalves, and crabs. Their diet can also include amphipods, isopods, hermit crabs, and other small organisms.\n14. How big do checkered pufferfish get? Checkered pufferfish typically grow to a maximum size of around 30 centimeters (12 inches) .\n15. Where can I learn more about the dangers of consuming poisonous fish? Reliable sources of information include the FDA, the CDC, and academic institutions specializing in marine biology and toxicology. Additionally, enviroliteracy.org offers valuable insights into environmental health and related issues.\nConclusion: Steering Clear of the Checkered Puffer The allure of exotic cuisine can be tempting, but when it comes to checkered pufferfish, the risks far outweigh any potential rewards. The presence of potent toxins, the lack of an antidote, and the complexity of safe preparation make this fish a dangerous choice for consumption. It’s best to leave the preparation of pufferfish to highly trained and licensed professionals, and even then, exercise caution. When it comes to your health, it’s always better to err on the side of safety.",
