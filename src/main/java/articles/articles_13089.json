Listen to Story In Short - Curiosity has been exploring a sulfate-rich region of Mars - The sulfur crystals were found in the Gediz Vallis channel - This discovery has important implications for understanding Mars' geology Nasa's Curiosity rover has made a groundbreaking discovery on Mars, uncovering rocks composed of a mysterious crystals. These crystals, analysis reveled, are pure sulfur - a [first of its kind discovery on the Red Planet. ](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/new-study-adds-twist-to-martian-story-it-could-have-been-a-cold-frigid-world-2565200-2024-07-11) On May 30, 2024, the rover inadvertently cracked open a rock, revealing vibrant yellow sulfur crystals that have never been observed on Mars before. Since October 2023, Curiosity has been exploring a sulfate-rich region of Mars. While sulfates have been previously detected, they were always found as part of sulfur-based minerals. This recent discovery marks the first time elemental, or pure, sulfur has been identified on the planet. Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, likened the discovery to \"finding an oasis in the desert,\" emphasizing its unexpected nature and the need for further explanation. The sulfur crystals were found in the Gediz Vallis channel, an area of significant geological interest on Mount Sharp. Scientists believe this channel was formed by ancient water flows and debris, providing valuable insights into [ Mars' past environmental conditions.](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/when-a-bouncing-spacecraft-came-hurtling-down-on-mars-in-july-1997-2563873-2024-07-08) This discovery has important implications for understanding Mars' geological history and potential for supporting life. While sulfur itself is not direct evidence of life, its presence can offer clues about past environmental conditions that might have been conducive to microbial life. The Curiosity rover has been exploring Mount Sharp for over seven years, studying its layers to understand when and where Mars might have had conditions suitable for microbial life. The recent findings in the Gediz Vallis channel suggest a complex history [involving both water flows and landslides.](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/why-nasa-sent-four-people-on-a-year-long-mission-to-artificial-mars-2563643-2024-07-08) On June 18, Curiosity drilled its 41st hole in a nearby rock nicknamed \"Mammoth Lakes.\" The powderized samples collected are being analyzed to determine their composition, potentially offering more insights into Mars' puzzling geological past. As Curiosity continues its exploration, each new discovery brings us closer to [unraveling the mysteries of the Red Planet](https://www.indiatoday.in/visualstories/science/why-is-mars-red-the-answer-lies-in-hidden-rust-149442-05-07-2024) and answering the fundamental question of whether Mars ever harbored life.",

    "title": "From farmland to Big Five sanctuary: The evolution of Dinokeng Game Reserve",
    "text": "Twenty years ago, Dinokeng Game Reserve was a savanna and grassland area owned by livestock and crop farmers about 30 minutes’ drive north-east of Gauteng. It adjoins Hammanskraal, a sprawling township with a population of more than 120 000.\nToday, it is a 21 000-hectare Big Five game reserve, bigger than private game reserves such as Sabi Sabi (5 400ha) and MalaMala (12 000ha), but less than half the size of Pilanesberg National Park (55 000ha) in North West and just 1% of the size of the two million hectare Kruger National Park.\nIt is the result of a unique collaboration between about 180 private landowners — their plots covering about 21ha each — and Blue IQ, a government-backed management company and, now, the department of economic development, through Dinokeng Projects.\nThis public-private partnership took shape in the early 2000s, culminating in the declaration of the Dinokeng Game Reserve in 2011.\nOverall, it has been a success, making a significant contribution to the province’s biodiversity credits (financial instruments designed to offset the loss of biodiversity caused by mining, construction and agriculture).\nIt offers not only Big Five tourism in Gauteng but jobs for many from Hammanskraal and the greater Dinokeng area, which includes the mining town of Cullinan, where employment opportunities will become even more scarce as mining operations decline, and the Roodeplaat Dam area.\nThe 80 lodges in the reserve employ 800 to 1 000 staff, mostly from these areas.\nNot least, it has become a model — albeit flawed by controversial turns such as the alleged mismanagement of two elephants and criticism over euthanising a lion after it broke out and killed a woman in 2018 — for conservation where people and wild animals can live in close proximity.\nThe reserve is the only residential Big Five game reserve in the world within the boundaries of a metro.\nBut there are specific difficulties inherent in a collaboration with private landowners and being close to a large peri-urban area.\nPrimary among them is the need to expand the reserve to at least 40 000ha to make it self-sustaining and to get more farmers to drop their fences so the animals can roam more freely. Joined-up landscapes support healthy ecosystems, ensuring genetic diversity and seasonal migration routes for the animals.\n“We still have islands of landowners who are fenced off from the reserve, so it is a work in progress.\n“Another 964ha belonging to Gauteng department of public works is to join Dinokeng and we are in discussions with the SA army to incorporate another 12 000ha of their land,” says Hartogh Streicher, chairperson of the reserve.\nThe reserve is in the process of getting the area proclaimed under the Protected Areas Act, Streicher says, with 90% of the landowners in favour of this move.\n“Once the area is proclaimed, the property prices will probably increase, having already risen dramatically over the last 13 years. It offers a great lifestyle to the conservation-minded, including foreign-national investors,” he says.\nPoaching and snaring are the more immediate problems in Dinokeng, and a big portion of its budget goes into mitigating these threats.\nSnares are prolific — 230 were removed during the month of March, about 1 000 are found each year and 112 animals have been killed in the past three years.\nTeaching people in the surrounding areas about the importance of conservation is a continuing priority for the reserve’s management team, Streicher says.\nBoth snaring and poaching have been reduced because of the efforts of the 16-strong Dinokeng anti-poaching unit, supported by surveillance drones operated by a Spots (strategic protection of threatened species) team.\n“In the five months until May, we’ve had four impala killed by snares. And we’ve had only three rhino-poaching incidents in 13 years,” says Streicher.\nA big deterrent to rhino poaching is satellite-linked tracker devices inserted into the horns of each rhino, so the monitoring teams always know where the animal is, and if its horns are poached, these can be located.\nThere are 24 elephants in the reserve, and most of them are collared, also at significant expense — an elephant collar costs about R35 000, excluding helicopter, darting and vet fees.\nAgain, the collars provide critical, real-time data, so rangers can herd the animals away if they wander too close to populated areas or see what is happening if it hasn’t moved.\nTo offset some of this expense, the reserve offers 10 seats on the collaring excursions to the public at R2 000.\nBeing a smaller reserve, monitoring and management intervention is necessary to maintain healthy gene pools, balance predator and prey ratios and avoid overuse of the land.\nContraception to manage animal populations, and capturing big cats for exchange with other parks to avoid inbreeding, are a large part of the reserve’s operational budget.\nFor example, Dinokeng’s Black Rhino Project relocated 14 black rhinos from KwaZulu-Natal into the reserve recently, while 60 buffalo, four lions and 16 white rhino were bought from other reserves.\nCheetahs are fitted with GPS satellite collars, which cost about R50 000 each.\nThe first cheetah was introduced in 2012, and today the reserve has 21, contributing to the metapopulation throughout Africa through the Endangered Wildlife Trust Cheetah Metapopulation Project, which aims to prevent inbreeding and ensure the long-term viability of cheetahs in small, fenced reserves.\nThe cheetah is the second-most threatened carnivore in South Africa, after the African wild dog.\nGovernment-funded teams control fire outbreaks, maintain the road network (there are more than 140km of winding tracks in Dinokeng) and clear away invasive species.\nRaising money is a never-ending, critical mission if the reserve is to survive, says Streicher.\n“You can spend R10 million just on upgrading the [160km] perimeter fence,” he says.\nControversially, the reserve is occasionally paid R10 000 to R130 000 by hunters to shoot selected animals deemed to be expendable because of being past their breeding age. These are mainly buffalo, of which the reserve has about 1 500 (one of the largest buffalo herds in the country).\nStreicher says that the selected animals would be culled anyway and the reserve needs the money.\n“We get about 20 hunts a year, and sell the byproducts of these animals, including biltong and droëwors, which are made into braai packs.\n“Remember, we are not a high-end reserve. Accommodation here is a third of the price it is in, say, the Kruger National Park. So, revenue from tourism — even though it has increased 10% yearly — is not enough to fund the running and management of the reserve.\n“There is no such thing as an ideal game reserve. You are constantly facing challenges and hard decisions, but if you look at this project over its lifetime, it is the realisation of a dream that seemed very remote at the beginning.\n“And it continues to grow as one of South Africa’s proudest biodiversity assets,” he says.\nAbandon trophy hunting\nIn its Reviewed National Biodiversity Economy Strategy (2024), the government promotes trophy hunting — especially of Big Five animals — as a way of generating wealth for conservation.\nBut there has been a strong pushback by NGOs, including Good Governance Africa, to the emphasis on benefiting humans at the cost of protecting wildlife for its own sake.\n“Trophy hunting, especially of charismatic endangered species, should be abandoned as a pillar of any national biodiversity strategy.\n“Its purported economic advantages do not bear up under scrutiny and its ecological costs are too high,” says Ross Harvey, natural resource economist and policy analyst and director of research and programmes at Good Governance Africa.\n“A more sustainable alternative is to build more non-consumptive activities — wildlife watching, birdwatching, photography — and better integrate local communities into ecotourism value chains.”\nBut Harvey also recognises that “small reserves face unique challenges, and it is encouraging that Dinokeng is actively pursuing expansion, which could in itself create alternatives to trophy hunting through higher-end tourism”.\nRead Good Governance Africa’s policy briefing on this issue here .\nThis article first appeared in Mail & Guardian.",

    "text": "This fast-growing country is taming inflation and in strong financial shape — and its stock market is calling\nOUTSIDE THE BOX\nFrom our recent travels around India, it appears that the world’s most populous country could be poised for long-term growth. An infrastructure boom is evident, government policies are making India an attractive destination for companies to uproot supply chains from China, and a digital transformation is revolutionizing access to credit.\nThe country also has seen relative political stability over the past 10 years, allowing economic development to be a top priority. Corporate confidence seems high, the economy is expanding at a decent clip and technological innovation is leading to new areas of growth.\nLack of infrastructure has been a major impediment to unlocking India’s true growth potential. On a recent trip to meet with companies, it was clear to us that the construction of infrastructure as well as more affordable housing are well underway. We traveled by car from Surat to Mumbai, a distance of 170 miles. Ten years ago, that trip would have taken 12 hours. We did it in six, driving on six-lane highways and stopping at several quality food establishments along the way. That was unheard of a decade ago.\nIn Mumbai, the skyline has transformed from 15 years ago. Dozens of buildings reach 50 or more floors, and a subway system is under construction. Residential housing is fast expanding. An example is the town of Palava, 20 miles from Mumbai’s central business district. It’s a master-planned community that reminds one of similar communities in China.\nAlmost all conversations we have with management teams start and end with corporate governance. As important as these developments are, as bottom-up investors who’ve been actively traveling to India since the late 1990s, we believe a diligent focus on corporate governance will be an important factor moving forward. This might not be fully captured if one seeks to gain exposure to India through a passive investment vehicle that tracks the broader index. (Passive funds do not strive to outpace their benchmarks; rather, they seek to track the benchmark’s return.)\nLet us explain. India has historically traded at a higher valuation on a relative price-to-earnings basis to other emerging markets. Based on our firm’s 30 years of investing in the country’s equity markets, we have found that corporate governance can be a powerful factor in driving valuation differentials within individual sectors. Most companies with strong governance have tended to be rewarded with much higher valuations, based on our experiences. For this reason, almost all conversations we have with management teams start and end with corporate governance.\nFace-to-face relationships matter. India has some of the smartest corporate managements in the world, but transparency is key to ensure majority shareholder interests align with ours. Company founders and their extended families are often majority shareholders in their companies — in some cases even after the companies have gone public.\nWhile our investment team has seen tremendous progress regarding governance standards in recent years, it isn’t always easy or a clear-cut decision. We have to triangulate information from our source networks to understand management team priorities. For instance, during our regular research trips we visit company plants multiple times. We talk to suppliers and customers. As an active manager, we invest in companies if they can help pursue a portfolio’s investment objective, not because it is held in an index.\nIndex construction often does not factor in management structure and pedigree or a company’s growth strategy. This is especially important in a developing market like India, where traditional Wall Street research that typically focuses on large cap companies (typically market capitalization of $10 billion or more) often leaves major gaps with reference to investment opportunities given that small- (typically market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion) and midcap (typically market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion) companies currently dominate the market landscape.\nExpect potential opportunities to increase, especially in the small-cap space. Consider that within the MSCI India Index there are very few Indian companies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion and just a handful that exceed $100 billion. Smaller companies, or those with a market value between $1 billion and $10 billion, make up almost half the index. And given the country’s economic growth — fueled by the steady buildout of both physical and digital infrastructure and an expanding middle class — we expect potential opportunities to increase, especially in the small-cap space.\nInvestors looking to take advantage of Indian small-caps can consider a actively managed mutual fund. For example, the fund we help manage, American Funds’ SMALLCAP World Fund SMCWX, leverages deep research into global companies under $6 billion in market capitalization at the time of purchase, including in India. HDFC Bank Kotak Mahindra Bank Tube Investments of India ] and Max Healthcare Institute are a few examples of current and former fund holdings as of last Sept. 30.\nWhat’s also attractive about India’s equity market today is the breadth of potential investments in finance, consumer businesses, manufacturing, real estate development and online technology platforms. This enables an active manager to build a diversified set of holdings across industries without necessarily concentrating risk in one area.\nThe fundamental outlook for India is arguably better than ever. The country has a lot going for it: It’s one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, inflation is under control, the government has been fiscally responsible and corruption is lower than it was a decade ago. The equity market is still relatively small compared to the size of the economy and its potential growth, making it a fertile hunting ground for an active portfolio manager.\nBrad Freer is an equity portfolio manager at Capital Group in Los Angeles. Freer has 30 years of investment industry experience and has been with Capital Group for 29 years. Earlier in his career at Capital, he was an equity investment analyst covering multiple sectors as a generalist in both India and Australia.\nAnirudha Dutta is a Mumbai-based India macro analyst at Capital Group. Dutta has 34 years of investment industry experience and has been with Capital Group for 11 years.\nMore: Emerging markets struggled in 2023.
