    "title": "Weretilneck reclama que Milei no activÃ³ la rotonda de Choele Choel por la que apoyÃ³ la ley bases",
    "text": "El gobernador Alberto Weretilneck mandÃ³ a la senadora MÃ³nica Silva a reclamarle a Vialidad Nacional que informe de manera urgente fecha de \"reinicio y finalizaciÃ³n de obra\" para la rotonda de Choele Choel, una de las condiciones que habrÃa puesto el mandatario provincial a fines de mayo para que la legisladora votara a favor de la Ley Bases. A dos meses de la sesiÃ³n del Senado que aprobÃ³ el proyecto parlamentario mÃ¡s importante de Javier Milei, Silva solicitÃ³ al Poder Ejecutivo \"que informe el plazo de 'reinicio' y 'cronograma' de finalizaciÃ³n urgente de la Obra de la Rotonda de la ciudad de Choele Choel, ubicada sobre la Ruta Nacional 22\". Fuentes cercanas a la ex ministra de EducaciÃ³n rionegrina explicaron que la obra quedÃ³ paralizada cuando acreditaba un avance del 60 por ciento, a raÃz de las restricciones dispuestas por el propio gobierno libertario. El problema es que, [tal como informÃ³ LPO](https://www.lapoliticaonline.com/congreso/acusan-a-weretilneck-de-canjear-el-voto-a-favor-de-la-senadora-silva-en-la-ley-omnibus-por-la-rotonda-de-choele-choel/), Silva comprometiÃ³ su acompaÃ±amiento a la Ley Bases a cambio de esa rotonda pero Milei no mandÃ³ ni una bolsa de cemento. En mayo pasado, la senadora celebrÃ³ por Twitter la reactivaciÃ³n de la obra. \"Tengo una muy buena noticia. Se reactivarÃ¡ la obra Rotonda sobre Ruta Nacional 22 frente a Choele Choel. @albertoweretilneck gestionÃ³ esta obra, que avanzÃ³ en un 60%. Ahora avanzarÃ¡ el 40% restante\", tipeÃ³. [Weretilneck canjeÃ³ el voto a la ley Ã³mnibus por una rotonda en Choele Choel](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=291047&s=6f085938a1ba162c8d817eda382865e8) En ese momento, Silva aclarÃ³ que la informaciÃ³n se la habÃa transmitido \"el administrador general de Vialidad Nacional\", RaÃºl Bertola, al tiempo que su entorno se encargÃ³ de aclarar que no canjeaba su voto a la ley por la rotonda. Por lo demÃ¡s, el gobernador de RÃo Negro festejÃ³ el beneficio de la construcciÃ³n de la planta de GNL en su provincia, luego de que la inversiÃ³n estuviera comprometida en la ciudad bonaerense de BahÃa Blanca pero Milei promoviera su traslado a la Patagonia por su disputa con Axel Kicillof. Este jueves Silva formalizÃ³ un Proyecto de ComunicaciÃ³n que firmÃ³ y presentÃ³ desde el Senado, mediante el expediente 1458/24, para tener precisiones sobre la construcciÃ³n paralizada en el marco de la suspensiÃ³n de la obra pÃºblica nacional. Otro de los puntos que pidiÃ³ que le aclaren fue el del \"costo total de la obra concluida\" y \"el plazo previsto de finalizaciÃ³n, en una obra muy querida, anhelada y necesaria para los vecinos de Choele Choel\". La importancia de la rotonda radica en que conecta con la Ruta 250, camino que utilizan tanto el trÃ¡nsito pesado procedente de BahÃa Blanca como los camiones frutÃcolas que se dirigen al Puerto de San Antonio.

    "text": "Five Rivers MetroParks and Wright State University have partnered to offer four presentations meant to inspire a sense of adventure in outdoor enthusiasts of all interests. The biennial Adventure Speaker Series begins on Wednesday, Feb. 5 and continues throughout the winter with local explorers covering such topics as climbing, travel, hiking and truck camping.\n“Many people dream of embarking on all kinds of adventures, some of which may seem unattainable,” said Chris Buck. “The Adventure Speaker Series is all about showcasing local explorers who made up their mind to just go for it and they share their experience so that others can get inspired to check things off their respective bucket lists.”\nThe Adventure Speaker Series talks are select Wednesdays from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Admission is free. The schedule is:\nAttempting North America’s Longest Sport Climbing Route\nSpeakers: Alex Petersen, Cedrick Gauthier and Eli Capasso\nWednesday, Feb. 5, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nIn the summer of 2024, friends and members of Wright State University’s Climbing Club ventured to Squamish, British Columbia, to attempt North America’s longest bolted sport climbing route: Guarantee Rugged. This 3,524-foot route includes considerable rock debris and scree, collections of unstable rock fragments.\nHear from the climbers as they recount their experiences climbing three distinct routes: the slabby lower apron, the headwall and the final ridge to the summit. The group will also discuss planning, logistics, techniques and their efforts to grow a local climbing community through education, support and advocacy.\nOne Year…One Quest – America’s 428 National Parks\nSpeaker: Tom Wright\nWednesday, Feb. 26, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nWright shares his quest to visit all 428 national parks in just one year and the exhilarating – and sometimes exhausting – travels across 50 states and four territories. Attendees will hear Wright’s best stories, learn how to follow in his footsteps and get a sneak peek at his new book, One Year…One Quest: A World Record Trek .\nIf Not Now…When?\nSpeakers: Uriah Langmeyer and Leolani Stanley\nWednesday, March 5, 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nPack up and go with speakers Langmeyer and Stanley, as they take attendees on their adventures step-by-step, from how to minimize your belongings to grabbing a one-way ticket (with a bit of planning) to see what happens. The couple share the different places they ended up during their travels, the projects they were a part of and what life is like living in different parts of the world.\nExtended Travel\nSpeakers: Mike and Dani Mortell\nWednesday, March 19, 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nThe Mortells take attendees on a truck camper adventure with their dog and cat, as they travel from Alaska to Guatemala and beyond. After Dani’s ongoing struggle with long COVID brought them back to the states, they opened a business in Yellow Springs where they sell the same Scout Campers that they lived in for more than two years on the road. They empower others to embark on their own adventures as they share their own experiences.\nMore information can be found on the Adventure Speaker Series webpage at www.theadventuresummit.com .",

    "text": "Washington: US President Joe Biden on Thursday said his deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, is “qualified” to lead the country.At a press conference here, Biden said, “From the very beginning, I made no bones about that. She is qualified to be the president. That's why I picked her.” When asked about the reasons for this, he said “Firstly because of the way she's handled the issue of freedom of women's bodies, to have control of their bodies and secondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board.” “This was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a first-rate person and in the Senate, she was really good. ,” Biden said.I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be the presidentThe president mistakenly referred to Kamala Harris as Donald Trump during the press conference. He said, “I wouldn't have picked Trump to be the vice president, did I think she was not qualified to be president….” “The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once and I will beat him again,” Biden said.“The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual. And I might add, at least five presidents were running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign,” he said.So, there's a long way to go in this campaign and so I'm just going to keep moving, he said.This report is auto-generated from PTI news service.
