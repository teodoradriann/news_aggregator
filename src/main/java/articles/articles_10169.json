    "text": "LEESBURG, Fla. - The reward to find 25-year-old Alez Lopez is growing. Lopez is accused of shooting and killing Raied Shihadeh. \"He was there working hard for his family,\" said Monique Shihadeh, Raied Shihadeh&apos;s wife \"And this scum of the earth came in and took him from us.\" It&apos;s been two weeks since Shihadeh was killed at his convenience store. Investigators say Lopez went into the store off Picciola Road, shot Shihadeh less than an hour before closing, and then robbed the store. \"If he had asked for money, my dad would have given it to him,\" said Manal Shihadeh, \"He didn&apos;t need to do what he did at all.\" Shiahdeh&apos;s oldest daughter, Manal, was studying abroad in Italy when she learned something happened to her dad. The over 9-hour plane ride home - waiting for answers - was agonizing. An arrest is out for the arrest of Alex Lopez, according to the Leesburg Police Department. He's wanted for murder, among other charges. (Photo: Leesburg Police Department) \"My sister hugged me the tightest she could. I asked what happened,\" said Manal Shihadeh, \" My cousin and aunt who picked me up, took me in the car, told me and I broke down.\" Monique Shihadeh says her family calls businesses every day to ask owners to put up Lopez&apos;s picture until he&apos;s found. The family is raising reward money through a GoFundMe Me Account to find Lopez. \"So whoever is out there, if you see him - call Crimeline. Not only will you get whatever reward that they&apos;re offering, there&apos;s an additional reward of $4,500 that the family is offering,\" said Shihadeh. Crimeline is offering up to $5,000 in reward money for any tip that leads to an arrest. \"You shoot and kill a man who&apos;s just trying to run a business, who&apos;s got a family. He&apos;s got children,\" said Barb Bergin, Executive Director for Crimeline. Crimeline says tips are coming in, but they need the right one to find him. They&apos;re asking people to come forward if they saw anything the night of May 30th near the M&M Food Mart - or if you know Lopez. \"It could be pre-homicide. Giving us some background information on where he&apos;s at, who he hung out with, his friends, where he may have gone to hide. Any of that information could be valuable to the investigation,\" said Bergin. To report an anonymous tip, you can call Crimeline at 800-423-TIPS.",

    "text": "In the prevailing digital epoch, the Internet of Things (IoT) has surfaced as an indispensable element. The IoT is an intricate matrix of physical entities, or ‘things’, that possess the ability to connect to the internet. These IoT devices can span from ordinary household commodities to intricate industrial apparatus.\nThe IoT has transformed the manner in which individuals exist and operate, rendering everyday chores more efficient and expedient. It has also paved the way for new prospects for businesses, empowering them to streamline procedures, enhance customer service, and devise new business models.\nThe Necessity of Overseeing IoT Devices\nMonitor status of IoT devices is a crucial facet of administering an IoT network. This involves amassing, scrutinizing, and managing data from these devices. The data amassed from IoT devices can offer valuable insights into their performance and functionality, aiding in identifying potential issues and implementing necessary measures to prevent or rectify problems.\nRemoteIoT: A Premier Instrument for IoT Supervision\nRemoteIoT is a premier instrument for IoT supervision. It offers a platform for users to supervise the status of their IoT devices, exhibit device data, and trigger alerts and notifications in real time. This instrument is particularly beneficial for businesses that heavily rely on IoT devices for their operations.\nSupervising Specific IoT Devices: A Deep Dive into Raspberry Pi\nIn the expansive and ever-evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), certain devices have carved a niche for themselves. They possess a unique blend of features and capabilities that set them apart from the crowd. One such device that has captured the imagination of many is the Raspberry Pi.\nThe Raspberry Pi, despite its diminutive size, is a powerful computer that can comfortably nestle in the palm of people’s hand. It’s a marvel of modern technology, packing enough power to handle a diverse range of IoT tasks. From controlling smart home devices to serving as a server, the Raspberry Pi can do it all.\nThis tiny powerhouse has won the hearts of everyone, from weekend hobbyists experimenting in their garages to seasoned professionals developing complex systems. Its flexibility and affordability are its major selling points, making it an accessible and versatile tool in the realm of IoT.\nHowever, the task of monitoring the status of a Raspberry Pi is not as straightforward as one might think. It requires a specialized set of tools and a particular skill set, each tailored to the device and its specific functions. These tools provide real-time insights into the device’s performance, allowing users to keep a close eye on its operation.\nMonitor status of a Raspberry Pi , or any IoT device for that matter, is a mission-critical task. The primary objective is to ensure the device is running smoothly, performing its tasks efficiently, and maintaining its health. Early detection of potential issues is key to this process. Spotting a problem before it escalates can save time, effort, and resources.\nEnhanced Efficiency and Cost Savings\nMonitor status of IoT devices ensures they are operating at their peak performance. This optimal functioning can significantly enhance efficiency. For instance, in an industrial setting, well-monitored IoT devices can streamline operations, reduce downtime, and increase productivity. Moreover, efficient devices consume less energy, leading to substantial cost savings in the long run.\nProactive Maintenance and Extended Device Longevity\nIoT device supervision allows for the early detection of potential issues. This early detection facilitates proactive maintenance and repairs. For example, a temperature sensor in an IoT-enabled HVAC system might be showing readings that are consistently off by a few degrees. By catching this early, users can recalibrate or replace the sensor before it results in significant energy waste or damage to other components. Such a proactive approach not only enhances the device’s performance but also extends its lifespan, leading to further cost savings.\nInformed Decision-Making and Strategy Development\nSupervising IoT devices also provides valuable insights into device usage patterns. These insights can be instrumental for businesses in understanding how their devices are being utilized. For instance, usage patterns can reveal peak usage times, user preferences, and even potential misuse of the devices. This data can guide decision-making processes, aid in the development of effective strategies, and inform future IoT deployments. It can also help businesses to tailor their services more closely to their customers’ needs, improving customer satisfaction and potentially opening up new revenue streams.\nSecurity and Compliance\nAnother critical aspect of IoT device supervision is security. With the increasing prevalence of IoT devices, they have become attractive targets for cybercriminals. Effective supervision includes monitoring for any signs of security breaches, such as unusual data patterns or unauthorized access attempts, and taking swift action to address them. Additionally, in regulated industries, IoT device supervision can help ensure compliance with standards and regulations, such as data protection and privacy laws.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of IoT supervision continues to grow. Tools like RemoteIoT and techniques for supervising specific devices like the Raspberry Pi are simplifying the process of tracking devices and ensuring their optimal functionality. As we continue to navigate the digital age, the role of IoT supervision will only become more critical. It is indeed an exhilarating time to be part of this technological revolution.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: REMOTEIOT INC.\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: +1 866 516 0608\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://remoteiot.com",

Korea determined to fight for injured goalkeeper\n[By Yonhap](/search/list_reporter.php?byline=Yonhap)\nPublished : Jan. 19, 2024 - 21:59\nIn light of a devastating injury to their top goalkeeper, South Korea head coach Jurgen Klinsmann said Friday the remaining players will be battling hard for their fallen teammate for the rest of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup.\nEarlier on Friday, the eve of South Korea's second Group E match against Jordan in Doha, the Korea Football Association had announced first-choice goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu will miss the rest of the Asian Cup with a torn ligament in his right knee. The 33-year-old had suffered the injury during a training session Thursday.\nHe backstopped South Korea to a 3-1 win over Bahrain to open the AFC tournament Monday. It was Kim's 10th start in 12 matches under Klinsmann, who will now have to turn to veteran Jo Hyeon-woo, with the third-string keeper Song Bum-keun backing him up.\n\"We're very sad about Seung-gyu injury. It's part of sports and it's part of a tournament,\" Klinsmann said during his prematch press conference at the Main Media Centre in Doha. \"We have to move on. We keep him in our thoughts. He's with us even if he's injured and we fight for him.\"\nMidfielder Lee Jae-sung, also at the press conference, said Kim's early exit due to injury hit close to home. At the 2019 Asian Cup, Lee also played only the first match before missing the rest of the competition with a toe injury.\n\"We were all devastated with Seung-gyu's injury. It's really unfortunate,\" Lee said. \"We'll never forget all the work he'd put in to prepare for this Asian Cup, and we'll go out there and battle hard for him. We have 25 players left here and I think his absence will give everyone extra motivation.\"\nBoth Klinsmann and Lee anticipated a tough match against Jordan, although South Korea, at No. 23, sit 64 spots ahead of Jordan in the FIFA rankings.\nKlinsmann pointed to Jordan's convincing, 4-0 win over Malaysia on Monday as evidence that they won't be a pushover.\n\"They played a very, very good first game, and made it clear that they want to go into the next round as well,\" the coach said. \"We respect them a lot. They will make it frustrating for us and we have to find a way to break them down, which is not easy. If you watch the other games, it's not easy for any team out there.\"\nWith Jordan expected to take a more defensive posture against the favored South Korea, Lee said he and his fellow attackers will be prepared.\n\"We struggled in the first half against some tight defending in the first match. I think we have to play wider and deeper, and then create one-on-one opportunities with quick transition,\" the Mainz 05 midfielder said. \"Over the past couple of days, we've been trying to address some problems from the first game and to create more scoring chances.\"\nKlinsmann, on the other hand, disagreed with the notion that Jordan are a defensive side.\n\"If you score four goals, you're not a defensive-minded team,\" Klinsmann said with a smile. \"They've proven their point that they're dangerous every split second. They can counter break really fast. They have very gifted players up front as we know. So we have to be absolutely alert from the first second on about the Jordanian team and give them a lot of respect.\"\nGiven the depth of South Korea's offensive talent, with the likes of Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur and Lee Kang-in of Paris Saint-Germain up front, South Korea should still find ways to score past Jordan. Klinsmann, though, guarded against overconfidence.\n\"There's the difference between confidence and thinking it's easy. Nothing is easy. Every game will be a battle. Every game will be a nail-biter for us. Obviously, we have quality and we know that. But we're going to take it one game at a time.\"\nFive South Korean players, including Son and Bayern Munich center back Kim Min-jae, received a yellow card against Bahrain, and another against Jordan will mean automatic suspension for the third group match against Malaysia next Thursday. Klinsmann said he will leave it up to the players to manage their situation.\n\"They've got to be smart and they're got to handle it. If it happens, they've got to live with the consequence of not being available for a game,\" he said. \"When you are into the game, you do a lot instinctively. I don't think that you can necessarily go into the game and say 'Oh, I got to avoid a yellow card.' If it happens, it happens.\"\nThe South Korea-Jordan showdown will kick off at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Al Thumama Stadium in Doha, or 8:30 p.m. in Seoul.\nA win will essentially guarantee a knockout spot for South Korea, who are trying to win their first Asian Cup title since 1960. The top two nations from each of the six groups and four best third-place teams will advance to the round of 16.\nMore from Headlines\n-\nN.
