    "text": "Man connected to murder of 18-year-old Lakaria Moore pleads guilty LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - On Thursday, a man who helped murder suspect Christopher Carter hide from police pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence. MORE DETAILS: [Second arrest made in connection with murder investigation of Lakaria Moore](https://www.kcbd.com/2023/08/11/second-arrest-made-connection-with-murder-investigation-lakaria-moore/) Jermaal Riggins, 38, turned himself into police on Aug. 11, 2023, over two months after the murder of 18-year-old Lakaria Moore. Police found evidence Riggins “altered, destroyed, or concealed evidence with the intent to make it unavailable as evidence.” Moore went missing on the night of May 21 after leaving a party with her boyfriend, 40-year-old Christopher Carter. She was believed to be in danger and the police asked the public for help. However, her body was later found in the trunk of Carter’s vehicle. The vehicle had been abandoned near North CR 3000 and East CR 6650. A murder warrant was issued for Carter’s arrest. The search for Carter stretched over the following two months before he was located at a motel in the 4100 block of 19th Street. Investigators tried to convince Carter to leave the room, but another man exited and stated Carter had shot himself. Authorities entered the room and found Carter’s body. After Carter’s death, Riggins was soon implicated in the case. Police also [arrested Tahdeejah Washington-Harris](https://www.kcbd.com/2023/08/02/lpd-woman-arrested-after-helping-murder-suspect-christopher-carter-hide-two-weeks/), who was accused of helping Carter avoid capture. On Thursday, Riggins pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. He has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and must turn himself into authorities by 5 p.m. on July 12. Copyright 2024 KCBD. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "'Bad things somehow help the Trump campaign': Ex-Pence adviser warns about ballot removal",
    "text": "Allison Gill's Thursday podcast, \"The Daily Beans,\" addresses the Colorado 14th Amendment lawsuit and the impending case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nSpeaking to former Homeland Security adviser to Mike Pence, Olivia Troye, Gill explained that\nif the Supreme Court doesn't weigh in on the case in time, the Colorado Supreme Court said that Donald Trump must appear on the ballot anyway, despite its ruling. However, the Colorado GOP said that they would withdraw from all primary elections entirely and go to a primary caucus if Trump is banned from the ballot.\nThe case is being watched closely as Maine is trying to decide whether Trump qualifies for its ballot as well,\nas Lawfare's Roger Parloff explained this week in a social media thread. The secretary of state there could use the ruling of the Colorado state Supreme Court to justify not putting Trump on its ballot. There's currently no litigation in the state, but if the top election official there decides to remove Trump from the ballot, there likely will be.\nGill noted that the Colorado decision may be dealing with the primary, but it also\nhas a bearing on the general election ballot. So, if the S upreme Court misses the Jan. 5 deadline for the ballot cutoff, it doesn't mean that the case somehow disappears.\nGill told\nRaw Story via direct message that there are 16 states to watch on the matter.\nDuring the podcast, she explained that there are some debates over whether the 14th Amendment is about someone running for office or taking office. Another legal debate includes questioning whether the presidency is considered to officially be a constitutional office.\nTroye cited more moderate Republicans who are using the excuse that the litigation is taking away the will of the voters. They want to ignore the 14th Amendment entirely and hand it over to the voters.\nALSO READ:\nTrump’s Iowa Faith Leader Coalition includes bigots, advocate of killing Obama\n\"I look at the Supreme Court and I don't know what they'll do,\" she confessed. \"What I am concerned about is that it seems like bad things somehow help the Trump campaign. He did something bad, these are things that potentially keep him off the ballot. And some are like, this is a step in the right direction, hopefully. Anything to keep him out of the Oval Office. I'm always in favor of that because I don't think he should be anywhere near the Oval Office.\"\nTroye explained that on the flip side, it \"galvanizes\" the Trump campaign.\n\"And I just hate the fact that they're — I mean I'm already seeing the talking points. I'm really curious to see how much they've fundraised off of that. They've sent out an email on it already. I just wonder how this plays out in the general public,\" she continued. \"Not that we should fear that in the judicial process, because justice should be justice. And there is something here to be said about let's look at the Constitution and really make a ruling on this.\"",

    "text": "A yellow weather warning for rain and snow has been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. The warning is in place from 8am until 3pm on Saturday and up to 25mm of rain is expected in lower levels of Scotland, according to the Met Office. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain on Saturday, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. This week, Storm Gerrit caused travel disruption across the UK. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Travellers faced disruption across the rail network with operators urging passengers to check their journeys before setting off. Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: “Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. “Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "title": "Julio Castellanos: Los trabajadores están pasando trabajo",
    "text": "La Organización Internacional del Trabajo define explotación laboral como “el acto o serie de actos cometidos por individuos o grupos que abusan de la vulnerabilidad de otros con fines económicos”. En efecto, cuando los trabajadores y obreros venezolanos se enfrentan a empleadores, públicos o privados, que les niegan un salario digno y suficiente para satisfacer sus necesidades, estamos en presencia de un acto deliberado contra las personas que ocasionan sufrimiento y dolor solo para que los explotadores disfruten de mayores ingresos.\nHay prácticas vulgares y reñidas con la legislación vigente que hacen que los trabajadores vivan miserablemente, sin la capacidad de ahorrar o invertir, sin posibilidades reales de conseguir algún día comprar una vivienda, proporcionar educación a sus hijos o tan siquiera enfrentar las contingencias de la vida. Los trabajadores venezolanos no pueden permitirse enfermarse, no pueden entretenerse, no pueden desconectarse del trabajo, la alternativa es el desempleo que, lógicamente, es peor.\nEl rosario de estas prácticas es largo y públicamente conocido: horarios esclavizantes, el robo de prestaciones sociales a través de cálculos infames, contratos contrarios a las leyes, obligatoriedad de firmar hojas en blanco para forjar renuncias o cosas peores, adulterar la relación obrero – patronal con la dependencia al sistema patria en el sector público (con sus efectos sobre la negación de los derechos sindicales y la contratación colectiva). Obviamente, los trabajadores perciben las inclinaciones de la bestia que los devora: hay una creciente discriminación por edadismo notoria porque es más fácil manipular, controlar y explotar a los trabajadores más jóvenes que desconocen sus derechos.\nYa no hay días libres, muchos puestos de trabajo, ahora, ni permiten salir libres los domingos. Muchas veces los momentos de descanso, si es que los hay, son de apenas minutos porque para algunos patrones la costumbre de almorzar es indudable demostración de vagancia. Todos esos abusos, todas esas agresiones, se convierten en más dinero y poder para los empleadores. Los perversos salarios y prácticas de los explotadores sólo pueden provocar trabajadores estresados, enfermos, sin autoestima, viviendo vidas vacías, sin significado, sin alegrías y con muchas tristezas. ¿A qué otra cosa puede atribuirse la alarmante cifra de suicidios, de depresión y de violencia?\nSi ponemos la lupa interseccional al fenómeno de la explotación laboral en Venezuela podríamos ver cosas aún peores, por ejemplo, ¿Qué creen que pueden sufrir las mujeres frente a frente con un depredador sexual que a la vez sea un empleador? ¿El dilema entre la miseria y el hambre o ser víctima del chantaje sexual es un escenario tan difícil de imaginar?. Antes de que salga algún defensor convencido de la absoluta integridad moral de la mayoría de los empleadores venezolanos debe recordarse que todas estas prácticas son penadas por la legislación nacional e internacional pero en nuestro país gobierna todo menos la ley.\nSi tan siquiera hubiera el interés de las autoridades de garantizar los estándares hemisféricos podría abrirse el debate para contrastar y visibilizar tales violaciones usando el Sistema Interamericano de Derechos Humanos pero cuando tal sugerencia se la hice a un funcionario regional en Carabobo me dijo “es que nosotros ya no estamos en la OEA”… A su lado estaba otro importante funcionario regional que complementó ese “razonamiento” rematando “y quizá nos salgamos de la ONU también”. Visto lo visto, los trabajadores seguirán padeciendo los abusos habituales: seguiremos viendo despidos disfrazados de renuncias, bonos en vez de salario, vacaciones y utilidades calculadas al gusto de las empresas y trabajadores que solo se diferencian de los esclavos de la época de la colonia por el solo hecho de que no reciben latigazos… Pero no hablemos muy fuerte, no sea que demos ideas.\nJulio Castellanos / jcclozada@gmail.com",
