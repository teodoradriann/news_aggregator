    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "JERUSALEM: Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday aid delivered via a planned maritime route would go \"to those who need it\" in Gaza, where famine looms after five months of war.\nGallant travelled to the \"shores of Gaza\" on a military boat to inspect \"preparations being made for the construction of a sea dock\" that would receive humanitarian shipments, he said on social media platform X.\nHumanitarian workers and UN officials have said easing overland access of aid trucks into the Gaza Strip would be more effective than maritime shipments or airdrops to alleviate the dire crisis in the besieged territory.\nA charity ship meanwhile prepared to sail from the Mediterranean island-nation of Cyprus, the first delivery along a maritime corridor that would be bolstered by a \"temporary pier\" off Gaza announced by US President Joe Biden.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Gallant was referring to the same pier, which US officials have said would take up to two months to establish.\n\"We will make sure that the aid goes to those who need it, and not to those who do not,\" Gallant said without elaborating on the planned distribution mechanism once aid does make it into Hamas-ruled Gaza.\nThe minister argued the sea corridor would also advance \"the collapse\" of the Palestinian militant group whose October 7 attack on Israel triggered the ongoing war.\n\"The naval aid will help to achieve one of the main goals of the war: the collapse of Hamas rule,\" said Gallant, whose government has faced calls from Israeli protesters demaning a complete halt to Gaza aid.\nHamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 31,045 people in Gaza, the majority women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.\nAid groups say only a fraction of the supplies required to meet basic humanitarian needs have been allowed into Gaza since October.\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday announced the new maritime corridor to Gaza which she said would open by Sunday, though no vessels have yet to make it across and some details of the operation remained unclear.\nThe Gaza health ministry says at least 20 children have died from malnutrition and dehydration, as some residents have resorted to eating leaves and animal fodder.\nThe situation is particularly acute in northern Gaza, where no land crossings have been open for aid trucks.\nMediators had hoped to secure a new truce in the war by the start of the fasting month of Ramadan on Monday, but each side has blamed the other for failing to reach a deal.\nIn southern Gaza on Sunday, residents told AFP they were eager for aid to arrive.\n\"I've been waiting since this morning... the situation is very tragic,\" Mohammed Harara said.\n\"They said there was a boat with humanitarian aid and that people would be able to eat,\" said Mohammed Abu Baid, a displaced resident of Gaza City.\n\"We won't believe it until we see it.\"",

    "text": "FTC is sued by business groups over its ban on noncompete agreements, which may delay enforcement By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN New York (CNN) — Less than 24 hours after the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule this week [banning employers from using noncompete agreements](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/success/ftc-bans-non-compete-clauses/index.html) in the United States, the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable filed a lawsuit against the agency in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas. [Another lawsuit was filed](https://ryan.com/about-ryan/press-room/2024/ryan-challenges-new-non-compete-rule/) in federal court in the Northern District of Texas by business tax services firm Ryan. And more may be filed in the coming weeks. “We think it’s likely additional lawsuits could be filed,” said employment lawyer Daniel Turinsky, a partner at DLA Piper. Even before [the rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes) was issued, the US Chamber had promised to sue on grounds that, in its view, the agency exceeded its administrative authority by outlawing what it deems “unfair methods of competition.” The suit argues that without a clear legislative mandate from Congress, the FTC does not have the power to issue and enforce its blanket noncompete ban. “The FTC contends that by using regulation they can simply declare common business practices to be ‘unfair methods of competition’ and thus illegal. This is despite the fact that noncompete agreements have been around longer than the 110-year-old FTC and until now no one has suggested that they are illegal,” the US Chamber said in a release announcing the lawsuit. “If the FTC can regulate noncompete agreements, then they can decide to regulate or even ban any other business practice. All without a vote from Congress.” The Chamber and the Business Roundtable, along with a third plaintiff — the Longview Chamber of Commerce in Longview, Texas — are [asking the court](https://www.uschamber.com/assets/documents/Chamber-v.-FTC-Motion-for-Stay-and-PI-filed.pdf) to issue a stay to stop the rule from going into effect, a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the FTC from enforcing the rule while the case is being litigated, “or both.” In response to the US Chamber’s lawsuit, FTC Chair Lina Khan expressed confidence the agency is on firm ground legally. Appearing on CNN’s “The Lead With Jake Tapper” after the new noncompete prohibition was announced, she said the agency has “clear legal authority” to issue such a ban. Long delays may be on tap before the rule takes effect The FTC rule isn’t set to go into effect until 120 days from the day it is published in the Federal Register. So likely not before September. But that effective date could be postponed if the federal courts in Texas — or any other courts where suits are filed — decide to grant a stay or preliminary injunction. That leaves employers and employees in limbo when it comes to existing noncompete agreements, almost all of which would become unenforceable if and when the rule takes effect. (The only exception here are existing noncompetes for senior executives — they will remain in force regardless.) In the near term, “I’m generally telling clients to take a wait-and-see approach with respect to the FTC rule while court challenges play out in the next few weeks,” Turinsky said. If the rule is put on ice until the cases are decided, and then appeals are filed, that could further delay the rule’s effective date by many more months if it isn’t ultimately struck down completely. “The rule is being challenged, and there is a fairly significant likelihood that the challenge could be upheld by lower courts,” said James Witz, a shareholder at Littler, an employer-side law firm, and co-chair of the firm’s Unfair Competition and Trade Secrets Practice Group. Translation: “It could take some time for the noncompetes to be invalidated,” Witz said. But employers still seeking to issue new noncompetes while the cases are litigated, may face resistance from some employees who are now aware of the FTC’s action, he noted.
