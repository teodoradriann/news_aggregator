    "text": "一幅长约8.5米的苏河全景图徐徐展开，绽放着流动的河岸文化，以及在河畔滥觞的造币文化。作为《奔流：从上海出发——全球城市人文对话》第二季上海-伦敦双城对话系列活动之一，由上海交大文创学院主办中英造币文化交流主题特展《COINect》，日前在伦敦原英国皇家造币厂旧址（Royal Mint Court）启幕。\n《奔流》系列活动由上海市府新闻办指导、上海报业集团与上海市对外文化交流协会主办，其第二季继续以河为媒，聚焦“一江一河”、泰晤士河作为母亲河，分别给上海和伦敦带来的发展选择和合作契机。从苏州河边的上海造币厂，到泰晤士河边的原英国皇家造币厂，《COINect》特展以币为媒，连接双城，共赴创意未来。\n解放日报·上观新闻记者了解到，《COINect》展览不仅是第一次中国造币文化出海特展，也是中英之间第一次举办青年币章设计大赛。特展现场，象征上海造币工业诞生105年的105枚/组中国币章，或创意灵动，或深沉厚重，呈现底蕴丰厚的中国造币文化。另一边，12件以《我们的水》为主题，出自中英青年的创意币章设计作品，表达出中英青年爱城市爱自然的共同愿望。\n京剧是中国国粹之一。中国京剧艺术（生）普通纪念币上，主图案为京剧艺术生角形象，它曾荣获第41届世界硬币大奖（克劳斯）“最佳流通币”。按照古代戏曲人物扮相与现代生角扮相，币面一精一简，神形兼备，层次分明，还通过人物胡须的飘逸之美体现动感与美感。\n此次展陈的币形也未必是圆形。如古希腊文明铜章就采用异型设计，柱形的造型十分独特。其正面图案为古希腊代表性建筑——爱奥尼克柱；背面图案为古希腊文明史。铜章创新采用热着色工艺，增强了表现力，呈现出古希腊文明对世界尤其是欧洲历史文化具有重要影响力。\n中国驻英国大使馆毕海波公参出席开幕式时表示，两座“造币厂”，依河而立、遥遥相望，中英文化对话此时此刻更加具象、生动。而币章设计大赛的每件参赛作品都映射出两国青年对艺术创作的炽热激情和对美好世界的向往追求。他也热情邀请大家为喜爱的作品投下宝贵一票。\n中国驻英国大使馆毕海波公参致辞。\n作为展览和大赛的合作方，英国伦敦布鲁内尔大学副校长、河流研究专家Trevor Hoey教授认为，无论是气候还是文化层面，上海和伦敦的母亲河都是息息相关的。从2024年的《未来.观——中英青年数字创意展》到2025年的币章设计大赛，中英高校正在创造更多中英青年文化交流和共创机会。他本人也将于下周造访中国，希望以身作则激发青年人的创造力，更坚实推动中英两国的文化交流与合作。\n布鲁内尔大学副校长Trevor Hoey教授致辞。\n“《COINect》第一次以海外特展的方式展示中国特色币章文化和苏州河岸工业文化遗产风貌，是一次真诚创新的尝试。”策展人上海交大文创学院副教授王昊青表示，通过展览，以币为媒，不仅连接当下的城市、文化和创造力，更是在数字化时代，连接历史和未来，引发共鸣，促发共创。\n策展人王昊青为来宾介绍展览。\n据悉，此次展览将展至6月14日，在此期间还将举办“钱币进化与可持续未来”、“数字时代的水岸文化遗产”主题圆桌对话，并在6月12日公布中英青年币章设计大赛的最终获奖作品。此外，展览设置“数字许愿池”“跟着钱币学汉字”“下一个生肖马”生肖币设计等互动项目，以及《外资投资手册（中英双语版）》展区，“半马苏河”系列文创也是首次亮相海外。相关展览动态和活动通过线上方式与国内观众分享。\n原标题：《双城母亲河畔的造币厂让创意“奔流“不息，中英造币文化交流主题特展伦敦启幕》\n图片来源：受访高校\n来源：作者：解放日报 徐瑞哲",

    "text": "Summarize Audio Recordings: Gemini Nano On The Pixel 8 Pro Is Ingenious! [ Matthias \"MaTT\" Zellmer ](/user/7233673/matthias-matt-zellmer) Read in other languages: With the last [Google Feature Drop](https://www.nextpit.com/google-december-pixel-feature-drop-update-pixel-8-pro-what-new), the AI known as Gemini Nano also arrived on the [Google Pixel 8 Pro (review)](https://www.nextpit.com/google-pixel-8-pro-review) for the very first time. You can now use the smallest version of the Large Language Model in the Google Recorder app. What can it do? For starters, the artificial intelligence can create a summary of your audio recordings. We will now show you how this works. - Want another Google tip? [How to transform your Pixel 8 into the best document scanner](https://www.nextpit.com/google-pixel-clean-scanner-feature-step-by-step-guide) Last year, Google distributed the last quarterly Pixel Feature Drop for 2023 after a slight delay. The focus was on the [Google Pixel 8 Pro in particular](https://www.nextpit.com/video-boost-google-pixel-camera-how-to-use), which was given an improved video mode [with the Video Boost function](https://www.nextpit.com/video-boost-google-pixel-camera-how-to-use). The AI ensures better image stabilization, less noise, and optimized lighting. Using the Gemini Nano AI on your Google Pixel 8 Pro Today, we will focus on a function that is only available on the Google Pixel 8 Pro—the in-house Gemini Nano AI. The smallest of Google's LLM models also runs offline, i.e. without an internet connection. The artificial intelligence creates a summary of voice recordings in written form. I'll explain why this can work without an internet connection at the end of this article. Just to provide you with a preview: The magic word is Android AICore. Set the system language to English (US) Unfortunately, there is still a catch: the feature is only available in English (US). Google will gradually deliver additional language packs down the road. So if you want to test Gemini Nano on your Google Pixel 8 Pro, simply set your system language to English (US): - Go to Settings. - Select System. - Scroll to Languages and System languages. - Now, download the English (US) language pack (if you have not done so already). - Move the language to position one (you can do so by a long press on the two dashes). - You are now ready for Google's AI Gemini Nano! The Google Recorder app [distributed a Pixel Feature Drop](https://www.nextpit.com/google-pixel-7-watch-buds-feature-drop-update-december) a year ago, which gave the recorder app the ability to transcribe audio recordings. The AI was also able to differentiate between several speakers and create a dialog from the recording. The first time you use the recorder, Google will ask you whether you want to activate speaker recognition. In my little test with my colleague Rubens, it didn't work 100% as expected, as all three speakers were recognized and the last sentence \"Yes, now we check it\" came from me again (Speaker 1 & 2). There is a caveat though: Neither of us are native English speakers. First voice recording and summary To get a summary of the voice recording converted into text, the text should not be too short. In my first example (first recording), the text proved to be too short. I then read a few paragraphs from my [review of the Amazon Echo Show 5 (2023)](https://www.nextpit.com/amazon-echo-show-5-2023-review). Now, the smartphone also wanted to download the Large Language Model (LLM) of the Gemini Nano AI, which is required for the summary. Wait for a while as the artificial intelligence creates a summary of our transcript. - Interested in another Google Pixel tip? [How to turn your Pixel phone into a webcam](https://www.nextpit.com/how-to-use-pixel-phone-as-pc-mac-webcam) The LLM Gemini Nano works on an AICore Gemini is the latest and most effective artificial intelligence from Google. There are basically three variations: - Gemini Ultra - Google's largest and most powerful model for highly complex tasks. - Gemini Pro - Google's best model for scaling for a wide range of tasks. - Gemini Nano - the most efficient model from Mountain View, for on-device tasks. Gemini Nano uses a system service called Android AICore. It works independently from the rest of the system and does not require access to your network. This is particularly advantageous if you perform tasks that require end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, and want to ensure effective data protection. - Also interesting: [Why the Google Pixel 8 Pro has the best smartphone camera](https://www.nextpit.com/best-camera-phones) Suggestions and replies from Gemini Nano do not leave your smartphone and are therefore secure in nature. This was also particularly important for \"Smart Reply\" in Gboard. In the Developer Preview, the Pixel 8 Pro delivered high-quality reply suggestions with conversational awareness for messenger apps like Line, KakaoTalk, and WhatsApp with the help of Gemini Nano.

    "text": "Major cities across the United States are expected to report significant drops in murder rates this past year to numbers not seen since before the pandemic, indicating violent crime is not as prevalent in the country as some believe.\nAccording to data from cities and towns across the country, compiled by AH Datalytics, murder rates this year had one of the fastest rates of decline on record at approximately 12.8 per cent.\n“Americans tend to think that crime is rising, but the evidence we have right now points to sizable declines this year (even if there are always outliers),” Jeff Asher, the co-founder of AH Datalytics said in a Substack post.\nCities often thought of as dangerous – Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, Baltimore, St Louis, San Francisco and more saw a sharp reduction in murder rates.\nQuarterly data from the FBI reflects similar numbers, showing cities with populations ranging from less than 10,000 to more than one million all saw drops in homicide.\n“The quarterly data in particular suggests 2023 feature one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the United States in more than 50 years,” Mr Asher said.\n(REUTERS)\nThe new data indicates the prevention efforts many cities are implementing to deter violent crime are working effectively.\nDetroit recorded the second-lowest number of homicides since 1966 after putting together a coalition to reduce a backlog of felony gun cases, increase law enforcement staffing, and increase accountability on felony warrants, probation, parole and more.\n“We are seeing record drops in gun violence in Detroit because every single part of the criminal justice system is getting past Covid obstacles and is now working again,” Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement.\nIn Philadelphia, where homicides reached a 10-year record high in 2021, rates fell nearly 25 per cent this past year.\nThe city’s Interim Commissioner John Stanford told 6ABC that the police department had redeployed personnel from administrative positions to the streets to help police districts with high levels of violent crime.\nSt Louis, New Orleans, Baltimore, Atlanta and Portland all recorded more than a 20 per cent drop in murder rates this year. Major metropolitans like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and Charlotte saw a homicide decrease of at least 11 per cent this year.\nNYPD police vehicles respond near the scene of a suspicious package near the Fulton Street subway station in Lower Manhattan on August 16, 2019 in New York City. (Getty Images)\nBut despite the numbers, approximately 63 per cent of Americans perceive crime rates to be increasing nationally and locally, according to polling from Gallup.\nThough rates are significantly down, the prevalence of murder is higher in 2023 than it was before the pandemic – but not by much according to Mr Asher.\nThe US saw an increase in homicides between 2020 and 2021 which could be attributed to an increase in firearm sales as well as pauses and delays in law enforcement interference due to pandemic restrictions.\nSlowly but surely, those rates are falling along with violent crime rates in general.\n“These trends hopefully will be recognized as the positive developments that they are,” Mr Asher wrote.\n“In other words, tell your friends and family because they probably think crime is surging nationally. And in this case, they’re almost certainly wrong.”\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "text": "A judge in New York has ruled that DMXâ€™s ex-wife, Tashera Simmons, canâ€™t claim a 50 percent stake in the rapperâ€™s music catalog and other intellectual property rights. She had attempted to do so by filing a lawsuit against his estate, last year. She cited the coupleâ€™s 2016 divorce agreement, but Judge David F. Everett ruled that the document â€œdoes not confer ownership.â€�\nâ€œThe estate is the sole owner of all intellectual property rights [that] Earl Simmons acquired during his marriage to plaintiff, as well as any and all other trademarks and intellectual property rights that belonged to Earl Simmons at the time of his death,â€� Everett wrote in his ruling. While their divorce settlement did mention â€œintellectual property,â€� the late rapper was adamant before his death that this only referred to royalty payments. Everett continued: â€œUnder the circumstances of this case, the court will not, in effect, reopen those proceedings to reinterpret the partiesâ€™ 2016 settlement agreement, particularly where the party best positioned to contest a contrary interpretation is now deceased.â€�\nDMX & Tashera Simmons\n4 years ago today, the world lost DMX ğŸ•Šï¸�\n[pic.twitter.com/3qBArsyaZ3]— HotNewHipHop (@HotNewHipHop)\n[April 9, 2025]\nDMX and Tashera Simmons's marriage lasted for 16 years. They share four children together: Xavier (born 1992), Tacoma (born 1999), Sean (born 2002), and Praise Mary Ella (born 2005). During their time together, DMX released some of his most popular music. This included the hit singles â€œRuff Rydersâ€™ Anthemâ€� and â€œParty Up (Up In Here).â€� They filed for divorce in 2013, finalizing an agreement three years later. DMX died in 2021 at the age of 50 following a drug overdose and ensuing heart attack. The latest news about Simmons' lawsuit comes almost exactly four years after his passing.\nTashera Simmons did achieve one victory in court, this week, as Judge Everett ruled against dismissing her claim that DMX owed her $214,000 in child support. He suggested that dismissing it, at this point, would be â€œpremature.â€�\n[Via]",
