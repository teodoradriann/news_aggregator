    "text": "By Ismael Lopez\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) – Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country’s top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega’s government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government’s deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez’s detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests’ alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n“I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!” wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.\n(Reporting by Ismael Lopez; Writing by David Alire Garcia and Miral Fahmy)",

    "text": "MARKET MOVERS Investor updates on key trending stocks ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS): Among the Best 3D Printing Stocks to Buy Right Now Sheryar Siddiq Fri, 28 Feb 2025, 0:03 am 6 min read In this article: ANSS -0.59% We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 3D Printing Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) stands against the other 3D printing stocks.\n3D printing, sometimes known as additive manufacturing, is the process of layering materials to create three-dimensional objects and structures using computer-aided design (CAD) technology. Unlike traditional manufacturing procedures, additive manufacturing builds 3D objects layer by layer using a range of materials such as metal, plastic, concrete, and paper. Although the technology has been around for a few years, the industry has expanded massively in recent years due to its limitless applications in commercial manufacturing and large-scale projects.\nAccording to Proto Labs' 2024 3D Printing Trend Report, the 3D printing market was valued at $22.14 billion on average in 2023, an increase of 26.8% from $17.46 billion in 2022. This was 10% more than the company's previous forecast, which predicted a $19.9 billion market size in 2023 with a 17% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The research also suggests a CAGR of 21%, with the market reaching $24.8 billion by the end of 2024 and $57.1 billion by 2028. This rapid market growth rate was also highlighted in replies to the 2024 edition of Proto Labs Network's annual survey of over 700 members of its worldwide engineering community. Around 70% of the survey's respondents reported printing more components in 2023 than in 2022.\nArtificial intelligence is another potential boon for 3D printing. AI's development has been so broad and disruptive in practically every area that it's almost a guarantee it will have an influence on 3D printing as well. AI's revolutionary prospects, such as spotting faults during construction, creating elaborate designs, and even optimizing material qualities, are unquestionably fascinating. However, Adam Hecht, co-founder and head of Additive Manufacturing at DIVE, feels that artificial intelligence will be most useful in hardware devices. He said the following:\n\"Right now, we have a lot of smart printers that are very dumb. They will say something is wrong without specifying what it is. That's very frustrating for a lot of consumers and companies. But as the systems get smarter, they can actually help users to self-diagnose, or dial in new materials, for example—I think that's where we're going to see a lot more adoption.\"\n3D Printing in Healthcare As an additive technology, 3D printing has made its way into most, if not all, industries, but it has proven to be most effective in the healthcare industry, due to its applications in the manufacture of precise prosthetics for amputees, fitted perfectly to the individual's requirements. Another key advantage of 3D printing, especially with regard to medical device development, is its capacity to facilitate rapid prototyping and iterative design. Historically, bringing novel medical equipment to market has required long design versions, tooling techniques, and testing stages. However, 3D printing accelerates the process by allowing designers to quickly construct prototypes and revise concepts in response to feedback and testing results. Given this, it's no wonder that the usage of 3D printing in healthcare is gradually increasing. According to Grand View Research, the healthcare 3D printing market was valued at $8.52 billion in 2023 and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 18.5% between 2024 and 2030.\nStory continues Our Methodology For our list of the 10 best 3D printing stocks to buy, we used financial media reports and ETFs to narrow down on companies involved in 3D printing, additive manufacturing, or technologies related to 3D printing operations. The names on this list are ranked in ascending order according to the hedge fund sentiments surrounding them, using data from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ).\nAn engineer with a diagram of a systems analysis, illustrating the complexity of its product suite.\nANSYS, Inc.

The company's GAAP diluted EPS stood at $3.21, lower than the predicted $3.39, while its non-GAAP diluted EPS increased to $4.44, greatly above forecasts.\nOn February 20, Rosenblatt Securities raised its price target for the ANSS stock to $340 from $335, while keeping a Neutral rating. The change comes after ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) announced a strong fourth-quarter result that exceeded expectations. ANSYS reported a 10% year-over-year growth in revenues, hitting $882.2 million, slightly above Rosenblatt's projection of $872.6 million. The company also announced operating margins of 53%, which came above the expected 51%.\nConestoga Capital Advisors stated the following regarding ANSYS, Inc.

    "title": "El Kremlin ya no oculta sus amenazas a Occidente tras sus cambios en la doctrina nuclear: “Es una advertencia”",
    "text": "El portavoz del gobierno de Putin dijo que Rusia “se está ajustando” a las tensiones que se desarrollan en sus fronteras motorizadas por la invasión a Ucrania y la prolongación de la guerra que trajo aparejada.\nPutin visita una central de desarrollos nucleares en Dubna (Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via REUTERS) Fuente: Infobae\nLos cambios en la doctrina nuclear rusa pretenden disuadir a los aliados occidentales de Ucrania de apoyar ataques contra Rusia , dijo este jueves el Kremlin.\nSu portavoz Dmitri Peskov declaró a la prensa que las revisiones del documento anunciadas por el presidente Vladímir Putin son una “señal de advertencia sobre las consecuencias en caso de que participen en un ataque contra nuestro país con diversos medios , no necesariamente nucleares”.\nSin mencionar a Ucrania, Peskov dijo que la “disuasión nuclear de Rusia se está ajustan do debido a elementos de tensión que se están desarrollando a lo largo del perímetro de nuestras fronteras”.\nEn una nueva y enérgica advertencia a Occidente, Putin anunció el miércoles su intención de ampliar las reglas de Rusia sobre el uso de su armamento nuclear , que le permitirían emplear esas armas en respuesta a un ataque aéreo “masivo”.\nLa amenaza , esbozada en una revisión de la doctrina nuclear de Moscú, estaba claramente dirigida a disuadir a Occidente de permitir que Ucrania ataque a Rusia con armas de mayor alcance y parece rebajar significativamente el umbral para el posible uso del arsenal nuclear ruso.\nEn su intervención durante la reunión del miércoles del Consejo de Seguridad en la que se debatieron los cambios en la doctrina nuclear, Putin no especificó si el documento modificado prevé una respuesta nuclear a un ataque de este tipo , pero subrayó que Rusia podría utilizar armas nucleares en respuesta a un ataque convencional que suponga una “amenaza crítica para nuestra soberanía” , una formulación vaga que deja un amplio margen a la interpretación.\nLa Unión Europea reaccionó el jueves a la amenaza rusa de un cambio de doctrina nuclear, calificándola de “imprudente e irresponsable” , dijo el portavoz de política exterior de la UE, Peter Stano. “Por supuesto, rechazamos firmemente estas amenazas”, afirmó. “No es la primera vez que Putin juega con su arsenal nuclear”, apuntó.\nPutin durante la reunión del miércoles del Consejo de Seguridad en la que se debatieron los cambios en la doctrina nuclear (Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Kremlin via REUTERS) Rusia está avanzando lenta pero constantemente en Ucrania a medida que el conflicto avanza por su tercer año, y el Kremlin está tratando de desalentar un mayor apoyo occidental a Kiev.\nUcrania ha atacado repetidamente territorio ruso con misiles y aviones no tripulados en respuesta a los ataques de Moscú, y el presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelensky , ha estado presionando a Estados Unidos y a otros aliados occidentales para que le permitan utilizar las armas occidentales de mayor alcance para atacar en lo más profundo del territorio ruso. La administración Biden ha dicho que no ha dado permiso a Kiev para atacar con armas estadounidenses en el interior de Rusia.\nPutin señaló que la doctrina revisada detalla las condiciones para el uso de armas nucleares, señalando que podrían utilizarse en caso de un ataque aéreo masivo. La nueva redacción deja la puerta abierta a una posible respuesta nuclear a cualquier ataque aéreo, una ambigüedad deliberada con la que se pretende que Occidente se muestre más reacio a permitir ataques de mayor alcance.\nDesde que Putin envió tropas a Ucrania en 2022, él y otras voces del Kremlin han amenazado frecuentemente a Occidente con el arsenal nuclear ruso para disuadirle de aumentar su apoyo a Kiev.\nA principios de este mes, Putin advirtió a Estados Unidos y a otros aliados de la OTAN que permitir a Ucrania utilizar armas de mayor alcance suministradas por Occidente para golpear territorio ruso pondría a Rusia y a la OTAN en un conflicto directo.\nCómo es la doctrina nuclear rusa\nUn misil balístico intercontinental Yars, que puede cargar una ojiva nuclear, durante un desfile en la plaza Roja de Moscú (REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina) Las armas nucleares no se han utilizado en un enfrentamiento armado desde 1945. Durante la posguerra contar con un poderoso arsenal nuclear tenía fines únicamente de disuasión nuclear. Este concepto es el eje sobre el que gira la estrategia general de las armas nucleares y se basa en que un número limitado de armas nucleares puede originar daños intolerables capaces de disuadir a un agresor potencial.\nLa política rusa también reconoce las armas nucleares únicamente como elemento disuasorio y enumera cuatro casos para su uso:\n1) El lanzamiento de misiles balísticos que atacan el territorio de la Federación Rusa o sus aliados.\n2) El uso de armas nucleares u otros tipos de armas de destrucción masiva contra la Federación Rusa o sus aliados.\n3) Un ataque a sitios críticos gubernamentales o militares de la Federación Rusa que amenaza su capacidad nuclear.\n4) Agresión contra la Federación Rusa con el uso de armas convencionales cuando la existencia misma del estado está en peligro.\nEl presidente ruso pareció referirse a este último punto en su amenazante discurso del miércoles.\nCómo es el arsenal nuclear de Rusia Aunque determinar cuántas armas tiene Rusia es una pregunta difícil de responder, se cree que el país cuenta con el mayor arsenal del mundo , seguido por Estados Unidos.\nEstados Unidos tiene un buen recuento de las armas estratégicas de Rusia, porque Washington y Moscú están obligados a revelar esto según los términos del Nuevo START , el último tratado de control de armas restante y que Putin suspendió el año pasado.\nTodas las cifras de armas nucleares son estimaciones, pero, según la Federación de Científicos Estadounidenses, Rusia tiene 5.977 ojivas nucleares , los dispositivos que desencadenan una explosión nuclear, aunque esto incluye alrededor de 1.500 que están retiradas y listas para ser desmanteladas. Otras estimaciones hablan de 6.375 ojivas, frente a las 5.800 de EEUU.\nDe las aproximadamente 4.500 restantes, la mayoría se consideran armas nucleares estratégicas, que son los misiles de mayor alcance que pueden cruzar océanos y amenazar a las superpotencias rivales. Los expertos estiman que alrededor de 1.500 ojivas rusas están actualmente “desplegadas” , es decir, ubicadas en bases de misiles y bombarderos o en submarinos en el mar.\nEl resto son armas tácticas , más pequeñas y menos destructivas. Algunos están diseñadas para ser utilizados por la marina, algunas para ser utilizadas por la fuerza aérea y otras para ser utilizadas por el ejército, ya sea en misiles de corto alcance tierra-tierra o en defensas aéreas tierra-aire, pero no están desplegadas previamente. Según los expertos, estas son las que Rusia podría en algún momento utilizar en Ucrania.\nLa Inteligencia estadounidense estima que Rusia cuenta con entre 1.000 y 2.000 de estas armas tácticas. Por su parte, después de un cuidados estudio, la Federación de Científicos Estadounidenses estimó 1.912 armas tácticas, aunque advirtió que esto podría incluir ojivas retiradas.",

    "title": "\"L'esercito russo cerca di sfondare su 7 fronti\": cosa succede in Ucraina",
    "text": "“L’esercito russo cerca di sfondare su 7 fronti”: cosa succede in Ucraina\nAumenta la pressione della Russia nell’est dell’Ucraina. Le forze del Cremlino stanno cercando di avanzare su sette fronti nel Donetsk e nel Lugansk, come ha sottolineato in un briefing lo Stato maggiore di Kiev, secondo nelle ultime 24 ore sarebbero stati eliminati “920 militari russi, portando le perdite totali delle truppe nemiche a circa 356.670 soldati uccisi”. Numeri e dati che tuttavia non illustrano a dovere la recente avanzata di Mosca, che ha appena conquistato la città chiave di Mariinka, considerata la porta di accesso a Donetsk. Nel frattempo, per aiutare gli uomini di Volodymyr Zelensky a reggere contro l’onda d’urto rivale, gli Stati Uniti sono pronti ad inviare un nuovo pacchetto di armamenti.\nGli attacchi di Mosca in Ucraina orientale Kiev ha fatto sapere di aver respinto pesanti attacchi nella regione di Kharkiv, in direzione di Kupyansk, a Lyman, a Serebryansk (Lugansk). Sono stati segnalati combattimenti anche sulla linea del fronte a Bakhmut (Donetsk). Nella direzione di Bakhmut, gli ucraini hanno respinto due attacchi vicino a Bogdanovka. Sempre nel Donetsk, nell’ultimo giorno di combattimento le truppe di Kiev hanno respinto 15 attacchi a est di Novobakhmutovka e Avdiivka e 17 attacchi vicino a Severny, Pervomaisky e Nevelsky.\nLe forze ucraine continuano a tentare di respingere i russi anche nelle aree di Marinka e Novomikhailovka. Sull’asse Lyman, come detto, le forze ucraine hanno respinto tre attacchi nell’area forestale di Serebriansk, nella regione di Lugansk. I russi hanno attaccato anche nelle zone di Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia e Kherson. Lo Stato maggiore ha anche annunciato l’uccisione di 920 soldati russi nell’ultimo giorno e la distruzione di 27 carri armati e 15 sistemi di artiglieria. Nella notte, infine, sono stati colpiti sette degli otto droni lanciati dalle forze di Mosca sull’Ucraina.\nAllo stesso tempo, il ministero della Difesa di Mosca ha comunicato che i sistemi di difesa aerea russi hanno abbattuto due droni ucraini sopra la Crimea. “Nella scorsa notte sono stati fermati i tentativi di Kiev di compiere un attacco terroristico utilizzando veicoli aerei senza pilota (Uav) contro obiettivi sul territorio della Federazione Russa. I sistemi di difesa aerea in funzione hanno distrutto due droni ucraini sopra il territorio della Repubblica di Crimea”, ha affermato il ministero in una nota.\nLe mosse della Russia Il ministro della Difesa russo, Sergej Shoigu, ha dichiarato che l’obiettivo del Cremlino in questa fase del conflitto era quello di “sventare la controffensiva delle forze armate ucraine” e che il compito è stato “portato a termine con successo”. Ricordiamo che Kiev ha lanciato la sua controffensiva a giugno, e che Zelensky ha affermato che la campagna “non ha ottenuto i risultati desiderati”. Con l’arrivo dell’inverno è intanto iniziata una nuova fase della guerra, con la Russia pronta nuovamente ad attaccare e Kiev intenta a respingere gli uomini del Cremlino.\nIn un simile scenario gli Stati Uniti forniranno all’Ucraina un nuovo pacchetto di aiuti militari, il 54esimo dall’agosto del 2021, da 250 milioni di dollari che comprende munizioni per la difesa aerea per i sistemi Himars, Stinger, Javelin, e per l’artiglieria, oltre che missili anticarro AT-4. Secondo quanto ha reso noto il Pentagono si tratta di “capacità per supportare le necessità più pressanti dell’Ucraina per consentire alle sue forze militari di difendere la sua sovranità e indipendenza. La leadership degli Usa è essenziale per sostenere gli sforzi di una coalizione in sostegno dell’Ucraina di cui fanno parte circa 50 alleati e partner”. “L’assistenza nella sicurezza per l’Ucraina è un investimento intelligente nella nostra sicurezza nazionale”, ha precisato il dipartimento della Difesa in un comunicato.",
