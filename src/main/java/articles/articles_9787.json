    "title": "Theresa Nist Celebrated Daughter Jen's Birthday Amid 'Golden Wedding' - Us Weekly",
    "text": "The Golden Bachelor’s\nTheresa Nist had a lot to celebrate on Thursday, January 4. Not only did the reality star officially get married to Gerry Turner, she celebrated daughter Jen Woolston’s birthday as well.\n“Happy birthday to my beautiful, strong, kind, supportive, loving, super smart, and overall wonderful and amazing daughter, and my best friend, Jennifer Ann!!” Theresa shared via Instagram on Thursday, January 4. “I could not dream of a better daughter. I love you with all my heart!!! I hope you have the best birthday ever!!!!”\nJen’s birthday was briefly mentioned during\nThe Golden Wedding special when she spoke during her mom’s wedding ceremony.\n“Please welcome Theresa’s daughter, Jen. And happy birthday, Jen,” wedding officiant and former\nGolden Bachelor contestant Susan Noles said during the televised ceremony. Theresa offered a big smile and clapped for her daughter when her birthday was mentioned.\n“I’ve said many times since I first heard the incredible news that my mom and Gerry were engaged that this feels surreal, like, how is this real life?” Jen wondered during her speech during Thursday’s live ceremony. “But somehow, it was always meant to be. Fate. Mom, you found your person to go to Italy with. And Gerry, you’ve got your person to share a sunset with. And you have the love and support of all your children and grandchildren.”\nJen was first introduced to Golden Bachelor viewers during Theresa’s hometown date, which aired in November 2023. She was always supportive of her mom’s decision to find love, after the\ndeath of her father, William “Billy” Nist, nearly a decade ago.\n“It doesn’t really feel that weird for some reason,” Jen, whose kids were part of the wedding, said on the Golden Bachelor. “It doesn’t change how much love we have for my dad.”\nWhen it came time for Theresa’s wedding ceremony to Gerry, Jen was front and center for the planning process.\n“My daughter has been helping me tremendously. She put together the vision board, and it was all beautiful. I love flowers, so important, and I love music,” Theresa\ntold Us Weekly exclusively days before her wedding. “I think just really to make this the most warm, wonderful family-oriented wedding, and to try not to even think that there are cameras around. Try to make it an intimate moment that we’re sharing with a lot of people.”\nAhead of the big day, Jen posted throwback photos from her own wedding to husband Matt Woolston in 2011.\n“Sitting on the plane… went back to look at pics from my wedding day,” she captioned a Tuesday, January 2,\nInstagram post. “Can’t wait to support my best girl like she did for me. love you @theresa_nist you’re going to be an incredible bride and I can’t wait to see it with my own eyes. 💛💛💛”",

    "text": "As many as 15 policemen lost their lives when the riverine dacoits ambushed two police mobile vans in Rahim Yar Khan on Tuesday. The police sources said around two-dozen police personnel were deployed at Machka Camp 2 in the riverine area. They were returning to Rahim Yar Khan in two police mobile vans for weekly holiday when one of their vehicles broke down due to stagnant floodwater in the area. Seeing policemen trapped in the rainwater, the riverine dacoits fired rockets at the police party, leaving 15 of them dead. Two policemen sustained injuries in the attack while four were missing. Police reinforcements were dispatched to the riverine area immediately after the incident and security personnel were put on high alert across the province. The Punjab government declared emergency at Shaikh Zaid Hospital and THQ Hospital Sadiqabad. Additionally, doctors' holidays have been cancelled and they have been directed to report to duty. Taking notice of the incident, Chief Minister Punjab Marriyum Nawaz Sharif and IG Punjab Dr Usman Anwar sought report from RPO Bahawalpur and DPO Rahim Yar Khan. Meanwhile, a police spokesman confirmed the deaths of nine policemen in the attack, adding four others were injured. Condemnations pour in President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the attack on a police convoy by riverine area dacoits in Rahim Yar Khan. A press release from the President's House stated that the president extended his condolences to the families of the police officers, who were martyred in the attack. The president emphasized the need for strict action against criminals in the Kacha area and warned that attacks on personnel of police and law enforcement agencies would not be tolerated. He paid tribute to the martyred policemen and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also wished for the speedy recovery of those injured in the incident. Punjab Chief Minister Marriyum Nawaz condemned the attack on policemen and expressed condolences with the bereaved families. Deputy Commissioner Khurram Parvaiz expressed grief over the deaths of policemen in the outlaws' attack. He said the perpetrators of the heinous attack will be made an example. He added that such cowardly actions could not shake the morale of the government and the law-enforcement personnel. The lawyers' fraternity announced a day of mourning. A press release issued by the District Bar Association said the lawyers' community will observe a day of mourning over the incident. The lawyers expressed solidarity with the police and described the incident as a cowardly act. COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

    "text": "A primeira-dama Janja Lula da Silva comemorou nesta 5ª feira (11.jul.2024) o que classificou como “grande vitória” para a causa animal na reforma tributária. Em vídeo gravado ao lado do ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad , a socióloga disse que foi procurada pela apresentadora Xuxa para que planos de saúde para pets não fossem tributados no projeto.\n“E foi muito importante porque ontem a gente conseguiu também incluir uma questão que há duas semanas a gente tem sido procurada por protetores animais, por pessoas ligadas à causa animal. Minha amiga Xuxa me procurou, conversei com o ministro Haddad, o Ministério da Fazenda se movimentou e eu queria que você falasse um pouquinho, Haddad, como que ficou isso na reforma tributária, que foi uma grande vitória para os protetores e para a causa animal” , declarou.\nFormulário de cadastro receba alertas grátis do Poder360 quero receber por e-mail concordo com os termos da LGPD . quero receber no WhatsApp Inscreva-se quero receber no Telegram Inscreva-se O ministro explicou, em seguida no vídeo, que foi incluído um regime diferente para a área. Sem ser tributado 100%, seguirá a mesma regra de veterinários, com menos impostos. Segundo ele, a mudança veio depois de receber empresários do setor na Fazenda.\nLogo na abertura do vídeo, entretanto, a primeira-dama erra a data desta 5ª feira (11.jul). Ela olha para seu relógio inteligente e diz que são 10h30 de 4ª feira (10.jul) e que a reforma tributária foi aprovada “ontem a noite” . O principal PLP (Projeto de Lei Complementar) da tributária foi aprovado na 4ª feira (10.jul).\n“Olha só, 10h30 da manhã 4ª feira, ontem a noite foi votada no Congresso a reforma tributária e eu estou aqui com o ministro Haddad, meu amigo, ministro Haddad” , disse.\nAssista (4min30s):",

    "text": "Grupos ambientalistas e indígenas do Equador ameaçam agir contra campo petrolífero amazônico\nAmbientalistas e grupos indígenas do Equador disseram nesta quinta-feira que o presidente Daniel Noboa corre o risco de ser destituído do cargo se não cumprir um referendo que exigiu o fechamento de um bloco de petróleo na região amazônica do país.\nNo ano passado, a maioria dos equatorianos votou pelo fechamento do bloco 43-ITT para proteger a reserva Yasuni na Amazônia, e o tribunal superior do país concedeu um ano para a remoção da infraestrutura de petróleo na região.\nRecentemente, Noboa ventilou a ideia de adiar o fechamento do bloco, citando como motivo os recursos necessários para financiar a ofensiva militar declarada por ele para combater as gangues criminosas que ele designou como terroristas em meio à violência crescente.\nA estatal Petroecuador já havia dito anteriormente que o fechamento do bloco -- que produz cerca de 55.000 barris de petróleo por dia -- poderia ser iniciado em agosto.\n\"Se o presidente assinar um documento declarando que não cumprirá a vontade do povo..., o Tribunal Constitucional terá que remover o presidente, nós nos encarregaremos de apresentar acusações criminais\", disse a jornalistas Pedro Bermeo, do grupo de defesa ambiental Yasunidos, que trabalhou pelo referendo.\nDurante a mesma entrevista coletiva, Leonidas Iza, presidente do maior grupo indígena do Equador, a Conaie, ameaçou levar o caso ao tribunal superior do Equador e à Comissão Interamericana de Direitos Humanos (CIDH), se necessário.\n\"Os democratas respeitam a vontade do povo\", disse Iza. \"Os oportunistas se aproveitam da vontade do povo para seus próprios fins. O presidente Noboa está no ponto de revelar se é um oportunista ou um democrata.\"\nO governo não respondeu a pedidos de comentários.\nO fechamento do bloco pode custar ao Equador cerca de 13,8 bilhões de dólares nas próximas duas décadas e resultará na perda de 12% da produção de petróleo do país, de cerca de 492.000 bpd, de acordo com a Petroecuador.",

    "text": "The latest trading session saw UnitedHealth Group ( UNH Quick Quote UNH - Free Report ) ending at $502.42, denoting a -1.69% adjustment from its last day's close. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.43%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.01%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.47%.\nHeading into today, shares of the largest U.S. health insurer had lost 1.67% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's gain of 4.6% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.6% in that time.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of UnitedHealth Group in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $7.24, marking a 4.78% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $110.97 billion, up 11.2% from the prior-year quarter.\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $29.54 per share and revenue of $451.19 billion, indicating changes of +6.8% and +12.72%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.7% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, UnitedHealth Group possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at its valuation, UnitedHealth Group is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 17.3. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 16.09.\nAlso, we should mention that UNH has a PEG ratio of 1.4. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Medical - HMOs industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.\nThe Medical - HMOs industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 203, putting it in the bottom 20% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow UNH in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.",
