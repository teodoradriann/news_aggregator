    "text": "Harrison Butker Breaks Silence on Commencement Speech Backlash: ‘Bold Witness for Christ’\nBy Movieguide® Contributor\nKansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has finally broken the silence following his viral commencement speech at Benedictine College.\nMovieguide® recently\nreported on his speech:\nDuring Butker’s\n[speech]he “extolled the virtues of motherhood as he encouraged female graduates and other women in the audience to ‘disregard the outside noise’ that encourages them to prioritize their careers above everything else.”\n“The majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world,” the kicker\n, addressing the women who were graduating.\n“I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabelle, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother,” he\n. “I’m on the stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation.”\n“I’m beyond blessed with the many talents God has given me, but it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school would convert to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all: homemaker,” Butker\n.\nHis initial speech also\ncalled out President Biden and addressed abortion.\nWhile he received immense backlash for his comments, many defended his position. At the\nRegina Caeli Academy’s Courage Under Fire gala, Butker said he doesn’t regret standing up for what he believes.\n“If it wasn’t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now,” Butker\nsaid at the gala in Nashville, Tennessee. “Over the past few days, my beliefs — or what people think I believe — have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe.”\n“At the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion,” he\ncontinued.\nButker does not “regret” his decision because his ultimate goal is not to please man but to please God.\n“If we have truth and charity, we should trust in the Lord’s providence and let the Holy Ghost do the rest of the work,” Butker\nexplained. “Our love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world. Glorifying God and not ourselves should always remain our motivation despite any pushback or even support.”\n“It is not people but Jesus Christ who I am trying to please,” he\nadded. “In reality, any courage I’ve shown will lead to some small suffering, and it will lead to some people maybe never liking me, but that could be God’s will. If I constantly remind myself of the hardships the saints went through, especially the martyrs in their persecution, it makes it all seem not so bad.”\n“If heaven is our goal, we should embrace our cross, however large or small it may be, and live our life with joy to be a bold witness for Christ,” Butker\nconcluded.\nMovieguide® previously\nhttps://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/chiefs-kicker-harrison-butker-gives-vulnerable-unborn-a-voice-at-white-house-ceremony.html on Butker’s pro-life advocacy:\nKansas City Chief’s kicker, Harrison Butker was praised after he spoke on the importance of pro-life at the White House ceremony for the Super Bowl champions.\n“I want to give the most vulnerable, the unborn, a voice at a place where every effort has been made to allow and normalize the tragic termination of their lives,” Christian Headlines\nof Butker.\n“As a father who has experienced three miscarriages, my wife and I understand the hardships that come with losing a child,” he added. “Every life is precious and should be valued whether outside or inside the womb.”\nButker was spotted endorsing a tie made by pro-life organization\n[Live Action]. The tie contained the Latin phrase “Vulnerari Praesidio” on it, which means “protect the most vulnerable.”\nPro-life activist Anna Lulis\n[tweeted]of Butker, Super Bowl champion, Harrison Butker ( [@buttkicker7]) wore a pro-life tie behind the most pro-abortion U.S. President, Joe Biden. The tie said PROTECT THE VULNERABLE in Latin. This is what real masculinity looks like, courageously standing up for the most vulnerable, the preborn.”\nShare:",

    "text": "You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit [image gallery](/image_purchases) to purchase the image. Following deliberations on the council’s 2024-25 annual plan yesterday, Central Otago District Mayor Tim Cadogan confirmed to the Otago Daily Times he had, during drop-in sessions on the annual plan, suggested reverse mortgages could be used to pay for the rates increase. His suggestion was slammed by two submitters, one labelling it disturbing and the other saying it showed elected members were out of touch. Reverse mortgages allow older homeowners to borrow against the value of their home, the loan being repaid when the homeowner dies. Mr Cadogan said he had tried to offer a practical solution to ratepayers, given the present financial climate. \"There were a number of times at drop-in sessions ... when pensioners explained to me the impact that these increases, alongside all the other financial challenges that they are facing, could lead to not heating their homes or cutting back on food. \"I tried to be practical in responding to the situation these folk feared they would find themselves in and said, as a last measure, to meet the cost-of-living crisis they are facing, including the projected rates increases, they could consider reverse mortgages.\" While the suggestion was unpalatable for some, many people were \"asset rich and cash poor\". \"Suggesting utilising some of that asset to make their lives better, to avoid cutting back on heating or food was, I feel, better than offering empty sympathy.\" Two submitters touched on the comments made at drop-in sessions by Mr Cadogan during deliberations in Alexandra yesterday. Former MP Gerry Eckhoff said he could not believe Mr Cadogan had suggested reverse mortgages. \"I’ve also heard, and it’s very disturbing Mr Mayor, that you’ve actually ... suggested to some ratepayers — and I can’t believe this is true — that reverse mortgages are a good way to pay for your rates,\" he said. Submitter Trevor Goudie said the suggestion showed \"elected members have lost touch with reality\". Mr Cadogan did not respond to the comments during the meeting. Councillors heard 13 verbal submissions and considered over 150 written submissions on the annual plan. At the meeting, council chief executive Peter Kelly said the average proposed rates increase was about 18.4%, down from 21.4% as proposed in the draft annual plan. However, he accepted 18.4% was still a \"terrible position to be in\".",
