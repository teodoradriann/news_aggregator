    "title": "La esperanza que mantiene Ucrania pese a la guerra con Rusia - MDZ Online",
    "text": "La esperanza que mantiene Ucrania pese a la guerra con Rusia Distintas autoridades ucranianas informaron que el Gobierno de dicho país aún mantiene las esperanzas de que la economía crezca, pese a estar en medio de la guerra con Rusia. A pesar de la guerra, es probable que la economía de Ucrania crezca alrededor de un 4,6% en 2024, aunque los ataques con misiles rusos podrían hacer bajar ese indicador. Según el sitio Ukrinform, esta previsión la describió la primera viceprimera ministra y ministra de Economía, Yulia Svyrydenko, al inaugurar el Foro del Día de la Inversión en Kiev. La funcionaria recordó que, después de una caída a gran escala de la economía (casi el 30% en 2022), el año pasado comenzó el crecimiento, que fue al menos del 5,3%. \"Esperamos que este año la economía siga recuperándose, al menos entre un 4,5% y un 4,6%. Por supuesto, los indicadores pueden empeorar debido a los ataques con misiles, principalmente contra la infraestructura energética ucraniana, pero nuestra previsión básica sigue siendo del 4,6%\", afirmó Svyrydenko. Según sus palabras, el desarrollo de la industria militar nacional contribuirá a garantizar ese crecimiento. El Ministerio de Economía calculó que la mitad del presupuesto destinado a la compra de armas y la creación de producción conjunta con empresas extranjeras supondrá un aumento adicional del PIB de al menos un 3,6%. \"Los indicadores del año pasado demostraron que al menos el 1% del crecimiento del producto nacional bruto se debió al desarrollo del complejo militar- industrial\", explicó la primera viceprimer ministra. El segundo motor del crecimiento económico es el desarrollo de las exportaciones y la mejora de los corredores de transporte, explicó la ministra. En particular, se trata de ampliar el corredor marítimo a productos agrícolas y a otros tipos de productos de exportación, incluidos los metalúrgicos, y bienes de alto valor agregado. \"Es de vital importancia para nosotros. Como, por supuesto, la expansión de las capacidades energéticas de Ucrania, su desarrollo. Necesitamos construir y desarrollar una generación descentralizada y altamente maniobrable\", enfatizó Svyrydenko. En su opinión, la recuperación que a pesar de todo continúa es un argumento importante a favor de invertir en Ucrania incluso en condiciones tan difíciles. \"Después de todo, la historia conoce pocos países que, estando en guerra, demostraron crecimiento económico\", destacó la funcionaria. Los participantes en el Kyiv Investment Day, organizado por el Ministerio de Economía con el apoyo del programa \"Economía Competitiva de Ucrania\" de USAID, abordaron la importancia de invertir ahora en aquel país. El informe recordó que el FMI predice que este año el producto interior bruto real de Ucrania crecerá un 3,2%. En 2025, el ritmo debería acelerarse hasta el 6,5% y, en 2029, estabilizarse en la cifra del 4,5% interanual. En 2022, la caída de la economía fue del 29%. El contraste con la Argentina es notorio: la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE) pronosticó este jueves una mayor recesión para este año, con una caída de la actividad del 3,3%.

    "title": "PM Modi arrives in UK; India-UK free trade agreement set to be signed on Jul 24",
    "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – London\nLondon, Jul 24: In a landmark diplomatic and economic development, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in London today for a high-profile visit during which the long-anticipated India–UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is set to be formally signed. Accompanying the Prime Minister is Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, who will co-sign the deal with his British counterpart.\nThe agreement marks the conclusion of three years of rigorous negotiations, officially wrapped up on May 6, and is touted as one of the UK’s most significant trade pacts post-Brexit.\nAccording to official sources, the FTA will eliminate tariffs on Indian exports such as leather, textiles, footwear, and garments, providing a significant boost to India’s labour-intensive sectors. In return, imports of British whisky, premium automobiles, and other goods will become more affordable for Indian consumers.\nThe trade deal is expected to double bilateral trade to USD 120 billion by 2030. While the Indian Cabinet has already cleared the agreement, it now awaits ratification by the British Parliament to come into force.\nAs per the commerce ministry, 99% of Indian products will receive duty-free access to the UK, covering nearly the entirety of the current trade volume.\nIn a notable parallel announcement, both nations have agreed on a double contribution convention, providing social security relief for Indian professionals working in the UK. This arrangement will exempt employers from paying additional social security contributions on behalf of Indian employees posted in the UK — a longstanding demand by the Indian side.\nTrade statistics further reinforce the positive trajectory in economic relations:\n• India’s exports to the UK rose by 12.6% to $14.5 billion, while\n• Imports from the UK climbed 2.3% to $8.6 billion in 2024–25.\n• Bilateral trade rose to $21.34 billion in 2023–24, up from $20.36 billion the previous fiscal year.\nBritain continues to be a key investor in India, standing as the sixth-largest investor with a $36 billion portfolio. Nearly 1,000 Indian companies operate in the UK, employing over 1,00,000 people, and contributing $2 billion in investments.\nAfter wrapping up his UK visit, PM Modi will proceed to the Maldives on the invitation of President Mohamed Muizzu, signalling a significant thaw in India-Maldives relations following recent diplomatic friction.\nThe India–UK FTA not only opens new avenues for trade but also reflects India’s growing stature in the global economic order — a vision actively pursued under PM Modi’s foreign policy doctrine of strategic partnerships and Atmanirbhar Bharat.",

    "title": "Artists from Jerusalem gallery collective return amid war",
    "text": "Art hath healing powers. As we continue to lick our physical and emotional wounds, increasing numbers of artists, across all sorts of disciplines and fields have begun to roll out some of their creations in a bid not only to express their own thoughts and feelings about the current dire straits but also to enable us to feed off their work and possibly gain some reflective respite from the doom and gloom.\nBattlefield exchanges have provided many painters with inspirational raw material over the centuries. There’s Turner’s marine-set Battle of Trafalgar from 1824; the tapestry-like Battle of San Romano by Italian Renaissance artist Paolo Uccello; and Goya’s evocative Third of May 1808, from 1814. And who could forget Guernica, the iconic anti-war statement by Picasso created in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War?\nRina Peled believed that some of our own artists could also do something about conveying some wartime sensibilities to the public. The seasoned Jerusalem-born artist is a member of the professional collective that forms the Agripas 12 gallery, stashed away in the quaint back alleys betwixt the shuk, Jaffa Road, and King George Street.\nShe shared her thoughts with fellow gallery member Oded Zaidel, and the Returning group exhibition duly came to be. The show opened on December 21 and is due to run through to the end of January.\nPeled says she and her cohorts felt compelled to put their emotions and musings out there. She says Returning is “an exhibition in which everyone expresses his or her feelings in the face of reality at this time. It is precisely in the midst of chaos and pain, when we are overwhelmed with feelings of insecurity, fear, and frustration, that we must offer ourselves and others the consolation of art.”\nIt is a multifaceted offering covering a multitude of aesthetic and conceptual bases, taking in video art, installations, paintings, photography, and etchings. Curators Peled and Zaidel have done a good job with placing the works around the white walls of the gallery, leaving plenty of air between them without overdoing the dimensional spread. And the juxtapositioning of monochrome and colorful creations and works of different disciplinary stripes, textures, and volumes has been achieved with a subtle but sure touch.\nThe exhibits run the gamut of expressive presentation. There are works that beg some thought and contemplation to eke out the underlying message, while others are more feral and immediate. Ariane Littman’s two-parter spells out the emotive state of affairs in no uncertain terms.\nAn art exhibition amid the trauma of the Israel-Hamas war\nThe larger of the two components features an old suitcase stuffed full with pristine, rolled-up white gauze bandages, with a diminutive enamel bowl daintily placed on top. On closer inspection, you notice the white bowl has hundreds, possibly thousands, of numerals painted on it in shades that vary between dark red and black. The tightly packed numbers are repeated copiously around the circumference of the vessel –\n7.10.23. – the date that is forever etched into our hearts and the national psyche.\nTHE INK shade Littman uses in Suitcase 2023 leaves no room for doubt. This is blood – blood that oozes, drips, and flows – the blood of the youngsters murdered at the\nSupernova music festival, of the hostages and the moshavniks and kibbutzniks in the Gaza envelope, and the blood of our soldiers who continue to fall in battle.\nLittman, an interdisciplinary artist and lecturer at The DAN Department of Creative Human Design, Hadassah Academic College in Jerusalem, pulls no punches. She has been highly active on the local art scene since the Second Intifada and the Second Lebanon War, addressing issues of conflict and national woes. Bandages came into her creative purview after her daughter suffered serious burns in 2009.\nSuitcase 2023 has another, Holocaust-related, subtext to it. “The suitcase, bought at a flea market in Berlin, is related to an installation I did in Berlin in a gallery that was once the house of a Jewish family who was forced to sell for nothing and flee,” Littman explains.\nLike the rest of the Agripas gang, it took Littman a while to resurface from the depths of despair and despondency after\nOctober 7. “After the Black Shabbat, I was paralyzed,” she recalls. “The trauma was so great that I wasn’t able to create anything. I asked myself whether there was any room for art, and it was only a month and a half later that I went back to my studio, and I created works that connect to the war.”\nThe same could be said of her fellow exhibitors. They express – in their own way, format, and discipline – their sadness, their ruminations on the meaning of life, and the unfathomable savagery that was wreaked on us. Photographer Doron Adar’s Blood of Anemone #101 is an alluring tetraptych based on the titular flower, which, naturally, puts one in mind of blood. Adar cleverly navigates his way through permutations of black, white, and red.\nIn the top left frame, the flowers are set against a dark, black-gray, grassy substratum, which accentuates the brightness of the petals. You get a similar effect in the print to its right, although in brighter shots the flowers seem to be more detached, as if hovering ethereally in some physical or emotional void.\nThe human element is conveyed by a couple seated in the meadow. Are they lovers? Siblings? Are they just basking in the bucolic tranquility or are they comforting each other in the wake of some tragedy? Adar also plays the light-shade balancing act deftly, and allows us to complete the colorful picture ourselves in the monochrome photograph.\nTHE CURATORIAL continuum sets off delicate works against creations that grab you and demand you spend some time with them. Yoram Blumenkranz’s diptych clearly pertains to the former. At first glance, his contribution appears to comprise thread delicately sewn into cloth or possibly pencil dashes that ebb and flow airily to create a delightfully subtle sense of airiness and natural dynamics.\nIn fact, Blumenkranz went for a diametrically contrasting raw material – plain old office staples. Somehow he manages to convey the sense, and something akin to the actual touch, of a far softer, more supple means of visual communication. You can almost feel the air eddying around the wheat sheaves and palm tree in the pictures. The crisscross tree bark of the trunk is simply delectable.\nBlumenkranz clearly had dissonance and the violence down south in mind when he crafted the plywood base work. He bluntly describes it as “a targeted landscape,” adding that all his component choices leave their imprint not only on the corporeal nature of his work; they also add their mark on our perception of our surroundings.\n“It is impossible for things not to leave an impression,” he posits, before reeling off a list of everyday incidents that change the physical state of play and tweak our sensibilities. “A cup is dropped into a sink, blood on a cutting board, a toe against a door frame, a forgotten key, a swallowed bank card, a threadbare pocket, and a shekel coin that slips through the fingers.”\nThat’s quite a litany of quotidian mini-disasters that could throw anyone off their stride. Blumenkranz waxes a little poetic. “A sudden pulse and a slip, and gunfire tears the peace of the street asunder, attaching a piece of paper to a noticeboard about his [own] death. The whole landscape is shot, and the plywood takes it all,” he adds. Appearances, it seems, can be a little misleading.\nBitya Rosenak’s spread also follows a monochromic line and references her predilection for fabric-oriented designs and textures. She says she started out on the series prior to the war. The works subsequently took on a new, darker meaning. “As usual, I experimented with different materials. This time I examined how paint reacts with milk,” she explains.\nThe exercise delivered intriguing results. The exhibit gives the impression of a combo of Rorschach test images augmented by delicately drawn lines. It makes for beguiling and thought-provoking viewing. “I pondered what they meant to me. Then the war came, and they immediately turned into explosions for me,” says the artist about the splashy blot-like shapes that look a little like dancers shaking a muscular leg or two. The linear element followed. “I consolidated that sense by adding lines which accentuate the feeling of powerful explosions moving up and down.”\nVISITORS TO the gallery will, no doubt, get the air of national trauma, but they will also have plenty to spark their emotions and appreciation of well-crafted aesthetics. Some impart the dark zeitgeist more palpably than others. Take, for example, Penina Shalvi’s totemic figure, which seems wary and frightening in equal amounts. Shalvi references the subconscious in her artist notes and borrows from feted psychologist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung to support her creative venture.\n“Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is,” Jung argued, adding that untended emotional baggage can cause problems. “At all counts, it forms an unconscious snag, thwarting our most well-meant intentions.”\nRuth Schreiber’s diptych provides the most direct reference to the war and personal emotional shock waves. The double collage exhibit comes from a six-part series of self-portraits created between October and November this year. They feature images lifted from news reports about the war, betwixt pictures of the artist’s grandchildren. “I try to protect them from the destructive news, but at the same time, I also need to follow the news myself.”\nThat is a challenging dichotomy indeed, although one may question the necessity to constantly stay abreast of developments here. Be that as it may, Schreiber does the evocative and emotive business, particularly with the deft inclusion of Edvard Munch’s iconic Scream in various guises.\nPeled also weighs in with a series of wood etchings that manage to conjure up all sorts of feelings and thoughts about the way things stand. In recent years, she has increasingly drawn on her own surroundings and the scenes she catches as she moves around the capital. She says she likes the elbow grease demands of chiseling away and scoring pieces of wood as she creates images that ebb and flow between the figurative and the abstract.\nShe spells out her take on the ongoing violence in these parts. One of her four exhibits at the gallery, a fetching abstract work, comprises two black-brown rectangles, which have been given a good going over by Peled. They are connected by a splash of red – a frank reference to bloodshed – with the penciled-in words “bloody war” repeated numerous times in the center. The color scheme also dovetails neatly with Adar’s neighboring anemones.\nWorking as a collective clearly offers the advantage of having your own solo spot on a regular, rotational basis. But when the members come together in a group setting, the synergic rewards come through loud and clear. Returning is an emotive tour de force that offers compelling viewing and a chance to take a different vantage point on the way things are panning out here. ❖",

    "text": "OTTAWA, May 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As catastrophic events like floods and fires become more frequent and severe, Canada needs a new approach to supporting community recovery, according to\nnew research from The Conference Board of Canada, developed in partnership with the Canadian Red Cross, Insurance Bureau of Canada, and Public Safety Canada. The four organizations are advancing disaster recovery research through the Canadian Resilient Recovery Initiative (CRRI).\n“The impact of catastrophic events on Canadian communities are increasing, but our approach to managing risk and recovery is not keeping up with the changing circumstances,” stated Babatunde Olateju, Associate Director of Sustainability, The Conference Board of Canada. “Working collaboratively with non-governmental stakeholders and the private sector, government officials need to develop comprehensive frameworks and policy tools that help communities recover from disaster events and build resilience to future risks.”\nThe research builds on Canada’s recently released National Adaptation Strategy, which commits to developing a disaster recovery strategy by 2028. It looks to disaster recovery frameworks and programs in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand to identify principles and practices that should be incorporated into a whole-of-society, made-in-Canada approach to resilient recovery.\n“Every year, the Red Cross assists thousands of Canadians impacted by the increasing number of climate events in Canada. And every year, we see that return to home following an event is longer, more complicated, and more costly than people expect,” said Amy Avis, Chief of Humanitarian Services at the Canadian Red Cross. “The Red Cross welcomes this research partnership with the Conference Board, Public Safety Canada and the Insurance Bureau of Canada to bring to light challenges and propose meaningful solutions for change including the development of a national recovery framework.”\n“With climate change increasingly impacting Canadians’ well-being and livelihoods, ensuring a strong recovery after disasters hit is crucial. I welcome the release of this report and its contribution to the examination of Canada’s disaster recovery landscape. I am pleased to see that the findings align with Public Safety’s ongoing work to introduce a modernized Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) program in the coming year. The new DFAA, focused on resilient recovery to support provinces and territories, also shows how we are delivering on climate change priorities through the National Adaptation Strategy. Our work reflects the need to ensure we build resilient communities in the face of more frequent and severe disasters”. – The Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada.\nThe CRRI is a multi-year initiative aimed at understanding the diverse dimensions of community resilience and developing the capabilities needed to recover effectively from catastrophic disasters. Future research will focus on topics related to equity, Indigenous-led recovery, and the economic impacts of disaster events.\nMedia Contact\nThe Conference Board of Canada\nE-mail:\nmedia@conferenceboard.ca\nTel: 613-526-3090 ext. 224\nAbout The Conference Board of Canada\nThe Conference Board of Canada is the country’s leading independent research organization.

    "text": "Why Special Education Is the Absolute Best Teaching Gig In the realm of education, there are many rewarding and fulfilling careers to choose from. However, when it comes to the absolute best teaching gig, special education stands head and shoulders above the rest. Here’s why special education is undoubtedly the most rewarding and satisfying option for educators. 1. Changing Lives Every Day As a special education teacher, you have the power to make a significant impact on the lives of children with disabilities. Through your guidance, these students can overcome obstacles and achieve success in their academic and personal endeavors. The difference you make in their lives is tangible, lending immense satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment to your daily work. 2. Embracing Individuality Special education allows teachers to truly appreciate and celebrate each student’s uniqueness. Rather than trying to fit students into a standard mold, you collaborate with them to establish personalized learning goals and strategies. This fosters authentic connections with your students, as you work towards their growth as unique individuals. 3. Creative Problem Solving In special education, one size does not fit all – every student requires tailored approaches to meet their specific needs. This encourages creativity in designing lesson plans and instructional methods that can engage students no matter their ability level. This continuous process of problem solving keeps the work fresh and invigorating. 4. Strong Sense of Community Special education teachers form close bonds with their colleagues, parents, and support staff. Working together as a team towards a common goal fosters strong camaraderie among professionals who share the same passion for special education. This peer network provides invaluable support and motivation throughout your career. 5. Job Stability and Demand There is always a high demand for skilled special education teachers around the globe, providing job stability in an otherwise volatile job market. With proper credentials and experience, you can explore opportunities in various educational settings such as public schools, private institutions, or even consultative roles. 6. Opportunities for Professional Growth The field of special education is constantly evolving, offering myriad opportunities to develop your skills and expertise. As an educator, you can engage in ongoing professional development courses, conferences, and workshops to stay updated with the latest advancements in education and technology. 7. Emotional Rewards Witnessing the progress and development of your students is immensely gratifying. The genuine appreciation from students, parents, and colleagues reinforce the value of your work and the positive impact you have on many lives. In conclusion, special education is without a doubt the best teaching gig when considering its potential for life-changing impact on students, strong community support, and numerous opportunities for growth. As a special education teacher, you’ll find that few other careers offer as much personal fulfillment and professional satisfaction – making it a truly exceptional choice in the world of education.",

    "text": "Attentat islamiste déjoué au concert de Taylor Swift à Vienne (Autriche) : les suspects sont d’origine turque, l’un travaillait à l’intérieur du stade (Màj : Beran A., 19 ans, ne montre aucun remords et voulait tuer autant « d’infidèles » que possible) Catégorie : [Global](https://nantes.indymedia.org/posts/global/) Thèmes : [Les bougnoules dehors !](https://nantes.indymedia.org/about/les-bougnoules-dehors/) Lieux : [Vienne](https://nantes.indymedia.org/in/vienne/) Selon l’enquête de police, un Viennois de 17 ans d’origine turco-croate et un Austro-Turc de 15 ans sont également susceptibles d’avoir été impliqués dans ses plans. Le complice de 17 ans aurait commencé à travailler pour une entreprise d’installations il y a quelques jours seulement, qui était également active lors du concert de Taylor Swift. Il a été arrêté mercredi au stade de Vienne. Il ne montre aucun remords et voulait tuer autant d’”infidèles » que possible Selon la police, le principal auteur de l’infraction, Beran A. (Photo), âgé de 19 ans, a pleinement avoué. Il ne montre aucun remords. Sa cible était « les infidèles de Vienne », a-t-il expliqué lors de son interrogatoire. Un jeune homme de 19 ans originaire de Ternitz (Basse-Autriche) a été arrêté. Il a avoué. Il s’est donné le nom de guerre « Mo » en allusion au prophète Mahomet. Il s’agit du jeune homme de 19 ans surnommé « Mo » qui a été arrêté à Ternitz, en Basse-Autriche. Dans sa maison, les deux hommes s’étaient préparés à l’attaque. Comme indiqué, plusieurs substances chimiques et appareils techniques ont été saisis lors d’une perquisition à domicile mercredi. Le jeune homme aurait volé les produits chimiques de son ancien employeur, une entreprise de métallurgie. Les explosifs ont été détruits sur place. Entre autres choses, de la fausse monnaie, des stéroïdes anabolisants, des armes tranchantes et poignardantes et une lumière bleue ont également été découverts. Le téléphone portable saisi contenait notamment du matériel de l’EI et des instructions sur la fabrication de bombes et d’explosifs. « Il a clairement exprimé ses convictions en ligne », a déclaré le chef de la Direction de la sécurité de l’Etat et du renseignement (DSN), Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, lors d’une conférence de presse. Il avait « visiblement changé d’apparence et l’avait adaptée à l’EI ». Des tendances à l’égard d’Al-Qaïda sont également envisageables. Les trois concerts de la star américaine Taylor Swift prévus à Vienne cette semaine sont annulés, ont annoncé mercredi 7 août les organisateurs, après que la police autrichienne a révélé des projets d’attentats islamistes. “Avec la confirmation par les autorités d’un projet d’attaque terroriste au stade Ernst Happel, nous n’avons pas d’autre choix que d’annuler les trois concerts pour la sécurité de tous”, a expliqué Barracuda Music sur Instagram, ajoutant que les tickets seraient automatiquement remboursés “dans un délai de 10 jours”. (…) Les forces de l’ordre ont découvert au domicile de l’une des deux personnes interpellées “des substances chimiques” (…) Le jeune homme était de connivence avec une autre personne. (…) La police autrichienne a arrêté mercredi un suspect de 19 ans qui nourrissait des projets d’attentats islamistes dans la région de Vienne, en lien notamment avec les concerts de la star américaine Taylor Swift prévus en fin de semaine. Un citoyen autrichien ayant «prêté allégeance» au groupe djihadiste Etat islamique (EI) a été interpellé, a déclaré lors d’une conférence de presse le directeur général de la Sécurité publique, Franz Ruf, faisant état «d’actes préparatoires avec une focalisation sur les concerts de Taylor Swift à Vienne».",

    "text": "Advertisements\nAdvertising Space – “Top”: $100 per month\nGetty Images; Tyler Le/BI\nDeborah has fast become one of Nicole Ramirez’s favorite colleagues. She’s quick to deliver compliments, sharp-witted, and hyper-efficient. Perhaps best of all, there’s no internal competition with Deborah at the health marketing agency they work for, because she isn’t on the payroll. She isn’t even human .\nRamirez, a 34-year-old who lives in the Pittsburgh area, says she randomly chose the name Deborah as a way to refer to the generative AI app ChatGPT , which she began using about a year ago to help her with basic tasks like drafting emails. As time went on, she asked Deborah to do more complex work, such as market research and analysis, and found herself typing “thank you” after the results came back. Eventually the relationship got to the point where the app became akin to a coworker who’s always willing to give feedback — or listen to her gripes about real-life clients and colleagues. And so the bot became a bud .\n“Those are things that you would usually turn to your work bestie over lunch about when you can go to ChatGPT — or Deborah, in my case,” says Ramirez.\nPeople are treating AI chatbots as more than just 24/7 therapists and loyal companions. With the tools becoming ubiquitous in the workplace, some are regarding them as model colleagues, too.\nUnlike teammates with a pulse, chatbots are never snotty, grumpy, or off the clock. They don’t eat leftover salmon at their desks or give you the stink eye. They don’t go on a tangent about their kids or talk politics when you ask to schedule a meeting. And they won’t be insulted if you reject their suggestions.\nFor many, tapping AI chatbots in lieu of their human colleagues has deep appeal. Consider that nearly one-third of US workers would rather clean a toilet than ask a colleague for help, according to a recent survey from the Center for Generational Kinetics, a thought-leadership firm, and commissioned by workplace-leadership strategist Henna Pryor. Experts warn, though, that too much bot bonding could dull social and critical-thinking skills, hurting careers and company performance.\nIn the past two years, the portion of US employees who say they have used Gen AI in their role a few times a year or more nearly doubled to 40% from 21%, according to a Gallup report released in June. Part of what accounts for that rapid ascendance is how much Gen AI reflects our humanity, as Stanford University lecturer Martin Gonzalez concluded in a 2024 research paper. “Instead of a science-fiction-like ball of pulsing light, we encounter human quirks: poems recited in a pirate’s voice, the cringeworthy humor of dad jokes,” wrote Gonzalez, who’s now an executive at Google’s AI research lab DeepMind.\nOne sign that people see AI agents as lifelike is in how they politely communicate with the tools by using phrases like “please” or “thank you,” says Connie Noonan Hadley, an organizational psychologist and professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business.\nLike junk food, it’s efficient when you need it, but too much over time can give you relational diabetes. Laura Greve, clinical health psychologist\n“So far, people are keeping up with basic social niceties,” she says. “AI tends to give you compliments, too, so there are some social skills still being maintained.”\nHuman colleagues, on the other hand, aren’t always as well-mannered.\nMonica Park, a graphic designer for a jeweler in New York, used to dread showing early mock-ups of her work to colleagues. She recalls the heartache she felt after a coworker at a previous employer angrily responded to a draft of a design she’d drawn with an F-bomb.\n“You never know if it’s a good time to ask for feedback,” Park, 32, tells me. “So much of it has to do with the mood of the person looking at it.”\nLast year she became a regular ChatGPT user and says that while the app will also dish out criticism, it’s only the constructive kind. “It’s not saying it in a malicious or judgmental way,” Park says. “ChatGPT doesn’t have any skin in the game.”\nAaron Ansari, an information-security consultant, counts Anthropic’s AI chatbot Claude among his top peers. The 46-year-old Orlando-area resident likes that he can ask it to revise a document as many times as he wants without being expected to give anything in return. By contrast, a colleague at a previous job would pressure him to buy Girl Scout cookies from her kids whenever he stopped by her desk.\n“It became her reputation,” Ansari says. “You can’t go to ‘Susie’ without money.”\nNow a managing partner at a different consulting firm, he finds himself opening Claude before pinging colleagues for support. This way, he can avoid ruffling any feathers, like when he once attempted to reach a colleague in a different time zone at what turned out to be an inconvenient hour.\n“You call and catch them in the kitchen,” says Ansari. “I have interrupted their lunch unintentionally, but they certainly let me know.”\nAI’s appeal can be so strong that workers are at risk of developing unhealthy attachments to chatbots, research shows. “ Your Brain on ChatGPT ,” a study published in June from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that the convenience that AI agents provide can weaken people’s critical-thinking skills and foster procrastination and laziness.\n“Like junk food, it’s efficient when you need it, but too much over time can give you relational diabetes,” says Laura Greve, a clinical health psychologist in Boston. “You’re starved of the nutrients you need, the real human connection.”\nAnd if workers at large overindulge in AI, we could all end up becoming “emotionally unintelligent oafs,” she warns. “We’re accidentally training an entire generation to be workplace hermits.”\nIn turn, Hadley adds, businesses that rely on collaboration could suffer. “The more workers turn to AI instead of other people, the greater the chance the social fabric that weaves us together will weaken,” she says.\nKaren Loftis, a senior product manager in a Milwaukee suburb, recently left a job at a large tech company that’s gone all-in on AI. She said before ChatGPT showed up, sales reps would call her daily for guidance on how to plug the company’s latest products. That’s when they’d learn about her passion for seeing musicians like Peter Frampton in concert.\nBut when she saw the singer-songwriter perform earlier this year, it was “like a non-event,” she said, because those calls almost entirely stopped coming in. “With AI, it’s all work and no relationships,” she said.\nWorkers who lean heavily on AI may also be judged differently by their peers than their bosses.\nColleagues are more inclined to see them as dependent on the technology, less creative, and lacking growth potential, says David De Cremer, a behavioral scientist and Dunton Family Dean of Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business. “It’s objectification by association,” he says.\nCompany leaders, however, are more likely to view workers who demonstrate AI chops as assets. Big-company CEOs such as Amazon’s Andy Jassy and Shopify’s Tobi Lütke have credited the technology for boosting productivity and cost savings.",
