    "text": "Ester Cunio, una abuela argentina de 90 años, evitó ser secuestrada por Hamás en Israel gracias a que mencionó ser del país del futbolista Lionel Messi.

[Elecciones 2024: [Sigue aquí los pasos de los candidatos a la Presidencia](https://www.unotv.com/elecciones-2024-en-mexico/)] Abuelita se salva de secuestro de Hamás en Israel gracias a Messi Ester relató cómo ella y su familia estuvieron en peligro, cuando terroristas irrumpieron en su hogar en el kibutz israelí Nir Oz. A pesar de la amenaza y el miedo, Ester pensó ágilmente y se le ocurrió mencionar a Messi durante una conversación con uno de los terroristas, lo que provocó un cambio de actitud en él. “No me hables, le dije. Yo no sé tu idioma árabe. Yo hablo en argentino, en castellano. Entonces me dijo: ¿qué es Argentina? A lo que le respondí: Ves Futbol, y él dijo que sí. Entonces le dije: Yo soy de donde es Messi. Él se sorprendió y me pidió una foto”.Ester Cunio El nombre del reconocido futbolista argentino logró desarmar al terrorista y llevar a una situación más pacífica, permitiendo que Ester y su familia evitaran el secuestro.

El documental busca preservar testimonios importantes para las generaciones futuras, destacando la valentía y la humanidad en medio del conflicto. Durante la entrevista que le realizan a Ester, ella menciona lo que le diría a Messi si él se enterará de su caso: “Si él (Messi) sabe que yo lo mencioné y por él me salvé, ahora le pediría por mis dos nietos que están ahí encerrados. No los podemos sacar todavía”.Ester Cunio El incidente destaca la importancia de la solidaridad y la empatía en momentos difíciles. Aunque Ester pudo salvarse gracias a mencionar a Messi, la historia nos recuerda que muchas otras personas se encuentran situaciones difíciles y aún no logran recuperar su libertad.",

    "title": "AI Images May Be Changing the Way We Look at Food",
    "text": "On Sunday, Justine Moore, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted about a curious discovery. It was an Instagram account with the handle @ethos_atx, which purported to represent an upscale restaurant called Ethos in Austin, Texas. But, as Moore noted, no such business exists — despite the account’s tens of thousands of followers and blue verification checkmark. And all the food on the page (along with pictures of “staff”) is AI -generated.\nThis restaurant does not exist.\nEthos, which claims to be Austin’s #1 restaurant, has 72k followers on IG.\nIt seems normal until you realize the photos of the food + venue are AI.\nThe posts get thousands of likes and comments from people who have no idea. pic.twitter.com/YQC2OFGIB4\n— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) October 13, 2024 The comments on Ethos’ posts about outlandish foods like an arm-sized sausage or pizza in the shape of a foot (“feetza”) are a mix of generic praise from bots, a few seemingly authentic replies from gullible followers, and — at this point — lots of people bewildered that anyone could mistake the phony images for actual meals. It’s still not clear who runs the Ethos page, but they seem to intend it as an elaborate joke: there’s a post about Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos serving cocktails at the bar because he came in last in a fantasy football league, and the linked website claims that reservations become available at “ 4:30 a.m. of the first Monday of every month ,” in a satirical swipe at overhyped bougie eateries. It also appears the prankster has found a way to monetize their gag, selling Ethos T-shirts with winking catchphrases like “Unreal Flavors.”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Ethos (@ethos_atx)\nBut beyond this particular stunt, AI-generated food content has infected the culinary side of the internet in more troubling ways. Over on Facebook , a platform that has effectively incentivized all manner of weird AI spam , cooking pages are rife with AI pictures that supposedly show the finished results of a particular recipe. A page called “Recipes formula,” for example, features a profile picture of a “chef” who has an inexplicable third hand and shares image after image of dishes whose texture and color are just slightly uncanny — if you know what to look for. These are paired with text recipes either directly copied from other websites or generated by AI programs that have scraped such material. (That in itself is something of a problem for home cooks in an age when Google AI is recommending Elmer’s glue as an ingredient for tomato sauce.) Despite all this, the page has 44,000 followers.\nA similar Facebook page, “Cook Fastly,” uncovered by the pseudonymous data researcher and software developer Conspirador Norteño this week, gives the name of its non-existent female author as “David” (though a separate website identifies her as “Lojaine”). It, too, courts engagement from tens of thousands of subscribers with images of dinners and baked goods that have a sort of immaculate sheen you wouldn’t see on real food. Of course, there are occasionally more glaring clues to the artifice, as when the AI model fails to replicate the Oreo logo .\nIt wasn’t long ago that AI struggled to reliably produce food that stirred our appetites at all, more often generating freakish and off-putting fare . Yet in an academic paper published by the journal Food Quality and Preference earlier this year, researchers found that AI models tended to make food “appear somewhat glossier and with warmer and more uniform lighting,” enhancing its appeal. In fact, participants in the study rated AI-generated images as “more appetizing than real photos” when not informed of which images were fake and which were authentic. While participants were also fairly good at spotting AI material — especially when the models tried to mimic ultra-processed food like fries and milkshakes — psychologist Charles Spence of the University of Oxford, who co-authored the paper, warned of the potential consequences of brands and creators in the food industry relying on this tech.\n“While AI-generated visuals may offer cost-saving opportunities for marketers and the industry by reducing the cost of commissioning food photoshoots, these findings highlight potential risks associated with exacerbating ‘visual hunger’ amongst consumers — the phenomenon where viewing images of food triggers appetite and cravings,” Spence said in an interview on his work. “This could potentially influence unhealthy eating behaviors or foster unrealistic expectations about food among consumers.”\nThe gap between perception of food and the reality has already become an issue in the business of meal delivery. The Indian delivery company Zomato, for instance, recently announced an anti-AI stance and encouraged its restaurant partners to do the same, citing “concerns over customer trust and the negative impact on business.” Its CEO, Deepinder Goyal, vowed to “actively start removing such images from menus” and use automation tools to “detect and reject” new ones. Taking the exact opposite approach, the delivery company Foodora, which services countries in northern and central Europe, said earlier this year that it was “implementing AI to elevate our partners’ photos.”\nThat decision produced some disastrous results, with Foodora users soon noticing aberrations including sandwiches depicted as plain baguettes and a plate of fried butterflied shrimp where an AI model spat out butterfly shapes that had the visual the texture of cooked shrimp. The company told media outlets that they had been conducting “tests” with AI tools and were taking steps to remove the bogus images.\nIt’s just more evidence — as if we needed it — that no sector of online life is safe from the scourge of AI garbage. Even far from the morass of toxic politics, misinformation and conspiracy theories, this software is eroding our trust in what’s true and displacing it with bizarre hallucinations. Tech evangelists may still believe in the transformative power of an ongoing AI revolution, but for everyone else, the gimmick is starting to leave a bitter taste.",

    "text": "\nPatriarch Kirill’s ‘pseudo-religion’ is denounced by Ukrainian bishops\nA burnt-out Russian tank seen last week in a street in Svyatogirsk, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine\nUKRAINIAN Churches have marked the second anniversary of Russia’s assault on their country with appeals for a realistic understanding of the conflict and continued international support.\n“It’s been ten years since Russia unleashed its deliberately planned brutal and bloody war — hatred should be called hatred, while murder is murder and war is war,” the Primate of the Ukrainian independent Orthodox Church (OCU), Metropolitan Epiphany (Dumenko), said in a social-media post this week.\n“In the 21st century, an authoritarian country, with over half a million troops and destructive weapons, attacked another peaceful, independent state, violating all international rules and agreements. Terror, destruction, and extermination continue round the clock, as Russia pursues its planned genocide of a free, democratic people.”\nThe message was published as services took place nationwide to commemorate the second anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion, and the tenth anniversary of its forced annexation of Crimea and occupation of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\nMetropolitan Epiphany said that Russia had talked of “liberating”, “helping”, and “protecting” the local population, while many Ukrainians had initially failed to grasp the full impact of what was occurring.\n“Lies disarm and make people vulnerable, whereas the truth, however bitter, should be spoken and warned about openly,” he said. “It’s important to call things by their real names, to speak the truth, reject lies, and avoid fear and deception — in the eyes of the international community, Russia has committed a great crime against the Ukrainian people.”\nThe Metropolitan issued his appeal as Russian forces secured the newly captured town of Avdiivka, and launched fresh missile and drone attacks this week. The European Union announced a 13th package of sanctions amid continuing Ukrainian complaints of dwindling military support.\nUkraine’s Greek Catholic bishops said that “crimes by the Russian state and Church” had left “no room for compromise”, and that the international community had made a “great mistake” in enabling Moscow to construct a new “hybrid totalitarianism”.\n“This war bears all the features of a neo-colonial war, with clear signs of genocide — the destruction of Ukrainianness has become the Russian leadership’s political programme, with a mania indicating the unhealthy state of Russian society,” the bishops said in a statement on Tuesday.\n“Modern Russian totalitarianism does not pretend to have a positive content and coherent theory. It is the propaganda of nihilism in its worst forms, which seeks mankind’s moral corruption and dehumanisation, undermining faith in any moral principles and tempting its subjects to commit violence against others with impunity.”\nInternational efforts have continued to deter Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada parliament from enacting a law banning Orthodox communities that maintain jurisdictional ties with Moscow, which has been portrayed by Russia as religious persecution.\nIn a statement on Monday, the Moscow Patriarchate said that Ukraine’s Moscow-linked Orthodox Church, the UOC, had spoken of “numerous violations of believers’ rights in Ukraine”. It went on to say that the Ukrainian government was “disseminating false information” and “trying to hide its violations” from world opinion.\nUkrainian MPs confirmed this week, however, that work was continuing on the planned Bill to ensure its conformity with European Commission requirements.\nUkrainian appeal courts rejected legal appeals this week by Metropolitans Ionafan (Yeletsky) of Tulchyn, and Feodosiy (Snegiryov) of Cherkasy, who are among dozens of UOC clergy convicted or facing charges for supporting the Russian invasion.\nIn a statement last weekend, Metropolitan Epiphany’s independent OCU said that it would seek to draw attention to the Russian Orthodox Church’s complicity in crimes in occupied Ukrainian territory, after one of its priests, the Revd Stepan Podolchuk, was summarily shot near Kherson.\nIn their declaration, the Greek Catholic bishops of Ukraine said that the Russian Orthodox Church was “trying to fill the ideological vacuum left from the fall of Communism”, using religion as a political tool to “strengthen state power”.\nPatriarch Kirill’s contribution to the “propaganda of war” conformed, they said, with the Church’s “tradition of ideological service” and “servility towards those in power”. They said that no compromise could be reached in the conflict “if one of the parties denies the very existence of the other”.\n“Ukrainian society has long tried to convey to the international community that a new aggressive ideology is emerging in Russia, which is a mixture of resentment, nationalism, and pseudo-religious messianism,” the bishops said.\n“The Moscow Patriarchate’s role in creating and promoting this ideology with a quasi-religious spirit is now well-known and indisputable, portraying Russia as Christianity’s last bastion on earth, standing against the forces of evil.”\nTHE depleted Anglican community in Kyiv has survived a year of full-scale war and is still attracting new members, according to a long-standing Ukrainian member\nIn a statement after the Archbishop of Canterbury’s visit to Ukraine (News, 16 February), Christian Aid said that 14.6 million Ukrainians currently needed humanitarian assistance, and millions were living in damaged homes and buildings unprotected against the harsh winter. The charity urged Western aid donors “not to give up on the people of Ukraine”.\nThe diocese in Europe is still funding refugee-support projects in co-operation with the USPG; but the small Anglican community in the parish of Christ Church, Kyiv, was still appealing for prayers.\n“The outcome of the Ukraine war is of profound importance to the future of our European continent — the Ukrainian people are paying the price of this war in blood, tears and trauma”, the Bishop in Europe, Dr Robert Innes, said in the diocesan announcement.\n“For them, this is an existential struggle, and I urge everyone to continue supporting Ukrainians, whether in Ukraine or in other host countries, by whatever means they can.”\nUkraine’s Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, which groups Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant leaders, as well as Jews and Muslims, paid tribute to the population’s “heroic resistance” and the support provided by “international partners”, in a message on Monday. It also announced plans for a nationwide campaign of prayer and fasting from 1 to 3 March.\n07 Feb 2024\n14 Feb 2024\n27 Oct 2023\n03 Nov 2023\n02 Feb 2024\n05 Feb 2024\n21 Feb 2024\n23 Feb 2024\n16 Feb 2024\nSneering at a new Live Aid show has political repercussions, argues Paul Vallely\nOur benefice of four rural churches is situated in a glorious part of the East Riding of Yorkshire just a few miles north of the very attractive Georgian town of Beverley.\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury and ECC seek to appoint a House for Duty Priest at Ruxley\nA safe harbour – open to God, inclusive of all\nA three-church parish in the heart of Bournemouth, ten minutes from the beach.

    "title": "A partir del 12 de mayo se habilitará el pago QR con billeteras virtuales en el transporte público - Infobae",
    "text": "A partir del 12 de mayo, las empresas de transporte público podrán recibir pagos con código QR realizados por billeteras virtuales, según una reglamentación dictada hoy por el BCRA. La resolución dispone un nuevo estándar de pagos QR para permitir que los pasajeros, como alternativa a la tarjeta SUBE, puedan tener más opciones para pagar.\nMediante este sistema, todas las billeteras digitales interoperables registradas ante el Banco Central podrán ofrecer a sus clientes el pago de los boletos de subtes, trenes y colectivos en aquellas plataformas que acepten la modalidad QR.\nBajo el nombre Viaje con QR (VQR) el sistema quedará habilitado desde el 12 de mayo y, a partir de allí, las empresas de transporte deberán adaptar sus máquinas validadoras para recibir pagos con QR, tal como ya lo están haciendo para los pagos con tarjeta. Para hacerlo, será obligatorio usar el estándar fijado hoy por el BCRA.\nPara el usuario que quiera pagar con su celular usando QR, el sistema prevé dos cuestiones centrales. El primero es que el pago QR en el transporte público no es el mismo que se utiliza en los comercios . El sistema a utilizar es mucho más rápido: el usuario debe generar el código QR en su billetera digital y lo acerca al lector de la máquina validadora del molinete o del colectivo, que lo lee de inmediato.\nEl segundo punto es que no será necesario que el celular del usuario tenga conexión a Internet al momento de pagar. Esa es otra diferencia central con el pago QR que habitualmente se hace en los comercios.\nInicialmente, el transporte público se podrá pagar con QR con fondos desde cuentas bancarias (CBU) y o de billeteras virtuales (CVU). Todavía no se permitirá pagar con tarjetas vía QR.\nCon esta decisión, el Banco Central puso fin a una controversia que se había desatado entre las billeteras virtuales . Las competidoras de Mercado Pago , la billetera líder del sistema, se habían quejado de que en su doble rol de billetera y adquirente, podía sacar ventajas sobre el resto. Con el plazo dispuesto hoy, se entiende que todas las billeteras que ingresen al negocio tendrán el tiempo necesario para adaptar su funcionamiento al estándar que fijó el Central.\nEn el BCRA explicaron que el sistema tiene dos actores principales: las billeteras digitales, tanto bancarias como de fintech, y los administradores QR, que procesan los pagos con los lectores de QR en los puntos de acceso al transporte. Mercado Pago opera en las dos actividades; de hecho, ganó la licitación de Subterráneos de Buenos Aires (Sbase) para ser “adquirente” en los subtes porteños. Por ello, en el subte ya se habilitó con éxito el pago con tarjetas de débito y de crédito pero todavía no con QR, ya que se esperaba esta resolución del Central.\n“Todo sistema de transporte público que desee cobrar con código QR deberá adoptar el estándar regulado por el BCRA”, explicaron en el BCRA.\nNoticia en desarrollo",

    "text": "Doctor Who’s Russell T. Davies Reveals The One Note Disney Had For Ncuti Gatwa’s Christmas Special, And I’m Happy He Agreed With It [News](https://www.cinemablend.com/news) [Mike Reyes](https://www.cinemablend.com/author/mike-reyes) It's amazing how the present can unexpectedly mirror the past. As anyone with a [Disney+ subscription](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492773/how-to-best-use-disney-tips-to-get-the-most-out-of-the-streaming-service) will tell you, the latest wave of Doctor Who specials has been a rollercoaster ride of reactions and revelations. With “The Church on Ruby Road” acting as the first Christmas special in a while, showrunner [Russell T. Davies](https://www.cinemablend.com/tag/russell-t-davies)’ vision was pretty much intact, save for one particular note the new producing partner had for Ncuti Gatwa's first full episode as The Doctor. Frankly, I’m happy that Davies agreed, as it made sure Ncuti Gatwa’s Doctor was in the show as soon as possible. That's because this tweak, involving Fifteen's entrance, inadvertently reflected Russell's past in the Doctor Who canon. Disney’s Note On How Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor Was Introduced BBC’s ongoing docu-series Doctor Who: Unleashed (via [comicbook.com](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/doctor-who-showrunner-disney-plus-holiday-episode/)) saw the once and current showrunner admitting that Disney actually did have a note for the 2023 Christmas special. And as he revealed through his own remarks, Davies admitted that the new Doctor Who partner actually had a point: While we do see Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor in small moments throughout “The Church on Ruby Road,” the moment added at the last moment occurs roughly eight minutes into the special. This allowed Gatwa to spring into full Doctor action early, and it’s a moment that shows off the charm and authority this Time Lord’s new face fully commands. But looking closer at how Doctor Who’s latest offering is timed, I once again totally agree that Russell T. Davies added this scene. Especially when part of that moment includes this gem of an interaction: Without The Doctor getting “snowmanned” in order to save a pedestrian, it appears that they wouldn’t have shown up until around the 19:12 mark. That’s when Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday jumps onto that ladder to the Goblin airship, resulting in the hysterically fitting conversation that takes place between Doctor and Companion, as they respectively run and drift above the ground. Though [Ncuti Gatwa’s pants-free bi-generation scene](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/doctor-who-tiktok-ncuti-gatwa-how-david-tennant-blame-pants-free-scene) was our proper introduction to the character, that still seems a bit of a stretch for a Doctor Who adventure to not bring The Doctor properly into the fold. It makes even more sense for this Disney-suggested tweak to have taken place, as Davies’ history in making an entrance with the character has shown in hindsight. Why Disney's Doctor Who Tweak Made Perfect Sense Looking back at when Russell T. Davies first reintroduced The Doctor in 2005, the timing of Fifteen’s modified entrance feels even more proper. It’s roughly seven and a half minutes into “Rose,” one of the many Doctor Who episodes available through a [Max subscription](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2570432/subscribing-to-hbo-max-what-to-know-about-the-price-options-and-what-the-streaming-service-offers), that we see Christopher Eccleston’s Ninth Doctor swoop in for the first time to save young Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). Considering that this was the grand reintroduction of this pop culture icon, after nine years of inactivity, one would have expected that moment to be properly goosed for all its worth. It's a balancing act that takes place whenever a new Doctor arrives, and it just so happens that this latest Russell T. Davies starter arrived at that conclusion with some gentle outside nudging. The more I think about it, the more there’s room for parallels between Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor and the Ninth Doctor. Between the wardrobe, the introduction, and the bittersweet recollection of his past that acted as one of the [takeaways from “The Church on Ruby Road,”](https://www.cinemablend.com/streaming-news/doctor-who-christmas-special-takeaways-ncuti-gatwa-first-full-episode) there’s a familiar energy that’s making its way into the Doctor Who fabric, with a new spin attached. While I’m still a bit shaky on how much I’ll enjoy this new era of Russell T. Davies, there’s still a lot of promise in the air for what’s to come. This brings us to the crushing realization that Doctor Who won’t be back in action until we hit the spring collection of the [2024 TV schedule](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2024-tv-show-premiere-dates-schedule). Though should you have read through this rundown without watching the episode, and would like to know [how to stream “The Church on Ruby Road,”](https://www.cinemablend.com/streaming-news/watch-doctor-who-the-church-on-ruby-road-2023-christmas-special#section-watch-doctor-who-the-church-on-ruby-road-online-in-the-uk) that information is as readily available as the force of mavity.
