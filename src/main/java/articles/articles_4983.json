    "text": "A mum's heart was left in tatters after her daughter's birthday party was met with a devastating lack of attendees, leading her to question the very essence of human kindness. She had meticulously planned a celebration for her little girl, inviting their nearest and dearest, yet, in a turn of events that would sadden any parent, none of the child's friends appeared on the day.\nIn a heartfelt Reddit post, the mum shared: \"I just need to know if I'm overreacting here. My daughter's birthday party was two days ago and I'm still feeling upset.\" \"I invited a few people and they told me they were coming but the day of the party, everyone either bailed last minute or just didn't show up. The only people that came were my parents, brother, my aunt and my cousin there were no kids for her to play with.\"\nDespite the setback, her daughter found joy in the day, which should have been enough for the mother, yet she confessed: \"She was happy and had a great time regardless and that's all that should matter but I just can't seem to get over this feeling of disappointment and abandonment.\"\nRead More Related Articles One user commented on her post, saying: \"Being left hanging in any situation let alone your daughter's birthday party is always going to sting. You're not overreacting, if they all confirmed and then didn't show up with little or no notice I'm not surprised you feel the way you do. Hopefully they will apologise and makeup for it in the future, but don't beat yourself up if your expectations are low! Happy birthday to your daughter.\"\nAnother added: \"Been there, done that, once was enough. Never organised another party again. Instead I made sure to treat my kid with a better day out, going somewhere fun, or staying in and having a PJ day. Anything they wanted as long as it wasn't a party. Turns out my kid is introverted and was much happier with PJ day and movies/games.\"\nA third user chimed in: \"We want the best for our kids so it feels disappointing and really, really important that it be everything you wanted for her. Since she was happy and had a great time, it was. Great job! ! Parents, brother, aunt. and cousin came! Wow! You’re lucky to have such a supportive family. Isn’t family just the best.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\nFollow DevonLive More On Parenting",

    "text": "A Suprema Corte dos Estados Unidos rejeitou nesta quinta-feira (27) um acordo de indenização de quase 6 milhões de dólares (33 milhões de reais, na cotação atual) que exonerava a família Sackler, proprietária do laboratório farmacêutico Purdue, de futuras ações judiciais no contexto da crise dos opioides.O acordo teve cinco votos contrários e quatro favoráveis. O Departamento de Justiça reprovou que este acordo - concluído em 2022 com os 50 estados do país, coletivos locais e vítimas individuais e validado por uma corte de apelações federal - protegesse a família proprietária desse laboratório de qualquer ação, incluindo das pessoas que não aderiram ao arranjo. Os Sackler foram acusados de promover durante anos o OxyContin, medicamento contra a dor, sabendo que ele era muito viciante. A venda desse produto os fez ganhar bilhões de dólares. A prescrição excessiva do medicamento à base de opioides é amplamente considerada como o gatilho para a crise de dependência que fez mais de um bilhão de vítimas em 20 anos nos Estados Unidos. O laboratório lamentou a \\\\\\\"decisão desesperada, que invalida um acordo que teria fornecido bilhões de dólares para indenizar as vítimas\\\\\\\".Alvo de uma avalanche de ações judiciais, a Purdue entrou com pedido de falência em 2019 e, desde então, vem negociando um plano, cuja última versão prevê seu fechamento em 2024 nos EUA, para criar uma nova entidade empresarial e canalizar o pagamento de pelo menos 5,5 milhões (30 milhões de reais) em 18 anos. A Suprema Corte já havia suspendido esse acordo em agosto, a pedido do governo americano.",

    "title": "'Fired up at the incomplete room.' How the Dolphins plan to address the running back position",
    "text": "Miami Dolphins\n‘Fired up at the incomplete room.’ How the Dolphins plan to address the running back position\nThe Miami Dolphins don’t have the greatest need at running back.\nWith De’Von Achane emerging as a potential workhorse back in 2024 and rookie Jaylen Wright’s flashes of talent, there might be some who would dissuade the Dolphins from the selection of a tailback for the third straight year. Coach Mike McDaniel, however, might disagree.\n“I’m fired up at the incomplete room,” McDaniel said Tuesday, later adding “I feel extremely strong about who is in the room knowing it will grow by two to three people. I think part of our vision moving forward is we have high expectations of that tandem of De’Von and Jaylen and think that they give us an opportunity to really be effective handing the ball off and doing stuff in the pass game.”\nThe need for at least two more tailbacks stems from the Feb. 14 release of Raheem Mostert, who took a noticeable step back in 2024 after he set the franchise single-season record for touchdowns in 2023. Throw in the free agency of Jeff Wilson Jr., and it completely makes sense for the Dolphins to add another tailback. Whether it’s in the draft or via free agency remains to be seen.\n“We’ll look at that position and quite honestly look at every position, because I don’t want to be in a situation ever, and [general manager] Chris [Grier] is the exact same way, where you have an opportunity to pick somebody that is elite that you didn’t put any time into,” McDaniel said. “We’ll put in healthy time just like every other position, but I’m excited for that room even though it’s incomplete.”\nWith the Dolphins’ struggles in short yardage situations, at least on the backs added needs to be a power runner. One such running back just so happened to attend school in Coral Gables.\n“How they run wide zone, how everything’s moving with the O-line, I love it,” University of Miami’s Damien Martinez told the Miami Herald at the Senior Bowl. The 21-year-old also confirmed that he spoke with Dolphins.\nRanked No. 100 on ESPN’s big board, Martinez had back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons the last two years. He added a career-high 10 touchdowns in 2024. ESPN’s description of Martinez, courtesy of NFL Draft analyst Steve Muench, made him sound like the perfect fit for the Dolphins with either of their fourth-round picks.\n“Martinez is an efficient north-south runner between the tackles,” Muench wrote. “He’s a big and powerful back who runs through and over defenders. He pushes the pile when he doesn’t get a seam.”\nThe Dolphins took a giant step back in the run game in 2024. After Miami boasted the sixth-best rushing offense at 135.8 yards per game in 2023, they fell to 21 the following year. A large part of that drop off can be attributed to substandard play at both guard positions.\nIt remains unclear whether the Dolphins will bring back the trio of Robert Jones, Liam Eichenberg and Isaiah Wynn, the trio that manned the guard positions. If last year’s performance was any indication, the Dolphins could stand to improve there, something that McDaniel appeared ready address in the very near future.\n“I think we have a tangible opportunity to improve that starts in free agency with a couple of guys that we have targeted that you think you can get a deal done with them, and that continues into the draft,” McDaniel said. “I think it’s a very good time to have some need. We have — it’s time for us to invest in that position and excited to. That can come – I would expect it to surface itself in both free agency and the draft.”",

    "text": "El Belgrano-Talleres de hace dos semanas sigue dando qué hablar. Después del 1-1 en el campo de juego, hubo varios hechos que merecieron la atención del Cosedepro, el ente de seguridad de la provincia, que este miércoles dio a conocer sanciones.\nEste es el comunicado:\nSe informa que a partir de lo resuelto por la Mesa COSEDEPRO en el día de la fecha, y con motivo de los incidentes ocurridos en ocasión del último clásico disputado en el Estado Julio Cesar Villagra, entre Club Atlético Belgrano y Club Atlético Talleres el pasado 30 de marzo, desde el organismo provincial de Seguridad Deportiva se determinaron una serie de sanciones, basadas en el informe realizado por el jefe policial del operativo de seguridad.\nEn dicho informe, el jefe del operativo determina distintos hechos ocurridos tanto a partir de controles en el perímetro externo como así también dentro de la cancha. Los incidentes descriptos por el informe policial van desde el secuestro de banderas con inscripciones ofensivas, incidentes en el ingreso de la delegación de Talleres, el arrojo de objetos al campo de juego que además retrasaron el comienzo del partido, hasta la agresión entre jugadores, y de un hincha contra un dirigente.\nDe esta manera, COSEDEPRO resolvió aplicar una compensación institucional de 30 millones de pesos contra ambos clubes, que será destinada a instituciones que tengan como actividad principal la atención, apoyo y educación de personas con discapacidad.\nAdemás, se solicitó al Club Atlético Belgrano la identificación fehaciente del agresor que el pasado 30 de marzo agredió a un dirigente deportivo dentro de la cancha, con un plazo de diez días hábiles para responder, no descartandose nuevas sanciones. Para el agresor, se fijó la aplicación de derecho de admisión en el marco del programa Tribuna Segura, impidiendole al mismo ingresar a cualquier espactáculo deportivo realizado en el país, por un plazo de tres años.\nFinalmente, desde COSEDEPRO se solicitó a las autoridades de ambos clubes deportivos la implementación de programas y medidas institucionales que promuevan la prevención y abordaje de prácticas anti - deportivas.",

    "text": "Partager:\nLe Hamas dit étudier dans un \"esprit positif\" la dernière offre de trêve associée à la libération d'otages dans la bande de Gaza où près de sept mois de guerre meurtrière ont provoqué selon l'ONU des destructions \"sans précédent\".\nAlors que les pays médiateurs (Qatar, Egypte, Etats-Unis) attendent la réponse du Hamas à cette nouvelle proposition, des sources médicales dans la bande de Gaza ont fait état vendredi de frappes israéliennes dans le secteur de Rafah (sud).\nEt Israël a annoncé le décès d'un des otages israéliens à Gaza, Dror Or, un habitant du kibboutz Be'eri dont deux des enfants, kidnappés aussi le 7 octobre par le Hamas, avaient été libérés fin novembre dans le cadre d'une première trêve.\nCette trêve d'une semaine avait permis la libération de 105 otages contre 240 Palestiniens détenus par Israël. Depuis, les nombreuses tentatives de médiation sont restées vaines.\nLe Hamas étudie dans un \"esprit positif\" la nouvelle offre sur la table, pour une pause de 40 jours dans les combats, a déclaré jeudi son chef, Ismaïl Haniyeh, dans une conversation téléphonique avec le chef du renseignement égyptien, Abbas Kamel.\n[ Lors de cet entretien, M. Haniyeh a \"confirmé\" qu'une délégation du mouvement se rendrait en Egypte \"sous peu\" pour compléter les discussions récentes en vue d'un éventuel accord qui \"réponde aux exigences de notre peuple\" et \"mette fin à l'agression\".](../../video/jpg/4334f3e6-060b-4e40-bbe4-0e73ee37bc37.jpg)\nLe chef du Hamas, dont le mouvement est considéré comme une organisation terroriste par Israël ou encore les Etats-Unis, s'est aussi entretenu avec le ministre qatari des Affaires étrangères, à qui il a répété son souhait de \"parvenir à un accord\".\nCes propos jurent avec ceux la veille d'un responsable du mouvement qui évoquait une position pour l'instant \"négative\" du Hamas à propos de ces tractations.\nLe Hamas, qui a pris le pouvoir en 2007 à Gaza, maintient ses exigences, en premier lieu un cessez-le-feu permanent, ce qu'Israël a toujours refusé.\n- Se défendre \"seuls\" -\nEn visite mercredi en Israël, le secrétaire d'Etat américain, Antony Blinken, avait appelé le Hamas à dire \"oui\" à un accord qu'il a jugé \"extraordinairement généreux\" de la part d'Israël.\nIl a aussi exhorté Israël à renoncer à une offensive terrestre sur la ville de Rafah, dernier grand bastion du mouvement islamiste selon le Premier ministre israélien Benjamin Netanyahu, où s'entassent un million et demi de Palestiniens en majorité déplacés par la guerre.\n\"Nous ferons ce qui est nécessaire pour gagner et vaincre notre ennemi, y compris à Rafah\", a répété jeudi M. Netanyahu, après avoir promis d'y lancer une offensive terrestre, \"avec ou sans accord\" de trêve.\nDe nombreuses capitales et organisations humanitaires redoutent de lourdes pertes civiles, en l'absence d'un plan jugé crédible pour protéger la population.\n\"Si nous devons nous défendre seuls, nous nous défendrons seuls\", a-t-il dit alors que la mobilisation s'accentue dans certains pays contre Israël pour la conduite de sa guerre à Gaza.\nOutre des manifestations sur les campus de grandes universités aux Etats-Unis, au Canada, ou encore en France à Sciences Po, la Colombie a annoncé mercredi rompre ses liens diplomatiques avec Israël, et la Turquie a suspendu jeudi ses relations commerciales avec ce même pays.\nLe tout alors que des responsables israéliens commencent à craindre une possible inculpation par la Cour pénale internationale (CPI), à laquelle s'oppose toutefois leur allié américain.\nSelon les sites américain Axios et israélien Walla, des sénateurs américains ont tenu une rencontre virtuelle mercredi avec des responsables du tribunal de La Haye pour témoigner de leur préoccupation à propos de possibles mandats d'arrêt contre des dirigeants israéliens pour la guerre à Gaza.\nLe 7 octobre, une attaque de commandos du Hamas infiltrés depuis Gaza dans le sud d'Israël a entraîné la mort de 1.170 personnes, essentiellement des civils, selon un bilan de l'AFP établi à partir de données officielles israéliennes.\nPlus de 250 personnes ont été enlevées ce jour-là et 129 restent captives dans Gaza, dont 35 sont mortes, en incluant Dror Or, selon des responsables israéliens.\nEn représailles, Israël a lancé une offensive dans le territoire palestinien qui a fait 34.596 morts, majoritairement des civils, selon le ministère de la Santé du Hamas.\n- 30 à 40 milliards -\nEn plus de ce bilan humain, la reconstruction devrait coûter entre 30 et 40 milliards de dollars (entre 28 et 37 milliards d'euros), a estimé jeudi le Programme des Nations unies pour le développement (PNUD).\n\"L'ampleur de la destruction est énorme et sans précédent (...) C'est une mission à laquelle la communauté internationale n'a pas été confrontée depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale\", a déclaré le directeur du bureau régional pour les Etats arabes du PNUD, Abdallah al-Dardari.\nSur le plan de l'aide internationale, strictement contrôlée par Israël, elle continue d'arriver au compte-gouttes, principalement depuis l'Egypte, via Rafah, dans le territoire de 2,4 millions d'habitants menacé de famine.\nL'ONG américaine World Central Kitchen, qui avait suspendu ses activités dans la bande de Gaza après la mort de sept travailleurs humanitaires lors d'une frappe aérienne israélienne au début du mois d'avril, a repris cette semaine ses activités.\n\"Après la fermeture de la cuisine, nous nous sommes rendu compte que de nombreuses bouches restaient affamées\", a déclaré jeudi à l'AFP Zakria Yahya Abukuwaik, responsable d'une cuisine soutenue par cette ONG à Rafah où la population craint ces jours-ci une opération au sol des soldats israéliens à défaut d'accord de trêve.",
