    "text": "MCGREGOR, Texas — McGregor ISD has seen a drop in attendance due to a recent spike in flu cases, affecting both students and staff. Local doctors are urging precautions, including getting flu vaccinations.\nMcGregor ISD reports a significant drop in attendance, with 87% attendance over the past two weeks, compared to the usual 95%. Local doctors have seen a rise in flu cases, particularly Flu A, urging vaccinations and hygiene to reduce the spread. Flu cases in Waco-McLennan County show 196 Flu A cases and 16 Flu B cases as of Wednesday. BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:\n\" One of the things that's really difficult about the flu is just how contagious it is,” said Dr. Samuel Clark with Baylor Scott and White.\nThat's something our neighbors in McGregor are experiencing first hand.\nIn a statement, McGregor ISD Superintendent Travis Mutscher confirms attendance in the district has dropped in the past two weeks due to students and teachers out with the flu.\nOn the worst day, attendance plummeted to 87%.\nIt's normally at 95% or higher.\n\"In the past 3 months we've seen a significant uptick in the number of flu cases, that vast majority of that has been flu A,” said Clark.\nLocal doctors say they're also seeing the spike.\nAccording to the Waco-McLennan County flu dashboard, as of Wednesday afternoon, there are currently 196 cases of flu A and 16 cases of Flu B.\n\"This year there seems to be a pretty strong strain of Flu A,” said Clark.\nMcGregor ISD says the flu is also significantly impacting teachers, causing them to have to shuffle around to get enough coverage for their classrooms.\nDoctors have this advice for you to help prevent the spread.\n\" Certainly the number one thing to do is just get your flu vaccine. There are a lot of people asking if it's too late to get the flu vaccine, 'should I still get it', the answer is absolutely yes. If you have an older kid try to keep them out of contact with some of the rest of the family or school age friends,” said Clark.\nMcGregor ISD says it's prioritizing cleaning procedures in their classrooms and cafeteria, and reminding students to wash their hands.\nBut the number one piece of advice from local doctors;\n\" If you have kids that are sick, keep them home,” said Clark.\nFollow Madison on social media!",

The meeting was attended by officials from the Greater Noida authority, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), and the forest department, along with environmentalist Vikrant Tongad.Officials said on-site inspection was held recently and the entire team reviewed the sources of pollution affecting the wetland ecological balance, particularly its trees and plants. The inspection revealed that untreated water from Sector Ecotech 3, Police Lines, and nearby industries, was being discharged into the wetland, causing significant harm to the flora.“The Surajpur wetland is a critical ecological zone, and we cannot allow it to suffer from unchecked pollution. Immediate action is essential to protect its biodiversity, and all departments concerned must work swiftly to ensure that necessary steps are taken to prevent further damage,” said Srilakshmi VS.The ACEO directed immediate construction of a 700m long RCC drain to divert the wastewater from Ecotech 3 Sector and Police Lines into an existing drain along DSC Road.Work circle 3 officials of Greater Noida said an estimate has been prepared for constructing the RCC drain and officials concerned have now been instructed to obtain administrative, financial, and technical approvals for the project. As for the discharge of chemical waste from an industrial unit located adjacent to the wetland, Srilakshmi VS has directed the establishment concerned to immediately make alternative arrangements for the disposal of wastewater into the DSC Road drain.“These solutions are expected to be sustainable and provide lasting protection to the wetland,” said Srilakshmi VS.“Necessary instructions have been issued to the officials to take steps on all fronts, including construction of RCC drain for Sector Ecotech 3 and Police Lines. Industrial units have been asked to ensure proper wastewater disposal, and a long-term solution for Surajpur village’s drainage, which is essential to protect the wetland ecosystem, is also under consideration,” said Srilakshmi VS.",

The leaders alleged that 'the martyrs’ soil got defiled by the visit of Pandian to the place who is promoting beef consumption on Odisha Chief Minister’s directions'.\nScores of men and women from Sri Bairagi Sishu Mandir took out a rally and reached the Saheed Padia and sprinkled cow dung and turmeric water on the entire area.\nAlso Read:\nVHP demands investigation as row erupts over Kamiya Jani\n“The way VK Pandian took Kamiya Jani, who consumes and promotes beef, into Puri Srimandir and offered Maha Prasad is not acceptable. It is an attempt to defame Hindu culture. Mahila Morcha and others sprinkled the entire area here with cow dung to purify it. We urge everybody to come forward to save Jagannath culture,” said Bhadrak BJP Mahila Morcha leader, Kalpana Jena.\nResponding to the allegations made by the BJP, BJD leader Harekrushna Padhy said, “This shows the Opposition has become intolerant and is frustrated. The stadium where the meeting was held has been named after martyrs. Those who sprinkled cow dung water need to purify themselves first. The Opposition has nothing to do other than coming up with frivolous allegations and opposing the government.”\nAlso Read:\nIndira Gandhi could not enter Puri Srimandir, but Kamiya Jani could!

    "text": "Avanza la socialización de la Ciudadela de la Salud y ven interés para financiarla\nLa Gobernación de Cochabamba continúa con la socialización del proyecto de la Ciudadela de la Salud, informó ayer el secretario de Planificación de la Gobernación, Guillermo Bazoberry. Comentó que “varios proponentes” expresaron su interés para financiar esta megaobra.\n“Hay varios proponentes interesados, pero corresponde realizar las gestiones ante el Viceministerio de Inversión Pública, toda vez que son ellos los encargados de canalizar los recursos. Estamos expectantes a que se concretice el interés de varios”, explicó.\nTambién informó que se concluyó el informe técnico de condiciones previas y el informe de justificación de conveniencia técnica para una posible adjudicación “llave en mano”. En este sentido, el pasado lunes, el gobernador Humberto Sánchez emitió la Resolución Departamental 076/2024, que viabiliza y posiciona el proyecto en el Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública, mencionó.\nLa obra requiere de una inversión de 600 millones de dólares para la infraestructura y equipamiento, y aproximadamente seis años para su ejecución. Se construirá en el Distrito 3 de Cercado, en una superficie de 185.805,30 metros cuadrados, en el exhipódromo.\nBazoberry indicó que cuenta con el apoyo de la Organización Panamericana de la Salud (OPS). Durante las últimas semanas, la Gobernación socializó el proyecto con diferentes sectores e instituciones, entre ellas, la Brigada Parlamentaria, Trabajadores de la Salud Pública, la Central Obrera (COD) y el Comité Cívico.",

    "title": "Attorney claims graphic ‘evidence’ suggests accused Gilgo Beach serial killer did not live ‘double life’",
    "text": "By Andrea Cavallier ,\n57 minutes ago\nA New York attorney claimed to have new “circumstantial evidence” in the Gilgo Beach murder case that he believes could prove accused serial killer Rex Heuermann was not living a double life.\nJohn Ray, who represents the family of Shannan Gilbert, whose disappearance led to the discovery of the ‘Gilgo Four’ remains, said at a press conference on Thursday that Heuermann’s daughter Victoria , 27, had previously posted to social media disturbing images.\n“This appears to be the remains of a human being that looks half-eaten,” Ray told reporters outside his Long Island office, as he presented images he said were found on her Tumblr blog.\nRay presented his “evidence” exactly a week after Heuermann, 60, was arraigned on murder charges in the 2003 dismemberment death of Jessica Taylor, 20, and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, 28. No members of his family have been charged with crimes in relation to the case.\nHeuermann’s estranged wife Asa Ellerup and the couple’s two children were out of state at the time of the hearing, according to their attorney, Robert Macedonio. They still live in the Massapequa Park home, which has been searched twice.\nEllerup has previously claimed to know nothing about the suspected serial killer’s “double life.”\nHeuermann’s adult children, Victoria Heuermann and Christopher Sheridan, have been “caught in the cross hairs of this deeply unfortunate case that they have nothing to do with other than they are related to Mr. Heuermann,” their attorney Vess Mitev has previously said.\nThe Manhattan architect has already been charged with the 2009 and 2010 murders of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes — known as the “Gilgo Four.” He pleaded not guilty in all five murders.\nRay claimed the photos they allegedly found on Heuermann’s daughter’s social media accounts show that Victoria was “brought up in this sickness.”\n”The evidence that we have suggests that we have been sold a story by the Heuermann family,” he said, without offering anything to back up his wild assertions beyond photos.\nRay showed several gruesome images to the press on Thursday from Victoria’s alleged account that he says show a “strange familiarity” to Heuermann’s alleged victims, including Jessica Taylor, whose torso was found in a wooded area of manorville in July 2003. Her skull, hands and forearm, were found on Gilgo Beach in 2011. Another image appears to show remains that are “half eaten,” Ray claimed.\nLawyer Misty Marris told “NewsNation Now” the “circumstantial evidence” proves nothing.\n“To implicate the family at this point, without evidence, without the task force or prosecutors making that link, it just seems incredibly premature,” Marris said.\nLast month, Gilgo Beach Task Force investigators completed a second search of Heuermann’s home in Massapequa Park and a search of an area of Manorville.\nSuffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney revealed that Heuermann kept a “blueprint” of his crimes on a hard drive in his basement of his Massapequa Park home which was recently searched for a second time.\nTierney said Gilgo Beach Task Force believes “this planning document that was used by Heuermann to plot out his kills with excruciating detail.”\n“His motivations, meticulous planning, and clear intent were obvious,” Tierney told reporters following the arraignment. “His intent was nothing short but to murder these victims.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
