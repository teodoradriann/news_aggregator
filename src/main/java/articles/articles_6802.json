    "text": "Peak boating season 'down under' is now in full swing. Get your boat in top condition with the WEST SYSTEM range of epoxy products which suit all kinds of vessels and maintenance projects involving aluminium, fibreglass, reinforcing fabrics, plastic, wood or composites.\nDeveloped specifically for the marine industry, WEST SYSTEM is an industry standard and is used around the world by amateur and professional boat builders for boat construction and boat repairs.\nATL Composites has been manufacturing WEST SYSTEM® epoxy products in New Zealand and Australia, under licence to Gougeon Brothers Inc, USA, since 1977.\nApart from damage and wear and tear, boats also suffer from age-related problems such as fatigue and moisture, and although many of these problems can be intimidating, with correct techniques and materials they are not difficult to solve. westsystem.com.au/detailed-repairs\nFibreglass Boat Repair and Maintenance - To effectively repair damage typical of fibreglass boats, the repair material must be a superior structural adhesive, capable of bonding not only to polyester resin, but also to glass fibre, wood, metal and other materials.\nGelcoat Blister Repair - Repairing the blister with epoxy and then coating the hull with an epoxy barrier coat is presently the most dependable solution and prevention for this problem\nWooden Boat Repair - For successful for surface preparation, bonding, laminating, fairing, applying reinforcements and final coating and finishing.\nAluminium Boat Repair - Used to repair the most common problems - Leaking Seams & Rivets -Patching Holes in Aluminium Hulls - Repairing Pitted & Pin-holed Surfaces.\nRecently completed after three years of meticulous restoration works, three iconic Halvorsen timber motor yachts were returned to the water.\nRelying on WEST SYSTEM products to bring them back to their former glory, shipwright Russell Salisbury, owner of Russell Marine Maintenance based at The Boat Works in Queensland said \"I have been using WEST SYSTEM epoxies since the beginning when I did my apprenticeship at Doornbos boat builders, then establishing Russell Marine at the Boat Works in 2008 and to the present.\n\"I like the overall reliability of the product. Whether it be a resin-based sheathing project, resin infused with adhesive powder to make a strong gluing compound, or the resin again infused with microballoons or fairing powder to make a beautiful filling compound, it was faultless from a mixing perspective because of the clever inclusion of the measured pump packs.\"\nWEST SYSTEM products are available through leading chandleries nationwide westsystem.com.au/dealers\nDetailed repair information can be downloaded for FREE here.\nAnd if you want to discuss your specific application, the ATL Composites' Technical Team is always available and happy to provide advice on (07) 5563 1222.\nQuick Links:",

    "title": "'Team Member Posted Incorrect Translation': Assam CM on 'Shudras to Serve Other Castes' Tweet",
    "text": "New Delhi: On December 28, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma apologised for his social media post on caste two days ago, saying it was an “incorrect translation”.\nThe CM took to X, formerly Twitter, to issue the apology and claimed that a team member had posted the erroneous translation of a sloka from the Bhagavad Gita .\nIn his apology, he claimed that Assam was “casteless”.\n‘Shudras to serve other castes’\nOn December 26, the CM’s X handle made a post claiming that “Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas”.\nThe Shudras, Brahmins, Khastriyas and Vaishyas are castes mentioned in the Hindu varna or caste system that assigns a hierarchy to people born into these communities. Shudras belong to the “lowest” caste, as per the varna system.\nPer a report by Deccan Herald , Sarma’s post also included an animated video that stated that “farming, cow-rearing and commerce are habitual and natural duties of the Vaishya, while serving the three ‘varnas’ – Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaishya – is the natural duty of the Shudras”.\nSarma even said in the post that “God Sri Krishna himself described the types of natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras”, per the DH report.\nThe post sparked outrage on the social platform, and from opposition parties. The CPI (M) said that they “strongly denounce Assam CM Himanta Biswas’ tweet” and that it was “BJPs Manuvadi ideology in full play”.\n“Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It’s reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam’s Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,” tweeted Asaduddin Owaisi, President of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and an MP from Hyderabad.\nSarma’s tweet was later deleted.\n“I sincerely apologize”\nIn a post on X on December 28, Sarma said that he routinely uploads one sloka from the Bhagavad Gita every morning on his social media handles. He has so far posted 668 slokas, he said.\nHowever, he put the blame on a “team member” for an “incorrect translation” of a sloka on caste – claiming that “Shudras” are to “serve” the higher castes – from the Bhagavad Gita.\n“Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post,” Sarma tweeted.\nHe added that Assam “reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva”.\n“If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” he added.\nhttps://x.com/himantabiswa/status/1740387789361803379?s=20 >\nMake a contribution to Independent Journalism",
