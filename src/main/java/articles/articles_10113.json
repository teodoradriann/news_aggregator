    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "A large group of freshmen led by Cayden Lancelin and Shadon Lee have the Westgate High boys basketball team on a hot streak.\nLancelin and Lee combined to score 43 points as the Tigers knocked off another young talented local squad, Lafayette Renaissance, in the opening round of the St. Thomas More Sunkist Shootout on Thursday.\nIt was the fourth win in five games since Dec. 20 for the Tigers, who erased a double-digit deficit for the 68-58 victory.\nWestgate (5-3) beat Iowa, which reached the 2023-24 Division II nonselect state tourney, on its home court last weekend, and blew out Division V select runner-up J.S. Clark by 17 points on Monday.\n\"We've had some really good wins,\" said Westgate oach Oliver Winston, whose team will face the St. Thomas More/Patterson winner at 6 p.m. Friday in the second round.\n\"It's really important when you're young like that, to get some success against a tough schedule. We've had a couple of games where we got blown out by teams with older guys.\"\nWestgate, which has lost to Lafayette High (9-0), Sulphur (11-2) and H.L. Bourgeois. fell behind LRCA 12-2 in the first quarter as coach Brad Boyd's Tigers made their first five field goals.\n\"It was a little bit of youth and me not doing a good job of making sure we're tuned in at the beginning of a game,\" Winston said of the slow start. \"I thought we did a good job once we started making some adjustments and turning up the tempo of the game.\"\nLRCA (7-3) was led by Matthew Gordon (17 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, three steals), Bubba Etienne (14 pts, 4 rebs, 3 steals) and Tavion Gallien (9 pts, four assists).\nThere were seven lead changes during the game, which was tied seven times. Antonio Quetel, one of 10 Westgate freshmen, put the Tigers ahead 53-52 with 5:15 remaining.\nQuetel (7 points, 5 rebs, 3 assists) added a jumper from the baseline a few seconds later after a steal by Lancelin, whose 3-pointer made it 59-56 with 2:13 to go.\n\"Cayden really kept us in the game in the first half offensively,\" Winston said of the freshman, who made 5 of his first 6 field goals and finished just shy of a triple-double with nine rebounds and eight steals (five assists). \"It's good to have a kid who can do that.\n\"In the second half, we had other guys step up and help him. Lee does a good job defensively. He's all over the ball, attacking the rim and making shots. He's an overall scorer.\"\nLee finished with five rebounds and four steals. Freshman forward Chance Archangel (7 pts, 8 rebs) and senior forward Peyton Knatt were able to stay in the game despite foul trouble. The two big-bodies were a force inside.\nArchangel, who picked up his fourth foul in the third quarter, asserted himself in the lane with two buckets in the closing minutes.\n\"I thought we did a good job of hustling, taking charges and getting steals,\" Winston said. \"Once we sped up the game, it's a little better style for us.\"\nFour players fouled out and another nine finished the game with either 3-or-4 fouls.\n\"We're carrying 14 players,\" Winston said. \"We're going to play 12. We'll play 14 if we have to. If you're sitting on the bench, you have to be able to play.\"",

    "title": "Beth Kowitt: Corporate America should amp up the volume on DEI – Twin Cities",
    "text": "After the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, corporate America undertook a collective virtue signaling. Many of the companies that were already making efforts to improve diversity, equity and inclusion rushed to promote it, and those that weren’t quickly launched initiatives — a signal that they, too, were doing their part to fight racial inequality.\nNearly four years later, an almost complete reversal has taken place. Nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies now have a chief inclusion and diversity officer, and about half of the S&P 100 have publicly stated diversity goals. But good luck getting them to talk about it.\nBusinesses have plenty of reasons to keep quiet. The Supreme Court’s June decision reversing affirmative action at colleges and universities has had a chilling effect, with companies closely monitoring how the ruling could open them up to legal action for their own hiring practices. A cohort of Republican politicians — led by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and his attacks on Walt Disney Co. — have decided to make their war on “woke capitalism” central to their platform. On the proxy front, investors are filing shareholder proposals meant to undermine companies’ diversity efforts. Activist investor Bill Ackman’s successful campaign to oust Harvard University President Claudine Gay and his attacks on the university’s DEI practices have many expecting he’ll turn his attention to corporate America next. Elon Musk, who can never seem to stay away from the party, has also chimed in, sending out a barrage of tweets attacking DEI.\nAmid the heightened scrutiny and blowback from the right, some companies have indeed retreated from their DEI investments. Chief diversity officers, for example, have been targeted in the latest round of corporate layoffs. But the numbers so far indicate that most companies, to their credit, seem to be sticking by their DEI programs. A recent report from labor and employment law firm Littler found that the majority of the companies represented in its survey expanded their DEI initiatives over the past year despite saying that the backlash had increased since the Supreme Court’s decision.\nBut the inclination among corporate America to advertise its DEI work has evaporated as legal departments, law firms and communications teams advise companies to say less. As Fortune has reported, not a single session this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, includes the acronyms DEI or ESG (environmental, social and governance efforts have also become a target of the so-called anti-woke mob). Mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion on earnings calls and at conferences has fallen drastically, according to a Bloomberg News analysis; in the third quarter of 2023, the acronym’s use fell to its lowest level since 2018.\nThose who are still talking about DEI have found a workaround by just calling it something else. A September survey of executives working in corporate responsibility reported that 60% have changed the language they use to talk about the work. Words like “belonging” and “responsibility” are replacing the now controversial three-letter acronym. Consider Walmart, which, in what it calls “an evolution of the role,” now has a chief belonging officer rather than a chief diversity officer.\nThe impulse here is understandable. Why make yourself a target if you don’t have to? Isn’t all that matters that the work gets done? In fact, I’ve argued here before that less grandstanding and more substantive action is never a bad thing.\nAnd yet this is case where words do matter. Refusing to talk about DEI or renaming it altogether comes across like an admission of guilt, that what a company is doing is wrong and needs to happen quietly in the shadows. It provides more fodder for and fails to counter those opposed to DEI, who have been perpetuating a false narrative about what it means, either out of a base misunderstanding or to intentionally obfuscate.\nBut companies remain committed to their DEI efforts because they work — they help attract and retain talent, they help get the most out of employees, they create a workforce that reflects the population that companies serve. Corporate America needs to say that, and yet the collective virtue signaling has been replaced by a collective clamming up.\nOne of the few prominent voices advocating for DEI right now is Mark Cuban, who posted a thoughtful thread on X in the aftermath of Gay’s departure from Harvard. In doing so, he’s made himself a target of the vocal anti-DEI contingent. But rather than back away, he’s continued to forcefully engage with his critics, just as Ackman and Musk have done. Corporate America should take notice. This might be one of those rare occasions where talking is as important as doing.\nBeth Kowitt is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering corporate America.

    "title": "A filthy secular humanist watches three 'War on Christmas' classics—so you don't have to",
    "text": "The War on Christmas season is one of my favorite times of the year. But as a semi-devoted agnostic who loves all the trappings of the holidays—the carols, the lights, the kringles, relatives getting pummeled with beautiful snow drifts in the idyllic Midwestern towns where I used to live—my loyalties tend to be torn. I love the idea of wiping the wide-eyed wonder off millions of yawping kids’ faces, but I also love fudge squares with sprinkles. So do I come to bury Christmas or to praise it? Well, how about a rapprochement of sorts? In a bid to end the hostilities once and for all, I’ve decided to meet the enemy on its own turf. It’s kind of like that time Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the DMZ—though with marginally better haircuts. And fewer Christmas hams, ironically. As my Christmas and/or holiday and/or solstice gift to you all, I decided to sit down and watch three “classic” War on Christmas movies so you don’t have to. It was the War on Christmas equivalent of storming the beaches of Normandy. I deserve a nice burial plot somewhere special after this is all over. The three movies I picked are “Christmas with a Capital C,” “Last Ounce of Courage,” and “Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas.” They did not disappoint—unless you mean in the conventional sense of failing to inform, entertain, or enlighten. Then they did disappoint. Very much so. So let’s get started, shall we? Our first film on the docket is ... This 2010 offering is a bit like your typical Hallmark Channel Christmas movie, but with 100% more Ted McGinley. If you’re craving a feature-length film premised on the notion that every American has an inalienable right to continually badger people who don’t celebrate the same holidays they do, then this is the Christmas film for you. And if you loved the scene in “A Christmas Story” where that kid got his tongue stuck to a frozen flagpole, you’re in luck—because sitting through this movie feels exactly like that. A filthy secular humanist lawyer named Mitch Bright—played by one of the lesser Baldwins, though not the one who played Barney Rubble—returns to his bucolic Alaskan hometown after 20 years to discover Christmas shit everywhere. He doesn’t like it because, as noted, he’s a filthy secular humanist, and atheism has made him grumpy. So he tries to get the town nativity scene removed from public land. Meanwhile, Mitch’s old high school rival, Mayor Dan Reed (McGinley), really loves Christmas and wonders what happened to Mitch to make him so unreasonable about using tax dollars to elevate one particular faith above all others. Of course, while Dan is fairly politic in his dealings with Mitch and the rest of the town’s Christmas haters, his brother Greg (played by Christian comedian Brad Stine) is up in everyone’s face about it. At one point a coffee shop employee wishes Greg “happy holidays,” and with the way he reacts, you’d think she’d written “Hail Satan” in his latte foam. Throughout his subsequent “comic” tirade, Greg makes it abundantly clear that Christmas is the only winter holiday worth celebrating—but thanks for playing, dirty infidels. In other words, this is a movie about cultural supremacy. Mainline Christianity is what December is all about, not any of these other so-called “beliefs.” By the way, the movie—and especially Greg’s coffee shop freakout—is based on the song of the same name by Go Fish. You can watch that masterpiece here: “Christmas with a Capital C” is available for free on Tubi. My War on Christmas rating: three candy-cane shivs. Before you’re finished with this one, you’ll dimly wonder why it wasn’t called “Last Ounce of Patience.” Bob Revere, another small-town mayor, finds himself in a struggle with a secular humanist outsider for the soul of his town, which has been irretrievably sullied by modern conceptions of fairness. Bob wants Christmas stuff displayed everywhere, not just in or in front of people’s private homes. Political correctness is everywhere! The local school is putting on a winter pageant with a story about aliens instead of angels; we hear on the radio that the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has stopped sponsoring its local Christmas parade; and we see a clip of former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who’s so incensed about the serial depredations against Christmas that he’s bravely saying so to his almost exclusively right-wing Christian audience. Years earlier, Bob’s son died fighting overseas, and when Bob’s grandson asks him what Bob is doing to make the world safe for excessive, often-gaudy monthlong celebrations focused almost entirely on conspicuous consumption, Bob has an epiphany. He’s going to save Christmas, no matter the sacrifice. Here’s an actual Bob quote from the film: “Christmas is for everyone. If you’re a Muslim [and] you want to pray to Allah in the middle of the town square, by all means, please. It’s one of your rights. If you’re Jewish [and] you want to display your menorah and blow your shofar, go ahead, and accept my admiration for standing up for what you believe in. But don’t tell me and the majority of us that believe in Jesus Christ that we don’t have the right to celebrate the day of his birth, because it’s Christmas.” And here’s another: “We’re not losing some endangered species of fish. Our freedoms are being taken away from us one by one. Now that’s how we’re taking them back—one at a time. We’re gonna start with Christmas. Now, if I want to put up a nativity scene on my front yard, I’m gonna do it. If I want to put a Christmas tree on the courthouse lawn, like we used to, then we’re gonna do it.” Yeah, those two things—putting a nativity scene in one’s front yard and putting a Christmas tree on the courthouse lawn—aren’t remotely the same thing. The first is clearly fine, and something everyone should have an unquestioned right to do. In fact, we should all be willing to fight to preserve that right, regardless of our religious beliefs. The second is problematic only if it’s specifically intended to highlight the doctrines of a particular religion. So it’s interesting he didn’t use “put a nativity scene on the courthouse lawn” as his example. Maybe because most fair-minded people would have a problem with a local government favoring one set of beliefs over all others. But without straw men—both to push down and, presumably, to direct the movie—this film wouldn’t exist, would it? Near the end of the film, in a brave show of … something, Mayor Bob—who rides around town on a motorcycle flying an American flag the size of an infield tarp—hoists a “Jesus Saves” sign onto the side of the local mission in defiance of … something. It’s unclear if it’s an explicitly Christian mission. If so, no one in this universe (even a filthy secular humanist) would ever try to keep him from putting a cross on it. If it’s city-owned, well, maybe find an alternate spot for that big sign. Might I suggest a church? After all, the solutions to these “problems” are really, really simple when you think about it. “Last Ounce of Courage” is available on YouTube, so you can watch it here for free! Go ahead. I dare you. My War on Christmas rating: two spicy-nog-filled balloon grenades. It’s still unclear whether the title indicates Kirk Cameron is saving Christmas, or if “Saving Christmas” is the name of the movie and the movie is his. What is clear is that it received a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Which presumably means even fundie Christian critics hated it. And it’s pretty easy to see why. This is a movie for prosperity-gospel preachers, and the theology it’s predicated on appears to spring exclusively from the mind of Cameron, the Martin Goofer of a new, presumably very lucrative reformation. If you want a taste of his mind—be warned, there’s not quite enough of it to cover an oyster cracker—you should watch this Kirk Cameron Crocoduck video before you proceed. It’s truly something. RELATED STORY: While U.S. church attendance has dropped, prosperity gospel has risen—with a brutal take on poverty In “Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas,” Kirk manages to save Christmas for his brother-in-law, who’s bemoaning the commercialization of the holiday much as Charlie Brown did in “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” Except Cameron’s movie is far less respectful of Christian traditions than the cartoon was. As Kirk’s B-I-L points out all the ways the secular world has encroached on the true meaning of Christmas—with pagan and popular innovations like the Christmas tree, Santa Claus, and commercialism all eclipsing Jesus—Kirk smugly looks on before explaining all that “commercial” stuff is actually biblical! No, really. And he can prove it. For instance, when Kirk’s B-I-L notes that the Christmas tree was originally a pagan symbol that had nothing to do with Christianity, Kirk lets him know this is all wrong because the trees God made in Genesis are just like Christmas trees: “When God created the world, he filled it with trees. He hung fruit on the trees. When it was time for him to build his house and make it beautiful, he brought trees inside,” Kirk says, bursting with theological brio. “And guess what he placed on the branches of the tree in his house? Lights. Beautiful green trees decorated with fruit, shimmering with lights, inside a house. That’s God’s idea, not the Druids’.” And don’t worry about those gleaming boxes of “Grand Theft Auto” games and hard liquor lying underneath the tree. They’re not a bastardization of a sacrosanct holiday; they’re part of God’s plan! You see, those presents piled haphazardly under the tree look like a city skyline! And what city might that be? Only the best one ever! “Imagine the new Jerusalem, a heavenly city whose builder and architect is God,” Kirk says. “And what’s at the center of that city? A tree. The Tree of Life.” Following a hip-hop version of “Angels We Have Heard on High,” complete with an auto-tuned “in excelsis Deo,” Kirk delivers the coup de gross: “Don’t buy into the complaint about materialism during Christmas. Sure, don’t max out your credit cards or use presents to buy friends. But remember, this is a celebration of the eternal God taking on a material body, so it’s right that our holiday is marked with material things.” In other words, the true meaning of Christmas is having lots of toys and ham. And the god of the Israelites totally approves. Of course, I considered the possibility that this movie was originally produced by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and that they eventually decided it was too gauche to use, prompting Cameron to slap his own name on it and release it as new content. But then I doubt Cameron is that savvy—or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that tasteless and greedy. “Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas” is available on Hulu and Prime Video. I don’t have any fun clips of this one or, God forbid, the whole movie, but here’s a Crocoduck for ya. My War on Christmas rating: one giant spoiled ham and his brother-in-law. Check out Aldous J.

    "title": "Un matemático explica por qué es absurdo circular a más de 120 Km/h por la autovía",
    "text": "Conducir a alta velocidad es una práctica común entre muchos conductores que buscan llegar a su destino en el menor tiempo posible. Las razones pueden variar, ya sea para evitar atascos , cumplir con compromisos laborales o personales, o simplemente la prisa de llegar a casa a descansar. Sin embargo, más allá de los riesgos evidentes para tu seguridad y la de tus ocupantes, conducir a una velocidad superior al límite legal de 120 km/h en autopistas puede que no tenga mucho sentido. Un matemático, José Ángel Murcia , ha explicado de manera clara por qué es inútil pisar el acelerador cuando vas en la carretera. En un vídeo viral, el experto desglosa la relación entre velocidad y tiempo , demostrando que aumentar la velocidad no resulta en un ahorro significativo de tiempo . Para entender el argumento de Murcia, es fundamental comprender la relación inversamente proporcional entre la velocidad y el tiempo. A primera vista, puede parecer que aumentar la velocidad siempre reduce significativamente el tiempo de viaje, pero esto no es del todo cierto. Aunque pueda parecer que conducir a máxima velocidad es lo correcto, el ahorro es mínimo. Al subir de 120 km/h a 140 km/h, el tiempo que se necesita para recorrer un kilómetro solo disminuye en 4,3 segundos. Aquí está el desglose de cómo se reduce el tiempo a medida que aumentas la velocidad: La conclusión es clara, ya que a partir de ciertas velocidades, cada incremento adicional en la velocidad produce una reducción cada vez menor en el tiempo de viaje, y esto también aplica si subes hasta los 160 km/h, porque ahorrarías solo 3,2 segundos, lo cual no tiene ningún sentido. Todo esto demuestra que conducir a un ritmo excesivo no solo pone en peligro tu vida y la de los demás, sino que, como demuestra el matemático, el ahorro de tiempo es absurdo. ¿Vale la pena arriesgarse por unos pocos segundos? La próxima vez que consideres pisar el acelerador para llegar más rápido a tu destino, recuerda que esta acción no compensa los riesgos involucrados . Conducir de manera responsable es la mejor forma de garantizar la seguridad de todos en la autopista. Conoce cómo trabajamos en ComputerHoy.",

    "title": "Rajasthan farmers rejoice at cold weather, say it's a boon for rabi crops",
    "text": "Rajasthan has been reeling under a severe cold wave, which has brought joy to the state’s farmers who believe the cold weather will only add to a better harvest of Rabi crops.\nCommodity traders also feel that the production of Rabi crops will increase due to severe cold conditions.\n“If along with the cold, there are one or two spells of rain in the coming week or so, it will certainly help increase crop production in the state,” said Ajju Meena, a farmer in the Shivdaspura area near Jaipur.\nWheat and barley trader KG Jhalani of Kukarkheda grain market in Jaipur says due to the ongoing cold wave, the production of wheat and barley is expected to improve slightly. “During severe cold, there is more dew which increases moisture in the ground, providing additional water to the crops, which helps in thickening the grains of wheat and barley,” Jhalani said.\nMustard trader Anil Chatar of Chandpole grain market in Jaipur said that the mustard crop will benefit due to the cold. He said the production is expected to increase by 3 to 4 per cent. “If this cold continues for the next 10-12 days and if there’s rain, then the production of mustard in the state can be good,” he said. Rajasthan is the largest producer of mustard.\nGram trader Shyam Natani said the cold should benefit gram, wheat, barley, mustard and cumin.\nThe sowing of crops reduced slightly this time due to the lack of monsoon rain. If it rains once or twice this winter season, the production of crops will be better, despite less sowing, Natani said, adding that farmers have to keep a watch on frost as it can damage the crops.\nAn agriculture department official said the frost can damage tomatoes, potatoes, chillis, brinjals, papayas, peas, gram, coriander, and fennel.\nAccording to the agriculture department, in the current Rabi crop season till January 1, against a target of 3,100,000 hectares, wheat was sown in 91.98 per cent of the area, barley in 457,726 hectares, which is 125 per cent above the target fixed for 2023-24, gram in 1,938,881 hectares, around 92 per cent of the target, mustard in 3,621,249 hectares against a target area of 4,100,000.

    "text": "Centurion: At the end of their innings on Wednesday, India had scraped together 32 fours and five sixes en route 245 runs at a run rate of 3.62 runs per over.\nA large chunk of that - boundaries and the resultant spike in run rate - was because of KL Rahul and his counterattacking 137-ball 101.\nAt the end of their innings on Thursday, South Africa had belted 55 fours and four sixes to get to 408 all out in 108.4 overs at a run rate of 3.75.\nThat difference in run rate between the sides might not seem significant, but the number of boundaries conceded offers a view of how poor India’s bowlers were in those sessions.\nIndia gave away 244 runs in boundaries, meaning only 164 runs came from running between wickets and in the form of extras.\nOf course, this meant South Africa’s batters tackled the conditions well, especially Dean Elgar and Marco Jansen. But to turn a blind eye to how mediocre India were with the ball would be dishonest.\nFor the last few years, India’s bowling has seldom painted such a poor picture. Their indiscipline in the hours spent bowling at the South Africans was so pronounced that Rohit Sharma’s normally expressive face did nothing more than stare in blank confusion. He didn’t even have it in him to yell at his bowlers after a point.\nKL Rahul, as it turned out, donned those duties, having a go at anyone who didn’t look like they wanted to be out there.\nSince taking over as captain, Rohit has rarely seen such a pedestrian performance from his bowling unit so it must have come as a shock.\nIt must have also made him want Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja back.\nShami was ruled out of the series due to an ankle injury, and Jadeja was pulled out of the opening Test due to back spasms.\nSo, India came into this Test with Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Shardul Thakur and R Ashwin.\nA recovering Bumrah last played a Test in July 2022. Siraj, Shardul and Ashwin last played a Test in July 2023. Prasidh has never played Test cricket.\nAll of this rustiness and inexperience was abundantly evident in the overs they struggled to get through. This despite there being plenty to exploit off the pitch and from the heavy overhead conditions. Even on Thursday, though there was plenty of sun, there was enough juice in the pitch.\nBumrah was, by far, the best of the lot. He too was guilty of straying it into the pads from time to time, but for the most part, he was on target. At least he kept the slip cordon alert as and when he came on for his spells.\nWhile Siraj wasn’t too bad either, he didn’t find the right lengths to attack. In fact, he barely bowled a short ball when the batters were still getting their eye in. When he did, he wasn’t directing them well.\nShardul was too full, and Prasidh was unable to overcome the anxiety of playing his maiden Test. The duo began sprightly but were reduced to a trundling mess by the end of it, unable to get past their early failures to focus on the sessions to follow.\nMeanwhile, Ashwin was tidy but hardly someone to fear. Actually, save for Bumrah - and even that only sporadically - the South Africans had nothing or no one to fear. It showed.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 21:18 IST)",

    "text": "CAN 2024 : les Lions sénégalais font chuter les Indomptables camerounais (3-1)\nTrès efficaces, les Lions de la Teranga ont pris leur revanche sur la sélection nationale camerounaise. Largement en tête du groupe C (6 points), ils filent vers les huitièmes de finale. C’est Sadio Mané en personne qui est venu à la 95e minute asséner le coup final.\nPublié le 19 janvier 2024 Lecture : 2 minutes.\nLe Sénégal a enfin battu le Cameroun (3-1) en Coupe d’Afrique des nations, trente-quatre ans après, pour se qualifier pour les huitième de finale, débarrassé de son vieux complexe face à son prestigieux adversaire, nettement dominé vendredi 19 janvier à Yamoussoukro.\nL’histoire a basculé. L’ouverture du score du Marseillais\nIsmaïla Sarr, qui a pu se retourner dans une défense apathique (16e), symbolise ces courbes en train de se croiser entre les deux vieux rivaux. Au Sénégal le réalisme, au Cameroun le manque de hargne.\nLe tenant du titre assume toujours bien son rôle de favori :\nil rejoint en huitièmes le Cap-Vert, qualifié un peu plus tôt en cartonnant le Mozambique (3-0) avec notamment un coup franc de 40 mètres de Bebé. Le Cameroun, tenu en échec par la Guinée (1-1) au premier match, est encore loin du deuxième tour et de son glorieux passé.\nUne revanche historique\nÀ part un premier match de groupe gagné (2-0) en Algérie en 1990, les Lions de la Teranga avaient toujours fini en larmes face aux Indomptables du Cameroun. Battus chez eux à Dakar en quarts de finale en 1992 (1-0), en finale 2002 (0-0, 3-2 aux t.a.b.) et encore en quarts en 2017 (0-0, 5-4 aux t.a.b.), quand\n Sadio Mané avait raté son tir au but, les Sénégalais ont cette fois fait la loi, à l’image de leur capitaine Kalidou Koulibaly, solide comme un roc, vainqueur de nombreux duels avec les attaquants camerounais.\nÀ voir Lamine Camara demander à grands moulinets encore plus de bruits aux supporters sénégalais, on comprenait que le prometteur (20 ans) milieu de terrain, auteur d’un doublé au premier match contre la Gambie (3-0), vivait intensément la rivalité entre les deux Lions (16).\nAprès les joutes verbales entre les sélectionneurs sénégalais Aliou Cissé et camerounais Rigobert Song, qui étaient tous les deux capitaines de la finale 2002, la plus belle affiche du premier tour n’a pas tenu ses promesses, faute de consistance des joueurs en vert. Franck Magri, replacé du côté droit à son vrai poste, avant-centre, n’a eu que des miettes. Et le gardien André Onana, autorisé à n’arriver que pour le second match, n’a rien pu faire.\nLe spectacle n’a été vraiment intense que vers la fin, dans un stade Konan-Banny plein, achevé de se remplir à la mi-temps par l’ouverture des portes aux spectateurs massés derrière les grilles. Après le 2-0 signé Habib Diallo, reprenant un centre de Sarr (71), les Camerounais ont enfin réagi avec un but de la tête de Jean-Charles Castelletto (83).\nLes Sénégalais ont alors testé leur « complexe camerounais » : ils n’allaient quand même pas se faire rejoindre par une équipe qu’ils avaient dominée!\nTest réussi : après une ultime frayeur sur une tête de Georges-Kevin Nkoudou (90+4), Mané a marqué le but du 3-1 (90+5). Les Lions du Sénégal ne remâcheront plus leur vieille revanche, ils l’ont prise.\n(Avec AFP)\nLa Matinale.\nChaque matin, recevez les 10 informations clés de l’actualité africaine.\nConsultez notre politique de gestion des données personnelles\nLes plus lus\n-\n« Gauthier Pasquet », Bassolé, Benalla et l’improbable projet de déstabilisation d’Ibrahim Traoré\n-\nAffaire du « Pablo Escobar du Sahara » : ce dont « le Malien » accuse Saïd Naciri\n-\nEn RDC, Martin Fayulu a-t-il tout perdu ?\n-\nLa nouvelle vie de l’ex-ministre guinéen Tibou Kamara à Abidjan\n-\n« Gauthier Pasquet » : du soutien à Soro à la lutte contre les juntes, itinéraire d’un cyberactiviste ivoirien",
