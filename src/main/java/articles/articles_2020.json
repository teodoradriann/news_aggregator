    "title": "Wood-burning ban in Southland extended again",
    "text": "A ban on indoor and outdoor wood burning in much of the Southland has been extended through Friday due to a forecast of high air pollution in the area, air quality regulators said. The residential wood-burning ban, which began on Christmas Day , will be in effect until at least 11:59 p.m. Friday for all those in the South Coast Air Basin, including the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and all of Orange County. The order does not apply to mountain communities above 3,000 feet, the Coachella Valley or the high desert, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Homes that rely on wood as a sole source of heat, low-income households and those without natural gas service also are exempt from the requirement. Residents in the affected areas are reminded that burning wood in their fireplaces or any indoor or outdoor wood-burning device is prohibited, as is burning manufactured fire logs, such as those made from wax or paper. Fine particles in wood smoke, also known as particulate matter or PM2.5, can get deep into the lungs and cause respiratory problems such as asthma. Residents can receive no-burn day notifications by signing up for Air Alerts via email or text at www.AirAlerts.org .",

    "text": "Against the vivid blues of a sunny day and the bright greens of the rolling golf course, Colorado Christian University’s Men’s Golf Team posed for pictures with their school’s first ever national championship trophy. Having just clinched the NCAA Division II Championship and their conference’s first ever title—the players reflected on what this historic win meant in light of their Christian faith. Earlier in the semester the golf team studied through the book of Ecclesiastes, which encouraged the players that no matter if they won or lost on the course their identity was firmly rooted in Christ. “No matter how we play we know that we’re loved by Christ,” said Dylan Arthur, the first-finishing senior. “None of this will fulfill us. The wins feel incredible, but at the end of the day, like Ecclesiastes says, it’s all vanity and doesn’t really matter.” \"We all love golf, but that’s not the end for us,” said Xavier Bighause, a CCU junior on the team. “We know that it doesn’t mean much if we can’t glorify the Lord doing it.” Bighause literally carried scripture with him throughout the Cougars’ winning season. He attached Joshua 1:9, which reads, “Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged for the Lord your God will be with you,” to his golf bag. He said this verse allowed him “to go out and play freely, knowing that the result is not who I am as a person.” Arthur also found strength in his faith especially during a critical moment in a tournament in New Mexico where he secured his first win of the season. \"I would pray, ‘God calm my nerves, allow me to know I am doing this for your glory and not my own,’” said Arthur. While the team celebrated their win on the course, their winning perspective on their true success as Christian men is a testament to their faith, the CCU community and their unwavering commitment to glorifying God through the sport they loved.",

    "text": "By John McGary ,\n1 hour ago\nElliott County firefighter Frank Whitt died Tuesday in a single-vehicle accident on the way to visit the funeral home where Elliott EMT Drake Adams, who died earlier in the day, had been taken. (Elliott County EMS) Elliott County lost two first responders on Tuesday. First, emergency medical technician Drake Adams died. Then, on his way to visit the funeral home where Adams’ body was taken, firefighter Frank Whitt died in a single-vehicle accident. Nancy Kuehner is the chief of Volunteer 504 Fire Department, where Whitt had worked since 2016.\n“Our department is doing okay. But I can tell you, for me, it's particularly hard because Frank was a great friend, as he is to most everybody. But he would come to my house to visit once a week. And when I sit on the couch and look at the chair that he always sat in all I can think of as he's not going to sit there anymore.”\nKuehner said Whitt was a great firefighter who was always ready to respond to a call – no matter the time of day or night. She said he spent his last day of his life on the job.\n“He came to take our Engine One to get the tire repaired, because we had damaged it at a fire a few days before. And then after that, he took all the trucks that had been at that previous fire to get fueled up. So he was running the trucks back and forth all day long.”\nKuehner said a little girl who’d known Whitt all her life and was lovingly teased by him said, “I don't have anybody to pull my hair anymore.”\n** WEKU is working hard to be a leading source for public service, and fact-based journalism.

    "text": "DIFE Student of the Year Awards recognise path of graduates\nThis year the Drogheda Institute of Further Education (DIFE) Student of the Year Awards ceremony took place on Friday, November 29.\nThis prestigious ceremony celebrates the contributions and extraordinary paths of graduates, through the presentation of a Student of the Year award to a selection of outstanding students from the 2024 cohort.\nThe event was attended by a host of local dignitaries from the world of education, industry and politics. Over 45 learners were awarded in this year’s ceremony with certificates and trophies presented by the Mayor of Drogheda, Paddy McQuillan to the graduates from a variety of courses.\nThe keynote speakers at the event, were Dáire Keogh, President, Dublin City University and Martin O’Brien, CE of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB) who paid tribute to the fantastic success of the graduates and their achievements in their studies in DIFE.\nThe awards ceremony also saw twelve graduates of the Data Centre Technician Programme in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) included in the ceremony for the conferring of their academic programme. These awards were introduced by Joanne Reynolds, (AWS) with John Kelly (AWS) presenting the overall award for the AWS Student of the Year. This was a momentous occasion with both representatives from DIFE and AWS acknowledging the remarkable success and incredible achievements of learners throughout the programme.\nJoanne Reynolds, Community Engagement Manager, said: “We are thrilled to see the third cohort of learners graduating from this programme, which exemplifies what’s possible when industry and academia join forces. Many of the students are career changers returning to education and have successfully combined studies with their busy lives. We are immensely proud of their dedication, work ethic during internships, and success in forging new careers. We are also grateful to DIFE for their collaboration in supporting students through this life-changing journey.”\nAlso graduating on the day was a cohort of Pharmacy Technician graduates who were awarded a Pearson-BTEC Diploma presented by Sadie Ward McDermont Director of Further Education and Training in LMETB.\nAbi McCormack, Pre-University Nursing graduate won the Oliver Tully overall student of the year award, presented by Dáire Keogh, DCU. Abi encapsulated all the qualities of an exemplary student and was recognised by both her peers and teaching staff in the college for consistently demonstrating academic excellence, compassionate care and overall professionalism within her studies.\nAbi excelled in a clinical setting completing a successful work experience placement at St Mary’s Nursing Home in Drogheda. Abi was successful in gaining one of the 12 reserved Nursing placed in DCU for DIFE graduates and is currently studying the General Nursing integrated with Children’s Nursing degree programme.\nFinbar Murphy from Drogheda Credit Union presented The Outstanding Service to the College Community Award to Jonathan Balfe graduate of Applied Social Studies. The award was presented as an acknowledgement of Jonathan’s contribution to the college community and his outstanding achievements in collaboration, collegiality, and support to other learners.\nAfter making the difficult decision to return to education after spending two decades working in Human Resources, Jonathan showed incredible commitment and dedication to all aspects of college life in DIFE. Jonathan’s enthusiasm in the classroom was palpable, as was his pride in being a student and he completed an exceptional work placement at the Connect Family Resource Centre in Drogheda. Jonathan successfully graduated with Distinction and has progressed to a Level 8 Social Studies degree programme in Trinity College, Dublin.\nAdditionally, Joe Thomas, partner at O’Reilly Thomas Solicitors presented a bursary award to Pre-University Law and Criminology graduate Rhys Cummins who excelled within his studies in Law and Criminology and has subsequently progressed to a Bachelor of Civil Law (Law and Society) degree programme in DCU.\nDIFE Principal Davy McDonnell congratulated all the graduates present on their achievements and wished the overall class of 2024 every success in their future endeavors.\nApplications for full time courses commencing in September 2025 in Drogheda Institute are now open.
