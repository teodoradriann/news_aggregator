    "text": "Steel unions call on government to secure future of Scunthorpe Steel\nThe Chinese owners of British Steel are launching a consultation on closing the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe\nLast updated 48 minutes ago\nUnions are calling on the government to secure the future of steelmaking in Northern Lincolnshire, following the news that British Steel's owner is launching a fresh consultation on closing Scunthorpe's blast furnaces.\nJingye, who operate British Steel, will launch their consultation in June, or at a later date, should an agreement with the UK government be reached.\nScunthorpe steelworks is the UK's last remaining primary steelmaking facility, and employs thousands of people directly and through extensive supply chains throughout the UK.\nA statement on behalf of Jingye says since 2020, they have invested more than £1.2 bn to maintain operations at British Steel, amid ongoing production instability and significant financial losses of around £700k a day.\nInvestments to date include over £300m in strategic capital projects such as a state-of-the-art mast service centre in Skinningrove, a rail stocking facility and a new billet caster.\nDespite this, the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations are no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\nSteel unions Community, GMB and Unite are coming together to call on the government for support.\nCommunity General Secretary Roy Rickhuss CBE said:\n\"This is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country. We urge Jingye and the UK Government to get back around the table to resume negotiations before it is too late.\"\n\"Cruciallly, Jingye have not ruled out retaining the blast furnaces during a transition to low carbon steelmaking if they can secure the backing of the Government.\"\n\"If the government chooses to let Scunthorpe die it would make a mockery of their grand ambitions to deliver growth through massive infrastructure investment, because British Steel is our only steelmaker than can produce the construction steels the country needs for our roads, railways, schools and hospitals.\"\nLinda McCulloch, National Officer for Unite the Union, said:\n\"This is devastating news and there is now a duty on the Government to do everything it can to prevent a catastrophic outcome. As the last primary steelmaking facility in the UK, Scunthorpe is a vital strategic asset which we cannot afford to lose.\"\nCharlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB National Officer, said:\n“This is devastating news for the people of Scunthorpe and the whole of UK steelmaking.\n“But it’s not too late: we urge Jingye and the government to do everything in their power to save this vital domestic industry.”\n\"Deeply worrying time\"\nIn response, Jonathan Reynolds, the Business and Trade Secretary said “I know this will be a deeply worrying time for staff and, while this is British Steel’s decision, we will continue working tirelessly to reach an agreement with the company’s owners to secure its future and protect taxpayers’ money.\n“We’ve been clear there’s a bright future for steelmaking in the UK. We’ve committed up to £2.5 billion to rebuild the sector and will soon publish a Plan for Steel setting out how we can achieve a sustainable future for the workforce, industry and local communities.”\nListen to KISS, KISSTORY and KISS Fresh on our free Rayo app, by hitting the play button on the bottom of your screen and on your smart speaker (‘Play KISS FM’, ‘Play KISSTORY’, ‘Play KISS Fresh’).

    "text": "Boeing Faces Labor Strife: U.S. West Coast Workers Strike Boeing's factory workers on the U.S. West Coast have gone on strike after rejecting a new contract offer, stopping production of key aircraft models. The strike comes amidst an array of issues for Boeing, including regulatory scrutiny and financial strain. The company is seeking to renegotiate and quickly resolve the strike. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 17:30 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 17:30 IST Boeing's factory workers on the U.S. West Coast walked off the job early Friday after rejecting a contract deal, halting production of its best-selling jets. The strike comes as Boeing grapples with major delays and debt, placing the company under increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The strike, the first since 2008, has adversely affected Boeing's stock, leading to a 4.6% drop in U.S. pre-market trading on Friday. New CEO Kelly Ortberg had proposed a 25% pay rise over four years, but this was far short of the workers' demand for a 40% increase. Approximately 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers overwhelmingly voted to strike. \"This is about respect, addressing the past, and fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, head union negotiator. A prolonged strike could exacerbate Boeing's financial woes and disrupt the airline industry, which relies on its aircraft. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "title": "Standing up to Bullies: What Taiwan and Ukraine Can Teach Each Other - CEPA",
    "text": "The first lesson is that social cohesion is a precondition for dealing with external threats. Since the 1980s Taiwan has become a near-model democracy and, looking at Chinese repression, most Taiwanese value their freedoms and reject any form of dictatorship. That was illustrated when Taiwan’s losing parties accepted the result when Democratic Progressive Party candidate, “William” Lai Ching-te, won 40% of the vote in the January 13 election. That is a clear indication of democratic health. Ukraine’s democracy has become steadily stronger since the anti-dictatorial revolutions in 2004 and 2014, and, since the full-scale invasion, many residents who once tilted toward Moscow have switched to backing Kyiv and speaking Ukrainian instead of Russian, their first language. Still, social cohesion is undermined by wartime profiteering, Russian bribes, propaganda, and fatalistic defeatism. Many young men and women volunteer for combat but some have [fled](https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2023/bbc-eye-ukraine-draft-dodgers) abroad or bought exemptions. A second Taiwanese asset is technological prowess. Its semiconductors are treasured everywhere, including mainland China, and now account for [92% of world supply](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/taiwan-china-chips/). These extensive, decades-old business connections have ameliorated political strains with its neighbor. Ukraine’s main export has been grain, vital to the global food supply, yet it was once a computer manufacturing hub for the Soviet Union. That legacy partly explains its [enormous growth](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/keyboard-warriors-ukraines-it-army-switches-to-war-footing) and significant contribution to the war effort. In peacetime, the industry could see significant, further expansion. A third asset is geography. Except for Kinmen and other offshore islands, Taiwan sits 90 to 140 miles from the mainland. The intervening waters are often quite rough and the rocky coastline is inhospitable to amphibious landings. South of the main island, Taiwan’s Penghu archipelago would be a deadly obstacle to any invading force. The largest islands bristle with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, early warning radars and well-trained troops Ukraine, by contrast, borders Russia for hundreds of miles. To reach the occupied Crimean peninsula, however, Russians must travel by sea, a 12-mile-long bridge, or road — all vulnerable to missile attack or sabotage. Neither Taiwan nor Ukraine seeks territory from its Goliath neighbor. Taiwan is content with a status quo in which it can do its own thing, without the formalities of sovereignty, but preferably without intimidation from outside. This posture is difficult for Beijing to accept because its leaders have made it so. Mao Zedong’s Communists paid little heed to Taiwan until 1949 when they prevailed in the civil war. Now they want the entire South China Sea plus the islands that abut the Taiwan Strait. Kyiv wants only to restore the 1991 status quo when the USSR split into 15 independent states. It demands the right of any sovereign state to form alliances or trade with whomever it chooses. Ukraine was subject to Moscow’s brutal whims from 1922 to 1991, and for centuries to Tsarist Russia which, like Putin, tried to extinguish the language and identity of what it called “Little Russia.” Putin’s claim that the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are one is false mythology. His attempted territorial expansion violates international law as egregiously as Xi Jinping’s (for example, his [brutal mistreatment](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/01/china/un-report-china-xinjiang-uyghurs-key-takeaways-intl-hnk/index.html) of the Uyghur people.) Both Taiwan and Ukraine prove that small nations can continue to exist despite the pretensions of powerful neighbors. For Taiwan, deterrence and caution have succeeded, while avoiding red lines that could trigger an invasion. Until Putin’s takeover of Crimea and Donbas in 2014, Ukraine’s capacity to deter was weak. It improved as Ukrainians became more aware of Russia’s intentions, but not enough to stop the 2022 all-out invasion. Ukraine’s successes in driving back the invaders offer lessons for China as well as Taiwan. A small but unified body politic with inspired leadership, backed materially and morally by the US and Europe, can make conquest difficult and costly if not impossible. Even if the invaders could prevail, they would gain a country in ruins with a very hostile population. Win or lose in Ukraine, Russians have killed any prospect of constructive interaction with the West and many other parts of the world. This is not to say that Taiwan has done enough. It must do much more to buttress deterrence and make itself a porcupine too prickly to harass. Taiwan’s defense budget is [increasing to record levels](https://www.cfr.org/blog/taiwan-announced-record-defense-budget-it-enough-deter-china) and will provide for more US and European arms in its arsenal. Until recently, however, conscripted recruits served only four months. The term has been increased to one year, but that is still a short time to harden soldiers and help them master modern weaponry. It is probably too late for Ukraine to restore any kind of friendly or business relationship with the Putin regime, not least because Russia owes Ukraine [at least $4 trillion] for damage to lives, property, and the environment. For Taiwan and China, however, it might still be possible to build constructively on shared heritage and economic interdependence. They could learn not only from the Ukraine-Russia tragedy but also from the US and UK, which turned a century of war and hostility into a fruitful alliance. US war hawks in 1812 wanted to annex British Canada. Now Canada and its former antagonist are major trade partners sharing defense systems. For the Russians as well as the Chinese, the lesson is that policies for mutual gain are less costly and more effective than bullying.
