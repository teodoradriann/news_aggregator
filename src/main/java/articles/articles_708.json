    "title": "After Honeymoon Murder, Maharashtra Woman Kills Husband With Axe",
    "text": "Days after the Raja Raghuvanshi honeymoon murder case, another chilling incident has come to light from Maharashtra, where a woman killed her husband with an axe while he was sleeping - just three weeks after they got married. The incident took place on the night of June 10 shortly after the newlywed couple fought, officials said on Thursday. According to the police, the couple got married on May 23 in Maharashtra's Sangli district. On Tuesday night, the two fought aggressively, following which the victim, Anil Lokhande, went to sleep around midnight. In a fit of rage, the woman, Radhika Lokhande, picked up an axe and hit her husband on the head, officials said. He died on the spot. Minutes later, Radhika called her cousin and informed about the crime she committed. The police arrested Radhika on Wednesday and sent her to a two-day police custody, officials said. A case has been registered against her under Section 103 (1) of the BNS (murder). Preliminary investigation indicates family discord to be the reason behind the murder. However, officials are conducting further investigation, they said. This comes in the backdrop of the sinister murder of Indore-based businessman, Raja Raghuvanshi, by his wife, Sonam, during their honeymoon in Meghalaya last month. The murder plan was orchestrated by Sonam, her lover Raj Kushwaha, and his three friends - who committed the actual murder. Raja and Sonam got married on May 11. They left for their honeymoon in Meghalaya on May 20, before going \"missing\" three days later. When their family members could not reach them, they reached out to the police. What initially started as a probe to find the couple, turned into a murder investigation when Raja's body was found in a gorge on June 2, ten days after the brutal crime. His preliminary autopsy report revealed that he was attacked twice - once each on the back and front of his head. On the night of June 7, the 'missing' wife was found in an unconscious state at a 'dhaba' in Ghazipur. She was taken to the Ghazipur Medical College for treatment, where she surrendered before the police, and was subsequently taken into custody. Sonam, 24, and her lover, Raj, were arrested on Monday along with their three aides, Akash Rajput, Anand Kurmi, and Vishal Singh Chauhan. They have been sent to eight days police custody.",

    "text": "You can make your morning coffee extra tasty with “one of the healthiest” supplements, which is also said to promote brain health.\nMost people can’t imagine going about their day without coffee and a lot of them prefer non-dairy alternatives to add to it. That’s why [Starbucks has stopped charging extra](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/starbucks-new-rule-will-save-non-dairy-milk-lovers-10-on-every-order/) for alternative milk, thus reducing the cost of each [drink](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/food-and-drink/) by more than 10%.\nTasty supplement in coffee boosts brain health\nIf you prefer adding a non-dairy alternative to your [coffee](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/coffee/), Dr. Robert Love recommends switching to a tasty supplement that makes you “think better.”\nHe personally uses MCT oil made from coconut, which is great for your brain and body. The healthy supplement also enhances the taste of [coffee](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/coffee/).\nConsuming three tablespoons of MCT oil daily is believed to improve brain performance. The supplement is “turned into ketone bodies” by the liver, which provides energy to your brain in addition to other [health](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/health/) benefits.\n- CAN YOU GUESS? :\n[American can’t believe British McDonald’s doesn’t have UK’s second favorite condiment](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/american-cant-believe-british-mcdonalds-doesnt-have-uks-second-favorite-condiment/)\n[Consuming coffee on an empty stomach](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/health-expert-weighs-in-on-debate-about-drinking-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach/) can cause unpleasant symptoms such as insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, nausea, and increased heart rate.\nHowever, Dr. Robert says you can drink coffee while fasting by including MCT oil or MCT oil power in it.\nCommon mistakes to avoid while preparing coffee\nAlthough a moderate amount of coffee is said to have health benefits, some common mistakes people repeatedly make while preparing can negatively impact the brain.\nAccording to Dr. Robert, coffee is the second on the list of crops grown with the most pesticides. So, he strictly recommends using organic coffee that’s Light Roast with more antioxidants.\nEspresso and French Press are the most commonly used methods to prepare the popular beverage. But the neuroscientist suggests brewing it with the drip method as it’s more effective than the others.\nDr. Robert Love is a neuroscientist, researcher, and educator, who specializes in helping people prevent Alzheimer’s disease with science. He leads a research team investigating a new FDA drug to help reverse Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.",

    "text": "Maden in der Mülltonne bei Sommer-Hitze: So lässt sich das Ungeziefer bekämpfen\nIn den heißen Sommermonaten haben viele mit einem Problem zu kämpfen: Maden in der Mülltonne. Doch es gibt einfache Maßnahmen, um die kleinen Larven wieder loszuwerden.\nWenn die Temperaturen steigen, vermehren sich Insekten besonders schnell – auch rund um den Hausmüll. Fliegen nutzen die Hitze, um ihre Eier in den Tonnen abzulegen. Daraus entwickeln sich innerhalb kurzer Zeit weiße Maden. Diese treten meist in großer Zahl auf und sorgen trotz ihrer Harmlosigkeit bei vielen für Ekel. Doch wie lässt sich das verhindern?\nMaden vorbeugen: Mit einfachen Maßnahmen den Befall verhindern\nUm Maden erst gar keine Chance zu geben, sollte der Müll regelmäßig entsorgt werden. Eine wöchentliche Leerung der Tonne und anschließende Reinigung kann schon viel ausrichten.\nWichtig ist außerdem, dass der Deckel immer gut verschlossen bleibt. Wer noch mehr Schutz möchte, kann eine Gummidichtung am Deckelrand anbringen oder einen speziellen Deckel für Biotonnen verwenden.\nMüll trocken halten – Maden mögen es feucht und warm\nDa sich Maden besonders in feuchten und warmen Umgebungen wohlfühlen, sollte der Müll möglichst trocken bleiben. Vor allem im Biomüll wird Feuchtigkeit schnell zum Problem. Der Restmüll ist meist recht luftdicht in Plastiktüten eingepackt, wodurch wenig ein und ausdringt. echo24.de erklärt, wann Müll in eine Tüte gehört und wann nicht.\nLaut „GEO“ helfen beim Trockenhalten von Mülltonnen Materialien wie Zeitungspapier, Sägespäne, trockenes Gras oder Heu, um Feuchtigkeit zu binden. All diese Materialien dürfen auch in die Biotonne. Auch der Standort der Tonne spielt eine Rolle: Sie sollte an einem kühlen, trockenen Platz stehen.\nSo wird man Maden wieder los – einfache Hausmittel im Einsatz\nHat sich der Nachwuchs der Fliegen bereits breitgemacht oder war die Vorsorge nicht erfolgreich, gibt es laut „GEO“ einfache Hausmittel gegen Maden. Eine Möglichkeit: Kalk in die Tonne streuen. Der entzieht den Maden Feuchtigkeit. Auch Gesteinsmehl kann verwendet werden.\nWer eine Sprühflasche hat, kann auf zwei bewährte Mischungen zurückgreifen: Entweder Wasser mit mehreren Esslöffeln Essig oder Essigessenz, oder eine Mischung aus einem Liter abgekochtem Wasser mit einem Esslöffel Pfeffer. Beide Lösungen lassen sich direkt auf die Maden sprühen.\nSelbst gebaute Mückenfalle gegen neue Eier\nUm zu verhindern, dass neue Fliegen ihre Eier ablegen, empfiehlt „GEO“ den Bau einer einfachen Mückenfalle: Dafür zwei Teile Wasser mit drei Teilen Fruchtsaft, einem Teil Essig und einigen Tropfen Spülmittel mischen. Die Mischung in ein Glas geben und direkt neben der Biotonne aufstellen. Das Spülmittel reduziert die Oberflächenspannung – Fliegen, die auf der Flüssigkeit landen, ertrinken sofort.",

I thrive in a team atmosphere... so many tennis heads giving information. It helps you to think clearly.\"\nPegula's 10th-ranked teammate Fritz kept the tie alive despite a thigh strain he blamed on over-training, defeating Cameron Norrie 7-6 (5), 6-4.\n\"I strained something but got through it,\" said Fritz. \"Cam and I have played so many times (14). It's always a battle, always close.\"\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic opens his season for Serbia later against China's Zhang Zhizhen, with the Chinese team on a high after beating the Czech Republic 3-0.\nIn Sydney, Leylah Fernandez led Canada to a fighting victory over Chile with the former US Open finalist winning her singles rubber and then backing up in a decisive mixed doubles.\nStory continues The 35th-ranked Fernandez got Canada off to a perfect start, cruising past Chile's Daniela Seguel 6-2, 6-3 in 73 minutes.\nWith Canadian number one Felix Auger-Aliassime sitting out the men's singles, 314th-ranked Steven Diez stepped up but was toppled by world number 19 Nicolas Jarry 7-5, 6-4.\nIt set up a deciding mixed doubles, with Fernandez teaming with Diez to battle past Seguel and Tomas Barrios Vera 7-5, 4-6, 10-8.\n\"I'm extremely happy with the way I played,\" said Fernandez, who was part of the Canadian team that won the Billie Jean King Cup for the first time this year.\nThe 21-year-old broke five times in her singles clash against a player in her first WTA Tour-level singles match in nearly two years, using the serve-and-volley tactic well.\n\"First match of the season so had some nerves, but happy with the way I was able to handle it,\" she said.\nmp/str/pbt\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "KIRO Arrest of 4 teens in U-District leads to stolen cars, gun, ‘vast array’ of pot products KIRO 7 News Staff December 29, 2023 at 12:14 AM · 1 min read Link Copied Read full article\nTeens who threw items out of a moving car’s window likely regret their move after it caught the attention of a bystander who then flagged down officers.\nSeattle Police said the Dec. 20 incident happened in the University District. Officers who were alerted to the strange behavior drove to the area near the intersection of Northeast 41st Street and Roosevelt Way Northeast to search for the car in question.\nOfficers who found the car saw that it had damage consistent with other stolen vehicles.\nAs they approached the car, they saw two teens inside and two others standing outside nearby.\nWhen officers tried to speak with the group, all four teens took off running. A parking enforcement officer nearby heard the incident on the radio and gave officers information to help find the fleeing teens, who were found hiding behind a dumpster nearby.\nPolice arrested all four teens — ages 14, 15, 16 and 17.\nThe three older teens were booked into the King County Child and Family Justice Center for investigation of possession of a stolen firearm and possession of a stolen vehicle.\nAs for the 14-year-old, officers requested a charge for obstructing a public officer.\nOfficers then began to check records on the silver Hyundai the teens had been driving and for another damaged Hyundai parked nearby and discovered that had both been stolen.\nWhen police searched the car that had been driven by the teens, they found a gun that was stolen out of Renton, along with a “vast quantity” of cannabis products.\nThey also recovered two Tasers that were dropped by the teens as officers ran after them.\nView comments",
