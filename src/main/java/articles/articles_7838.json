    "title": "‘No joy in our hearts’: Bethlehem’s Christians face heartbreak at Christmas – DNyuz",
    "text": "Bethlehem, occupied West Bank – At Christmas, Noha Helmi Tarazi normally decorates her home with a large tree, which she describes as a symbol of light and joy.\nThe 87-year-old prepares the house for her family, who gather here each year, and makes Christmas sweets and large, festive meals. She usually places presents under the Christmas tree for her grandchildren, taking care to wrap them and label them with their names.\nThis year, no one will gather in her home. Even the children do not feel like celebrating, she says.\n“There is no joy left in our hearts,” she says.\nIn the birthplace of Jesus Christ, the celebrations for Christmas are on hold. The decision to cancel Christmas has not been taken lightly, but it is one the church and community here are all united on, to show their solidarity with the Palestinians facing Israeli bombardment and a total siege in the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli bombing and artillery fire have killed more than 20,000 people in Gaza since the war began on October 7, including at least 8,000 children. More than 300 people have been killed in the occupied West Bank, too, either by Israeli soldiers or by settlers who often attack with cover from Israeli troops.\nThe war has brought Bethlehem’s tourism – a bedrock of its economy – to a standstill at the time of the year when it usually peaks. Where visitors from around the world would usually throng Bethlehem’s markets around Christmas, the streets are empty this year.\nBut even if tourists were around, there’s no festivity among the residents of Bethlehem, many of whom have close family members in Gaza.\n“How can we celebrate Christmas in the midst of this genocidal war?” asks Tarazi, known to those close to her as Um Shadi. “How can we celebrate when people in Gaza struggle to get even one meal a day?”\nThe images and news of the suffering in Gaza under Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion are too much for her. Um Shadi, whose family lives in Gaza City, says she has been particularly disturbed by videos of people fleeing towards the sea and being forced to boil seawater to make it drinkable.\nShe grew up in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City and lived there through her 20s during the 1960s. She has “beautiful memories of the sea”, where she used to swim at night. People lived in peace, she says.\nLife became harder after she graduated with a degree in English literature from Cairo University in 1967. She was unable to return to Gaza because it was occupied by Israel that year, and instead, she spent the next 10 years in Libya, where her brothers also lived and where she met her husband.\nShe eventually returned to the occupied West Bank, where she made her home and built her Christmas rituals with her family – traditions she will skip this year. ‘This Christmas, may God have mercy on them’\nAll signs of Christmas have disappeared from the streets and homes of Bethlehem. Usually, people flock to Manger Square , which is adorned with decorations, to watch fireworks. None of that will happen this year.\nLots of people in Bethlehem and the surrounding area have relatives in Gaza. Um Shadi herself has lost a brother and a sister since the war began.\nHer brother died on October 17 after being unable to receive a life-saving gallbladder operation because of the aerial bombardment of hospitals in the Strip.\nJust a few days later, one of her sisters died in an air strike on St Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church, where the family had taken shelter. Another sister lost a leg during the same bombardment.\nIt has always been difficult to see her family, even before the war, but now she can barely even speak to them because of the telecommunications blackouts in Gaza.\nUm Shadi was unable to attend another sister’s funeral in the enclave before the war because she was not granted a permit to travel there. Instead, her niece had to take a video of the ceremony for her.\nIn happier years, some Christians from Gaza had been able to obtain permits from the Israeli authorities to travel from Gaza to Bethlehem at Christmas – something her sisters and her friend Rose often did, she says.\n“My sisters used to visit me, and I say this year on Christmas, may God have mercy on them.”\nThe agony of not being able to communicate with her family in Gaza is unbearable, she adds. It has brought her to “the brink of despair”.\nChristmas used to be the one joyful event that everyone could count on each year, Um Shadi says. Now, that has gone, too.\nThe post ‘No joy in our hearts’: Bethlehem’s Christians face heartbreak at Christmas appeared first on Al Jazeera .",

    "text": "Semarang, C Java (ANTARA) - The Central Java government has assured that catering businesses involved in the Free Nutritious Meals program trial have been verified and will follow standards set by the National Nutrition Agency (BGN). Yunita Dyah Suminar, Head of the Central Java Health Office, stated on Thursday that meal providers in the program's trial are primarily micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). She confirmed that these MSME-level catering businesses have been verified and will adhere to the BGN’s guidelines in preparing nutritious meals. In addition to collaborating with BGN, the Health Office will also coordinate with relevant regional apparatus organizations (OPDs) for the trial's implementation.

In Central Java, the program trial will be conducted in Brebes, Wonosobo, and Kebumen, as these regions have higher poverty rates. Suminar shared that during the trial, free meals will be provided to students during their first break of the school day for 25 consecutive days.

Each meal costs Rp15,000 (less than US$1), with a menu including animal and plant-based protein and carbohydrates,\" she said. The trial's evaluation will be conducted in stages and will address issues related to meal provision, distribution, and menu feasibility.",

    "text": "West Greenville food pantry battling growing food insecurity According to area nonprofits, hunger is consuming the upstate. And as inflation rises, more men and women rely on food pantries and other resources to make ends meet. St. Anthony of Padua relies fully on its parishioners and outside donations to feed the many people who walk to their pantry doors four times a week. But the need in West Greenville is growing and showing no signs of stopping. Thursday, volunteers loaded freezers with donations, bags with food, and food pantry goers like Lenita Copeland with what they'll need for the weekend. \"Due to the economy, you know they help out with a lot of things, especially food,\" Copeland. \"When it gets a little tight, you have these people here to lean on, so you don't have to be without.\" St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church has fed the community for more than eight years decades and officially opened its pantry about 25 years ago. But over the past couple years, they've gone from just a few regulars to about 180 bags of food a day. \"I don't really know what the numbers were when I started, but it's gone up every month since I've been here,\" said Jane Guthrie, a volunteer. \"I think COVID had a lot to do with people out of work,\" said Jay Pitts, head of Ministry and Stewardship. U.S. inflation rose dramatically in 2021, coinciding with an increase in area homelessness and poverty levels, according to the Greenville Homeless Alliance. Though inflation has come down, many people are still recovering. \"Everybody we give food to is not homeless. There's just a lot of food insecurity with the cost of groceries now,\" Guthrie said. As hunger in West Greenville consumes more community members, St. Anthony of Padua feeds them out of a closet, relying on the generosity of others to fill it each week. \"We'd like a bigger space, but we're still able to do what we do,\" Pitts said. The church is planning to move into a bigger facility in the near future to accommodate newfound need. If you'd like to learn more, donate your time, food, or money, click this link.",

    "title": "The warmest December in Bremer County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Bremer County, Iowa from 1901-2000 was 20.3. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Bremer County, Iowa experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Bremer County, Iowa history.",

    "text": "(CNN) — His face has become instantly recognizable around the world: A red-haired baby boy holding a pink elephant toy, looking directly into the camera with a toothless smile.\nHis name is Kfir Bibas, and he is the youngest of the 253 hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups during the terror attacks against Israel on October 7.\nOn Thursday, Kfir turns one — if he is still alive.\nThe baby boy was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel alongside his parents Yarden and Shiri, and his four-year old brother Ariel.\nHis family held an event in Tel Aviv on Thursday, commemorating what they called “the saddest birthday in the world.”\nLarge crowd of people filled the square in central Tel Aviv that has become known as the “Hostages Plaza.” Many were holding orange balloons, a nod to Kfir’s red hair. A large screen displaying the number of days the hostages have been held in Gaza stood nearby - 103.\nPeople are also reading…\nOn Tuesday, a smaller group of friends and relatives of the Bibas family held an event at Nir Oz on Tuesday, commemorating Kfir’s birthday with a large balloon display and a cake featuring the famous photo of Kfir with the pink elephant.\nThe same picture was propped up next to Israel’s President Israeli Isaac Herzog when he spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n“Kfir Bibas is not the enemy of the Hamas. The Hamas don’t have any rules,” Jimmy Miller, cousin of the Bibas family, told CNN on Wednesday.\n“You know, any rules even from the Quran because in the Quran, you cannot do damage to kids … so Hamas breaks all the rules of the Islam,” he added.\nIt is not clear whether Kfir and his family are still alive. The two boys and their mother were\nnot released from Gaza during the temporary truce in late November, despite the fact that the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas called for all women and children to be set free.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at that time they believed the family was being held hostage by other militia groups and not by Hamas.\nHowever, later that week, Hamas said, without providing any evidence, that Kfir, his brother and his mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nThe IDF said at that time the it was assessing the claim. Asked on Thursday whether there was any conclusion in that investigation, a spokesperson told CNN: “The IDF has no comment.”\nA few days after making the claim that the family were dead, Hamas released a video of Yarden Bibas, Kfir’s father, in which he blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two children. Bibas appeared to be in extreme distress in the video and was very likely speaking under duress.\nThe IDF called the video a “cruel act of psychological terror which Hamas is using against families of hostages.”\nIsrael believes 253 hostages were taken into Gaza during the Hamas attack on October 7. Following hostage releases and one rescue, the Prime Minister’s Office says 132 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 105 are alive and 27 dead.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Markus Howard debutará con la Selección Nacional en la última ventana clasificatoria del AmeriCup 2025\nPuerto Rico enfrentará a Estados y Cuba el 20 y 23 de febrero en el Coliseo Roberto Clemente, de San Juan.\nPUBLICIDAD\nMarkus Howard ya tiene fecha para su debut con la Selección Nacional.\nLa Federación de Baloncesto de Puerto Rico (FBPUR) anunció el jueves que Howard se estrenará con el quinteto patrio en la tercera y última ventana clasificatoria del AmeriCup 2025. Puerto Rico verá acción el 20 y 23 de febrero, cuando reciba a Estados Unidos y Cuba en el Coliseo Roberto Clemente, de San Juan.\n“Markus es un jugador que llevamos tiempo tratando de que juegue con nosotros y no habíamos podido por su disponibilidad. Su capacidad de tiro es muy buena. Es un jugador muy eficiente saliendo de cortinas y no hay muchos con ese estilo en Puerto Rico”, dijo el dirigente del Equipo Nacional, Carlos González, a Primera Hora.\n“El nivel que ha jugado por los pasados años es muy alto, y esperamos que sea de gran ayuda para nosotros contar con su habilidad ofensiva”, agregó.\nEl escolta, de 25 años, tenía intenciones de representar a Puerto Rico en el Repechaje Olímpico y en París 2024, pero decidió posponer su debut por el nacimiento de su hijo.\nHoward ha militado con el Baskonia en la Liga ACB de España desde la temporada 2022-23. El año pasado, recibió el premio Alphonso Ford, que reconoce al líder de anotaciones de la Euroliga. En apenas su segunda campaña en la competición de clubes europeos, promedió 19.5 unidades por juego y estableció un nuevo récord de anotación en una campaña con 759 tantos en 38 partidos.\nSin embargo, ha tenido una discreta actuación esta temporada con una media de 12.5 unidades por desafío, su cifra más baja desde que se integró al Baskonia.\nHoward es hijo de la puertorriqueña Noemí Santana y hermano del también base del Equipo Nacional Jordan Howard, quien juega con los Osos de Manatí en el Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN).\nPuerto Rico ocupa el segundo puesto del Grupo D del clasificatorio al AmeriCup, con un récord de 2-2 y una diferencia de puntos de -26. El primer lugar le pertenece a Estados Unidos, con una marca de 3-1 y una diferencia de puntos de 72. Cuba (2-2, -1) y Bahama (1-3, -45) están terceros y cuartos, respectivamente.\nEl AmeriCup 2025 se celebrará del 23 al 31 de agosto del 2025 en Managua, Nicaragua.",

    "text": "[Police: Purported Recording of Pikesville HS Principal Was Not Authentic, Contained AI Content](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/police-former-pikesville-high-ad-facing-charges-ai-generated-voice-hoax/60603313) Tommie Clark et al., WBAL-TV, April 25, 2024 The former athletic director at Pikesville High School has been arrested in connection to an AI-generated impersonation of the school’s principal. Dazhon Darien, 31, faces multiple charges, including stalking, theft, disruption of school operations, and retaliation against a witness, according to charging documents obtained by 11 News. Police said the charges are connected to an investigation that started on Jan. 17 into a voice recording circulated on social media that was alleged to have been the voice of the school’s principal, Eric Eiswert. Police said the audio clip, which was an alleged race-based commentary on the school’s students and teachers, was spread on social media. That led to the temporary removal of Eiswert from the school, as well as many hate-filled messages on social media and numerous calls to the school. Police said Thursday afternoon that detectives have conclusive evidence based on a forensic analysis by the FBI that the recording was not authentic. Police said the analysis indicated the recording contained traces of AI-generated content. Detectives then sought an additional analysis by the University of California, Berkley, which arrived at the same findings as the FBI’s analysis. Police said investigators believe Darien made the recording to retaliate against Eiswert, who, at the time, was pursuing an investigation into the potential mishandling of school funds. {snip} The charging documents state that Eiswert believed Darien was responsible for the clip because he believed Darien was tech-savvy and familiar with AI, and a grievance was fueled by Darien’s contract not being renewed due to work-performance issues that included terminating a coach without approval and allegedly paying teachers under the table for helping him with his job, which is the subject of an internal audit. {snip} Police said Darien had used the school network to search for AI tools. While Darien originally denied involvement, police have since connected an email address that sent out the audio clip to Darien’s grandmother’s home in Los Angeles that has a recovery phone number being Darien’s own cellphone. Police said the audio clip was originally sent to a friend group of three teachers. One of the educators admitted to police she sent the clip to news outlets and a student who she knew would spread the clip. An investigation into the other teachers involved continues. {snip}",
