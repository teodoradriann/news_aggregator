    "text": "Oscars 2024: Celebs Wear 'Red Pins' To Demand Ceasefire In Gaza In a powerful display of solidarity, prominent celebrities, including Billie Eilish, Finneas, Mark Ruffalo, Ava DuVernay, and Ramy Youssef, graced the red carpet at the 96th Academy Awards adorned with small red pins. These pins, featuring the silhouette of a hand with a black heart positioned at the palm, turned heads and raised questions among fans regarding their significance. The pins, as revealed by \"Poor Things\" actor Ramy Youssef in an interview with Variety, symbolize a call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the ongoing [Israel-Hamas conflict](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-68-journalists-killed-so-far-as-israel-continues-to-pound-gaza-623967.html). Youssef explained that the pins are part of a creatives-led initiative demanding peace in Gaza, emphasizing the need for safety, justice, and lasting peace for the [Palestinian people](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/cries-of-child-amputees-fill-the-air-in-gaza-city-620052.html). The big fashion message at the Oscars tonight was the red Artists4Ceasefire pins worn by attendees including Mark Ruffalo, Billie Eilish and Ramy Youssef.— Tony Bravo (@TonyBravoSF) [pic.twitter.com/SdecTY1kVW] [March 11, 2024] According to the New York Times, the pins were provided by Artists4Ceasefire, a collective of celebrities and entertainment industry members who signed an open letter urging President Biden to call for a ceasefire. Notable signatories of the letter include Jessica Chastain, Quinta Brunson, Richard Gere, America Ferrera, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong'o, and Mahershala Ali. The open letter calls for urgent action to halt the violence in Israel and Gaza, highlighting the human toll of the conflict and urging leaders to honor the lives in the Holy Land. It specifically emphasizes the impact on children and refugees, stressing the necessity of allowing humanitarian aid to reach the affected civilians. \"The pin symbolizes collective support for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza,\" stated Artists4Ceasefire in a news release. In addition to the red pins, actors Milo Machado-Graner and Swann Arlaud of 'Anatomy of a Fall' wore pins featuring the Palestinian flag. Meanwhile, outside the Dolby Theatre, several protestors took to the streets of Hollywood, disrupting traffic to express their support for Palestine. The Oscar ceremony, traditionally a platform for celebrating achievements in the film industry, saw celebrities leverage their visibility to advocate for peace and draw attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region.",

    "text": "Living\nOwner Runs to Help After Dog Goes Potty in -30 Degrees-’Can’t Make It Back’\nA home security camera captured an owner's response to rescue her dog in below-freezing temperatures, and viewers are impressed with her quickness.\nIn a TikTok posted to the account @ellysamw earlier this week, a home security camera filmed a dog who started making his way back inside the house. The path he walked on looked to have been used constantly. He knew the routine: get out, do business, get back inside. However, he stopped short of the door after his doggy sibling interrupted him.\nThe interference caused him to freeze in place. Because it was -30 degrees Celsius (-22 Fahrenheit), he needed assistance, and within seconds, the owner ran outside. The text on the video explained that when it is that cold, \"the pups sometimes can't make it back inside,\" which is why she is always on standby.\nShe informed viewers in the caption that she monitors her dogs to \"make sure they can get back to the door,\" and if they freeze, as her canine did in the video, she's prepared to pick them up and bring them inside.\nThe owner shared in a comment that this dog in particular is the \"toughest of the three,\" but the -30 degrees got to him that morning.\nViewer Reactions\nThe video quickly amassed 1.8 million views, 87,200 likes and 616 comments as of Thursday. Most people applauded the owner's quick response, while others scorned her for letting her dogs outside without winter protection.\n\"Momma was there so quick!\" said a viewer, and a second person echoed: \"The fact he had to wait 3 seconds for you proves you're a great dog mom.\"\nAnother added: \"Awe, I don't blame him the cold sucks!!\"\nThose who disapproved asked why she didn't put on a coat or have them wear gloves on their paws, which she addressed in a video posted on Tuesday.\nThat clip showed her dogs sprinting around the yard playing with each other in the snow. She said this is how her dogs act \"99 percent\" of the time in winter. She doesn't think it is necessary to clothe her dogs for a potty break because they have fur and finish quickly.\n\"...sometimes they just get too far before realizing they are cold and I'll help them whenever needed,\" part of the caption reads.\nOtherwise, she said if she walks them in cold weather, she makes them wear doggy boots.\nNewsweek reached out to @ellysamw via TikTok for additional information.\nRelated Articles\n2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC.\nThis story was originally published January 23, 2025 at 3:09 PM.",

Local first responders return home after two weeks of assistance after Hurricane Helene Two busloads full with members of Maryland Task Force 1 returned to Rockville, Maryland, on Thursday, after spending two weeks assisting victims of Hurricane Helene.\nTired search and rescue workers unloaded their bags from the belly of the buses and then into the warehouse that serves as headquarters for the search and rescue team, which is made up of members from several Maryland jurisdictions and D.C.\nThe team began its work in Georgia, before FEMA reassigned them to North Carolina.\nJosh Kurland, a captain with Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service, was the task force leader for the deployment.\n“One of the biggest challenges was something we call ‘strainers,’ where there’s large debris piles caught on bridges or trees,” he said. “We did a bunch of work with our K-9s, both on boats and on land, delayering and using our K-9s to clear areas and determine whether there was any human scent in those areas.”\nWhile other teams rescued trapped residents, Maryland Task Force 1’s tasks included helping remove debris from homes and businesses and bolstering the infrastructure.\n“In Valdosta, there was a ton of trees, so it was more of a wind event in Valdosta, so just driving was a problem,” Kurland said. “Operating in North Carolina, it was definitely more of a flood operation.”\nTask force member Nathan Wondimu said he’d never seen such a level of resilience from natural disaster victims.\n“The sense of community in those areas, they were all supporting each other.”\nAsked how victims whose lives had been turned upside down by Hurricane Helene were coping, Wondimu said, “The ones who did lose an insurmountable amount that none of us could imagine, they were just grateful to be there in the first place, and present.”\nWhile the task force team that responded for Hurricane Helene has returned home, other members of the 45-person team were deployed to assist after Hurricane Milton.",
