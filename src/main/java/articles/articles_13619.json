    "text": "Pet Pals TV | Local rescue dog’s journey from near-death to recovery\nINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — A severely injured dog found face down in the cold has been given a second chance at life, thanks to the dedication of local animal rescue organizations. The heartwarming story was shared on WISH-TV’s morning show with Daybreak Anchor Jeremy Jenkins and Pet Pals TV host Patty Spitler.\n“This lady and her husband have rescued and saved over 700 dogs and cats and found homes for them,” Spitler said, introducing Pamela Terhune, founder of [Grateful Rescue](https://www.gratefulrescue.org/).\n“I want to give a shout out to Muncie Animal Care because they found him face down in the cold,” said Terhune about Saul, a dog she describes as “a Christmas miracle. “Nobody even knew what he was.”\nWhen discovered, Saul was in such poor condition that he couldn’t lift his head, and his features were barely distinguishable.\n“He couldn’t lift his head, but they did not euthanize him,” Terhune said.. “As long as we see improvement and quality of life, we’re going to help him in that fight.”\nWhile Saul still cannot walk independently, his recovery journey includes acupuncture treatments and the use of a specially fitted wheelchair. His progress has been remarkable: From complete immobility to now being able to hold his head up.\n“Look at him holding his head up,” Spitler said during the interview, pointing out the dramatic improvement. “He was not able to hold his head up when we got him.”\nSaul receives ongoing treatment at West View Animal Clinic in Muncie, where his care requires significant resources. The rescue organization maintains a firm stance on giving animals a chance at life, never euthanizing for financial reasons if there’s hope for recovery. Those interested in contributing to Saul’s care can [click here](https://www.gratefulrescue.org/) to make donations.\nViewers can learn more about the efforts to help Saul and other rescue animals by watching Pet Pals TV every Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m. on WISH-TV, or [click here](https://www.petpalstv.com/).\n[News at your fingertips!](/email-alerts/)Stay informed with\n[Indiana](/indiana-news/),\n[Local](/local/), and\n[National News](/national/)straight to your inbox.",

    "text": "Source: NDTV News | Title: Nvidia Criticises Reported Biden Plan For AI Chip Export Curbs\nNvidia’s Finkle said the reported policy was disguised as an “anti-China move”.\nNvidia on Thursday criticized a reported plan by the Joe Biden administration to impose new restrictions on AI chip exports, saying that the outgoing U.S. leader should not “preempt incoming President Trump” by enacting a last-minute policy.\n“We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries,” Nvidia Vice President Ned Finkle said in an emailed statement.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment outside regular business hours.\nReuters reported exclusive details last month on the Commerce Department’s plan for approving global AI chip exports while also preventing bad actors from accessing them. A key aim of the restrictions is to keep AI from supercharging China’s military capabilities.\nBloomberg News reported on Thursday that new export regulations could be announced soon, adding that a group of U.S. adversaries would effectively get blocked from importing these chips, while the vast majority of the world would face limits on the total computing power that can go to one country.\nNvidia’s Finkle said the reported policy was disguised as an “anti-China move” and warned that the extreme country cap will affect computers around the world and push the world to alternative technologies.\n“This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,” Finkle said.\nThe Information Technology Industry Council, representing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Meta, has said the rule would place arbitrary constraints on U.S. companies’ ability to sell computing systems overseas and cede the global market to competitors.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, in his first term in office, imposed restrictions on the sale of U.S. technology to China citing national security. Trump’s second term begins on Jan. 20.\nNvidia shares were down more than 1% during extended trading on Thursday after the Bloomberg report.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\nFollow us: Read More | Source: NDTV News",

    "text": "Allegra Gutta (née Naim) was born in 1928 in Benghazi, Libya. Her father Vittorio Naim was a merchant who owned a store in the city market. Allegra was the fifth child in the family and had nine brothers and sisters: Jamila, Julia, Yosef, Reuven, Dina, Shushana, Lydia, Eli, and Fortune. In April 1941, with the British retreat from Benghazi and before the arrival of the Italian armed forces, several Benghazi residents rioted against the Jews, looting Jewish homes and stores. In early 1942, the Italians deported most of Benghazi’s 3,000 Jews to the Giado concentration camp, over 1,000 kilometers west of Benghazi in the Libyan Desert. Allegra was deported with her parents and most of her siblings, except for her two older brothers Yosef and Reuven who managed to escape, enlisted in the British army, and served in Italy and Eretz Israel (Mandatory Palestine). The deportees were transported in trucks over several days, in the blazing heat and without receiving any food or water. Several died en route. Allegra relates: \"We were in the Giado camp for one year and two months. The overcrowding was terrible, and we were starving. Many contracted diseases that broke out due to the contamination, such as typhus spread by lice. I took care of patients every day, including my father, who contracted typhus.\" Allegra’s father, her younger sister Fortune, and her older sister Jamila were among the hundreds of Jews who succumbed to typhus at Giado. Their bodies were left at the camp without a burial ceremony or a marked grave. The British liberated Giado in 1943, and Allegra and her family returned to Benghazi. Allegra’s two brothers were discharged from the British army and came back to Benghazi, where they repaired their destroyed home. The family once again lived in their beachfront house on Via Marina. Allegra helped to support her family by working at the British army canteen, where she learned English. In September 1948, the Naims escaped to Tripoli in the dead of night and reached Naples, Italy, with the help of the Jewish Agency. From there, they took a train to Milan. In November 1948, the family sailed from Bari, Italy, to Israel on the Teti. They began life in Israel at the immigrant center in Binyamina before moving to Old Jaffa, and they finally settled in Holon a year later. In April 1952, Allegra married Aaron Gino Gutta z”l, and they made their home in Tel Aviv. Allegra relates: \"As a Holocaust survivor, I try to live a full and active life. I am in daily contact with many friends, I am part of a group of Libyan-Arabic and Italian speakers, I exercise at the gym, play bridge, and enjoy my family. That is my victory over the Nazis.\" Allegra and Aaron Gino z”l have two children, three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.",

    "text": "MARSHALL COUNTY, W.Va. — Denzel Ray Butler is a West Virginia native who raised his family in Marshall County. He is a World War II veteran who is about to celebrate turning 101 years old. On May 23, 1923, Butler was born in Gilmer County. He moved to Moundsville as a teenager, where he met his wife on Jefferson Avenue as she was coming out of a movie theater. At the age of 19, Butler received a draft notice and served in the Army Air Corps in New Guinea and Australia. “I can’t really explain it to you. You kind of have to have that experience to really know what it’s like,” Butler said. He worked in and on planes, as well as on vehicles, large and small, and recounts a time when he flew in a bomber plane with no bombs inside. He says that although some veterans may struggle with PTSD after a war, he has never had that experience. “I didn't play on it after the war. I don't dream about it, I've never had one nightmare about being in New Guniea or Australia. Not one,” Butler said. When he left for New Guinea, he was gone for 3 years and didn't see his 3-year-old daughter until he returned. After retiring from the Army Air Corps, he worked as a barber in Moundsville for nearly 70 years. He currently lives with his son, Vic Butler, who also served in the military as a Vietnam vet and worked in the Navy. Vic says he looks up to his father. “That's pretty much my goal. I just wanted to be like my dad so at his age right now he'll be 101 on the 23rd this month,” said Vic. “I'm proud of him, proud of the service he's done, the way he lived his life and took care of his family.” Butler also knows that it's rare to see any vet who was drafted at 19. “Well it would be something if I happened to be the oldest one in the county but I don't think that’s going to happen,\" Butler said. He says it's important to support the military more than we do, but ultimately, he is happy to be one of the soldiers who returned home after World War II. “I'm just glad it's over, and I'm glad I’m one of the fortunate ones to get back to my family,'\" Butler said. Butler now enjoys going to church on Sundays with his son.",

    "text": "La presidenta de la Comisión Europea (CE), Ursula von der Leyen, ha asegurado este sábado que Europa sigue un «camino similar de paz, esperanza y valores» comunes al de la ruta jacobea durante siglos, y ha abogado por ayudar a Ucrania y por proteger a los agricultores y pescadores.. Von der Leyen ha hecho estas declaraciones en su intervención en una romería organizada por el PP en el municipio coruñés de O Pino a la que acudieron también el líder de esa formación, Alberto Núñez Feijóo; el presidente de la Xunta de Galicia, Alfonso Rueda, y los principales candidatos del partido a las elecciones europeas del próximo 9 de junio.. Ha subrayado que para «completar la ruta del Camino se necesita valentía, fe y resiliencia», además de «buenos compañeros», y ha pedido votar al PP en los próximos comicios.. En su intervención ante unos 5.000 participantes en la romería, la séptima que organiza el PP en ese pequeño municipio contiguo al de Santiago de Compostela, la dirigente europea ha subrayado que Galicia es «una historia de éxito para Feijóo», que ha gobernado en esa comunidad durante catorce años, y ha felicitado también a Rueda por su victoria de hace tres meses.. Von der Leyen ha destacado que algunos de los valores europeos y del Camino están amenazados, pero ha abogado por mantener la «unión» de los 27 Estados miembros y de los 450 millones de habitantes para reforzar la paz. Ha observado que la población de Ucrania está «luchando por su territorio» y por «nuestra seguridad», y ha considerado que aunque la Unión Europea «no puede estar a la altura del sacrificio de la población» de ese país, tras la invasión militar de Rusia en febrero de 2022 que ha ocupado parte del mismo, «estaremos a su lado tanto tiempo como haga falta». También ha hecho constar Von der Leyen la necesidad de «proteger» sectores como la alimentación y ha afirmado que los agricultores son «los primeros que se levantan pronto por las mañanas para trabajar duro para llevar a la mesa los alimentos de los que disfruta» la población. Por tanto, ha expresado su «respecto y agradecimiento» a su labor. Ha reconocido las dificultades derivadas del aumento de precios de las semillas y abonos, pero ha advertido de que es «inaceptable que vendan por debajo de los costes de producción».",

    "title": "Andre Braugher Gave Us 'House’s Most Underrated Character",
    "text": "The Big Picture\n- Andre Braugher notably had a recurring role on House as Dr. Darryl Nolan.\n- Dr. Nolan's ability to anticipate House's moves made him an expert at handling the titular character in House .\n- The presence of Nolan's character spotlighted Dr. Gregory House's struggles with self-destruction, showcasing his reluctance to truly get better.\nDuring its eight-season run,\nHouse delved into puzzling medical cases with a side dish of ethical dilemmas. But perhaps one of its best features was the uncanny ability to explore the complexities of the human condition. The titular character himself was a fascinating and layered character that brought out the best or worst in people (mostly the latter). His larger-than-life presence drove the plot with his crankiness, pure genius, and wittiness for days.\nLet’s just say that there’s one character that enriched the show in more ways than one, but he was as underrated as they come —\nAndre Braugher’s Dr. Darryl Nolan. As Dr. Gregory House’s ( Hugh Laurie) psychiatrist, he had the Herculean task of trying to help the brash doctor deal with his many, many issues. The show’s sixth season introduced Nolan during House’s stint as a patient at the Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. It’s safe to say that anyone (besides Cuddy or Wilson) who could put up with House’s antics without throwing him out on the street qualifies as a saint. If that alone doesn’t make him an impressive character, we don’t know what does.\nHouse\nUsing a crack team of doctors and his wits, an antisocial maverick doctor specializing in diagnostic medicine does whatever it takes to solve puzzling cases that come his way.\n- Release Date\n- November 16, 2004\n- Creator\n- David Shore\n- Cast\n(/tag/hugh-laurie/), [Omar Epps](/tag/omar-epps/), Robert Sean Leonard , Jesse Spencer , Peter Jacobson , Odette Annable , [Charlyne Yi](/tag/charlyne-yi/)\n- Main Genre\n- Drama\n- Seasons\n- 8\n- Studio\n- Fox\nDr. Darryl Nolan Was Always One Step Ahead of House\nOne of the many advantages of House’s inquisitive, truth-seeking, and unbiased view of the world is that he saw the parts of people they wanted so desperately to hide. For the most part, it was this ability that fueled his manipulative nature. People like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard),\nCuddy (Lisa Edelstein), and, let’s not forget, Foreman (Omar Epps) were often on the receiving end of his antics. But it’s safe to say that he met his match in Darryl Nolan, who saw his actions coming from a mile away.\nIn the early parts of Season 6, Episode 1, House had finally weaned himself off the Vicodin and deemed himself ready to go home. However, Nolan was quick to point out that the addiction was only one part of his problem, so before he could sign off on having his medical license reinstated, he needed to work on the other parts. Who hates being told what to do more than anything? If you guessed House, then you guessed right. Naturally, he rebelled, by trying to rile up his fellow patients, called Wilson to help him dig up dirt on the good doctor, and even feigned progress while pretending to take his meds. It was almost cathartic seeing Nolan thwart every one of House’s plans, because let’s face it, practically always getting what he wanted left him with an inflated ego and an unwillingness to change.\n[ ](/house-medically-accurate-episode/)\n\"It's almost... poetic.\"\n[ The Most Medically Accurate ‘House’ Episode Diagnoses a Rare Disease ](/house-medically-accurate-episode/)\nAdmittedly, one of his best qualities was how he didn’t antagonize House when he uncovered each one of his ploys. He let the cat-and-mouse facade go on because that was what ultimately appealed to his difficult patient. Sure, he lost his cool when one of House’s antics ended with Steve (Derek Richardson) AKA Freedom Master getting brutally hurt. But, who wouldn’t? Still, after that, he accepted to help House, because on some level he understood that reaching rock bottom was the only way people like him eventually agreed to get help. If you consider how often people ended up bending to House’s will for peace's sake, this qualifies Nolan as a worthy contender. The two eventually become unlikely friends, and it's not hard to see why.\nNolan Had All House’s “Superpowers” but Used Them for Good\nIt has already been established that Braugher’s character could anticipate House’s moves in a way that can only be described as expert. Do we cop it up to him being a great psychiatrist with years of dealing with difficult patients? Definitely, but it could also be argued that he knew exactly what to do because he was a lot like House. That quality on its own made it easier for him to cut through the clutter and address issues head-on. There’s their little exchange in Season 6, episode 21 where House asks “Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?\" and Nolan replies, \"Nowhere is that in the manual.”\nIt just goes to show that he’s just as direct and, dare we say, brash as House when it comes to delivering treatment. He never coddled him or enabled him which is ultimately the only way to handle someone with as big an ego as the diagnostician. However, judging by the few glimpses we caught of his interactions with other patients, staff, and patrons, it was clear that Nolan came with a filter. He didn’t cling to his brashness like some sort of armor, rather he used it as a tool to connect with patients. On the other hand, House was more often than not plain rude to his patients, colleagues, superiors, and even his friends. Sure, his bedside manner (or lack thereof) often helped him prove that “\neverybody lies” or simply rip off a bandaid. But, in some cases, it was unnecessary and left people physically healthy but emotionally scarred.\nDr. Darryl Nolan’s Character Reinforced That House Was a Lost Cause\nTo anyone with eyes, ears, and a dash of empathy, it was clear that House was in dire need of help — and by help, we mean therapy. He had deep-seated issues and\nhis Vicodin addiction was the least of them. However, it’s clear that while he often pursued other people’s “truths” with vehemence, he was ready to lie to himself about his predicament. From the start, he didn’t believe he had a problem with pills because his mind remained sharp. Once it began to crumble, and he was plagued with visions of Amber (Anne Dudek), among other hallucinations, he checked himself into rehab. Even after his life-altering experience there, he never truly gave in to the fact that a few structured conversations here and there could make him better.\nSo, at the end of the day, Nolan’s character helped viewers realize that House and self-destruction walked hand in hand. Their relationship reinforced the fact that House didn’t have the patience or fortitude to actually get better. So, when he finally quit therapy, there was only one person to blame for that outcome, and his name rhymes with “shmouse”. For a guy who chased answers for a living, it was understandably hard to accept that therapy doesn’t provide all the answers, even after two years. Dare we say that he was looking for another quick fix or a shiny little pill that could stop him from feeling so miserable? Based on that, his decision to stop getting help said a lot more about him than it did about Nolan. In a nutshell, Andre Braugher’s Dr. Nolan may possibly be one of the\ncharacters you forgot was on House, but he played a significant role in just a handful of episodes.\nHouse is available to stream on Hulu in the U.S.",

Speaking to reporters following a cabinet meeting in the capital Ankara, Erdoğan said Türkiye welcomes the announcement, with its efforts. He continued by saying that Israel should take the same step and accept the cease-fire and hostage-release proposal. \"I call on all Western actors to put pressure on the Israeli administration [in this regard],\" the president said. \"We spoke on the phone with Ismail Haniyeh, the Political Bureau Chief of Hamas, prior to our Cabinet meeting. During our conversation with Haniyeh, we discussed efforts to end the conflicts and violence in Gaza,\" Erdoğan said on X. He added that they assessed Hamas' acceptance of the cease-fire proposal received through intermediaries. \"In the phone call where I expressed that we find Hamas's decision, influenced by Türkiye's suggestions, positive, we emphasized that Israel also needs to take steps for a permanent cease-fire,\" Erdoğan further said. Erdoğan also called on all parties, particularly Western countries, to exert \"necessary pressure\" on Israel for a cease-fire.",

    "title": "Husband keeps diary to track wife's affection towards him; wife says 'I'm NOT AVOIDANT, YOU'RE NEEDY.' UPDATED 4X | Someecards AITA",
    "text": "When this husband is fed up with his wife, he asks the internet: I (34M) and my wife (43F) have been together for 16 years and married for 7. We have a 4-year-old daughter. After the first few years where my wife was very kind, present, loving, and affectionate, things have changed a lot: I rarely receive kisses from her, let alone hugs or kind words. She doesn’t ask how I am in the morning, let alone say good morning or good night. I am tired of this. I have told her in every possible way that, as a man, I need these expressions of love to feel loved. Her excuse is that she is too stressed because of the child (but these things were happening even before our daughter was born) or that everything depends on my behavior towards her; every time, it always depends only on me. When we argue about this, she says I’m exaggerating. Tired of arguing about this for a year, I have recorded in a diary all her expressions of love over the past month. I know it may seem exaggerated, but believe me, I am exhausted and don’t know how else to show her the lack of love I feel from her. What I don’t understand is that, se%ually, things are fine and we have sex 2-3 times a week, sometimes initiated by her. I am fed up; I don’t feel loved as I would like, and I have lived like this for many years and now I can’t take it anymore. Please don’t get mad at me, everyone needs their own time to understand certain things, and I realized this over the past year. I am a romantic, passionate, and attentive man. Normally, I can give 5-6 hugs a day, kisses, compliments, surprises, and I can talk about anything and discuss things in different ways. However, being treated like this makes me shut down and withdraw because of the lack of reciprocity. I am seriously thinking of divorcing because I don’t feel heard or understood. I don’t see a person who understands and takes action to change the situation. I'm doing 50/50, working, watching the kid, trash, laundry, blah blah blah. The fact is that even before the kid she behaved like that. I don't want my wife to be my mommy and I'm fully capable to live alone and do everything (because I already had) Basically we're running in this circle until some months ago: I don't receive what I ask (affection) and I'm treated poorly so after a long time of patiently waiting for change I stonewall / get offended. We have a fight because of this. She says she has enough of the stone walling and me being offended because it hurts her. We end the fight with me being the one that \"swallows it\" and try to let it go, I try to tell her what is causing this and to take action. Time passes and we're again from the start. Some months ago I read about stonewalling and how bad it is so I ended it but still, it's really hard for me to get through this lack of affection. The problem is that I've been also treated very bad during this fights: yelled at, called names, divorce threatening by her side. I'm hurt on so many levels. The diary is about facts not my emotions, if I receive no hugs for 5 days in a row it's no hugs for 5 days in a row. I tell her I love her, I tell her how beautiful she is, I joke with her, I buy her preferred premium soda when I do groceries, I ask her how she feels when she's ill and I take care of her. But do I feel reciprocated? Nah Even if we have a difficult 4 yo child I mean, we have a lot of relaxed moments where I do kiss her, hug her for some seconds, tell her something nice. It is impossible that she's so stressed that she can't even hold my hand for some seconds. I think that the issue with her is that she comes from a family where the father was really abusive (hitting, calling name, etc) and in constant fight with the mother (cheating). I think that she received love from her mother but she didn't from his father and that's the result. But from the other side I don't understand how she could give me what I needed the first 1/2 years of the relationship... just because it was new? I also asked how her 2 previous relationships were with the partners, if they complained about these things, but she says they didn't and that she was giving them hugs etc (but in this case they were 3/4 years older than her) These days, after publishing the post, I've spent a lot of time reading online, watching reels, watching YouTube videos to better understand my situation, and thanks to one of these, I discovered the issue of Avoidant Attachment Style. I was stunned by how closely my wife fit the description, and I set out to thoroughly study the case. I also identified other things I should do in my relationship: set clear boundaries, demand that my requests are understood, respected, and fulfilled, stand firm in my position, and if necessary, make it clear that I am willing to leave. I showed the Excel sheet to my wife the next day. Her first response was, \"But yesterday we cuddled.\" I told her, \"Look at the facts over the past month, there are things you never do and the few things you do are a result of my complaints or arguments. They’re not debatable, I’m sorry.\" Then I told her what I discovered and how she fits into the case, I read her the main characteristics of these people and the types of traumas they have gone through in their lives. I explained to her (knowing her personal family story) that this was mainly thanks to the abuse she received when she was a kid from her parents. My wife was stunned and listened, then asked me, \"So what should I do to solve this?\" My answer was \"I don't know\" because I really don't know. The thing I do know, and what I told her, is that these problems were generated in her childhood and need to be addressed now. I'm now informing myself about the options available to solve or at least alleviate these issues. Sadly we have difficult schedules so a therapist is now off the table. During the day I cried a lot because finally, after 16 years, I understood why we had these problems. A strong sadness came over me because I recalled all the situations where I was treated badly, with indifference, and did not receive the affection I wanted. I also remembered all the lies and manipulations used over time to cover up her shortcomings. I think the first step is to focus on myself and solve my own problems since I developed an Anxious Attachment Style. I'll probably use an online course and books to do this since I have very little time between my daughter and work. If it works, I will propose it to my wife, who says, \"I understand, don’t worry, now I know what I need to give you without courses or anything,\" but I have serious doubts about this statement and will continue to track what happens in my diary to have objective data. I’ve already told her that if, unfortunately, this situation doesn’t resolve, I will proceed with divorce, and when I do, if forced, I won’t go back. That will be the end. I will let you know what happens. Personally, I want to see how things go next week. I am sure (unless I am mistaken) that my wife will only last three days. In any case, I will continue on my path to heal and be ready for a new relationship when the time comes. Stay tuned. If anyone has experience with a spouse healing from an Avoidant Attachment Style please let me know! So, as expected my wife lasted less than 3 days, actually just 1 (in terms of giving kisses, hugs, cuddling). But it doesn't matter, I found all the things I need to fix in me so I'm starting the journey alone in order to grow and be able, without hesitation, to proceed with a divorce and don't go back to her. I'm also seeing a lawyer to have everything checked before I proceed in the future. The interesting thing is that I listed all my insecurities and issues related to the trauma I experienced in my childhood and I see a lot of thing that I need to work about and to fix in me I asked out of curiosity to my wife what are the top 3 things she things should be fixed (expecting them to be at least 10 items) but she just told me that defensiveness and stonewalling are the only two things and that, without them, I would be a perfect husband. I was stunned and confused the whole day. I also asked her if removing these 2 things would result in her loving me more, but she told me no because she already loves me the way I am and this is just my cross... So it seems she's happy with the marriage while I'm not. I want more from a relationship, at least the basic caring of a wife I don't think I'll give you any other update because I'll be focused improving things in myself, but once the times come for me to proceed with the divorce, I'll let you know what happens Thanks for sharing your story. While I'm trying to start my healing process I'm literally crying every day preparing myself for divorce. The probability of her change is less than 1% and the issues we have are deep rooted in the past. I tried everything to get her attention, I gave her all the love I could possibly give, I tried so many times to accomodate to her way of being but I have enough. I'm heart broken. My dear wife, my dear lovely wife, my first woman in my life. I did everything I could to love her with all my heart and be recognised for this, loved for this. Every small bid for attention is lost in the dark. I'm really heart broken, I'm just preparing myself for the divorce, trying to cry out all the tears before I finally tell her I'm leaving. It's one of the most difficult things to do in my life, and believe me, I did crazy and difficult things in the past. This one is probably going to kill me but I need to proceed. I can't live like that any longer and I don't want my child to see and become like this because the chances for her to find a good partner will lower considerably... Yes I tried to be affectionate for a couple of years, also during covid, but man, it was hell. Me just working, playing video games till 1/2 in the morning, sometimes watch a movie with her where she always fell asleep... no real connection. Just me doing something and she on her phone... I remember one time one friend of ours saying that he was about to disconnect from the game because he was \"requested\" by his girlfriend that wanted to stay with him and watch something together... I tried this but it feels to me like I'm always missing something, I don't have that deep connection, I'm alone, and feel alone. Then, when we have arguments, I have no love bank filled to be able to face that (you know sort of: ok you're mean to me but 3 hours ago you were kissing me telling me I love you), I have only negative feelings. Also this way of being it's not me. I want to feel wanted. I want to be cuddled. I need love. If I'm feeling bad I want someone being able to hug me and tell me \"sweetheart don't worry, everything is going to be all right\". She never does this, instead says things like \"level up\" \"life is hard blah blah blah\". I know that it's her traumas and I don't have any resentment towards her. I just can't keep up with this. Also I love to give love, stopping from doing this is devastating. I also have other issues like she almost never initiate any discussion, doesn't allocate time for me, it's always me chasing her and I have enough of it. Se% can't be our only way of connection. She's always with me but her mind is somewhere else. I tried to enter in her mind, but no luck in 16 years. It's been a full year that I'm talking about this issue with my wife. And she frequently denied it by saying things like \"it's not true\" \"tomorrow I'll show you\" \"this very morning I gave you a kiss, I'm affectionate\", \"see other couples they don't engage any more after all these years\", blah blah blah. How would you feel after 1 full year of sweet attempts to talk about an issue? And frequently she would say that her lack of affection is due to me doing x y z. I'd to create the spreadsheet to have EVIDENCE of an issue. And the evidence shows that the affection I receive it's only when I have a fight with her or I complain the day before. 1 day of change followed by weeks of nothing. It bothered her and she was angry, sure, I get the frustration of seeing something like that, but does she get my 1 year frustration? And I'm not threatening divorce over a spreadsheet, I'm threatening over 1 year of trying to talk and solve the issue. I could've said just \"I'm done, bye bye\" 1 year ago, I rather fought with everything that came to my mind Yeah, so I created a spreadsheet after months, months, of no affection. So you could create a spreadsheet with 0 in every cell for 90 days. You don't know what you're talking about and surely you don't know what it feels like to receive no affection in a marriage for so long. Do I have personal issues and traumas? Yes Sir, and I'm going to address them. Does my wife have issues and traumas? Yes Sir, but is she going to do something about it? Nope (at least this will be the most probable scenario). So hence the divorce so she can provide her careless to whoever she wants to",
