    "title": "Opositores de Maduro: os expatriados em sua própria pátria",
    "text": "Seis opositores venezuelanos vivem sob confinamento forçado na Embaixada da Argentina em Caracas. Esses dissidentes, que sabem muito bem o peso brutal do regime de Nicolás Maduro , estão cada vez mais esquecidos no limbo diplomático em um país onde a Justiça e as demais instituições de Estado faliram. No último dia 20, eles completaram sete meses como expatriados em sua própria pátria. Eles são membros da equipe da líder opositora Maria Corina Machado e entraram na mira do regime de Maduro sob a acusação de terrorismo, ações violentas e desestabilização do país. “Crimes” que são recorrentemente atribuídos aos opositores na Venezuela. Um receituário típico de todo e qualquer regime híbrido ou ditatorial para enjaular seus críticos.\nApesar de estarem na Venezuela, legal e formalmente eles não estão. Até agosto, estiveram por meses sob a proteção da Argentina, como se lá estivessem. Desde agosto estão sob a proteção do Brasil, que assumiu a custódia da embaixada argentina.\nMas Maduro, que não se importa com regras e leis, jamais concedeu um salvo-conduto para que eles saíssem do país. E por que isso? Mais que um cárcere velado é um cativeiro.\nAo sequestrar seis pessoas muito caras à sua principal oponente dentro da Venezuela, Maduro impôs uma mordaça na oposição\nPode parecer absurdo pensar que a ditadura venezuelana pinçaria seis auxiliares de Machado para ameaçar seus opositores, sabendo que todos os dias ele tem enviado inocentes para a prisão, submetidos à tortura e uma série de outras sevícias. Mas o regime enxergou nessas pessoas, que fazem parte do núcleo político de Maria Corina Machado, um ponto nevrálgico.\nNão são poucos os sinais que Maduro tem emitido. Desde o início do asilo, em março, a embaixada Argentina esteve sob cerco policial, a energia foi cortada diversas vezes e o regime parecia que rasgaria os tratados internacionais e invadiria a representação para prender os “terroristas”\nNos primeiros meses em que os dissidentes estiveram sob a guarda dos argentinos, os brutamontes que o regime escalou para assediar e amedrontar seus reféns. Depois que o embaixador argentino foi expulso e a guarda da representação passou para a responsabilidade do Brasil, nada mudou.\nMaduro chegou a reverter a permissão, impôs regra de silêncio e não deixou de intimidar. De tempos em tempos, simula invasões e mantém a edificação às escuras. O governo brasileiro foi arrastado para o epicentro de uma equação delicada, onde a diplomacia e os interesses políticos internos e regionais colidem com a sobrevivência física e política desses asilados.\nEssa situação se tornou ainda mais instável quando Maduro e o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva passaram a encenar desentendimentos. Devido às pressões internas e externas que pesam sobre seu governo por seu histórico de tolerância com a ditadura de Maduro, Lula tem aceitado cada vez mais a transição do papel de moderador a crítico de Maduro.\nPessoas familiarizadas com o tema dizem que de fato Maduro e Lula não têm a mesma relação de fraternidade que o brasileiro tinha com Chávez ou tem com outros autocratas. Mas, apesar de mais fria, nunca deixou de ser uma relação boa. Portanto, as tensões podem ter um uso duplo. Poupar Lula do desgaste de lidar com a Venezuela ao mesmo tempo que poupa Maduro de ter que recuar para ajudar Lula.\nCaso isso esteja correto, Maduro pode retroceder na concessão de autorizações de tutela do Brasil sobre a embaixada argentina e isso resultaria em quadro crítico para os asilados que nela se encontram. Um movimento que eximiria o Brasil de toda e qualquer responsabilidade.\nA questão, entretanto, não seria mais se, mas quando Maduro viraria a mesa. As tensões em Caracas têm aumentado, e a imprevisibilidade do regime é um fator constante de instabilidade. Mesmo que, até o momento, Maduro tenha respeitado os limites da imunidade diplomática, não há garantias de que essa postura será mantida indefinidamente. Em um cenário de escalada de conflitos internos, ou em um momento de necessidade de reafirmação de poder, Maduro pode muito bem decidir romper com as convenções internacionais e invadir a embaixada. Ele pode tudo.\nA coisa se agrava quando se atribui ao Brasil o veto à entrada da Venezuela nos Brics. Ao mesmo tempo em que Lula precisa se descolar de Maduro para aliviar a pressão interna. Maduro precisa descolar de Lula para chutar o balde em vários aspectos que elevarão o grau de repressão de seu regime. Uma violação da Embaixada da Argentina não estaria fora de cogitação. Queira Deus que eu esteja errado. Queira Deus que o governo Lula não esteja colaborando com isso.\nLula pode com um simples telefonema reverter a situação. Todos que ele pode e já poderia ter colocado um ponto final na crise dos asilados. Não seria a hora de fazê-lo já?\nVeja Também: No metaverso chavista, Lula virou agente da CIA O Foro de São Paulo nunca decepciona Crise na Venezuela: Lula não é o cara Conteúdo editado por: Aline Menezes",

    "title": "Landscaping: Right time, right tree, right installation",
    "text": "With fall come the declining temperatures, shorter daylight periods and (finally!) moisture in the soil. These conditions signal that it’s nearly tree planting season here in the Midsouth. Though trees can be successfully installed all year-round, mid-October through winter dormancy is the very best time. Why so?\nEntering and during dormancy, plants are generally under less stress to conduct water, build cells and fight pests. So, a relocation — even of a tree container-grown tree — is generally less stressful in cooler months. More importantly, the majority of landscape-sized trees (let’s say two- to fourth-inch caliper trunks) are not container-grown but, rather, are machine-harvested from nursery fields.\nThe best growers in-field root pruning but even with good cultivation practices, the transplanting process doesn’t capture the entire of a tree’s root mass in those truncated earth balls you see wrapped in burlap and secured with wire baskets. So, a transplant has suffered root loss plus the traumas of excavation, handling and re-installation. These invasions are less impactful if trees are, otherwise, under reduced environmental stress.\nAnd so, if the past few weeks of heat and drought have you thinking more shade is a good idea, if you’d like to create a visual screen, or maybe you’re looking for habitat or aesthetic interest, it’s go time! Start with a professional landscape designer or architect who can recommend the right trees in the right places.\nSomeone who not only knows plant material and how to evaluate site conditions, but also understands scale and space and listens to your ideas and thoughts, as well. A good design will take into account soil types, moisture conditions, drainage and utility easements, tree compatibilities and more. Don’t forget to consider natives like oak, maple, hickory, black gum, dogwood and serviceberry as first choices.\nLastly, the right installation is critical. Those of us who have spent a great amount of time in the industry have found that people — not pests, disease or weather — are responsible for most transplant failure of healthy trees. The most frequent mistakes I see landscapers make include planting at improper grade and over-mulching. Ideally for most trees, top of the earth ball should be set approximately two inches above the surrounding finished grade.\nThis setting properly positions the root flare (the large structural roots extending from the trunk) and allows for two to three inches of an organic mulch placement. It’s common to see failing or weak trees that were installed too deeply — depriving the roots of oxygen — and mulched in a “volcano” form which creates wet bark and the opportunity for pathogens and insects to compromise plant health.\nThere’s always more to say than there is space. And, as always, Holly Consults is happy to help in the design and implementation of your next project!",

    "text": "Venti di guerra tra Israele e Iran. Alcuni funzionari americani sono stati informati del fatto che Israele sarebbe pronto a lanciare un'operazione contro Teheran. Lo riporta CbsNews citando diverse fonti. Secondo l'emittente inoltre, gli Usa temono che l'Iran possa effettuare ritorsioni su alcuni siti americani nel vicino Iraq, e proprio per questa ragione a diversi cittadini americani ieri è stato consigliato di lasciare la regione: il Dipartimento di Stato ha ordinato ai funzionari governativi non in situazioni di emergenza di lasciare l'Iraq a causa delle \"accresciute tensioni regionali\", e il Pentagono ha autorizzato i familiari dei militari ad abbandonare volontariamente le proprie sedi in tutto il Medio Oriente, ha dichiarato un funzionario della Difesa a CbsNews.\nAnche Donald Trump si è soffermato sull'argomento. Intervenendo al Kennedy Center il presidente ha dichiarato che gli Stati Uniti stanno spostando il personale americano in Medio Oriente a causa di un possibile \"pericolo\" nella regione. \"Vengono spostati perché potrebbe diventare un posto pericoloso\". La situazione di pericolo imminente, dunque, è confermata.\nTrump ha ammesso di essere \"sempre meno fiducioso che Teheran possa accettare di rinunciare all’arricchimento dell’uranio\".\nDa parte sua l'Iran ha rilanciato le difese: \"Se le trattative dovessero fallire e venissimo attaccati - ha detto il ministro della Difesa Aziz Nasirzadeh - colpiremo le basi americane in Medio Oriente\".\n- articolo in aggiornamento -\nnetiquette.\nQuile norme di comportamento per esteso.",

    "title": "Conselhos nacionais de Saúde e de Direitos Humanos denunciam Bolsonaro por crimes cometidos na pandemia",
    "text": "A conduta do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PL) e dos então ministros Eduardo Pazuello, Marcelo Queiroga e Walter Braga Neto durante a pandemia de Covid-19 são alvo de uma representação do Conselho Nacional de Saúde (CNS) e do Conselho Nacional de Direitos Humanos (CNDH) apresentada nesta quinta-feira (24) junto a Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR). Conforme a representação, os envolvidos teriam praticado crimes contra a saúde e a paz públicas. O objetivo é que seja oferecida denúncia ao Supremo Tribunal Federal. Na gestão anterior da PGR, foram protocoladas dez petições criminais em decorrência do relatório final da CPI da Pandemia. Destas, nove foram arquivadas e uma está sob sigilo. Também há três inquéritos criminais em trâmite no STF, relacionados a crimes cometidos por autoridades no contexto da pandemia, mas a PGR pediu o arquivamento dos dois inquéritos que investigavam Jair Bolsonaro. Não tramita nenhuma iniciativa de responsabilização criminal do ex-presidente pelos crimes cometidos durante a emergência sanitária no Brasil. O primeiro crime apontado pela representação atual trata da infração de medidas sanitárias estabelecidas na época por prefeituras e governos estaduais. A CPI da Pandemia elaborou uma lista de 26 oportunidades em que Bolsonaro e membros de seu governo desobedeceram determinações que visavam conter a proliferação do vírus. Em março de 2021, por exemplo, o então presidente comemorou seu aniversário com apoiadores aglomerados, diante do Palácio da Alvorada, sem fazer uso de máscara. Da mesma forma, Bolsonaro também teria cometido o crime previsto no art. 267 do Código Penal: “causar epidemia, mediante a propagação de germes patogênicos”. Além de organizar e fomentar aglomerações, o ex-presidente chegou a defender, sem evidências científicas, a medida de imunidade de rebanho por contágio. A recomendação de medicamentos ineficazes como política pública foi outra conduta recorrente do governo na época. Uma petição criminal da mesma natureza havia sido arquivada pela antiga gestão da PGR, alegando que o crime de epidemia é cometido apenas quando alguém transmite “pessoalmente” o vírus a outra pessoa. A representação dos conselhos, por outro lado, aponta que o crime é qualificado pelo resultado de morte. No contexto da CPI da Pandemia, o epidemiologista Pedro Hallal demonstrou que aproximadamente 400 mil mortes em decorrência da Covid-19 poderiam ter sido evitadas e que, dentre essas, 145 mil mortes decorreram diretamente da demora na aquisição da vacina por parte das autoridades. O documento elenca ainda o crime de charlatanismo, presente no art. 283 do Código Penal, cometido por Bolsonaro e pelo ministro Pazuello ao promover o uso de medicamentos sem eficácia comprovada contra o vírus. Em maio de 2020, o Ministério da Saúde divulgou o primeiro protocolo para uso de hidroxicloroquina como “tratamento precoce”. Outro ponto relatado na representação é que a estratégia de defesa de Jair Bolsonaro confunde a adoção de medidas de contenção da doença e de medidas de resposta ao espalhamento do vírus. Em dados momentos, membros do governo federal admitem ter contribuído para a propagação da doença com a finalidade de alcançar a suposta imunidade de rebanho e, ao mesmo tempo, proteger a economia. Em outras oportunidades, Bolsonaro nega o propósito de espalhar a doença e usa como justificativa as medidas de assistência a pessoas já adoecidas, além de medidas que não dizem respeito à prevenção da doença. O crime de perigo para a vida ou saúde de outrem, previsto no art. 132 do Código Penal, também pode enquadrar diversas condutas dos representados. Conforme o documento, qualquer prática contrária às evidências científicas que visavam a contenção do vírus foi capaz de configurar risco real de perigo à vida e à saúde da população. Além de promover o desrespeito às medidas preventivas contra a Covid-19, Jair Bolsonaro também incentivou a invasão de hospitais e a filmagem de leitos durante a pandemia. De acordo com a representação, essa conduta comprometeu a segurança e a tranquilidade, bens jurídicos protegidos pela legislação. No Código Penal, o art. 286 prevê o crime de incitação ao crime. O delito é cometido por quem atua de modo a influenciar terceiros, de forma pública, “fazendo surgir um propósito criminoso que antes era inexistente ou ainda reforçando um propósito que já existia”. Eleito por 57,8 milhões de brasileiros, Jair Bolsonaro detinha grande número de apoiadores e suas falas repercutiam nacionalmente, tanto nos veículos de imprensa quanto nas redes sociais do presidente.",

    "text": "Le\nproteine sono macronutrienti essenziali per la salute e il benessere del nostro organismo. Svolgono un ruolo fondamentale nella costruzione e riparazione dei tessuti, nella produzione di enzimi e ormoni, e nel mantenimento di un sistema immunitario forte.\nSe le proteine fanno bene, significa che più proteine è sempre meglio?\nMa quante proteine ci servono davvero? Quante ci bastano?\nFabbisogno proteico giornaliero\nL’Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità (OMS)\nraccomanda un apporto proteico giornaliero di 0,8 grammi per chilogrammo di peso corporeo per gli adulti sani, ciò significa che una persona di 70 kg dovrebbe consumare circa 56 grammi di proteine al giorno.\nLe\nindicazioni italiane (LARN) prevedono\n- Fabbisogno medio: 0.7 g per chilogrammo di peso (Es: adulto di 70 kg, 49 g al giorno)\n- Assunzione raccomandata: 0.9 g per chilogrammi di peso (Es: adulto di 70 kg, 63 g al giorno)\nTuttavia questi sono solo, rispettivamente, il requisito minimo per prevenire la carenza proteica e l’apporto consigliato a livello di popolazione, valori che non tengono conto delle differenze individuali o delle esigenze specifiche di alcuni soggetti.\nFattori che influenzano il fabbisogno proteico\n- Età: I neonati, i bambini in crescita e gli anziani possono richiedere un apporto proteico leggermente superiore per supportare la crescita, lo sviluppo e il mantenimento della massa muscolare.\n- Attività fisica: Gli individui che svolgono regolarmente\nattività fisicaintensa o gli atleti possono beneficiare di un apporto proteico più elevato, fino a 1,2-2,0 grammi per chilogrammo di peso corporeo (valori per allenamenti amatoriali, possono essere più elevati per alcuni sport e allenamenti intesi), per favorire il recupero muscolare e l’adattamento all’allenamento.\n- Gravidanza e allattamento: Le donne in gravidanza e durante l’\nallattamentorichiedono un maggiore apporto proteico per supportare la crescita del feto e la produzione di latte materno.\n- Condizioni mediche: Alcune condizioni mediche, come le ferite, le\nustionio certe malattie, possono aumentare il fabbisogno proteico per favorire la guarigione e il recupero.\nMiti comuni sull’assunzione di proteine\n- Più proteine sono sempre meglio: Consumare proteine in eccesso non porta benefici aggiuntivi e può anzi causare problemi di salute, come affaticamento dei reni e perdita di calcio nelle ossa. Per approfondire:\nTroppe proteine fanno male? Sì, ma non tutte\n- Le proteine animali sono superiori a quelle vegetali: Sebbene le proteine animali siano complete, è possibile ottenere tutti gli aminoacidi essenziali combinando diverse fonti proteiche vegetali. Per approfondire:\nIl valore biologico delle proteine\n- Le proteine NON fanno ingrassare: Le proteine stesse non fanno ingrassare, ma un eccesso di calorie totali, indipendentemente dalla fonte, può portare all’aumento di peso. Per approfondire:\nLe proteine fanno ingrassare?\nI prodotti proteici fanno bene?\nI prodotti con proteine aggiunte, come barrette proteiche, polveri proteiche e alcuni alimenti fortificati, possono avere sia vantaggi che svantaggi. Ecco una panoramica equilibrata:\nPotenziali benefici:\n- Convenienza e praticità: I prodotti con proteine aggiunte possono essere comodi per le persone con uno stile di vita frenetico che hanno difficoltà a consumare pasti completi e bilanciati, ma quando possibile è sempre meglio ottenere la maggior parte delle proteine da fonti alimentari naturali e ricorrere ai prodotti con proteine aggiunte solo come integrazione occasionale quando necessario.\n- Aumento dell’apporto proteico: Per coloro che hanno difficoltà a soddisfare il proprio fabbisogno proteico attraverso la dieta, i prodotti con proteine aggiunte possono aiutare a colmare le lacune.\nPotenziali svantaggi:\n- Qualità delle proteine: Alcuni prodotti con proteine aggiunte possono contenere proteine di bassa qualità o incomplete, che non forniscono tutti gli aminoacidi essenziali necessari.\n- Ingredienti aggiuntivi: Molti prodotti con proteine aggiunte contengono anche zuccheri aggiunti, grassi saturi e additivi artificiali, che possono avere effetti negativi sulla salute se consumati in eccesso. Per approfondire:\nPerché gli alimenti ultraprocessati fanno male?\n- Costo: I prodotti con proteine aggiunte sono spesso più costosi rispetto alle fonti proteiche naturali come carne magra, pesce,\nuovae legumi.",

    "title": "Study: Chemical abortions often more painful than women expect",
    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // Women who undergo chemical abortions often say they were unprepared by healthcare providers for how painful the procedure can be, a new study suggests.\nNBC News reported on a study of roughly 1,600 women in the United Kingdom published Dec. 17 by the journal BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health.\nA press release regarding the study said researchers surveyed women who had obtained chemical abortions sometime in their pregnancies up to 10 weeks in late 2021 or early 2022. The researchers asked women about their pain levels during the chemical abortion and what they wish they would have been told to expect.\nAccording to the release, the women were reportedly told by their abortion providers that the pain they would experience while undergoing a chemical abortion would be similar to that of strong menstrual cramps.\n“While some respondents felt that was an accurate description, others said they felt unprepared and that the pain aspect of medication abortion was ‘sugar-coated’ or downplayed,” NBC News reported.\nTaking abortion chemical pills blocks progesterone, a hormone necessary for a stable pregnancy, and later causes a woman’s uterus to cramp and expel the aborted baby.\nThe release said roughly half of the women reported the pain they experienced during the abortion was worse than they had expected. Over 90% of the overall sample rated their pain as at least a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. Around 40% of the total respondents ranked their pain as “severe,” rating it between 8 and 10 out of 10.\n“One woman who responded to the survey said: ‘Pain was so much stronger than period pain, it was like having contractions in labour. I’ve given birth three times and the pain really wasn’t too much different from that pain, the cramping contraction pain,’” NBC News reported.\nAccording to the study, as NBC News reported, women who had previously experienced labor and birth, or women who have extreme menstrual cramps, were less likely to report severe pain.\nThe study abstract stated that women reportedly said they wished they were better prepared by a clear understanding of the pain levels associated with the abortion. They also recommended that women have access to other women’s first-hand experiences with chemical abortion.\nAccording to the release, one respondent commented: “[Being transparent] might put some women off from abortion, however, I feel that patients have a right to fully understand the risks and benefits. This should be made absolutely transparent; shared and informed decision making is essential.”\n>>UK pro-life group urges ban on mailed abortion pills after\nman is convicted of poisoning pregnant woman<<\nOther health experts and researchers also say that women should be more informed about the pain involved with the abortion.\n“Patients need to be adequately informed about what to expect and be told what we know about how to manage the pain,” Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology who was not one of the researchers who conducted the study, said in the NBC News report.\nHe added that pain is often “downplayed” in healthcare, especially in the fields of women’s health and obstetrics and gynecology.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

This Thursday, Israeli forces bombed cities and refugee camps from the north to the south of the Gaza Strip and killed dozens of Palestinians, with Israel determined to redouble an almost three-month offensive against the Islamist Hamas movement that has expanded to almost the entire territory and displaced several thousand civilians, amid new UN warnings over the humanitarian crisis in the enclave. The conflict has already left more than 21,000 Palestinians dead and expelled about 85% of the 2.3 million inhabitants of their homes from their homes. Gaza. Much of the north of the territory was devastated by aerial bombardments and urban fighting, and has been largely depopulated and isolated from the rest for weeks.

Time for a humanitarian [#ceasefire] [@UNRWA] [pic.twitter.com/sC9lhYRjq7] — Thomas White (@TomWhiteGaza) [December 26, 2023] Israel said this week that will expand its combined air and ground offensive to a third sector, the center of the Gaza Stripafter attacking refugee camps there by air and bringing troops and tanks closer to them, after opening a second front of combat in the southern city of Khan Yunis at the beginning of December. In the umpteenth international warning about the situation in Gaza, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said this Thursday that civilians in the region “They are dealing with catastrophic hunger.” due to the lack of food as a result of Israel closing all its borders. “Every day is a fight for survival, to find food and water,” he said. Thomas White, UNRWA Gaza Affairs Directoron social network X, and added that “40% of the population is already at risk of suffering from famine.” Israel has promised to dismantle Hamas to prevent it from launching attacks again like those on October 7, when militants from the group infiltrated from Gaza killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 240, including about twenty Argentines. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuhas rejected international calls for a ceasefire, believing this would be a “gift” to Hamas and instead vowed to intensify the offensive until the group is destroyed and the hostages still held captive are recovered. after 105 were released last month during a truce.

[pic.twitter.com/NkDwAsgQZy] — United Nations (@ONU_es) [December 22, 2023] The United States provided crucial political and military support on the offensive and, although he has also urged Israel to reduce civilian casualties and allow more aid into Gaza, the situation on the ground has not changed much, even after the UN Security Council passed a resolution who asked for the same thing last week.

The plan in question was presented last week to the leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which is also involved in the fighting against Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip, during visits to Cairo by the leaders of both movements. In Gaza, meanwhile, an Israeli bombardment killed more than 30 people when it hit a square and surrounding houses in Beit Lahiya this Thursday.a city in the northern Strip that was one of the first targets of the ground offensive, in late October, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported, citing medical sources. Two journalists were among the dead, the Hamas Government Press Office in Gaza said, adding that this brought to 105 the number of press workers who lost their lives in the offensive. In central Gaza, Israeli warplanes and artillery bombed the Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps and leveled buildings, residents told Wafa. The agency said at least seven Palestinians were killed in an attack in Nuseirat. Photo: AFP Israel said this week it would expand its ground offensive into central Gaza and ordered the evacuation of an area there, which includes the Bureij camp, where tens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing from the north are taking refuge. Israel, which has asked civilians in that area to go to the nearby city of Deir el-Balah, typically launches airstrikes before troops and tanks arrive. Hamas said this week that it attacked an Israeli tank east of Bureij. Also there were airstrikes in Khan Yuniswhere at least one Palestinian was killed and several others were injured in the southeast of the city, Qatari television station Al Jazeera reported. It’s a statement, The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 50 Palestinians were killed on Thursday and dozens were injured. in Israeli morning attacks in Beit Lahiya, Khan Yunis and the Al Maghazi refugee camp, which is also in central Gaza, near Bureij and Deir el-Balah. The Israeli Army blames the high number of civilian deaths on Hamas, which positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas Israel’s offensive in Gaza is already one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. At least 21,320 Palestinians, most of them women and children, died in Israeli bombings or fighting in Gaza, including 220 in the last 24 hours, while another 55,603 were injured, the local Ministry of Health indicated today. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The Israeli Army claims it has killed thousands of Hamas militants and that 167 of its soldiers have died in the ground offensive. The conflict spread across the Middle East, with hundreds of attacks against US and Israeli targets in or from Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen by militias supported by Iran, which is an enemy of Israel and the United States. In Syria, pro-Iran militias attacked two United States military bases in the east of the country on Thursday, the NGO Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported, without giving immediate details about victims or material damage. Photo: AFP In the West Bank, the other Palestinian territories, which are separated from Gaza by the Israeli State and occupied and colonized by Israel, more than 300 Palestinians have died in attacks by the Army or Israeli settlers since October 7. The highest authority of the UN on human rights, Volker Türk, asked Israel this Thursday “end illegal killings” of Palestinians in the West Bank, in a report that denounces a rapid deterioration of the situation in the region. Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, denounced “the use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary and disproportionate force and the application of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions affecting Palestinians” in the West Bank. “The intensity of the violence and repression has not been seen for years,” he added.

The plan received a cold reception from both sidesbut none rejected it outright. The head of Egypt’s State Information Service, Dia Rashuan, said Thursday that the proposal was drawn up from the “points of view” of the parties involved, but that he had not yet received a response from them. #Israel #killed #dozens #Palestinians #Gaza #including #depopulated #north",

    "text": "Como ya se anunció hace unas semanas, CCOO, CSIF y CIG finalmente [ han salido a la calle este viernes, 13 de septiembre](https://noticiastrabajo.huffingtonpost.es/empleo/los-trabajadores-de-la-seguridad-social-tienen-fecha-para-nuevas-movilizaciones/), para protestar por la falta de personal en la Seguridad Social. Una situación que está provocando retrasos en la administración con los ciudadanos. Y es que, actualmente, hay 5.000 vacantes libres que cubrir dentro de esta administración pública entre personal funcionario y personal laboral. Entre las denuncias de los sindicatos está el incremento de las cargas de trabajo al actual personal de la Seguridad Social. Algo que provoca dificultades “por las constantes modificaciones normativas y de gestión”. Las reivindicaciones de los sindicatos en las protestas de la Seguridad Social Como ha apuntado el representante de CSIF para la Seguridad Social, Paco Riesgo, la concentración se ha caracterizado por la necesidad de cubrir esos puestos, de los que alrededor de 4.700 estarían destinados a la atención al público. Justamente ese punto débil en la administración actual. “Tenemos escasez de plantilla con una saturación brutal de trabajo. Esto afecta directamente a los ciudadanos, que se merecen y deben tener su derecho a ser perfectamente atendidos. Necesitamos plantillas estables y profesionalizadas”, apunta el líder sindical. Otra de las medidas solicitadas por las organizaciones sindicales consiste en que se tomen medidas prioritarias sobre la organización de recursos de dicho organismo público. Reclaman una nueva ‘Oferta de Empleo Público’ donde se priorice la promoción interna. Al mismo tiempo, exigen la cobertura de las plazas ocupadas de forma provisional cumpliendo con los compromisos de la Unión Europea sobre la reducción de la temporalidad en el sector público hasta un máximo del 8% de la plantilla, junto a la creación de bolsas de trabajo específicas para la Seguridad Social. Teletrabajo voluntario para estos trabajadores Entre las exigencias, también se solicita que se dé la oportunidad de un teletrabajo voluntario de dos días a la semana en todas las Entidades Gestoras y Servicios Comunes, con la posibilidad de ampliarse a tres o más días semanales.
