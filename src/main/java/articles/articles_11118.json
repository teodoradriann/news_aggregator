    "title": "Inspired Brighton survive late drama to dent Tottenham’s top-four hopes",
    "text": "Tottenham Hotspur ’s Premier League revival was halted in emphatic fashion after two Joao Pedro penalties and a stunning strike from Pervis Estupinan helped injury-hit Brighton and Hove Albion record a thumping 4-2 win. Spurs arrived at the Amex Stadium seeking a fourth successive top-flight success to reclaim fourth spot from reigning champions Manchester City. But the north London club were ripped apart as Pedro’s double and Estupinan’s thunderbolt added to Jack Hinshelwood’s opener. Tottenham, who claimed late consolations through substitute Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies, could easily have lost by more as rampant Albion twice hit the woodwork and had a Facundo Buonanotte effort disallowed. Richarlison struck a post for the visitors and was twice denied by the offside flag, while Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg also hit the woodwork late on. Yet, on this evidence, Champions League qualification looks a distant dream for Ange Postecoglou ’s side, who had registered just one point from 15 before their recent upturn in form. Victory lifts Roberto De Zerbi ’s hosts above Newcastle into eighth. Depleted Brighton were missing eight first-team players while their visitors also had a lengthy list of absentees. One-time Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck should have opened the scoring for Albion inside six minutes when he was twice denied by goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, but the Seagulls deservedly edged ahead with 11 minutes on the clock. Tottenham’s porous defence failed to halt Pedro’s mazy waltz across the 18-yard box and his offload was emphatically dispatched into the roof of the net by 18-year-old defender Hinshelwood. Brazilian forward Pedro duly doubled the lead with a spot-kick awarded following VAR intervention. Spurs thought they had escaped when Jan Paul van Hecke’s header from a Pascal Gross corner came back off the right post but replays showed Dejan Kulusevski pulled down Welbeck as he attempted to reach the rebound and Pedro coolly rolled home from 12 yards. Stunned Spurs showed little response and were in danger of falling further behind. James Milner rattled the right post with a superb curling effort before Buonanotte’s clinical finish was flagged offside. The away side almost gifted Brighton a third when Pedro was sent through by a calamitous back-pass from Pedro Porro, only to see his attempted dink pushed wide by Vicario. Postecoglou would undoubtedly have been happy to reach the break only two behind, albeit his side’s predicament nearly improved as Richarlison swept against the outside of the left post in added time. The Brazilian then put the ball in the net having already been ruled offside and then curled wide before again being denied by the flag of assistant referee Darren Cann. Tottenham’s frustration was quickly compounded. Seagulls substitute Estupinan, making his first appearance since November 9 due to injury, did the damage, unleashing a thunderous, dipping effort into the top right corner from around 25 yards following Milner’s short corner. Tormentor-in-chief Pedro rubbed salt into Spurs’ wounds 15 minutes from time by dispatching his second penalty after Evan Ferguson was brought down by Giovani Lo Celso. Veliz’s first goal in English football, after Kulusevski and Son Heung-min capitalised on sloppy Seagulls defending, eased the embarrassment before Davies’ header from a Porro cross increased the anxiety among home fans. But Brighton weathered a frantic nine minutes of added time, during which Hojbjerg hit the base of the right post, to claim the points.",

    "text": "在新能源汽车市场持续升温的背景下，小米汽车再次传来捷报。据最新数据显示，小米汽车在3月份的交付量超过29000台，这已是其连续第六个月交付量突破20000辆大关。然而，尽管交付成绩斐然，但小米汽车的交付进度仍远远落后于锁单量，3月锁单量超过8.5万台，消费者面临较长的等待周期，最长交付周期达49周，即约11个月。\n面对产能挑战，小米汽车并未停下前进的脚步。据悉，小米汽车二期工厂建设进展迅速，预计将于今年6月竣工并投入使用，届时总产能将大幅提升至30万辆。小米集团中国区总裁卢伟冰表示，目前产能提升进展顺利，公司对实现全年350000台的交付目标充满信心。\n在交付量稳步攀升的同时，小米汽车的销售网络也在不断拓展。据小米汽车创始人雷军透露，3月份小米汽车新增了15家门店，截至3月31日，全国65座城市已拥有235家门店，为消费者提供了更加便捷的购车体验。此外，服务网点建设也在稳步推进，全国已有127家服务网点覆盖75座城市，为消费者提供全方位的服务保障。\n进入4月，小米汽车继续加速销售网络布局，计划新增33家门店，并将业务拓展至保定、德州、德阳、汕头、湘潭、柳州和马鞍山等7座新城市。这一举措将进一步扩大小米汽车的市场覆盖范围，提升品牌影响力和市场竞争力。\n在产品布局方面，小米汽车同样动作频频。继首款车型SU7成功上市后，首款纯电SUV车型YU7计划于上半年正式上市，为消费者提供更多元化的选择。此外，增程式混动SUV“昆仑”也在紧锣密鼓的研发当中，预计将在未来一段时间内推向市场。",

    "title": "Florida Republicans present bill banning state sponsors of terrorism from TSA areas after Cuba uproar",
    "text": "Two Florida Republicans\nintroduced legislation aimed at banning states considered to be sponsors of terrorism from accessing TSA areas, following generalized uproar in the state due to a visit from Cuban officials to Miami International Airport.\nConcretely, the bill was introduced by Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Carlos Giménez, with the latter calling the visit by Cuban officials a \"direct slap in the face to the Cuban exile community here in Miami-Dade County.\"\nThe bill seeks to prevent any such visits from taking place again. Giménez, former Miami mayor and chair of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on transportation and maritime security, blamed President Joe Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the visit, saying they \"granted agents of the Castro regime access to our sensitive TSA facilities at Miami International Airport.\"\n\"This pathetic and dangerous decision undermines our national security and puts passengers in serious risk,\" Gimenez Said.\nOn his end, Rubio said that \"we must ensure this administration is not enabling foreign operatives to learn of our aviation security measures aimed at keeping Americans safe.\" The initiative has bipartisan support, including from Democrats Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jared Moskowitz, as well as Republicans Rick Scott and Mario Díaz-Balart.\nBesides Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria are included in the law, although last month the Biden administration removed Cuba from the list of countries considered uncooperative with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\nOfficials from the Caribbean country were granted access by federal agencies to inspect a TSA checkpoint and baggage screening area at the airport in mid-May.\nAs reported by\nAxios, MIA director Ralph Cutie said the federal agencies did not inform him or Mayor Daniella Levine-Cava about the tour, adding that \"as a Cuban American and native Miamian, I'm appalled that this took place.\"\nLevine Cava, on her end, said her office contacted the Department of Homeland Security to get answers and request county involvement in \"any future decisions regarding granting access to MIA facilities to foreign government officials.\"\nShe later added that \"the agencies apologized and committed to changing their protocols to ensure we are informed before any other foreign delegations tour our airport.\"\nThe officials' visit happened during Cuban Independence Day, something that furthered angered Cuban-American members of the Miami Dade County Commission.\nRepublican Commissioner Raquel Regalado said that \"the fact that they did it on the day that they did it just proves that it was done to be hurtful and to make a point and to try to hurt the Cuban community.\"\n© 2024 Latin Times.
