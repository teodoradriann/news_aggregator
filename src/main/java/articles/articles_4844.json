    "text": "What we know about the lawsuit filed by the last survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre SEAN MURPHY June 14, 2024 at 12:50 AM\nAttorneys for the two remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre said Thursday they will petition the Oklahoma Supreme Court for a rehearing in the case seeking reparations for one of the worst single acts of violence against Black people in U.S. history.\nIn an 8-1 decision on Wednesday , the state's highest court upheld a decision made by a district court judge in Tulsa last year to dismiss the case . Although the court wrote that the plaintiff's grievances about the destruction of the Greenwood district, also known as “Black Wall Street,” were legitimate, they did not fall within the scope of the state's public nuisance statute.\nHere are some things to know about the lawsuit that seeks reparations for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\nAttorneys for Viola Fletcher, 110, and Lessie Benningfield Randle, 109, said they intend to file a petition for rehearing with the court, essentially asking the court to consider the case again because they believe it erred in its decision.\n“The destruction of forty-square blocks of property on the night of May 31, 1921, through murder and arson clearly meets the definition of a public nuisance under Oklahoma law,” the attorneys said in a statement. “Faithful application of the law compels the conclusion that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have stated a claim for relief. They are entitled to a trial.”\nIf the plaintiffs were to die, attorney Damario Solomon-Simmons said he believes Oklahoma law would allow the case to continue with the plaintiffs' estates. If the Supreme Court denies the petition, the case is effectively over, although Solomon Simmons said they are “continuing to explore new legal avenues that will hold defendants accountable.”\nIn addition to the petition for rehearing, the attorneys called on the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation into the massacre under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. That law, named for Black teenager from Chicago who was abducted and lynched in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman, allows for the reopening of cold cases of violent crimes against Black people committed before 1970.\nWHAT DOES THE LAWSUIT ALLEGE?\nThe suit was an attempt to force the city of Tulsa and others to make restitution for the destruction of the once-thriving Black district by a white mob. In 1921 — on May 31 and June 1 — the mob, including some people hastily deputized by authorities, looted and burned the district, which was referred to as Black Wall Street.\nAs many as 300 Black people were killed, more than 1,200 homes, businesses, school and churches were destroyed, and thousands of survivors were forced for a time into internment camps overseen by the National Guard. Burned bricks and a fragment of a church basement are about all that remain today of the more than 30-block historically Black district.\nBesides the allegations of a continuing public nuisance, attorneys for the survivors argued that Tulsa appropriated the historic reputation of Black Wall Street “to their own financial and reputational benefit.” They argue that any money the city receives from promoting Greenwood or Black Wall Street, including revenue from the Greenwood Rising History Center, should be placed in a compensation fund for victims and their descendants.\nWHAT ARE THE PLAINTIFFS SEEKING?\nAmong other things, the lawsuit sought a detailed accounting of the property and wealth lost or stolen in the massacre, and the establishment of a Victims Compensation Fund to benefit the survivors and the descendants of those killed, injured or who lost property in the killings — as well as for longtime residents of Greenwood and North Tulsa.\nIt also sought the construction of a hospital in north Tulsa, the creation of a land trust for all vacant and undeveloped land that would be distributed to descendants, and the establishment of a scholarship program for massacre descendants who lived in the Greenwood area.\nThe lawsuit also requested that the descendants of those who were killed, injured or lost property be immune from any taxes, fees, assessments or utility expenses by Tulsa or Tulsa County for the next 100 years.\nShow comments Advertisement\nAdvertisement\nIn Other News Entertainment Entertainment CBS News Dancing Taylor Swift fans cause seismic activity at concert in Scotland Entertainment USA TODAY 'Teen Mom' star Amber Portwood makes plea for missing fiancé: 'Very scared right now' Finance Finance Yahoo Finance Elon Musk wins Tesla shareholder vote for $56 billion pay package Finance Reuters T-Mobile lands multi-year US Navy contract Food Food Food & Wine 5 pro tips for hosting a mystery wine tasting Food Delish These firecracker burgers with strawberry-miso salad are a reality show winner Lighter Side Lighter Side Fox News Carvings on ancient stone discovery leave experts in awe Lighter Side Business Insider 8 of the best scents to wear this summer, according to professional perfumers Sports Sports USA TODAY US Open live updates: Leaderboard, highlights and more from first round Sports Yahoo Sports Rodgers's absence from minicamp isn't even the most concerning holdout for the Jets Weather Weather CBS News Days of rain have flooded parts of South Florida, prompting closures Weather CBS News Taylor Swift's Eras Tour causes seismic activity in Scotland Advertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nRelated articles\nShow comments Advertisement\nAdvertisement\nRelated articles\nShow comments Advertisement\nAdvertisement\nRelated articles\nShow comments Advertisement",

    "text": "Saul “Canelo” Alvarez puts his undisputed super-middleweight crown on the line on Saturday when he faces undefeated Mexican compatriot Jaime Munguia in Las Vegas. Alvarez, 33, will be chasing the 61st victory of his dazzling career when he takes on Munguia at the T-Mobile Arena in a bout scheduled to coincide with Mexico’s “Cinco de Mayo” festivities. The 27-year-old Munguia starts as a heavy underdog against his more illustrious countryman despite compiling an impressive unbeaten 43-0 record that includes 34 knockouts. Promoters have hyped the encounter as a potential changing of the boxing guard, with Munguia poised to dethrone an opponent who made his professional debut way back in 2005. Unsurprisingly, Alvarez — and oddsmakers — see it differently. “I don’t care about experiences versus youth, I’m Canelo,” Alvarez said this week. “I have everything I need to win and I know exactly what I need to do. “This is going to be a great Mexican war. Munguia and I both come to win, but I am going to win and win decisively.” Alvarez, who holds the IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO super-middleweight belts, last fought in September, comfortably defeating Jermell Charlo by unanimous decision. But whether he still has the raw power to handle Munguia inside the distance remains an open question. Alvarez has not stopped anyone since scoring an 11th-round technical knockout of Caleb Plant in 2021. Munguia, by contrast, has built a reputation as a knockout artist, winning four of his past five fights inside the distance. Under the guidance of trainer Freddie Roach, the long-time trainer of Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao, Munguia has honed an explosive, aggressive style that his camp believes can trouble Alvarez. The flipside, however, is that Munguia’s defense has often looked vulnerable and against a counter-puncher of Alvarez’s pedigree, that could prove costly. “Canelo has a great deal of experience and has faced great fighters. I may not have the same resume, but I have youth on my side,” Munguia said. “I’m glad that he wants to knock me out, because I come with the same mentality. I’m going to knock him out.” Promoter Oscar De La Hoya — who was involved in an ugly confrontation with Alvarez at Wednesday’s final press conference in Las Vegas — is convinced that an upset is in the cards. “I truly believe this will be a changing of the guard for Mexican boxing, from Canelo to Munguia,” De La Hoya said. “Jaime has always dared to be great and Saturday night he will fulfill his dream and become world champion.” De La Hoya incensed Alvarez by dredging up the Mexican champion’s two failed drug tests in 2018, which Alvarez has always blamed on contaminated meat. In a tirade laced with expletives and homophobic slurs, Alvarez accused De La Hoya — his former promoter until an acrimonious 2020 split — of “stealing” from his fighters. “He tries to steal from his fighters, that’s what he does,” Alvarez said. “He’s mad I left Golden Boy. I’m the diamond in Golden Boy. Golden Boy is not the same without me.”",

    "text": "उज्जैन: मध्य प्रदेश को गौरवान्वित करने वाली यह खबर है. दरअसल, उज्जैन की 18 वर्षीय बेटी ने उज्जैन सहित समूचे प्रदेश का नाम रोशन किया है. उज्जैन की बेटी नव्या तिवारी का NDA में सिलेक्शन हुआ है. जो कि मध्य प्रदेश से एकमात्र सिलेक्शन है. नव्या ने बताया ट्रेनिंग के बाद अब भारतीय वायुसेना में फ्लाइंग ऑफिसर के लिए उसे चुना जाएगा. उसने वर्ष 2024 में एग्जाम दिया था. 4 लाख बच्चो में से 400 बच्चों का सिलेक्शन होना था. जिसमें एमपी से एकमात्र नव्या चुनी गई है.\nनव्या ने किया पिता के सपने को पूरा\nअपने सिलेक्शन पर नव्या तिवारी ने बताया कि \"मुझे अपने माता-पिता, शिक्षक के मार्गदर्शन से ये स्थान मिला है. नव्या का कहना है में भी एक दिन लेफ्टिनेंट व्योमिका और कर्नल सोफिया की तरह हमारे भारत देश को रिप्रेजेंट करूंगी. जो मेरे पिता मेरे लिए सबसे बड़ी प्रेरणा रहे. नव्या ने कहा कि आज मैं अपने पिता का सपना जी रही हूं. मेरे लिए इससे ज्यादा गर्व की बात कुछ नहीं हो सकती.\nकौन है नव्या\nनव्या के पिता नवलेश और मां संध्या उज्जैन के निजातपुरा में रहते हैं. नव्या ने बताया उसने 11वीं 12वीं की पढ़ाई राजस्थान के सीकर से की. 12वीं कक्षा में हाल ही में 90% उसे प्राप्त हुए हैं. सितंबर 2024 में नव्या ने NDA का एग्जाम दिया था, रिटर्न के बाद इंटरव्यू हुआ. नव्या ने देश भर के 4 लाख छात्र छात्राओं में से 400 में स्थान प्राप्त किया. खास बात यह है कि नव्या मध्य प्रदेश से एक मात्र छात्रा है. जिसने इस उपलब्धि को हासिल किया.\nइसके लिए 5 दिन का इंटरव्यू था. 06 से 10 जनवरी तक बनारस में उसे नव्या ने क्लियर किया. इंटरव्यू और मेरिट लिस्ट में नव्या को ऑल इंडिया 260वीं रैंक और गर्ल्स कैटेगिरी में 27वीं रैंक प्राप्त हुई है.\n21 जून को रिपोर्टिंग\nनव्या अब 21 जून को पुणे के खड़वासला में NDA अकादमी में ट्रेनिंग के लिए पहुंचेंगी. ट्रेनिंग पूरी करने के बाद हैदराबाद एयरपोर्ट अकादमी में नव्या फ्लाइंग ऑफिसर बनकर देश सेवा करेंगी.\n2 लाख लड़कियों में 20 का नाम, एक नव्या\nनव्या ने बताया ये \"मेरे पापा नवलेश तिवारी का सपना था. उनका इंटरव्यू बनारस बोर्ड से क्लियर नहीं हुआ था. आज मेरा इंटरव्यू वहीं से क्लियर हुआ है, तो खुशी है. पापा का सपना सच कर रही हूं. ये परीक्षा सबसे कठिन होती है. सबसे पहले रिटर्न एग्जाम होता है, जिसमें देश भर के 4 लाख स्टूडेंट बैठते हैं. जिसमें करीब 2 लाख लड़कियां होती हैं. उसमें से 8 हजार रिटर्न एग्जाम में क्वालीफाई होते हैं. जिसमें 3 हजार लड़कियां पाई हुईं थी. फिर पांच दिन का इंटरव्यू प्रोसेस होता है. जिसमें से 400 का सिलेक्शन होता है. एक गलती आपको बाहर कर देती है. नव्या ने बताया इस एग्जाम में मेरे साथ 2 लाख लड़कियां थीं. जिसमें से 20 का सेलेक्शन होना था.\n3 साल की होगी ट्रेनिंग\nनव्या ने कहा कि \"18 से 20 साल की उम्र में ही यह ट्रेनिंग होती है. 3 साल की मेरी ट्रेनिंग है. नव्या ने तैयारी कर रहे छात्र छात्राओं के लिए कहा मेरा पहली बार में सिलेक्शन है. आपका भी सिलेक्शन हो सकता है, बस कभी भी चीजों को आधे-अधूरे में ना छोड़ें. उम्मीद है तो लगे रहें, कामयाबी जरूर मिलेगी. जो भी करें इमानदारी से करें और भारत में अगर पैदा हुए हैं, तो भारत के लिए कुछ करने का जज्बा मन में रखें. देश सेवा डिफेंस में जाने पर ही नहीं अगर आप अपने आसपास के वातावरण को भी मजबूत और स्वच्छ बना रहे हैं, तो यह भी एक देश सेवा है. इसलिए कभी भी किसी भी फैसले से हारे नहीं.",
