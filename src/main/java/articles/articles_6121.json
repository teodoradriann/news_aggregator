    "title": "Battle Mountain boys basketball uses full-court press to jump start rally over Vail Mountain School",
    "text": "News | Jan 16, 2025\nSawyer Willis helped Battle Mountain come back and defeat Vail Mountain School 42-39 on Tuesday night in Edwards.\nRex Keep/Courtesy photo It was all Gore Rangers in the first half of Tuesday’s rivalry game between the Vail Mountain and Battle Mountain boys basketball teams.\nThe second told a different story, though.\n“I’d describe it as a tale of two halves,” Vail Mountain coach Andrew Behrendt said after his team surrendered a 10-point first-half lead in losing to the Huskies 42-39 in Edwards. “I think we were the better team in the first half and they came storming back in the second — and it kind of came down to the wire.”\n“To be able to come back from a deficit like that and collect themselves in the middle of the game — and rally back like that — I’m so happy for those boys,” Battle Mountain coach Rudy Ybarra said after his team completed the rally to protect its home court.\nIt was clear both teams wrote up good scouting reports going into the cross-county conflict, Ybarra said. The Huskies were forced into dribbling with their weak hands and struggled to find offensive flow throughout the first eight minutes as the Gore Rangers built a 10-6 lead.\nSupport Local Journalism Donate\n“(They) looked confident, collected and very calm on the defensive end and it helped them get more points on the offensive end, too,” Ybarra said.\nDefense led to offense in the second quarter as well as Vail Mountain, ranked No. 13 in 2A, outscored its 5A opponent 16-10 in the second. Ybarra said he and his players went into the locker room looking for something in the toolbox to spark a run.\n“We all asked each other, ‘what can we do differently to succeed here?,'” he said. “And we all agreed it was a full-court press we’d been practicing.”\nThe Gore Rangers managed the pressure well initially, even building their lead to 30-18 with 5:20 to go in the third quarter. But as fatigue set in, they struggled to initiate effective half-court offense coming out of the press break. Behrendt said he could tell his players felt “rushed and panicked a little bit.” To make matters worse, the Gore Rangers were just 2-for-10 from the free throw line in the second half. The Huskies capitalized, going on a 17-2 run to go up 35-32 with 2:30 remaining in the game.\n“I knew they weren’t going to give up after they gave up such a big lead,” Ybarra said of his mindset at that point. “So we knew they had something in their bag. Andrew is such a creative guy.”\nWith 1:37 left, Blake Roberts floated in two of his team-high nine points off a hard, right-handed drive from the wing to put the Huskies back up by three. Grant Iverson responded with a deep triple of his own 20 seconds later.\n“It was big,” Behrendt said of the clutch 3-pointer from Iverson, who had a game-high 12 points. “It was important to tie it up to give ourselves a fighting chance.”\nComing out of a timeout, Jackson Wansley gave a dribble hand off to Roberts, who charged off a double screen with his left hand. His drive ended with the ball deflecting off a Vail Mountain player’s foot. On the ensuing out of bounds play, Charlie Strauch found an uncovered Wansley in the corner. The junior drilled the a go-ahead 3-pointer in front of his bench. Ybarra said Wansley and Sawyer Willis were instrumental in securing the win through their leadership and on-court vision.\n“They communicated to their guys on how to stay focused and calm during the game,” the coach said. “And they just read the floor really well.”\nCharlie Vidal made things interesting, though, scoring with 38 seconds left to make it a one-point affair. But Wansley hit two free throws on the next possession and Vail Mountain couldn’t convert a 3-pointer before the final buzzer.\nEven though Behrendt identified areas for growth — “turnovers, finishing, handling pressure, stuff like that,” he said — Tuesday’s game was an improvement from last year’s trip to Edwards, a 60-26 loss.\n“I think we are a very different team this year,” he added. “Our team chemistry is really strong this year; I think we’re really deep. … I often tell these guys, for all the nitpicking, we’re a good team that can fix some things to get better. And ultimately our goal is to be playing the best basketball at the end of the year.”\nVail Mountain fell to 5-3 going into Friday’s home contest against De Beque. Battle Mountain improved to 3-4 and will look to keep the momentum going Thursday night at Delta. Having come back against Rifle and Meeker earlier this year, Ybarra said Tuesday’s win proved that basketball has two halves for a reason.\n“That’s what it’s there for: to show a different side of us and adjust so we can get a win,” he said. “So I think the boys seeing that — we’ve got more wins coming, just with that confidence.”\nSupport Local Journalism Donate",

    "title": "A CT regional market plans expansion in next year. ‘We’ve really outgrown our kitchen’",
    "text": "A regional, third-generation,\nfamily-owned grocery chain is planning to expand its operation with a new dedicated kitchen space that will meet demand for its prepared food items.\nThe\nHighland Park Market grocery store, which has locations in Farmington, Glastonbury, and Manchester, recently bought the Bogner Quality Meats building at 349 Wetherell St. in Manchester.\nThe decades-old butcher shop, which has operated out of the location since the 1960s, will stay in the building for another year before moving to another spot in town.\nHighland Park Market bought the nearly 20,000 square-foot building for $1.25 million in late August, according to the company.\nUnder the purchase-sales agreement, Bogner will continue to lease the building where it is currently located for another year until Highland Park Market takes over the space. The grocery store bought the building due to increased demand for its prepared food items.\n“We’ve really outgrown our kitchen at our Manchester location,” said Molly Devanney, vice president of Highland Park Market.\n“If you were to look at our kitchen now, we’ve got people on top of each other just trying to get all the orders done. So this will enable us a state of the art kitchen and allow our employees really more space to just do their jobs.”\nWhile plans remain tentative, Devanney said that the company would like to utilize the building primarily for storage and to prepare food that would then be distributed to its other retail locations.\nIn addition, a small meat counter and commissary is planned to sell grab-and-go prepared food items.\n“We also don’t have a lot of freezer space in Manchester for refrigeration, so with the new building we were able to order extra product in for the holidays,” Devanney said. “We’re using the building just for storage right now until we can get in there and do some major renovation work to the property.”\nOver the next year, Devanney said, the company will begin to finalize plans for the space and start renovation work to transform the building. However, construction isn’t planned for a while until the terms of the purchase-sales agreement are fully realized.\n“We want to be good landlords and take care of the people there now,” Devanney said.\n“They’re great people and we want to be very respectful of them. We’re not pushing them out and we’re making sure to give them plenty of time,” Devanney said.\nBogner Quality Meats spokeswoman Beth Coviello said that the extra time will allow the company to find a permanent location and that both staff and ownership are grateful towards Highland Park Market for their hospitality.\n“We want to assure our customers that we aren’t going away,” Coviello said. “We will be staying in Manchester. While we have our eye on a new location, we still have to get permits and approval at the moment. So we’re hoping to figure all that over the next few months.”\nHighland Park Market has been a staple in Manchester since opening in 1886, according to its website. Jack Devanney purchased the small market in 1958 and it has remained in the Devanney family since then. Today, the Devanney family’s third generation has taken over the day-to-day operations of the stores.\n“One of those things are grandfather did was really take the time to get to know his customers and give them the products that they want,” Devanney said.\n“Everything we do involves people. Whether that’s taking care of our employees or our customers. We support the community that supports us. We love our customers and I think that’s what separates us from other grocery stores. We care about quality as well. But it’s really about providing that customer service.”\nStephen Underwood can be reached at sunderwood@courant.com.",

    "text": "Tech giant Meta has rolled back restrictions around topics such as gender and sexual identity, a sweeping move advocacy groups fear will fuel hate speech.\nThe change coincides with the company's shock announcement on Tuesday that it was ending its third-party fact-checking program in the United States and adopting a crowd-sourced model to police misinformation similar to the Elon Musk-owned X.\nThe latest version of Meta's community guidelines said its platforms -- which include Facebook and Instagram -- would now permit users to accuse people of \"mental illness or abnormality\" based on their gender or sexual orientation.\nThe updated version also struck out previous restrictions on referring to women as \"household objects or property,\" Black people as \"farm equipment\" and transgender or non-binary people as \"it.\"\n\"We're getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate,\" Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, wrote in a blog post.\n\"It's not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\"\nBut advocacy groups quickly voiced concern that the policy shift threatened the safety of marginalized communities.\n\"Removal of fact-checking programs and industry-standard hate speech policies make Meta's platforms unsafe places,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the advocacy group GLAAD.\n\"Without these necessary hate speech and other policies, Meta is giving the green light for people to target LGBTQ people, women, immigrants, and other marginalized groups with violence, vitriol, and dehumanizing narratives.\"\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, in a video announcing the changes, claimed the previous restrictions on immigration and gender were \"just out of touch with mainstream discourse.\"\n\"What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it has gone too far,\" Zuckerberg said.\nThe move comes just weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House with his Republican Party also back in control of Congress after fiercely attacking social media speech restrictions during the election campaign.\nGender identity issues were also a key line of attack by Trump and Republicans against their Democratic opponents.\nAfter the move was announced on Tuesday, CyberWell, a nonprofit focused on combating online antisemitism, denounced the \"systematic lowering of the bar\" by Meta on policies against hate speech and harassment.\n\"This change particularly undermines the safety of all marginalized communities,\" CyberWell executive director Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor said in a statement.\nbur-ac/des\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

    "title": "Baidu Revenue Beats as AI Cloud Offsets Sluggish Online Marketing",
    "text": "TMTPOST -- The American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Baidu, Inc. slumped 5.9% to their two-month low on Thursday even though artificial intelligence (AI) technology helped China’s top search engine operator report better-than-expected sales.\nBaidu said its revenue for three months ended September 30, 2024 came in RMB33.56 billion (US$4.6 billion). That represented a year-over-year (YoY) decrease of 3%, the biggest yearly drop in more than two years, but still topping analysts’ projection of RMB33.53 billion. Decline in the top line accelerated as the previous quarter saw Baidu revenue edged down about 0.4% from a year ago, the company’s first YoY decline since the third quarter of 2022.\nBaidu’s quarterly bottom line first missed Wall Street anticipation this year, highlighting how China’s economic slowdown dragged companies as its key advertisers span indutries from property devlopers to automakers. Net income for the third quarter jumped 14% YoY to RMB7.63 billion, or US$1.09 billion, less than analysts expected US$857.17 millon. On non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income dipped 19% YoY to RMB5.89 billion, compared with a 8% YoY fall three months earlier. Adjusted earnings per American depositary share (ADS) was RMB16.6 with a 19% YoY decrease, versus analysts projected RMB17.73. Adjusted operating income dropped 8% YoY to RMB7.01 billion, compared with a 2% YoY increase for the previous quarter. That was still better than projection of RMB6.36 billion.\nBaidu Core, which accounts for nearly 79% of overall revenue for the third quarter, stagnated for the September quarter. The segment generated RMB26.52 billion with almost no growth compared with a year earlier. The mainstay segment decelerated as it had eked out a 1% YoY gain for the second quarter, down from a quarterly growth rate of 4% in the start of this year. Net income of Baidu Core added 17% YoY to RMB7.54 billion, while non-GAAP adjusted net income fell 18% YoY to RMB5.68 billion.\nOnline marketing, a major part of Baidu Core, brought RMB18.8 billion with a 4% YoY decrease, versus a 2% drop from April to June. Non-online marketing revenue was RMB7.7 billion with a 12% YoY gain, mainly driven by AI Cloud business. That division accelerated from a 10% increase for the previous quarter.\n“Baidu Core's flattish third quarter top line reflected the ongoing weakness in our online marketing business, offset by the growth of our AI Cloud business. Our strong AI capabilities are gaining broader market recognition, as evidenced by increasing adoption of Ernie,” Baidu CEO RObin Li said.\nFor the third quarter, Baidu expanded the Ernie family with two enhanced lightweight models, Speed Pro and Lite Pro. Baidu’s flagship model, ERNIE 4.0 Turbo, has achieved notable improvements in inference efficiency, with throughput increasing by 48% compared to its debut in June. Thanks to Erine's enhanced capabilities, wide-ranging applications, and improved cost efficiencies, Baidu has seen a substantial increase in API calls, Li said. He noted Ernie handled approximately 1.5 billion API calls daily in November, a significant jump from 600 million in August. Meanwhile, over 1.7 trillion tokens were generated on a daily basis.\nLi underscore momentum of AI Cloud. Revenue from AI Cloud reached RMB4.9 billion for the third quarter, maintaining double-digit YoY increase at 11% while sustaining non-GAAP operating profitability. Generative AI-related revenue maintained strong growth momentum and remained a key growth driver, accounting for about 11% of Baidu’s total AI Cloud revenue in the third quarter, up from 9% in the preceding quarter, Li said. He commemted that this trend reflected increasing recognition of Ernie's value among enterprise customers.\nApollo Go, Baidu's autonomous ride-hailing service, provided 988,000 rides in the third quarter, up 20% YoY. As of October 28, the cumulative rides provided to the public by Apollo Go surpassed 8 million. During the third quarter, rides provided by Apollo Go's fully driverless vehicles accounted for over 70% of total rides nationwide. The proportion of fully driverless rides further increased to 80% in October.\n“Apollo Go continues to lead the global autonomous ride-hailing market, hitting another milestone with our sixth-generation autonomous vehicle now operating on public roads across multiple cities in China,” Li said.”Despite the near-term pressures, we remain steadfast in our AI-focused strategy and are confident in our long-term trajectory. As we further scale AI, we are emboldened to find how it can drive innovations and create value for consumers, enterprises and society at large.”",

    "title": "智谱携\"沉思\"加入Agent\"混战\" 记者实测结果来了！|科创板日报_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "《科创板日报》4月3日讯（记者 李明明） 继与多地国资合作之后，大模型独角兽智谱又在产品方面迎来新进展。\n近日，智谱推出具有深度思考和操作执行能力的Agent 产品“AutoGLM 沉思”（以下简称“沉思”），并已经免费上线。据介绍，“沉思”能查看如知网、小红书、公众号、巨潮资讯等不对外开放API的信源，同时具有多模态理解能力，能够理解网页上的图文信息。\n在介绍“沉思”时，智谱CEO张鹏略带调侃地表示，“这个Agent不用39美元，免费而且不用邀请码。”此前，国产智能体Manus曾掀起一股关于AI Agent的讨论热潮，但因为需要邀请码发放有限，绝大部分用户只能观望，无法真正体验。\n《科创板日报》记者在实测中发现，“沉思”在思考过程中展现出从理解并拆解问题入手，结合信息检索快速构建解决方案框架的能力。\n记者实测“ 沉思”\n《科创板日报》记者使用“ 沉思”实测了七个任务，它均能较好地完成，举其中三个例子来展示其推理过程。\n任务一让 Agent 完成高度定制化的旅行方案规划，以往都需要专业的旅行规划师才能完成。可以看到，“沉思”迅速打开了相关购票、预定酒店的网站并进行一系列解析后，给出了一份数千字的详细报告。\n任务二中，“沉思”对月坛附近主要门店位置、门店特色、不同平台外卖服务的配送、价格等多维度对比，并生成详细表格和报告。\n任务三中，“沉思”不停搜索知乎、新浪、搜狐等众多网站，并迅速生成抖音视频脚本，其文采水平和完成度均较高。\n总体感受是，“沉思”的执行非常迅速，甚至可以打开很多用户自己的盲区网站，可以大幅度节省时间和决策成本。\n但亦有一些用户告诉《科创板日报》记者，比起边想边搜，深度思考类模型产品更应该实现的功能是边聊边想，在思考的每一个节点，用户都能参与进来进行交互，并及时纠正模型动作，以防模型进行一些不必要甚至是错误的思考行为和操作。\n智能体的应用形态，还将回归到模型上\n而随着Agent爆发的持续迫近，有关Agent的实现方式和最终形态，也成为当前AI从业者的争论焦点。此前，Pleias的联合创始人Alexander Doria曾提到，未来AI智能体的发展方向是模型本身，而不是工作流，并列举了Manus的例子，认为其提示驱动无法完成复杂的任务。\n张鹏对《科创板日报》记者表示，其观点与Alexander Doria基本一致。“未来的新应用形态，尤其是智能体的应用形态，还是会回归到模型上。这也是我们一直所倡导的模型即场景的概念，未来很多的应用会以模型为核心，包上一个很浅的或者很薄的产品化、应用性的壳就会变成一个产品。模型能力一旦提升，产品能力就会得到提升，这是很典型的新应用范式的变化。”\n“但是，当下AGI之路刚刚开始，模型的能力还无法达到完全类比人的水平，模型能力有限，需工程化解决实际应用问题。永远是模型进，工程退。其技术越先进，需要工程化的事情越简单。所以，终极的目标是当造出一个像人一样聪明的脑子之后，工程上的事情就比较少，只需要给它装上手和眼睛就可以像人一样完成很多工作，这也是AGI的终极目标。” 张鹏说。\n另有大模型企业人士告诉《科创板日报》记者，Manus更倾向于以AI技术优化具体场景中的流程与体验，而非聚焦于底层技术突破。“然而，Manus本身未能形成有效的产品壁垒，后续大量开源版本Manus的出现，让其稀有性被打破，‘沉思’的出现就是一个例子。”\n目前来说，Agent要达到可用，需要打通一些公域和私域之间的数据壁垒，以及打通不同平台之间的壁垒。\n比如，Manus此前短暂爆火，但随后在复杂任务中的表现屡出状况。有实测案例显示，解析文件时，Manus对非标准格式的兼容性较差，部分数据直接丢失；网页爬取环节频繁遭遇验证码拦截，任务中断。\n提到解决办法，张鹏告诉《科创板日报》记者，公司在公开演示 “沉思”时选择了大众易理解的通用场景。但针对专业领域、企业用户或存在特定限制条件的用户，智谱已构建了一套功能化的解决方案。这套方案将通过公司未来的 MaaS 平台（模型即服务）及智能体开发平台进行沉淀，开发者和企业用户可基于这两大基础平台便捷调用资源，实现快速适配与功能扩展。张鹏特别强调，这些均属于产品层面的优化，而非模型层面的问题。\n“比如说登录网盘等这些额外的操作，本质上还是智能体聪明程度不如人类，如果其可以通过图灵测试，能力与人类非常接近了，那现在的封禁和拦截策略也很难做的到。”\n他进一步解释，通用Agent不能有短板，包括文本、思考、操作、环境感知和理解的能力、调用工具、反复尝试的能力等，都不能有明显的短板。一旦有明显短板存在，就会导致应用成功率急剧下降。\n“我们始终坚持为所有模型注入语言多模态能力，源于对人类认知本质的理解。\"”张鹏指出，人类作为具备综合认知能力的生命体，其智能评判体系具有整体性特征。当公众审视 AI 系统时，往往不会局限于单一维度的能力对比，而是通过多模态交互体验形成整体认知。即使某模型在逻辑推理、自然语言生成等单项指标上超越人类，但若多模态交互能力存在短板，仍会被感知为 \"智能缺陷\"。这一现象揭示出，技术研发者不应简单归咎于外部环境，而需从模型架构层面重新审视技术演进路径。\n随着Agent能力的不断演进，未来其在硬件端的入口也会更加丰富，包括 机器人 、眼镜等设备都将成为新的接入点。而这又带来了新的问题：调用这些入口还面临哪些挑战？\n张鹏对此表示， AutoGLM更早是应用在手机端，本次“沉思”只不过是把它移到了PC上。而其他智能硬件，比如眼镜、车载以及平板等端侧亦类似，都可以接入 。“但是里面确实有一些问题，比如，不同类型的设备，最终的交互方式不一样，比如说眼镜不可能有键盘，就要用语音交互，语音就引入了全新的模态。”\n“所以，当前阶段，接入Agent远非简单地‘插入芯片、接入现成的SDK’那么容易，这种'即插即用'的便捷性仍是未来愿景，当下还无法实现。”",
