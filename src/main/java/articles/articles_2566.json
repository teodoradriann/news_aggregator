    "title": "Mount Gambier's OneFortyOne Jubilee Sawmill to turn steam into renewable electricity - ABC News",
    "text": "Mount Gambier's OneFortyOne Jubilee Sawmill to turn steam into renewable electricity In short: The owner of a sawmill in Mount Gambier will spend $30 million on a new boiler and steam turbine to produce more than enough electricity for the plant. A similar system ran from the 1950s to the 1970s. What's next? The electricity could be used for the electricity grid or to power vehicles at the mill in the future. One of the largest sawmills in Australia will turn wood waste into enough electricity to run the plant and export to the grid in a possible return to a situation that ended last century. OneFortyOne is spending about $30 million on a new boiler and steam turbine at the Jubilee Sawmill in Mount Gambier as part of a $90 million site upgrade. The company says the renewable biomass power generation project will generate 43,800 megawatt hours of electricity per year when work is complete in 2026. OneFortyOne chief executive Wendy Norris said this would be enough to run the plant and either sell the remainder to the power network or use it to charge future electric forklifts, trucks and other machinery. \"What's really exciting about this project is that the turbine will generate enough electricity to power the entire Jubilee site from renewable wood fibre,\" Ms Norris said. \"That helps us to achieve over 70 per cent of our 2030 emissions reduction target so we're very proud of that achievement so far ahead of 2030.\" South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas visited the sawmill for the announcement. \"That's an example of where the private sector is stepping up to the plate,\" he said. \"It's a $30 million investment from OneFortyOne and it's all a demonstration of how the forestry industry is becoming increasingly renewable in a way that of course puts it in demand not just locally but also globally.\" Back to historic practice The formerly state-owned Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) started running a power station using waste from the Jubilee Sawmill in 1957 to produce electricity for the south east after concerns about a lack of supply in the area. Large power lines later connected Mount Gambier with Adelaide in 1963 and 1972. Phil McInnes worked for ETSA from the 1960s until 2004 and is a member of the Mount Gambier History Group. Mr McInnes said more uses were found for the wood offcuts so it was then unviable to use it to make electricity. \"It just got too expensive and we ended up having to shut the power station down because it was all going to panel board, core board — a lot of people don't know about core board but core board was actually manufactured in Mount Gambier as well,\" he said. \"There were quite a lot of things that used the chips — and it was also carted to Portland.\" One of the turbines blowing up after a small steam leak and circuit-breaker fault sealed the end of the mill producing power for Mount Gambier in 1976. \"Everything just went haywire with vibrations and … the exciter on the end which generates the DC for the excitation, that just cracked off and fell on the floor,\" Mr McInnes said. The project will not reduce the amount of steam expelled from the sawmill or the smell of tannins produced at the site. Project to reduce emissions South Australian Forest Products Association chief executive Nathan Paine said the project sent a clear message to policy makers. “OneFortyOne’s investment into a renewable cogeneration power project will deliver a 50 per cent reduction in OneForty One’s total scope one emissions and over 85 per cent of their total scope two emissions, saving over 9,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent,\" he said. \"Not only will this new cogeneration facility generate all the energy for the Jubilee Sawmill, the largest sawmill in Australia, it is estimated to generate 20,000mWh of excess renewable electricity which will be returned to the grid or in the future used to power vehicles and machinery.\" ABC South East SA — local news in your inbox ABC Privacy Collection Statement .",

    "text": "This month, the Ikea furniture store is releasing a new limited edition line of furniture that not only functions as storage but as a home gym, too. The Swedish furniture company is not only putting out furniture pieces that can also be used for basic exercises in their DAJLIEN line, but weights, cushions for supporting your knees, Bluetooth speakers, yoga mats and straps, and even wellness gear. From blankets to ponchos to slippers, the DAJLIEN line has everything you need to work out at home and destress afterward. All the products in this special line have soft pastel colors meant to match the decor of your home.\nSarah Fager, a designer at Ikea in Sweden, explained the goals for the company's new furniture line to the Ikea Newsroom : \"Not everyone feels safe or comfortable going to a gym and at home we often deal with small space and time constraints. DAJLIEN was born from the desire to find smart solutions that address these limitations and help people create a convenient and motivating place for exercise\", Fager said. \"We wanted to create smart, beautiful products to inspire and redefine training as a fun, easy and natural everyday activity.\"\nWhat the Ikea gym equipment line includes\nIKEA One very versatile product from the DAJLIEN line is a bamboo bench with a removable top for storage that doubles as an exercise bench. You can keep your weights or other workout gear inside of it, neatly tucked away for whenever you need it, and the bench functions as a coffee table when not in use. Ikea is also selling a sleek white utility cart with large bamboo wheels to hold your equipment when you're done working out. And since the company's exercise mats come in stylish green colors, they could easily double as simple rugs, or you could roll them up and stash them in the utility cart. Additionally, the DAJLIEN step stool is a gorgeous light-colored wood that's perfect for leg day or reaching something on the top shelf of your cupboards.\nWith their new limited edition line, Ikea hopes to help their customers experience comfort, convenience, and style when working out at their home gym . Akanksha Deo, another designed at Ikea in Sweden, told the company's newsroom about the goals of the collection: \"DAJLIEN is all about supporting movement and helping people live more active lives at home. We have designed a collection that helps bridge the gap between home and active life, that recognizes that training can take many shapes and forms and that you don't need a lot of space to do a simple workout\", Deo said.",

    "text": "China is preparing its legion of hackers to “wreak havoc” on critical US infrastructure, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned lawmakers Wednesday.\nDigital infiltrators working for the People’s Republic of China are specifically targeting American water treatment plants, the electrical grid, oil and natural gas pipelines and transportation systems, according to the FBI director, who noted that the Chinese hackers far outnumber the bureau’s cyber personnel.\n“China’s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real world harm to American citizens and communities if and when China decides the time has come to strike,” Wray told the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.\n“To quantify what we’re up against, the PRC has a bigger hacking program than that of every major nation combined,” the FBI director said.\n“In fact, if you took every single one of the FBI cyber agents and intelligence analysts and focus them exclusively on the China threat, China’s hackers would still outnumber FBI cyber personnel by at least 50-to1.”\n3\nWray warned that the FBI’s cyber and intelligence analysts are outnumbered 50-to-1 by China’s hacking force. Annabelle Gordon – CNP / MEGA\n3\nChina’s hacking program is larger than that of every other major nation combined, according to the FBI director.

Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) said he had no doubt that the PRC’s hacking program was laying the groundwork for the next major world conflict.\n“The difference here is that this has crossed the line from collecting on us and using cyber to get inside of our systems to putting malware in that can take out our systems,” Waltz said during an appearance on Fox News. “So, we have to start thinking about this differently.”\nWaltz further argued that cyberattacks against critical US infrastructure should be considered “an act of war.”\n“There is no difference in sending a missile into a dam or a water treatment facility than shutting it down through cyber means,” the Florida Republican said. “It’s an attack. It’s an act of war. We’ve got to begin thinking about it that way.”\nWray insisted that the US must remain vigilant and actively defend against threats from Beijing.\n“Otherwise, China has shown it will make us pay,” he said.",
