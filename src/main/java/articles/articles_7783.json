    "text": "Tel Aviv, Jan 19 (IANS) The family of Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage in Hamas captivity, celebrated his first birthday on a sad note.Kfir Bibas was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 along with his parents Yarden and Shiri and four-year-old brother Ariel.\nTo mark the day, a large crowd filled the Hostage Square (NYSE: SQ ) in Tel Aviv on Thursday, with many holding orange balloons, in acknowledgment of Kfir’s red hair.\nThere was also a large screen displaying the number of days the hostages have been held in Gaza.\nIn a social media post, Gali Tarshansky (13), who was also captured by Hamas and released as part of the week-long ceasefire deal on November 29, 2023, said: “Cute and sweet Kfir, happy birthday. We are waiting for you to return to us safely and quickly and we will celebrate with a cake and gifts, like a one-year-old child should celebrate.”\nChildren who have returned from Hamas captivity prepared greeting cards to mark the birthday.\nFour-year-old Oriya Brodutch, who was also kindapped along with her parents and released on November 26, 2023, wrote: “Happy birthday, may you return home soon.”\nEmily Hand (nine), who was also kidnapped and later released on November 26, said: “I hope you get out of there as soon as possible. I understand the feeling because I was there too. Sending you hugs and love.”\nDuring the function, Shiri Bibas’ cousin, Yifat Zeiler, said: “No abductee should celebrate a birthday in captivity. We thank the children and their families for such a moving gesture, and ask the decision-makers to read these wishes to understand that behind every hostage there is a whole world.”\nHowever It is not clear whether Kfir and his family are still alive.\nThe Hamas has claimed that Kfir, his brother and mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nA hostage Nili Margalit, who spent nearly 50 days in Hamas captivity and released during the ceasefire agreement, revealed that she was with Yarden Bibas when the Hamas terrorists told him his wife and two young children had been killed.\nNili Margaret said that Hamas had ordered Yardin to film a video in which he blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for refusing to bring their bodies back to Israel.\nThe Israeli military has said that the claims made by Hamas regarding the Bibas family have not been verified, and described them as “psychological terror\".\n--IANS\naal/ksk\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "title": "Man Rescued After Being Trapped In 'Mangled' Wrecked Truck For 6 Days",
    "text": "A man who’d been trapped in a “mangled” wrecked truck for six days was rescued Tuesday after he was found by two men scouting for fishing holes. Matthew Reum, 27, crashed a 2016 Dodge Ram truck into Salt Creek, under a bridge off of Interstate 94 near Portage, Indiana, on Dec. 20, according to Indiana state police . Reum was pinned inside the vehicle and drank rainwater to survive, police said. Mario Garcia and Nivardo Delatorre happened upon the truck while searching for places to fish along Salt Creek. Garcia told reporters Tuesday that the truck was “mangled” when they found it, and Reum had scratches. “I looked inside and moved the white airbag and there was a body in there,” Garcia said. “I went to touch it and he turned around, and that just, it almost killed me there because it was kind of shocking, but he was alive and he was very happy to see us. Like, he was really like, I’ve never seen a relief like that.” Delatorre said he and Garcia fish often, but it was the first time he’d been in that area. Reum, a welder who lives in Mishawaka, Indiana, remained hospitalized in critical condition Thursday. ABC News reports that he had surgery to amputate part of his leg on Wednesday. Reum has several broken bones, according to a GoFundMe for him. “No matter how tough things get, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sometimes in the least expected way,” Reum said in a statement released by Memorial Hospital in South Bend on Wednesday.",

    "text": "Israel’s car market is grappling with a surplus of tens of thousands of unsold vehicles, many of them electric, as importers fiercely compete for customers’ wallets. While some tactics to attract buyers are legitimate, others fall into a gray area of questionable practices.\nGasoline-powered vehicles leave less room for misleading claims, but\nelectric vehicle (EV)marketing often involves vague promises about charging capabilities, range and trade-in deals, where critical details remain obscured.In recent months, unsubstantiated claims by importers have surged, bombarding consumers with misleading advertisements. Modern cars, especially EVs, rely heavily on smartphone connectivity to allow drivers to control vehicle functions. Two dominant systems, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, enable full phone mirroring on car screens and near-complete control via smartphones.\nInstead, they offer partial “mirroring” solutions that project phone content onto the car’s screen but require downloading proprietary apps, falling short of full integration. Some importers promise “future connectivity” for these systems, but these assurances are often non-binding.\n“They throw out claims like ‘one day Android will be available,’ but there’s no legal commitment,” industry observers note, urging consumers to approach such promises with skepticism.\nEV manufacturers are racing to develop faster-charging technologies, with innovations like advanced battery cooling and high-capacity batteries enabling some Chinese models to add hundreds of kilometers of range in under ten minutes. These advancements, already available in China, are starting to reach Israel, potentially reducing reliance on gasoline.\nHowever, achieving such rapid charging requires not just advanced vehicles but also powerful charging stations, which are scarce in Israel. Most local chargers deliver under 200 kilowatts, with only a few reaching 300 kilowatts and a handful at 350 kilowatts. When importers claim their EVs charge in ten minutes, they often mean “with the right charger,” which is rarely available locally.\nSome importers, like Shlomo Group (\nBYD) and Union Group (Zeekr), hold stakes in charging companies, but the necessary high-speed infrastructure remains underdeveloped. “If importers want their cars to charge in minutes, they need to provide the chargers, which isn’t happening yet,” an industry source said.Israel’s auto market adheres to European or U.S./Canadian regulatory standards, but Chinese vehicles are not exported to North America, leaving Israel reliant on European standards. A loophole allows “small series” imports—vehicles not fully compliant with European regulations—capped at 400 units annually.\nGet the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play:\nhttps://bit.ly/4eJ37pE| Apple App Store:https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNvThis enables a broader range of cars but limits their market presence, as 400 units cannot compete with mainstream models. Importers often fail to disclose that these vehicles are essentially “limited editions,” and the Transportation Ministry has not approved such imports beyond this year.\n“If an importer doesn’t clarify a car’s limited import status or guarantee future availability, that’s a problem,” a regulatory official noted, highlighting the risk for buyers. With new and used car sales sluggish, trade-in deals are a key tool for importers, who operate used car lots and can subsidize transactions by offering list prices for older vehicles to boost new car sales.\nHowever, these “list price” offers come with numerous restrictions, often undisclosed in advertisements. Importers may limit eligible models, exclude cars with manual transmissions or indirect imports or require meticulous inspections that uncover defects to lower trade-in values. Consumers frequently find the fine print buried in the deal’s terms, undermining the appeal of such promotions.\nChinese carmakers innovate at a breakneck pace, releasing entirely new models every five to six years, compared to Western manufacturers’ eight-to-ten-year cycles. Even minor updates, like 800-volt platforms for faster charging or advanced operating systems, are significant.\nIn Israel, however, regulatory alignment with Europe and large existing inventories slow the introduction of these innovations. Many EVs sold in 2025 were imported late last year, delaying the entry of newer models.\nUpgraded Chinese models can significantly devalue older versions, impacting resale values. “Consumers should check online to see if a newer version of their desired car exists,” an analyst advised. “The results can be surprising, as importers aren’t always upfront about selling outdated models.”",

MEKKAH, KOMPAS - The delay of departure for Indonesian hajj pilgrims has occurred once again. The departure of Indonesian hajj pilgrims who are part of the flying group or Kloter 41 Donohudan Embarkation (SOC-41) has been postponed due to aircraft engine damage of Garuda Indonesia. The SOC-41 flight crew was supposed to depart at 07.40 western Indonesian time (WIB). At that time, the congregation was already at the fast track location at Adi Soemarmo Airport, Boyolali Regency, Central Java. Because the plane had engine failure and it was estimated that repairs would take a long time, the prospective Hajj pilgrims were returned to the Hajj dormitory.",

    "text": "Com apenas 39% de taxa de aprovação entre as Micro e Pequenas Indústrias que consultaram empréstimos, taxa de juros alcançou o maior patamar já registrado como principal obstáculo com 47%\nA 14ª Pesquisa Indicador Nacional de Atividade da Micro e Pequena Indústria do SIMPI/Datafolha revela uma visão abrangente do panorama econômico durante o mês de junho/julho. Nesta edição, a pesquisa mostra a relação entre a falta de acesso a capital de giro e empréstimo com o número de Micro e Pequenas Indústrias em atraso no pagamento.\nO número de consultas a empréstimos e financiamentos voltou a cair e alcançou o mesmo patamar do início do ano, com 14%. O número, ainda que 5 pontos percentuais menor que o do último bimestre deixa clara a dificuldade de aprovação, já que desses 14%, apenas 39% das MPI’s tiveram crédito aprovado.\nEm relação às principais dificuldades das MPI’s em conseguir crédito, a taxa de juros segue sendo o maior obstáculo com 47%, sendo esse o maior valor já registrado pela pesquisa. Em regiões, o Estado de São Paulo é o mais insatisfeito com as taxas de juros com 52% das MPI’s.\nAssim como o número de procura a crédito diminuiu, a taxa de inadimplência de clientes das MPI’s também teve uma queda. Os dados saíram de 38% no último bimestre para 27%, esse é o menor resultado já registrado pela pesquisa. No entanto, com 41% das MPI’s sofrendo inadimplência, o Centro-Oeste/Norte é a região mais afetada. Das 27% MPI’s que sofrem inadimplência, 13% afirmam que o valor corresponde a mais de 30% do faturamento mensal.\nCapital de giro das MPI’s\nNa falta de capital de giro suficiente, com 13% o cheque especial ainda é o mais utilizado pelas MPI’s. Empréstimo PJ foi utilizado por 7% e para o empréstimo pessoal, a procura de crédito teve uma queda, saindo de 11% para 6%, os dados voltam ao mesmo patamar de fevereiro deste ano.\nMaiores endividamentos das MPI’s\nEm âmbito nacional, uma em cada cinco MPI’s afirma ter dívidas com bancos ou instituições financeiras. No entanto, impostos, tributos ou taxas atrasadas também são grandes motivos para endividamento de MPI’s, atingindo 22%.\nQuando o assunto é situação da produção e prestação de serviços atualmente, o valor chegou ao maior registrado neste ano, com 56% das empresas atuando em sua capacidade total. A região com mais produção e prestação de serviços atuando em sua plena capacidade segue com Centro-Oeste com 64%. No entanto, para o Nordeste a situação é pessimista com 29% das MPI’s com maior parte das atividades paradas ou totalmente paradas.\nSobre a pesquisa\nPesquisa realizada pelo SIMPI/Datafolha, o Indicador Nacional de Atividade da Micro e Pequena Indústria, mostra a situação real da categoria. A coleta de dados ocorreu entre os dias 15 e 31 de julho de 2024, foram realizadas 712 entrevistas.",
