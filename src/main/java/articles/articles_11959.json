    "title": "Baltimore to offer paid fellowship program for recent city HBCU graduates",
    "text": "Baltimore will create a fellowship program with the city’s two historically Black colleges and universities to encourage city students to choose careers in public service.\nThe program, which Mayor Brandon Scott, a Democrat, announced Thursday, will use $4 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to pay stipends to 25 recent graduates of Coppin State University and Morgan State University. Graduates will work for a variety of city agencies for nine months while receiving professional development training.\nRecent graduates with a bachelor’s degree will be paid $50,000 annually plus benefits. Those with a graduate degree will receive $65,000 annually. The program will pay an additional $1,000 housing stipend as well as a transportation stipend of up to $500.\nStanding with the presidents of both Coppin State and Morgan State in the City Hall rotunda Thursday, Scott said the city’s HBCUs are the perfect institutions to grow local talent and keep graduates in Baltimore.\n“We have hundreds of critical vacancies throughout Baltimore City government, and we know our HBCUs have thousands of brilliant minds to fill them,” he said.\nCouncil President Nick Mosby, a Democrat, clad in a Tuskegee University sweater, called the fellowship program a win-win for the citizens of Baltimore and city government.\n“This is the right thing to do. It’s the logical thing to do. It should have been done, but you’ve got to take that step in the right direction. And that is what the city of Baltimore has decided to do.”\nFellows will serve in the Baltimore City Health Department, Department of Finance, Department of Housing and Community Development and Department of Transportation. Agencies will have the option to transition participants to full-time employment. The program will begin in September.\nAnthony Jenkins, president of Coppin State, said his university has already been an incubator for local talent. Of Coppin graduates, 70% stay in Maryland and 50% remain in Baltimore, he said.\n“This really falls right into the wheelhouse of who Coppin State University is,” he said.\nDavid Wilson, president of Morgan State, applauded the city for offering a living wage to city graduates.\n“It is one thing to create opportunity, It’s another to recognize that if you really are serious about attracting the best and brightest … a financial incentive is always good.”",

    "text": "Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)(ABX) nega le accuse mosse dal Ministero delle Miniere e dal Ministero delle Finanze del Mali secondo cui non avrebbe onorato gli impegni assunti nell'ambito di un accordo volto a raggiungere una distribuzione più equa dello sfruttamento delle risorse minerarie a beneficio di tutte le parti interessate.\nCome annunciato da Barrick il 30.09.2022, l'azienda e il governo hanno concordato un quadro di negoziazione per raggiungere una risoluzione globale delle loro controversie. Da quella data, Barrick si è attivamente impegnata con il governo per raggiungere tale accordo, i cui termini saranno definiti in un memorandum d'intesa.\nQuesto memorandum d'intesa ha lo scopo di risolvere le divergenze in sospeso e di stabilire i principi che guideranno la partnership di Barrick con il governo in futuro, compreso un aumento della quota statale dei benefici economici generati dal complesso Loulo-Gounkoto.\nAll'inizio di ottobre, Barrick ha effettuato un pagamento al governo di 50 miliardi di FCFA (85 milioni di dollari) nel contesto dei negoziati in corso. Da allora, ha costantemente mantenuto i suoi sforzi per dialogare con il governo. Sebbene Barrick non accetti alcuna accusa di illecito, ha scelto di agire in buona fede come partner di lunga data del Mali, con l'obiettivo di risolvere le controversie in sospeso attraverso questo memorandum d'intesa.\nIl presidente e amministratore delegato di Barrick, Mark Bristow, ha dichiarato che il rapporto reciprocamente vantaggioso dell'azienda con i successivi governi maliani dura da 30 anni e che le occasionali divergenze sono sempre state risolte amichevolmente. Barrick rimane impegnata a trovare una soluzione reciprocamente accettabile all'attuale impasse nell'interesse di tutte le parti interessate.\nQuesto articolo è stato generato e tradotto con il supporto dell'intelligenza artificiale e revisionato da un redattore.

    "text": "Sports\nMikel Arteta says it is a shame that VAR was not clear enough to determine if West Ham’s goal should have stood\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said it was a “shame” that VAR was not clear enough to determine whether West Ham’s first goal in their 2-0 win over the Gunners should have stood.\nTomas Soucek tapped home from close range from Jarrod Bowen’s cross from the left byline on 13 minutes to give the Hammers the lead, but it was unclear as to whether the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA three-and-a-half-minute VAR check saw the technology look at the best angles possible before awarding the goal, with Arteta revealing the officials told him that the image was “not conclusive” – so the on-field decision stood.\n“I haven’t seen it, they only thing they [the officials] said was the image was not conclusive,” said Arteta in his post-match press conference.\n“It’s just a shame that the technology that we have is not that clear that we can say it’s out of play. It’s done, it’s gone and there’s nothing we can do about it now.”\n“So what we have to do is without that, win the game, and with the situations we had today, we had more than enough.”\nArsenal had 30 shots on goal and 77 touches in West Ham’s box – the latter statistic being the most on record since 2008-09 in a single Premier League match for a team who failed to score.\nIn the end, former Arsenal defender Dinos Mavropanos doubled West Ham’s lead after half-time, with David Raya forced to save a Said Benrahma penalty in stoppage time to deny a Hammers third.\nHowever, the post-match talk surrounded the awarding of the first West Ham goal.\nThis is the second time Arsenal have been involved in a situation similar to this, with Newcastle’s winner against the Gunners in November controversially awarded after Joe Willock took the ball near the byline.\nAccording to the written reasons given after Arteta avoided an FA charge for his post-match comments, Willock told the Arsenal players that he had taken it out of play.\nMeanwhile, Bowen – the player directly involved in the incident – said it was difficult to tell whether it had gone out.\n“I haven’t seen it. It’s difficult because the ball was in the air,” he told Amazon Prime Sport. “It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.\n“It was really important to get the first goal. We’ve won tonight. We need to take one game at a time. It sounds boring but we have to keep getting results.”\nIn or out? You decide\nHow Neville and Carragher reacted\nAnalysis: Arsenal’s January window just got bigger\nSky Sports’ Sam Blitz at the Emirates Stadium:\nMikel Arteta may be grateful that Arsenal’s 2-0 loss to West Ham came just days before the January transfer window opens.\nThursday’s night to forget showed why there are doubts that the Gunners can finish on top come May 19.\nThirty shots without a goal – including two big misses from Gabriel Jesus and little-to-no impact from attacking substitutes Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe and Reiss Nelson – raises more questions about whether more firepower is needed, especially a centre forward.\nBut do Arsenal need a full-back too? Takehiro Tomiyasu is likely heading to the Asia Cup and Jurrien Timber is still on the injury list, which means there’s too much focus on Oleksandr Zinchenko – and it’s showing.\nA poor outing against Mohamed Salah at Liverpool and then unconvincing for West Ham’s first goal. Perhaps it may be time to move on from the Ukrainian, especially in the big games.\nBut what order these two positions sit on the priority list – and whether there are decent enough options out there – is still unclear.\nWorld News|| Latest News|| U.S. News Source link",

    "text": "自以色列和伊朗之间的冲突爆发以来，国际油价上涨了约10%。华尔街分析师警告称，如果伊朗局势持续动荡，油价将进一步上涨，美国是否介入冲突是最大的变数。\n周三，国际油价在震荡中收高，因投资者权衡伊以冲突和美国可能直接参与造成供应中断的可能性。布伦特原油期货收高25美分，报每桶76.7美元。美国原油上涨30美分，报75.14美元。在过去的几个交易日里，油价一直处于震荡模式。\n美国总统特朗普在社交媒体上发帖暗示，美国可能介入伊以冲突，以打击伊朗的核计划和领导层。\n据央视新闻最新报道，美国高级官员正在为未来几天对伊朗发动袭击的可能性做准备，但情况仍在演变，可能会发生变化。\n能源行业分析师、专注于油气市场时事通讯的Energy Word的创始人Daniel Dicker对媒体表示：“问题真的变成了这场（冲突）会扩大到什么程度，目前的不确定因素是美国。”\n摩根大通分析师则指出，尽管地缘政治冲突造成的油价冲击往往是短暂的，但产油国的政权更迭可能会带来更持久的价格风险，这可能导致政策和产量的重大转变。\n“自1979年以来，石油生产国发生了八次显著的政权更迭，油价从开始到达到峰值飙升了76%，平均涨幅达30%，并留下了持久的影响。” 摩根大通分析师Natasha Kaneva及其团队在周三的一份报告中写道。\n她表示：“如果以史为鉴，伊朗局势进一步动荡可能导致油价在很长一段时间内持续大幅上涨。”\n作为OPEC+联盟中的第四大产油国，伊朗的石油供应到目前为止尚未受到任何明显的影响。在以色列发动袭击前的几个月里，OPEC提高了产量配额。\n分析师表示，如果伊以冲突得到控制，且主要石油基础设施未受打击，近期的油价飙升势头可能会有所缓和。\n然而，华尔街预计，如果伊朗关闭霍尔木兹海峡——全球石油运输的关键咽喉要道——油价可能会飙升至三位数。分析指出，若美国介入冲突，将加大霍尔木兹海峡航运中断的风险。\n不过，摩根大通分析师也表示，这种情况发生的可能性仍相对较小，“主要是因为这将被视为战争行为”，而美国在该地区拥有强大的海军力量。\n与此同时，据全球最大的成品油油轮运营商之一TORM称，自冲突爆发以来，中东地区的油轮运价飙升了50%。\n关注精彩内容",
