    "text": "Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) Published June 01, 2024 | 06:40 PM\nISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 1st Jun, 2024) Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Chaudhry Salik Hussain on Saturday urged the Hajj welfare staff (Moavineen-e-Hujjaj) to perform their responsibilities with devotion as serving the pilgrims is a sacred duty.\nHe said this on the occasion of orientation sessions held by the Hajj mission for supporting staff in Makkah to make them aware of assisting pilgrims during the Hajj days.\nEmphasising the need for effective communication, the minister suggested that guides fluent in various Pakistani languages should be deployed to assist pilgrims visiting the Haram Sharif for Umrah or prayers. “This move would enhance the experience of pilgrims and help them navigate the area with comfort, given Pakistan 's multicultural nature with language diversity,” he added.\nHe urged the supporting staff to ensure that the pilgrims should be provided with the best possible facilities and services during their stay for Hajj , showing compassion and empathy towards them in addition to their duties.\nThe minister noted that properly marked and men-supported bus pick-up points could facilitate the transportation of pilgrims to and from their residences. He urged guides to be proactive in guiding pilgrims to the right ways towards their destinations, ensuring they were readily available to assist those who may feel distracted or lost on their way to their residences.\nIt is important to note that over four hundred members of Hajj welfare staff currently performing duties in transport, accommodation, and food departments, have already received orientation sessions to prepare them for their roles during the Hajj days.",

    "text": "As a leading non-profit organization, the Cycling and Health Tech Industry R&D Center is going green on Cycling, collaborating with Taiwan partners and looking for global cooperation opportunities.\nFRANKFURT, Germany , July 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cycling and Health Tech Industry R&D Center (CHC), based in Taichung, Taiwan , has exhibited at Eurobike, the leading international cycling fair, which took place from 3-7 July 2024 in Germany . The CHC has been promoting cycling sustainability, fully supported by the Industrial Development Administration (IDA) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan , and is active in making the cycling industry go green.\nAt the biggest bike and eco-mobility event, the CHC not only promotes its service capability and products but also actively communicates with partners who are heading in the same direction towards sustainability, and expects to build a strong relationship and work hard on making bicycles a green product.\nEnvironmental protection is a serious and must-do issue for countries around the world. The CHC, Taiwan's government, and its bicycle industry have been aware of the problem and are taking action together. The Bicycling Alliance for Sustainability (BAS) was therefore established in 2022. With its national net-zero goals by 2050, the BAS has set an initiative to complete the greenhouse gas inventory within 2 years, achieving an annual 3% reduction in carbon emissions, and reaching a 25% reduction per vehicle by 2030.\nIn collaboration with the CHC, BAS, and Taiwan Bicycle Association (TBA), they have focused on promoting green initiatives, integrating the bicycle supply chain to reduce carbon emissions, working on green design innovations, and sustainable manufacturing practices. Moreover, CHC provides services to help small to medium-sized enterprises promote the transformation to sustainable development, including net zero carbon basics courses and related carbon reduction education and training.\nTheir efforts have resulted in positive outcomes on net zero carbon emission promotion, including recycling research, product research, manufacturing research, and so on. Additionally, the section on greenhouse gas (GHG) measurement and carbon footprint verification (CFV) has nearly twice as many enterprises participating. The growing efforts reflected a 5.6% decrease in carbon emission reduction results in 2023.\nWhile pedaling towards sustainability, CHC has also devoted itself to making the cycling dream of disabled people come true. The debut of E-handcycle 2.0 in 2023, is an innovative redevelopment for disabled people to cycle by rotating the handlebars and using their hands to experience the riding. The new generation of E-handcycle contains new features and IoT Tech to make riding safer and easier to control, providing a better riding experience.\nWith the green cycling goals and dreams fulfilling for disabled people, it is encouraging to see the bicycle industry take action on cycling sustainability and create a cycling-friendly environment. There are increasing organizations and companies promoting green initiatives at Eurobike, ensuring that cycling becomes a truly green product and makes our planet greener.\nAbout CHC\nFounded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taiwan's cycling industry, the Cycling & Health Tech Industry R&D Center (CHC) is at the forefront of developing innovative cycling technologies, dedicated to enhancing the cycling experience for all, including those with disabilities. https://en.tbnet.org.tw/\nPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2454755/CHC_press_release_photo_at_Eurobike_2024.jpg\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/chc-pedaling-towards-sustainability-with-taiwan-bicycle-industry-at-eurobike-302189916.html\nCopyright 2024 PR Newswire",

    "text": "If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.” To reach the Native and Strong Lifeline, call “988” and press 4. Amanda MorningStar has watched her children struggle with mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts. She often wonders why. “We’re family-oriented and we do stuff together. I had healthy pregnancies. We’re very protective of our kids,” said MorningStar, who lives in Heart Butte, a town of about 600 residents on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Yet despite her best efforts, MorningStar said, her family faces a grim reality that touches Native American communities nationwide. About a year ago, her 15-year-old son, Ben, was so grief-stricken over his cousin’s suicide and two classmates’ suicides that he tried to kill himself. “Their deaths made me feel like part of me was not here. I was gone. I was lost,” Ben MorningStar said. He spent more than a week in an inpatient mental health unit, but once home, he was offered sparse mental health resources. Non-Hispanic Indigenous people in the United States [die by suicide at higher rates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7137a1.htm) than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suicide rate among Montana’s Native American youth is more than five times the statewide rate for the same age group, according to the [Montana Budget and Policy Center](https://montanabudget.org/post/suicide-rates-in-montana-unacceptably-high-especially-among-american-indians#:~:text=Death%20by%20suicide%20by%20American,than%20five%20times%20as%20high.). Montana ranked [third-worst](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/suicideprevention/SuicideinMontana.pdf) among states for suicide deaths in 2020, and 25% of all suicides in the state from 2017 through 2021 were among Native Americans, even though they represent only 6.5% of the state’s population. Despite decades of research into suicide prevention, suicide rates among Indigenous people have [remained stubbornly high](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7206a4.htm#T1_down), especially among Indigenous people age 10 to 24, according to the CDC. Experts say that’s because the national strategy for suicide prevention isn’t culturally relevant or sensitive to Native American communities’ unique values. Suicide rates have increased among other [racial and ethnic minorities](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107064), too, but to lesser degrees. Systemic issues and structural inequities, including underfunded and under-resourced services from the federal Indian Health Service, also hamper suicide prevention in Indigenous communities. “I worried who was going to keep my son safe. Who could he call or reach out to? There are really no resources in Heart Butte,” Amanda MorningStar said. Ben MorningStar said he is doing better. He now knows not to isolate himself when problems occur and that “it is OK to cry, and I got friends I can go to when I have a bad day. Friends are better than anything,” he said. His twice-a-month, 15-minute virtual telehealth behavioral therapy visits from IHS were recently reduced to once a month. Mary Cwik, a psychologist and senior scientist at the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the systemic shortcomings MorningStar has witnessed are symptoms of a national strategy that isn’t compatible with Indigenous value systems. “It is not clear that the creation of the national strategy had Indigenous voices informing the priorities,” Cwik said. The cause of high suicide rates in Indigenous communities is complex. Native Americans often live with the weight of more [adverse childhood experiences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8098634/#:~:text=The%20average%20adverse%20childhood%20experience,participants%20(2.52%20vs%202.12).) than other populations, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, substance misuse, mental illness, parental separation or divorce, incarceration, and poverty. Those adverse experiences stack upon [intergenerational trauma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9842016/) caused by racial discrimination, colonization, forced relocation, and government-sanctioned abduction to boarding schools that persisted until the 1970s. “There’s no way that communities shaped by these forces for so long will get rid of their problems fast by medical services. A lot of people in Indian Country struggle to retain hope. It’s easy to conclude that nothing can fix it,” said Joseph P. Gone, a professor of anthropology and global health and social medicine at Harvard University and member of the Gros Ventre (Aaniiih) tribal nation of Montana. Most tribal nations are interested in collaborative research, but funding for such work is hard to come by, Gone said. So is funding for additional programs and services. Stephen O’Connor, who leads the suicide prevention research program at the Division of Services and Intervention Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said, “Given the crisis of suicide in Native American populations, we need more funding and continued sustained funding for research in this area.” Getting grants for scientific research from NIMH, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, can be challenging, especially for smaller tribes, he said. Officials at the NIMH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said that they continue to build research partnerships with tribal nations and that they recently launched new grants and multiple programs that are culturally informed and evidence-based to reduce suicide in tribal communities. NIMH researchers are even adjusting a commonly used suicide screening tool to incorporate more culturally appropriate language for Indigenous people. Teresa Brockie, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, is one of a small but growing number of researchers, many of whom are Indigenous, who study suicide prevention and intervention strategies that respect Indigenous beliefs and customs. Those strategies include smudging — the practice of burning medicinal plants to cleanse and connect people with their creator. Without this understanding, research is hampered because people in tribal communities have “universal mistrust of health care and other colonized systems that have not been helpful to our people or proven to be supportive,” said Brockie, a member of Fort Belknap Reservation’s Aaniiih Tribe. Brockie is leading [one of the first randomized controlled trials](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-12272-9) studying Indigenous people at Fort Peck. The project aims to reduce suicide risk by helping parents and caregivers deal with their own stress and trauma and develop positive coping skills. It’s also working to strengthen children’s tribal identity, connectivity, and spirituality. In 2015, she reported on a study she led in 2011 to collect suicide data at the Fort Peck reservation in northeastern Montana. She found that adverse childhood experiences [have a cumulative effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893815/) on suicide risk, and also that tribal identity, strong connections with friends and family, and staying in school were protective against suicide. In Arizona, Cwik is collaborating with the White Mountain Apache Tribe to help leaders there evaluate the impact of a comprehensive suicide surveillance system they created. So far, the program has [reduced the overall Apache suicide rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5105000/#:~:text=The%20overall%20Apache%20suicide%20death,35%20individuals%20(in%202012).) by 38.3% and the rate among young people ages 15 to 24 by 23%, according to the American Public Health Association. Several tribal communities are attempting to implement a similar system in their communities, said Cwik. Still, many tribal communities rely on limited mental health resources available through the Indian Health Service. One person at IHS is tasked with addressing suicide across almost 600 tribal nations. Pamela End of Horn, a social worker and national suicide prevention consultant at IHS, said the Department of Veterans Affairs “has a suicide coordinator in every medical center across the U.S., plus case managers, and they have an entire office dedicated to suicide prevention. In Indian Health Service it is just me and that’s it.” End of Horn, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, blames politics for the discrepancy. “Tribal leaders are pushing for more suicide prevention programs but lack political investment. The VA has strong proactive activities related to suicide and the backing of political leaders and veterans’ groups,” she said. It is also hard to get mental health professionals to work on remote reservations, while VA centers tend to be in larger cities. Even if more mental health services were available, they can be stigmatizing, re-traumatizing, and culturally incongruent for Indigenous people. Many states are using creative strategies to stop suicide. [A pilot project by the Rural Behavioral Health Institute](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/amid-dire-suicide-rates-in-montana-governor-expands-student-mental-health-screening/) screened more than 1,000 students in 10 Montana schools from 2020 to 2022. The governor of Montana is hoping to use state money to [expand mental health screening](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/17/amid-dire-suicide-rates-governor-expands-student-mental-health-screening/) for all schools. Experts say the kinds of strategies best suited to prevent suicide among Native Americans should deliver services that reflect their diversity, traditions, and cultural and language needs. That’s what Robert Coberly, 44, was searching for when he needed help. Coberly began having suicidal thoughts at 10 years old. “I was scared to live and scared to die. I just didn’t care,” said Coberly, who is a member of the Tulalip Tribes. RELATED [Amid dire suicide rates, governor expands student mental health screening](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/17/amid-dire-suicide-rates-governor-expands-student-mental-health-screening/) Gov. Gianforte announced he would use federal aid to expand mental health screening for students in the state, just two days after state lawmakers rejected a bill for the second time that would have done the same thing. He suffered in private for nearly a decade until he almost died in a car crash while driving drunk. After a stay at a rehabilitation center, Coberly remained stable. Years later, though, his suicidal thoughts came rushing back when one of his children died. He sought treatment at a behavioral health center where some of the therapists were Indigenous. They blended Western methodologies with Indigenous customs, which, he said, “I was craving and what I needed.” Part of his therapy included going to a sweat lodge for ritual steam baths as a means of purification and prayer. Coberly was a counselor for the Native and Strong Lifeline, the first [988 crisis line](https://988lifeline.org/current-events/the-lifeline-and-988/) for Indigenous people. He is now one of the crisis line tribal resource specialists connecting Indigenous people from Washington state with the resources they need. “It’s about time we had this line. To be able to connect people with resources and listen to them is something I can’t explain except that I was in a situation where I wanted someone to hear me and talk to,” Coberly said. Amanda MorningStar said she still worries about her son night and day, but he tries to reassure her. “I go to sleep and wake up the next day to keep it going,” Ben MorningStar said. “I only get one chance. I might as well make the best of it.” LATEST STORIES [Northwest addiction treatment centers will remain open after state inspections](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/01/25/northwest-addiction-treatment-centers-will-remain-open-after-state-inspections/) A company that operates 86 treatment beds between two addiction treatment centers in northwest Montana will stay open following state investigations into poor admissions practices, inadequate documentation of treatment plans and a failure to appropriately report serious incidents.

Some countries that supplied the weapons insist that they be used only on Ukrainian territory, the agency notes.\n“Ukraine’s offensive in the Kursk region is a heavy blow against the narrative of Russian President Putin,” Borel wrote in X, adding: “The removal of restrictions on the use of military force against the Russian army participating in the aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international right, would have several important effects,” including strengthening Ukrainian self-defense, saving lives, and advancing peace efforts, BTA reported.\n“The EU fully supports Ukraine’s fight against Russian aggression,” Borel emphasized.",

    "text": "Luas disformes e estranhas aparecem nos eclipses solares de Marte 28 Dez 2023 · Ciência Comentar\nPor várias vezes foi afirmado que a Terra é um planeta com sorte, pois ter a Lua tal como a temos é um privilégio. Até a vida depende dela. Contudo, não somos o único planeta que tem um satélite natural. Marte, por exemplo, tem dois, mas são muito estranhos. Ou será que a nossa Lua é que é perfeita demais?\nMarte tem duas pequenas luas chamadas Fobos e Deimos. O seu tamanho aparente não é suficientemente grande para cobrir o Sol, pelo que os eclipses marcianos nunca são totais, mas a sua forma é tão estranha que também não se parecem com anéis.\nFobos e os seus eclipses rápidos em Marte Com um raio de 11 km , Fobos é a maior lua de Marte. Orbita o planeta vermelho a uma distância de 6000 km, mais perto do que qualquer outro satélite natural conhecido, pelo que está condenada a colidir com o planeta dentro de alguns milhões de anos .\nEsta lua demora 7 horas e 39 minutos a orbitar Marte. Como um dia marciano dura 24 horas e 37 minutos, nasce e põe-se duas vezes por dia, e pode produzir dois eclipses por dia marciano . Ao mesmo tempo, a sua passagem é tão rápida que os seus eclipses não duram mais de trinta segundos para um observador do planeta.\nQuando Fobos passa entre o Sol e Marte, a sua forma irregular cobre grande parte do disco solar, mas como não o cobre completamente, os seus eclipses são chamados trânsitos. Os trânsitos de Fobos ocorrem algures em Marte na maioria dos dias do ano marciano (mas nunca nas latitudes mais elevadas).\nEstes acontecimentos rápidos projetam uma sombra alongada na superfície de Marte. A sombra não pode ser vista da Terra, mas tem sido observada em numerosas ocasiões com sondas espaciais e rovers de Marte.\nFobos, a estranha lua de Marte pic.twitter.com/IkXAFF19Sf\n— Pplware (@pplware) December 28, 2023\nJá na década de 70, a sonda Viking I da NASA detetou um escurecimento da luz causado pela sombra de Fobos. E na década de 1990, a Mars Global Surveyor fotografou a sua sombra em pormenor.\nEm 2004, o rover Opportunity observou vários eclipses a partir da superfície. Em 2019 e 2020, a sonda InSight detetou uma ligeira queda de luz no seu painel solar. E em 2022, o rover Perseverance captou um vídeo espetacular de um novo trânsito.\nDeimos provoca minúsculos eclipses\nDeimos é ainda mais pequeno (6,2 km de raio) e muito mais distante (23.460 km de Marte), pelo que mal é visível como uma mancha quando passa em frente ao Sol, que tem 10 vezes o seu diâmetro do ponto de vista de um observador marciano.\nMesmo assim, os rovers Opportunity e Spirit da NASA conseguiram captar vários trânsitos em 2004 e 2005, e a sonda InSight conseguiu detetar uma queda de luz de 0,9% quando Deimos transitou pelo Sol em 2020 durante cerca de dois minutos.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 29 (APP): The National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) on Friday temporarily sealed off the M14 motorway stretching from the Indus River to Yarik due to dense fog. The Motorway Police, taking proactive measures, aimed to avert potential accidents and safeguard the lives and belongings of motorway users, a public relations officer said while talking to APP. As the mist engulfs the thoroughfare, citizens are urged to exercise caution and limit unnecessary travel during foggy hours and a comprehensive guide issued by the Motorway Police to help navigate through the blanket of fog safely. To mitigate risks during this weather phenomenon, the Motorway Police advises citizens to conclude their journeys before the fog descends and daylight fades. This precautionary measure is pivotal in ensuring visibility on the road, reducing the likelihood of mishaps, he added. One of the key recommendations from the Motorway Police is the use of fog lights in vehicles. These specialized lights are designed to cut through the mist, providing enhanced visibility for drivers and minimizing the chances of collisions. Implementing this simple yet effective measure can make a significant difference in navigating through the fog-laden motorway. Drivers are reminded to avoid speeding and maintain a reasonable distance from the vehicle ahead. The reduced visibility demands a cautious approach, and adhering to speed limits can be the differentiator between a safe journey and a potential accident. Keeping a safe distance ensures adequate reaction time, allowing drivers to respond to unexpected situations promptly. NHMP authorities said that for real-time updates and information, the Motorway Police Helpline (130) is readily available for commuters. Before embarking on a journey, it’s advisable to seek the latest updates on road conditions, closures, and visibility from this helpline. Additionally, citizens can stay connected through the official social media accounts of the National Highways and Motorway Police for instant updates on the evolving situation. As the M14 motorway grapples with a veil of fog, the Motorway Police encourage responsible driving practices and urge citizens to prioritize safety. By adhering to these guidelines and staying informed through official channels, commuters can navigate through the misty challenges, ensuring a secure and uneventful journey on the motorway.",
