    "text": "Berlin: Workers at German factories for carmaker Volkswagen are to go on strike from Monday over plans to cut thousands of jobs, union IG Metall said at the weekend. \"If need be, it will be the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen,\" the union said on Sunday. The crisis-wracked auto titan has been locked in bitter talks with unions since announcing in September that it was mulling the unprecedented step of shuttering plants in Germany, where it has some 120,000 employees. VW has been hit hard by high manufacturing costs at home, a stuttering shift to electric vehicles and tough competition in key market China. Ahead of talks last month, the union and VW's works councils put forward a series of proposals they said would save 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in labour costs without the need for site closures. These included proposals for management and staff to waive bonuses. The union also said it could drop a demand for pay rises in exchange for working shorter hours at some factories. But Volkswagen said it had concluded that, while the measures could help in the short term, they would not lead \"to any long-term financial relief for the company in the coming years\". IG Metall at the time described VW's response as \"extremely regrettable\", accusing it of \"ignoring the constructive proposals of the employee representatives\".",

(CBS12) — The family of a man who died from an electric shock in a fountain at Harbourside Place two months ago filed suit against the establishment, requesting over $50,000 in damages.

We know how tough this tragedy is for this beautiful family and we pray for them during this time. Had Harbourside known there was an issue they would have moved immediately to fix it. Harbourside had no knowledge whatsoever that there was any problem with the fountain. We are confident that the true facts will become known during the legal process. In the over 70-page lawsuit, it states Harbourside Place had a \"non-delegable\" responsibility to keep its premises, including the grounds, building fountains, fixtures, electrical equipment and more in safe condition. The Town of Jupiter Building Department's investigation into the electrocution concluded light fixtures within the fountain were not kept up to proper standards. The town's case said some of the light fixtures within the \"electrified fountain\" were \" [leaking electrical voltage](https://cbs12.com/news/local/nate-davenport-harbourside-place-fountain-wire-dina-fleck-expert-richard-johnson-shares-view-why-electric-current-investigation-jupiter-town-building-department-florida-november-2-2023#).\" The directors, managers, supervisors or representatives at Harbourside Place should've been aware known of the hazardous state the fountain was in. Both Amy and her children suffered \"devastating mental pain, suffering, sorrow, grief and distress,\" the Davenport family's lawsuit said. The family will continue suffering the loss of Nate's \"companionship, love, guidance, support, services, instruction and protection\" for the \"remainder of their lives,\" the documents read.",

    "text": "Surviving in the startup world means\nhaving a unique and original idea that is well-executed with the help of all available resources. This is not an easy feat. That being said, new technology like ChatGPT is making the planning and ideation stage of creating a startup a bit easier.\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot with vast knowledge that can aid in developing startup ideas. However, it works best when provided with a specific prompt relevant to your goals. Before diving into detailed prompts, having a general idea of the technology space or problem you want to tackle is ideal.\nIf you are still exploring potential tech\nstartup concepts in general, you can begin by having ChatGPT generate a list of 10 varied technology startup ideas (or any number you specify). This gives you a starting point to choose a direction to refine further using more targeted prompts. Read on for examples of prompts you can enter into chat gpt to help generate your next tech startup idea.\nProblem-Solving ChatGPT Prompts For New Tech Startups\n- Industry Specific Problems: What are the major pain points in industries like healthcare, education, finance, or agriculture? How can technology address these challenges more efficiently?\n- Emerging Technologies: How can emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, augmented reality, or the Internet of Things (IoT) be applied to create innovative solutions in various fields?\n- Consumer Needs: What are some unmet needs or inconveniences faced by consumers in their daily lives? Can technology be used to simplify tasks, improve experiences, or save time for individuals?\n- Environmental Sustainability: How can technology be leveraged to promote sustainability and address environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon footprint, managing waste, or conserving resources?\n- Social Impact: What startup ideas can have a positive social impact, such as improving access to education, healthcare, or addressing social inequalities through technology-driven solutions?\n- Market Gaps: Are there underserved or overlooked markets that could benefit from tech solutions? This could involve niche industries or demographics that lack specialized products or services.\n- Collaborative Platforms: How can technology facilitate collaboration, communication, or connection among people, businesses, or communities? Think about platforms that foster interaction and mutual benefit.\n- Personalized Experiences: Can technology be used to provide highly personalized experiences in areas like entertainment, shopping, travel, or fitness, catering to individual preferences and needs?\n- Workplace Efficiency: How can technology optimize productivity, streamline workflows, or enhance remote work experiences for businesses and their employees?\n- Cultural Trends: What are the current cultural trends or shifts, and how can technology adapt or capitalize on these trends to create innovative products or services?\nMixing and matching these prompts or combining different angles can often lead to fresh and promising startup ideas. After generating these ideas, ChatGPT advises to “Conduct thorough market research, validate the idea and consider the feasibility and scalability of the proposed solution before diving in.” This is good advice as the free version of the chatbot is almost two years behind on information, meaning it does not have the accuracy on the current state of the targeted market. However, there is still information ChatGPT can provide that is still useful for creating a startup today.",

    "text": "“山东、山西、河北、河南”这四个省份是出了名的高考大省，这几个省份的考生高考的“难”不仅仅体现在人数多，更体现在高等教育资源相对稀缺上，以江西为例， 作为山河四省之一，江西本省只有一所211高校，但这还不是最难的，更难的还在后面。\n江西省的高考题目也是出了名的“难”，“难”到什么程度呢？ 别的地区的考生参加完高考，最多是吐槽1—2科目考试比较难，如果被吐槽难的科目超过3科那都算是罕见了，而江西考生几乎是“考完一门骂一门”，因为都很难！\n除了语数外这三大主科之外，江西高考的其他科目都采用江西自命题试卷，难度的确比较高， 本以为今年的分数线会有所下降，可结果却令考生感到很崩溃。\n2025江西高考分数线公布，本科线“全国最高”\n今年江西历史类普通本科线高达486分，特控线更是达到539分；物理类普通本科线为429分，特控线为505分， 这样的分数线一经发布就遭到了江西考生的吐槽，尤其是历史类486分的分时线，更是创下了“全国最高”的记录，要知道同样是高考大省，河南的历史类本科线也不过才471分。\n预期的结果与期待中的截然不同， 这也是很多江西考生感到崩溃的原因，哪怕只是几分的浮动，也能在无形之中影响着成千上万考生的命运，尤其是那些在本科线徘徊的考生，原本差一点就能上本科了，结果却因为一点微妙的差距与本科无缘，这样的结果着实令人心酸。\n江西高考分数线居高不下已经成为常态， 而今年历史类本科线比去年上涨了23分 ，这23分的上涨，对于文科生来说影响巨大。\n在其他省份考500分左右已经能上一本院校，而在江西却只能上二本； 在其他省份考到甚至可以稳进重点大学，但在江西却连一本都不稳，网友们形容江西高考：“用微薄的教育资源滋养出高难度的试卷，然后去卷最高的分数线。”\n作为教育类工作者，笔者近期查阅了不少省份的分数线和考生分数分布情况， 感受最多的是无奈与心酸， 在围观了许多个家庭查分的视频后，这种心情更加强烈。\n有的考生因为比预估分数少了40分而眼含泪光，不敢告诉父母实情， 而父母第一时间选择的不是责备，而是安慰；有考生考了200多分，家长的第一反应是“还好起码能上大专”，而有的考生则因为考了500多分，遭到了家长的冷脸和批评。\n高分数线是挑战也是机遇，江西学子们：加油！\n而在看到江西省的分数线后， 笔者仿佛已经透过屏幕看到了许多个家庭深深的无奈， 这些藏在分数背后的喜怒哀乐，那些因为教育资源分配不均而造成的“同分不同命”，令人既无奈又心酸。\n对于江西考生来说，高分数线虽然是学习能力和生源资料的证明， 但这也同时意味着江西学生要付出更多的努力，才能有希望获得与其他省份同学同等的教育机会， 而在本省高等教育资源匮乏的情况下，又有许多江西学生即便舍不得家乡，也不得不为了更好的读书机会奔走他乡。\n高分数线是挑战也是机遇， 我们不歌颂困难，但当困难摆在面前，与其自怨自艾，不如正视挑战背后的机遇，江西高考的高难度培养了学生的学习能力和抗压能力，这些对于江西学子而言，在今后无论是学习还是工作中，都会成为他们奋斗路上最宝贵的财富。\n高考不仅是知识的测试，也是意志的考验，江西学子通过自己的努力，证明了他们的实力和韧性，即使面对全国最高的分数线， 江西学子也无需过度焦虑，保持信心，才能才能在这场人生大考中取得真正的成功。 江西学子，加油！\n今日话题：你如何看待这件事呢？\n（所有图片均来源于网络，如有侵权，请联系删除）",

    "title": "Le tunnel Boring Co. d'Elon Musk à Las Vegas est un exemple effrayant de ce qui nous attend",
    "text": "Elon Musk Boring Company a creusé un tunnel de 1,7 mile sous les rues de Las Vegas qui est censé offrir un moyen propre de nettoyer le trafic à Sin City. Depuis son ouverture, Le tunnel a suscité des critiques pour ses coûts de construction élevés et son nombre de passagers relativement faible par rapport aux systèmes de transport en commun traditionnels comme les trains et le métro. Maintenant, l’entreprise derrière tout cela a été accusé d’avoir contourné les « réglementations en matière de construction, d’environnement et de travail », en raison d’un manque de surveillance sur le projet.\nMusk Boring Company a présenté son programme de tunnels dans une poignée de villes à travers l’Amérique, y compris dans des États comme la Californie et l’Illinois. C’était Le Nevada qui a finalement sauté le pas sur le projet et avec le soutien du secteur privé par l’intermédiaire de la Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, les travaux ont commencé sur une section de 0,8 mile du tunnel qui a été achevée en 2019. Une extension ouverte en 2020 a porté la distance totale que vous pouviez parcourir sous les rues de Vegas à 1,7 mile.\nL’office du tourisme de Vegas souhaite désormais étendre le service jusqu’à 68 miles de tunnels, comprenant plus de 100 stations sur le réseau, ce qui en ferait une sorte de système de métro extrêmement inefficace. À titre de comparaison, la boucle de Vegas peut gérer environ 4 000 passagers par heure traversant les tunnels dans les voitures Tesla, comparé aux 10 000 passagers par heure qui Ligne de métro Victoria de Londres peut gérer une journée moyenne.\nLe projet pourrait être décevant pour les fans de transport en commun, mais il est peu probable qu’il soit confronté à des questions sur son avenir, car il est pratiquement exempté de la surveillance gouvernementale. C’est parce qu’il a été approuvé, financé et exploité par une entreprise privée, offrant un aperçu de l’avenir qui Le patron de l’entreprise Elon Musk veut pour les États-Unis.\nÉtant donné que le tunnel de Vegas a été soutenu par l’office privé du tourisme de Vegas, il est exempté des scrutateurs fédéraux qui peuvent critiquer sa construction et son fonctionnement. Rapports de ProPublica. Pour cette raison, la Boring Company a adopté une approche de « demander pardon, et non la permission » pour son tunneling, comme l’explique le site :\nEntre-temps, Boring a contourné les réglementations en matière de construction, d’environnement et de travail, selon les documents obtenus par ProPublica et CityCast Las Vegas en vertu des lois sur les documents publics.\nElle a installé à deux reprises des tunnels sans permis de travail sur des propriétés du comté. Les régulateurs environnementaux de l’État et locaux ont documenté le déversement d’eau non traitée dans les égouts pluviaux et le réseau d’égouts. Et, alors que les politiciens locaux approuvaient une extension du système, les ouvriers de Boring déposaient des plaintes avec l’Administration de la sécurité et de la santé au travail de l’État au sujet de l’eau « jusqu’aux chevilles » dans les tunnels, des déversements de boues et de graves brûlures chimiques. Après une enquête, l’OSHA du Nevada en 2023 a infligé à l’entreprise une amende de plus 112 000 $. Boring a contesté les allégations des régulateurs et contesté les violations.\nL’année dernière, des images vidéo ont fait surface en ligne montrant de l’eau se déversant sur une propriété de la Boring Company et, bien que la société ait déclaré qu’elle « travaillait à corriger ce qui se passait », un déversement similaire a été documenté moins de trois mois plus tard. manque de réponse de la part de Boring Co Cela a conduit à des appels à la révocation des permis de construire, car « les sanctions financières n’auraient aucun effet sur les résultats de l’entreprise », ajoute ProPublica.\nLe mépris de l’environnement est une chose, mais ProPublica suggère également un manque de prendre soin des employés de Boring Company et les passagers. L’entreprise aurait pris des mesures pour réduire encore la surveillance en demandant une exemption des permis qui régissent l’exploitation de projets similaires de voyage et de tourisme, comme l’explique le site :\nAlors que Boring commence à transporter des passagers au-delà du centre des congrès dans le cadre du tout premier test d’un réseau routier souterrain utilisant des Tesla conduites par un conducteur, il a réussi à supprimer une autre couche de surveillance du comté. L’année dernière, Boring a demandé au comté de ne plus l’obliger à détenir un permis spécial qui, entre autres, oblige les exploitants de systèmes de divertissement et de transport privés à signaler les blessures graves et les décès, et accorde au comté une autorité supplémentaire pour inspecter et réglementer leurs opérations afin de protéger la sécurité publique.\nLe résultat est que les questions clés sur le fonctionnement et l’entretien d’un système de transport non prouvé restent sans réponse. Le comté a refusé de répondre aux questions détaillées sur son rôle de surveillance depuis l’expiration du permis spécial. Il a fourni une déclaration indiquant que Boring est « responsable du fonctionnement sûr de son système et de retenir les services d’un professionnel de conception tiers agréé au Nevada pour effectuer des audits annuels de ses opérations. Le comté peut examiner ces audits et inspecter le système « comme il le juge approprié. »\nEn conséquence, les experts de Las Vegas ont qualifié l’infini extension de la Boring Company réseau de tunnels en question. Ils affirment que le système devrait être tenu aux mêmes normes que les autres systèmes de transport en commun de l’État, surtout après avoir reçu tant de citations pour des travaux de construction et de travail au cours de sa courte existence.\nCe qui est alarmant, c’est que les efforts de Musk pour contourner la réglementation et la surveillance gouvernementale à Las Vegas offrent un avant-goût de ce qu’il espère accomplir au niveau fédéral dans les années à venir. un rôle de conseiller imminent auprès de Trump administration sur les cartes, ProPublica avertit que Les coupes dans les réglementations et la surveillance gouvernementale pourraient signifier que le fiasco de Vegas est un signe de ce qui va arriver pour les infrastructures américaines.\nCe contenu a été traduit automatiquement à partir du texte original.
