    "text": "NEEDHAM, Mass. (WHDH) – A woman in Massachusetts is celebrating her 113th birthday.\nThe reason she gave for making it so long may be surprising.\nAt 113 years old, Herlda Senhouse may be the oldest resident in Massachusetts.\nThe centenarian was born the same year as Lucille Ball and Ronald Reagan. The president at the time was William Howard Taft. It was also the year construction began on Fenway Park in Boston.\nDuring her birthday celebration, Senhouse was surrounded by loved ones at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Needham. She was honored with a special cane given to the oldest resident of her hometown in Wellesley.\nSenhouse’s friend, Margaret Robinson, was there to help celebrate.\n“She’s a lovely person and very kind, very giving, very inspirational, absolutely a wonderful person,” Robinson said.\nSenhouse was born in West Virginia before she moved to Massachusetts at a young age.\n“I’m so happy. It’s awesome,” she said.\nA fan of the slot machines, Senhouse said she is looking forward to her next trip to the casino.\nSenhouse said she credits living a more stress-free life as the reason for her longevity.\n“I didn’t have children,” she said.\nCopyright 2024 WHDH via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "Guest Post by [Martin Armstrong](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/world-news/war/americans-have-invaded-kursk-inside-russia/) [Last June, Biden lifted the ban on American contractors sending mercenaries into Ukraine. When he lifted the ban on American weapons, allowing them to be deployed inside Russia, this was another step that de facto allowed these private American military operations to invade Russia pretending it is not the official United States. I have warned that the Neocons are scared to death of Trump, and if RFK joins Trump as the Attorney General, as I have been arguing behind the curtain, they are desperate to start World War III before the election.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine/index.html) Sources are reporting that Stephanie Holmes, the US Chargé d’Affaires in Russia, was summoned to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain why Americans have invaded Russia with the invasion of the Ukrainian Army into the Kursk region. By 2008, the US Department of Defense employed 155,826 private contractors in Iraq — and 152,275 troops. This degree of privatization is unprecedented in modern warfare. The Neocons used Biden to circumvent Congress to create World War III, deploying private armies to negate Congressional approval. Indeed, Russia has an opportunity to now annihilate the entire invading force, including Americans, by deploying a small tactical nuclear weapon inside its own borders. Nobody can say anything about that, and Russia would be within its right to do so just as if Chinese, Russian, or North Korean private military invaded the United States. September has been a significant target on our computer all year for civil unrest and international war. Gold’s performance appears linked to this action, whereas silver and platinum have not responded. While gold may peak by next week, September remains a major Panic Cycle in many markets, including gold. Russia is certainly within its right to use whatever means necessary to eradicate this invading force. If it does not respond on its own territory, then it would only invite a full-scale NATO invasion. These Neocons are traitors to the United States and the future of our nation, all for their personal hatred of Russians. It is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site with the best unbiased information available, and a forum where it can be discussed openly, as our Founders intended.

    "text": "Kochi: Heavy rains that lashed the city on Thursday noon caused waterlogging at several places. However, as the rain started to subside in the afternoon, water receded from all such points, thereby easing the difficulties caused to the public.Many parts of MG Road, including Pallimukku and Shenoy’s Junction, got inundated in the rains. “The rain subsided after almost an hour. This helped in avoiding flooding in the city. But many places in the city, especially MG Road, faced moderate waterlogging for almost an hour,” said K S Dileep Kumar, president of Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi, an NGO.Meanwhile, the city corporation’s opposition councillors said the recent rains did not worsen the waterlogging situation in the city, as the showers were brief and intermittent. “In most cases it rained during low tide. This helped to avoid a situation where the entire city got flooded,” said M G Aristotle, councillor from Kathrikkadavu. “Desilting of major canals like Thevara-Perandoor has not been completed so far. The Ombudsman for local bodies had asked the corporation to complete desilting of the mouths of Thevara-Perandoor canals by Aug. Moreover, a project started in 2018 to beautify the canals still remains incomplete,” Aristotle said. “The culverts across the city's railway lines have not been desilted either,” he said.However, corporation secretary Chelsa Sini refused to comment on the measures taken by the local body to contain waterlogging.District collector NSK Umesh said there has been some let-up in the rains since Thursday afternoon. “The water levels in Periyar, Muvattupuzhayar, and Chalakkudy rivers are receding. So, no rain-related calamities were reported from any part of the district ,” Umesh said.We also published the following articles recentlyIMD issues red alert for Delhi NCR after heavy rains, waterlogging at several placesThe India Meteorological Department issued a red alert for Delhi and NCR due to heavy rainfall, causing significant traffic congestion and flight diversions.

    "text": "В СНБО \"поздравили\" государство-агрессора с \"днем России\"\nВ четверг, 12 июня, россияне отмечают день своего \"великого государства\". Правда, для празднования поводов мало, ведь диктатор Путин ведет свой народ не к \"светлому будущему\", а к тотальному упадку.\nВ СНБО «поздравили» государство-агрессора с «днем России». Там указали на колоссальные потери РФ в войне против Украины.\nОб этом сообщает руководитель ЦПД СНБО Андрей Коваленко.\n«Миллион потерь россиян в войне с Украиной. Вот такое стремление народа России к светлому будущему. С днем», — написал он.\nРанее генерал армии Николай Маломуж объяснил, как принудить РФ и Путина к миру. Прежде Украине нужно предоставить: 10 тысяч стратегических и тактических ракет большой дальности Tomahawk; несколько тысяч тактических баллистических ракет ATACMS; тысячи самолетов, БМП M2 Bradley и танков Leopard; РЭБ, глушащие баллистические ракеты и дроны любых типов и миллионы боеприпасов.\nНе менее важный элемент — экономическое давление на российскую элиту. В частности, речь идет и о семье Путина, поскольку только финансовые санкции имеют 58 закрытых позиций.\nА так называемые «адские» санкции в отношении энергетики должны оказать влияние на российские нефть и газ, и, как следствие, под лидерством США Европа и Китай будут строить новый мировой порядок.",
