    "title": "Homan scores a win during 100th international cap at 2025 LGT World Women's Curling Championship",
    "text": "UIJEONGBU, SOUTH KOREA — Rachel Homan’s latest win at the 2025 LGT World Women’s Curling Championship was significant for a couple of reasons.\nThe 8-6 win against Norway’s Team Marianne Roervik (4-5) elevated Canada to 6-2 in the standings and kept its share of third place in the 13-team field at Uijeongbu Arena. It was also Homan’s 100th game representing Canada on the international curling scene.\nHoman, vice-skip Tracy Fleury, second Emma Miskew, lead Sarah Wilkes, alternate Rachelle Brown and national coaches Viktor Kjell and Renée Sonnenberg earned the win in the 10th end with an open hit for two on Wednesday night.\n“Really important. We couldn’t drop that loss for sure. We’ve got a big game against Switzerland tomorrow morning. We just didn’t capitalize on our opportunities and the game was real close,” Homan said.\nCanada started the game with an early lead and maintained control through the middle ends, but Norway developed a late-game surge that put Team Homan’s win at risk.\nTrailing by three, Norway capitalized in the eighth end after Canada’s attempt at a corner freeze to create a stagger landed on the nose instead. This left a straight-back angle, giving Norway a short runback for two points, narrowing the gap to just one.\nTeam Roervik tied the game in the ninth end after fourth Kristin Skaslien executed an exceptional tapback through a narrow port to sit one. Canada attempted a slash for two but missed wide, allowing Norway to score and even the match.\nHoman earned her 80th win in 100 international games played and ranks second behind Jennifer Jones (112 games played, 87 wins) among able-bodies Canadian women’s curlers.\nCanadian wheelchair curler Ina Forrest has the most Canadian caps among women’s curlers, with 204 games played at World Wheelchair Championship events and Paralympic Games.\nThe 35-year-old skip made her debut representing Canada at the 2010 World Junior Curling Championships, winning silver. Now, she’s competing at the World Women’s Curling Championship for the fifth time in her career, having already earned two golds, one silver, and one bronze at the event. Homan has also represented Canada at the Olympic Winter Games twice — in women’s curling in 2018 and in mixed doubles in 2022 — and earlier this season, she added a Pan Continental Curling Championship gold to her accomplishments.\n“Look at that. If only I was 100-0,” Homan joked. “I’m always happy to represent Canada and I’m glad I’ve been able to play that many games for Canada.”\nCanada had an unconventional force in a first end that featured just about everything. It started when Miskew’s takeout picked and took a 90-degree turn to the boards. Later, Canada attempted a takeout to sit two, but jammed on a stone behind the house, leaving a Norway stone in play. Norway missed its final two shots, first a flashed takeout and then stuck around on the blank attempt for a single point.\nIn the second end, Team Homan had several counters on the wings but couldn’t get them into play due to a well-placed draw by Norway. Canada took a single, but then stole three in the third. Homan nailed a hit-and-roll behind cover and forced Norway into a difficult come around. Team Roervik was light and over-curled, wrecking on the front Canadian counter.\nCanada maintained firm control throughout much of the game and didn’t need to take risks. They scored single points in the fifth and seventh ends while holding Norway to just one point in both the fourth and sixth ends.\nTeam Homan plays its last of three straight split days in South Korea on Thursday. First, it takes on undefeated Team Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland (8-0) on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. (all times ET), followed by a game against Japan’s Team Sayaka Yoshimura (3-5) at 6 a.m. on Thursday.\nIn other Draw 14 games, China’s Team Rui Wang (5-3) earned an 8-2 win against Lithuania’s Team Virginija Paulauskaite (0-9); Sweden’s Team Anna Hasselborg (6-2) defeated Italy’s Team Stefania Constantini (3-6) with a 7-6 win; and Scotland’s Team Sophie Jackson (5-4) improved with a 6-5 win against Japan’s Team Yoshimura.\nFor Team Canada updates, go to www.curling.ca.
