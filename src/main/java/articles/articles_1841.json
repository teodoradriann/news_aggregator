    "title": "Biden administration sanctions ‘extremist’ Israeli settlers in West Bank – Daily Montanan",
    "text": "President Joe Biden sanctioned four Israeli settlers in the West Bank on Thursday, part of an administration effort to curb civilian casualties in the region as Israel’s war with Hamas continues. Biden signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/01/executive-order-on-imposing-certain-sanctions-on-persons-undermining-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) authorizing financial sanctions that can be applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who engage in acts of violence on the West Bank, a Palestinian territory on the Jordan River occupied by Israel. But the first four individuals designated under the order were Israeli settlers accused of violence against Palestinians and Biden made clear “extremist settler violence” motivated the move. “I have issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to deal with the threat posed by the situation in the West Bank, including in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction,” he wrote in a message to Congress accompanying the order. “Such actions constitute a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region and undermine the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States,” Biden continued. The United States supports a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, which settler activity in the West Bank threatens, he said. Violence in the area also threatens Israeli security and U.S. personnel and interests and could lead to “broader regional destabilization,” he wrote. Freeze on U.S.-based assets The order is similar to other sanctions that aim to block access to the U.S. financial system, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. Two senior administration officials briefed reporters on details of the order Thursday on the condition they not be named. The order freezes any U.S.-based assets of designated individuals and blocks anyone in the U.S. from sending money or other services to the listed individuals. An initial State Department [ list](https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-further-measures-to-promote-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) Thursday named four Israeli settlers who were subject to the sanctions. The State Department accused the individuals of inciting and leading a riot, which caused the death of a Palestinian civilian, assaulting Palestinian farmers and Israeli peace activists, and “creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank.” White House Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to a Biden campaign event in Michigan that the order was part of a longstanding commitment to peace in the region. “It’s a signal to the whole world how seriously President Biden takes this settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank,” Kirby said, according to audio provided by the White House press pool. “He’s been very, very clear on that for a long, long time. It’s got to stop. It’s unacceptable. It’s a detriment to peace and security, certainly there in the West Bank and to the Palestinian people in general.” Israeli government officials were given advance notice of the order, Kirby said. Government officials are not intended targets of sanctions, Kirby said. Pressure from progressives The order comes amid pressure from progressive activists for the Biden administration to work to end the war that erupted after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. While Biden administration officials have affirmed Israel’s right to respond to the attack, they have increasingly demanded more attention to minimizing civilian casualties. “Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a [Thursday news release](https://www.state.gov/further-measures-to-promote-peace-security-and-stability-in-the-west-bank/) on the sanctions. “The United States will continue to take actions to advance the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution, and is committed to the safety, security, and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.” While the initial targets of the order were Israeli, a senior administration on the press call said the order is “non-discriminatory” and could be applied to “Israelis and Palestinians alike.”",

    "text": "The relocation and expansion of a farm in [Russell County](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/russell-county/) will result in a nearly $1 million investment that will create 12 new jobs. [Bates Family Farm](https://www.batesfamilyfarmllc.com/28/our-story.htm) will relocate its manufacturing facility to a 40,000 square foot building owned by Russell County to meet the growing consumer demand for its skincare products. The space should allow for the development of new products, additional production capacity and warehouse space. Bates Family Farm will also construct a new creamery to produce food products, bottled goat milk and artisan cheeses, for wholesale and retail distribution. The farm is committed to purchasing 100 percent of all expected agricultural products from Virginia, an increase of more than $2 million over the next three years as a result of this expansion. “I am pleased to see this AFID award assist in the relocation and expansion of Bates Family Farm, a Virginia home-grown, agricultural business, founded by one of our country’s veterans,” said Virginia Gov. [Glenn Youngkin](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/glenn-youngkin/). “This project increases economic development activity in Russell County, provides new jobs in a rural area, and demonstrates our support of the Commonwealth’s dairy industry and to Virginia’s entire agricultural community.” Shannon and Joseph Bates established Bates Family Farm in Russell County in 2013. The company produces a full line of goat milk-based skincare products to include soap, lotion, lip balm and body cream, that are sold in more than 1,000 retail stores and specialty shops across the U.S. “This AFID grant award and the support we have received from Russell County are critical factors in our decision to move forward with this project. We are honored to grow our business in the county we call home and be part of Virginia’s agricultural community,” said Bates Family Farm CEO Joseph Bates. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services worked with Russell County and the Russell County Industrial Development Authority to secure the project for the Commonwealth. Youngkin approved a $70,000 grant from the Governor’s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development Fund, which Russell County will match with local funds. “Russell County is committed to continuing to focus on agribusiness as a growing and vital part of our local economy. This project will not only create jobs and investment in the county, but also grow the business’ contributions to local tax revenues,” said Russell County Industrial Development Authority Executive Director Ernie McFaddin.",

    "text": "Conservationists in Cambodia have made a groundbreaking discovery by finding 106 eggs of the rare Siamese crocodile species in a wildlife sanctuary in western Cambodia. This is the largest such discovery in the past 20 years, offering renewed hope for the survival of one of the world's rarest crocodile species in the wild.The eggs were found in Cardamom National Park in May, and by the end of June, 60 of them had successfully hatched, according to a joint statement from the ministries of agriculture and environment, along with the conservation group Fauna & Flora.'This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for wild crocodiles, providing hope for the species' recovery,' the statement said.The young reptiles are currently under the protection of Cardamom National Park Wildlife Sanctuary rangers. The Siamese crocodile was once widespread across Southeast Asia but has been listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. By the 1990s, the species had nearly vanished due to poaching, habitat destruction, and crossbreeding with other crocodile species.Cambodian Environment Minister Eang Sophalleth emphasized ongoing efforts in conservation and habitat restoration. 'The Siamese crocodiles play an important role in the ecosystem, and the discovery of the five nests successfully hatching 60 eggs reflects that the Cardamom National Park is a safe and suitable habitat for this species,' Sophalleth said.Currently, it is believed that only about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles remain in the wild, with more than 300 of them residing in Cambodia. Past finds, such as six eggs in 2017 and eight hatchlings in 2021, have also contributed to ongoing conservation efforts.(With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "Northern lights put on dazzling display in Maine, which could see aurora borealis again very soon Maine residents were treated to a breathtaking display of northern lights Thursday night, with vibrant colors filling the skies across the state. The event was triggered by a rare and severe geomagnetic storm, which was the result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) of plasma from the sun. According to the Space Weather Prediction Center, the burst of energy came off of the sun Tuesday, raced toward Earth and arrived in the atmosphere on Thursday. Experts say the northern lights occur when solar particles collide with oxygen and nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere, causing the air to glow. The different colors appear at varying altitudes, with green auroras typically occurring about 150 miles above the surface and pink hues forming around 60 miles up. Reactions from atomized oxygen particles create the green colors, while reactions from ionized molecular nitrogen create the blue and purple colors at lower altitudes. Thursday night's aurora borealis was visible across much of the northern half of the United States and as far south as Alabama in the East to northern California in the West. Mainers could be treated to another aurora very soon, as forecasters predict another northern lights show may happen Friday. Go through the photo gallery below to see even more photos of the northern lights in Maine from Thursday night.",

There was a lot of blood.\n‘He brought him to shore but I think it was too late by then.’\nEmergency services tried desperately to save the teen but his injuries were unsurvivable.\nFriends have paid tribute to the youngster online, with one posting on social media: ‘Fly high Kai – lots of love and missing you already’.\nHis aunt Lauryn Barley has now set up a GoFundMe appeal to raise funds for the family in the wake of the tragedy.\n‘Our beloved Khai was suddenly taken from us by a white pointer while surfing at Ethel Wreck off the coast of Yorke Penisula,’ she posted.\n‘I’m here to try help raise funds for my sister, Kate and brother, Tim to cover the cost of the funeral service.’\nA family friend added: ‘Life can change in a second and we are never prepared.\n‘Our friend’s son and grandson Khai died yesterday in a shark attack which has not only rocked a family yet a whole community.\n‘As a community we come together and this is one way we can support this family right now.
