    "text": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin commissioned a study in 2021 following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, in which several active duty military and veterans participated, to gain better insight into the breadth of the problem,\naccording to a memo.\nHowever, the study, based on interviews with more than 100 defense officials and experts, government studies, articles, and preexisting data, was completed in mid-2022, and found something he didn’t expect. It\nfound that DOD, despite two years of work, has failed to understand domestic extremism and may have inflated the issue to the possible detriment of cohesion within the ranks.\n“May have?”\nAs if we didn’t know, it\ndamages the cohesiveness of the soldiers.\n“In the absence of a clear and consistent message, there is a risk that misinterpretations could lead to a significant division in the force along political and ideological lines, with some members of the military believing that they are being targeted for their views” the authors\n wrote.\nThey “found reason to believe that the risk to the military from widespread polarization and division in the ranks may be a greater risk than the radicalization of a few service members.”\nAustin said they’ll follow the recommendations but added: “The vast majority of those who serve in uniform and their civilian colleagues do so with great honor and integrity, but any extremist behavior in the force can have an outsized impact. We shall adhere to our core beliefs and values and reaffirm the oaths we each took to uphold and support the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. This is the greatest fighting force the world has known, and we will ensure it remains exactly that.”\nWHITE RAGE AND PRONOUNS\nIn other words, nothing has changed really. The soldiers will still have to watch their pronouns or be pegged as extremists. Austin will still talk about imaginary “white rage,” and normal white males will be targeted as potential domestic terrorists.\n-\n[The Importance of Prayer: How a Christian Gold Company Stands Out by Defending Americans’ Retirement]( https://www.independentsentinel.com/the-importance-of-prayer-how-a-christian-gold-company-stands-out-by-defending-americans-retirement//)\nThe military has to undergo\n mandatory pronoun training, which is insane. Austin is also foisting full CRT training on them.\nAustin targeted Trump supporters as domestic terrorists, continually referring to J6. He also spent time and tax money renaming bases and taking down at least one historical statue.",

    "text": "The richest woman in the world, L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, just became the [first woman to amass a $100 billion fortune](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-28/l-oreal-heir-francoise-bettencourt-meyers-is-first-woman-to-hit-100-billion), according to a report published Thursday by Bloomberg. The milestone marks a successful year for the L’Oreal company with its stock at a record-high, [bringing Bettencourt Meyers’ net worth to $100.2 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/investing/francoise-bettencourt-meyers-100-billion-loreal/index.html), as measured by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bettencourt Meyers, 70, is the only child of Liliane Bettencourt, whose father, Eugène Schueller, founded L’Oréal. She inherited her mother’s holdings when Bettencourt died in 2017. She now holds over 34% of the company’s stock and serves as the chairwoman of the family’s holding company, Tethys, as well as the vice chairwoman of L’Oreal Group’s board of directors. Already standing as the world’s largest cosmetics company, L’Oreal’s stock rose 35% this year, [its best year since 1998](https://www.afr.com/world/europe/l-oreal-heir-becomes-first-woman-with-us100b-fortune-20231229-p5eu3x), as spending on luxury goods has continued to increase since the pandemic. With a large portfolio of brands ranging from Lancôme to Maybelline, the L’Oreal Group did more than $42 billion (€38 billion) in sales in 2022, per company reports. Back in August, L’Oreal purchased Australian cosmetics brand Aesop for $2.5 billion — the largest brand acquisition ever completed by the company, according to financial markets platform Dealogic. Bettencourt Meyers now ranks as the 12th richest person in the world, directly behind Carlos Slim, a Mexican business magnate who became the first Latin American to cross the $100 billion threshold on Dec. 14. Tech billionaire and X owner Elon Musk [still sits atop the list, with a net worth estimated at around $240 billion](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#32cb38ba3d78), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s followed by Bernard Arnault, the chair of luxury goods maker LVMH (the conglomerate behind Louis Vuitton), who comes in at around $180 billion.",
