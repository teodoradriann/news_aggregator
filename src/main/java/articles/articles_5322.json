Hector courageously confessed that he assumed his role not for the sake of a job or promotion but because he personally witnessed the suffering caused by drug addiction in his own family and community. Hector also highlighted the high profitability of the drug trade, in which one kilo of 90% pure heroin bought for $250,000 can be broken down into ten kilos for distribution, maximizing profit. Despite the risk to his life, he continues to combat drug cartels, criticizing the Mexican government's inadequate response and warning that the glamorization of drug lords in songs and movies influences others to aspire to be drug dealers. The desperation for a better life often drives people into drug dealing, consequently contributing to the continuous drug crisis.

    "title": "Is it a bird, a plane? No, it’s the moon! Toronto scientist explains the phenomenon of Thursday’s supermoon",
    "text": "Look up tonight, Toronto! Tonight’s supermoon will be the biggest and brightest full moon of the year.\nReferred to as the Hunter’s Moon, the full moon is set to dazzle the autumn skies at sunset. The common phenomenon has started a social media frenzy, with many in awe of how close the moon has appeared over the past few days.\nOn Thursday, the moon is expected to peak at its fullest, and a Toronto scientist gives insight on the spatial spectacle.\nWHAT IS A SUPERMOON? Humber Polytechnic educational developer and planetary scientist, Dr. Sara Mazrouei, says that a supermoon occurs when a full moon is at its closest point to Earth during its orbit. At its closest, the moon appears to be around 14 per cent larger in the sky.\n“The moon’s orbit around the Earth is not a perfect circle, it’s an ellipse. So, at some points, it comes a little bit closer to the earth, and at some point it’s a little bit further,” Mazrouei explained to Now Toronto on Thursday.\n“But when it comes at its closest to the Earth, it’s called the point of perigee, and if that happens to be when the moon is also at a full moon, we call that a supermoon.”\nMazrouei says this Hunter’s Moon is special compared to previous years, as the last time the moon was recorded to be as bright as it will be was 17 years ago.\nHOW COMMON IS THE SUPERMOON? Though the interest in supermoons seems to be becoming more popular, Mazrouei says the phenomenon is quite common. In fact, this supermoon marks the third of four consecutive supermoons this year, she says. However, she notes that each one once served historical purposes.\n“They do happen multiple times a year, and each one has a different significance,” she said.\n“The last one we had was the Harvest Moon, which happens around harvest time. This one is called Hunter’s Moon, because in the older times it was said to provide a little bit more light for hunting and getting ready for the winter. So, it’s sort of signifying different times of the year.”\nThe next one after Thursday is expected on November 15, and is referred to as the Beaver Supermoon. There are different interpretations for the meaning of the name; one is that mid-fall was the time for Indigenous tribes to set beaver traps before the swamps freeze to ensure a supply of warm winter furs, according to NASA . Another interpretation suggests that the name Beaver Moon came from how active the beavers are during the season as they prepare for winter.\n WHAT TIME WILL THE SUPERMOON BE SEEN? Mazrouei says the moon actually peaked at its fullness at 7:26 a.m. on Thursday. But non-early risers still have a chance to catch it at sunset, or moonrise, tonight. She encourages viewers to look toward the horizon at around 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.",

    "text": "Marin County sees evacuation orders lifted in some areas In Marin County, evacuation orders have been canceled for areas around Stinson Beach. Earlier Thursday, some communities near the beach were told to be ready to go due to high surf and storm surge.\nSANTA CRUZ, Calif. - The Bay Area&apos;s beach towns got hammered on Thursday as high surf and storm surges ravaged the coastline.\nAround Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar State Beach in Santa Cruz, logs littered the sandy coast and onlookers sat on perches witnessing Mother Nature in action.\nIn addition, West Cliff in Santa Cruz was also closed between Columbia and David Way. The iconic road is still being repaired from last year&apos;s storms.\nMeanwhile, in Pacifica, a pair of crab fishers arrived at Linda Mar Beach and then turned around to go home.\n\"Apparently, that&apos;s not going to happen,\" Paul Gonzales said. \"But the pier&apos;s closed. These waves are outrageous.\"\nSteve Ramirez sighed and said: \"We&apos;re just going to pack up.\"\nHigh surf warnings and advisories are in effect along the entire California coast as waves are expected to break up to 40 feet high. As of Thursday afternoon, reports from the Bay Area&apos;s coastal buoys were showing waves just under 30 feet off both the Sonoma County coast and Monterey Bay.\nHuge low-pressure systems in the Pacific Ocean are pushing large groups of waves toward the California coast.\nThe National Weather Service reported that its buoy off Bodega Bay recorded waves up to 28 feet on Thursday morning, closing in on the previous record of 31 feet seen during January storms at the beginning of the year.\nEvacuation warnings lifted after high surf and flooding shut down Santa Cruz, coastal areas Around Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar Beach, the waves crashed over walls, flooding streets, and depositing massive trees and driftwood ashore.\n\"The trees act like battering rams against the houses and the garage doors that are along the street here,\" says resident, Steve Benedetti.\nResidents in Santa Cruz County know the danger all too well. So do the authorities. But they worried about the tourists.\n\"We do have visitors from out of town that may not have been expecting this kind of tidal surge during their visit. So we did have deputies out here very early going door to door explaining to people hey this is coming,\" says Ashley Keehn, public information officer with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&apos;s Office.\nEarly in the morning, the Stinson Beach Fire Department issued an evacuation order for several neighborhoods because of high surf as the winds and waves were enormous, telling people they could find a temporary safe harbor at the Stinson Beach Community Center.\nThe order was issued just before 10 a.m., and people were sent to the Stinson Beach Community Center for refuge. Residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera, Embarcadero, and sections of Calle Del Arroyo weren’t told to return to their homes until early in the afternoon.\nDrone pilot David Golubev shot video of the swell hitting the beach around 11 a.m. and getting dangerously close to houses and buildings along the shoreline.\n\"Definitely the highest tide I’ve seen so far. You could see it on the beach. It came up all the way to the top,\" Golubev said. \"I saw it was high tide, and I heard the water so I came out to see how far the water came up.\"\nOfficials said the waves reached 10 feet, more than the National Weather Service predicted.\nThe evacuation order was lifted in the early afternoon when the tide receded.\nStinson Beach Fire Chief Jesse Peri said crews are still assessing the damage in the area and at last count Thursday afternoon one person has minor injuries and a handful of homes suffered minor structural damage.\n\"The community is really resilient, so they came together to help sandbag and help each other out,\" said Peri, who reiterated that people should continue to stay away from the water.\nFurther south in San Francisco, strong swells crashed against San Francisco&apos;s Fort Point.\nImage 1 of 10 ▼ Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded in Santa Cruz on Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "HONG KONG: Hong Kong announced plans on Thursday for a blanket ban on e-cigarettes, citing a “consensus” on the need for action and their impact on the health of young people. The move came about two years after the Chinese city banned the import, manufacture and sale of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. “We will fully ban all alternative smoking products,” Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said at a news conference, using the government term for products such as e-cigarettes. Hong Kong already bans possession of e-cigarettes “for commercial purposes” and Thursday´s proposal would extend the ban to retail buyers, even if they intended to smoke in private. Under existing laws, anyone in Hong Kong who imports e-cigarettes can be punished by up to seven years in jail and a fine of HK$2 million ($256,000), while sellers and manufacturers can be jailed for up to six months. “A blanket ban on alternative smoking products has become a consensus in society... It is time to ban all forms of possession of alternative smoking products, including for personal use,” said Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee. City officials also announced other smoking curbs on Thursday, including a ban on smoking while queueing in outdoor public areas and sharing cigarettes with minors. The government also proposed banning flavoured tobacco, which officials said survey results showed particularly appealed to women and young people. Lo said he hoped the e-cigarette ban and other proposals would be introduced to the legislature this year.

    "text": "Alaqua Cox Talks Echo's Comparisons to Her Personal Life The MCU star reveals how she relates to her onscreen hero. The premiere of Marvel's [Echo](/category/echo-tv-show/) is on the horizon, introducing [a whole new story](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/marvel-studios-echo-tv-ma-rating-explained-exclusive/) to the fold of the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](/category/marvel-cinematic-universe/). Echo, which will air on both [Disney+](/category/disney-streaming-service/) and [Hulu](/category/hulu/), will [flesh out the journey of](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/marvel-echo-unique-history-mcu-maya-lopez/) Maya Lopez / Echo (Alaqua Cox), who quickly became a breakout character after her appearance on the Hawkeye Disney+ series. In a recent interview with ComicBook.com, Cox revealed how she feels connected to the character of Echo, even if their personal experiences [weren't exactly the same](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvels-echo-star-alaqua-cox-explains-mayas-new-powers/). \"Not in a bad way,\" Cox explained in our interview, which you can check out above. \"She has a lot of traumatic things that happened to her. Growing up, I had surgeries all of my childhood. So she has her own trauma and I have my own trauma, as well, from childhood. So we've gone through a lot of stuff. Because I do have a prosthetic leg. I've had those surgeries as I was growing up. That makes me feel resilient and a warrior, and I feel very similar, that we have those traits together, the trauma has made us have the similar traits.\" Is Echo Connected to the MCU? Echo is confirmed to be a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the inaugural title under [Marvel Studios](/category/marvel-studios/)' Marvel Spotlight banner. [Announced last year](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/echo-tv-series-released-marvel-spotlight-banner-trailer-new-mcu/), the Marvel Spotlight label will be used on titles that present a wider variety of stories, [which don't require as much prior knowledge of the MCU.](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/echo-director-confirms-dont-need-to-watch-other-marvel-shows-daredevil-hawkeye-to-understand-series/) The name Marvel Spotlight originates from a Marvel Comics anthology series of the same name, which ran across the 1970s and 1980s and led to many characters' debuts. It has also been reported that Marvel's forthcoming Wonder Man series [will also fall under](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/wonder-man-disney-plus-marvel-spotlight-banner-mcu/) the Marvel Spotlight banner. \"It's kind of like the comics, in that there are certain stories that tie into the continuity and really play into the overall narrative, and there's other ones that are more standalone and are character-driven like Echo is,\" Marvel producer Brad Winderbaum [explained to ComicBook.com](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/marvel-echo-mcu-producer-explain-marvel-spotlight-banner-mcu/). \"Really, what the Spotlight branding represents is an opportunity for people who are more casual fans who might not know what happened in the last Avengers movie to show up and kind of enjoy it on its own terms.\" What Is Marvel's Echo About? Starring [Alaqua Cox](https://comicbook.com/category/alaqua-cox/), all five episodes of [Echo](https://comicbook.com/category/echo-tv-show/) will debut exclusively on both Disney+ and Hulu on Tuesday, January 9th. The origin story of [Echo](https://comicbook.com/category/echo-tv-show/) revisits Maya Lopez, whose ruthless behavior in New York City catches up with her in her hometown. She must face her past, reconnect with her Native American roots and embrace the meaning of family and community if she ever hopes to move forward. [Vincent D'Onofrio](https://comicbook.com/category/vincent-donofrio/) will reprise his role as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin, and [Charlie Cox](https://comicbook.com/category/charlie-cox/) will reprise his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil. [Echo](https://comicbook.com/category/echo-tv-show/) will also star Chaske Spencer, Tantoo Cardinal, Devery Jacobs, Cody Lightning, Graham Greene and Zahn McClarnon. Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Brad Winderbaum, Stephen Broussard, Richie Palmer, Marion Dayre, and Jason Gavin (Blackfeet) are executive producers of [Echo](https://comicbook.com/category/echo-tv-show/).

Embracing the daunting task of revitalizing Sri Lanka’s faltering economy, which many deemed challenging, the President underscored his success in stabilizing the nation’s economic trajectory within a mere two years. He emphasized that unity was the sole requisite for propelling the country towards progress.\nAddressing a gathering of young Members of Parliament and emerging political figures from the Nuwara Eliya District at the Nuwara Eliya President’s House yesterday (18),\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe reiterated his commitment to fostering the region’s development into a premier tourist destination. Despite criticisms levelled against the government’s initiatives for Nuwara Eliya’s advancement, the President asserted that with widespread support, such efforts could catalyse a transformative shift in the nation’s economic landscape.\nPresident Wickremesinghe cautioned against the pitfalls of antiquated political strategies, emphasizing the imperative of concerted efforts to attract essential investments for national development. He highlighted the people’s jubilant celebration of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year under the government’s sound economic policies, noting a marked increase in people’s livelihoods across various sectors. His overarching goal, he stated, was to ensure that these benefits reached every segment of society.\nThe young parliamentarians apprised the President of the challenges they encounter and presented their proposals pertaining to the nation’s development agenda.\nIn a bid to empower the youth demographic, the President outlined plans to establish regional youth centres in each divisional secretariat division. He pledged to nurture budding entrepreneurs through these centres, with intentions to engage bank executives and trade board members in the process.\nAshoka Herath, representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, expressed his endorsement of the President’s programme despite his affiliation with another party during the event. He emphasized his backing for the program, highlighting its importance.\nHe noted that had everyone supported the “Yali Pubudamu Sri Lanka” programme initiated in 2001 while the President was the Prime Minister and was scheduled to conclude in 2025, Sri Lanka would have already achieved developed status. He also lamented the undermining of the ongoing program aimed at transforming the country into a developed nation by 2048.\nHerath stated his commitment to providing necessary support over the next two years to extend President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s leadership for another decade, facilitating a revolutionary transformation of the nation.\nFormer MP K.K.Piyadasa, former Nuwara Eliya Mayor Chandana Lal Karunaratne and a group of former municipal councillors and regional youth politicians from the Nuwara Eliya district.\nShare previous post IMF ready to support Sri Lanka’s discussions with bondholders next post Popular tele actresses found recruiting mercenaries You may also like Environmental assessment report approved to start cultivation activities at Polonnaruwa Kandakadu farm April 19, 2024 India heads to the polls in world’s biggest election April 19, 2024 Israel attacks Iran, sources say, drones reported over Isfahan April 19, 2024 Today’s weather forecast April 19, 2024 Popular tele actresses found recruiting mercenaries April 19, 2024 IMF ready to support Sri Lanka’s discussions with bondholders April 19, 2024 Leave a Comment Cancel Reply\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.",
