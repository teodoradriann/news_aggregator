    "title": "UPDATE: Remains found in convicted killer's old basement ID'd as missing city woman; DA says charges coming soon, 'one' suspect in case",
    "text": "JOHNSTOWN, Pa. – Skeletal remains found Friday in the basement of convicted murderer Brian Bradley Giles' former home were positively identified as the body of Giles' former girlfriend, Jilly Todaro, officials said Thursday. Todaro had been missing since December 2020. Cambria County Coroner Jeff Lees said the identification of the remains was completed through body imaging Wednesday by a forensic odontologist and anthropologist. With an autopsy and a forensic examination complete, Lees ruled the manner of death homicide. Nobody had been charged in Todaro's death as of Thursday morning – but Cambria County District Attorney Greg Neugebauer said he expects charges to be filed in the near future, and he answered plainly when asked how many suspects there are. \"One,\" he said. \"That should tell you something.\" Giles, 48, was convicted last Thursday in Cambria County court of first-degree murder and aggravated assault in the slaying of his wife, Nancy Giles, who had been reported missing in 2018. Her remains were found in May 2019 along a trail on the Inclined Plane hillside in downtown Johnstown. Brian Giles and Todaro had been involved in a relationship as the investigation of Nancy Giles' disappearance and death was developing. An earlier search of the Johnstown home that Todaro shared with Brian Giles was conducted in 2020, after Todaro was reported missing. Her remains were unearthed Friday in the basement of that home, located on the 500 block of Franklin Street in the city's Kernville section. \"The details of what led us there again last week are in a sealed search warrant,\" Neugebauer said. \"I can't go into detail about that, but we had for the first time very specific information relative to where a body would be located. Obviously, when we went there, we expected it to be Jilly.\" Neugebauer said the information received last Friday bolsters the case. \"As a result of the information we got on Friday, our case is going to be stronger,\" he said. \"Like lots of things in life, sometimes patience pays off.\" Todaro, who was 43 when she disappeared, would have been 46 at the time her remains were found. \"I am not going to elaborate on the cause of death at this time, other than to say it was homicidal violence,\" Lees said. \"I've been in contact with Jilly's family, who is very grateful that she has been found and they can start the healing and grieving process.\" 'I wish she knew how many people cared' Lees and Neugebauer spoke during a press conference Thursday at Lees' office in Johnstown, alongside Johnstown Police Department Detective Brad Christ and Cambria County Assistant District Attorney Jessica Aurandt. \"There wasn't a day that went by that we didn't spend time working this case,\" Christ said. \"Between the whole detective bureau at JPD, I can't even calculate the number of hours we spent on this. And again, we couldn't do this without the prosecution team with Assistant District Attorney Jess Aurandt.\" Christ and Neugebauer urged the public to report domestic abuse when they see it. \"If you know somebody who is in a bad situation, a spouse – male or female – please contact us. There is help out there,\" Christ said. \"We will do everything in our power to help.\" Law enforcement officials offered help to Todaro, who was allegedly the victim of multiple assaults by Giles before her disappearance, The Tribune-Democrat archives show. She had personal cellphone numbers for police officers and sat at the conference table in the district attorney's office, Neugebauer said. \"Jilly was really a nice person. She really was,\" Neugebauer said. \"I don't think she always liked things I had to say to her, or Jess (Aurandt) had to say to her, but we were coming from a good place, trying to help her. She was a good person.\" \"This one hits me a little differently,\" Neugebauer said. \"Every homicide is a tragedy. This one is just a little different.\" Aurandt said she experienced many emotions when Todaro's remains were identified. \"It was like a weight that had been sitting there for three and a half years had been lifted,\" she said, \"but then to see the remains of a person who struggled in her life to be treated with dignity, and who I know did not feel the worth that she truly had during her lifetime – to see those remains, I don't know I can articulate how that feels. \"I just wish that Jilly could have seen, in her lifetime, the amount of people who rallied together, who made a lot of sacrifices to ensure that she was found and treated with the dignity she deserved. I wish she could have seen how many people care. I see a lot of public response to this case. I wish she knew how many people cared, and how many people care now.\"",

    "title": "Cher Files for Conservatorship of son Elijah Blue Allman",
    "text": "The very famous singer Cher has filed for the conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman after his issue with substance abuse. She has claimed that her child is suffering from severe mental health issues and substance abuse issues, and therefore he will be unable to manage his finances. In the documents filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, the mother of 47-year old Elijah is seeking to be the sole conservator of his son’s wealth. The document also seems to state that Elijah is currently unable to manage his assets due to the severe mental and substance abuse issues that haunt the young man. Cher also claims that Elijah is due to receive assets from a trust, and a conservator is required to protect his property from loss. The documents also state that Elijah’s wife is not fit to be his conservator because their relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises. His wife, Marieangela King, once accused Cher of kidnapping her husband from a hotel. This shows that the duo was not on good terms for a long time. Cher fears that the funds that are to be received by Elijah by the end of the year will be immediately spent on drugs, which will eventually leave Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and will put his life at risk. The filing also says that Cher deeply cares for her son and has always acted with his best interests in mind. A hearing for a temporary order is currently set for January 25, 2024, with the hearing on a permanent order scheduled for March 6, 2024. Everyone might be wondering how conservatorships work. It is usually filed when a person is considered to have a severely diminished mental capacity and is unable to take decisions that are best for them. The court grants someone the power to make financial decisions and major life choices for them. Cher on the abduction of her son Earlier in October this year, Cher broke the silence on the allegations by her daughter-in-law. King claimed that Cher has kidnapped her husband, who is also Cher’s son, from a hotel room. In an interaction, the singer said that the rumor was not true and also declined to comment further on it. A report surfaced that Cher allegedly hired four men to forcibly remove her son from a hotel room in New York City. King made these claims in her divorce paper that she filed against Elijah in December. She has also openly spoken about her son’s drug addictions and said that she is not the only mother who is suffering from such problems. She has been watching her son’s years-long struggles with substance abuse. She said in an interview that I’m a mother. This is my job, one way or another, to try to help my children. You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache—mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile, you love them, and you try to be there for them. Elijah Blue Allman was born on July 10, 1976, a year after Gregg Allman and Cher married. They got separated three years after their son was born. Cher and Elijah have not had a normal relationship. She said in an interview with Robin McGraw on Dr. Phil that she and her son do not have a very stable relationship. King has also claimed that they were working on their marriage by spending some days alone to try and save it up. But Elijah was removed by four men, and she said that one of them revealed that they were hired by Cher herself. Cher, nevertheless, has consistently stated that she will be there for her kids anytime they need her.",

    "text": "Esta Navidad Jesús nació entre la masacre y el asombro por la incapacidad de la comunidad internacional para detenerla. Tierra Santa se tiñe de sangre con escenas de pavor y vergüenza. Desde la escalada violenta de octubre pasado, con el reprochable ataque a territorio israelí por parte del grupo islamista Hamás (quienes gobiernan la Franja de Gaza desde el 2007) causando 1.200 muertos y 240 rehenes, la respuesta de Israel mediante la declaración de “guerra” ha sido aterradora. El saldo: alrededor de 21.100 palestinos muertos y más de 55.000 heridos; con mayor baja de población inocente que de extremistas. De las víctimas mortales, casi 10.000 son niños.\nLos fundamentalistas exigen reivindicación territorial y libertad usando medios violentos; Israel defiende la “tierra prometida” con acciones indiscriminadas, genocidas; como si aplicara una limpieza étnica contra los palestinos con fuerza despiadada. “Serás fuerte cuando aprendas a no dañar”, dice Alejandro Jodorowsky. En su lucha contra Hamás, Israel arrasa todo. Esto genera repudio, como el de Craig Mokhiber, funcionario de la Oficina de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas, quien renunció a su cargo al afirmar: “Una vez más asistimos al desarrollo de un genocidio ante nuestros ojos, y la organización a la que servimos parece no poder detenerlo… en Gaza, se ataca gratuitamente a viviendas civiles, escuelas, iglesias, mezquitas e instituciones médicas, y se masacra a miles de personas civiles”.\nEl papa Francisco denunció: “Civiles indefensos están siendo bombardeados y tiroteados. Y esto ha ocurrido incluso dentro del recinto parroquial de la Sagrada Familia, donde no hay terroristas, sino familias, niños, enfermos, discapacitados, monjas...”. El primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, culpa a Hamás de usar civiles como escudos humanos. Para un alto al fuego exige la entrega de rehenes, que desmantelen su aforo bélico y terminen su dominio político en Gaza. Defiende su guerra “civilizada” contra la “barbarie” rival. La visión de Netanyahu y el radicalismo de Hamás auguran un desenlace peligroso; más cuando los combates alcanzan Cisjordania, el Líbano, e Irán amenaza atizar el fuego. Palestina exige libertad y autonomía. Israel no lo desea política y militarmente fortalecido. Compleja situación, cuya solución racional daría tranquilidad a ambos pueblos, la región, y evitaría derramar más sangre; pero falta la voluntad de ellos y sus aliados.\nDuelen los niños palestinos fulminados por la sinrazón; así como los del conflicto Rusia-Ucrania, de las migraciones forzadas, de zonas africanas sin agua ni alimento, los de la región víctimas de la inseguridad. Hace poco se deseó ‘Feliz Navidad’, hoy se preparan las fiestas de fin de año, mientras angustiados padres palestinos aún buscan a sus hijos entre escombros y hospitales. Esperamos que la vicepresidenta ecuatoriana, Verónica Abad, designada embajadora de la paz entre Israel y Palestina, gestione ayuda humanitaria para los niños, mujeres, ancianos, enfermos, desplazados que imploran comida, abrigo y ruegan no ser alcanzados por una bomba.
