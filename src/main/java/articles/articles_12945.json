    "title": "Apple launches a gold strap for your Apple Watch: the price? Better not to know",
    "text": "One of the straps that we had seen at the presentation of the Apple Watch Series 10 has been officially launched yesterday. It is a gold strap in the two available sizes, 42 and 46 mm, which we can purchase starting today.\nIt works, like the rest, for other watch models, not only with the latest one, however, what you may not like so much is the price, since it will cost as much or more than some Apple Watch models so it is not intended for all audiences.\nGold strap for Apple Watch The design would be made up of links, made of 316L stainless steel, so let’s not think that it is solid gold, something impossible in a strap of that weight, since it would be much more expensive, and even more so now, at the price of gold.\nCurrently, we can find it for 349 euros in Spain, the cost in the United States being $349, so at least, in exchange, it is not worth more, as usually happens. However, even though we pay for it today, we will not receive it until the first week of December, so we would have to wait a little, and this type of accessories, so expensive and exclusive, are not in very high demand, and Therefore, not a manufacturing one either, so if you want one, at least before Christmas, you should order it, as the delivery date could go up.\nIt has a 3-year warranty, although if it receives a blow or breaks, you will not be eligible for this, so you will have to be careful, since we are not talking about a normal strap.\nThere are quite similar imitations on Amazon. I, personally, have a similar one, and we can get it for just over 20 euros, so if you simply like the design, but don’t want to pay that much for it, it is an option to consider.\nIn the same launch, we have two other models, or rather, colors, since the material, as we said, is simulation. We would talk about “Slate” and “Natural”. Of course, at the same price as Gold.\nThe link bracelet is made of 316L stainless steel alloy and has more than 100 pieces. Its manufacturing process is so meticulous that it takes almost nine hours to cut the links for a single bracelet. The folding clasp blends with the curves of the design. And if you want to add or remove links, no problem: many have a button to release them without the need for special tools.\nAs we can see, the price is not given by its material itself, but by the process and labor behind each one of them, so now it is your decision if you really want to pay that much for one, or prefer Go for the imitations from Amazon, which, honestly, are very good.\nLeave us a comment with your opinion about this product, and if you have considered purchasing it, or think it is crazy to pay so much for a simple strap.\nThe entry Apple launches a gold strap for your Apple Watch: the price? Better not to know was published first in La Manzana Mordida.",

    "text": "The evidence against the pro-abort, anti-gun, and anti-courage Democrat nominee for vice president, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, is overwhelming. When faced with the possibility of deploying to Iraq as the senior noncommissioned officer in his artillery battalion, Walz hastily retired and took a one-rank demotion rather than go. He did this despite his campaign announcing that he would deploy to Iraq when the mobilization of his battalion was made public. This announcement was made even though Walz had already submitted his request to retire before his enlistment had expired; he was two years short of meeting that obligation. Since that time, he has given at least one interview that indicates he told a journalist that he had served in Iraq and is on video claiming to have been in combat.

That interference has gone from trying to defend the indefensible to claiming that JD Vance serving as a Marine Corps public affairs specialist in Anbar Province, Iraq, doesn't really count as combat. Here is CNN's noxious Brianna Kielar floating that trial balloon. I also think that JD Vance, as a messenger on this, may be an imperfect messenger. Because we have, as you introduced him as a combat correspondent which is what his title was. But when you dig a little deeper into that, he was a public affairs specialist. Someone who did not see combat, but certainly the title combat correspondent tends to give you a different impression. So he may be the imperfect messenger on this. Vance [responded](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1821605143689019589). Brianna this is disgusting, and you and your entire network should be ashamed of yourselves. When I got the call to go to Iraq, I went. Tim Walz said he carried a gun in a war. Did he? No. It was a lie. Kielar's statement is the worst sort of dishonesty. Vance served in Anbar Province for six months in \" [late 2005.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance#Early_life_and_education)\" During [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anbar_campaign_(2003%E2%80%932011)#2005), Anbar was ground zero for Iraqi insurgent activity. Kielar says that being a combat correspondent makes you an \"imperfect messenger\" for criticizing someone who abandoned their soldiers as they were preparing to deploy. If you served in Iraq or Afghanistan, you were in combat. Suicide bombers, insider attacks, and rockets and mortar rounds hit Forward Operating Bases. The largest one-day loss in CIA history took place at the [Camp Chapman attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Chapman_attack) in Afghanistan when a suicide bomber killed ten people and seriously wounded six. By Kielar's metric, none of those people were actually in combat because they were safe and sound on a defended base. Just because you were a public affairs specialist doesn't mean you weren't in [danger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance#Early_life_and_education). McClung, who was 34 at the time of her death, was serving as a media relations officer when a roadside bomb killed her instantly in Ramadi, Iraq, Dec. 6, 2006. She and two other service members assigned the Army’s Brigade Combat Team, Capt. Travis Patriquin and Spec. Vincent Pomante, III, were also killed. The convoy McClung had been riding in was escorting Newsweek journalists when an improvised explosive device struck their vehicle. The Newsweek journalists were in another vehicle and escaped without injury. McClung had been escorting retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North and a Fox News Channel camera crew earlier in the day and were devastated when they learned the news of the attack. More to the point, whether Vance served in combat or even served at all is immaterial. Walz connived to retire two years before he should have. He started the retirement process after discovering his unit was going to Iraq. His campaign announced less than two months before Walz took a demotion and retired that he was deploying with his battalion. Anyone who did not abandon their troops as they were heading into combat is a perfect messenger for the story on Walz.",

    "text": "Sección patrocinada por\nNoticias destacadas\nEl tiempo\nLa AEMET actualiza su previsión para Semana Santa: bajón brusco de temperaturas y lluvias a partir de este día\nEl tiempo inestable podría afectar a las vacaciones. ¿Dónde hará más calor y dónde lloverá más en Semana Santa?\nEl\ntiempo de esta Semana Santa será variable y con tendencia a la inestabilidad. Comenzará con sol y temperaturas suaves en amplias zonas; continuará con frío, lluvias casi generalizadas y nieve en las montañas, y podría acabar lluviosa en la mayor parte de la península y Canarias, según la predicción especial de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) para el periodo vacacional. Como explica el organismo, la previsión se irá actualizando diariamente hasta el próximo Sábado Santo, 30 de marzo.\nEste viernes, día de inicio de las vacaciones para muchos ciudadanos, el tiempo será estable en la mayor parte de España y los termómetros volverán a marcar más de 30 grados en zonas del sur peninsular. Las temperaturas descenderán en el Cantábrico, el norte de Galicia y Canarias; se mantendrán en los Pirineos y subirán en el resto del país. Los termómetros marcarán al menos 25 grados en 29 capitales de provincia, con los valores más altos en Córdoba, Huelva y Sevilla (30); Badajoz y Jaén (29), y Almería y Ciudad Real (28). En cambio, suavizará en Santander (15), Oviedo (16) y San Sebastián (17). .\nEl cielo soleado se impondrá en muchas zonas de España, con algunas excepciones. La DANA que afectó el miércoles y el jueves a la península tenderá a acercarse a las Islas Canarias, donde dejará precipitaciones intensas desde este viernes y durante todo el fin de semana. Los chubascos podrían afectar a todo el archipiélago, serán más intensos en el norte de las islas, con alguna tormenta ocasional, y podrán ser localmente fuertes en las de mayor relieve. Además, la cota de nieve estará en 1800/2200 metros en las islas occidentales.\nEn cuanto al resto del país, se esperan nubes en el norte de Galicia y el área cantábrica, que también se esperan por la mañana en zonas próximas al sur por la mañana y también al final del día por el acercamiento de un frente frío, que dejará lluvias desplazándose de oeste a este. Asimismo, es probable que en los principales sistemas montañosos se desarrolle nubosidad de evolución, con chubascos aislados o tormentas ocasionales. Continuará la calima en la península y Baleares, con lo que lloverá barro allá donde aparezcan precipitaciones, y surgirán brumas y nieblas matinales en el extremo norte peninsular, el sur de la Comunidad Valenciana y Baleares.\nDurante el fin de semana se impondrá el tiempo estable. Se esperan cielos con intervalos de nubes medias y altas, excepto en el Cantábrico, donde los cielos permanecerán cubiertos de nubes bajas, con probables precipitaciones débiles el sábado. Habrá nubosidad de evolución diurna en los sistemas montañosos, que podría dar lugar a chubascos o tormentas aisladas. Las temperaturas descenderán al resto de la mitad norte y el domingo a la vertiente mediterránea.\nLa DANA dejará precipitaciones intensas en Canarias. El sábado será el día más adverso, con chubascos generalizados, acompañados de tormenta, que serán más probables, intensos y persistentes en el norte de las islas montañosas. Se espera que vayan extendiéndose de oeste a este durante ese día, sin descartar granizo de forma ocasional y con cotas de nieve en torno a 2.000-2.200 metros. El domingo todavía continuará la inestabilidad, aunque es probable que la DANA comience a alejarse de las islas, por lo que se espera que los chubascos sean menos intensos que el día anterior.\nEntre el lunes y el Miércoles Santo se abre un escenario más incierto. No obstante, el comunicado de la AEMET recoge que \"el escenario más probable contempla la penetración de sucesivos frentes, lo que dejaría cielos nubosos y precipitaciones abundantes y generalizadas en la Península y Baleares\". La cota de nieve descendería bruscamente a partir de la tarde del lunes hasta entre 800 y 1.000 metros, con lo que nevará en los principales sistemas montañosos, sin descartarse en zonas aledañas.\nEs probable que las temperaturas desciendan de forma acusada el lunes y el martes, cuando se esperan heladas nocturnas en los sistemas montañosos y páramos de la mitad norte. Canarias continuaría con inestabilidad, pues seguirían los cielos nubosos y las precipitaciones, más probables en el norte de las islas, sin descartar que se extiendan el martes a puntos del sur, cuando bajarían las temperaturas.\nCon un cierto grado de incertidumbre, es probable que entre el Jueves Santo y el Sábado Santo continúe el tiempo inestable en la península, con el paso de sucesivos frentes que dejarían cielos nubosos y precipitaciones generalizadas, menos probables en la vertiente mediterránea y más abundantes en la vertiente atlántica. Las nevadas quedarían restringidas a zonas de montaña y las temperaturas tenderían a recuperarse. En Canarias es probable que esos días continúen los cielos nubosos y las precipitaciones, más probables en la mitad occidental y en el norte de las islas, con temperaturas con pocos cambios.",

    "text": "It Takes Two was one of my favourite games back in 2021, and probably one of the best co-op games of all time. Turns out a lot of folks agreed, as it won Game of the Year at the Keighly’s – I mean, The Game Awards.\nhttps://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1846588233573937193 Now, years later, the game has broken a new milestone, with over 20 Million copies sold, which is pretty incredible. Writing on X (Formely Twitter) Hazelight Studios shared the following message :\n“ It Takes Two HAS SOLD OVER 20 MILLION!!! You’re the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds! We’re so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May. “\nIf you haven’t played it, you can check out our review here :\nHazelight Teases New IP The game was released in partnership with Electronic Arts and their EA Originals label, and it seems that partnership is about to bear new fruit, because now Hazelight are teasing a new IP .\nhttps://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1846929745016987890 There are plenty of clues in the image above, and it seems we’re definitely in for another co-operatively focused titles from Hazelight. Those hoping for a sequel, perhaps ‘It Takes Three’ look like they’re going to be left wanting.\nEither way, we can’t wait to see what Hazelight and EA Originals have in store for us.",
