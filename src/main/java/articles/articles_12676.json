    "title": "Insurers Report Rising Hail Damage Claims",
    "text": "Golf balls, tennis balls, softballs. All sound like the stuff of fun games — except when they are used to describe the size of the\nhailstones that often accompany severe thunderstorms.\nThose hailstones can cause significant damage to homes and cars, a growing worry as\nwarming temperatures fuel more destructive storms. This month, baseball-size hail, sometimes called “gorilla hail” because of its heft, was reported in Kansas and Missouri.\nThe insurance industry reported $60 billion in losses from “severe\nconvective storms” — a catchall name for thunderstorms that may spawn hail, heavy rain, lightning, high winds and tornadoes — last year, said Mark Friedlander, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. In 2022, the industry reported $31 billion in losses.\nData from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s\nStorm Prediction Center show 5,879 reports of hailstones of one inch or larger in 2022, up 17 percent from 5,020 in 2021. Preliminary data for 2023 show 6,962 reports, including a significant increase in reports of very large hailstones of two inches or more.\nA weather expert countered that it was unclear whether severe hail had significantly increased in the United States over the long term. Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at the\nNational Severe Storms Laboratory, which is also part of NOAA, said the storm prediction center’s hail data should be viewed with caution.\nReports, for instance, can be submitted by volunteer spotters whose training may vary. (Typically, people reporting hail are asked to compare it to the size of a ball or coin, which is then translated into a measurement in inches.) Also, the criteria for severe hail was changed in 2010, making historical comparisons challenging.\nStill, insurers are reporting bigger hail losses. In 2023, State Farm paid 27,300 claims for hail damage to homes and businesses, up from 23,200 in 2022, said Heather Paul, a company spokeswoman. Payouts totaled $6.1 billion last year, more than the previous two years combined.\n“We’re seeing severe weather increase,” Ms. Paul said.\nIn addition, inflation is driving up the cost of materials and labor to repair the damage, increasing insurers’ liability. More\ndevelopment in areas affected by severe storms is also a factor. State Farm’s average homeowner hail claim last year was about $17,000, up from $16,000 in 2022, Ms. Paul said.\nThat’s a worrying trend for homeowners because losses mean insurers may get “bold with nipping and tucking of coverage,” said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group. Property owners and insurance adjusters have suggested that insurers are “getting aggressive” in denying hail claims, she said.\nInsurers may deem roof damage to be\nmerely cosmetic and cover less of the cost to fix it, or determine that it was mostly caused by wear and tear over time, Ms. Bach said. “I’m hearing that a lot,” she said. Check your policy for any limits or exclusions on coverage.\nMr. Friedlander of the Insurance Information Institute said property insurers were “financial first responders” in helping customers recover from severe weather. “They are paying hail claims based on the coverage as defined in the policy,” he said. “Each insurer has its own criteria for determining when a roof needs full replacement versus if it can be repaired from storm damage.”\nLittle can be done to protect your house if hail is imminent, but there are ways to fortify your property ahead of time to reduce damage. “If you’re in the market for a new roof, it’s a great time to upgrade your system as a whole,” said Ian Giammanco, lead meteorologist at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, which researches ways to strengthen homes against storms.\nHail accounts for much of the damage from severe thunderstorms, he said, and roofs bear the brunt of it. So it helps to use strong, impact-resistant roof shingles.\nAsphalt shingles, used on three-fourths of homes in North America, are considered impact resistant if they are rated a three or four by independent laboratory tests (on a scale of one to four), Mr. Giammanco said. The home safety institute conducts further testing and publishes\nrankings (from “poor” to “excellent”) of commonly available products. Metal or tile roofs can also offer hail protection.\nImpact-resistant shingles may cost more than conventional shingles — as much as twice the price, depending on location, Mr. Giammanco said. For people in areas with frequent hailstorms — like Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Midwest — the extra cost may be worth it. (Some data suggest that the traditional “hail alley” in the country’s midsection is shifting east. State Farm’s list of top states for hail claims paid included Illinois, at No. 2.)\nOn the plus side, insurance companies may offer premium discounts for properties with impact-rated roofing; check with your agent.\nIf you can’t swing the higher cost, take steps to make sure your roof is in good shape to avoid problems if you ever need to file a hail claim, Ms. Bach said. If your roof is at least 10 years old, consider having a reputable roofer inspect it to see if it needs repairs, she said.\nHere are some questions and answers about hail:\nHow can I protect my car from hail damage?\nIf you don’t have a garage to shield your car, you may need to get creative if hail is in the forecast. Special\ninflatable covers that resemble puffer coats for cars may be a good option, Ms. Bach said. They cost several hundred dollars, though, so if that’s not in your budget, you may need to consider cheaper options.\n“Raid your linen closet,” Ms. Paul of State Farm suggested. Heavy blankets, layered on your windshield, may help avoid or reduce damage. One car dealer advises\nanchoring the blankets by tucking edges inside the car doors or trunk and closing them.\nDoes my auto insurance policy cover hail damage to my car?\nProtection for your car is covered by your auto policy’s “comprehensive” coverage, which is optional unless required under the terms of your car loan or lease. Check your policy or contact your insurance agent to confirm coverage. The deductible — the amount you pay out of pocket — is commonly $500. After a hailstorm, it’s smart to take pictures and videos to document damage to your car as soon as it’s safe to go outside.\nDo insurance policies have special hail deductibles?\nPolicies in hail-prone states may have separate deductibles for hail and wind damage, Mr. Friedlander said. They are usually based on a percentage of the home’s estimated replacement cost. For a home with a replacement cost of $300,000 and a 2 percent deductible, you would be responsible for $6,000. To see if you have this deductible, check your policy’s “declarations” page.\nThe post\n Insurers Report Rising Hail Damage Claims appeared first on New York Times.",

    "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Motorcyclists from across the Southeast gathered on Saturday, Sept. 21, for the 31st annual [Trail of Tears Commemorative Motorcycle Ride](https://www.facebook.com/Trailoftearsmotorcycle), a scenic journey across northern Alabama to honor Native Americans. The ride began in Bridgeport and traveled through North Alabama to Waterloo. Festivities included a kick-off rally in Bridgeport on Friday, featuring live music, street dances, and fireworks. Event organizers expected up to 10,000 riders to participate. The town of Waterloo is hosting an Indian Festival through Sunday, presented by the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission. Highlights of the festival include a \"living history\" exhibit of a soldier encampment, as well as demonstrations from Native American artisans and vendors. \"When I see all these bikers and these people, I hope that we're bringing awareness to that bad and dark chapter of history. and, you know, our history, good or bad, needs to be remembered,\" Ike Moore, President of Trail of Tears shares. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 called for the removal of all Indians from the eastern United States to the state of Oklahoma, whether voluntary or by force. In May 1838, the deadline for voluntary native removal, prompted the Cherokee \"Trail of Tears,\" known as one of the darkest episodes in relations between the United States and Native Americans. \"I don't remember much of what most of my teachers said, but I remember her saying, boys and girls, this is just like you and your family we're sitting at home and having dinner and soldiers showed up at the door and took you out of the house,\" Moore explains. \"You didn't finish your dinner; you didn't put on your shoes. you just got snatched up out of your house and moved away at home. I thought man, that's awful\" It was during that year that the U.S. government hired wagon master J.C.S. Hood to transport Native Americans by foot and wagon from Ross's Landing in Chattanooga, Tennessee to what is now Waterloo. Much of the journey followed what is now Highway 72, at the cost of as many as 4,000 Native American lives.

And since her recovery, she's been wanting to find a way to pay it forward through her Bat Mitzvah project. \"When I was in the hospital, everyone donated gifts to me,\" Gabbi Roosth told WPBF 25 News. And since her recovery, she's been wanting to find a way to pay it forward through her Bat Mitzvah project. \"When I was in the hospital, everyone donated gifts to me,\" Gabbi Roosth told WPBF 25 News. And since her recovery, she's been wanting to find a way to pay it forward through her Bat Mitzvah project. It's the one thing that stuck with 13-year-old Gabbi Roosth when she was recovering from spinal surgery at the Palm Beach Children's Hospital: receiving a toy every single day. \"When I was in the hospital, everyone donated gifts to me,\" the teenager told WPBF 25 News. And since her recovery, she has been looking for ways to give back to the community members who provided her with the care and comfort while she was a patient. The perfect opportunity came about when the seventh-grader was assigned her school's Mitzvah project this year. \"I made an Amazon wish list for all my friends and family to choose gifts for the kids in the hospital,\" she said. With the help of her parents, Roosth collected more than 2o0 toys at her Bat Mitzvah in February. \"After her surgery, she’d met with the life specialist, and they would bring her gifts on a daily basis,\" Kenneth Roosth, Gabbi's father, told WPBF 25 News. \"She’s a great kid, and I think it’s wonderful, like there’s so many teens they make it all about themselves. And I was just really proud that she wanted to think of others,\" Debbie Roosth, Gabbi's mother, said. The children's hospital gifts toys to all of its patients every day, and it's become something that families look forward to daily. \"It’s hard. And so, every day when the child life specialist would come in, it was very uplifting,\" the teen's mother said. \"They’re really short on toys for babies and teens. So, we kind of concentrated on those areas.\" While it may be just a toy to some, for these parents, it's become something that will bring a smile to their children's faces every day. \"It’s so impactful to me that her kindness and thoughtfulness and caring for gifts she’s going to give to children that she’s never met,\" Lisa Barron, the pediatric office supervisor at Palm Beach Children's Hospital, told WPBF 25 News. \"It is always inspiring when especially a young person wants to give back.\" \"She’s a regular teenage kid; she plays soccer and basketball, so she’s not having any issues,\" her father said. And today, Roosth is thinking of more ways to help others. \"It made feel really happy because like people cared about me,\" she said.

O conglomerado teve índice de reclamações de 34,11, com 791 registros procedentes, em um universo de 23,184 milhões de clientes. Em segundo lugar, ficou o Pagbank-PagSeguro, com índice de 20,35 e 633 reclamações procedentes e, em terceiro, o Bradesco (índice de 18,96 e 2.007 reclamações procedentes). O índice é calculado com base no número de reclamações consideradas procedentes, dividido pelo número de clientes da instituição, multiplicado por 1.000.000. Na prática, quanto maior o indicador, pior a classificação da instituição. O ranking é trimestral. Na [lista](https://midiamax.uol.com.br/tag/lista/) com as 15 maiores instituições, o Inter é a quarta mais reclamada (índice de 18,61), seguida de C6 Bank (15,23) e Santander (14,94).

    "title": "Eagles center Cam Jurgens underwent surgery to repair injury he played through in Super Bowl run",
    "text": "Sports\nEagles center Cam Jurgens underwent surgery to repair injury he played through in Super Bowl run\nPHILADELPHIA - Cam Jurgens underwent back surgery earlier this week to address an injury he played through during the Eagles' postseason run, according to league sources.\nESPN was first to report the news.\nThe 25-year-old center had the procedure to alleviate nerve pain and is expected to make a full recovery in time for training camp in July.\nJurgens played through significant pain both coming off the bench in the NFC championship game and returning to the starting lineup for the team's Super Bowl LIX victory. In the former, he pushed to be available as a reserve after a lengthy warm-up process before the game ended in the Eagles brain trust deciding he wasn't healthy enough to start.\nThe Eagles did in fact need him in the second half of their 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders after Landon Dickerson suffered a knee injury filling in for Jurgens at center, and Jurgens played well despite the diagnosis.\n\"These guys are playing through pain,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said after the game. \"I just can't say enough about how much I respect these guys of what they have to do with their bodies. I don't think anyone knows the half of it, what they have to do to play the long season.\"\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts added, \"That was really gritty of him.\"\nA former second-round pick out of Nebraska drafted as the heir apparent to Jason Kelce, Jurgens was up to the task of replacing the Eagles legend in his first season starting at center. He was named to the Pro Bowl and played an instrumental role in the Eagles' historic run game, often using his athleticism to get to the second level of the defense in a way reminiscent of Kelce to free Saquon Barkley on numerous occasions.\n\"It's big shoes to step into,\" Jurgens said. \"Whenever you go into the situation like that, and you think, ‘I need to fill this guy's shoes, I need to be like Kelce, I need to do this,' you're going to fail. I don't think anybody can succeed. I always look at it like I need to be the best person I can be. I need to fill my own shoes. I'm a damn good player and I just got to learn from my coaches, guys around me, and I just got to get better.\"\nAside from recovering from surgery, Jurgens' offseason may also include a contract extension considering he's entering the final year of his rookie deal. The Eagles have a track record of signing homegrown players early rather than waiting for the market to rise and are one year removed from signing DeVonta Smith and Landon Dickerson to long-term extensions off their rookie contracts shortly after they became eligible to do so.\nJurgens has a cap hit of $5.8 million for next season, although that could change with an extension. Going into free agency, Kansas City Chiefs center Creed Humphrey tops the center market with an annual salary of $18 million with a cluster of players sitting around $12 million annually filling out the rest of the top 5.\n---\nJeff McLane contributed reporting.\nCopyright (C) 2024, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
