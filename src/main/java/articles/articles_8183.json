    "text": "Despite facing setbacks earlier in the year with losses recorded in the second and third quarters, (INDEXASX: XMM) is set to rebound impressively in the fourth quarter, projecting a substantial 12.3% gain. Moreover, the mining industry experienced a flurry of high-profile mergers and acquisitions, reshaping the market dynamics significantly. China’s role in lifting commodity prices China's dominance as a steelmaker is expected to continue with an anticipated record-high in iron-ore imports. This surge in demand is primarily fueled by the limited inventories present at mills and ports, thereby driving prices upwards. Copper prices witnessed a notable surge, attributed to the increasing demand from China and closures of mines in Panama. The benchmark is projected to close the year with a 2.7% increase, showcasing the resilience of the copper market. Performance assessment of ASX mining stocks The year 2023 favored mining giants, with BHP (ASX: BHP) achieving a commendable 10.1% increase in its stock value. Similarly, Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO) and Fortescue (ASX: FMG) observed substantial gains of about 16.1% and 39.2%, respectively. These increments reflect positive market sentiments and strategic advancements made by these companies. A significant highlight in 2023 was BHP's strategic decision to sell its coal mines to Whitehaven in a deal worth $4.1 billion. This move signifies a strategic shift in BHP's focus and contributes to industry consolidation. The gold exploration sector is anticipated to register its most substantial yearly gain since 2016. This uptrend is largely attributed to thriving bullion prices amidst a weaker dollar, enticing investors towards gold-based assets. Contrary to other sectors, lithium stocks experienced a downturn in 2023. Major players like IGO (ASX: IGO) and Mineral Resources (ASX: MIN) recorded declines of approximately 32% and 9.9%, respectively, reflecting a challenging year for lithium-focused companies. Amidst a turbulent year, Liontown Resources (ASX: LTR) stood out with a commendable 22% increase in its stock value. However, this upward trajectory was followed by a crashed $4.2 billion takeover bid by Albemarle, creating an element of unpredictability in its trajectory. In terms of significant industry developments, OZ Minerals (ASX: OZL) and Newcrest (ASX: NCM) were acquired in multi-billion dollar deals, while Allkem underwent a merger during the year.",

    "text": "The Golden. Like Cortes and the conquistadors who crossed the ocean in search of treasure. Or the American pioneers, obsessed with nugget hunting. Today it seems like a game a new gold rush. The safe haven par excellence, evaluated 60 euros per gram it is a safe investment. Especially in times that see the succession of wars, ranging from Ukraine to the Middle East, inflation that is once again scary and the rise in interest rates that seems unstoppable. Gold sparkles (once again) like the safe haven to shelter during the storm. The price of gold The price increase is caused by various factors, but the main reason is to be found in geopolitical instability which has been affecting the planet for several years. In other words: The gold rush is fueled by fear. A motto often used by analysts goes like this: «The engine of the global [economy](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/economy/) is much more often linked to emotion than to rationality». However, there are also other factors to consider. For example the general increase in public debts, the large amount of liquidity that was generated in response to the 2008 crisis and, finally, the fact that a large part of the [world](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/world/)’s central banks continue to increase their gold reserves. The price of gold has always seemed to show a inverse correlation with interest rates. That is, when the cost of money increases, the demand for gold decreases. As well as its value. Trivially, because other investments guarantee greater profits. Yet today, although rates remain high, the price of gold shows no signs of decreasing. Indeed, in 2024 it is estimated that the price of gold is destined to reach its historic highs. Since it appears almost certain that the rise in interest rates will come to an end. And, on the other hand, it is easy to hypothesize that [international](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/international/) conflicts will not end. The “goldsmith” Turin Thus, gold coins are back in fashion. And the same goes for jewelry and precious stones. As luck would have it, Turin has a highly respectable tradition in this area. The establishment in the city of the Cartier factory. The factory opened its doors at the beginning of 2023 and immediately brought a breath of fresh air to the neighborhood. It also seems that in recent weeks too George Clooney paid a visit to the factory. For further [information](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/information/), read also: A growing sector The companies that deal with gold and jewels in Piedmont are: 1,168 as of June 30, 2023 versus 1,151 as of June 30, 2022 (a growth that interrupted the decline recorded in recent years resulting from cessations of activity but also from concentrations due to progressive acquisitions by consolidated groups). The province of Alessandria confirms itself as queen with its district of Valenza (848 companies, there were 830 in June 2022), followed by Turin with 218 companies (there were 221 last year) which appears to be decidedly detached from all the other provinces. 2023-12-28 19:28:00 #gold #rush #begins #Shelter #storm",

    "text": "By Lauren Bennett, Ph.D.\nLike a flower growing in a garden, the human brain benefits from the great outdoors. Nature walks. A jog around the neighborhood. Tai Chi at the park. Studies have found that the aging brain shrinks less when a person spends time outdoors. The same protection against brain shrinkage occurs when a person exercises.\nCombine the two – time outdoors and time spent exercising – and you have a powerful prescription that may help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.\nWhether you’re walking, gardening, or birding, being active can play a role in maintaining cognitive health and improving mood. In fact, a study out of England found that walking just under 10,000 steps a day reduces a person’s risk of developing dementia by 50 percent.\nIf brain health is grounded in whole body health, what can you do to benefit your body and your mind? Get outside and …\nWalk. Simply walking 30 minutes a day helps maintain your cardiovascular health and, subsequently, your brain health.\nDance or Practice Yoga or Tai Chi. It seems dance may improve or slow the worsening in the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, yoga reduces brain shrinkage and tai chi helps delay cognitive impairment in people with dementia.\nPaint, Sing or Play an Instrument. Studies into the arts suggest that singing, painting and other artistic activities can improve cognition in people with mild dementia.\nSee your doctor. OK. This is an indoor activity, but it’s an important one. Hoag’s Orange County Vital Brain Program offers primary care physicians tools and education to provide patients with baseline assessments and screenings. We work with your doctor to help you identify early signs of cognitive decline – and direct you to the help you might need.\nEarly intervention can significantly impact the course of dementia and improve quality of life for both patients and their families.

    "text": "A flyer from a Food Basics store four years ago is causing a stir online after users noted the soaring cost of grocery items since then.\nThe flyer from 2020 was shared to the Toronto Reddit board over the weekend, revealing prices as low as $2.99 per pound for chicken thighs or drumsticks and a deal for two one-litre containers of chocolate milk for $3. Last January, a five-pack of chicken breast from a Toronto Loblaws caught the ire of many shoppers for it’s nearly $12.25 per pound pricing.\nFood Basics flyer from 2020...\nby u/Equivalent-Net-7496 in toronto Over 200 people commented on the thread, seemingly gobsmacked that watermelon had recently cost less than $3 and that two bags of Doritos were on sale for $5.\n“I saw a post from someone bringing a Food Basics flyer from 2000,” Juan Castro, who posted the flyer to Reddit, told CTV News Toronto. “I remember when everything was 99 cents [then]. But I said to myself, ‘Will that be possible to get a flyer of, let’s say 2020, around the pandemic.’”\n“You were able to get a box of spaghetti [for] less than $2 and that same box costs $6 [now] at the same supermarkets,” Castro said.\nSome grocery shoppers who spoke with CTV News shared their thoughts on the four-year-old flyer, expressing how “enticing” the prices are and how they would likely buy more if items hovered at these costs nowadays.\n“There’s a combination of feelings,” Castro said. At first, unhappiness because it costs more to pay for quality products like fruit, Castro said, but then secondly, resignation.\n“You need to just accept whatever you can get for the money you have.”\nSylvain Charlebois, Senior Director of Dalhousie University’s Agri-Food Analytics Lab, told CTV News Toronto in an interview that looking back in time to see how food prices have wavered is important, but ultimately, with inflation, “we should expect food prices to continue to rise.”\n“My other observations were that all of the products on the flyer are from CPG companies, major multinationals,” Charlebois said. Some examples of CPG companies(opens in a new tab) – Consumer Packaged Goods – are Nestle, General Mills and PepsiCo.\n“I’ve always [found] it quite odd that a lot of people are pointing fingers at grocers.”\nCharlebois explained these manufacturers will pay grocers to carry their products, and provide a list of suggested prices for each product. However, he adds it’s up to the grocer to decide what to do with that list.\n“Sometimes they actually will go below to offer what we call ‘loss leaders’ to generate more traffic. So, in this case, you’re looking at flyers and a lot of people actually think that flyers are all about products that are on sale – not necessarily,” Charlebois said. “Sometimes you may actually end up seeing products and the intent is to inform the public that they actually carry that product […] So, that’s why you need to do your homework to compare prices as much as possible.”\nWHAT CAN SHOPPERS EXPECT THIS YEAR? Canada’s Food Price Report for 2024 , published in December, predicts costs will rise somewhere between 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent as inflation continues to moderate.\nThe report’s researchers predict a family of four will spend about $700 more on food this year compared to 2023 , for an annual estimate of $16,297.20.\nCharlebois says that since most grocery shoppers aren’t loyal to one company, grocers will need to offer good deals to draw them to their aisles – though not necessarily to the prices seen from four years ago.\n“We are expecting many of the products that are being displayed [in that flyer] to be more affordable,” Charlebois said.\nThere aren’t any factors that could push food prices any higher than they are right now, Charlebois said, adding prices are expected to stabilize over time.\n“No matter what Ottawa does, prices are stabilizing.”\nRelated Stories The average family is expected to spend $700 more on groceries in 2024.

It was amazing. We need them because if we don’t the world would be a disaster,\" Lane Foglogle said.\nProper training like this can help those with special needs better deal with these local heroes when necessary.\n“It's different for everybody but there could be light sensitivity to the flashing lights. A lot of sound sensitivity with all the sirens and especially if there's a dramatic situation in the house, having also another source come in. It can be very overstimulating for anyone involved,\" Kendall Clark, a social worker intern at Baylor University, said.",

    "text": "Money Report In partnership with Artificial Intelligence How AI regulation in California, Colorado and beyond could threaten US tech dominance By Rachel Curry,CNBC • Published November 21, 2024 • Updated 16 mins ago William_potter | Istock | Getty Images California's recently vetoed state bill on safe and secure artificial intelligence systems could put the state's status as a technology hub at risk. In 2024, AI bills have been introduced in 45 states plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But at the federal level, the U.S. is one of the only G20 nations to not have a comprehensive data privacy law like the EU's GDPR. The U.S. and, more specifically, California's Silicon Valley, are technology hubs of the highest degree. Along with that designation comes an expectation of consistent innovation.\nFree 24/7 Connecticut news stream: Watch NBC CT wherever you are\nDespite California's recently vetoed state bill on \"safe and secure innovation for frontier artificial intelligence systems,\" U.S. tech leaders remain on edge. California's status as a national and global technology hub could be at risk of stifled innovation, opponents to similar legislation say.\n\"Regulating basic technology will put an end to innovation,\" Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, wrote on X .\nGet top local stories in Connecticut delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Connecticut's News Headlines newsletter. In 2024, AI bills have been introduced in 45 states plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Colorado AI Act — which requires a developer of a high-risk AI system to avoid algorithmic discrimination — is the first of its kind to be signed into law in the U.S. and was even ahead of the European Union AI Act.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed California's bill at the end of September but signed into law another bill which requires transparency in generative AI systems. Some of the critiques of the vetoed bill remain relevant in potential future regulation in California and beyond. The AI Alliance , a self-proclaimed community of creators, developers and adopters in the AI space, worries certain regulations \"would slow innovation, thwart advancements in safety and security and undermine California's economic growth.\"\nDemocratic California state senator Scott Weiner of District 11 (which includes San Francisco), authored the vetoed bill. He spoke at the AI Quality Conference in June about the bill and stated, \"As human beings, we have a tendency to ignore risk until there's a problem.\" Wiener clarified that the bill did not intend to interfere with startup innovation, but rather keep tabs on \"very large, powerful models\" by requiring a minimum training budget of $100 million for specified company types.\nMoney Report\nnews 2 hours ago Treasury yields fall as investors weigh state of U.S. economy news 4 hours ago Battery giant Northvolt files for bankruptcy in major setback to Europe's EV ambitions Tatiana Rice, deputy director for U.S. legislation at non-profit, non-partisan think tank Future of Privacy Forum, said the U.S. as a whole is in a unique position given the fact that it's one of the only G20 nations to not have a comprehensive data privacy law (similar to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation , or GDPR). \"A lot of the privacy risks associated with AI can be tackled through a comprehensive data privacy regime,\" she said.\nThe U.S. has historically approached data privacy with decentralized, state-by-state legislation, which is where AI regulation is currently headed. While the formerly introduced American Data Privacy and Protection Act (which has since been replaced with the proposed American Privacy Rights Act ) tried to tackle data privacy at the federal level, it quickly became a culture war because of civil rights protections included in the text.\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has published a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights based on five principles: safe and effective systems; algorithmic discrimination protection; data privacy; notice and explanation; and human alternatives, consideration and fallback. But with a new administration on the way in, and President-elect Trump's approach to regulation expected to be more favorable to corporations — though there are critics of big tech within his ranks — the White House may reverse course and bring the federal approach to AI in line with a broader ethos of minimal government involvement to drive competitive technological innovation. In that case, the onus will remain at the state level, where individual states will have to toe the line between tech hub status and secure innovation.\n'Common-sense AI regulation' At the state level, Jonas Jacobi, CEO of ValidMind, an AI risk management company for financial institutions, said, \"The wrong regulation can absolutely kill innovation.\" But, he added, \"that doesn't mean there shouldn't be regulation. There should be common-sense regulation, especially around these huge foundational models, which are incredibly powerful.\"\nMohamed Elgendy, CEO of AI and ML testing platform Kolena, has a slightly different view. \"Setting the threshold on the brain power of the model versus the application, it just doesn't make sense,\" he said. In this, Elgendy is differentiating models, like GPT, from their applications, like ChatGPT.\n\"The way I see the risks of AI is really not about the capability of it,\" Elgendy said. \"It's on the security side, that malicious use.\" Jacobi echoes this part of the sentiment. \"I don't think you can hold [developers] accountable for everything that happens when people use their models,\" he said.\nRice says U.S. companies threatening to leave their home states for an overreach of AI regulation have some say, but that it would take a lot for California's tech hub to dissipate. Despite state-by-state fragmentation, Rice said there are people working to find a model approach.\nSenator Robert Rodriguez, a Democratic majority leader of the Colorado Senate, and Democratic Connecticut State Senator James Maroney are two people \"trying to be cognizant of avoiding a patchwork of AI regulations in the way that has happened with data privacy,\" said Rice. Regarding Colorado's successful AI bill, Maroney wrote on Facebook , \"It is unfortunate that Connecticut chose not to join Colorado as a leader in this space. But we will be back with a bill next year.\"\nEven a model approach, if done wrong, could pose a major risk to the U.S. \"Everybody's looking at California, especially when it comes to tech,\" Elgendy said. If anything, companies could leave the entire country, which would be a nightmare from a cybersecurity perspective, he said.\nElgendy's company is currently in the midst of a nine-month case study of sorts to develop AI \"gold standards\" by working with regulatory bodies for sectors like finance and ecommerce. Kolena is aiming to have an actionable set of guidelines and standards that can provide clear guidance for builders and regulators across these major industries, filling the void that has so far been left by federal lawmakers and regulators.\nEven without congressional movement, Elgendy noted, industry leaders will make progress. \"We definitely believe that no one team can do this alone,\" he said.\nAlso on CNBC The hardest part of deploying gen AI for most companies Nate Silver: Don't trust the Trump swing in election polls, prediction markets What's behind the latest odds in 2024 presidential election: Nate Silver Subscribe to the CNBC YouTube Channel Morning Squawk Newsletter Copyright CNBC This article tagged under: Artificial Intelligence news on now Live: NBC CT News Today @ 6AM Trending Stories Colleges & Universities New state program could reimburse student loan borrowers Donald Trump Trump names longtime ally Pam Bondi as his new attorney general pick hours after Matt Gaetz withdraws Bloomfield Preserving history: Bloomfield makes decision following library name controversy StormTracker Parts of Connecticut could get up to 2 inches of snow overnight Weather Forecast",
