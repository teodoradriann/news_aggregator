    "text": "DAYTON, Ohio (WKEF) -- Jeff Schmitt Auto Group announced Donna Ruff as its 2023 Jeff's Hero in recognition of her commitment to the animal community through Ruff Rescue Transport. Ruff Rescue Transport, which was established in 2015, has helped nearly 15,000 cats and dogs. The organization provides critical transportation for animals in distress, ensuring their safe journey to shelters and dedicated volunteers. Throughout 2023 there were four finalists announced for the Jeff’s Heroes initiative. Each finalist received a check for $5,000 from Jeff Schmitt Auto Group to help support their impact in the community. Voting was opened to anyone to pick their favorite Jeff's Hero beginning in December. After thousands of votes, Donna was selected as the winner. The award for the 2023 Jeff’s Hero was planned to be $10,000 cash and up to $20,000 towards a new vehicle. After speaking with Ruff, it was learned that her vehicle needs were already being met, so a check was presented to her for $30,000. \"Donna Ruff and Ruff Rescue Transport are doing amazing things to help thousands of animals in need,\" said Jay Schmitt, president of the Jeff Schmitt Auto Group. \"My wife and I adopted our dog Maya from the Humane Society of Greater Dayton in March. It was only after meeting Donna for the first time that I learned that she helped transport Maya and her littermates from a kill-shelter in Kentucky all the way up to Dayton where they could find their forever homes. Congratulations to Donna, and to all of the Jeff’s Heroes finalists that I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know this year.” More about Donna and the Jeff's Hero initiative can be found at [www.jeffdeals.com](https://www.jeffdeals.com/jeffs-heroes/).

    "text": "The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) organised a two-day training programme on the “Use of ornamental plants for landscaping”, to keep the city dwellers and villagers aligned with the latest trends of landscaping. Dr Kuldeep Singh, head, department of extension education and associate director (skill development), observed that the floriculture and landscaping has proved to be a sustainable lucrative business as the demand for flowers as well as ornamental plants has always seen a spurt in hotels, educational institutions, community places and parks, religious places, homes, farm houses, etc. Be it small- or large-scale floral business, farmers, nurseries and amateurs are earning substantially, thus changing the entire socio-economic landscape of the concerned rural and urban citizens, he added. The programme coordinator Prerna Kapila said that the training programme was planned keeping in the mind the rising preference for the use of ornamental plants for landscaping at the rooftop of the houses, farms or other surrounding areas. The resource persons Parminder Singh, head, department of floriculture and landscaping; KK Dhatt, Rishu Sharma, Ranjit Singh, Tanya Thakur, Simrat Singh, Madhu Bala and Aman Sharma whetted the skills of the trainees on different aspects of landscaping. They laid specific thrust on the selection of site and plants, their maintenance as per the season, and their reuse as well as rejuvenation through newly evolved agricultural technologies. In his welcome remarks, expert Dilpreet Talwar said that the domestic and commercial cultivation of flowers as well as ornamental plants was picking up to add greenery as well as for beautification and idyllic atmosphere. He informed that the trainees also visited a nursery for gaining practical experience and becoming familiar with different ornamental plants. PAU hosts webinar on communication skillsThe PAU’s department of extension education, in collaboration with the communication centre, organised a webinar to enhance communication skills among university experts, scientists, Krishi Vigyan Kendra professionals and extension workers.The webinar featured speakers, including former additional director of communication Dr Ranjit Singh and Dr Jagwinder Singh, editor of Punjabi at the communication centre.

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Four gunmen jumped out of a red sedan and unloaded a hail of bullets on a Dallas shopping center while bystanders ate breakfast and engaged in idle chit-chat. Security footage, which was released by Dallas police on Wednesday, shows four hooded and masked suspects running through the parking lot and unloading their weapons into an unsuspecting crowd. Stephanie Sharpe's brother, 51-year-old Moreland Smith, was there to eat breakfast when he died in the shooting. Jamarcus Irving, 22, was also killed. \\\"People were ducking and diving, other people. They didn’t care,\\\" Sharpe told NBC 5 Dallas. \\\"For me, it is still unreal. It’s been very difficult for me as a sister to lay my older brother down.\\\" HITMAN'S NITROGEN GAS EXECUTION THURSDAY SPARKS CONTROVERSY: WHAT TO KNOW The four suspects who terrorized the shopping center shortly after 9 a.m. two days after Christmas are still on the run a month later. Dallas police released the security video on Wednesday and hope tips will pour in. POTENTIAL CULT CALLED ‘SOLDIERS OF CHRIST’ LIKELY BEAT WOMAN TO DEATH ‘TO EXORCISE DEMON SPIRIT’: EXPERT The shopping center seemed quiet as the gunmen drove a red Nissan Sentra into the parking lot while two men talked in the background. The car stopped. The gunmen jumped out, and gunshots rang out. Sharpe, who was at the scene on December 27, told the local news outlet that grief still has her in its grasp while law enforcements hunt down the killers. \\\"Somebody knows something,\\\" Sharpe told NBC 5 Dallas, which reported that a memorial has grown where the two men were killed. \\\"That is somebody’s friend, that is somebody’s child. Somebody knows something,\\\" Sharpe said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dallas police offered a $5,000 Crimestoppers reward for any information.

    "title": "Los tres alimentos que reducen el riesgo de demencia, recomendados por Harvard",
    "text": "Una investigación reciente promovida por Harvard revela que ciertos alimentos pueden ser clave en la prevención de la demencia y el deterioro cognitivo. Uma Naidoo, directora de psiquiatría nutricional, estilo de vida y metabólica del Hospital General de Massachusetts, vinculado a la prestigiosa universidad, afirma que la alimentación juega un papel crucial en el cuidado de la salud cerebral “Comer alimentos que estimulan el cerebro puede reducir significativamente el riesgo de desarrollar problemas neurológicos, mejorar la salud mental y ayudar a mantenerse lúcido y concentrado”, indicó Naidoo, destacando la importancia de una dieta equilibrada en la función cognitiva. Naidoo señaló también que los antioxidantes, que se encuentran de manera abundante en los alimentos de origen vegetal, tienen un impacto positivo. \"Quizás la parte más emocionante de la ciencia apunta al hecho de que los antioxidantes, esos compuestos que se encuentran en los alimentos vegetales que ayudan a combatir el estrés oxidativo y reducen el riesgo de enfermedades crónicas, ahora también están vinculados a mejorar la función cerebral, el estado de ánimo y la salud cognitiva\", subrayó la especialista. Entre los alimentos que recomienda para reducir el riesgo de demencia, destacan tres frutas y frutos con propiedades neuroprotectoras. (Lea: ¿Está prohibido entrar comida a las salas de cine? Esto es lo que dice la ley al respecto en Colombia). Naidoo no duda en afirmar que las bayas son su fruta favorita. “Las bayas son mi fruta favorita”, comentó. Según la experta, estas frutas tienen un índice glucémico bajo, lo que las convierte en una excelente opción para añadir a la dieta diaria sin elevar los niveles de azúcar en sangre. Además, sus colores vivos son indicativos de la presencia de polifenoles, compuestos que aportan un potente efecto antioxidante. Estas propiedades, junto con la riqueza en flavonoides, folatos y fibra, benefician no solo al sistema digestivo, sino también a la salud mental.
