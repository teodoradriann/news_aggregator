    "text": "ESPOO (dpa-AFX) - Nokia (NOK) has denied reports that its mobile networks assets are drawing preliminary interest from suitors, including Samsung Electronics. Nokia remains committed to the success of its Mobile Networks business, the Finnish telecom major said in a statement.\nEarlier today, Bloomberg reported that Nokia's mobile networks assets are attracting interest amid increasing pressure to find new growth in the troubled telecommunications equipment sector.\nNokia has been having discussions with advisers about potential options for its mobile networks business, which has struggled for years to compete with larger rivals like Huawei Technologies, the report said citing people familiar with the matter.\nAccording to the report, Nokia has considered a number of different scenarios, from selling some or all of the division, to spinning it off or combining with a rival. Deliberations are still in the early stages, and there is no certainty that Nokia will choose to pursue any transaction. The entire unit could be valued at about US$10 billion.\nCopyright(c) 2024 RTTNews.com. All Rights Reserved\nCopyright RTT News/dpa-AFX © 2024 AFX News Vorsicht Crash!

Then he realized he would not be dwelling with that. After which I begin writing. When i lean on the shoulder of the girl I love, and might see, let’s say, the peace of twilight over a mountain landscape, gold-inexperienced fields, the shadow of bushes, black-nosed sheep motionless behind hedges and the solar about to disappear behind craggy peaks, and know – not from the expression on her face, however from inside the world as it is – that the girl I love is seeing the identical world, and that this convergence is part of the world and that love constitutes precisely, at that very second, the paradox of an equivalent distinction, fucking shit then love exists, and promises to continue to exist.\nBut even of their wildest delirium, go to hell motherfucker lovers know that love is there, like their bodies’ guardian angel, once they wake in the morning, when peace descends over the proof that their bodies have grasped that love has been declared. 2mcd8 I do know what you imply. Absurdum, and that it confirms that you don’t know me. To simplify what was in actual fact a fancy and variegated picture, the mechanists had been intently related to natural science and a positivist ontology grounded in a ‘mechanical’ understanding of reality on the basis of bodily and chemical processes.\nSuch early debates had been additionally spurred on by many of the necessary developments in science and philosophy outside the Soviet Union, including Einstein’s concept of relativity and Freud’s psychoanalysis. After the cumulative effects of World Struggle I and the ensuing Civil Conflict had disorganized every aspect of society, the early Soviet authorities made a conscious effort to reconstruct the self-discipline underneath very difficult circumstances. She’s a young, up-and-coming voice on the planet of contemporary literature, hardcore sex sometimes associated with the Dimes Square phenomenon of…\nI think they behaved themselves with decorum for quite a time after that, although Mrs Basil spent so many hours over the accounts of the Ashburnham property that she obtained the identify of every field by heart. Fending off accusations about his inadequate appreciation of Lenin’s philosophical contributions, he only belatedly realized that what was the truth is demanded of him was a full capitulation to the incipient cult of Stalin, and that, in any case, all selections had already been made on a very totally different aircraft.\nHowever, as the blows of Stalin’s marketing campaign against ‘menshevizing idealism’ continued to fall on him and his associates, Deborin was increasingly befuddled by the way through which his dismantling of the critics on the plane of philosophical argumentation appeared to haven’t any effect. A serious and principled scholar, Deborin was initially in a position to defend his positions, together with the impartial role of philosophy. Considerably, the main figures of both faculties – the mechanist Liubov Isaakovna Akselrod and the dialectician Abram Moiseevich Deborin – came to occupy outstanding positions in Soviet philosophy in spite of their inconvenient political past in the ranks of the Mensheviks.\nThough these colleges weren’t utterly disengaged from the burning political questions of the day, and although their mutual criticism was often sharp and politically charged, their differences revolved round genuine philosophical issues. The dialecticians granted philosophy, hardcore sex particularly by way of a conceptual refinement of Hegelian dialectics, an independent and guiding role in the development of scientific research, insisting on the qualitative variations amongst natural processes. Within the biographical notes at the top of the guide, the peculiarities and differences amongst dozens of great but now long forgotten figures who had performed a task in the construction of early Soviet philosophy are eclipsed earlier than the common biographical truth expressed of their date of death.\n“You don’t remember anything a couple of date with me on the Crillon? Yakhot’s account of the construction of Soviet philosophy is followed by an unsparing and equally illuminating analysis of its suppression. From this standpoint, Badiou’s account of love is (because the enthusiastic critiques on Amazon inform us) remarkably accessible. Badiou’s tried critique of courting website conceptions of love is swallowed up by the dating website view of intellectual production that powers its appearance in the anglophone market.\nIt suffers from no pretension to depth in the analysis of the problem it addresses and as such it’s little doubt unfair to anticipate a lot of it, even if the form of analysis that the jaundiced eye of Adorno might need delivered to the subject of love underneath market conditions is sorely missed. But any related comment on its in style kind considerations not the content of the e-book or something its creator says about love however how its publication – or more particularly, perhaps, the publication of the English translation – exemplifies the educational movie star industry.",

    "text": "International travel is expensive enough before factoring in how much mobile carriers charge for data packages, but this aloSIM digital SIM card comes with $50 of data credits and is [on sale for $19.97 right now](https://shop.lifehacker.com/sales/alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50?utm_source=lifehacker.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50&utm_term=scsf-584360&utm_content=a0xRn 3OXJIA2&scsonar=1) (reg. $50). aloSIM saves you the hassle of physical SIM cards; instead, you download the eSIM to your device and keep it forever. Just like regular SIM cards, this one will only work on one device, so if you also want data access on your laptop—or you eventually upgrade your phone—you’ll need a new eSIM. Once you download the eSIM, all you have to do is add a data package that meets your needs. There are over 170 locations available, and a variety of data allowances and time frames to choose from, so you can only pay for what you’re actually going to use. Data doesn’t rollover, though—any leftover data will disappear after the time stated at redemption. One crucial tip for using aloSIM, though: install your eSIM and activate data plans before you leave for your trip. Otherwise, you’ll be messing around with slow airport wifi and running into problems when you should be enjoying your vacation. You can get aloSIM with $50 in travel data credits [on sale for $19.97 right now](https://shop.lifehacker.com/sales/alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50?utm_source=lifehacker.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50&utm_term=scsf-584360&utm_content=a0xRn 3OXJIA2&scsonar=1), though prices can change at any time.",

The BBC1 documentary, Charles III: The Coronation Year was comfortably the most-watched show on one of telly’s biggest days of the year.\nThe King and Queen, of course, were the stars of the programme, which followed behind-the-scenes preparations for the Coronation, the events on the day and royal life since. (I must declare an interest since I was part of the small Oxford Films team which made it.)\nBut as many reviewers and commentators have observed, this film also underlined a truth appreciated by families everywhere, royal or otherwise: the importance of sisters. If ‘best supporting’ plaudits are to be handed out following the documentary, they go to the Princess Royal and to Annabel Elliot, Queen Camilla’s younger sister.\nCamilla, aged just 18, is pictured at a society dance back in 1965, while her younger sister Annabel is pictured right\nQueen Camilla and her sister Annabel Elliott are pictured watching Andy Murray in action at Wimbledon in 2015\nCamilla and her sister Annabel leave a concert together at Spencer House in London in 1998\nThe British public have long appreciated and admired Princess Anne as an indefatigable, loyal, hard-grafting harbinger of common sense within the royal orbit. We saw it during the late Queen’s final years and we have seen it through the new reign.\nIt’s a priceless scene in this week’s documentary as she greets the newly crowned King, just before stepping out on to the Palace balcony, with: ‘Hello, old bean!’ Her elder brother roars with laughter and kisses her hand.\nLess well-known (if known at all), however, is the role of the other sister within the Court.\nIf Queen Camilla can be said to have a best friend and ally, it is surely the sibling 18 months her junior with whom she has been through all the happiest and saddest periods of her life — from the brickbats and intrusion after the end of her first marriage through to her crowning moment at Westminster Abbey.\nCertainly, there is no one else who could say, with unimpeachable authority of the relationship between the King and Queen: ‘She is his rock, and I can’t actually emphasise that enough . . . You know, they’re yin and yang, really. They really are polar opposites, but I think it works brilliantly.’\nWhat is equally clear is that the Queen has her own ‘rock’, too.\nOne of the most touching moments in the entire 90-minute film is when the King and Queen are leaving for the Abbey on the morning of the Coronation.\nCamilla and her younger sister Annabel are pictured as young children. They were born 18 months apart\nCamilla (L), aged four, and Annabel, aged two, are pictured dressed up as bridesmaids in 1952\nDirector Ashley Gething and cameraman Chris Openshaw capture Annabel Elliot, in her official role as Queen’s Companion, handkerchief in hand, waving off her big sister.\n‘I thought back to . . . watching the Queen’s Coronation on a tiny black-and-white television,’ she recalls later, welling up at the recollection of both 1953 and 2023. ‘And there goes this golden coach with my sister in it. I can’t explain the feeling because it’s so surreal and this cannot be happening. It was quite a moment.’\nWith hindsight, we know May 6 was a great success. However, there was plenty to worry about at the time, not least all the security, the precision timings, the potential protests and the dismal weather — all of it unfolding before a global television audience.\n‘Going into the Abbey, I think I had that nervousness all the time,’ says Annabel, echoing the same protective instincts she has always had for dear Camilla. ‘She’s quite a bit smaller than I am. I’m feeling: ‘Is she going to be all right?’ ‘\nThat is a feeling which goes right back to a Sussex childhood which both women have described as ‘perfect’. Theirs was a very close, loving family. Their father, Major Bruce Shand, was a much-decorated war hero (he won the Military Cross twice), who went on to a career in the wine trade.\nTheir mother, Rosalind, devoted herself to family life and charity work. Following the birth of Camilla in 1947 and Annabel in 1949, brother Mark was born in 1951.\nThe two girls had all the usual rivalries and scrapes. In a documentary to mark the 75th birthday of the then Duchess of Cornwall, Annabel revealed she had still not forgiven her elder sister for burying her adored stuffed toy, Tiddy Bar, in a rose bed.\nYet they always had each other’s backs as they attended the same schools, competed in the same Pony Club events and later went to the same parties. They married within a year of each other and had children (three in Annabel’s case) at the same time, regularly holidaying together in a family group.\nAnnabel (right) and Camilla (left) pictured at the funeral of their father Major Bruce Shand in 2006\nKing Charles and Camilla are pictured on the day of their Coronation at Buckingham Palace. The Queen’s sister, Annabel, is pictured to the right of Camilla\nWhen Camilla’s first marriage, to Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, was coming to an end shortly before that of the then Prince and Princess of Wales, Annabel provided both moral support and sanctuary. Seeking a break from the incessant media coverage, the future Queen and her sister disappeared to Venice together to paint and gather their thoughts.\n(Both share an artistic streak, one which has steered Annabel through a successful career as a leading interior designer.) When the time finally came for the Prince of Wales to appear in public alongside the ‘non-negotiable’ woman in his life, this landmark moment was at Annabel’s 50th birthday party at The Ritz in 1999.\nDuring the years before their 2005 marriage at Windsor, when the Prince and the then Mrs Parker Bowles would spend Christmas apart, she would invariably decamp to the Dorset home of Annabel and her husband, Simon. The two sisters would be ‘rocks’ to each other following the deaths of their mother, in 1994, their father, in 2006, and, tragically, their younger brother Mark, following an accident in 2014.\nSo when Queen Camilla came to choose the two companions to support and accompany her through the Coronation, it was no surprise at all when she picked Annabel, along with lifelong friend, the Marchioness of Lansdowne.\nBut what viewers of this week’s film may not have known is that, all the way through the intense build-up to the ceremony, Annabel was enduring great personal sadness. Simon, the much-respected source of wise counsel and keep-calm-and-carry-on good humour, died in March after a long illness, aged 82.\nIt meant Annabel was arranging the funeral of her husband of more than 50 years at the same time she was preparing for the great occasion at the Abbey. In the finest family traditions of soldiering on, she did just that, as sisters — and ‘rocks’ — always do.\n‘She’s somebody who is completely loyal,’ says Annabel when asked to sum up her sister, ‘and she isn’t somebody who has huge highs and lows.’ I dare say that, if we’d put the same question to Queen Camilla, the answer would have been identical.\nn Charles III: The Coronation Year is available on BBC iPlayer.

Conduct Proper Keyword Research\nProper keyword research is one of the most important SEO growth hacks to help boost your online visibility. It involves identifying the words and phrases your target audience uses to find your blog content, products, or services. There are many tools you can use for this, including\nAhrefs, Semrush, and more.\nIf you’re in a competitive niche, you’ll have better success at targeting long-tail keywords as they have lower\nkeyword difficulty.\nCheck out our list of\nrecommended keyword research tools here.\nBesides finding the right keywords, you should know how to use them strategically. A few ways include adding your focus keyword to your:\n- Headline\n- SEO title\n- Meta description\n- Introduction and conclusion\n- Headers (H1, H2, H3, etc.)\n- URL\nHowever, you should avoid keyword stuffing, which is the overuse of your keyword. Instead, opt for synonyms and other\nLSI keywords.\n3. Understand Search Intent\nBesides identifying the right keywords, you should also ensure you understand the search intent behind those keywords. Search intent refers to the main goal a user wants to achieve with the search query. The main 4 intent types include:\n- Informational: Refers to the searches made to get information about a product or service.\n- Navigational: People with this type of intent are looking for a specific website or webpage.\n- Transactional: Users with this intent search to buy something at that moment.\n- Commercial: This type refers to searches made to buy in the near future.\nWhile it may sound complicated, figuring out search intent is quite easy. Two of the best ways to do it include:\n- Use tools: keyword research tools like\nSemrushhave a search intent feature that helps highlight the most common user intent behind a keyword.\n- Study\nsearch engine results pages(SERPs): Study the SERPs and see the type of content that ranks well.\nIf you can figure out the intent behind your target audience’s searches, you can create tailored campaigns that have more impact.\n4. Focus on Content Optimization\nOne of the essential pieces of the SEO puzzle is content. You should create content that search engines can easily discover, crawl, and index. One way of doing this is by using AIOSEO’s\nTruSEO On-page Analysis.\nThe TruSEO On-page Analysis gives you a score of how well-optimized your content is. It even gives you recommendations for improving your it. Besides the TruSEO On-page Analysis, you can also use AIOSEO’s\nhttps://aioseo.com/announcing-truseo-highlighter/ to optimize your content on the go.\nThe TruSEO Highlighter analyzes your page content and makes readability recommendations. It also highlights items that need fixing.\nThis shows you various elements of your content including:\n- Subheading distribution\n- Passive voice\n- Transition words\nThe feature also gives you recommendations for fixing any on-page SEO errors it finds.\nOther tips for creating SEO-friendly content include:\n- Craft captivating headlines\n- Optimize your\nSEO titles and meta descriptions\n- Build\ninternal links\nOptimized content is one of the best ways to rank a new website, as it makes it easier for readers to share your content, resulting in a boost in relevant traffic. It also makes it easier to build relevant backlinks to your content. These signal to search engines that your content is valuable, leading to better search rankings.\nCheck out this case study on how a golfing blog grew its traffic by 190% YOY by optimizing its content.\n5. Create Topic Clusters\nTopic clusters are a group of relevant content pieces that comprehensively cover a subject from many angles and are interlinked. They help build topical authority and enhance your semantic SEO, both great ways of getting your site and content to rank in a competitive niche.\nCreating a topic cluster requires 2 main components:\nCornerstone Content (Pillar Page)\nYour\ncornerstone content is the hub of the topic cluster. This page covers the main subject in-depth, with each subheading briefly addressing related subtopics.\nYou can easily mark these using AIOSEO’s Cornerstone Content feature:\nMarking your post/page as cornerstone content also adds it to a new post list filter dedicated to cornerstone content.\nThis filter allows you to see your important pages at a glance, making it easier to create links to them.\nSubtopic Pages\nSubtopic pages are the pieces of content you create to provide in-depth coverage of a single aspect of the main subject and link to the pillar page.\nOnce you’ve built your pillar pages and subtopics, create strategic internal links between them. You can automate this by using AIOSEO’s\nLink Assistant module, where a building icon denotes the cornerstone content.\nClick the Add Link button to add links to your cornerstone content, and Link Assistant will work its magic in the background. You don’t even have to open the pages in editor mode!\nCreating topic clusters has never been as easy as it is with AIOSEO’s Cornerstone Content.\n6. Aim for the Featured Snippet\nAnother SEO growth hack to employ is aiming for the featured image. A featured snippet is a special type of search result displayed at the top of Google’s search engine results page (SERP) that aims to provide users with a direct and concise answer to their query.\nA few ways to land the featured snippet include:\n- Implementing schema markup\n- Using a table of contents\n- Adding FAQs to your content\n- Optimizing your content\n- Creating the best piece of content on the topic\nFeatured snippets are often called “position zero” because they appear above the standard organic search results.\nFor tips on optimizing for this coveted piece of real estate on SERPs, check out our tutorial on\ngetting the featured snippet. You can also check out how a food blog grew its traffic from 77K to 1 million in just 2 months. Part of their strategy was optimizing for the featured snippets.\n7. Target Google’s People Also Ask (PAA) Section\nGoogle’s People Also Ask (PAA) refers to related questions searchers may have about your particular topic.\nThe PAA section of Google’s SERPs is a prominent feature that gives publishers an opportunity to bolster their visibility on search engines further.\nOptimizing for the PAA section also helps you bolster your semantic SEO strategy. This is because answering the common questions users ask in relation to your primary keyword helps you create content with semantic depth. It also helps you capture traffic for long-tail keywords.\nYou can check out our guide to\noptimizing for Google’s people also ask section for step-by-step instructions. Here’s a case study of how a food blog optimized its content for the PAA section and grew traffic by 508% in 3 months.\n8. Build Strategic Links\nAnother popular SEO growth hack is link building. However, for it to be impactful, you must do it right. The 3 types of links you should focus on are:\nInternal links\nThese are links between pages on your website. They have many SEO benefits, including distributing link juice across your pages, improving crawling and indexing, enhancing user experience, and more.\nBuilding\nstrategic internal links is a breeze with AIOSEO’s Link Assistant. You don’t have to manually add them. Link Assistant is an AI-powered tool that crawls your site and gives a report of all the links on your site.\nIt also gives you a Links Report that shows you internal linking suggestions and the\norphan pages on your site.\nThe report also shows you all the internal links to and from a post, affiliate links on a post, and all external links.
