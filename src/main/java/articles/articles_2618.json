    "text": "Colombia completó pagos para la COP16 y evita el destino de los Panamericanos La ministra de Medio Ambiente indicó que también se avanza en la agenda del evento de biodiversidad. Ante la incertidumbre sobre la posibilidad de que la COP16 corriera la misma suerte que los Juegos Panamericanos, cuya realización fracasó, la ministra de Medio Ambiente, Susana Muhamad, anunció que Colombia ya completó el pago de todas sus obligaciones financieras para ser sede del evento de biodiversidad más importante del mundo, que se celebrará en octubre en Cali. En cuanto a los preparativos y la agenda, que también han sido una preocupación de distintos sectores, Muhamad señaló que el proceso avanza significativamente, con especial atención en la zona verde y el pabellón Colombia. Puede leer: “Se recibieron al 5 de julio que se cerraron las inscripciones, 1.435 propuestas de eventos de la sociedad civil, del empresariado, de las comunidades de entidades gubernamentales, propuestas de 32 países y una propuesta de 740 iniciativas empresariales para el área de exposición”, indicó la ministra. Subrayó que todo se está sometiendo a curaduría y se ha articulado con el Convenio de Diversidad Biológica, que todavía mantiene abierta la propuesta de agenda para la zona azul, la cual se cerrará el 31 de julio. “Obviamente estamos trabajando contrarreloj, ustedes saben que asumimos una responsabilidad de preparar en siete meses algo que normalmente se prepara en dos años. Entonces es una agenda muy intensa, pero los equipos han respondido muy bien y estamos a tiempo”, agregó. Por su parte el alcalde de Cali, Alejandro Éder, destacó el esfuerzo del sector hotelero para recibir a los más de 19.000 visitantes esperados. Además, destacó el esfuerzo del Ministerio de Defensa por reforzar la seguridad de la ciudad con 4.000 policías adicionales que se sumarán a los 6.000 ya existentes, así como la llegada de 1.600 militares. Entretanto la gobernadora del Valle del Cauca, Dilian Francisca Toro, indicó que se ha organizado una agenda cultural en colaboración con el Ministerio de Cultura, que incluirá actividades en las bibliotecas, Bellas Artes y el Boulevard del Oriente. También se llevará a cabo un foro de gobernadores de Colombia y otros países para discutir iniciativas regionales en biodiversidad. El Ministerio de Comercio, Industria y Turismo ha asegurado que proporcionará apoyo financiero para la adecuación del Centro de Eventos Valle del Pacífico, que será el principal recinto del evento.",

    "text": "He understood warfare and fought spiritual enemies.\nHe dealt with Goliath;\nHe dealt with the Philistines;\nHe subjected all his enemies to shame;\nHe never lost battles;\nHe was the one who eventually captured Jerusalem when the people there were boasting that even if the lame and blind guide the city, it cannot be taken.\nHe entered through their waterways and captured the city. It is therefore spiritually beneficial to learn from his prayers to pick lessons.\nIt is time for you to begin to pray the aggressive prayer of the psalmist.\nWhen situations get to a level and they are mocking you, they are telling you to forsake Christ, they are telling you that you are useless, your mockers are more than your helpers, and it is calling for the aggressive prayer of the psalmist.\nThe coven that can withstand the aggressive prayer of the psalmist has not yet been created.\nI remember that our father in the Lord who has gone to be with the Lord now. He died at age 107.\nI went with him somewhere. They served us jollof-rice and fish. He said, Let us pray on the food, and we bowed our heads.\nHe read the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth psalms, and he was reading them in Yoruba on the food.\nThe food ran cold. Eventually, he finished the prayer. I could not eat. I was full of questions.\nI asked,_ Daddy, why did you have to read so many psalms before we could eat?”\nHe looked at me and said in Yoruba, you are a kid.”\nHe said that he came from a highly polygamous homes with plenty of wives. He said all the wives, including his own mother, were witches.\nAnd those were the people cooking their food. He was eating that food until he started primary 1 at the age of 17.\nHe said, “Young man, I will be praying n my food. That is the food that brought me to this level.\nHe knew the weapons. If not, his life would have been worse. Eventually, he went through school and became a man of God.\nThis is a very serious matter.\nBut the Christians of today are very lazy.\nThe great Apostle Babalola memorised all the psalms in his head, and that is where he used to take weapons from.\nWe are going to stop here today. We will continue this topic next time.\nPRAYER POINTS.\n1. Serpents and scorpions biting my destiny, die in the name of Jesus;\n2. Thunder of God arises; destroy the enemies of my next level, in the name of Jesus;\n3. Stubborn pursuers hear the word of the Lord, pursue yourselves in the name of Jesus.\nGod bless you and your family, in Jesus name, amen.",

This program, inspired by the successful Comprehensive Care Program for the Sick Doctor (PAIME), aims to promote the health and well-being of nurses.\nThe main objective of this protocol is to provide nursing professionals with the support they need in terms of health promotion, prevention, and care. The program will offer voluntary access and rehabilitation for nurses facing health issues, such as mental health or addiction problems. It will also ensure that healthcare workers undergoing treatment receive the necessary care with confidentiality and professional secrecy.\nThe presidents of the General Councils of Medicine and Nursing, Tomás Cobo Castro and Florentino Pérez Raya, praised the initiative, highlighting the importance of ensuring that healthcare professionals are able to provide the best possible care to their patients.\nTomás Cobo emphasized the significance of sharing their experience with other health professions, while Florentino Pérez Raya stressed the importance of supporting nurses who may be struggling with mental health issues and care overload. The program represents a significant improvement in the healthcare system’s ability to care for those who care for others.\nThis collaboration between the General Council of Physicians and the General Nursing Council signifies a positive step towards ensuring that nurses receive the support they need to carry out their vital work effectively.",

    "title": "12 hours after his arrest.. France deports a Tunisian imam for speaking about flags - Teller Report",
    "text": "Mahjoub Mahjoubi was quickly deported from France based on the new immigration law (social networking sites) Yesterday, Thursday, France deported Tunisian imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi, who works in a mosque in the south of the country, on charges of “extremism, promoting hatred in his sermons, and making unacceptable statements,” less than 12 hours after his arrest. For several days, Mahjoubi has been subjected to criticism by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who last Sunday requested the withdrawal of his residence permit. He also asked the governor to inform the judiciary of the statements made by the imam of the mosque in the city of Banyuls-sur-Seize, bringing the matter to an announcement by the public prosecutor in the city of Nimes. It opened a preliminary investigation into the case. Mahjoubi was arrested in front of his family yesterday afternoon based on the deportation decision, according to his lawyer, Samir Hamroun, and was transferred to an administrative detention center in the Paris region. Mahjoubi has lived in France since the mid-eighties, and is married with four children. Darmanin announced - on the X platform - that “less than 12 hours after his arrest,” the French authorities deported him to Tunisia, adding that due to the recently passed immigration law, what he described as the “rapid expulsion” of the imam was possible. 🔴France 🔻The Minister of the Interior of #France today orders the expulsion of the Tunisian Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi. Imam of the city of Pagnol-sur-Seiz. This was only hours after it was reported by a far-right parliamentarian. 🔻The charge is hatred for France 🔻The crime tool. Watch the clip 👇#Boycott_French_products1210@drassagheer pic.twitter.com/Vxo7Txcvpv - Redouan-Radwan (@Redouan224) February 19, 2024 Statements about notables Actions were taken against Mahjoubi against the backdrop of a video clip in which he appeared describing the “tricolor flag” as “a satanic flag that has no value in the sight of God,” in what Darmanin interpreted as a talk about the French flag. However, Mahjoubi confirmed that he was not talking about the French flag, and that he was referring to the multiple flags that were raised in the African Cup of Nations and divided Muslims, and he said, “I am not Voltaire or Victor Hugo, so instead of saying all these multi-colored or different flags, I said all \"These flags are tricolor, but I wasn't talking about France.\" His lawyer echoed this justification, stressing that he was talking about flags in the plural, criticizing nationalism, and promising that no one would believe his client. Because \"he has a beard and an accent.\" For his part, the governor said that the imam has been under surveillance for several months, and the deportation decision was not based on statements from the media alone; Rather, it is linked to others related to the status of women and the Jewish people, as he put it. Deportation of foreign imams Mahjoubi is not the first imam to be deported by France. Abdel Rahim Sayah was previously deported on charges of promoting terrorist acts, and Sayah is an Algerian who was an official in a mosque in France that was closed in 2018. The authorities consider him a “Salafist leader” and he was deported to Algeria last June. At the beginning of 2020, French President Emmanuel Macron announced his intention to end the duties of about 300 imams sent by various countries, while at the same time increasing the number of imams trained in France. Since January 1, France has no longer accepted the appointment of new foreign imams sent by other countries. Source: Agencies",

He described the communication with Eurostar as ‘appalling’.\n‘I think the way (Eurostar) dealt with it is pretty appalling in terms of not trying to say ‘this is how you rebook it, we’ll help you out with expenses’,’ Mr Gibbs told the PA news agency.\n‘They just said, ‘unfortunately, it’s cancelled, we’re sorry, get on with it’, which is shocking really.’\nOrganisers of Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland took the ‘very difficult decision’ to rip up its plans for New Year’s Eve tonight because of the expected stormy winds.\n‘As much as we are very disappointed and frustrated, your safety comes first, as well as ours, and we can’t possibly take the risk,’ they said as they confirmed those who had bought tickets will be fully refunded.\nElsewhere, Barnstaple, in Devon, cancelled its annual fireworks because of the ‘horrendous’ weather, reported Devon Live.\nBarnstaple Town Centre Management said it axed the display for safety reasons.\nThey said: ‘Unfortunately due to the weather conditions and the gusting winds we will be unable to do the fireworks this evening due to safety.\n‘We know this is disappointing, but safety is always the priority and we unfortunately can’t control the weather.’\nTemperatures are set to plummet on New Year’s Day and in January increasing the chance of sleet and snow on higher grounds in the north, with frosty mornings for many.\nWeather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: ‘There are growing signs of cold weather developing as we head through the first half of January.\n‘The chance of a significant cold spell is quite high.\n‘The highest risk of snow will probably be in the North and East. But if low pressure pushes up from the southwest, this would lead to the possibility of snow as weather fronts move northeast.’",

    "text": "Victor Davis Hanson spoke with Laura Ingraham on Fox News about the response of the media to Donald Trump’s success in the Iowa caucus. The Democrat Progressives think that if they keep dehumanizing and lying about Donald Trump, they will destroy him. Ingraham asked Hanson about it.\n“In the last year or two,” Victor Davis Hanson said, “the opposite is true. The more they lie, and they do not apologize, and they do not correct the record, and the more they’re found out, the less credibility they have and the more popularity Donald Trump had in the primaries.\nBut Biden has so much energy:\nTHEY CAN’T STOP THEMSELVES\n“I think that’s going to extend to the general election because they can’t stop,” Hanson continued. “They have a Trump fix. They’re like an addict, and they know it’s not helping them, but they can’t stop it because they’re addicted to it.\n“So they’re going to continue what you saw last night all through the next year, and I think what little credibility they have left will be shot, and it’s going to help Donald Trump. You know, I think we forget that without these media people, the whole January 6 armed insurrection or most of the lies about the origins of COVID and social distancing and masking or the circumstances of George Floyd’s death and the rioting that happened, not to mention disinformation on the laptop or Russian collusion, all of that wouldn’t have had any resonance … it didn’t destroy Donald Trump.\n“He’s got the most amazing political comeback in American political history, and I think that’s because of the news media’s bias.\nLaura Ingraham said, “I don’t know who they think is voting. I mean these are real Americans who are really supporting Trump. So I guess it just confirms what everyone thinks – that these people literally hate, despise the caucus voters in Iowa, they despise them because they’re racist, they’re too white, they’re this or that, they hate them.\n-\nThe Importance of Prayer: How a Christian Gold Company Stands Out by Defending Americans’ Retirement\nDEMOCRATS HATE YOU\nHanson replied, “They do. We drowned them out for a long time. I mean, look at the vocabulary they’ve used: clingers from Obama, and then chumps and dregs from Biden, deplorables, irredeemable, and lately, people like Chris Matthews have been warning us about the dangerous rural people.\n“So they’ve always despised them. … now they have a new narrative that Trump is a dictator. He’s going to have revenge retribution that shows that they’re really scared that nobody’s listening to their lies anymore, and they’re afraid that it’s counterproductive, and now all they can say is Trump might get elected, and he might do this and this. He might do what we would do if we were in his position and had suffered from us. So it’s a projection; it reflects weakness, not strength.\n“I don’t think they have much credibility, and they’re losing the independents, losing minority voters …”\nHopefully, Democrat Progressives will keep acting like loons, showing everyone who they are. All the hate comes from them all of it.\nThe Democrat Progressives think that if they keep dehumanizing and lying about Donald Trump, they will destroy him.",

    "title": "The Indwelling Christ Is The Essence Of Resurrection Power – Pastor Adubofourh Asiedu",
    "text": "The Yennyawoso District Minister of The Church of Pentecost, Pastor Maxwell Adubofourh Asiedu, has stated that the resurrection power is not just an abstract concept, but a living presence within believers, personified in Christ Jesus. In a message shared with the congregation at the ongoing New Tafo Zone Easter Convention at the New Tafo M/A Division School Park on Thursday, March 28, 2024, Pastor Adubofourh Asiedu spoke on the topic: “Experiencing the Pentecostal Power Through the Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.” The convention is being held under the theme: “Jesus Christ, The Resurrection and Life,” – John 11:25. Focusing on John 11:25, Romans 8:11 and Acts 2:36 as his main biblical references, the Yennyawoso District Minister highlighted the significance of Jesus’ death and resurrection, emphasising the immense power that believers inherit through their faith in Him. He encouraged the congregants to recognise and utilize this power, reminding them that they have the ability to bring life to dead situations through their faith in Christ. “When you speak life into a dead situation it must live again because of the resurrection power that is in you,” he said. Drawing from Ephesians 1:17-20 and Philippians 3:9-10, the clergyman noted that the resurrection power is an active manifestation of the move of the Holy Spirit. He explained that Christians have access to this power through their belief in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:16-17), their unity with God (John 10:30), and their role as good servants of God (Matthew 25:14ff). He stressed the importance of obedience, fulfilling the Great Commission, and maintaining a humble and servile attitude to nurture and activate the resurrection power within them, cautioning against self-gratification and self-glorification, as these could hinder the operation of the resurrection power. Emphasising the enduring and transformative nature of the resurrection power, Pastor Adubofourh Asiedu called on non-believers to come to Jesus and experience this power for themselves. The event concluded with a prayer, during which 10 individuals received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and several others received spiritual gifts.
