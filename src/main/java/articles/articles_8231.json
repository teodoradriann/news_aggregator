    "text": "Subscribe to listen May 10, 2024 Several flights to and from Dubai International Airport were canceled May 2 as heavy rains and thunderstorms returned. Distance learning and work from home were advised in preparation for unstable weather across the United Arab Emirates.\nThis weather was less severe than the storm that hit the Gulf country last month. On April 16, a day after Dubai's major airport was named the world’s busiest international airport for the 10th consecutive year, the facility and its flooded runways became the face of the United Arab Emirates' worst rainfall on record.\nMore than 142 millimeters (5.6 inches) of rain fell in Dubai over a 24-hour period, paralyzing the Gulf’s business hub and leaving a wide swath of damage. In the days that followed, the UAE allocated $544 million to compensate Emiratis. Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum said the country has “ learned great lessons in dealing with severe rains .”\nThe flooding, described as “a historic weather event” by the UAE news agency WAM, was a wake-up call for Gulf countries to revisit their exposure to climate risks. According to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global temperatures over land stood in 2011–2020 at 1.59°C above pre-industrial levels, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The increase is causing heat waves in the Arabian Peninsula, shifting rainfall patterns, dust storms and tropical cyclones. The research network World Weather Attribution estimated that climate change made the Gulf deluge 10%-40% more intense than it would have been in the pre-industrial era.\nAccess the Middle East news and analysis you can trust Join our community of Middle East readers to experience all of Al-Monitor, including 24/7 news, analyses, memos, reports and newsletters.\nSubscribe Only $100 per year.\n ",

    "text": "Environmental groups say the EU executive's renewal decision runs contrary to the latest scientific evidence.\nAdvertisement\nA consortium of six NGOs is challenging the European Commission's ten-year extension of the approval of glyphosate, a spokesperson for Pesticide Action Network (PAN) Europe said during a press conference in Brussels today (January), claiming they That this decision fails to comply with EU law. 25).\nPan Europe, ClientEarth EU, Generation Futures, Global 2000, Pan Germany and Pan Netherlands presented their case to the EU Executive on 24 January, citing a number of recent scientific studies that “were ignored during the European Union”. [glyphosate] Approval process”, the spokesperson said.\nThe group claims these studies have shown that the notorious herbicide increases the risk of cancer and insect mortality, and has significant effects on brain and gene function.\nLast November, the Commission renewed its approval of glyphosate use based on safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). However, both EU agencies are equally blamed by NGOs for “not paying enough attention to science”.\nIn the case of EFSA, the agency omitted data on the toxicity of glyphosate to insects in its peer review – which, the group claims, industry data shows causes 100% mortality in some cases, the NGO said. Was accused.\nAccording to a statement from Pan Europe, “The Commission has acted against EU law on pesticide approvals and the precautionary principle by re-approving glyphosate despite evidence that the substance harms humans, animals and the environment.” Could.”\nNGOs claimed that the EU assessment “systematically dismisses non-industry studies”, particularly from academics, whom the group said often compare the toxicity of pesticides to industry studies. But let's give more information.\nAccording to NGOs, studies assessing cancer risk and how glyphosate might affect human organs were also rejected.\nDespite a legal obligation to use the latest and reliable science, the consortium has accused the industry on several occasions of omitting key studies, with EU authorities turning a blind eye, preventing accurate and science-based assessment of pesticides' effectiveness. Compromise is being done properly.\nAngelique Lissimachou, head of science and policy at Pan Europe, pointed out that autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, microbiome and gut-brain effects are some of the key shortcomings that have been observed in the public scientific literature and ignored by the EU . Press conference.\n“The re-authorization of glyphosate for 10 years by the European Commission, in collusion with France and other Member States, is a humanitarian, environmental and democratic disaster,” said MEP Manon Aubry (France/The Left). Advocated for and ignored countless evidence of severe poisoning.”\n“This ignores the opposition expressed by 70% of Europeans against European laws on glyphosate and hazardous substances,” Aubry said.\nStefan de Keersmaeker, the European Commission's spokesperson for the European Green Deal and public health and food safety, said the decision was based on “strong science and evidence” from ECHA and EFSA, and added that the EU executive “will respond” to the NGOs. ' The legal challenge followed a “thorough analysis of the claims”.",

    "text": "Grizzlies Allow One Hit, But Lose at Lake Erie\nAugust 29, 2024 -\nFrontier League (FL) Gateway Grizzlies News Release\nAvon, Ohio - The Gateway Grizzlies did not allow the Lake Erie Crushers a single hit until there were two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning on Thursday night, but the one hit they did allow was a go-ahead, two-run triple by Vincent Byrd, Jr. in a 4-2 loss at Crushers Stadium.\nIt was a combined effort by the Grizzlies' staff, as Deylen Miley struck out four in his three innings pitched to end 2024 with 161 on the year, the second-most in a single season by an individual pitcher in Frontier League history. Kaleb Hill would toss the next three innings, and Justin Goossen-Brown retired the side in the seventh.\nThe game itself was back-and-forth again, as Lake Erie took a 1-0 lead with an unearned run on an RBI groundout by Jake Guenther in the second inning before Gateway responded on a two-out RBI single by Victor Castillo in the top of the third. The Grizzlies then went ahead 2-1 in the next inning on another two-out RBI hit by Tate Wargo, but two leadoff walks by Hill in the bottom half led to a Guenther sac fly, tying the game again.\nIt remained 2-2 until the eighth inning, and after the Grizzlies had runners at first and third base with one out, as well as the bases loaded with two outs but failing to score in the top of the eighth, Keegan Collett (0-1) came in for the bottom half, and retired the first two batters he faced. But Alberti Chavez would reach on an error by Abdiel Diaz and Scout Knotts would follow with a walk, bringing up Byrd, who fell behind 0-2 before hitting a fly ball to left-center field that Castillo nearly caught for the final out of the frame. But it dropped out of his glove for the Crushers' first (and, as it turned out) only hit of the game, scoring the go-ahead runs and making the score 4-2.\nThe Grizzlies would get a runner on base in the ninth inning on an error, bringing the tying run to the plate, but would not be able to score in suffering just their second series loss since the end of June. They will look to bounce back this weekend in the final series of the regular season at home against the Florence Y'alls at Grizzlies Ballpark. First pitch of the series opener is set for tomorrow, August 30, at 6:30 p.m. CT in Sauget.\nGateway Grizzlies Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nFrontier League message board...\nFrontier League Stories from August 29, 2024\nThunderBolts Drop Series to Washington- Windy City ThunderBolts Boomers Survive a Nail-Biter in Home Finale- Schaumburg Boomers Byrd Rumbles to Third, Gives Crushers Late Win to Keep Pace in the West- Lake Erie Crushers Grizzlies Allow One Hit, But Lose at Lake Erie- Gateway Grizzlies Washer's Two Homers, Great Pitching Cap Regular Season Road Schedule- Washington Wild Things ValleyCats Inch Closer to Playoff Berth with Shutout Victory- Tri-City ValleyCats Y'alls Lulled to Sleep in Final Home Game- Florence Y'alls Jandron Tosses Quality Outing, Bats Fall Silent Again- Ottawa Titans Grizzlies Set for \"Greatest Night in Baseball\"- Gateway Grizzlies Tickets for ValleyCats \"Playoff Game A\" on Sale Now- Tri-City ValleyCats FL Recap- FL ThunderBolts Lose Late Lead, Fall to Washington- Windy City ThunderBolts Cristino's Multi-Hit Game Falls Short, Knockouts Drop Middle Bill- New England Knockouts Otters Can't Hold on in Game Two- Evansville Otters ValleyCats Bash Four Homers in Win Over Jackals- Tri-City ValleyCats Walk-off Keeps Boomers in Playoff Position- Schaumburg Boomers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

Nelle prove libere 1 Verstappen davanti a Leclerc LA RICERCA Aci-Censis, Gp Monza vale 142 milioni di euro. Imola 85. Ricadute su sistema produttivo italiano per 80 milioni FORMULA 1 Monza, Antonelli a 18 anni debutta con la Mercedes a fianco del futuro ferrarista Hamilton PER MARCA FORMULA 1 Kimi Antonelli, incidente al debutto (dopo 3 giri) con la Mercedes a Monza. Nelle prove libere 1 Verstappen davanti a Leclerc ENDURANCE WEC: il BoP penalizza Toyota e Porsche ad Austin, Ferrari e Lamborghini alleggerite FORMULA 1 McLaren imita Red Bull, è Norris il nuovo cannibale. Ferrari dà segnali di guerra in vista di Monza\nC'era tanta attesa, forse anche troppa, per la prima volta di Andrea Kimi Antonelli nella FP1 di Monza con la Mercedes. Il giovane bolognese , che nelle prossime ore dovrebbe essere annunciato come pilota del team diretto da Toto Wolff al fianco di George Russell per la stagione 2025, è entrato in pista tenendo subito un ritmo elevato, utilizzando anche gomme soft. Ma dopo appena tre giri cronometrati, cinque in totale, all'ingresso della Parabolica forse affrontata con troppa velocità, ha perso il posteriore della sua W15, si è girato, e con una certa violenza ha sbattuto contro le protezioni.\nMonza, Antonelli a 18 anni debutta con la Mercedes a fianco del futuro ferrarista Hamilton\n Non certo una bella figura e non ricordiamo un pilota al debutto nella FP1 finire subito fuori pista. Ma tant'è, è andata male, può accadere e Antonelli avrà altre occasioni e non sarà certo questo incidente a segnare il suo futuro. Intanto, proseguirà a lavorare nei test privati con la Mercedes 2022, 25 i giorni di test programmati per lui, di questi ne ha già svolti parecchi. Preoccupato, invece, George Russell, quasi sbiancato nel vedere la sua monoposto, ceduta per l'occasione ad Antonelli, pesantemente danneggiata alla Parabolica.\nNot the FP1 outing that Kimi Antonelli was looking for 😔 #F1 #ItalianGP pic.twitter.com/KmEHF8Ewv8\n— Formula 1 (@F1) August 30, 2024 Con l'asfalto bello fresco e i cordoli bassi che richiedono maggiore aggressività, i piloti hanno preso confidenza con queste novità e alla fine della sessione, dopo la bandiera rossa per l'incidente di Antonelli, è emerso Max Verstappen con la Red Bull-Honda in 1'21\"676. Una bella risposta del team diretto da Christian Horner, anche se siamo soltanto all'inizio di un lungo weekend, rispetto alla perdita di quella competitività che aveva caratterizzato l'inizio di stagione e le due precedenti stagioni.\nGp Monza, l' “Anello della Regina” per chi farà la pole. Gioiello in oro con bandiera a scacchi e il tricolore italiano\nVerstappen ha preceduto di 228 millesimi Charles Leclerc con una Ferrari che presenta alcune novità al fondo e per il monegasco un motore nuovo. Carlos Sainz aveva battezzato una nuova power unit a Zandvoort. Lo spagnolo stamane ha colto il quarto tempo. Tra le due Ferrari, si è inserita la temutissima McLaren-Mercedes di Lando Norris mentre Oscar Piastri ha concluso sesto. Notevole la prestazione della Sauber-Ferrari, quinta con Valtteri Bottas.\nLewis Hamilton è risultato settimo con la Mercedes, bene la Williams-Mercedes, ottava con Alexander Albon. Una buona sessione l'ha fatta il debuttante assoluto Franco Colapinto che in Williams ha preso il posto di Logan Sargeant. L'argentino, che arriva dalla Formula 2 dove occupava il sesto posto, è risultato 17esimo prendendo confidenza con la monoposto, che aveva saggiato nella FP1 di Silverstone, senza commettere errori.\nA completare la top 10, Sergio Perez, con la seconda Red Bull e lontano dal compagno di squadra, e Fernando Alonso con la Aston Martin-Mercedes. Buon avvio per la Haas-Ferrari, che ha differenziato il lavoro tra Kevin Magnussen, 11esimo, e Nico Hulkenberg, 19esimo. Bene anche Daniel Ricciardo, 12esimo con la Racing Bulls-Honda, di poco davanti al compagno Yuki Tsunoda.\nVenerdì 30 agosto 2024, libere 1\n1 - Max Verstappen (Red Bull-Honda) - 1'21\"676 - 19 giri\n2 - Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) - 1'21\"904 - 23\n3 - Lando Norris (McLaren-Mercedes) - 1'21\"917 - 26\n4 - Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) - 1'22\"126 - 24\n5 - Valtteri Bottas (Sauber-Ferrari) - 1'22\"127 - 21\n6 - Oscar Piastri (McLaren-Mercedes) - 1'22\"199 - 23\n7 - Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 1'22\"214 - 24\n8 - Alexander Albon (Williams-Mercedes) - 1'22\"220 - 24\n9 - Sergio Perez (Red Bull-Honda) - 1'22\"311 - 21\n10 - Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin-Mercedes) - 1'22\"315 - 18\n11 - Kevin Magnussen (Haas-Ferrari) - 1'22\"572 - 22\n12 - Daniel Ricciardo (Racing Bulls-Honda) - 1'22\"605 - 21\n13 - Yuki Tsunoda (Racing Bulls-Honda) - 1'22\"714 - 23\n14 - Pierre Gasly (Alpine-Renault) - 1'22\"763 - 22\n15 - Guan Yu Zhou (Sauber-Ferrari) - 1'22\"854 - 22\n16 - Lance Stroll (Aston Martin-Mercedes) - 1'22\"864 - 21\n17 - Franco Colapinto (Williams-Mercedes) - 1'22\"880 - 23\n18 - Esteban Ocon (Alpine-Renault) - 1'22\"880 - 21\n19 - Nico Hulkenberg (Haas-Ferrari) - 1'23\"157 - 23\n20 - Andrea Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes) - 1'23\"955 - 5",
