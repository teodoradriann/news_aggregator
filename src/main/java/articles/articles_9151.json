NBA Labs spotted him on the internet and wanted his help reusing portable basketball court flooring used in a 2011 All-Star game played in Los Angeles.\n“Once that flooring is installed three or four times, it’s not thick enough for games,” Corl noted.\nCorl’s current assignment requires cutting up the court flooring used by the NBA in the 2024 All-Star game, played in Indianapolis, into approximately 50,000 2-inch-square sections.\n“They are going to be individually boxed and sold in Walmart, hopefully by February 2025,” he said.\nOne of Corl’s biggest challenges is finding help with the woodworking.\n“When I was in the middle of Ohio, I was near the biggest Amish community in the United States, and I had plenty of workers,” Corl said, although he has been able to get help from a neighboring couple down the road, for which he is very grateful. “But I’ve pretty much been working seven days a week since July to get this work done.”\nThe 65-year-old woodworker described one of his early NBA wood court projects: cutting thousands of pieces of purple and gold laminated sections of the flooring for an artist who used computer pixilation technology to make a 12-by-12-foot wooden mosaic portrait of Laker great Shaquille O’Neal.\n“We hung it up in Las Vegas on a huge easel I built. It was amazing,” said Corl, who also used his precision equipment to shave thick sheets of NBA flooring into ultra thin wood veneers for cigar humidors and mobile phone cases.\nNew to the area, Corl and his wife, Susan, a weaver, accepted internships in 2023 as resident stewards at the Good Life Center near Harborside, the abode of the late back-to-the-land advocates Scott and Helen Nearing.\nAfter a spring, summer and early fall tending gardens and looking out onto Orr Cove, the Corls decided to relocate from Ohio. The couple now rents a house just down the road from the old Grange Hall on Cape Rosier Road. The town of Brooksville agreed to rent him shop space for three months in a nearby town garage that also houses a mid-20th century fire truck, sharing space as the NBA project marches toward completion.\nThis story appears through a media partnership with the Penobscot Bay Press.\nMore articles from the BDN",

    "text": "L'enseigne de bricolage prévoit une rupture conventionnelle qui pourra concerner jusqu'à 100 salariés de son siège près de Lille alors que son concurrent a aussi récemment réduit ses effectifs dans ses fonctions centrales. L'enseigne de bricolage Castorama prévoit une rupture conventionnelle qui pourra concerner jusqu'à 100 salariés de son siège, près de Lille, soit un sur sept, alors que son concurrent Leroy Merlin a aussi récemment réduit ses effectifs dans ses fonctions centrales.\n\"La rupture conventionnelle collective s'applique uniquement aux salariés volontaires du siège de l'enseigne. Aucun collaborateur des magasins n'est concerné\", a précisé Castorama dans un communiqué reçu vendredi. Ce dispositif s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un plan stratégique de Castorama lancé en mars, qui a pour objectif de redresser sa rentabilité et l'aider à rester compétitif \"dans un contexte concurrentiel en constante évolution\", a ajouté l'entreprise.\nEnseigne du groupe britannique Kingfisher, Castorama compte au total plus de 11.000 collaborateurs et 95 magasins en France. Après avoir connu un boom du bricolage durant la pandémie de Covid-19 , le secteur déchante en France. Au troisième trimestre, les ventes de Castorama ont reculé de 4,9% sur un an, selon les derniers résultats de Kingfisher publiés lundi. Le groupe britannique, également propriétaire de Brico Dépôt (dont les ventes ont décliné de 3,3% sur la même période), a mis ces mauvais chiffres sur le compte de \"la faiblesse du moral des consommateurs et de conditions météorologiques défavorables\".\nDépart de 130 collaborateurs chez Leroy Merlin Grand rival de Castorama, Leroy Merlin a aussi procédé à une rupture conventionnelle collective ces derniers mois dans son siège de Lezennes, dans la banlieue lilloise, entraînant le départ de 130 collaborateurs, a indiqué l'enseigne vendredi, confirmant des informations des Echos . Le chiffre d'affaires de Leroy Merlin \"enregistre un recul à l'image du marché\", a ajouté une porte-parole, sans détailler davantage.\n\"En cause essentiellement, la baisse des transactions immobilières et des naissances\", qui amoindrit les travaux effectués par les Français, a-t-elle expliqué. Comptant environ 30.000 collaborateurs et 144 magasins en France selon son site, Leroy Merlin appartient à la galaxie Mulliez, également propriétaire du distributeur Auchan, lequel a annoncé début novembre un plan social massif menaçant 2.389 emplois en France .\nTT avec AFP Les plus lus\n\"C'est sublime\": les premières images de l'intérieur de Notre-Dame de Paris",

    "text": "Wednesday was the official reveal of the Switch 2. Nintendo revealed that its next console will come out on June 5 and have a starting price of $450. In its hour-long Nintendo Direct, a lot of games were shown and I can safely say I'm excited.\nThe Switch 2 looks like it's going to have a lot of support from third-party developers to go along with Nintendo's spectacular first-party games. This means the new Switch will hit the ground running as its launch lineup already looks good, but there's going to be even more must-buy games after its launch.\nThese are a few of the games I'm most excited about:\nThe Duskbloods\nArguably, the biggest surprise of Wednesday's show was The Duskbloods from popular developer FromSoftware. The studio behind Dark Souls and Elden Ring is making an exclusive game for the Switch 2, and it looks remarkably like its last exclusive game, Bloodborne. There are still many questions about the game, but this is easily going to be the most anticipated game for 2026.\nHollow Knight: Silksong\nHollow Knight from developer Team Cherry was a cult hit when it came out in 2017. Back in 2019, the developer revealed it was doing a sequel called Hollow Knight: Silksong that would focus on Hornet, a rival turned ally of the Knight who was the hero of the first game. Only a few seconds were shown during the stream, but this clip excited fans as it was confirmation that the game exists after years of silence from the developer.\nMario Kart World\nIf there's one franchise that is a must-buy, it would be Mario Kart. With the new game, Mario Kart World, the kart racing game goes to an open-world game, letting players travel anywhere. The game looks like so much fun, and I'm looking to buy the Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle when the console launches.\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nOne of the franchises I wrote that Nintendo forgot about was Donkey Kong, so I was happy to see it come back on the Switch 2. Donkey Kong Bananza is a new 3D platforming game featuring the Nintendo mascot, and it looks like something brand-new and not just another entry in the Donkey Kong Country franchise. Nintendo did give a release date of July 17 for Donkey Kong's new game, and I can't wait.\nElden Ring Tarnished Edition\nFromSoftware had a double whammy of games during the Switch 2 Direct. Even though this is a port of Elden Ring, the Tarnished Edition includes the original game as well as the DLC, Shadows of the Erdtree.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition\nCyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game and having that playable on a handheld console will be a sight to see. It took multiple patches to get the games to run smoothly on the Steam Deck, but if it can run well right out of the box on the Switch 2, it will be a game to pick up.\nProject 007\nThis was another surprise from the Nintendo Direct stream. IO Interactive is developing the new Bond game, but not much other than the working title has been revealed. Still, with a studio like IO Interactive working on the game, it's easy to be excited for another Bond game.\nHere are some of the other games shown on Wednesday that I'm excited for:\n- Sid Meier's Civilization VII (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Split Fiction\n- Street Fighter 6\n- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Yakuza 0 Director's Cut\n- Shadow Labyrinth (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition\n- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4\n- Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment\n- Marvel Cosmic Invasion\n- Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Borderlands 4\n- Kirby Air Riders\n- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\nThe Switch 2 launches on June 5, and preorders will be available at retailers starting on April 9. To prevent scalpers from buying most of the Switch 2 stock, Nintendo implemented some interesting requirements for those who want to buy a Switch 2 from the company.",

El pronóstico incluye un combo de calor y algunas nubes para este martes . Eso sí, no hay lluvias a la vista al menos hasta el domingo.\nEl tiempo en Rosario: la lluvia copa el sábado y desarma las valijas para el fin de semana La primera jornada hábil del año empezó bajo un cielo prácticamente despejado, mientras que la marca del termómetro superó los 19 grados y el viento soplaba desde el sur. A primera hora, la Municipalidad reportó circulación normal en los accesos a la ciudad, aunque cabe recordar que esta semana se esperan cortes de tránsito en el microcentro por la reparación de calle Santa Fe.\n¿Cómo estará el tiempo en Rosario el martes 2 de enero? El informe del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) deja bastante margen para cualquier actividad al aire libre durante la mañana. El escenario es diferente a partir del mediodía de este martes, ya que se espera un aumento de temperatura significativo en Rosario .\nEl pronóstico para la jornada incluye una máxima de 31 ° a nivel local . Así se abre la puerta a una tarde calurosa y con el cielo parcialmente nublado. Por otra parte, el viento del este promete cierto alivio durante la noche.\nDe acuerdo a los datos del SMN, el resto de la semana transcurrirá sin lluvias en Rosario . Desde el miércoles se vienen mañanas un poco menos frescas, ya que las mínimas tienden a subir ligeramente. Finalmente, recién el domingo es posible que se produzcan tormentas aisladas por la madrugada.",

    "text": "WISCONSIN -- (WAOW) During most winters, snowmobiles cruising through the countryside are a common site. But with now major snowfall until recently, the trails have been bare. Now that some has fallen, area snowmobile clubs say it's a step in the right direction. Allan Zahrt, the vice president of the [Trailmates Snowmobile Club](https://www.trailmatesclub.com/), said, \"We needed cold weather first, to freeze up the streams and rivers and lakes and get the ground frozen properly. So, now we're starting to get the snow on top. We do need a little bit more snow here in Marathon County.\" In the Northwoods, the folks at [American Pond Hockey](https://www.americanpondhockey.com/) are preparing for their annual tournament in a couple of weeks. They said that they're pleased with what Mother Nature has given so far. Will Jeffery, the founder of American Pond Hockey, said, \"What we are focused on, and paying the most attention to, is the timing of the wild lake ice, and when that forms, and when the first heavyweight snow comes after that.\" Jeffery said that this week's single-digit temperatures will make sure that there's plenty of ice to play on come February. Further to the south, where there was more snowfall, some snowmobile clubs are already taking advantage. Several trails across Wood County are opening back up.",

Da lunedì assisteremo all'arrivo della classica 'ottobrata'.\nIl ritorno dell'anticiclone africano\nSulla tutta Italia assisteremo a un aumento della pressione atmosferica e un rialzo termico che si farà sentire soprattutto sulla Sardegna e sulle regioni tirreniche. Le temperature saranno di circa 4-6 gradi Celsius superiori alla media del periodo, con valori più consoni al mese di settembre che a quello di ottobre. La regione più calda della penisola sarà la Sardegna, dove si potranno avere picchi fino a 27-28 °C, e dove le temperature minime saranno comprese tra i 17 e i 20 °C.\nNell'Italia centrale, le massime saranno comprese tra i 21 e i 24 °C, con picchi fino a 25-26 °C sulle zone pianeggianti del Lazio. I valori minimi oscilleranno tra i 14 e i 17 °C. Al Sud Italia e in Sicilia, i valori massimi saranno compresi tra i 23 e i 26 °C, mentre le minime saranno comprese tra i 15 e i 18 °C.\nL'aumento delle temperature sarà più marginale e ben più contenuto al Nord Italia dove le temperature massime saranno comprese tra i 17 e i 21 °C, a seconda delle zone, mentre i valori minimi oscilleranno tra i 12 e i 15 °C.\nNei prossimi giorni non ci saranno fenomeni atmosferici significativi, i cieli saranno sereni o poco nuvolosi.
