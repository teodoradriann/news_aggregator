    "text": "Subscribe to Our Newsletter\nOAKLAND – California Attorney General Rob Bonta today highlighted the California Department of Justice’s (DOJ) efforts to protect and defend the people and resources of California over the past year. In 2023, DOJ worked to improve the lives of Californians by protecting public health and safety and advancing justice for all by enforcing and defending laws touching nearly all facets of life, including healthcare, the environment, housing, consumer protection, civil rights, and criminal justice.\n“At the California Department of Justice, 2023 was a year of accountability: We took bold action to hold polluters, corporate giants, and bad actors accountable, and worked every day to build stronger, safer communities while working proactively to find solutions to some of the largest problems facing Californians, from gun violence to threats to our health and safety,” said Attorney General Bonta. “I’m proud of the nearly 6,000 DOJ employees who work day in and day out on behalf of the people of California, and all that we have accomplished together. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to advance Californians' fundamental rights, work toward environmental and economic justice, hold bad actors accountable, and beyond.”\nKEY ACTIONS\nFENTANYL CRACKDOWN: Joined the FAST task force to address fentanyl trafficking from the U.S. and Mexico border and continued ongoing efforts to remove fentanyl from our streets, through arrests and seizures\nCOMBATTING RETAIL CRIME: Announced a first-of-its-kind agreement between retailers and online marketplaces to address retail crime, and continued ongoing efforts to dismantle retail theft rings\nTACKLING THE HOUSING CRISIS: Made way for the development of thousands of potential additional units of housing by putting local governments on notice for violating state housing laws\nTAKING ON BIG TECH: Filed a lawsuit against Meta to protect youth online\nFIGHTING GUN VIOLENCE: Unveiled the Office of Gun Violence Prevention’s first-ever data report highlighting California’s successes in preventing gun violence, and shining light further areas for improvement\nDEFENDING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: Announced a groundbreaking lawsuit against a national anti-abortion group and a chain of five crisis pregnancy centers for using misleading claims to lure in and deceive pregnant people\nCLIMATE ACTION: Filed a groundbreaking lawsuit against Big Oil for engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception about the climate harms of their products\nPROTECTING CONSUMERS: Sponsored successful legislation to protect Californians’ pocketbooks by banning hidden fees\nSAFEGUARDING PUBLIC HEALTH: Secured $462 million settlement with JUUL for fueling the youth tobacco crisis\nFighting Crime and Supporting Victims and Survivors: Attorney General Bonta worked together with local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to protect California’s public safety by cracking down on theft and illegal narcotics, dismantling organized criminal activity, and holding bad actors accountable. The Attorney General announced major law enforcement operations across the state, from tackling human trafficking in\nSan Mateo County and San Diego, to dismantling criminal organizations in Los Angeles, Stockton, and Fresno. The Attorney General also stepped-up efforts to target sexual predators while protecting victims and survivors in their right to restitution and to see their traffickers held accountable.\nA key focus of 2023 was addressing organized retail crime by bringing charges against an\norganized smash and grab group, charging a group responsible for cargo thefts targeting Microsoft products, and making arrests of an organized retail crime group targeting Apple Stores. Attorney General Bonta went a step further this year by announcing a first-of-its-kind agreement between retailers and online marketplaces to address retail crime.\nAttorney General Bonta made combatting the fentanyl crisis a top priority. Since April 2022, the California DOJ has seized approximately 10,834,302 fentanyl pills, 2,951 pounds of powder, and made over 280 arrests related to fentanyl. In addition, DOJ joined\nthe Fentanyl Abatement and Suppression Team (FAST) to address fentanyl trafficking from the U.S. and Mexico border and the San Francisco task force to address fentanyl trafficking in the Bay Area. The Attorney General provided critical support to Placer County, https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-seizure-more-485000-fentanyl-pills-fresno and Merced County through the Bureau of Investigation to arrest and apprehend fentanyl dealers and seize fentanyl from communities.\nIn 2023, California Attorney General Bonta released the\n2022 Hate Crime in California Report, and amid an alarming rise in hate crimes highlighted resources to combat hate, as well as a new law enforcement bulletin to assist law enforcement in combatting hate crimes. The Attorney General continued to engage with local leaders through hate crime roundtables in Bakersfield, https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-local-leaders-discuss-combating-hate-crimes-and-0, Anaheim and Irvine.\nAttorney General Bonta sent a strong message that those who\ncommit fraud will be caught and pay for their crime. Numerous charges were brought against individuals for embezzlement, tax evasion, and recycling fraud. The Attorney General announced the establishment of the first-ever Post-Conviction Justice Unit, addressed illegal cannabis and promoted the awareness of the missing and murdered indigenous peoples’ crisis.\nTackling California's Housing Crisis: As California continued to face a housing shortage and affordability crisis of epic proportions, Attorney General Bonta’s\nHousing Justice Team ramped up its enforcement of state housing production, consumer protection, and housing discrimination laws, putting local governments from Huntington Beach and Coronado, to San Bernardino and Elk Grove on notice for violations of state housing laws. The Attorney General also worked to enforce obligations under state law, like the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), requiring local governments to plan and zone for more housing.\nAs housing costs continue to overly burden household budgets, Attorney General Bonta fought to protect tenants’ and homeowners’ rights and prevent housing discrimination. Attorney General Bonta\nreminded California tenants of their rights and protections under state law, including limits on rent increases, announced statewide guidance to address Crime-Free Housing policies that disproportionally discriminate against people of color, survivors of domestic violence, people with disabilities, and justice-involved individuals, and brought financial relief to tenants who endured illegal rent increases and evictions by enforcing the Tenant Protection Act against Green Valley Corporation.\nProtecting Reproductive Freedom and the Public Health: This year, Attorney General Bonta continued to fiercely defend and protect the reproductive freedom and liberties of Californians and people across the nation. In September, he\nsued a national anti-abortion group and a chain of five crisis pregnancy centers for using false claims to lure in pregnant patients and mislead them. He announced the results of investigations into anti-implicit bias training for pregnancy care providers, and into reproductive healthcare access in county jails. Emboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion states focused their onslaught on the FDA's decades-old approval of mifepristone, widely used for medication abortion. From joining forces with states across the nation on briefs in the Fifth Circuit appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court, to publicly countering the lies and empty rhetoric of anti-mifepristone forces and reminding Californians of the laws that protect their access to medication abortion and other reproductive care, Attorney General Bonta fought the partisan attacks on mifepristone aggressively on every front and with every tool at his disposal. He also led nationwide fights to push for increased access to birth control coverage, protect Americans’ access to abortions during life-threatening medical emergencies, and support stronger protections for reproductive health data privacy.\nAttorney General Bonta fought for Californians’ rights to affordable, equitable healthcare and protected Californians against threats to the public health. He\nsued the nation's largest insulin makers and pharmacy benefit managers for driving up the cost of the lifesaving drug by leveraging their market power to unlawfully overcharge patients, and as Californians grappled with the ongoing fallout from the opioid epidemic, secured billions of dollars in nationwide settlements with pharmacies CVS and Walgreens and manufacturers Allergan and Teva for their role in the opioid crisis. The settlements are expected to bring in much needed funding to address the needs of California's communities. He also worked to protect the public – particularly youth and vulnerable populations – from harmful and addictive tobacco products by taking legal action against two California online retailers of e-cigarettes over violations of state and federal laws, and by securing a $462 million multistate settlement agreement with electronic cigarette maker, JUUL, Labs, Inc. that prohibits the company from targeting youth in its advertising and promotion.\nTaking on Corporate Polluters and Protecting the Environment: In 2023, the Attorney General took on corporate polluters and fought to protect the health and safety of California communities through innovative settlements and major lawsuits. In September, Attorney General Bonta filed a\nlandmark lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies and a trade association for engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception about the climate harms of their products. He announced a settlement with Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) over misleading, unqualified environmental marketing claims the company made that natural gas is “renewable,” and reached settlements with Kaiser for improper hazardous waste disposal, as well as with several owners and operators of gas stations for violating state environmental laws.\nHe continued his ongoing work to combat the harmful effects of PFAS, calling\nfor 3M and Dupont to pay more for contaminating Americans’ drinking water supply with these toxic forever chemicals, and issuing an enforcement advisory letter to manufacturers, distributors, and sellers of food packaging and cookware, reminding them of their obligations under Assembly Bill 1200, which restricts the presence of PFAS in food packaging and imposes labeling disclosure requirements for cookware, as well as a consumer alert with tips for reducing PFAS exposures.\nRecognizing that certain communities endure a disproportionate share of environmental pollution, Attorney General Bonta’s\nBureau of Environmental Justice sent CEQA letters, reached innovative settlements, and issued guidance to address historic and ongoing inequities in land use decisions and beyond. In September, he announced a settlement with the Port of Oakland and Eagle Rock Aggregates, securing binding commitments to mitigate the Eagle Rock project’s air quality impacts and provide other benefits for West Oakland residents, raised serious legal concerns about the environmental and housing impacts of a proposed warehouse development plan in the Inland Valley, and secured settlements that reduce wildfire ignition and evacuation risks and conserve sensitive ecosystems. He also issued guidance to local governments on promoting environmental justice for marginalized communities across California.\nAddressing Gun Violence: Attorney General Bonta continued his leadership with a strong, statewide effort to put an end to gun violence. He took action to provide crucial data necessary to continue our fight against gun violence by securing a\ncourt decision enabling vital data sharing with gun violence researchers, and releasing two inaugural reports out of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention. The first report focused on gun violence in California highlighted California’s successes in preventing gun violence and shined a light on successful strategies and further areas for improvement. The second report focused on domestic violence and showed that California has made substantial long-term progress in reducing the incidence of domestic violence involving firearms but it increased during the pandemic. It emphasized the importance of Domestic Violence Restraining Orders for survivors’ safety and gun violence prevention.\nThe Attorney General\nworked on the ground to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals, and announced the 2022 APPS report. He supported stronger federal firearm laws and announced the seizure of illegal weapons in Visalia and Los Angeles. Attorney General Bonta also fought to defend California’s gun laws by supporting the large capacity magazine ban, the assault weapons ban, age-based firearm restrictions, the Unsafe Handgun Act, and urging the Supreme Court to uphold protections for survivors of abuse against gun violence. Attorney General Bonta's sponsored legislation, Senate Bill 2, which strengthens California’s concealed carry weapons restrictions was signed into law.\nSafeguarding the Civil Rights of All: Throughout the year, Attorney General Bonta worked tirelessly to protect the civil rights of people in California and across the country. Amidst unprecedented attacks on the LGBTQ+ community across the nation, Attorney General Bonta stood up for the rights of LGBTQ+ people to live, work, and pursue education free from discrimination: from\nfighting forced outing policies in Chino Valley and across the state to challenging bans on inclusive curricula and textbooks in classrooms. Outside of California, the Attorney General stood up against Idaho legislation undermining transgender students’ constitutional rights, and joined multiple amicus briefs in support of gender-affirming care for transgender youth.\nThe Attorney General worked to the safeguard Californians’ civil rights through stipulated judgements with\nKern County addressing free-speech violations, and to reform the Vallejo Police Department’s policies and practices; opened civil rights investigations into the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office and Antioch Police Department; and through the Racial Justice Bureau, supported the work of the Reparations Task Force in issuing its historic final report on the harms of slavery and systemic discrimination of African Americans. He took action to protect workers, launching an historic investigation into gender discrimination in the National Football League, fought for the rights of transportation workers, and immigrant children. He also took action to uphold voter rights by opening an investigation into Butte County’s redistricting process, and standing up in court for disenfranchised persons.\nProtecting Consumers, Preserving Competition and Taking on Bad Corporate Actors: In 2023, Attorney General Bonta fought to protect consumers and build a more fair and competitive economy. The Attorney General aggressively enforced state and federal antitrust laws, joining US DOJ in a lawsuit to\nchallenge the anticompetitive merger of Spirit and JetBlue, continuing his prosecution of Amazon for blocking price competition, and joining a lawsuit against Agri Stats for facilitating meat processors’ unlawful increase on the prices Californians pay for chicken, pork, and turkey.\nIn this digital age, Attorney General Bonta worked aggressively to protect youth and California families online. He co-led a bipartisan coalition of 33 attorneys general in filing a\nlawsuit against Meta for designing and deploying harmful features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children and teens to their mental and physical detriment, and later celebrated the release of a damning unredacted complaint in that case. He also continued his defense of California’s Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a California law requiring companies to prioritize the online privacy, safety, and well-being of children over commercial interests, and filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court defending the right of government entities to engage with social media companies to protect the public.\nAttorney General Bonta also secured settlements and sponsored legislation to protect hardworking California families and their pocketbooks. In 2023, he sponsored successful\n legislation to ban hidden fees as well as legislation to compensate victims of consumer protection violations. He announced a $93 million settlement against Google regarding its location-privacy practices, and a $ 700 million settlement with Google for monopolizing Android App Distribution.\nProtecting California’s Elders and Medi-Cal Program: In 2023, Attorney General Bonta worked to protect the safety and well-being of California's elder and dependent adults by bringing legal action against bad actors who committed\nneglect, abuse and fraud against them. He issued a consumer alert, as well as new guidance for mandated reporters who play a critical role in safeguarding this vulnerable population. Attorney General Bonta also protected the integrity of the state's Medi-Cal program by carrying out investigations, arrests, and prosecutions against medical providers who illegally defrauded Medi-Cal. In August, he announced the arrest of a Santa Clara County doctor for an alleged illegal prescription scheme and secured the sentencing of a Southern California doctor for prescribing medically unnecessary medications. He also secured an over $215 million settlement against a national healthcare company for allegedly falsely reporting higher prescription drug costs; secured a nearly $11.4 million settlement with the owner of one of California’s largest chains of pain management clinics; and announced a $3.8 million settlement against a Riverside nursing facility accused of paying illegal kickbacks to doctors.\nThese ongoing efforts are made possible not only by partners at the federal, state, and local level, but by the hard work and dedication of the thousands of people employed at DOJ. They include lawyers, special agents, researchers, information technology technicians, program analysts, legal secretaries, field representatives, scientists, and more.

    "title": "Tesla Model 3 Australian deliveries confirmed for \"mid 2019\" - PerformanceDrive",
    "text": "Those interested in buying a Tesla Model 3 in Australia, or those awaiting delivery, will be excited to hear the company boss has confirmed a more detailed timeline for right-hand drive production.\nProduction of right-hand drive versions was previously locked in for 2019. However, in a recent Twitter conversion, Elon Musk confirmed that Australian deliveries are scheduled to begin “around mid 2019”. Musk also confirmed a similar timeframe for the UK market.\nThe first Model 3 vehicles delivered outside of USA and Canada are set to begin in parts of Europe from February/March, followed by Asia-Pacific (including Australia). It’s unknown if the Australian timing will include other right-hand drive Asia-Pacific markets, such as New Zealand and Japan. In any case, this will come as very good news to fans and reservation-holders, as many hiccups and parts supply delays had previously put off the expected arrival until 2020.\nMore specific details on what variants would arrive first haven’t been outlined. An entry-level variant has just been launched in the US, called the Mid Range. It features a single electric motor and thus rear-wheel drive, as opposed to the initially-launching Performance model that comes with two motors and all-wheel drive.\nAccording to the Tesla-AU website, it only says production of right-hand drive begins in 2019. The Performance model offers a 0-60mph (97km/h) time of just 3.5 seconds, while the Mid Range two-wheel drive model can cover the sprint in a claimed 5.6 seconds. The range varies from 354km to 500km, according to the website.\nAustralian prices are yet to be confirmed. However, the local website does mention the starting price of US$35,000 before incentives. After a straight currency conversion, this translates to $49,289. However, we’d be suggesting this figure could balloon to around $60,000 by the time local tax and import costs are involved.",

    "text": "EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (Oct. 10, 2024) – Xcel Energy has employees in Florida ready to respond to power outages from Hurricane Milton after finishing power restoration efforts in Georgia following Hurricane Helene.\nOver 100 employees made up of line workers, safety consultants, fleet mechanics and operations leaders from Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas are prepared to respond to power outages in the wake of Milton. Employees are assigned to support Tampa Electric Company and Duke Energy.\nCrews from Eau Claire, Menomonie, Hudson, Amery, Rice Lake, La Crosse, Sparta, Manitowish Waters and Ironwood, Mich. are currently staged in Fort Walton Beach, Florida awaiting assignment in the Tampa area. A total of about 15 line workers are part of the effort.\n“This area of the country has been devasted by hurricane damage and we’re grateful to our crews and everyone who has worked tirelessly to restore power. We saw the importance of mutual aid in the wake of Hurricane Helene and are honored to show up once again.” said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO at Xcel Energy.\n“I am incredibly proud of our crews for their outstanding efforts in restoring essential services in Georgia,” said Karl Hoesly, President of Xcel Energy Wisconsin/Michigan. “They have worked diligently and safely under challenging conditions and are ready to extend their support to those in need in Florida.”\nLast week, the company sent these crews to Georgia where they restored power to roughly 2,000 customers, repaired five miles of power lines, fixed 50 broken poles, replaced 10 transformers and cleared debris from Hurricane Helene.\nXcel Energy is part of the Edison Electric Institute’s Mutual Assistance program. Following major storms that bring significant outages, electric companies use this program—a voluntary partnership of electric companies from across the country—to help speed restoration.

    "text": "Corte Suprema otorgó libertad condicional a Luis Alfredo Ramos por buen comportamiento La alta corte le concedió el beneficio al resolver el recurso de apelación que interpuso la defensa del exgobernador de Antioquia, La Corte Suprema de Justicia otorgó la libertad condicional al exgobernador de Antioquia, [Luis Alfredo Ramos](https://www.wradio.com.co/2022/08/03/luis-alfredo-ramos-ha-sido-un-perseguido-abogado-tras-acusaciones-ante-la-jep/?rel=buscador_noticias), tras cumplir las 3/5 partes de la condena, esto además del “ejemplar comportamiento” que tuvo durante el tiempo que permaneció privado de la libertad. El exgobernador fue hallado culpable por el delito de concierto para delinquir con la finalidad de promover grupos armados ilegales, según recordó la Corte, fue una “conducta que consideró de gravedad superlativa, pues se le reprochó aliarse con las [organizaciones paramilitares](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/03/01/nos-dijo-que-eramos-unos-paramilitares-victima-de-la-policia-denuncia-a-maria-gaitan/?rel=buscador_noticias) que operaron principalmente en Antioquia, para recibir su apoyo económico y electoral a fin de salir electo senador de la República y luego gobernador de ese departamento a cambio de promoverlas, poniendo en su favor las funciones del cargo de congresista, permitiendo su expansión y la comisión de toda serie de atentados contra la población civil”. La Corte consideró el buen comportamiento, la dedicación por el estudio e incluso destacó la creación literaria del exgobernador. En contexto: “La Sala concluye que el doctor LUIS ALFREDO RAMOS BOTERO al presentarse ante las autoridades para cumplir la pena impuesta una vez cobró ejecutoria, estuvo dispuesto a asumir sus obligaciones penitenciarias intramurales, observando en el lugar de reclusión y durante todo el tiempo una conducta en la mayoría de los casos ejemplar, y en otros buena, dedicado al estudio y a la creación literaria”. Para el alto tribunal, eso demuestra “un adecuado proceso de resocialización o reinserción social como función y fin último de la pena en su fase de ejecución”. “RESUELVE: PRIMERO: REVOCAR el auto recurrido proferido por el Juzgado Primero de Ejecución de Penas y Medidas de Seguridad de Antioquia, mediante el cual negó la libertad condicional al sentenciado, doctor [LUIS ALFREDO RAMOS BOTERO.](https://www.wradio.com.co/2022/08/02/jep-senalan-a-luis-alfredo-ramos-de-reuniones-con-paras-sobre-limpieza-social/?rel=buscador_noticias) SEGUNDO: CONCEDER al doctor RAMOS BOTERO la libertad condicional, de conformidad con los argumentos expuestos en la parte considerativa de este auto, previo pago de la caución prendaria y la suscripción del acta de compromiso, por un periodo de prueba equivalente al tiempo que resta para el cumplimiento de la pena, lo que deberá verificar la autoridad judicial que vigila el cumplimiento de la pena. TERCERO: Una vez constituida la caución y suscrita la diligencia de compromiso ante el Juzgado Primero de Ejecución de Penas y Medidas de Seguridad de Antioquia, líbrese la boleta de libertad con destino al INPEC y al Complejo Penitenciario y Carcelario de Bello (Antioquia), autoridades por cuenta de quien se encuentra actualmente recluido en prisión intramural, si es que no tiene pedido de otra autoridad. CUARTO: REMITIR copia de este proveído al [INPEC ](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/02/29/salvatore-mancuso-esta-con-maximas-medidas-de-seguridad-director-del-inpec/?rel=buscador_noticias)y al Complejo Penitenciario y Carcelario de Bello (Antioquia), autoridades por cuenta de quien se encuentra actualmente recluido intramuralmente. QUINTO: Contra esta decisión no proceden recursos”, señala el fallo.",
