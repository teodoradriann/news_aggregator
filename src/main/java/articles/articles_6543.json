    "text": "Three men facing charges in the death of an Owen Sound, Ont., restaurant owner are fighting their extradition from Scotland with claims that Canadian jails are overcrowded and disease-ridden.\nSharif Rahman, 44, was attacked outside of The Curry House restaurant in downtown Owen Sound on Aug. 17, 2023, after confronting three men about an unpaid $150 bill. The 44-year-old husband and father of a young girl died a week later in a London, Ont., hospital.\nRobert Evans, 24, faces a charge of manslaughter. His father, Robert Busby Evans, 47, and his uncle, Barry Evans, 54, are charged with being accessories after the fact. All three remain in custody pending extradition proceedings.\nAt a preliminary hearing in Edinburgh Sheriff Court last week, their lawyer claimed that overcrowding and \"harsh conditions\" in Ontario provincial jails are \"known issues\" and should be considered in the extradition decision.\nThe lawyer also raised concerns about access to health care, citing an outbreak in March of streptococcal A disease that killed two inmates at the Maplehurst Correctional Complex in Milton, Ont.\nThe court was told that an expert's report on conditions at Canadian correctional institutions has been requested.\nSheriff Julius Komorowski, who presided over the hearing, instructed the prosecution to liaise with Ontario authorities to determine where the three men would be held if extradited and to seek assurances about jail conditions.\nNo family or friends of the accused were present during the proceedings.\nThree men charged in connection with Rahman's 2023 death are fighting extradition proceedings in court in Edinburgh, Scotland. (Edward Sharp-Paul for CBC News) The trio are scheduled to return to court in late April for the conclusion of the preliminary hearing.\nCanadian authorities have provided the public with scant information about the case, refusing to discuss why the accused were in the country, how and when they left, or details about the altercation that led to Rahman's death.\nIn August 2024, almost a year after the incident, police issued a brief news release saying arrests had been made.\nIt wasn't until Dec. 19 that investigators disclosed the names of the suspects and confirmed that the father and son had been apprehended in late July, and the uncle at the end of October.\nIn this photo from August 2023, people in Owen Sound, Ont., gathered near Sharif Rahman's restaurant following his funeral. (Michelle Both / CBC News) Ontario court documents about the case remain sealed.\nQuestions from CBC News about the case have gone unanswered, with the Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown and courts all saying there is no \"publicly available information\" to share.",

    "text": "AIArtificial Intelligence at War The Gaza war has shown that the use of AI in tactical targeting can drive military strategy by encouraging decision-making bias. At the start of the conflict, an Israeli Defense Force AI system called Lavender apparently identified 37,000 people linked to Hamas. Its function quickly shifted from gathering long-term intelligence to rapidly identifying individual operatives to target. There’s a [global arms race](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1) under way to work out how best to use artificial intelligence for military purposes. The Gaza and Ukraine wars are now accelerating this. These conflicts might inform Australia and others in the region as they prepare for a possible AI-fueled ‘ [hyperwar](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/july/hyperwar)’ closer to home, given that China envisages fighting wars using [automated decision-making](https://warontherocks.com/2021/10/schrodingers-military-challenges-for-the-chinas-military-modernization-ambitions/) under the rubric of what it calls ‘ [intelligentization](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/09/how-chinese-strategists-think-ai-will-power-military-leap-ahead/185409/)’. The Gaza war has shown that the use of AI in tactical targeting can drive military strategy by encouraging decision-making bias. At the start of the conflict, an Israeli Defense Force AI system called Lavender apparently [identified](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes) 37,000 people linked to Hamas. Its function quickly shifted from gathering long-term intelligence to rapidly identifying individual operatives to target. Foot soldiers were easier to [swiftly locate and attack](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/) than senior commanders, so they dominated the attack schedule. Lavender created a simplified digital model of the battlefield, allowing dramatically faster targeting and much higher rates of attacks than in earlier conflicts. Human analysts did review Lavender’s recommendations before authorizing attacks, but they quickly grew to trust it, considering it [more reliable](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/05/02/israel-military-artificial-intelligence-targeting-hamas-gaza-deaths-lavender/). Humans often spent only 20 seconds considering Lavender’s target recommendations before approving them. These human analysts displayed [automation bias](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brycehoffman/2024/03/10/automation-bias-what-it-is-and-how-to-overcome-it/) and [action bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/action-bias). Indeed, it could be said that Lavender was encouraging and amplifying these biases. In a way, the humans offloaded their thinking to the machine. Human-machine teams are considered by many, including the [Australian Defense Force](https://tasdcrc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ADF-Concept-Robotics.pdf), to be central to future warfighting. The way Lavender’s tactical targeting drove military strategy suggests that the AI machine part should be designed to work with humans on the task they are undertaking, not be treated as a part able to be quickly switched between different functions. Otherwise, humans might lose sight of the strategic or operational context and instead focus on the machine-generated answers. For example, the purpose-designed [Ukrainian GIS Arta system](https://asiatimes.com/2022/07/musks-tech-put-to-deadly-weapon-effect-in-ukraine/) takes a bottom-up approach to target selection by giving people a well-fused picture of the battlespace, not a recommendation derived opaquely of what to attack. It’s described as ‘ [Uber for artillery](https://www.newamerica.org/future-frontlines/blogs/how-ukraines-uber-for-artillery-is-leading-the-software-war-against-russia/)’. Human users apply the context as they understand it to decide what is to be targeted.",

Parts of Australia are set to face wet and potentially wild weather on New Years Eve and New Year's Day. BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms are possible for parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible in Queensland between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" Ms Scully said. \"Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia.\" Showers and storms are possible across parts of southern and eastern Australia, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria on December 29. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend concentrating in north-east NSW, and south-east and central Queensland. BoM said there are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday. BoM has encouraged the community to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings using the BOM Weather app and website. Queensland will also experience heatwave conditions along the east coast affecting Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and areas surrounding Cairns. Northern and Western Australia will also face heatwave conditions with temperatures reaching the mid to high 40 degree Celsius in some areas. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "title": "Jon Tester, the Largest Recipient of Lobbyist Cash in America, Dings Opponent for Taking Lobbyist Cash",
    "text": "Senator Jon Tester took more money from lobbyists than any senator last year. Now, the Montana Democrat claims his Republican opponent is captive to private interests.\nTester’s new $640,000 television ad campaign claims Tim Sheehy, who secured the Republican Senate nomination Tuesday, is \"shady,\" because he’s \"taken hundreds of thousands in lobbyist cash.\"\nLobbyists have donated more than $458,000 to Tester from 2023-2024, besting his Democratic colleague Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.), who raised $356,169. No Senate Republican incumbent comes close to Tester, who received more money from lobbyists than former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.).\nTester faces one of the Senate's toughest reelection fights in November, in a state former president Donald Trump won by more than 16 points. In his fight to cling to his seat, Tester has attempted to brand himself as an independent dedicated to good governance.\nThat image often conflicts with reality. Tester votes with President Joe Biden 91 percent of the time, even as he avoids calling himself a Democrat in campaign ads.\nHe is also a long opponent of dark money but happily accepts help from the dark money groups that spend millions on his behalf. A super PAC connected to Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) spent nearly $6 million to boost Sheehy’s primary challenger, who was seen as the weaker of the two candidates.\nTester recently introduced a proposal to bolster his moderate credentials: a balanced budget constitutional amendment. In his 17 years in the Senate, Tester voted against similar measures at least eight times as the federal debt ballooned by 400 percent.\nIn April, the Tester campaign launched a $14.5 million ad campaign featuring footage of the southern border wall. Tester voted against border wall funding in 2017, calling Trump’s proposal \"ineffective and wasteful.\"",

Der Unglücksort befindet etwa 30 Kilometer südlich des Zentrums von Los Angeles.&nbsp; Ersten Berichten der Feuerwehr zufolge gelang es einigen Arbeitern nach dem Einsturz, über einen Berg loser Erde zu klettern. Auf der anderen Seite trafen sie demnach auf Kollegen. Anschließend seien die Eingeschlossenen mit einem Tunneltransportmittel zum Ausgang gebracht worden. Sanitäter versorgten daraufhin die Geretteten und untersuchten sie genauer, hieß es.&nbsp; Ein großer Rettungseinsatz&nbsp; Mehr als 100 Einsatzkräfte waren nach Angaben der Feuerwehr zum Unglücksort geeilt, darunter spezialisierte Rettungsteams. Der Einsturz passierte demnach mehr als acht Kilometer vom einzigen Tunneleingang entfernt. Es handele sich um einen im Bau befindlichen Tunnel für die kommunale Abwasserentsorgung, hieß es weiter. Die Ermittlungen zur Ursache des Einsturzes dauern an.&nbsp; Etwa eine Stunde waren die Arbeiter in dem Tunnel eingeschlossen, meldete CBS News. Der Tunnel sei insgesamt mehr als 11 Kilometer lang und etwas mehr als fünf Meter breit, schrieb der US-Sender unter Berufung auf den Betreiber.",

    "text": "Bergamo. Ebbene sì, oggi, giovedì 23 gennaio, si è inaugurata la 12esima edizione della Festa del Cioccolato, ormai considerata una tradizione per Bergamo.\nInfatti, viene piacevolmente apprezzata dai cittadini perché rappresenta un modo di vivere la città e di stare in compagnia.\nCiò nonostante, la festa non finisce qui, perché non è solo il cioccolato ad unire gli animi, ma bensì anche la collaborazione dei maestri del cioccolato provenienti da tutta Italia e non solo. Infatti, quest’anno anche il Belgio e l’Ungheria hanno partecipato, portando dunque l’Europa all’interno di questo appuntamento tipicamente bergamasco.\nMa dal punto di vista emotivo? Niente panico! I venditori sono super disponibili a farti assaggiare i loro prodotti ed il tempo è stabile e freddo, ma a scaldare i cuori non sono solo le barrette e le praline ma anche la cioccolata calda, tanto che l’apertura di questo evento è stata memorabile.\nLa sindaca Elena Carnevali, il vice sindaco Sergio Gandi, l’assessore ai Servizi Sociali Marcella Messina e l’assessore alle Politiche Abitative Claudia Lenzini hanno versato 21 metri di cioccolato temperato sul Sentierone, ove oltre trenta persone si sono radunate ad assistere a questo particolare battesimo della storica kermesse cittadina. Dopo soli 10 minuti, il cioccolato era già pronto per essere tagliato, condiviso e mangiato: cioccolato fondente davvero squisito!\nInoltre, ce n’è per tutti i gusti: una dozzina di bancarelle vendono cioccolato con forme di personaggi dal film Frozen, dal videogioco Super Mario, dal mitico cartone di Hello Kitty e tanti altri, insieme alle classiche proposte come le torte. Senza dimenticare anche i teneri animaletti tutti da mangiare tra i quali i panda, i cani e le giraffe!\nQuindi, cosa aspettate a venire ad assaporare un po’ di dolcissimo cioccolato? La festa è aperta tutti i giorni dalle 9 della mattina fino alle 19 della sera, da oggi (giovedì 23 gennaio) fino a domenica 26 gennaio.",

    "text": "Staying colder today with scattered snow showers\nSAGINAW, Mich. (WNEM) - More snow showers will move through mid-Michigan today, some of which has already come through early this morning. These early-morning snow showers have been steady enough to bring light accumulations on roadways, so remember to drive to the current conditions! There haven’t been any major delays but bridges and overpasses in particular could stay slick.\nThe longer outlook continues to support below-freezing temperatures. This will be good for our area ice fishers! While we’re lacking ice again right now, we’ll be building ice back up through the coming week. Snowmobilers and skiers, now we have the cold air in place... we just need the snow! [Click here](https://www.wnem.com/weather/forecast/7-day/) for a look ahead at the cold 7-Day First Alert Forecast!\nToday\nThis morning there’s already a light coating of fresh snow on many roadways from the Bay Region and south. Though we haven’t had any major issues regarding delays, you still might want to factor a few extra minutes into your routine this morning!\nScattered snow showers will continue today due to the wind direction being more favorable again: northwesterly. Additionally, a weak disturbance passing through has been just enough to bring some favorable large-scale dynamics too, essentially conditions which are able to make snow more efficiently. The scattered nature of these snow showers today will last most of the daytime in an on-and-off fashion. By this evening though, most activity will start coming to an end.\nRoscommon County is highlighted specifically by a [Winter Weather Advisory](https://www.wnem.com/weather/alerts/). There, the lake-effect will be a little bit more frequent than the rest of our area, leading to locally higher snow totals. While Ogemaw County is not included, some of these bands could reach into there at times too. Overall, most of mid-Michigan only sees a dusting or light coating out of today’s snow showers, while Roscommon specifically could see totals as high as 2″ to 5″. The northern Thumb could also have a slightly higher total given some enhancement from the Saginaw Bay, but those totals have a ceiling at just 2″.\nHighs today will reach 26 degrees with the northwest wind sustained at 10 to 15 mph, gusting to 25 mph. This wind is the same speed as the last few days now. Wind chills will be in the middle teens at best. The normal high for January 3rd is 31 degrees.\nTonight\nOther than a stray flurry, a dry night is ahead with mostly cloudy skies. Lows will fall to 16 degrees though with the same northwest wind holding on. Be prepared for single digit wind chills on Saturday morning if you’re heading out for any early errands or activities!\nWeekend Forecast\nThis weekend is generally on the quieter-side of the coin by winter standards! Temperatures will remain cold, but snow chances are minimal. We’ll start with mostly cloudy skies Saturday before turning partly cloudy late in the day. Clouds will then build back in on Sunday. During this time, only a stray flurry or two are possible. The better chance of snowfall will be in the northern Lower Peninsula.\nHighs will only reach 23 degrees Saturday, if not, even colder for some. Lows will fall to 15 degrees on Saturday night. Highs reach 25 degrees on Sunday. The same northwest wind gusting to 25 mph from Friday will hold on all weekend long too. Again, while cold, it’ll be quiet! We hope you have a great weekend and kick off 2025 on a great note!\nCopyright 2025 WNEM. All rights reserved.",

However, the sacraments are reserved for Catholics who have been baptized and confirmed in the church. What Is The Significance of The Eucharist in The Roman Catholic Church? The Eucharist is a central sacrament in the Roman Catholic Church, and it refers to the bread and wine that are consecrated during mass and represent the body and blood of Christ. The Eucharist is a symbol of the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ and is believed to be the source of spiritual nourishment that is essential for Christians. What Are The Seven Sacraments Observed by The Roman Catholic Church?

However, the support and community found in the Roman Catholic Church, along with the guidance and teachings of the faith, can help navigate these challenges and stay faithful to the church. Is It Difficult to Become a Roman Catholic? Becoming a Roman Catholic involves a process of religious education, baptism, confirmation, and participation in the sacraments. It is not difficult to become a Roman Catholic, but it requires a willingness to learn, connect with the Church’s teachings, and devote oneself to the Catholic community and traditions. Parish priests and religious education instructors can guide people interested in becoming Roman Catholics through the process.",
