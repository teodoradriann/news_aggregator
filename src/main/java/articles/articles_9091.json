    "text": "Hoops, Rap and Everything Black: Pooh Jeter is All About Serving Others, Whether He’s on the Court or Sidelines\nPooh Jeter is many things: a Los Angeles native, a mid-major product and an overseas hoop legend, to name a few. And now you can add NBA player development coach and G League assistant GM to the list. But there’s one identifier that’s the foundation of Pooh’s entire existence. Above everything else, Pooh is a man of faith.\nHe’s made it abundantly clear that he finds his life’s purpose in helping serve others and providing light in times of darkness. After a spectacular career at the University of Portland, the undersized point guard went undrafted in the 2006 NBA Draft. But his faith didn’t allow that to deter him from his goal of becoming a professional basketball player.\nHe’d end up having a 17-year pro career that spanned a handful of countries and a brief stint in the NBA with the Sacramento Kings in 2010-11. Last year, he announced his retirement as a player after spending his last two seasons as a player/mentor with the NBA G League Ignite.\nHe followed up his retirement with news that he’d be joining the Portland Trail Blazers as a player development coach and their G League affiliate, the Rip City Remix, as an assistant GM.\nPooh pulled up to the SLAM office and chopped it up about everything: his new dual role with the Trail Blazers, his transition from player to coach, founding the Black Coaches Association, what community means to him and more.\nThis interview has been slightly edited for clarity and conciseness.\nSLAM: I appreciate you for being here, first things first. We’ll get into a few things, but I want to start with your latest accomplishment, becoming a coach in the League. How’d that come about?\nPooh Jeter: First, praise God that we’re able to have this conversation and speak on the SLAM platform. This is huge. You know, me being in this new role–I wasn’t expecting it. I was really expecting to still be playing with Ignite, until I got this opportunity from Mike Schmitz, the assistant GM [for the Portland Trail Blazers] and a longtime friend of mine. He had an idea of this dual role, in the front office and coaching. Once Chauncey Billups—who I’ve been knowing since ’05—found out, he was like, I need him too! So it just made sense to have this role of being a player development coach [for the Trail Blazers], and also being assistant GM of our NBA G League [Rip City] Remix team.\nSLAM: So, what’s Coach Pooh like?\nPJ: Coach Pooh is—I’m still a hooper. But I’m able to share my experiences. One thing I know about player development is people don’t think about the development part. That’s not just basketball. Me being in this role, I’m still like a teammate since I just recently made this transition. For me to be able to tap in for you to bring out your best don’t really gotta do with basketball; we’re human beings as well. I think the trust that players have with me, they’re able to really let me know what’s going on with them. Because, the basketball stuff is—I’ll be able to help with that, for sure.\nSLAM: How’s that transition from player to coach/front office executive been for you since announcing your retirement last year?\nPJ: The transition has been amazing, man. The last two years I played with G League Ignite really helped me make my transition even better. I still get down and practice, which is cool. I’m one of the only people in the League with this role. It’s an amazing balance; I’m able to really talk to both sides. I’ve experienced so much and it’s not meant for me to hold it, it’s for me to share. My whole mission is refreshing others; that’s what I’m about.\nSLAM: In another interview, you mentioned how important it is for you to share information with your community first. Can you speak to this a bit more? What does community mean to you?\nPJ: Community is everything to me, wherever I’m at. We gotta fix within if we want to do things on the outside. Once you focus on that part, everything is gonna take care of itself. That comes with information, that comes with love. Coming from the inner city, you really have to tap into that to really change narratives. That’s the whole point of me being a messenger and servant. I gotta serve. Once I’m able to do that, [the younger generation] is gonna do the same. It starts with community.\nSLAM: I want to touch on the Black Coaches Association (BCA). How did that come about and what are you trying to do with it?\nPJ: BCA really started with coaches John Thompson, Nolan Richardson, George Raveling and John Chaney around the late ’80s. Then it just went away. I had a conversation with Coach Jason Hart—he’s somebody I really look up to for a lot of different reasons. He was venting to me, because at that time (and now) the Pac-12 didn’t have a Black head coach. That’s weird for a Power Five conference—like, why?! Well, I’m really into trademarks and once I saw Black Coaches Association/BCA was available, I got on it. So then, with the relationships that I do have, here comes [a long list of Black coaches] that became members of the association. I was still a player at the time, and there was so much going on in the world. I just wanted to make sure these coaches were alright mental health-wise. Everybody started making their calls and it got big! We probably have 2,500 Black coaches in our database.\nNow that I’m on the sidelines, I’m looking at other pro players who want to get into coaching. Again, it’s about who we’re getting our information from. I’m just tryna do something to make sure the community—my community—is prepared for the opportunity. Black Coaches Association is my baby. It’s a real passion and priority of mine.\nSLAM: What’s left for Pooh to do in the game of basketball?\nPJ: I’m gonna go to this scripture in the Bible: “even though I have plans in my heart, God directs my steps.” I have to continue to pray and just be aligned with the steps we’re on and hopefully, these steps are leading somewhere. You know, I wasn’t expecting to be a coach and in the front office; that wasn’t my plan. I just pray that my steps are being directed in the right way, with God. One of the requirements is to walk humbly; I’m just trying to walk humbly and make sure God’s will is done.\nHere’s the official Hoops, Rap and Everything Black playlist. It’s updated regularly. Add the playlist to your library to stay in the know, and be sure to follow SLAM on Spotify.\nPhotos by Marcus Stevens.",

La Dirección Xeral de Emerxencias ha activado la alerta naranja para mañana, sábado, por temporal costero en el litoral de la provincia de A Coruña.\nSegún la Aemet, el fenómeno meteorológico adverso empezará a media tarde del sábado, sobre las 18:00 horas, en la costa coruñesa y se extenderá el domingo a todo el litoral gallego. Las peores horas en la costa coruñesa serán durante la tarde del sábado, desde las 18:00 horas hasta la medianoche.\nHabrá mar combinada del oeste con olas de hasta siete metros y vientos del suroeste de fuerza siete.\nLa borrasca va a dejar también rachas de vientos de nivel de alaerta amarilla en las franjas costeras de A Coruña y de Lugo.\nAnte esta situación, desde la Xunta recuerdan la importancia de mantenerse alejado de la línea de costa, como diques o paseos marítimos. También se piden que se extremen las medidas de seguridad a la hora de realizar cualquier actividad en el mar y que se revisen los cabos y amarres de las embarcaciones.\nLa borrasca Gerrit llegó a Galicia, dejando en las últimas horas lluvias por prácticmente toda la geografía gallega. Hoy las lluvias se reptirán en muchos puntos de la ciudad, mientras que en otros habrá un pequeña tregua hasta el domingo, Nochevieja, cuando se prevé una jornada en la que las lluvias sean las protagonistas.",

    "text": "Huge crowds hit Boxing Day sales despite slow start to the morningAussies are expected to spend more than $1billion this year READ MORE: Ten of the best Boxing Day deals on Amazon\nLarge crowds have descended on Australia’s shopping precincts to grab a Boxing Day bargain, despite the cost-of-living crunch tightening household budgets.\nThousands of shoppers ventured out for the sales with Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne teeming by the middle of the day after a very quiet early morning.\nIn previous years it was common for long queues to be forming from sunrise, with hundreds clamouring to be the first to rush through the doors when retailers opened.\nBut it seems the shift to online shopping along with stubbornly high inflation hasn’t dulled the enthusiasm for one of the biggest shopping days of the year.\n‘Boxing Day is the grand final of Australia’s favourite sport, shopping,’ Australian Retailers Association boss Paul Zahra said.\nBoxing Day sales are underway across Australia with large crowds turning out for one of the year’s biggest shopping days (pictured is Sydney)\nAustralians are expected to spend $1.25billion on December 26 according to the Australian Retailers Association (pictured: shoppers in Sydney)\nShoppers lined up outside Pandora in Sydney’s Pitt St Mall on Tuesday\nBy 12pm Sydney’s CBD was bustling despite hardly anyone lining up earlier in the morning\nThe association estimates Australians will splurge $1.25 billion on the ‘unprecedented’ bargains as shoppers try to stretch their dollars further during discounts and sales.\nSome retail experts forecast that Australians will spend big at the shops on Boxing Day because of the cost-of-living pressure not despite it, as they opt to find that item they’ve been eyeing for a cheaper price.\nThough it may have sparked some concern from retailers earlier in the morning with hardly anyone seen at Sydney’s Pitt St Mall.\nIt was a little busier in Melbourne’s Bourke St Mall with a small crowd of about 200 people lined up outside David Jones when it opened at 7.30am and another 100 walking through Myer’s doors when it opened half an hour later.\nIn both cities it was a long way from previous years when extra security guards have to be hired to shepherd the hoards of stampeding shoppers rushing through the doors as they opened.\nIt might have caused retailers to worry when the Sydney’s CBD appeared to be deserted about 7am but crowds picked up\nSydney was a ghost town earlier on Tuesday morning on contrast to previous years where shoppers would line up to be the first through the doors\nThe crowd outside Myer as doors opened was subdued compared to just a few years ago\nShoppers weren’t appearing too fazed by the cost of living crunch with many seen lugging away multiple shopping bags\nSuburban shopping centres could even see bigger crowds than their CBD counterparts with Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne expecting more than 150,000 visitors on December 26.\nAustralia’s biggest bank expects almost one in two people to participate in the sales, spending an estimated $4.6 billion in total.\nCommonwealth Bank personal finance expert Jess Irvine said while more people are planning to shop the Boxing Day sales than in previous years, people are planning to spend less.\nThe average planned spend this year is $475.70 compared to a planned average spend of $483.20 in 2022 and $557.05 in 2021.\nThe driving demographic involved in Boxing Day shopping are those aged 39 and under, reflecting data from a recent CommBank IQ cost of living report which found younger Australians are feeling the most pain from rising prices.\n‘Aussie household budgets are being squeezed on multiple fronts, so it is not surprising that individual shoppers are tightening their belts,’ Ms Irvine said.\nDavid Jones and Myer, have been preparing for one of the biggest days on their shopping calendar.\nDavid Jones alone anticipates up to one million customers through its doors and online during the week-long bargain period across all departments.\nFor those looking for a change of scenery, Qantas and subsidiary Jetstar are offering discounted one-way fares on almost every domestic and some international routes in the second half of 2024.\nHuge discounts drew in shoppers at David Jones in Pitt St with the retailer expecting 1million customers to shop at the store either in person or online on December 26\nMany shoppers braved the crowds and potential for rain as they shopped in Sydney\nCrowds queue in Sydney on Boxing Day despite a shift to online shopping\nRetail experts said Aussies will be out in force at the sales as they try and make their dollar go further amid high inflation\nAs shoppers transition from Christmas, so do their spending behaviours, Mr Zahra said.\n‘In the lead up to Christmas, shoppers are focused on buying gifts for their family and loved ones,’ he said.\n‘Post-Christmas, Australians typically turn their attention to purchases for themselves and their household, focused on snagging a bargain.’\nAussies who face buyer’s remorse amid the rush or want to return unwanted gifts are being warned by NSW Fair Trading to know their rights.\nIf a product is not of acceptable quality, does not match the description or is not fit for purpose, customers may be entitled to a repair, replacement or refund under consumer law.\nCustomers have the same legal refund rights on sale items as they would have on full-price products unless they were informed of a fault before the purchase.\n‘Retailers have a responsibility to ensure their products meet required standards but consumers also need to do their homework before they buy or they might get caught out,’ Fair Trading Commissioner John Tansey said.",
