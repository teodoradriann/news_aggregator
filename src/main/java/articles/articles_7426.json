    "text": "A Bold Shift in Strategy\nIn a game marked by unexpected turns, the Orioles have embraced a tactical pivot that underscores the value of experience when present challenges demand swift action. The decision to call upon veteran pitcher Charlie Morton from the bullpen reveals a readiness to adapt when the season’s early narratives veer off course.\nEvaluating Early Season Adjustments\nThe setback came quickly as Kyle Gibson, stepping into his inaugural start of the year, faced more obstacles than triumphs. While expectations hovered above his performance, the outcome fell notably short. Recognizing the need for immediate impact, the coaching staff opted for a familiar and reliable presence to stabilize the situation. This decisive move not only reorients the team’s focus in the midst of performance inconsistencies but also highlights the importance of leveraging seasoned expertise in tumultuous moments.\nThe Veteran’s Role in Critical Moments\nCharlie Morton’s entry into the bullpen marks both a strategic fallback and a deliberate pivot towards reliability during uncertain times. With a history of stepping up under pressure, Morton’s assignment now is to provide crucial innings when the situation demands measured calm and tactical acumen. This role, though different from a traditional starting performance, speaks volumes about his adaptability and the trust placed in him by the leadership. His seasoned perspective and controlled approach are seen as essential ingredients to bridge the gap left by earlier unforeseen shortcomings on the mound.\nInsights into Team Dynamics and Future Implications\nThis recalibration in pitching strategy serves as more than just a reactive measure; it reflects an underlying commitment to flexibility, ensuring that every challenge is met with the best available resource. Veteran endorsements like Morton instill confidence in the team, reminding everyone that adaptability is fundamental to long-term success. As the season unfolds, embracing such shifts may well be the catalyst for unlocking new momentum and refining overall team performance.\nReflecting on the Road Ahead\nThe Orioles’ willingness to adjust their approach amid early struggles encapsulates a broader lesson in sports: sometimes, seasoned wisdom is the key to navigating unpredictable twists. By entrusting critical moments to a reliable veteran, the team signals a measured approach that balances ambition with practical experience. Ultimately, this strategic choice not only aims to resolve immediate concerns but also sets a reflective tone for future decision-making—a reminder that every setback can be transformed into an opportunity for growth and resilience.",

    "text": "DOWNTOWN MADISON | HOLY REDEEMER Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in Downtown Madison was damaged by fire Friday morning after its steeple was apparently struck by lightning. The first call about a fire at the historic church, at 120 W. Johnson St., came in at 11:17 a.m., about 10 minutes after witnesses reported hearing an extraordinarily loud boom in the area, likely from a lightning strike, Madison Fire Department spokesperson Cynthia Schuster said. When firefighters arrived four minutes later, Schuster said, flames could be seeing coming from around the clock in the front of the steeple. Firefighters attacked the fire from inside the church and from ladder trucks outside. By 11:30, witnesses could see smoke still spilling from the steeple but no flames as firefighters cut a hole in the base of the steeple and then hit it with a high-pressure hose, peeling back many of the copper shingles. The fire was fully extinguished at 12:29, Schuster said. People are also reading… \"The steeple has intricate construction within it, which made it a challenge for firefighters to fully get to the source,\" she said. Two people, including a cleaner, were inside the church at the time but were unaware of the fire, she said. No injuries were reported. The Rev. Drew Olson, the parish priest, said he was at St. James Catholic School on the Near West Side when he heard the news. A volunteer at the school had shown him a picture of a steeple on fire. At first, he said, he thought he was looking at an old picture of St. Raphael Cathedral, the former seat of the Madison Catholic Diocese that was destroyed in an arson fire 19 years ago. \"At first I was like, 'Why are you showing me this?'\" he said. \"I thought it was St. Raphael's at first, just because what other church in downtown Madison has smoke around the top of it?\" But quickly realizing it was Holy Redeemer after a flood of phone calls and messages from parishioners, Olson said he rushed to the church with one main mission: to save the Blessed Sacrament. By the time he arrived, firefighters were already inside the building, and the Blessed Sacrament had already been removed. \"It was all isolated to the tower, so that's a huge relief,\" Olson said of the blaze. Later Friday, the Diocese of Madison said the fire never managed to spread beyond the upper portion of the steeple, but minor smoke damage occurred throughout the building. Additionally, the large amount of water used to extinguish the fire caused damage to the \"back third of the church,\" which will require significant cleanup. \"Hearing of a church fire in downtown Madison brings back difficult memories for many of us,\" Bishop Donald Hying said Friday. \"I am grateful that no one was injured and extend my deepest appreciation to the Madison Fire Department.\" Holy Redeemer is the oldest active Catholic church in the city after St. Raphael Cathedral burned in 2005. It was designated a historic landmark by the city in 1983. The church was founded in 1857 to serve Madison's German-speaking Catholic population, according to the parish website, which describes Holy Redeemer as the \"the most traditionally decorated church in the city.\" Most of the city's German-speaking Catholic residents lived near the West Johnson Street site when the original church was built. That building was replaced by the existing church in the late 1860s, according to a Landmarks Commission historical marker. The first steeple was \"greatly damaged by a heavy storm\" in 1873, according to a timeline published by The Capital Times nearly a century ago. The steeple was rebuilt in 1880, and the four-faced clock — a gift from a member of the congregation — was added in 1881. At least one of the clock faces appeared to be damaged by Friday's blaze. Prayers and Sunday services will be suspended until the building can be repaired, Olson said. Masses, liturgies and other activities that would normally be at Holy Redeemer will be moved to other diocesan churches until a safety assessment can be made.

    "text": "Much has been said and written about the huge economic benefit Singapore gained by being the sole stop in South-east Asia for Taylor Swift’s tour ( Hosting Taylor Swift: For Singapore, the impact goes way beyond money, March 13). Indeed, the event was a huge success, creating both social and economic impacts unseen before. Kudos to all involved. Although not a fan myself, I was nonetheless intrigued enough to read and watch many articles and clips by those who were at the concerts. What was most striking to me were the scenes outside the National Stadium, where non-ticket holders congregated and enjoyed the music coming from within the stadium. Many women, young and not so young, were dancing and singing among strangers. They were able to do that in Singapore because we are a society that offers a safe space for them to enjoy good clean fun without fear of being arrested, molested or robbed. We Singaporeans often take this for granted, but unfortunately many women around the world do not enjoy such freedom. Then it was the sight of strangers from different races, faiths and languages at close range with one another and being happy with that. In today’s messed-up world, it was delightful seeing them having a chance to enjoy the night with strangers. Singapore holds much potential to be a little oasis. We often forget how special we are in our ability to be comfortable with different cultures, beliefs and languages. Lim Mei Ling",

Ayanna Montes and her three children were headed south on Interstate 95 about 80 miles from Jacksonville on Dec. 25 when their vehicle went off the highway, struck a pole, rolled, and ended up in a ditch with about three feet of water, the Volusia County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office said in a statement posted on Passersby helped the family, which suffered some minor injuries, out of the vehicle before first responders arrived. However, when sheriff's deputies and City of Ormond Beach firefighters got there they learned all of the family's Christmas presents were in the submerged car. The firefighters used a ladder to get to the submerged vehicle and, along with the deputies, created a human chain to pass the gifts, some with soggy wrapping paper, out of the wrecked vehicle. Deputies took them back to the sheriff's office to dry and added a \"few extra donated gifts to bring to the hospital,\" the City of Ormond Beach posted on 'Unimaginable': [Long Island police searching for person who stabbed dog 17 times](/story/news/nation/2023/12/29/dog-stabbed-17-times-survives-long-island-police-search-attacker/72056760007/) Back at home, the family's mother told [WKMG](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2023/12/25/christmas-is-saved-human-chain-saves-gifts-after-car-goes-into-ditch-family-rescued-in-volusia-county/), a CBS TV station in Orlando, “I was just in shock,” after the accident. “My daughter’s face had glass everywhere.

As a result, approximately 9 million more Latinos now have health insurance coverage.\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that over half of Hispanic and Latino adults remain inadequately insured, raising concerns about the quality of coverage.\nTo shed light on this issue, we spoke with Bibi Heredia, a WISH-TV contributor, who joined News 8 to talk about the issue.\nWhile the number of Latinos with health insurance has risen, many still face gaps in their coverage. According to Heredia, a significant portion of the Latino population struggles with plans that do not meet their needs, particularly regarding high deductibles, and those that lack mental health care or preventative screenings.\nHeredia said language barriers can play a role as well. Other issues are that some people find that their insurance plans do not cover essential health services, or the coverage provided is limited, leaving them with high out-of-pocket expenses.\nHeredia said that without proper insurance, many Latinos may delay seeking medical care or avoid necessary treatments, which can exacerbate chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Early detection and preventative care are often missed, leading to worse health outcomes over time.\nFinancially, inadequate insurance coverage means that many Latino families are burdened with rising out-of-pocket costs. Heredia explained that the financial strain of paying for medical expenses out of pocket, especially for those with low incomes, can push families deeper into poverty and create long-term economic instability.\nHeredia suggests that health insurance plans need to be better tailored to meet the unique needs of the Latino community. This includes ensuring that insurance coverage is more comprehensive and affordable.\n1",

    "title": "Let the Holy Spirit Reveal the Mystery of the Cross",
    "text": "True devotion to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit leads to one end: the Cross — the true and supreme glorification of the Father, the highest expression of love on earth, the central point of the will of God. Let us examine carefully this doctrine that brings us to the core of Christianity, whose greatest revelation is the mystery of the Cross, whose life-giving source is the Eucharist, the divine perpetuation of that mystery, and whose secret means of leading souls to God is participation in the sacrifice of Jesus. St. Paul did not wish to know anything “except Jesus Christ and Him crucified,” nor did he wish to glory in anything but the Cross of Christ, in which is our salvation, our life, and our resurrection. To glorify God is to recognize and proclaim His infinite excellence and omnipotent sovereignty over all creation. Irrational creatures that display the divine marks given them by the hand of the Creator glorify God indirectly, as St. John of the Cross expresses it in the inimitable lines of his “Spiritual Canticle”: Scattering a thousand graces He passed through these groves in haste, And, looking upon them as He went, Left them, by His glance alone, Clothed with beauty. And the Scriptures tell us, “The heavens declare the glory of God” and “the earth is full of His praise.” But only rational creatures glorify God directly, for they alone can know, or at least have a glimpse of, infinite grandeur, and be led to praise it and to efface themselves before it in loving subjection. Scriptures present the saints prostrating themselves before God’s majesty. The clearer the knowledge of God and the more profound the self-effacement of the creature, the more perfect is the glorification. After the Fall, the glorification of God was tinged, so to speak, with the color of expiation required by divine justice, and the self-effacement of the creature was changed into the humiliation of pain and death. The people of Israel, instructed by God, and other peoples of the world, guided by the remains of primitive revelation, understood that supreme glorification required sacrifice, in which the victim was destroyed in honor of the Supreme Being. But those ancient sacrifices were not sufficient in themselves for either expiation or glorification. How could sin-stained creatures satisfy divine justice? How could they who had not received the perfect revelation of infinite greatness, perfectly glorify God? God rejected the ancient sacrifices and accomplished a stupendous prodigy of justice and mercy, of wisdom and love, in the sublime sacrifice of Calvary in which Jesus — most pure Victim, capable of offering a sacrifice of infinite value — offered to God a complete and superabundant expiation for sin and, at the same time, gave Him the most perfect glorification. God dies to glorify God! Jesus, knowing infinite goodness better than anyone, immolated Himself on the Cross with unfathomable love! Who but God can know the sublime fullness, the ineffable perfection, of this supreme glorification? And once the divine mystery is accomplished, there remains but to perpetuate it, to crystallize it, to make it immortal. Jesus has done this by giving us the incredible miracle of the Eucharist. Perhaps in Heaven we shall see that glorification and love are the same: that only love glorifies God, and that in glorification alone does love find its rest and its peace. On earth we do not see this. We have to separate the things of God and painfully examine their various aspects, and only then rebuild the divine reality in our imperfect way, by bringing together our scattered concepts. The Cross, the supreme glorification of God, is also the supreme expression of love. Love is surrender; it is giving; it is the sweet communication of our whole being with that of the Beloved. It is the divine strength that makes us efface ourselves in honor of the One we love; the power to lose all so as to give all; the knowledge of the exquisite delight of our incredible poverty, of our perfect divestment, of our ineffable humility. In these, the Beloved will become our wealth, our happiness, our glory, our all. We read in the Holy Gospel that the kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sells all he has in order to buy a precious pearl or a field in which a great treasure is hidden.144 These are symbols of love. Supreme love is the infinite surrender, the complete communication, the ineffable giving, of the three divine Persons in the bosom of God. God is charity, and His intimate life is the mystery of the unutterable donations of love. The love of the creature, since it is a reflection of eternal love, is also a total and most sweet donation. The angels accomplish it in the peace and joy of their spiritual and immaculate nature. On earth, the supreme donation of love cannot be made except in pain and death. This might seem to be an imperfection, yet this wretchedness of ours is the occasion of exquisite happiness, singular glory. Give me a lover, says Augustine, and he will understand what I am saying! To know that we die for the One we love, that our destruction is His joy, that we can purchase a smile from His lips at the price of death and sorrow — is not this the highest delight and joy of love? Love without pain is truly insipid and imperfect. It is not that we have chosen this way of love. The God of Heaven, who enjoys the delights of infinite love, willed to love in this way, and He performed prodigies in order to die of love and pain on the Cross. “In this we have come to know His love, that He laid down His life for us,”145 said St. John, and his words have been repeated by all souls in love with God. By dying on the Cross for us, Jesus showed to what lengths God would go in His love for man; by dying for the glory of the Father, He expressed the depth of the love of man for God. The Cross is the supreme symbol of this love. In the letter to the Hebrews, quoted earlier, St. Paul reveals the mystery of the will of God: “Therefore, in coming into the world, He says, ‘Sacrifice and oblation Thou wouldst not, but a body Thou hast fitted to me. In holocausts and sin-offerings Thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, “Behold, I come. . . to do Thy will, O God!” ’ ” And in this will, adds St. Paul, we were sanctified, in the unique offering of the body of Jesus Christ. Each one of the mysteries of Jesus, each instant of His life, is the fulfillment of His Father’s will, but we have St. Paul’s revelation that the coordinating center of all the divine dispositions is the Cross. God wills many things that are in reality but one thing. For unity is the mark of all that is His, a rich unity that holds the universe in magnificent harmony. The human artist, in his masterpiece, wills and arranges all the elements, lights and shadows, colors and figures, seeking in this variety a central theme that will unify and harmonize the artistic elements, and which is the key to the work and the reason for its beauty. The divine Artist has willed many things: the earth with all its marvels, history and all its vicissitudes, the supernatural order with all its prodigies. Yet among this immense variety, His gaze, His search, His love, are only for Jesus Crucified. The Cross is the key to God’s magnificent work, the secret of its unity and beauty, the coordinating principle of the world and history, of time and eternity. Therefore, St. Paul could say that the will of the Father was accomplished by the oblation of the body of Christ, and that we are sanctified in that will. The devotion to the Father that filled the soul of Jesus — that soul great beyond measure — had the Cross for its terminus. Only on the Cross was His longing to glorify the Father satisfied, His immense hunger for doing the will of the Father appeased; only there did His infinite love attain rest. The loving dream of Jesus during His mortal life was the Cross; He longed for it as only the heart of the Man-God could long for the culmination of all His infinite aspirations. Although He hid His supreme secret under the mantle of divine serenity, it escaped Him as a perfume escapes its containing vial. It undoubtedly revealed itself at Nazareth, to be received in Mary’s heart; and again, in intimate conversations with His Apostles, as when He said, “I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how distressed I am until it is accomplished,” and that other time in the Cenacle, when Jesus carried in His heart for thirty-three years the cruel, torturing martyrdom of longing for sacrifice and of waiting for the hour appointed by the heavenly Father. Therefore, His devotion to the Father had a definitive form — sacrifice; a clear symbol — the Cross; and a precise formula — “Christ. . . through the Holy Spirit offered Himself unblemished unto God.” ✠ This article is from a chapter in Archbishop Martinez’s True Devotion to the Holy Spirit , available from Sophia Institute Press.",
