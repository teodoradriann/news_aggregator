    "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Tx — The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has vacated the capital murder conviction of Joe David Padron, agreeing that false testimony led to his wrongful conviction for a 2002 double homicide.\nThe court's ruling comes after Nueces County District Court Judge Inna Klein determined that prosecutors presented false testimony during Padron's original trial.\nPadron, who was initially sentenced to life in prison for the shooting deaths of two men in a Corpus Christi drug house, served 19 years before being released on bail in 2023, pending the court's decision.\nMike Ware, Executive Director of the Innocence Project of Texas and Padron's attorney, emphasized the significance of the court's decision. \"Both Judge Klein and the Court of Criminal Appeals recognized that two of the prosecution’s witnesses gave false testimony causing Mr. Padron’s wrongful conviction. Although nothing can give back the time he spent wrongfully imprisoned, we are hopeful that this ruling will give Joe David and his family some sense of justice and the peace they deserve,\" Ware said.\nThe case's exoneration was bolstered by additional evidence, including testimony that one of the actual perpetrators of the murders confessed, specifically named the three other perpetrators he committed the murders with, and that Padron had nothing to do with the crime, according to a statement released by Ware.\nWare previously told 6 Investigates that the DA's office did not have any physical evidence linking Padron to these crimes, instead, it used testimony from a witness who changed his story after prosecutors offered him a plea deal on a separate case.\nThere are laws in place that limit the scope of testimony from witnesses such as these. Those same laws require the prosecution to inform the jury of any deals made to secure testimony.\nThese laws were not in place during Padron's trial in 2004.\n\"Unfortunately none of those laws were in place back in 2004 when this took place but there are a number of laws now in place that, that kind of evidence wouldn't have been allowed today,\" Ware said.\nWe are innocent until proven guilty, our prosecutors are not supposed to cheat, we're not supposed to re-write testimony, we are not supposed to say hey going to give you this deal if you change the truth.\nIn September 2023, James Sales, the original prosecutor on the case, said he believed Padron was guilty and said it has always been his practice as a prosecutor to disclose any plea agreement made during witness testimony.\nPadron, who maintained his innocence throughout his imprisonment, expressed relief and concern for the victims' families. \"I feel excited and relieved. I'm glad that justice has prevailed,\" he said. \"The families of the victims deserve to know the truth. They have been forgotten in all of this.\"\nThe Innocence Project of Texas, which has now exonerated or freed forty people since 2006, played a crucial role in Padron's case. Padron also credited his original post-conviction attorney, Danice Obregon, for her persistent efforts.",

    "text": "Walking in a winter wonderland may sound serene and peaceful, however, shoveling your sidewalks to take that walk could quickly change delightful to deadly. According to the American Heart Association, the world's leading nonprofit organization focused on heart and brain health for all, research shows that the exertion of shoveling snow may lead to an increased risk of a [heart attack](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack) or [sudden cardiac arrest](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-arrest).\nThe American Heart Association's 2020 scientific statement, [Exercise-Related Acute Cardiovascular Events and Potential Deleterious Adaptations Following Long-Term Exercise Training: Placing the Risks Into Perspective–An Update](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epub/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000749), notes snow shoveling among the physical activities that may place extra stress on the heart, especially among people who aren't used to regular exercise. Numerous scientific research studies over the years have identified the dangers of shoveling snow for people with and without known heart disease.\n\"Research has found that the strain of heavy snow shoveling may be as demanding on the heart than taking a treadmill stress test. Combined with the dangers of exertion in extremely cold weather, you're looking at a perfect storm for a heart-related event,\" said Keith Churchwell, M.D., FAHA, American Heart Association volunteer president and an associate clinical Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut and adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee. \"The impact can be worse on those people who are the least fit.\"\nChurchwell noted several ways snow shoveling affects heart health:\n- The act of shoveling snow is mostly arm work, which is more taxing and demanding on the heart than leg work.\n- While straining to lift heavy loads, such a shovelful of snow, you often unconsciously hold your breath, which causes big increases in heart rate and blood pressure.\n- Exposure to cold air causes constriction of blood vessels throughout the body, disproportionately raising blood pressure and simultaneously constricting the coronary arteries.\n\"The movements of snow shoveling are very taxing and demanding on your body and can cause significant increases in your heart rate and blood pressure,\" Churchwell said. \"Combined with the fact that the exposure to cold air can constrict blood vessels throughout the body, you're asking your heart to do a lot more work in conditions that are already diminishing the heart's ability to function at its best.\"\nChurchwell cautioned that the impact of snow removal is especially concerning for people who already have cardiovascular risks like a sedentary lifestyle or obesity, being a current or former smoker, having diabetes, high cholesterol or high blood pressure, as well as people who have had a heart attack or stroke.\n\"People with these characteristics and those who have had bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty simply should not be shoveling snow in any conditions,\" he said. \"We often see events in people who are usually sedentary, they work at a computer all day or get little or no exercise. Then once or twice a year they go out and try to shovel the driveway after a heavy snowfall and that unexpected exertion can unfortunately lead to tragedy.\"\nChurchwell recommends the following tips to reduce increased risk from snow shoveling:\n- If you have known or suspected heart disease or risk factors for heart disease, get someone else to do your snow removal for you!\n- If you must shovel the snow, start gradually and pace yourself. Always cover your mouth and nose, wear layered clothing, as well as a hat and gloves.\n- Ideally, push or sweep the snow rather than lifting and throwing it, that action involves a little less exertion.\n- Be extra careful when the wind is blowing, the wind makes the temperature feel even colder than it is and will increase the effects of the cold on your body.\n- If you are able, use an automated snow blower rather than shoveling. While you should still proceed with caution and be mindful of how your body is feeling, research shows that using a snow blower doesn't raise your heart rate quite as high as shoveling.\nThe American Heart Association urges everyone to learn the [common signs of a heart attack and stroke](https://www.heart.org/en/about-us/heart-attack-and-stroke-symptoms). If you experience chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or heart palpitations or irregular heart rhythms, stop the activity immediately. Call 9-1-1 if symptoms don't subside shortly after you stop shoveling or snow blowing. If you see someone collapse while shoveling snow, call for help and start [Hands-Only CPR](https://cpr.heart.org/en/cpr-courses-and-kits/hands-only-cpr) if they are unresponsive with no pulse.\nLearn more about cold weather and cardiovascular disease [heart.org](http://www.heart.org/).\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/snowstorm-alert-stay-heart-healthy-in-cold-1386152/).",

    "title": "Gabriela Wiener: \\\"Quiero que España pida perdón para no tener que dar más titulares diciendo: España, pide perdón, por Dios\\\"",
    "text": "Tres años después del éxito de Huaco retrato, el libro con el que quedó finalista del Booker Prize Internacional y el PEN América, la escritora peruana residente en Madrid Gabriela Wiener regresa con la novela Atusparia. Una historia de iniciación protagonizada por una mujer que vive en sus carnes la deriva política de su país desde el lado político de la izquierda. Una posición que requiere grandes dosis de romanticismo y valentía, sobre todo si se abraza la causa más difícil de todas: la de quienes han sufrido durante siglos sin que nadie se acuerde siquiera de sus nombres. Atusparia viene de Pedro Pablo Atusparia, un dirigente indígena que lideró la Rebelión de Huaraz en 1885, cuando los campesinos tomaron las armas para luchar contra el restablecimiento del impuesto indígena durante la crisis de la posguerra en el Pacífico. Su espíritu está presente durante todo el transcurrir del relato: así se llama el colegio donde estudia la protagonista y será su nombre de militante durante su carrera política, truncada por el lawfare de un sistema que consigue llevarla a la cárcel. Y no a una cualquiera, sino a un penal al aire libre del que, paradójicamente, parece imposible fugarse. Aunque comparte muchas cosas con su personaje principal –desde la poderosa melena negra hasta el centro educativo– en esta ocasión no hay autobiografía en su escritura. “Como en cualquier ficción, hay cosas que pasaron en mi vida y cosas históricas, por supuesto, cosas del presente del Perú. Pero está todo pasado por la ficción. Es una historia de la izquierda latinoamericana, pero podría ser de la izquierda española o europea”, explica con esta entrevista para elDiario.es que tiene lugar en Barcelona. ¿De dónde sale Atusparia? ¿Qué le impulsa a escribirla? Por un lado, de un viaje que hice a Puno (Perú) como periodista, en el que fui a cubrir para una revista una historia de levantamiento campesino. Creo que esto lo ligué un poco a la memoria de mi escuela real que se llamaba Atusparia. Era algo que había dejado como una pequeña información colada en algún libro, pero que nunca había desarrollado y que tenía ganas de escribir. Y luego fueron apareciendo otras cosas como, por ejemplo, unas fotografías de las ciudades soviéticas abandonadas después de la caída del muro que me recordaron a la residencial donde yo había vivido en mi adolescencia. Además, también me vino de un documental de esa cárcel que originalmente estaba al aire. Todo eso me permitió contar la educación sentimental y política de una mujer, de un personaje. La novela está dividida en las diferentes fases de la vida de la protagonista, que están marcadas por las luchas por el poder o por quién lleva la razón dentro del movimiento político de la izquierda. Por supuesto, en el libro están las luchas intestinas de la izquierda, sus conflictos, sobre cuál debe ser la dirección política o qué nivel de radicalidad hay. Entre unas y otras tratando de medir su pureza ideológica, su intachabilidad. Son esos grandes temas que ocurren en el seno de los movimientos emancipatorios y que a veces son su perdición. Todo esto de exacerbar las contradicciones, tan del marxismo, termina a veces siendo una trampa. Pero también está todo lo que ocurre fuera de los movimientos, más allá de las izquierdas. Cómo se persigue cualquier iniciativa transformadora. Llámala bloqueo, llámala patio trasero de Estados Unidos, llámalo lawfare o judicialización de la política o acoso a las mujeres políticas. Cosas que hemos visto aquí, en España, todo el tiempo. Hay unas fuerzas muy poderosas que no quieren que esos movimientos y esos liderazgos lleguen al poder. Ni que, por supuesto, una revolución tenga una continuidad para cambiar las estructuras. La traición es un tema central de Atusparia. Todos la sienten pero también la ejecutan. Creo en la traición cuando tiene una buena base, un buen fundamento. En algunos momentos puedes ver traición o puedes ver justicia, a veces se pueden confundir. Es un tema muy literario porque concentra, un dolor originario que no siempre se comprende y que empuja a la acción. Entonces eso hace que el héroe o el personaje tenga varias dimensiones. Ese lado oscuro siempre da mucho juego para la escritura y más si, como en este caso, se trata de entender cómo nuestra práctica política está atravesada de lo sentimental, de lo afectivo, de lo amoroso, de lo relacional, de lo sexual. Ese es un tema que me obsesiona, pero pocas veces se habla de todo lo que está detrás de las grandes decisiones políticas que hacen que la humanidad vaya para un lado o vaya para el otro. Yo digo que el libro trata sobre la traición política como una traición amorosa y la traición amorosa como una traición política. Ya no sabes dónde empieza y dónde termina cada cosa. Si todo lo personal es político, todo lo político es personal ¿no? Todo lo político es pasional. Hay un colectivo que tiene que luchar dos veces, por proletario y, a la vez, por indígena. En la novela hay una cita de Manuel Scorza que es esencial para entender la historia: “En los Andes hay cinco estaciones: primavera, verano, otoño, invierno y masacre”. Yo soy hija de esa izquierda que optó por el camino político [y no de las armas] y que ahora mismo es una izquierda casi arrinconada en mi país, sin posibilidad de acción. Yo bebí marxismo desde niña, yo vi pasar a ese proletariado obrero en mi infancia. Pero en el libro hablo de José Carlos Mariátegui, que dijo que esa utopía del socialismo que se pensaba realizar en un territorio como el Perú o cualquiera de Latinoamérica no podía ser un calco y copia de la Revolución Rusa. En un país tan andino, el proletariado eran los indígenas y el campesinado. Siempre he sentido que es el colectivo que queda más abandonado en las memorias políticas, porque puedes saber con nombre y apellido la gente que fue desaparecida en Chile o Argentina, pero no sabes nada sobre las revoluciones indígenas, que tienen una historia de muchos años atrás. Yo le quería rendir tributo porque es un movimiento que sigue activo y que me tocó ver en persona, lo hemos visto todos, porque han sido los que han puesto el cuerpo desde que Dina Boluarte cogobierna con la policía. ¿Por qué no ocupa más portadas de periódicos la actualidad de Perú? Hay paros, manifestaciones y la presidenta tiene unos índices de aprobación muy bajos. Entre otros problemas graves. Se llama racismo. Laura Richardson, jefa del Comando Sur de Estados Unidos, nos llamó ‘alacena’. Se refiere a la Amazonía, a los bosques, a las montañas, al agua. Saben perfectamente que si tienen que hacer una guerra o una nueva masacre, no va a haber ningún problema. Un indio nunca va a ser un obstáculo para construir otra mina. En Atusparia se deja ver ese racismo estructural y también el machismo ejercido por los propios compañeros revolucionarios de las militantes o por el sistema político, que solo tiene que utilizar un vídeo antiguo para quitarse de en medio a una candidata con posibilidades de gobernar. Me acuerdo de un documental que hicieron en Perú sobre la izquierda, en el que había muy pocas mujeres entrevistadas. Mi mamá era sindicalista y había estado militando con mujeres desde muchos lugares pero no están en el relato oficial. Ahora mismo en las primeras líneas de lucha siempre hay mujeres, en última instancia son las que toman las decisiones y una vez más, estas cosas no se cuentan. Por eso yo quería hacer un libro donde todas las protagonistas son mujeres y disidentes sexuales. Pero las buenas y las malas están encarnadas, no son víctimas ni villanas. Simplemente están en acción en el mundo y, en muchos casos, puede que haya decisiones o comportamientos de ellas que te parezcan asquerosos. No es un libro para celebrar la feminidad en lo absoluto, sino que tiene personajes de carne y hueso, simplemente. ¿Qué opina sobre que España deba pedir perdón a América Latina por el expolio y los crímenes que perpetró durante la colonización? El tema volvió a la actualidad hace unos días por la petición de la presidenta de México Claudia Sheinbaum, pero es recurrente. Cuando publiqué Huaco retrato todos los titulares de las entrevistas que me hicieron eran sobre eso. Ahora yo solamente quiero que España pida perdón ya para que yo no tenga que dar un solo titular más diciendo “España, pide perdón, por Dios”. [ríe] Es importante que estos gestos simbólicos existan. Es algo de sentido común: cuando tú le haces daño a alguien, aunque hayan pasado diez, 20 o 500 años, le pides perdón. Es de justicia restaurativa. Ni siquiera te ha cancelado, no te ha hecho el escrache, solo te ha dicho que pidas perdón. Pero claro, si dices que no, pues normal que no te inviten a la fiesta. En el libro dice: “En el colegio nos enseñaban que la historia solo les da la razón a los heroicos de los románticos”. ¿Acabará siendo así? Esta es una historia de los vencidos y esperemos que la tortilla dé la vuelta. La última vez que hubo un cambio realmente estructural fue con la Revolución Rusa. Y luego se cayó en la tentación autoritaria. Es difícil porque cualquier iniciativa que no sea la del consumo y la del ultracapitalismo siempre será aislada y siempre se tratará de neutralizar. Ahora mismo la izquierda mundial está en un momento defensivo, en un lugar como de repliegue. El libro apuesta por volver a las utopías, a reenamorarnos de las nociones revolucionarias que nos pueden sacar de este estado tan paralizante, aunque por otro lado tan comprensible por la ofensiva ultraderechista. El debate de cómo lo vamos a hacer mejor está abierto. Por eso quería escribir Atusparia, porque veo que hay un bloqueo terrible en los movimientos y luego está la imposibilidad de dar una dirección política después de los estallidos. Mira lo que pasó en Chile que, desde el estallido al proceso constituyente, algo se rompió. Cuándo nos vamos a atrever a ser una izquierda verdaderamente revolucionaria y evitar que ese vórtice del centro te coma y que ahí quede todo. Hay ganas de que la izquierda blanca europea le pare los pies al fascismo, no solo con pañuelos o símbolos sino desde las instituciones cuando están en ellas.",
