    "text": "Omar Jabbour ‘00 Guides The Next Generation\nAs a third-year USF Law student, Omar Jabbour ‘00 gained real-world, hands-on experience in USF’s Criminal Law Clinic. He says that working alongside practicing attorneys was transformative because “I got to ask questions and watch the lawyers ‘in real time’”. Today, as the chief legal officer and chief compliance officer at Astound Digital, a digital commerce solutions provider, Jabbour supports aspiring lawyers by hiring USF Law students for extern and intern positions.\nJabbour emphasizes that the externship experience is mutually beneficial. As a business, Jabbour says his company benefits from students’ fresh ideas, passion for the law, and energy. “We ask our student externs difficult questions. It's amazing to see them take an idea and develop it on their own.” At Astound, students work on a variety of projects, including drafting memoranda and conducting presentations at the culmination of their externships. “We get to see how they start and watch their evolution over time. It’s great to see their confidence grow.”\nJabbour’s own professional journey began at the height of the Bay Area’s tech boom. After graduating from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in rhetoric, he was uncertain about his next steps. With an interest in both law and technology, he enrolled in USF Law and says the decision was both “purposeful and exciting.”\nThe first in his family to graduate from law school, Jabbour dove into the legal deep end immediately after earning his degree. He worked as a solo general counsel with a small e-commerce firm, shouldering all legal responsibilities without the budget to hire external counsel. “The learning curve was steep at first”, he says, but it also offered invaluable opportunities to gain experience across different areas of practice. Since then, his career (entirely in-house) has spanned transactional, civil litigation, employment advisory, and other areas. Today, Jabbour oversees the legal function at Astound Digital, working alongside a global team and operating at the intersection of technology and law.\nThroughout his two decades as an attorney, Jabbour has maintained a close connection to USF Law, particularly with the Externships Program. His dedication to mentoring future attorneys is rooted in a desire to provide students with real-world experiences that will shape their careers. “Externships allow students not only to hone their legal skills but also to explore different areas of law, helping them decide which path is right for them.”\nMeghan Gleeson ‘23 worked as an extern with Jabbour during her third year of law school. She says the experience gave her a chance to not only put theory into practice but also to “make mistakes and grow from them.” It helped to have a supportive mentor,” she adds, “Omar surrounds himself with legal colleagues who love to practice law, are highly competent, and share the willingness and passion to teach. Being a part of Omar's team and benefiting from his guidance was an invaluable experience.”",

    "text": "WASHINGTON: American forces carried out strikes in Yemen against 10 attack drones and a ground control station belonging to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the US military said Wednesday.\nA US warship also shot down an anti-ship missile fired by the Houthis and later downed three Iranian drones, Central Command (CENTCOM) said.\nWhile the United States has recently launched strikes on the Houthis and other Tehran-supported groups in the region, both it and Iran have sought to avoid a direct confrontation, and the downing of three Iranian drones could heighten tensions.\nEarly on Thursday local time, US forces targeted a “Houthi UAV ground control station and 10 Houthi one-way UAVs” that “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region,” CENTCOM said in a statement, using an abbreviation for unmanned aerial vehicle.\nCENTCOM earlier announced that the USS Carney had shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Houthis, and then downed three Iranian drones less than an hour later. It did not specify if the drones shot down by the naval destroyer were designed for attack or surveillance.\nAmerican forces also destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile on Wednesday that CENTCOM said posed an imminent threat to “US aircraft” — a deviation from past air raids that focused on reducing the rebels’ ability to threaten international shipping.\nIt did not identify the type of aircraft that were threatened or the exact location of the strike, only saying that it took place in “Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.”\nThe Houthis began targeting Red Sea shipping in November, saying they were hitting Israeli-linked vessels in support of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been ravaged by the Israel-Hamas war.\nUS and UK forces have responded with strikes on the Houthis, who have since declared American and British interests to be legitimate targets as well.\nSome of the US strikes have been carried out against missiles that CENTCOM has said posed an imminent threat to ships, indicating a robust surveillance effort focused on Houthi-controlled territory that likely involves military aircraft.\nThe United States also set up a multinational naval task force to help protect Red Sea shipping from the Houthis’ repeated attacks on the transit route, which carries up to 12 percent of global trade.\nIn addition to military action, Washington has sought to put diplomatic and financial pressure on the Houthis, redesignating them as a terrorist organization earlier in January after previously having dropped that label soon after President Joe Biden took office.\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40287000/hike-in-146-drug-prices-allowed\">Hike in 146 drug prices allowed\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286950/us-strikes-10-houthi-drones-downs-unmanned-iranian-aircraft\">US strikes 10 Houthi drones, downs unmanned Iranian aircraft\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286999/industrial-tariff-revision-parleys-with-imf-in-a-day-or-two\">Industrial tariff revision: Parleys with IMF in a day or two\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286998/cdwp-clears-four-projects-worth-rs13866bn\">CDWP clears four projects worth Rs138.66bn\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286997/transition-from-libor-to-sofr-approved-ecc-decides-to-provide-subsidy-on-wheat-to-g-b\">Transition from Libor to ‘SOFR’ approved: ECC decides to provide subsidy on wheat to G-B\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286994/telecom-sector-fbr-launches-single-sales-tax-return\">Telecom sector: FBR launches single sales tax return\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286992/karot-hydropower-project-chinese-firm-concerned-at-curbs-on-its-staffs-movement\">Karot hydropower project: Chinese firm concerned at curbs on its staff’s movement\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286991/engagement-with-ipps-ccoe-directs-pd-to-initiate-separate-case\">Engagement with IPPs: CCoE directs PD to initiate separate case\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286988/senate-panel-approves-ban-on-export-of-minerals\">Senate panel approves ban on export of minerals\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286979/returns-filed-on-jan-01-ktba-urges-fbr-to-include-corporate-taxpayers-in-atl-2024\">Returns filed on Jan 01: KTBA urges FBR to include corporate taxpayers in ATL 2024\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286987/countrys-foreign-missions-communication-systems-safe-protected-fo\">Country’s foreign missions: Communication systems safe, protected: FO\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40286982/bilawal-moves-into-top-gear-as-election-nears\">Bilawal moves into top gear as election nears\n</a>\nRead more stories Next Story",

    "text": "ROCHESTER, Wash. — Ever wonder here baby Christmas Trees come from? Every year, 45 million trees get their start at\nWeyerhaeuser's Rochester Tree Nursery. About 5 million of these are future Christmas Trees.\nAuriel Day, nursery site leader, explains the 'Fir Tree Facts of Life' as she shows us one of the fir seed orchards on this site.\n\"This orchard is one of our newer established ones, it's seven years old, we expect a cone crop hopefully within the next five years,\" she said.\nTrees make both male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, then female cones make seeds. Then workers at the nursery harvest the cones by hand.\n\"Those cones get collected into bushel bags and sent to our seed processing plant where a lot of steps go into getting down to that little seed, to produce millions of Christmas trees,\" Day said.\nEach seed gets shaken and sorted in a contraption that gets rid of excess material and chaff. \"Pure live seed is what we're looking for,\" explained seed plant manager Viviana Olivares holding a handful of seeds - future trees.\nThen the seeds get a nice, long bath. \"They go through a water bath for 24 hours then they're removed and taken out to a cooler, this is important for germination,\" Olivares explained\nDay pointed out one jug full of soaking seeds: \"Here we have noble fir seed, in about 10 years you'll have your Christmas tree to take home and enjoy in the comfort of your living room.\"\nThe seeds are nurtured into tiny trees at the nursery. And they aren't just destined for your living room.\n\"This is a one year Douglas fir seedling,\" said Day, holding a 7 inch tall light green seedling. \"We'll ship it out this year and it will be in it's forever home when it wakes up.\"\nMore than 130 million seedlings a year get planted in the wild - reforestation to replace trees that have been harvested. Part of the Pacific Northwest's circle of life, whether these little green babies grow up to be Christmas trees - or future forests.\n\"I love what I do coming in and you just you feel like you have this bigger purpose.\" said Day. \"Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I just feel like I took a lot of it for granted for a long time. And now I get to be part of making sure that we have forests for generations to come.\"\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",

Ils délivrent des permis et s’occupent de la planification de chantiers.\nLe président de l’APIGQ maintient que Québec n’offre pas véritablement aux ingénieurs du gouvernement la même «enveloppe budgétaire» que celle qu’il a accordée à l’ensemble des employés de l’État.\nLa présidente du Conseil du trésor, Sonia LeBel, assure que le gouvernement a bel et bien offert aux ingénieurs des augmentations de salaire de l’ordre de 17,4 % sur cinq ans, comme ce qui a été accordé aux autres employés de l’État.\n«Une proposition globale de règlement, incluant le +17,4 % tel que convenu avec 98 % des autres syndicats publics, a été déposée le 8 janvier 2025», a-t-elle indiqué.\nM. Martin rétorque qu’en plus des augmentations salariales de 17,4 %, les employés de l’État ont obtenu un autre montant, qui équivaut selon lui à 7 ou 8 %, pour les assurances, des congés, des primes et autres – ce qui n’a pas été offert aux ingénieurs.\nIl rapporte donc que ses membres «ont le sentiment que le gouvernement s’obstine à nous donner moins que les autres».",

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra might be pricier than its predecessor, here’s why",
    "text": "As the season of flagship Androids has begun, most eyes are on the South Korean tech giant Samsung and its upcoming flagship S25 series. As you may know, the Galaxy S25 series can include four phones: vanilla S25, S25+, a new S25 Slim, and the top-end S25 Ultra. The last one is the most anticipated smartphone, but it can also be pricier compared to its previous generation counterpart.\nAs per tipster SetsunaDigital, this time the production cost or the Bill of Materials (BOM) of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is higher. It may be $110 (approximately Rs 9,200) higher than the current Galaxy S24 Ultra. Since the production cost is higher, its retail cost can also go up for the customers, especially for those outside China. In China, Samsung can maintain the current prices.\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is presently priced at Rs 1,29,999 in India. With a price hike, the Galaxy S25 Ultra can come closer to the price range of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is for Rs 1,49,900. But the issue is that things aren’t clear yet. While some reports suggest that only the prices of the S25 Ultra will go up, others suggest that the entire lineup might retain the prices.\nReports suggest that Samsung can price the Galaxy S25 Ultra base model at $1,299, the S25+ at $999, and the standard Galaxy S25 at $799. Apple’s decision to retain the pricing of the iPhone 16 lineup could influence Samsung to do the same in markets like India and the US.\nPreviously we saw in India that Samsung adjusted Galaxy S24 Ultra prices after the iPhone 16 Pro launched with a competitive price tag of Rs 1,19,900. So let’s see how it goes with the Galaxy S25 Ultra to compete with Apple and to prevent users from switching.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Astrología y horóscopo, ¿la ciencia de los \"imbéciles\"? - Digital Trends Español",
    "text": "“La astrología es la ‘ciencia’ por la que un imbécil llega a creer que es imbécil por culpa de las estrellas”. Así resumía el escritor y humorista español El Perich la creencia popular de los horóscopos, aquellos pronósticos llenos de misticismo que anticipan el devenir de nuestro destino y que, en pleno siglo XXI, siguen figurando entre lo más consultado en internet. Pero, ¿qué dice la ciencia sobre los horóscopos y por tanto, la astrología? ¿Hay algún sustento científico para creer que Mercurio retrógrado hará de nuestros días una crisis insufrible? ¿O son, ni más ni menos, pura charlatanería?\nLo cierto es que, si bien no existe ningún sustento científico para señalar que el carácter y la fortuna (o desfortuna) de una persona estará regida por las constelaciones, los horóscopos sí influyen en quienes creen en ellos y su efecto sí está sustentado en una ciencia que definitivamente no es la astronomía, sino una más terrestre: la psicología .\nRecommended Videos Leer el horóscopo y sentirse identificado no es obra de un misticismo astral, sino de un efecto psicológico de concordancia de la personalidad conocido como efecto Forer , llamado así en honor al psicólogo estadounidense Bertram R. Forer. En 1948, Forer realizó un experimento que consistió en aplicar un test de personalidad basado en generalidades tomadas de horóscopos de periódicos a un grupo de estudiantes, y con los que, sorpresa, varios de ellos mostraron alguna afinidad.\nRelated A los científicos no les gustan los emojis de la naturaleza Black Friday: su historia y evolución a lo largo de los años La ciencia dice quién eres a partir de cómo echas mantequilla al pan La psicóloga Carmen Almendros de la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid lo resume sin muchos rodeos: “A la gente le gusta recibir información sobre sí misma, especialmente si contiene descripciones favorables”.\nOtra ciencia que abona sobre la utilidad de los horóscopos es la sociología y su concepto de profecía autocumplida . Descrita por el sociólogo estadounidense Robert K. Merton, la profecía autocumplida es a grandes rasgos el hecho de que las creencias respecto de algo, aunque no sean reales, determinan nuestro comportamiento y lo guían.\nSobra decir que la astronomía, que es el estudio científico de los cuerpos celestes, no ha validado y muy seguramente jamás dé crédito a las tesis de la astrología, que estudia la influencia de los astros sobre el destino de las personas. Hasta ahora, científicamente se ha comprobado que la única fuerza que ejercen los astros sobre nosotros es la gravitatoria y es tan fuerte que probablemente algún día termine con nuestra existencia .\nImagen utilizada con permiso del titular de los derechos de autor ¿Por qué la astrología astronómicamente no tiene sentido? La astronomía occidental sugiere que la personalidad está regidas por los 12 signos tradicionales de la mitología antigua: Aries, Tauro, Géminis, Cáncer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Escorpio, Sagitario, Capricornio, Acuario y Piscis.\nEsta creencia apunta que el firmamento está dividido en 12 pedazos iguales que dan como resultado las divisiones del zodiaco. Sin embargo, este supuesto se basa en que las constelaciones tienen las mismas dimensiones y esto no es preciso. Por ejemplo, mientras la constelación de tauro abarca 797.2 grados cuadrados, la de géminis abarca 513.8.\nDebido a esto, si el zodiaco tuviera en cuenta los tamaños de las constelaciones, los signos que rigen nuestro destino tendrían una duración diferente de días y no estarían divididas en 12 proporciones iguales a lo largo del año.\nA este factor también se suma el desplazamiento del eje de la Tierra, que según el astrónomo de la Universidad de Illinois James Kaler al cabo de 3,000 años todo el zodiaco deberá desplazarse un signo completo.\nEn concordancia con el tamaño de las constelaciones y la traslación alrededor del Sol, las fechas correctas de los signos zodiacales serían muy distintas a las usadas por los horóscopos. Kaler propone estas fechas :\nAries: del 19 de abril al 14 de mayo Tauro: del 15 de mayo al 20 de junio Géminis: del 21 de junio al 20 de julio Cáncer: del 21 de julio al 10 de agosto Leo: del 11 de agosto al 16 de septiembre Virgo: del 17 de septiembre al 31 de octubre Libra: del 1 al 24 de noviembre Escorpio: del 25 de noviembre al 17 de diciembre Sagitario: del 18 de diciembre al 19 de enero Capricornio: del 20 de enero al 16 de febrero Acuario: del 17 de febrero al 11 de marzo Piscis: del 12 de marzo al 18 de abril Tampoco hay que perder de vista que no hay un solo horóscopo y ni en la astrología occidental hay consensos. Botón de esto es un estudio realizado en 1978 en el que se revisaron los horóscopos de 14 escuelas astrológicas de San Francisco (Estados Unidos) en los que se encontraron 2,375 adjetivos, de los cuales, solo 30 eran citados por dos o más escuelas.\nEn tanto, en lo que cabe al horóscopo chino —regido por el calendario lunar y no el gregoriano—, las divisiones entre los signos (rata, buey, tigre, conejo, dragón, serpiente, caballo, borrego, mono, gallo, perro y cerdo) se asignan según los años.\nEn suma, estas tradiciones antiguas se explican en nuestra intrínseca necesidad de conocer el futuro y que, dados sus orígenes hace 4,000 años en las cultura de Mesopotamia, Babilonia y Asiria, hoy no deberían de ser algo más que anecdótico.\nRecomendaciones del editor La ciencia explica por qué las luces de navidad siempre se enredan Echa un vistazo al diseño de la nueva y llamativa sede de Tencent Islandia: los videos de la tierra rompiéndose en espera de una gran erupción El truco de los vuelos baratos en Google que la rompe La ciencia revela el secreto tóxico detrás de la Mona Lisa",

Some biologists and groups argue the recovery plan should establish three distinct populations, including an area north of the Grand Canyon.",
