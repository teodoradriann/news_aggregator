    "title": "What went right this week: the good news that matters - Positive News - Positive News",
    "text": "England set a biodiversity benchmark, the ‘most democratic country’ was revealed, and Belgium championed the rights of single people, plus more good news This week’s good news roundup In a world first, England has introduced legislation requiring all new developments to boost nature. The biodiversity net gain law came into force on Tuesday. It means that if habitats are destroyed for homes, roads, or other developments, equivalent habitats must be recreated on-site or elsewhere. The new habitats must also deliver a 10% biodiversity gain, rather than simply replacing what has been lost. It remains to be seen how the government will monitor and enforce the law. However, the Royal Institute of British Architects said it represents a “major change” for architects, who would now have to “design with nature”. Scotland, Sweden and Singapore are among the nations reportedly set to follow England’s example. The Wildlife Trusts, a conservation charity, said the law could “make a positive contribution towards nature’s recovery and help address the climate emergency”. However, its planning and development manager, Rachel Hackett, said the legislation lacked ambition. “A gain of 10% will at best hold the tide against nature loss,” she said. “If we want to secure real recovery for nature, we need to see at least 20% gain.” Image: TimHill A record fall in coal and gas burning left the EU with a cleaner electricity mix than ever in 2023. That’s according to [a report](https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2024/#supporting-material) by the thinktank Ember. Published this week, it revealed a 26% decline in coal power generation and a 15% fall in gas generation in the bloc in 2023. Meanwhile, renewables, Ember said, accounted for a record 44% of the EU’s electricity mix. This chimes with a separate recent report, which suggested [EU emissions had fallen to levels not seen since the 1960s](https://www.positive.news/society/good-news-stories-from-week-5-of-2024/). “The EU’s power sector is in the middle of a monumental shift,” said Sarah Brown, Europe programme director for Ember. “Fossil fuels are playing a smaller role than ever as a system with wind and solar as its backbone comes into view. “However, it is not time to get complacent. The EU needs a laser focus on rapidly deploying wind, solar and flexibility to create a system free of fossil fuels.” Image: MariaGodfrida Flooded coal mines in the west of England are being mooted as a potential source of green energy. A project has just launched to explore whether the water inside the mines could be pumped up and used to heat thousands of homes that sit above them. Mine water is naturally warm and could easily be brought up to a usable temperature by heat pumps, before being distributed via heat networks. Gateshead, in the north of England, is already doing this with its old mines. Now, a £1.6m research project aims to see if the idea could be copied in the west of England. Regional mayor Dan Norris said: “[It’s] fantastic that mines that contributed to CO2 emissions could now hold the key to clean, green energy.” Image: Napa74/iStock Norway has retained its status as the world’s most democratic country in the latest edition of the Democracy Index. Compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the report offered some glimmers of good news despite recording a decline in democracy globally. The number of democratic countries increased by two, to 74, in 2023, as Paraguay and Papua New Guinea moved from ‘hybrid regimes’ to ‘flawed democracies’. However, overall, the global average score fell from 5.29 in 2022 to 5.23 in 2023. “This is in keeping with a general trend of regression and stagnation in recent years and marks a new low since the index began in 2006,” said the EIU. Western Europe was the only region to record improvements in democracy, although they were marginal (0.01 points). Joining Norway in the top ten were, in order: New Zealand, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland, The Netherlands and Taiwan. The UK ranked 19th and the US, considered a ‘flawed democracy’, came in 29th. Image: Arvid Malde Efforts to defeat Alzheimer’s [have taken major steps forward recently](https://www.positive.news/society/welcome-to-the-golden-age-of-medicine/), with breakthrough treatments found to slow the condition. Now a new front against the disease appears to be opening up, after scientists identified blood proteins that indicate whether a person could develop the condition. A recent study showed that [a simple blood test gives up to 15 years advance warning of a person developing Alzheimer’s](https://www.positive.news/society/good-news-stories-from-week-4-of-2024/). Separate research, published this week, added to the evidence. It identified 11 blood biomarkers that researchers claim are 90% accurate at predicting whether a person will be affected by dementia. Improving diagnosis is vital with the arrival of new therapies. The [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00565-0) was conducted by scientists from the University of Warwick in England, and Fudan University in China, who described their findings as a “breakthrough”. Image: Teona Swift The crane population in the UK is the highest it’s been in more than 400 years, according to the latest headcount of the birds. Survey results from 2023 suggest there are now more than 250 common cranes stalking UK waterways, including a record 80 breeding pairs. While some cultures once worshipped them as gods, in the UK they were wiped out by hunters in the 16th century, before returning under their own steam in the 1970s. According to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, 80% of the breeding population reside on protected sites, including restored wetlands. “The conservation and protection of UK wetlands is helping our crane population go from strength to strength,” said Damon Bridge, chair of the UK Crane Working Group. “But that’s only part of the story. Wetlands support countless other magnificent species, lock away carbon… and can hold back water to help reduce the impact of flooding.” He added: “We need to build on this foundation by safeguarding protected sites and creating larger, better-connected wetland areas.” Image: Andy Morffew A French car scheme that subsidises low earners to lease electric vehicles has been scaled up due to huge demand. The programme enables people who drive for work and earn less than €15,400 (£12,850) annually to lease an electric vehicle for €100-150 (£85-£128) per month. The government initially offered 20,000 leases this year but has upped that to 50,000 due to demand. The scheme will now be paused until next year so that carmakers can produce more vehicles. Only cars made in the EU are covered by the programme, described by the French government as a “real success story”, despite having to be paused. The switch to electric vehicles is vital to reduce transport emissions. However, they come with their own environmental issues, [which firms are racing to address](https://www.positive.news/environment/electric-vehicles-have-a-dirty-secret-the-race-is-on-to-clean-it-up/). Image: Andrew Roberts Single people are routinely disadvantaged in life, thanks to marriage tax allowances, single supplements for hotels and other such policies. A municipality in Belgium is doing something about it. Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, on the outskirts of Brussels, has agreed to consider the impact of policies on people who live alone. It comes as data suggests that the number of EU households made up of only one adult has risen by 30% in just over a decade. Councillor Carla Dejonghe persuaded her municipality to start viewing policies through the eyes of people who live alone. “It’s a milestone,” Dejonghe, [told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/14/lens-singleton-belgian-council-focus-live-alone). “For the first time, a municipality is committing to examining its policies through the lens of a singleton. Nobody’s ever thought about it.” Image: Anna Shvets The Palestinian para-cyclists known as Gaza Sunbirds were hoping to participate in the Paralympics this year. Instead, they are pedalling through rubble, delivering vital aid to displaced Gazans. This week, Positive News caught up with the riders in Rafah, where some 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have taken shelter, but are now having to flee again as Israeli troops move in. “Delivering aid on our bikes and walking with the help of a crutch is a message that life can go on amidst the waves of despair overwhelming the Palestinians,” said Alaa Al Dali, co-founder of the Sunbirds.

    "text": "Payday ringed on a calendar\nInvestors seeking passive income or those depending on their investments to cover their living expenses could findÂ dividend stocksÂ attractive. Thankfully, the TSX has numerousÂ fundamentally strongÂ income stocks, such asÂ EnbridgeÂ andÂ Fortis, that have been consistently paying and increasing their dividends for decades. Their solid payouts and resilient business model make them attractive passive-income stocks.Â\nHowever, Iâll focus on shares of companies that offer monthly payouts. These stocks boost your monthly income and enhance liquidity. Also, it enables you to reinvest the dividends in stocks, allowing you to accumulate more shares and create wealth over time.Â\nWith this background, letâs look at a top Canadian stock paying monthly dividends.\nThe 7.5% dividend stock offering monthly cash Among the TSX stocks that offer monthly payouts, SmartCentres Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX:SRU.UN) stands out for its solid dividend payment history, high-quality assets, and compelling yield.\nOperating as an integrated REIT (real estate investment trust), SmartCentres distributes a significant portion of its earnings as dividends, making it an attractive choice for investors seeking passive income. Despite maintaining a notably high payout ratio, SmartCentres remains a reliable investment due to its consistent track record of paying dividends and occasionally increasing the same.\nThe REIT currently provides a monthly dividend yield of $0.154 per share, translating to a dividend yield of approximately 7.5% based on its closing price of $24.53 on December 22.\nFactors that make SmartCentres a reliable bet The primary reasons to invest in SmartCentres stock are its stellar dividend payment history and high yield. Further, investors should note that SmartCentres owns resilient real estate assets that consistently generate strong same-properties NOI (net operating income) in all market conditions. This helps SmartCentres cover its payouts easily and consistently enhance its shareholdersâ returns via regular payouts.Â\nAs of September 30, SmartCentres had ownership interests in 191 properties, focusing predominantly on retail properties. These strategically positioned assets, located throughout prime Canadian locations, experience strong demand. Overall, SmartCentres commands total assets of $12 billion and has 35 million square feet of gross leasable mixed-use space.\nWhat supports my bull case is that SmartCentres boasts a high-quality tenant base and remarkably high occupancy rate. This enables SmartCentres to generate stable cash flows to cover its payouts. Investors should note that SmartCentresâs retail portfolio has a 98.5% occupancy rate, which is encouraging. Furthermore, SmartCentres is relatively immune to the high interest rate environment as most of its debt is of fixed rate, enabling the REIT to navigate the interest rate scenario comfortably.Â\nBottom line SmartCentres is an attractive passive income stock offering monthly payouts. Its ability to generate recurring retail income, high occupancy rate, top-quality tenant base, and solid mixed-use properties development program position it well to generate reliable adjusted funds from operation and enhance its shareholdersâ value.\nBased on its current yield of approximately 7.5%, an investment of $10,000 in SmartCentres stock will enable investors to earn $750 /year in passive income.\nShould You Invest $1,000 In SmartCentres REIT?

    "title": "Greyhound Bus Stations Across the Country Close, Forcing Passengers to Wait on the Street",
    "text": "Bus riders in major cities like Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia now have to make do without Greyhound bus stations. So do bus passengers in other American cities where Greyhound stations have shut down in recent years — forcing them to wait on street corners in hard-to-reach areas and raising safety concerns, according to researchers and city officials. There are a variety of reasons behind for the closures. The real estate company that owns the Chicago station is selling the property , according to The Wall Street Journal. Philadelphia’s bus station shut down in June to ease congestion on the bustling Market Street thoroughfare and the downtown location in Columbus, Ohio, was declared a public nuisance . Greyhound did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The future of Greyhound locations in smaller cities remains uncertain. The company has proposed moving its Cleveland station 11 miles away from that city's downtown, according to Axios. Across the state, the Cincinnati bus station shut down after a developer bought the site, which was near the city's center. A study from DePaul University’s Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development earlier this year concluded that the closure of Chicago’s Greyhound station would disproportionately impact low-income travelers, many of whom have no alternative but to travel by bus. “These travelers would suffer if operations shifted to a curbside spot without a secure, climate-controlled waiting room,” the study said. Zach Klein, Columbus' city attorney, sued Greyhound after the bus operator moved the terminal from downtown to an abandoned station on the city’s west side this summer, claiming the new location is a safety hazard. The suit says police calls to the area spiked after it opened , according to the Columbus Dispatch. Kathy Anne Wood, who lives near the new station, told WBNS in Columbus that the station is a safety hazard . \"It puts everybody in danger,” she said. “There's no crosswalks, there's no light. We've had people hit by cars trying to cross the street because they can't get anywhere else.” After Greyhound moved its Tampa, Florida, station to a parking lot earlier this year, riders told WFTS there were no restrooms and no workers to help them with problems or keep them apprised of schedule changes. The coronavirus pandemic decimated the travel industry, and bus companies could not avoid the financial cataclysm. Greyhound reported having around 10,000 passenger journeys per day in fiscal year 2021, compared with 40,000 in the previous year, according to CNBC. Unlike other travel companies, bus companies received comparatively little assistance from COVID relief packages. Only $2 billion of the $54 billion from the CARES Act in 2020 went to bus companies and ferry services, according to the Journal, compared to $4 billion for Amtrak alone. Greyhound was sold to the German company FlixMobility in 2021, which does not release financial information for the bus operator. In the year that ended March 31, 2021, Greyhound recorded $422.6 million in revenue , down 62% from 2009, the Journal reported.",

    "text": "Laureano Benítez Grande-Caballero.- Como cada año, se produce en las conciencias el llamado «síndrome de Jano», quien en la mitología romana era el dios de las puertas, los comienzos, los portales, las transiciones y los finales. Por este motivo, se le consagró el primer mes del año, que recibe de él su nombre, ya que se le representaba con dos cabezas que miraban en direcciones opuestas: una hacia el año que había pasado, y otra hacia el futuro, hacia el año que recién comenzaba.\nEsta mirada hacia el futuro que representa el nuevo año ha originado la costumbre de profetizar sobre el futuro que se abre ante nosotros en los próximos 365 días, elaborando vaticinios y presagios sobre todas las esferas del devenir humano. A esta labor se aplican tanto los videntes, los rappelaramis, los aprendices de brujo, los hierofantes… como los politólogos y economistas, los sociólogos, y etcétera.\nPero, a la hora de volver nuestra cabeza al futuro, las profecías que cuentan con más garantías y credenciales son las que la Virgen revela en sus apariciones, justamente porque son las que siempre se cumplen.\nY en España hemos tenido varias, marcadas por un trágico destino, ya que han sido sistemáticamente anatematizadas, hasta el punto de haber sido perseguidas implacablemente, o haber caído en el olvido más letal.\nY, en estas revelaciones marianas, ocupan un lugar especial las apariciones de Ezquioga, pues tienen una capital importancia a la hora de explicar la revolución frentepopulista que devastará España este trágico año que nos aguarda. Y también a la hora de dar a los españoles un rayo de esperanza frente al apocalipsis que se anuncia.\nEl 30 de junio de 1931, a la hora del ángelus verpertino, en el municipio vasco de Ezquioga, los niños Antonia y Andrés Bereciartua revelaron que la Virgen se les había aparecido. En muy poco tiempo, la noticia se extendió rápidamente, hasta el punto de que se calcula que la campa donde se producían las apariciones tuvo un millón de visitantes en 1931, con un pico de asistentes de 70.000 personas el 16 de julio de 1931.\nLa Virgen aparecía como Mater Dolorosa, con una espada en una mano, y el Rosario en la otra, lo cual se interpretó como el presagio de una guerra, sin que nadie acertara a comprender que el Rosario era la alternativa pacífica a la espada. En otras visiones, la Señora apuntaba con su espada a los cuatro puntos cardinales.\nUna particularidad de estas apariciones es que, además de los videntes, la Virgen también se manifestó a mucha gente, tanto habitantes de Ezquioga, como peregrinos.\nComo suele suceder en estos casos, las apariciones fueron acompañadas de episodios de histerismo, éxtasis, y otros fenómenos más o menos sobrenaturales, en un ambiente de gran fervor religioso. La conmoción fue de tal magnitud, que el mismo Pío Baroja escribió en 1932 su novela Visionarios, la cual fue llevada al cine en 2001 por Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón. Gregorio Marañón fue comisionado por la república para investigar las apariciones, pero, tras conocerlas, declaró su incompetencia para estudiarlas, pues no pertenecían a la dimensión de la medicina.\nComo sucedería más tarde en los años 60 con Garabandal ―aunque en menor medida―, las apariciones sufrieron una implacable persecución por parte de autoridades eclesiásticas y civiles, hasta el punto de que Múgica ―el obispo de Vitoria que había sido represaliado por la república, y que había vuelto a sus diócesis en 1933― prohibió a la niña Benita Aguirre la recepción de los sacramentos, le prohibió que se le apareciera la Virgen, y amenazó de excomunión a sus padres si la niña tenía visiones en casa. El obispo prohibió que los párrocos dieran la comunión a los videntes que tuvieran apariciones y a los laicos que acudieran a la campa. La represión fue tal, que hubo videntes que pasaron por el manicomio. El nacionalismo vasco execró las apariciones, ¡porque María no hablaba en vascuence!\nComo su primera manifestación había tenido lugar a los dos meses de la instauración de la República, tras los salvajes atentados contra instituciones religiosas de mediados del mayo anterior, las apariciones de Ezquioga adquirieron adquirieron enseguida un marcado cariz político, hasta el punto de que se las consideró como parte de una reacción de la derecha contra el triunfo republicano.\nComo es tradicional, en las revelaciones de Ezquioga ―publicadas en un libro del cual tengo una copia― la Virgen hizo unas predicciones sumamente inquietantes referidas al mundo en general, en la misma línea apocalíptica de otras revelaciones recientes, pero con la particularidad de que detalla esas predicciones para España, hasta el punto de que los sucesos que vaticinaba para nuestra Patria constituyen un episodio fundamental del futuro Armageddón, aunque tendrán lugar dentro de un marco más amplio, de escenografía apocalíptica.\nEn efecto, la Virgen transmitió en Ezquioga revelaciones centradas en el futuro de España, tanto del inmediato ―alertando de una futura guerra en España, que fue la Guerra Civil de 1936-1939―, como del más lejano, alertando sobre una amenaza comunista en un futuro más lejano. Ése que ya tenemos precisamente aquí.\nEstas profecías pueden ocasionar en un principio algo de confusión, pues la escala temporal en la que se desarrollan los sucesos predichos puede referirse tanto al período anterior a la Guerra Civil como a la actualidad, pero interpretándolas desde los acontecimientos que se están produciendo en la actualidad, las dudas se disipan sin problema, pues el trasfondo más importante de estas profecías ―obviando el anuncio de una Guerra Civil devastadora que sí se produjo― es el advenimiento en España de una revolución comunista, de breve duración, pero catastrófica: justo la que se está maquinando en estos días por las luciferinas fuerzas del globalismo a quien sirven nuestros nefandos políticos.\nEn efecto, María insistió en que pronto vendrá una persecución muy grande contra los cristianos, teniendo muchos de éstos que huir a los desiertos; que esta persecución vendrá cuando los comunistas se hagan dueños de España, los cuales martirizarán a muchos de aquéllos, aunque el comunismo durará muy pocos días; sin embargo, mientras dure quedarán arruinadas muchas partes de España, a la cual dejarán en completa miseria.\nA simple vista, este vaticinio mariano podría referirse al holocausto católico perpetrado por el Frente Popular; sin embargo, el corolario de la profecía hace entrever claramente que la Virgen no se está refiriendo a los desmanes de la Segunda República, sino de una Tercera, como parece desprenderse de estas palabras: «Muchos creen que cuando haya desaparecido la República española, habrá paz, mas están muy equivocados; la Santísima Virgen nos previene para una lucha mayor».\nDesde este enfoque, después de la desaparición de la Segunda República advino la España de Franco, donde no hubo lucha, ni mayor ni menor ―el maquis no cuadra como protagonista del conflicto anunciado por la Virgen―, así que la contienda que anuncia María debe aplicarse a un futuro más lejano.\nEsta interpretación se refuerza sobremanera en otra profecía mariana sobre el mismo tema: «¡Ay de ti, España! Naciones se reunirán en ti y tus hijos más ilustres serán dispersados. Es seducida España por el mal gobierno. Aquí los pájaros han hecho su nido. La Monarquía está llena de engaños y asechanzas ―esta profecía es de los años 30, en plena Segunda República, luego se está refiriendo a la época actual en que tenemos Monarquía como forma de gobierno―. Las noblezas se han deshecho en vanas palabras. Sólo habrá paz en España mientras Yo reine, por medio del gran Monarca, el Rey de todo el mundo, el rey escogido por Mí».\n«Los pájaros han hecho su nido». ¿A qué se refiere esta metáfora?\nEn mi opinión, a los pajarracos negros del odio, de la cristofobia, de la hispanofobia… los cuervos que nos sacarán los ojos por un tiempo, los milicianos que, salidos de sus madrigueras y sus ataúdes, vuelven con su puño en alto, sedientos de sangre española, de sangre católica.\nEn sus predicciones, la Virgen expone en Ezquioga un certero diagnóstico del aparatoso lavado de cerebro que ha lobotomizado al pueblo español: «La pobre España que palmo a palmo ha sido conquistada por la Cruz se ha convertido en un pueblo de ilotas, que corre al precipicio y lucha por romper sus tradiciones, su historia y su propia manera de ser». Ésta es la causa del triunfo temporal del comunismo cristofóbico en nuestra Patria, producido por la tremenda apostasía de un pueblo que fue regalado por la Providencia por un cúmulo de gracias y bendiciones.\nLas palabras de la Virgen sobre la futura instauración de la Tercera República son contundentes: «Esta República impía que reposa en España, cuya aparición ha sido señal de castigos venideros, pronto será totalmente arruinada; más aún (todavía) vendrán tiempos peores. Los comunistas se apoderarán de España y sacarán fuera de ella a los buenos, y mientras los buenos estéis fuera castigaré cruelmente a toda España sin temer nada…. Y es en este tiempo en el que vendrá el reinado del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús, pero este reinado será interior».\nOtro denominador común de las revelaciones marianas de Ezquioga es que ―como ya hemos señalado― este advenimiento del comunismo en España será breve: «Escuchad, oh pueblos, que habitáis España… Tiempo vendrá en que gozaréis de la verdadera y antigua libertad, pues destruida será la libertad falsa de que se están sirviendo estos impíos. El gobierno tiránico será aniquilado, a pesar de sus terribles esfuerzos, y la verdadera religión florecerá en toda España».\nCinco días durará el comunismo en España, y luego sobrevendrá el Gran Castigo, el cual, según la descripción que da la Virgen, se asemeja mucho a los famosos «Tres Días de Oscuridad» que precederán a La Segunda Venida de Cristo: «Durante el castigo habrá cinco días de comunismo y en tres día caerá fuego y no amanecerá. Que durante estos tres días nadie salga de casa, pues los hombres confundidos empezarán a matarse unos a otros. París será carbonizado, Marsella tragada por el mar, Cataluña tiene sobre sí mucha carga; Madrid, Málaga, San Sebastián y Barcelona, son las que tienen más carga… habrá una enfermedad contagiosa de la que morirá mucha gente… Después reinará Cristo».\nTampoco faltan en estas revelaciones las alusiones a la gran batalla de Los Pirineos, donde la decisiva figura del Caudillo del Tajo vencerá a las fuerzas del mal que quieren destruir e invadir España.\nPodrán creerse o no estas profecías, pero el caso es que los vaticinios sobre la Guerra Civil se cumplieron, y también aquél en el cual anunciaba la aparición de un «ángel» que salvaría a España de la destructora República… ¿Quién fue este «ángel»? Pues ni más ni menos que Francisco Franco, como lo afirmaba sorprendentemente el diario «Público», nada sospechoso de simpatías franquistas: «Entre los mensajes de los visionarios que lo medios recogían sin parar se repetía una clara revelación que resultó increíblemente cierta: “Dentro de cinco años justos se iniciaría una guerra, y que un Ángel Salvador sería el destructor de la República”, con una clara referencia a Francisco Franco».

Cosas veredes.\nEstas profecías sobre el futuro de España, centradas en una revolución comunista, fueron recogidas y precisadas por las apariciones de Garabandal, que estudiaremos en el siguiente artículo.\n(Las apariciones de Ezquioga están recogidas en el libro «Los hechos de Ezquioga ante le razón y la Fe». del P. Amado de Cristo Bruguera, del que solamente quedan 10 ejemplares)",
