    "title": "'Why was he not locked up?' Hate crime detectives investigating outburst at Islamic Center of Melville",
    "text": "Hate crime detectives are investigating an outburst that was caught on camera Wednesday afternoon at the Islamic Center of Melville. A man walked into a building, which is used for religious services, demanding that the Israeli hostages be released by Hamas. Numerous requests were made by those in the mosque for him to leave, but the video went on for over a minute. Mosque officials say when police officers showed up, they spoke with the man and then let him go. Leaders of the mosque say they don't believe police took the situation seriously enough at first. \"Why was he not locked up? If he did this in any other religion other than Muslims, would it be going like this?,\" said Islamic Center of Melville President Talaat Abdelmoneim. \"That's really the concern. People already felt this way, they felt maybe it's a different way of treating it here.\" There is no word on if any arrests have been made in the incident. Mosque officials say they now believe the matter is being taken seriously as high-ranking Suffolk police officials visited the mosque on Thursday. Those at the mosque say the man has a right to protest, but that he did not have the right to act aggressively inside the mosque.",

The union claimed Inver House Distillers refused to reopen negotiations or engage with conciliation service Acas.\nIn the ballot, 78% of GMB members, who are seeking a 4% pay rise, backed strikes, while 87% backed action short of strikes.\nThe turnout was 71%.\nDavid Hume, GMB Scotland organiser in the whisky industry, said: “The ballot results reveal the determination of Inver House workers to take the action necessary to secure a fair pay offer.\n“The result could not be clearer and this rock-solid mandate from our members should send the clearest possible message to management.\n“They must reengage with negotiations, return to the table and find a fair resolution. If they do not, industrial action is now inevitable.”\nInver House’s distilleries comprise Balblair, Balmenach, Knockdhu, Old Pulteney and Speyburn.\nA spokesperson for Inver House Distillers commented: “We are disappointed by this decision. We have been fair in our approach to negotiations and would reiterate that this year’s pay rise was in line with inflation, as it is every year, and was accompanied by an annual bonus paid in December.\n“While we respect the rights of the individuals who voted in favour for this industrial strike action – 25 people across six sites, which equates to 8% of our workforce – we take great pride in being a fair and supportive employer, and in the strength of our teams and workplace communities across Scotland.”\nRelated news\nJohnnie Walker enters ‘new era of luxury Scotch’\nStarmer doubles down on pledge to ‘defend’ Scotch",

    "text": "A 20-year-old man accused of stabbing a woman during a robbery in Moreno Valley was charged Thursday with assault with a deadly weapon and other offenses. Deondre Outley Jones of Moreno Valley was arrested earlier this week following the attack in the 24900 block of Sunnymead Boulevard, near Perris Boulevard. Along with the assault count, Jones was charged with robbery and making criminal threats. He was being held in lieu of $1 million bail at the Robert Presley Jail and was slated to make his initial court appearance Thursday afternoon at the Riverside Hall of Justice. According to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, Jones allegedly confronted the victim, whose identity was not disclosed, inside a business, pulling a knife and threatening her. Sheriff's officials allege Jones stabbed her at least once and snatched her purse and jewelry, then fled the location. \"The victim sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital, where she is expected to survive,\" according to a sheriff's statement. Patrol deputies canvassed the area and spotted a man matching the description of the assailant loitering in nearby park, according to authorities. The individual, Jones, was detained and found \"in possession of the victim's property and was positively identified,\" the sheriff's department stated. Jones has no documented prior felony convictions in Riverside County. Follow KNX News 97.1 FM\nTwitter | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok",

    "text": "Rayan El Jamal was on her back porch with her family when the storm hit. I thought that there would be a deeper root holding it. I&#039;ve never thought it would fall off actually this easily, She says. The sky went black, the winds picked up, and a large tree in her front yard fell. Thankfully, it wasn&#039;t the other way. We felt on the on the House. It spared her house, but for Susan Bellmore, who was working in the barbershop across the street at the time. They&#039;re kind of devastated when you see you&#039;re not leaving and there&#039;s a big massive tree on your truck. Bellmore says even with her truck buried, she was lucky. It&#039;s amazing that there wasn&#039;t more damage. Across town, the Red Water Community Golf Course was also in the storm&#039;s path. It just sounds like the roof was just going to come off the building. And if the winds were really high, like I&#039;ve never seen that high, you&#039;re here ever. Paul Dahlman was in the back shop when the weather turned and the rain started coming down. There&#039;s so much stuff flying around. It was everywhere. The storm lasted around 30 minutes and then suddenly the sky cleared, it&#039;s sunny and it&#039;s like nothing happened. When the storm subsided, we went for a tour to see what kind of damage we had, and then that&#039;s where we put the notification out. The course will be closed today and we needed volunteers to help. Volunteers, neighbors and crews were out clearing debris off of roadways and sidewalks. You could hear chainsaws all day so far. So there&#039;s been a lot of work out. For now, the cleanup continues with relief that everyone is safe. Something terrible could have happened, but thankfully it just ended with minor damage.

    "text": "On March 10th, 79 years since the Great Tokyo Air Raid, in which approximately 100,000 people died, a memorial service was held in Tokyo's Sumida Ward, attended by bereaved families. In the early hours of March 10, 1945, during the final stages of the Pacific War, Tokyo was bombed by American B-29 bombers, causing devastating damage to Tokyo, mainly in its downtown area, and approximately 100,000 people were killed. On March 10th, 79 years after the air raids, a memorial service was held at the Tokyo Metropolitan Memorial Hall in Sumida Ward, attended by Prince Akishino and his wife. Approximately 200 people, including Tokyo Governor Koike and representatives of the bereaved families, burned incense and offered prayers for the victims. After the memorial service, Hiroyuki Ohinata (83), who attended as a representative of the bereaved family, said, ``I lost my grandfather, grandmother, and three uncles in the air raid.It's like burning many people to death indiscriminately.'' \"I want to convey to young people that even 79 years later, war was still a terrible thing.\" A 93-year-old woman who lost her 20-year-old brother in the air raid at the time said, ``He was my sister's older brother, and he died in the air raid, even though he had the best of his life ahead of him.It was really frustrating.I attend the ceremony every year, and I will continue to do so.'' \"I want to firmly convey the horrors of war to the younger generation,\" he said.",
