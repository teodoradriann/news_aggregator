    "text": "A Mattanawcook Academy player suffered a medical incident after a collision during the Lynx’s Class C North semifinal against Dexter.\nThe player dove for a loose ball and collided with a Dexter player. She appeared to have convulsions and was down on the court for about 20 minutes.\nShe was attended to by several individuals including EMTs.\nAfter 20 minutes, she was helped to her feet and placed in a medical chair and wheeled out of the Cross Insurance Center by EMTs for further evaluation. She appeared to be alert.\nA Bangor firefighter confirmed an ambulance was sent to the Cross Insurance Center, but could not share additional details.\nBangor High School Principal Paul Butler was on site Thursday for the Maine Principals’ Association, which runs the tournament. He said the player “appeared to strike her head on the floor” and seemed to experience a period of semi-consciousness.\nButler called the incident “very scary” and said that type of situation doesn’t happen often. He noted that there was a “quick response” from athletic trainers and medical personnel, and said there were good signs the player would be OK.\nMattanawcook Athletic Director Jeremy Weatherbee provided the Bangor Daily News with an update on the player’s condition Thursday night.\n“She’s in good spirits and doing better,” Weatherbee said.\nBDN reporter Marie Weidmayer contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Dublin is safe compared to other western cities, Varadkar insists | East Anglian Daily Times",
    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted. Leo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital. There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city. That scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school. Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected. Mr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists. “There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world. “But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places. “(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.” Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country. “Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else. “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",

Their tragic deaths broke the heart of Idaho. One by one, we heard their loved ones’ gut-wrenching statements at today’s sentencing hearing, and a theme emerged: we are united. We are united in healing, united in loving one another, and most of all, united in supporting the families and friends of Maddie, Kaylee, Xana, and Ethan, today and forever. I want to thank Idahoans for their strength. We will continue to move forward from this unspeakable tragedy together.\"",

    "text": "War, weddings and celebrations Palestinian style. This is Gaza, the land of the living. Here the Strip ekes of life despite the mass Israeli bombs. Mostapha Shamlakh decided to wed his fiancé in a tent on the Egyptian border after a seven-month engagement and despite the fact that 22 members of his family were massacred. He was also badly injured but decided to tie the knot just the same and look to the future despite the mass destructions. It was a colorful happy wedding with much pictures and video clips on the social media that foretold a nation that will not die but will create joy despite the misery and death. His beautiful bride Afnan Jibril looked radiant on the day of the wedding with a white and embroidered dress that looked magnificent and a flower tiara on top. There was lots of ululations in Rafah. These are a strong part of the traditions and festive ceremonies of Palestinians, their identity and culture as was the case in this wedding. Weddings in Gaza will never stop despite the Israeli gunfire. They are a sign of Palestinian tenacity. However the first wedding in Gaza was held in late 2023 in a school of displaced people. Gazans got bored of waiting for the war on them to end. They had great time as soon on the social media. It was a big party in which the thousands of people in the UNRWA school attended and enjoyed despite the bombs reigning on Gaza estimated at 100,000 tons since 7 October. And the case was true for Mohammed and Yasmin who got married in school classroom with traditional songs and candle sticks. They registered their love for life. You can be sure the Israelis won’t like this. Their aim is to make it so difficult for the Palestinians of Gaza that they would leave the Strip. The marriages and the weddings mean the Palestinians have no intention of leaving despite the mass bombings of Gaza and are a strong signal that they are determined to stay where they are.

New England had won the past 15 meetings between the teams.\nSunday also potentially marked the end of Bill Belichick’s tenure as coach of the Patriots. Belichick is reportedly set to meet with New England owner Robert Kraft this week to discuss his future with the organization.\nHall had a career-high 37 carries to take pressure off the Jets’ passing game in snowy, frigid conditions. He sealed the victory by rushing for a 50-yard TD with 1:47 left in the game, then punched in the ensuing two-point conversion.\nNew York quarterback Trevor Siemian completed 8 of 20 passes for 70 yards.\nBailey Zappe finished with 88 yards and two interceptions on 12-for-30 passing for the Patriots (4-13), who lost at least 13 games in a single season for the first time since the 1992 campaign.\nEzekiel Elliott picked up 54 yards on 13 carries as New England was outgained 254-119 and went 1-for-14 on third down.\nJust over four minutes after the Patriots failed to convert on fourth-and-1, Greg Zuerlein made a 33-yard field goal to put the Jets up 9-3 with 8:08 to play in the fourth.\nZappe was later picked off by Ashtyn Davis, who then fumbled on the return, and New England recovered with 2:44 left.\nHowever, Zappe and the Patriots weren’t as fortunate two plays later, as Tony Adams came down with another interception and held on to set up Hall’s trip to the end zone.\nNeither team managed to record a first down until Hall rushed for a gain of 3 on third-and-1 with 5:28 left in the first quarter. Seven plays later, Zuerlein booted a 21-yard field goal to give New York a 3-0 edge.\nNew England’s Chad Ryland made good on a 30-yard field goal to tie things at 3 early in the second.\nZuerlein put New York back up by three with a 40-yarder with 6:07 left in the first half. He had a chance to make it 9-3 by the break, but his 49-yard attempt with 21 seconds to go clanged off the left upright.\n–Field Level Media",
