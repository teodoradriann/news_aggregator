    "text": "PA Media: UK News Protest at Catholic girls school a sign of ‘deeper malaise’ in Northern Ireland Read full article Gráinne Ní Aodha, PA 29 December 2023 at 2:01 am · 4-min read\nA loyalist protest at a Catholic girls school in north Belfast in 2001 was a sign of a “deeper malaise” in Northern Ireland according to Bertie Ahern, new archives show.\nOfficials who compiled documentation of efforts to resolve the protest also noted criticisms of DUP MP for Belfast North Nigel Dodds for his actions, and said that then First Minister David Trimble’s efforts were integral.\nFor months in 2001, locals at Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast stood outside the school as girls and parents walked in\nIrish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern talks with Father Aidan Troy, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Holy Cross Primary School, Ardoyne, Northern Ireland, at Government buildings in Dublin (Chris Bacon/PA) The protest began following a clash in June 2001 as a man collected his child.\n“He was, according to nationalists, attacked by loyalists when he objected to them putting up paramilitary flags on the Ardoyne Road,” a briefing note stated.\nEfforts to resolve the issue over the summer break failed, and the protests resumed in the autumn.\nLoyalists said they were protesting because of attacks on their community, which they claimed were prompted by the larger Catholic population and wanted better security in the Ardoyne area as a result.\nThe note from November said: “The hate-filled aggression the loyalist protesters showed to the primary school girls and their families has disturbed, dismayed, and angered people throughout Northern Ireland and in the wider world beyond.”\nOn October 18 2001, Fr Aidan Troy had an hour-long meeting with Mr Ahern in which he discussed the impasse over the protest, which had been ongoing for months.\nFr Troy, parish priest of Ardoyne and chair of the board of governors of the Holy Cross school, said that there were around 20 people on both sides of the road in the morning, and 60-70 people on each side in the afternoon.\nAn armed policeman by his vehicle, as security was tightened for the ongoing Loyalist protest against catholic schoolchildren going to Holy Cross Primary School in North Belfast (Paul Faith/PA) “A hard core” of local residents took part in the protests and there was also a “sinister” loyalist paramilitary involvement, as well as people from other loyalist areas taking part, according to notes taken of the meeting.\nFr Troy said that some residents from Glenbryn, the protestant and loyalist area around the school, expressed support for his work, usually anonymously because of the “climate of fear” surrounding those who opposed the protest.\nStory continues He said that some children and parents had been subjected to abuse including “balloons filled with dog excrement and urine, scalding water, stones and a blast-bomb”.\nA blast bomb attack had taken place the day before the meeting on Alliance Avenue.\nOf the 220 pupils at the school, 35 were stressed and receiving counselling and medication, and 10 had been transferred to other schools.\nThe priest expressed concern that the protest could “drag on indefinitely”, as it was a no-cost effort from protesters, and said this could put an “intolerable strain” on the school community.\nHe also said that there was “a leadership vacuum” in Glenbryn, which was an impediment to progress, and the referral to a committee of 14 people with “no common agenda” made it difficult to find a resolution.\nFr Troy also said that while he appreciated the work of police to protect children on the way to school, he was “unhappy” that protesters were allowed to be so close that they were able to “spit at the children” and was confused as to why armed soldiers faced towards the parents and children.\nMr Ahern said that the root causes of the protests were a “symptom of a deeper malaise within Northern Ireland”.\nProtestant residents protest behind an RUC cordon as they demonstrate against pupils and parents making their way to the Holy Cross Girls School in Belfast (John Giles/PA) He offered to raise the issue during a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair the next day, but said that genuine progress could only be achieved through engagement and agreement at local level.\nFergal Mythen, an Irish official in the Security Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, compiled the notes of the meeting on October 22 2001.\nIn notes taken by the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat, dated November 21, it said Fr Troy was “reasonably confident” of an end or suspension to the protest ahead of a meeting with Mr Trimble and deputy first minister Mark Durkan.\nMr Dodds, who was to chair a meeting of residents at Stormont, was noted as a sign of a possible deal, as “Dodds has sat on the loyalist fence on may issues and is not known to stick his neck out unduly”.\nIn a briefing dated November 26, it called Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan’s meeting with Glenbryn residents the previous week, as well as a prompt follow-up letter “instrumental in creating the climate for a discontinuation of the protest”.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/67.\nTRENDING Davina McCall stormed off Masked Singer after close friend was

    "title": "Global outrage over Gaza has reinforced a 'siege mentality' in Israel - what are the implications for peace?",
    "text": "After more than 20 months of devastating violence in Gaza, the right-wing Israeli government’s pursuit of two irreconcilable objectives — “destroying” Hamas and releasing Israeli hostages — has left the coastal strip in ruins.\nAt least 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military, close to two million have been forcibly displaced, and many are starving. These atrocities have provoked intense moral outrage around the world and turned Israel into a pariah state.\nMeanwhile, Hamas is resolved to retain control over Gaza, even at the cost of sacrificing numerous innocent Palestinian lives for its own survival.\nBoth sides have been widely accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and mainly in Israel’s case, genocide.\nWhile the obstacles to ending the fighting remain stubbornly difficult to overcome, a troubling pattern has become increasingly apparent.\nThe very outrage that succeeded in mobilising, sustaining and swelling international opinion against Israel’s actions — a natural psychological response to systematic injustice — has also reinforced a “siege mentality” already present among many in its Jewish population.\nThis siege mentality may have undermined more proactive Israeli Jewish public support for a ceasefire and “day-after” concessions.\nA toxic cocktail of emotions\nSeveral dominant groups have shaped the conflict’s dynamics, each driven by a distinct set of emotional responses.\nFor many Israeli Jews, the massacres of October 7 have aggravated longstanding feelings of victimhood and mistrust, fears of terrorist attacks, perceptions of existential threats, intergenerational traumas stemming from the Holocaust, and importantly, the strong sense of siege mentality.\nTogether, these emotions have produced a toxic blend of anger, hatred and intense desire for revenge.\nFor the Palestinians, Israel’s devastation of Gaza has followed decades of oppressive occupation, endless rights violations, humiliation and dispossession. This has exacerbated feelings of hopelessness, fear and abandonment by the world.\nThe wider, global pro-Palestinian camp has been driven by moral outrage over the atrocities being committed in Gaza, alongside empathy for the victims and a sense of guilt over Western governments’ complicity in the killings through the provision of arms to Israel.\nSimilarly, for Israel’s supporters around the world, anger and resentment have led to feelings of persecution, and in turn, victimisation and a sense of siege.\nMany on both sides have become prisoners of this moral outrage. And this has suppressed compassion for the suffering of the “other” — those we perceive as perpetrators of injustice against the side we support.\nComplaints of bias and content omissions\nChoosing sides in a conflict translates almost inevitably into biases in how we select, process and assess new information.\nWe search for content that confirms what we already believe. And we discount information that would go against our pre-existing perceptions.\nThis tendency also increases our sensitivity to omissions of facts we deem important for our cause.\nSince early in the crisis, voices in the two camps have accused the mainstream media in the West of biased coverage in favour of the “other”. These feelings have added fuel to the moral outrage and sense of injustice among both sides.\nOutrage in the pro-Israel camp has focused mainly on a perceived global conspiracy to absolve Hamas of any responsibility.\nIn that view, Israel has been singled out as the only culpable party for the killings in Gaza. This is despite the fact Hamas unleashed the violence on October 7, used the Gazan population as human shields while hiding in tunnels, and refused to release all the Israeli hostages to end the fighting.\nOn the other side, pro-Palestinian outrage has focused on “blatant” omissions by the media and Western governments of important historical facts that could [provide context for the October 7 attacks](https://institute.aljazeera.net/en/ajr/article/october-7-battle-narratives-and-forgotten-roots-palestine).\nThese included:\nthe\n[1948 Nakba](https://theconversation.com/the-nakba-at-75-palestinians-struggle-to-get-recognition-for-their-catastrophe-204782)Israel’s decades-long\n[occupation](https://www.ids.ac.uk/opinions/contextualising-gaza-colonial-violence-and-occupation/)of the West Bank and Gaza (turning the strip into an “[open-air prison](https://www.ids.ac.uk/opinions/contextualising-gaza-colonial-violence-and-occupation/)”), andthe silence of much of the world in the face of Israel’s endless\n[violations of international laws and human rights treaties](https://opiniojuris.org/2023/10/10/reimagining-palestine-in-twail-scholarship-a-conversation-with-noura-erakat/).\nOn both sides, then, significant focus has been placed on omissions of facts that could support one’s own narrative or cause.\nA siege mentality in Israel\nMany Israelis [continue to relive October 7](https://theconversation.com/why-do-israelis-and-the-rest-of-the-world-view-the-gaza-conflict-so-differently-and-can-this-disconnect-be-overcome-223188) while remaining [decidedly blind](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2025-01-03/ty-article-opinion/.premium/if-good-israelis-are-blind-to-the-evil-in-gaza-the-war-will-never-end/00000194-28a5-d05d-a1b7-28e719d40000) to the daily horrors their military inflicts on Gaza in their name. For them, the global outrage has reinforced a long-existing and potent siege mentality.\nThis mindset has been fed by a reluctance to directly challenge Israeli soldiers risking their lives and other [rally-around-the-flag effects](https://www.thejc.com/opinion/the-sad-truth-is-that-10-months-of-war-may-have-all-been-for-nothing-as0prm8t). It’s also been bolstered by the [desire for revenge](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/eyal-mayroz-7-october-end-violence-in-israel-gaza-palestine/104440016) and an intense campaign of [dehumanising all Palestinians](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/escalating-crisis-gaza-and-israel) — Hamas or not.\nThe so-called “ring of fire” created around Israel by Iran and its proxies —Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Houthis — has further amplified this siege mentality. Their [stated objective is the destruction of Israel](https://www.smh.com.au/world/middle-east/iran-tried-to-light-a-ring-of-fire-around-israel-but-now-israel-wields-the-blowtorch-20241002-p5kfek.html).\nI’ve conducted an exploratory study of Israeli media, government statements and English Jewish diaspora publications from October 2023 to May 2025, reviewing some 5,000 articles and video clips.\nIn this research, I’ve identified strong, consistent uses of siege mentality language, phrases such as:\nIn a detailed analysis of 65 English articles from major Israeli outlets, such as The Jerusalem Post and Times of Israel, and Jewish publications in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, I found siege mentality language in nearly nine out of ten searches.\nImportantly, nearly half of these occurrences were in response to pro-Palestinian rhetoric or advocacy: campus protests and actions [targeting Israelis or Jews](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9915k219r8o), university groups [refusing to condemn October 7](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/left-response-hamas/), or foreign governments’ [recognition](https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-ireland-norway-set-recognise-palestinian-statehood-2024-05-28/) of Palestinian statehood.\nThe [sharp increase](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx285v8djejo) in attacks on Jews and Jewish installations since October 7 has also sparked global debates over rising antisemitism. Distinguishing honest critiques of Israel’s actions in Gaza from antisemitic rhetoric has become contentious, as has the use of antisemitism claims by Israeli leaders to dismiss [much of this criticism](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/netanyahu-frequently-makes-claims-of-antisemitism-critics-say-hes-deflecting-blame).\nMoving forward\nWhen viewed through the prism of injustice, the strong asymmetry between Israeli and Palestinian suffering has long been apparent. But it’s grown even wider following Israel’s brutal responses to October 7.\nThe culpability of Israel’s government and Hamas for the atrocities in Gaza is incontestable. However, many in the Israeli-Jewish public must also share some of the blame for refusing to stand up to – or by actively supporting – their extremist government’s policies.\nThe pro-Palestine movement’s justice-driven campaigns have done much to combat international bystanding and motivate governments to act. At the same time, the unwillingness to unite behind a clearer unequivocal condemnation of Hamas’ massacres may have been a strategic mistake.\nBy [ignoring or minimising](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/mis-and-disinformation-and-conspiracy-theories-about-the-october-7-hamas-attack-on-israel/) the targeting of civilians, the hostage-taking and the [reports of sexual violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-2-debunked-accounts-of-sexual-violence-on-oct-7-fueled-a-global-dispute-over-israel-hamas-war) committed by Hamas, a vocal minority of advocates has weakened the movement’s otherwise strong moral authority with some of the audiences it needed to influence most. First and foremost, this is people in Israel itself.\nMy research suggests that while injustice-based outrage can be effective at generating attention and engagement, it can also produce negative side effects. One adverse impact has been the polarisation of the public debate over Gaza, which, in turn, has contributed to the intensification of Israelis’ siege mentality.\n[Noam Chomsky](https://chomsky.info/20030228/), a well-known Jewish academic and fierce critic of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, once noted in relation to Palestinian advocacy:\nYou have to ask yourself, when you conduct some tactic, what the effect is going to be on the victims. You don’t pursue a tactic because it makes you feel good.\nThe question, then, is how to harness the strong mobilising power of moral outrage for positive ends – preventing bystander apathy to atrocities – without the potential negative consequences. These include polarisation, expanded violence, feeding a siege mentality (when applicable), and making peace negotiations more difficult.\nThe children in Gaza and elsewhere in the world deserve advocacy that will prioritise their welfare over the release of moral outrage — however justified.\nSo, what approaches would most effectively help end the suffering?\nMost immediately, the solution rests primarily with Israel and, by extension, the Trump administration as the only international actor powerful enough to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to halt the killings.\nBeyond that, and looking toward the future, justice-based activism should be grounded in universal moral principles, acknowledge all innocent victims, and work to create space for both societies to recognise each other’s humanity.",

    "title": "El primer síndico musulmán de Catalunya condena el \"menosprecio\" al catolicismo de un cartel de Carnaval en Terrassa",
    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente La ciudad de Terrassa (Vallès Occidental) se encuentra en el ojo del huracán tras la presentación del cartel oficial del Carnaval 2025 , una ilustración que ha desatado un acalorado debate sobre los límites de la libertad de expresión y el respeto a las creencias religiosas. La imagen en cuestión muestra a un obispo en una postura sugerente, con tacones rojos y aparentemente inclinado hacia el suelo mientras observa la festividad.\nDesde su presentación hace una semana, las reacciones no han cesado. Lo que algunos han considerado una expresión irreverente y festiva propia de la naturaleza transgresora del Carnaval , otros lo han calificado como una burla inaceptable hacia la religión católica. Entre las voces más críticas ha destacado la del Síndic Municipal de Greuges de Terrassa , Mustapha Ben El Fassi Mezouar, quien ha mostrado su rechazo frontal al cartel por considerar que atenta contra la convivencia y el respeto interreligioso.\nEl Síndic, una figura clave en la defensa de los derechos de la ciudadanía, ha subrayado que si bien la libertad de expresión es un derecho fundamental, esta no debe confundirse con la mofa y el escarnio a creencias profundamente arraigadas en la sociedad . \"La libertad de expresión es un derecho humano reconocido pero no debe confundirse con la mofa y el escarnio dirigido a creencias religiosas. La educación en valores y el respeto son pieza clave para la convivencia social si lo que queremos es sociedad armónica.\", ha afirmado Ben El Fassi Mezouar en sus redes sociales.\nPolémica en Terrassa por las acusaciones de \"cristianofobia\" contra el cartel del Carnaval de la ciudad\nUn síndic con la mirada plural La figura del Síndic de Greuges en Terrassa adquiere un carácter especial no solo por el peso institucional de su cargo, sino también por la historia personal de quien lo ostenta. Mustapha Ben El Fassi Mezouar es el primer síndic de origen marroquí en toda Catalunya, un dato significativo en una comunidad caracterizada por su diversidad cultural y religiosa. Su experiencia como mediador social y su compromiso con el diálogo interreligioso lo han convertido en una voz referente en cuestiones de derechos humanos y convivencia.\nBen El Fassi Mezouar ha recordado la importancia de preservar el respeto mutuo en una sociedad donde coexisten diferentes sensibilidades religiosas . En este sentido, ha apelado a la Carta Europea de Salvaguarda de los Derechos Humanos en la Ciudad, que en su artículo 5 establece que las autoridades municipales deben garantizar el respeto a la memoria de los difuntos y la dignidad de los espacios funerarios. \"No podemos tolerar que se transmita a los niños una burla a la religión católica o cualquier otra confesión y mucho menos tolerar que se permita la presentación de dicho cartel en el Cementerio Municipal, lugar que merece todo el respeto\", ha enfatizado.\nMustapha Ben El Fassi: la desconocida historia en Terrassa del primer musulmán síndico de Catalunya\nReacciones en el debate público La polémica ha trascendido el ámbito local y ha provocado un intenso debate, sobretodo, en redes sociales, donde se han sucedido los mensajes tanto de apoyo como de rechazo al cartel. Organizaciones como el Observatorio para la Libertad Religiosa y de Conciencia han impulsado una recogida de firmas para exigir su retirada, mientras que la Fundación Abogados Cristianos ha anunciado medidas legales contra los responsables de la organización del Carnaval, alegando posibles delitos de odio y ataque a los sentimientos religiosos.\nEl Consell Interreligiós de Terrassa también ha expresado su malestar, considerando que la presentación del cartel en una capilla funeraria ha sido un acto de insensibilidad hacia quienes viven su fe de manera profunda. Desde el ámbito político, formaciones como Vox y el Partido Popular han criticado duramente el diseño, calificándolo de \"cristianófobo\" y exigiendo la retirada inmediata del cartel.\nEn el otro extremo del espectro, los defensores del cartel han reivindicado la esencia satírica y provocadora del Carnaval. La comparsa 'Els Drunites', una de las organizadoras del evento, ha defendido que la irreverencia forma parte del ADN de esta celebración y que el diseño del cartel no busca atacar ninguna creencia, sino reflejar el espíritu transgresor de la festividad.\nLa tensión sigue en aumento y todo apunta a que la polémica continuará en los próximos días. Más allá de la controversia puntual, este episodio ha reavivado un debate de fondo: ¿dónde está el límite entre la libertad de expresión y el respeto a las creencias religiosas?.",

    "title": "Good Friday and Easter Sunday Bible Verses To Share On WhatsApp And Facebook Status With Friends And Family",
    "text": "Good Friday And Easter Sunday 2024:Christians around the world place great importance on sharing verses from the Bible during Good Friday and Easter. These verses convey the main concepts of Jesus Christ&apos;s death, burial, and resurrection. Easter celebrates Jesus&apos; triumphant resurrection, signifying new life and eternal hope, while Good Friday remembers his crucifixion, emphasizing themes of atonement and forgiveness.\nSharing these verses encourages self-awareness, growth in faith, and unity among believers. It also serves as a reminder of the key moments in the history of the Christian religion. By sharing these verses, believers engage in a custom that fortifies their faith, expands their understanding of God&apos;s love, and extends an invitation to others to experience the significance and joy of these holy days. For these special days, we have compiled a list of Bible verses that you can share with your loved ones.\nThinking of you on this special day! Best wishes for Easter and the season ahead. (Image Credit: Freepik)\nGood Friday 2024 Bible Verses\nMark 8:31\nAnd he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.\n1 Peter 3:18\nFor Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit.\nMark 10:34\nwho will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\"\nMay the Almighty shower you and your loved ones with the choicest blessings. Sending warm wishes on Good Friday to you! (Image Credit: Freepik)\nMatthew 12:40\nFor as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\nRomans 5:6-10\nFor while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person-though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die- but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.\n1 Peter 2:24\nHe himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
