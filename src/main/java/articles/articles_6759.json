    "text": "Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris is expected to begin training camp on the non-football injury (NFI) list after suffering a superficial eye injury in a July 4 fireworks accident. General manager Joe Hortiz said Wednesday the team is awaiting an in-person medical evaluation but expects Harris to report to the facility soon. “The plan is to probably put him on NFI,” Hortiz said via The Athletic’s Daniel Popper. “But nothing is set in stone.” Got That Big Kick Energy? Related Headlines The accident occurred in Harris’ hometown of Antioch, California , and he has been receiving treatment at Stanford Medical Center . Hortiz said the team’s medical staff has been in regular contact with doctors there and believes Harris is in good hands. “We felt like, hey, you’re there with those doctors, they’re great, get everything cleared up there,” Hortiz said. “Stanford doctors are going to be pretty good.” While the injury is not expected to impact Harris’ availability for the regular season, his absence at the start of camp opens the door for first-round rookie Omarion Hampton to see extended reps with the starters. Harris’ agent, Doug Hendrickson , described the injury as “superficial” and said his client is expected to be fully ready for the season. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport echoed that optimism, reporting Harris is “not expected to miss significant time.” Beyond football, the situation has a personal dimension. Hortiz said a close friend of Harris was severely injured in the same incident, and Harris was understandably focused on his friend’s condition. “There’s another layer to it,” Hortiz said. “His friend was severely injured. I was more concerned about his buddy.” Harris, 27, signed a one-year deal worth up to $9.25 million with the Chargers this offseason after spending four seasons with the Steelers. He never missed a game in Pittsburgh and totaled over 5,400 yards and 32 touchdowns . While the NFI designation delays Harris’ on-field debut with the Chargers, the team is confident this is a short-term issue. “Hopefully he heals quick,” Hortiz said. “You hate to see it, but we’re hopeful this is only temporary.” Subscribe to LAFB Network’s Los Angeles Chargers YouTube Channel Related Headlines",

    "title": "Angleterre : Battu par West Ham, Arsenal laisse sa place de leader à Liverpool | RTL Info",
    "text": "Partager: Liverpool reste sur le trône de la Premier League après la contre-performance de son désormais dauphin, Arsenal, battu à l'Emirates Stadium par West Ham (2-0) jeudi en conclusion d’une 19e journée qui aura vu perdre trois des cinq équipes de tête. En plus des Gunners, Tottenham a été battu à Brighton (4-2) alors que le troisième Aston Villa avait cédé en fin de match mardi à Manchester United (3-2). Cinq jours après avoir accroché les Reds à Anfield Road (1-1), Arsenal a contre toute attente cédé face à l'équipe qui l'avait éliminée de la Coupe de la Ligue début novembre. Les Hammers ont donné raison à l'analyse de leur entraîneur David Moyes, qui assurait avant le match que cette année était la meilleure de l'histoire du club, avec notamment un triomphe en Ligue Europa Conférence. Ils n'ont pas concédé la moindre occasion dans la première demi-heure de jeu, et même marqué peu avant le quart d'heure après une mauvaise appréciation de Gabriel Magalhaes, qui a profité à Tomas Soucek (0-1, 13e). L'ancien défenseur Lillois a également perdu un duel aérien décisif en seconde période face à Konstantinos Mavropanos, suite à un corner de Ward-Prowse (2-0, 55e). Souvent efficaces face au but depuis le début de la saison, les Gunners ont cette fois manqué de réalisme avec Saka (30e, 42e), Martinelli (37e), Gabriel Jesus (66e) puis Trossard dans le dernier quart d'heure. Le score aurait pu être plus cruel si Benrahma avait transformé son penalty dans le temps additionnel. Les rentrées en jeu successives de Nketiah, Nelson et Smith Rowe ont rappelé le manque de profondeur de banc à disposition de Mikel Arteta. Arsenal compte deux points de retard sur Liverpool, alors que West Ham, 6e, est à l'affut des places européennes, à trois points de Tottenham et quatre points de Manchester City, vainqueur mardi à Everton (3-1) et qui compte un match de plus à disputer. - Tottenham rechute lourdement - Peu avant, Tottenham avait sévèrement rechuté sur le terrain de Brighton (4-2) et raté l'occasion de se rapprocher de la tête du championnat. Tottenham était pourtant la meilleure équipe à l'extérieur avant cette rencontre et finit la première moitié de saison sur une note négative, malgré une bonne cinquième place au classement, à un point de Manchester City. Meilleurs ces dernières semaines après un mois de novembre catastrophique sur le plan des résultats, les Spurs ont montré un visage inhabituel avec beaucoup de passivité, comme sur cette action individuelle de Joao Pedro qui a pu passer en revue quatre joueurs et donner une balle en or à Jack Hinshelwood, démarqué à l'entrée de la surface de réparation (1-0, 11e). Entre plusieurs occasions nettes pour Brighton (17e, 32e, 45e), le même Joao Pedro allait ensuite transformer deux pénalties (23e, 75e), avec entre-temps un frappe puissante de Pervis Estupinan dans la lucarne opposée de Vicario (63e). Alejo Veliz (81e) et Ben Davies (85e) ont réduit le score, trop tard pour faire douter les Seagulls. Brighton se repositionne à la huitième place, à six points de la première place européenne.",

With a bunch of unproven names behind him on the wide receiver depth chart, Pickens needs to step up and become a true No. 1 target for the Steelers to have a successful passing game .\nNew Steelers safety DeShon Elliott has seen a lot of great wide receivers in his time around the NFL. He played with Tyreek Hill in Miami in 2023, so he knows what top wide receivers look like daily. Elliott says that he has never seen someone like Pickens, though, who makes alien-like catches every single day.\n“I had Tyreek Hill on my team,” Elliott said on The Sick Podcast — Steelers Crazy. “I have never seen a freak of nature like George Pickens.”\nPickens looked like he had another gear in his game this training camp. He put up an excellent performance , catching passes all over the football field, including as an intermediate route runner. Over the last few seasons, Pickens has largely only been a deep ball player with occasional flashes on underneath balls. Yet, suppose he can put it all together and become a dynamic route runner and separator. In that case, the Steelers will have something serious to work with in this offense, even if the pieces around Pickens in the wide receiver room are suboptimal.\nPickens has great body control and hands. That will carry with him no matter what routes he runs. The Steelers can scheme up significant mismatches even with the rest of the wide receiver room just by using Pickens in innovative ways.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC. Visit pennlive.com .

    "text": "La alcaldesa, Begoña Carrasco, acompañada de las r einas de las fiestas y de concejales de la corporación municipal, ha descubierto hoy el nuevo nombre del Almacén de Gaiatas . El nombre del artista gaiatero Pepín Marco luce desde hoy en una de las fachadas laterales de la infraestructura municipal en homenaje a su trayectoria.'En tan solo dos días empiezan las deseadas fiestas de la Magdalena que tanta pasión le producían a nuestro querido Pepín Marco, a quien le concedimos, a título póstumo, la Medalla de Oro en el aniversario de la ciudad. Es un orgullo para Castellón que el almacén donde trabajan las comisiones durante todo el año para sacar adelante los mejores monumentos, lleve el nombre del reconocido, admirado y querido artista gaiatero', ha manifestado la alcaldesa.' Hoy ya tiene nombre y apellido el almacén de gaiatas, donde Pepín pasó tantas horas y tantas noches sin dormir, por eso hoy más que nunca su luz no se apagará nunca, como la de nuestras gaiatas', afirma Begoña Carrasco. Julio José Marco Roig, c onocido por todos como Pepín Marco, dedicó su vida a la difusión y el conocimiento de las gaiatas. Amante de las tradiciones, del teatro, de la pintura y de la artesanía de las gaiatas. Era un artesano que dominaba los secretos del monumento gaiatero. El conocimiento de los materiales y su manipulación para transformarlos en piezas de una escultura de luz .Pepín fue una de las personas más importantes en el ámbito social, cultural y festivo en la ciudad de Castellón, siempre vinculado a la fiesta y la tradición, siendo un gran defensor del oficio de artista gaiater. Además, fue el creador y el primer presidente de la asociación de artistas gaiateros y lideró este colectivo con ilusión.",

    "title": "ROSEN, RESPECTED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Veradigm Inc. f/k/a Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. Investors With Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – MDRX - Veradigm (NASDAQ:MDRX) - Benzinga",
    "text": " NEW YORK,\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of common stock of Veradigm Inc. f/k/a Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. MDRX between February 26, 2021 and June 13, 2023, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important January 22, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline .\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Veradigm common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Veradigm class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=20675 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 22, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Veradigm had overstated its historical revenues by at least $20 million; (2) Veradigm had artificially inflated its revenue by recording duplicate transactions, among other things, over a more than two-year period; (3) Veradigm had artificially inflated its earnings and margins, materially misrepresenting demand for Veradigm's products and services during the Class Period; (4) Veradigm had failed to maintain effective internal controls over its financial reporting; (5) Veradigm had failed to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") regarding appropriate revenue recognition practices; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, Veradigm's financial projections were materially false and misleading and lacked any reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Veradigm class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=20675 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm , on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/ .\nAttorney Advertising.

    "text": "Cairo/Gaza: Israeli tanks advanced deep into a town in the central Gaza Strip on Thursday after days of relentless bombardment that forced tens of thousands of already displaced Palestinian families to flee in a new exodus.\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij, the armoured contingent having apparently advanced from orchards on the eastern outskirts.\nFurther south, Israeli forces struck the area around a hospital in the heart of Khan Younis, the Gaza Strip's main southern city, where residents feared a new ground push into territory crowded with families made homeless in 12 weeks of war.\nPalestinian health authorities said 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1 per cent of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead are feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nIsrael has escalated its ground offensive in Gaza sharply since just before Christmas despite public pleas from its closest ally the United States to scale the campaign down in the closing weeks of the year.\nIt launched the war to destroy the militant Islamist Hamas movement that runs Gaza after fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Of the hostages, 110 were freed during a short truce in late November and another 23 have now been declared dead in absentia, an Israeli government spokesperson said on Thursday.\nThe main focus of fighting is now in central areas south of the wetlands that bisect the narrow coastal strip, where Israeli forces have ordered civilians out over the past several days as their tanks close in.\nTens of thousands of people fleeing the densely packed Nusseirat, Bureij and Maghazi districts were heading south or west on Thursday into the already overwhelmed city of Deir al-Balah along the Mediterranean coast, crowding into hastily built camps of makeshift tents.\n\"Over 150,000 people - young children, women carrying babies, people with disabilities & the elderly - have nowhere to go,\" the main U.N. organisation operating in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a social media post.\nThe eastern part of Bureij was a theatre of heavy fighting on Thursday morning, with Israeli tanks thrusting in from the north and east, residents and militants said.\n\"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members.\n\"We are now in a tent in Deir al-Balah because of this brutal Israeli war,\" he told Reuters by phone, declining to give a second name for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad, living in a school in Deir al-Balah since fleeing from the north, said the people who were newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nWith food running out, he said he had made a perilous trip to Rafah near the Egyptian border to buy a 25-kg (55-lb) sack of flour for his family.\nFighting near hospital in Khan Younis\nKhan Younis, where Israeli forces advanced this month after a truce collapsed on Dec. 1, also came under heavy bombardment on Thursday morning from warplanes and tanks near the al-Amal hospital, west of Israeli positions.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital and has its headquarters nearby, said 10 Palestinians were killed and 12 wounded in one bombardment there, the third strike targeting the area around the hospital in less than an hour.\nResidents said they believed Israeli forces were trying to provoke a new exodus ahead of a further ground assault.\nNearby at Nasser Hospital, the main medical centre in Khan Younis and largest still functioning in Gaza, women and children shrieked as the dead and wounded were brought in.\nA toddler lay motionless on a cot while medics tried to revive him; one doctor nodded \"no,\" signalling the boy was dead.\nIsrael reported three more of its soldiers killed, bringing its toll in the ground campaign to 169. The past week has seen some of its heaviest losses of the war so far.\nVirtually all of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been driven from their homes at least once and many have been forced to flee several times. Only a handful of hospitals still function.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said it \"regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\" from a Dec. 24 air strike on the Maghazi refugee camp that killed 70 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nThe military statement said warplanes struck two targets \"adjacent\" to where Hamas militants were operating, and a preliminary inquiry showed that further buildings nearby were also hit, \"which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians\".\n\"The IDF ... is acting to draw conclusions and learn lessons from this event,\" it added.\nThe Palestinian health ministry denounced the attack as a massacre in a crowded residential square.\nOver the course of the war, The Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nU.S. President Joe Biden warned earlier this month that \"indiscriminate bombing\" in Gaza jeopardised sympathy for Israel among its allies. Washington has said Israel should make a transition from full-scale ground war to a targeted campaign against Hamas leaders.\nEgypt, which has acted as a mediator including hosting the leader of Hamas last week, said it had put forward a proposal to end the bloodshed, including a three-stage plan for a ceasefire, but had yet to hear the warring sides' responses.\nIsrael says it will not halt its ground campaign until it annihilates Hamas, describing this as its only option to safeguard its security and free remaining hostages.\nPalestinians say wiping out Hamas is an unachievable aim given the militant group's diffuse structure and deep roots in a territory it has ruled since 2007.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 21:35 IST)",
