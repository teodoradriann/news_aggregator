    "title": "iPhone 18’s A20 Chip May Offer Apple More Design Flexibility",
    "text": "Apple’s upcoming iPhone 18 may feature the A20 chip, promising new levels of performance and design flexibility. Leaked details suggest that Apple will use a 2-nanometer chip with a new packaging method, Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM). This change could make the A20 more efficient, with extra memory, enhanced speed, and better cooling.\nEnhanced Chip Packaging and Capabilities\nThe A20 will replace the current 3-nanometer A18 chip, reducing size and power use. WMCM packaging allows Apple to fit multiple dies, like CPU and GPU components, onto the same chip. This design gives Apple the flexibility to stack components vertically or place them side by side. The A20 chip is rumored to include 12GB of RAM, an upgrade from the 8GB in the iPhone 16, for faster and more responsive performance.\nWhy Apple is Switching to WMCM\nApple now uses Integrated Fan-Out (InFo) packaging, which integrates memory within the chip. WMCM, however, lets Apple combine separate dies while keeping the design compact. This flexibility could allow Apple to enhance Pro chips with extra components or adjust configurations without creating new dies. By adopting WMCM, Apple can offer varied performance levels in the iPhone lineup, benefiting both Pro and standard models.\nLooking to the Future of iPhone Design\nApple’s move to the A20 and WMCM packaging shows its drive to advance mobile tech while improving its manufacturing process. As Apple refines its chip technology, future iPhones may feature even more powerful components. If these rumors hold true, iPhone 18 users can expect better speed, increased memory, and improved thermal management. This step in chip design could redefine Apple’s flagship device, setting the stage for even more innovation.",

    "title": "Floods in Spain: 'If global warming continues at its current rate, many areas of the Mediterranean will be uninhabitable'",
    "text": "The deadly floods that struck Spain have just been added to the long list of devastating events that have been bereaving Europe and France for over 30 years. This latest disaster comes when the UN has published a new report on the inadequacy of climate policies, which are dragging the planet towards +3.1°C warming by the end of this century, and the third national climate change adaptation plan has just been unveiled. For anyone working on disasters for the past two decades, the only astonishing fact is that we still find a way to be astonished.\nThere's nothing exceptional about storms of this kind. Occurring every year in autumn, they are typical of Mediterranean climate. They are responsible for a sudden increase in the flow of rivers, which burst their banks and submerge coastal plains. Their violence is even harder to imagine, given that most Mediterranean torrents have a low flow rate. Yet the sheer width of downstream valleys is enough to convince you of the volumes of water that can flow in a matter of hours, rendering any possibility of resistance or even evacuation illusory.\nThe phenomenon of torrential flooding was well known to the ancients. Locally, they were even given names: \"aiguats\" in Languedoc, \"vidourlades\" in Sommières (In the Gard region of southern France). Over the centuries, Mediterranean societies have adapted. Houses were built on higher ground, and bridge arches and piers were calibrated to avoid being washed away or creating destructive logjams.\nArtificialized environment\nDuring the 20th century, advances in science and technology led to better weather forecasting, improved warning systems and reinforced dykes. Yet every year, disasters still occur. The cost of damage increases steadily, while the number of victims remains high.\nThere are two reasons for this paradox. First, the number of people exposed to these risks has risen sharply. Many communities have relied on tourism and the residential economy, with the continuous arrival of new inhabitants, young households or retirees, permanent or temporary residents (second homes). Demographic growth has been driven by urban sprawl in river valleys and coastal plains. Agricultural lands in particular have been subdivided to create single-story houses, which offer no refuge in the event of a sudden rise in water levels.\nOn the other hand, the environment has been extensively artificialized, with the effect of altering infiltration potential and surface runoff conditions. Roads, slabs and roofs have made the soil impermeable. Natural drains (called \"vallons\" or \"cadereaux,\" depending on the region) have been culverted or concreted over. In the huertas [areas of intensive irrigated agriculture], orchards have been replaced by greenhouses. In the event of heavy storms, precipitated water can no longer infiltrate: it runs off into the rivers, adding to their flow. Watercourses have also been dammed, dug up, \"rectified\" or diverted. Some have been slabbed over and channels blocked.\nYou have 49.2% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.",

    "text": "Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the [e-commerce](/redirection.asp?article_id=1547974&company_id=29930&redirectaddress=https://gammalaw.com/great-brain-robbery-web3-intellectual-property-rights/) business model and digital trade\nlandscape. AI systems' ability to analyze vast amounts of data,\npredict consumer behavior, and automate processes enables\nbusinesses to offer personalized shopping experiences, efficient\ncustomer service, and streamlined operations, contributing to the\nsector's exponential growth.\nAI systems generate new content, invent products, streamline\nbusiness processes, and blur the lines between products and\nservices; they also create doubt about who owns their output and\nhow they should be protected under IP laws. [Data collection and transfer](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/what-are-digital-trade-and-digital-trade-law/8E563DFB9582DD1388D484FEFE6FCAFD) lies at the heart\nof every digital trade process, and each brings new legal\nissues:\n- Global value chains enable manufacturers to manage and optimize intricate industrial processes with manufacturing and service components dispersed across different geographical locations. This raises legal issues around cross-border data transfers, compliance with foreign regulations, and protection of trade secrets.\n- Tradeable services, facilitated by technologies, eliminate the need for the physical proximity of the service provider and the consumer traditionally associated with service business models. This trend brings forth legal challenges related to licensing, taxation, and consumer protection in a digital environment.\n- IT product proliferation, such as smartphones or video game consoles, inherently requires \"servicification\": software updates, remote processing, remote data storage, and access to digital content. These services extend beyond the purchase of the initial products, transforming such products into platforms for selling services. This trend presents legal complexities around IP rights, terms of service agreements, and data ownership.\nAs businesses adopt these technologies, they must navigate a complex legal landscape. Understanding these legal challenges is crucial for organizations to protect their IPs, comply with data protection laws, and respect others' IPs. The digital nature of e-commerce further complicates this, as it often involves cross-border transactions, making it challenging to determine jurisdiction and applicable laws.\nUnderstanding and navigating these legal challenges is crucial for organizations. Protecting their in-house IPs requires more than merely safeguarding business assets; it's also about maintaining a competitive edge in the market. Conversely, respecting others' IPs is equally important, as failure can lead to costly litigation and reputational damage.\nThe advent of Web3 adds complexity. With technologies like\nblockchain and smart contracts, Web3 offers new ways of managing\nand protecting digital assets, including IP. Its borderless,\ndecentralized nature, however, also presents unique legal\nchallenges. Engaging with experienced [Web3 attorneys](/redirection.asp?article_id=1547974&company_id=29930&redirectaddress=https://gammalaw.com/ai-lawyers/) is therefore essential. These\nlegal professionals can provide guidance on how to protect IP in\nthe context of AI and e-commerce, considering the specificities of\nWeb3. They can help businesses understand the applicable laws,\ndraft robust IP protection strategies, and ensure compliance.\nHow AI Complicates IP Protection\nAI systems allow users to create text, [images](/redirection.asp?article_id=1547974&company_id=29930&redirectaddress=https://gammalaw.com/the-legal-landscape-surrounding-ai-generated-art/), audio, video, and even computer code\nat an unprecedented scale. This opens new avenues for bad actors to\ngenerate and distribute copyrighted or trademarked content without\npermission. AI could be misused to produce counterfeit products,\nreproduce proprietary designs, or generate infringing content on a\nmassive scale.\nThe e-commerce landscape is particularly vulnerable, with a wide range of online platforms where IP violations can proliferate rapidly. Key hotspots that businesses need to monitor closely include:\nOnline marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and AliExpress have become major e-commerce hubs. While enabling legitimate sales, they also provide spaces where counterfeiters can attempt to sell knockoff goods. Social media sites facilitate sharing user-generated content — including potentially infringing images, videos, and text created by AI tools. Independent e-commerce sites built on Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and similar platforms can be used by businesses and individuals alike, opening the potential for IP violations.\nAI's growing capabilities exacerbate IP scourges like [counterfeiting](/redirection.asp?article_id=1547974&company_id=29930&redirectaddress=https://gammalaw.com/trade-dress-rehearsal-becoming-your-own-fashion-police/), copyright infringement, and\npiracy, which have long plagued e-commerce. Counterfeiting is the\ntrade of fake products dishonestly marketed as real. [Copyright infringement](/redirection.asp?article_id=1547974&company_id=29930&redirectaddress=https://gammalaw.com/ai-vs-ip-whos-responsible-for-copyright-infringement/) covers the unauthorized\nuse of protected creative works like music, videos, images, and\nwriting. Piracy specifically refers to the illicit distribution of\ncopyrighted digital content.\nWhat makes AI a potent threat is its ability to automate and scale up IP violations far beyond what a human could produce manually. AI image generators could produce millions of knockoff product photos and logos. Text and code models could prolifically create infringing digital goods, descriptions, and website copy.\nGlobal expansion multiplies the IP risks for e-commerce businesses. Different countries have varying IP protection laws, legally and logistically complicating the enforcement of IP rights across jurisdictions as AI eases distribution across borders.\nAI's pattern recognition abilities could even expose a company's internal trade secrets, and customer data, analytics, and other proprietary information could be extracted and commoditized on a mass scale.\nDefending the Brand\nCounterfeiting has become a global epidemic, costing businesses billions of dollars annually. The problem is particularly pronounced in e-commerce, where unsuspecting online marketplace consumers can easily fall prey to fake products, tarnishing a brand's reputation and posing serious safety risks.\nFortunately, brands and e-commerce platforms are not powerless in the fight against counterfeiting. With the aid of an experienced Web3 intellectual property lawyer, they can leverage several legal recourses and technological solutions to defend themselves.\nAn IP attorney can assist in conducting a thorough audit of the brand's copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets and registering them with the appropriate authorities, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the Copyright Office. Registering IP assets establishes legal ownership and reserves the right to take legal action against infringers. Actions range from sending cease and desist letters and filing takedown requests with online platforms to seeking damages through civil legal action.\nE-commerce leaders have a stake in protecting the integrity of their marketplaces and maintaining consumers' trust, so many have implemented sophisticated systems and measures to combat counterfeiting and IP infringement. They use advanced computing, machine learning technologies, and big data to uncover and discipline sellers offering counterfeit goods on these platforms. This includes fake product identification modeling, image recognition techniques, semantic recognition algorithms, product information databases, real-time interception systems, and data collaboration platforms. Many also have built user-friendly, internal governance systems that support the protection of IP and their reputation as socially responsible corporate citizens. These governance models incorporate proactive monitoring and IP rights infringement early-warning systems, allowing brands to identify and address infringement quickly.\nNiche sites, such as those that facilitate transactions involving NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets, should emulate these platforms to shield themselves from liability and demonstrate their commitment to fair dealing and consumer protection.\nCombating counterfeiting and protecting IP rights is a\ncollaborative effort that requires cooperation between brands,\ne-commerce platforms, technology providers, and government\nagencies. The Electronic World Trade Platform ([eWTP](https://www.ewtp.org/)), a\nmulti-stakeholder initiative, seeks to \"incubate e-trade rules\nand foster a more effective and efficient policy and business\nenvironment for cross-border electronic trade\ndevelopment.\"\nSimilarly, when crafted with precision and foresight, terms of service and end-user license agreements create critical legal frameworks that reinforce IP protections and delineate the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved:\n- Usage: Terms of service (TOS) and end-user license agreements (EULA) explicitly outline how consumers can use the digital products or services offered by an e-commerce platform. These agreements specify permitted uses and restrictions, preventing unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and modification of copyrighted material.\n- Deterrence: Including clearly stated prohibitions and consequences demonstrates that a platform has defined legal recourse, dissuading users from engaging in activities that violate IP rights.\n- Enforcement: TOS and EULAs are enforceable contracts and legal frameworks for pursuing remedies in IP infringement cases. Brands can seek injunctions, damages, and other remedies based on the terms outlined in these agreements.\nConclusion\nAs businesses navigate the complexities of the digital marketplace, safeguarding IP assets emerges as a cornerstone strategy to maintain a competitive edge, protect revenue streams, and preserve brand reputation. The full extent of IP law offers a formidable shield in e-commerce's competitive arena. Engaging with seasoned Web3 attorneys equips brands with the knowledge, strategies, and tools necessary to fortify their IP protection efforts, securing their assets, reputation, and market position for the long term.\nThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

    "title": "Toyota RAV4 Needs a Big Screen Upgrade: Entry-Level Drivers Want More Than Mobile Mini | Torque News",
    "text": "YouTube comment sections under the 2024 Toyota RAV4's review are blowing up with praise on how great the RAV is and with complaints about how small the infotainment screen size is in the entry-level trims. Remember that the lower trims of the [2024 RAV4 vehicles](https://www.torquenews.com/1/5-things-know-about-2024-toyota-rav4) come with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, but the Limited and the TRD Off-Road get a 10.5-inch display. - \"That screen is the size of a phone! At least give us an option to upgrade.\" - \"Screen straight outta the 90s. Plus, clunky controls, no wireless charging, and no USB-C? Come on, Toyota!\" - \"CR-V's got RAV4 beat on the tech front, hands down.\" Ouch. So, what's the deal? Why the screen size fuss? Bigger is Better (for Most Drivers): Let's face it, bigger screens are just...easier. Easier to see, easier to touch, easier to navigate. They feel modern, sophisticated. In a world dominated by tablets and iPhones, a tiny screen in your car can feel like a step back. More Than Just Size: Of course, it's not just about inches. It's about the whole infotainment experience. A bigger screen opens up possibilities: clearer maps, split-screen views, and better integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. And let's not forget the fun stuff - watching videos while parked, passengers enjoying movies on road trips. Competition Heats Up: The RAV4 isn't the only compact SUV in town. [Honda's CR-V](https://www.torquenews.com/honda-cr-v), for example, boasts a standard 7-inch touchscreen, with a larger 9-inch upgrade available. That's already a step ahead of the base RAV4. And other competitors are offering even bigger screens and more advanced features. As I mentioned above the RAV4's entry level touchscreen has the size of 8.0 inch, but apparently an upgrade isn't available for the entry trims. RAV4 owners are asking for this upgrade as an option. Drivers are speaking loud and clear. They want a RAV4 that keeps up with the times, tech-wise. Offering a bigger screen option, at least in the higher trim levels, would be a smart move. It would make the RAV4 more competitive, improve driver satisfaction, and maybe even silence those YouTube commenters. So, Toyota, what do you say? Time to give the RAV4's infotainment system a much-needed upgrade? Let's upgrade the infotainment screen size in the 2025 RAV4 please. Bonus: This video from Torque News Youtube channel is about Toyota Corolla, but you can also apply it to the RAV4's touchscreen if you want to change the sound system volume.
