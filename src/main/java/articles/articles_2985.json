    "text": "Tyrone Fultz slept in a backyard last night. The 54-year-old man from Columbus' South Side didn't have anywhere else to go and hasn't for nearly a year.\nHe came to The Open Shelter on Thursday morning for a meal and is one of hundreds of people who talked to volunteers at shelters across Franklin County on Thursday from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. as part of the Community Shelter Board 's annual \"point-in-time\" count of people experiencing homelessness. The results of the count will be released in April.\nLast year's count by the shelter board of unhoused people found the single largest increase and an all-time high of people experiencing homelessness: 2,337, a 22% increase from 1,912 in 2022. Of those, 1,839 people were living in shelters or transitional housing while the other 498 were living outside or in other spaces not meant to be lived in, such as cars and garages.\nMore: Amid annual count, much is planned this year in Columbus to help the homeless find housing\nFultz said he lost his mother about a year ago and things got difficult for him.\n\"I just lost it from there,\" he said.\nSince then, Fultz said he's been sleeping outside, at friends' homes and on couches.\nAcross town, on the city's Northeast Side, similar efforts to count unhoused people ages 18 to 24 were taking place.\nHuckleberry House held its second annual \"transition age youth palooza\" at the Kenmore Square Community Center, with haircuts, a free store, food truck and other resources.\nAlexey Hudson, 21, has lived in the Kenmore Square community, an apartment complex for those ages 18 to 24, for a year. Before that, Hudson had been homeless for five years.\nYounger people like Hudson are less likely to identify themselves as being unhoused, said Sonya Thesing, executive director of Huckleberry House, which serves at-risk and homeless youth. They sleep in cars, on couches, in groups outside and often won't go to a shelter, she said.\nIt's important to count them, said Kyra Crockett-Hodge, the nonprofit's director of community outreach and engagement. But it's also \"so much more than counting kids,\" she said.\n\"It's how can we make genuine connections with young people,\" she said.\nOne way to do this is to offer young people resources such as clothing, home items, and housing and let them know they can trust those at Huckleberry House.\n\"We want them to be able to rest and say, 'I have dreams, I have goals,'\" Crockett-Hodge said. \"Our goal is to remove barriers.\"\nHuckleberry House helped Hudson get mental health counseling, identification and to start going to GED classes.\n\"I'm getting my stuff together,\" Hudson said of life now. \"I do feel safe. That's important.\"\nThe homelessness count is part of a national effort by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to determine the numbers of unhoused individuals across the nation and offer resources and funding accordingly.\nHUD's 2023 Annual Homeless Assessment Report estimated that approximately 653,100 people nationwide were experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2023 — a 12% increase (or about 70,650 more people) from 2022.\nThe increase in people experiencing homelessness at the beginning of 2023 was due in part to a large rise in the number of people who became homeless for the first time, according to Diane M. Shelley, an administrator for HUD's Midwest region. The trend started before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2016. But federal stimulus money, including substantial aid for millions of people who struggled to pay their rent and avoid eviction, help prevent a big jump in people being unhoused from 2020 to 2022, Shelly said.\nThe COVID relief funding will last through 2024 locally, but has expired in other places, contributing to another rise in homelessness, she said.\nAfter last year's record-breaking rise, the Community Shelter Board asked the county and city for $23.8 million in funding to address homelessness in central Ohio, Isom said.\nShannon Isom, president and CEO of the Community Shelter Board, expects an answer on the funding in February and said it will be used to create a stronger safety net and ways to get people out of shelters and into housing sooner, as the shelter system can't be the answer to the problem of homelessness, she said.\n\"It's a big ask, but, more importantly, it's an appropriate ask,\" Isom said of the funding. \"Housing is not a commodity — it is a basic need.\"\nShe is bracing herself for the numbers from this year, and said she expects an increase, but not on the level of last year's.\nMore than 200 volunteers participated in the count, which includes searching for people sleeping in cars in parking lots; dropping by soup kitchens, meal sites and warming centers; or seeking those sleeping in known encampments and on the streets.\n\"All any of us want in this world is to feel seen and heard and the way to do that is to build community,\" said Sarah Hatchard, director of guest services at The Open Shelter. \"You can't begin to understand where people come from unless you offer them a safe space to be themselves.\"\ndking@dispatch.com\n@DanaeKing",

    "text": "Despite the bitter cold temperatures on Saturday, sailors on the USS Normandy were welcomed home with warm hugs. After eight months apart and 262 days away at sea, sailors like Paul Lance said it's good to be back. \"I feel great. I'm happy to be back and I'm happy to be home,\" said Lance. The USS Normandy was the last unit of the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to return to Norfolk. Its deployment was extended three times, creating a roller coaster of emotions for families in the 757. \"There were so many times where I thought he was going to come home and they kept getting extended so it's very rewarding to see him back here,\" said Rachel Lance, wife of one of the USS Normandy sailors. The strike group left Naval Station Norfolk May 2, and spent the majority of its deployment in the Mediterranean following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. For about 70% of the crew, this was their first deployment and it was also a very long one, extended by more than 70 days. After being thousands of miles away from home, sailor Garett Malone says he's looking forward to making up for lost time. \"My daughter has grown up so much and I can't believe it. She was hardly crawling when I left and now she's running around and talking and everything,\" said Malone. \"We're very happy to be reunited again,\" said wife, Samantha Malone.",

La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha vuelto a ampliar, en este caso hasta las 15.00 horas de este viernes, 1 de noviembre, el [aviso rojo por lluvias en el litoral de Huelva,](https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2024/11/01/dana-lluvia-y-tormentas-ponen-en-aviso-este-viernes-a-siete-provincias-1774502.html) mientras que en las comarcas de Aracena, Andévalo y Condado el aviso continúa siendo naranja por lluvias y amarillo por tormentas. Así lo han indicado a Europa Press desde el servicio de Emergencias 112 Andalucía. La Aemet prevé que en el litoral de Huelva la precipitación acumulada en doce horas ha sido de 140 litros por metro cuadrado, y se estima que continúen con \"gran intensidad\" las lluvias en la zona de aviso \"durante las próximas horas\". De otro lado, en la zona de Aracena la precipitación acumulada en una hora es de 30 litros por metro cuadrado, al igual que en el Andévalo y en el Condado onubense. Asimismo, el 112 ha indicado que las incidencias rozan ya el centenar, y que los últimos avisos se han dado en La Antilla (Lepe), Isla Cristina y Cartaya, nuevamente por anegaciones en sótanos y entrada de agua en viviendas. Por otra parte, el alcalde de Punta Umbría, José Carlos Hernández Cansino, ha remitido un audio a los medios informando de que la noche ha sido \"tensa\" con grandes lluvias y tormentas eléctricas, así como ha subrayado que las precipitaciones han sido de \"119 litros por metro cuadrado\". \"Precaución\" a la población Al respecto, ha apuntado que \"no hay que destacar daños especiales, nada más que daños en algunos bajos, algunas zonas de casas en las que ha entrado agua\" y \"calles que se han inundado, pero que ya prácticamente están volviendo a la normalidad\". El alcalde de Punta Umbría, que ha pedido \"precaución\" a la población, ha explicado que \"han estado cortadas las carreteras de acceso a Punta Umbría, tanto la autovía que viene de Huelva como las que unen la zona de El Portil con Cartaya y la carretera de Malpica\", pero que \"ya se han abierto y han vuelto a la normalidad\", así como en la zona del Rincón ha habido \"algún problema más, porque el arroyo que discurre por allí se ha desbordado\", pero \"no hay que lamentar ningún tipo de daño personal\". En Cartaya, el Ayuntamiento ha indicado en su cuenta de Facebook que está activo el Plan Local de Emergencias y que las lluvias han provocado el corte de algunos tramos de carretera que unen el municipio con su núcleo de El Rompido, así como se han registrado hundimientos e inundaciones en algunos tramos de calzada y principalmente en bajos y garajes en El Rompido y El Portil y el parking del hotel Nuevo Portil Golf. El alcalde, Manuel Barroso, ha pedido a los ciudadanos \"precaución y responsabilidad\" y que, \"en la medida de lo posible\" eviten desplazamientos y sigan \"en todo momento\" las indicaciones de los Cuerpos y Fuerzas de Seguridad del Estado y de los dispositivos de emergencias que están trabajando \"para garantizar la seguridad ciudadana\".",

    "text": "PORTLAND, Maine — In just a couple of weeks, NEWS CENTER Maine will be holding its annual blood drive at [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/) donation centers across the state. It's blood drives like these that save lives, Raymond Poulin says, including his own. Poulin fell ill in 2013, but he thought it was just the common cold or flu. After a few blood tests, doctors told him he had sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection, which turned into septic shock. He experienced organ failure and was induced into a coma. He said his liver hemorrhaged while he was in a coma, and he was in need of a significant amount of blood. Doctors gave him less than a 10 percent chance to live. He underwent emergency surgery, where he was given 77 units of blood. \"If the units weren’t there when I needed it, I wouldn't be here today,\" Poulin said. \"I'm living proof that blood donations save lives.\" He had a long journey to recovery, needing to learn how to walk again and about a monthlong hospital stay. However, that near-death experience ignited a purpose to help others. Poulin spent the next six years organizing his own blood drives with the help of his family. The goal was to donate 77 units to give someone else the same chance at life that he was awarded. \"My wife and I knew we wanted to give back,\" he said. \"It's so important to give others the same chance that I had. Every day’s a gift.\" His blood drives generated more than 800 units, more than 10 times his goal. But he didn't quite feel fulfilled. \"I always knew in my heart that one day I wanted to work for the Red Cross,\" Poulin said. More than a decade after his near-death encounter, that idea came to fruition. He started working at the American Red Cross six months ago as Northern New England's district manager for donor recruitment. \"To be working at the Red Cross is almost like a dream come true. Again, working for the company that was part of saving my life a decade ago, it’s just an amazing feeling,\" he said. Poulin now oversees all of the blood drives in the state of Maine. \"I not only understand the mission, I’ve lived the mission. If it weren’t for the amazing blood donors out there, again, I wouldn’t be here. I can't thank you [the donors] enough from the bottom of my heart,\" Poulin said. NEWS CENTER Maine is joining the Red Cross on March 27 to help Mainers in need.

    "text": "新华社记者刘诗平、魏弘毅\n当前，陕西、河南、江苏、湖北、广西等省区存在重旱。其中，陕西南部、河南西部、湖北西北部、江苏南部等地达到特旱级别。旱情带来哪些影响？会否持续和发展？南方地区7日开始的降雨过程在多大程度上能缓解旱情？水利、气象部门有关人士对此进行了分析、解读。\n一问：旱情如何\n“今年以来，受温高雨少影响，华南、华北、西北、长江中下游以及四川等地干旱快速发展。”国家气候中心气象灾害风险管理室正研级高工翟建青说，1月1日至5月6日，广西、安徽和江苏平均干旱天数均为1961年以来历史同期最多。4月18日，全国中旱及以上干旱面积达201.8万平方公里，其中特旱面积47.7万平方公里。\n翟建青说，4月19日以来，南方降水逐渐增多，华南气象干旱逐渐缓和；19日至21日，北方旱区出现降水过程，干旱有所缓和，但4月下旬以来，陕西南部、河南西部、安徽和江苏中南部等地干旱又有所发展。\n就珠江流域而言，2024年11月以来遭遇“丰枯急转”。水利部珠江水利委员会主任吴小龙说，截至5月7日，西江流域平均降雨量仅193毫米，较常年同期偏少5成，为1961年有完整气象资料以来最少。5月1日以来，西江流域出现2次强降雨过程，一定程度上缓解了当前广西旱情。\n“今年以来，黄河流域降水偏少近3成，其中黄河中游偏少3成至4成，晋陕豫局部地区出现不同程度旱情。”黄河水利委员会水资源管理局水量调度处一级主任科员王伟禄说，截至5月7日，黄河干流龙羊峡、刘家峡、万家寨、三门峡、小浪底五大水库共蓄水275.45亿立方米，比去年同期少2.54亿立方米。\n二问：影响几何\n国家气候中心气候预测室首席预报员高辉表示，干旱会造成土壤墒情不足，直接影响农作物生长；会导致水资源管理与调配压力增大，同时导致植被干燥，森林火险气象等级持续偏高。\n“具体到农业方面，受干旱影响，冀豫晋陕甘等地灌溉条件不足的麦田长势偏差，目前大部地区小麦处于开花至灌浆期，部分没有灌溉条件的小麦灌浆受阻。”翟建青说，广西、四川、云南等地部分水稻移栽进度较去年偏迟，部分已播春玉米、花生等旱地作物出现缺苗断垄或幼苗矮小。\n江苏部分地区因旱情不利于晚播麦的苗情转化升级，导致生育进程不整齐，部分小麦因旱发生卷叶现象。广西部分地区江河、水库水位下降明显。\n针对旱情，相关部门和地方采取各种措施保灌。截至4月底，全国春灌面积近3亿亩，累计供水293亿立方米。当前，全国水库蓄水总量较常年同期略偏多，大中型灌区春灌用水总体有保障。\n三问：还会持续多久\n中央气象台预报，7日至9日，南方地区将出现较强降水过程，西南地区东部、江南、华南大部地区先后有大到暴雨，局地有大暴雨。这场降雨过程会否有效缓解旱情？\n高辉说，结合中央气象台中短期预报和国家气候中心延伸期预测，近期广西的干旱将会逐步减缓，但陕西、河南、江苏等地的气象干旱还将持续。\n“降水有利于广西旱情的进一步缓解，但降水分布不均、局地强度较大，需警惕出现旱涝急转。”中央气象台首席预报员郭安红说，目前，河北南部、山西西南部、河南西部、陕西关中、安徽西北部等冬麦区存在不同程度农业干旱。8日至9日，河北中东部、河南南部和苏皖北部有10毫米至50毫米降水，土壤缺墒状况将得到改善，但其余旱区农业干旱将持续。\n吴小龙表示，本次降雨过程预计西江干支流将出现涨水过程，对进一步缓解广西旱情有利，但云南部分旱情尚未得到明显缓解。\n四问：如何应对\n翟建青表示，农业方面，各地需根据苗情和当地实际情况，分类采取灌溉措施。气象部门需加密监测天气条件，如有增雨作业条件，可适时开展增雨作业，短期内增加降水量，以缓和旱情。\n翟建青提醒，干旱期应注意避免采取大水漫灌等不当灌溉方式，减少氮肥施用，多施磷、钾肥增强作物抗逆性，避免干施化肥引发肥害。\n“西北地区东部、华北南部等地要加强田间管理，积极实施灌溉、保墒等抗旱措施，加强病虫害的监测和预防。”国家气候中心气候变化影响适应室研究员张存杰说，江淮、江汉、黄淮等地，冬小麦处于成熟和收割期，后期降水过程较多，需防发生旱涝急转灾害，以及雨涝天气对小麦收获和晾晒造成不利影响。\n目前，旱区各相关单位和农户正在持续开展抗旱工作。\n“今年以来珠江流域灌区累计供水1.64亿立方米，实现有效灌溉面积125万亩，各类农作物均能及时播种。同时，动态控制大藤峡水库水位，群众饮水及春耕用水需求得到满足。”吴小龙说，下一步，珠江委将加强流域统筹，会同地方全力做好抗旱保供保灌。\n王伟禄表示，黄委将动态掌握引水情况，确保城乡居民饮水安全，确保规模化养殖和大牲畜用水安全，全力保障灌区农作物时令灌溉用水。\n水利部水旱灾害防御司抗旱处处长王为说，水利部门将持续加强监测预报，制定完善供水保障方案，科学精准调度相关流域骨干水工程，全力确保旱区城乡供水安全和北方小麦主产区抗旱用水需求。\n关于中工网 |版权声明 | 违法和不良信息举报电话：010-84151598 | 网络敲诈和有偿删帖举报电话：010-84151598\nCopyright © 2008-2025 by www.workercn.cn. all rights reserved",

    "text": "MEDITERRANEAN SEA - Born out of Aiken, a small suburban town in South Carolina, Cpl. Kate McCaskill, a Fire Direction and Control (FDC) Marine, is the only enlisted female artillery Marine deployed with Sierra Battery, Battalion Landing Team 1/6, 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) (26MEU(SOC).\nThe battery or platoon Fire Direction and Control is the control center, or ‘brains’, of the gunnery team. Cpl. McCaskill's role aboard the USS Mesa Verde (LPD 19) involves mission processing for artillery, receiving calls for fire from a forward observer, ensuring the target is in range, and accurate hits on target.\nDuring the course of the 26th MEU(SOC)’s deployment within the U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/Sixth Fleet area of operations, McCaskill has participated in several multi-lateral, exercises to include: Norway Bilateral Exercise, Exercise Northern Coasts 2023, and the Spanish bilateral exercises, conducting FDC training with U.S. Allies and partners including Germans, Italians, Latvians, Norwegians, and Spanish militaries to exchange knowledge and expertise acquired throughout their military training to strengthen interoperability and interdependence with our partners in the U.S. European Command area of responsibility.\n\"Being underway between missions has allowed us to constantly sharpen our skills with whitespace training in order to remain ready during deployment,\" McCaskill expressed.\nMcCaskill was inspired to become a U.S. Marine following a high school field trip to Parris Island, South Carolina, visiting the heart of where Marines are made, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot. It was then Cpl. McCaskill realized she wanted to be a part of something much bigger than herself.\n\"Going on that field trip stirred something inside of me that made me want to do my part and to leave my mark in the U.S. Marine Corps,\" said McCaskill. Her admiration of weapon systems steered her immediately into the artillery field. Additionally, being one of the few female Marines in her Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) school only motivated her more to strive harder to do her very best to master her craft.\nWhile deployed, McCaskill's ability to adapt to new environments and to stay sharp as a Marine is credited to her mentor and direct leadership, Sgt. Corey Hodge, a platoon operation chief.\n\"I have worked with Cpl. McCaskill for over a year and a half now and she's a proven hard-worker, stand-out performer, and leader,\" said Sgt. Hodge. \"During this deployment, she has taken up multiple responsibilities and has stepped up into leadership roles by leading Marines on the range with a driven attitude.\"\nMcCaskill isn’t hard to find within the ranks of the Marines embarked on the USS Mesa Verde – she is immediately impressive and upholds the values and standards of the Marine Corps. In addition to be mentally and physically tough, Cpl. McCaskill is an inspirational teammate going the extra mile to ensure the 26th MEU(SOC) remains ready, relevant, and capable of executing missions across the full spectrum of military operations.\nThe 26th MEU(SOC) serves as one of the United States’ premier crisis response forces capable of conducting amphibious operations, crisis response, and contingency operations, to include enabling the introduction of follow-on-forces and designated special operations, in support of theater requirements of the Geographic Combatant Commander. Coupled with the USS Bataan ARG, the 26th MEU(SOC) serves as a premier stand-in force with a full complement of all-domain capabilities to operate persistently within the littorals or weapons engagement zones of any adversary.\nMarines and Sailors of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), embarked on the ships of the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group, are on a scheduled deployment as the Tri-Geographic Combatant Command crisis response force with elements deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet and U.S. 6th Fleet areas of operation to increase maritime security and stability, and to defend U.S., Allied, and Partner interests.\n|Date Taken:||11.06.2023|\n 12:33|\n|Story ID:||461024|\n|Location:||MEDITERRANEAN SEA|\n|Hometown:||AIKEN, SC, US|\n|Web Views:||10|\n Brain and Backbone: New Environments, New Targets, by\n[Cpl Aziza Kamuhanda](/portfolio/1740070/aziza-kamuhanda), ",
