    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "an astonishing PC-Windows tablet hybrid doped with Ryzen",
    "text": "2024-01-05 16:59:26\nA major specialist in mini PCs, Minisforum is launching into a new market with its V3, an astonishing hybrid Windows computer that can act as a touchscreen tablet and external screen, powered by a powerful AMD processor.\nMini PC manufacturers seem in better shape than ever. It must be said that the growing success of their miniature computers, increasingly appreciated by users, gives them wings by pushing them to innovate. And if some seek to expand their catalog with gaming-oriented PCs, like Geekom with its attractive Mini FUN series, others do not hesitate to launch into new markets with astonishing products. This is the case of Minisforum, a major specialist in mini PCs, which will market its V3 in a few weeks, a curious device serving as a laptop, touch tablet and external screen. And the least we can say is that this curious hybrid surprises with its technical characteristics combining many recent technologies.\n© Minisforum\nLike some Microsoft Surfaces, the V3 is first presented as a touchscreen tablet. But not as a simple Android model. First, because it runs under Windows 11. Secondly, because it is immediately high-end, with components worthy of a real laptop.\nThus, the V3 is equipped with a beautiful 14-inch diagonal screen in 16:10 format with QHD+ definition (2560 x 1600 pixels) and a refresh rate of 165 Hz (a detail that will especially appeal to gamers). If the technology used for the panel is not specified, everything suggests that it will be an IPS type model because the maximum brightness promised is 500 nits, which is more than correct compared to the screens of Current laptops (excluding Oled models). And Minisforum announces colorimetry corresponding to 100% of the DCI-P3 standard, which promises excellent color respect. Note that although it is obviously tactile, the screen can also be used with an active stylus compatible with Microsoft Pen Protocol 2.6, with 4096 pressure levels. The accessory can be magnetically attached to one of the sides of the V3, but Minisforum does not specify whether it will be supplied automatically.\n© Minisforum\nDespite its large screen, closer to a laptop than a tablet, the V3 remains quite compact and light with 31.8 cm in length, 21.4 cm in width and 9.8 mm in thickness for a weight of only 946g. And its aluminum and magnesium alloy chassis seems well made, with flat sides that give it the look of a giant iPad.\nBut the V3 surprises above all with its “engine”. Unlike Android tablets, which are equipped with ARM chips, it is in fact equipped with a latest generation AMD Ryzen 7 processor, in Zen 4 technology with 8 cores and 16 threads. And if Minisforum does not specify its exact reference, we can expect very good performance since it operates at 3.3 GHz (5.1 GHz in turbo mode) while integrating a Radeon 780M type graphics circuit; like the excellent Ryzen 7840HS which is now found in several mini PCs. Enough, a priori, to run all kinds of applications, even demanding ones, including demanding games.\n© Minisforum\nMinisforum V3: a PC-tablet hybrid that can serve as an auxiliary screen\nThat’s not all ! The V3 also includes DDR5 RAM (up to 32 GB) and an NVMe SSD (with a capacity of up to 2 TB), like a real PC. And it is also well equipped in terms of interfaces: because in addition to Wi-Fi6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless communications, it has two USB-C sockets to the USB 4.0 standard for connecting all kinds of peripherals, charging the battery or even send a video signal to an external display. Better yet, a third USB-C port with the VLink standard serves as a video input (DisplayPort standard), which allows the V3 to be used as an auxiliary screen for another device (computer, smartphone, etc.). A very original function which gives it real versatility.\n© Minisforum\nFor the rest, the V3 displays typical characteristics of a mid-range tablet, with a stereo minijack socket for audio, four speakers for stereo sound reproduction, a 2 Mpx front camera for selfies and visios associated with a facial recognition system, a 5 Mpx rear camera for photos and videos, a switch equipped with a fingerprint sensor and various sensors. Nothing to say, it’s quite complete.\nIn terms of energy, the V3 has a 50 Wh battery, but Minisforum says nothing about autonomy, which should depend on use and the processor, which can consume 15 to 28 W depending on the power supply mode. selected. Cooling is provided by a copper heat pipe and two ultra-thin fans.\n© Minisforum\nFinal details, the V3 will be delivered with a detachable keyboard (for use in PC mode) and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, like all Chinese mini PCs. Minisforum indicates availability during the first quarter of 2024, but does not give any price. Difficult to say if this astonishing hybrid device will keep all its promises and if it will meet its audience. But, on paper, it has many advantages to replace a laptop and a tablet while also serving as a secondary screen if necessary. Above all, its Ryzen 7 processor opens the door to a wide range of applications, including in the field of gaming. So be patient.\n1704503514\n#astonishing #PCWindows #tablet #hybrid #doped #Ryzen",
