    "title": "Black Republican lawmaker slams Nikki Haley’s Civil War flop",
    "text": "Florida Republican Representative Byron Donalds has slammed GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley after she flip-flopped on the cause of the US Civil War. “1. Psst Nikki... the answer is slavery PERIOD,” Mr Donalds tweeted on Thursday. “2. This really doesn’t matter because Trump is going to be the nominee. Trump 2024!” The former South Carolina governor and UN Ambassador avoided mentioning slavery when she was asked by a voter in New Berlin, New Hampshire, on Wednesday night what caused the Civil War. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn’t do. What do you think the cause of the Civil War was?” she said. The man, who subsequently told reporters his name was Patrick, replied he wasn’t the one running for president. “I mean, I think it always comes down to the role of government,” Ms Haley said. “We need to have capitalism, we need to have economic freedom. We need to make sure that we do all things so that individuals have the liberties so that they can have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do or be anything they want to be without government getting in the way.” “In the year 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you can answer that question without mentioning the word ‘slavery’,” the voter said. “What do you want me to say about slavery? Next question,” Ms Haley said. She later backtracked on her comments on Thursday morning during an appearance on The Pulse of NH radio programme. “Of course, the Civil War was about slavery, that’s the easy part. I know it was about slavery. I am from the South,” she said . “But more than that, what’s the lesson in all this? That freedom matters,” she added. “And individual rights and liberties matter for all people. That’s the blessing of America. That was a stain on America when we had slavery. But what we want is never relive it. Never let anyone take those freedoms away again.” She went on to claim on the programme that the Democrats “are sending plants” to her events, according to the NH Journal. “Why are they hitting me? See this for what it is ... They want to run against Trump. In town halls, I answer every question, and they are planting questions there,” she claimed. “It was definitely a Democrat plant ... He didn’t give reporters his name,” she added of the questioner. Mr Donalds has confirmed that he’s considering a run for governor in 2026 at the end of current Sunshine State governor and 2024 candidate Ron DeSantis’s second term. The 45-year-old, who has already endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 race, was one of nine Republicans who ran for speaker earlier this year following the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy but he received meagre support in votes behind closed doors among House Republicans. Mr Donalds has previously called out Mr DeSantis for his administration’s policies on the teaching of Black history. He tweeted on 26 July: “The new African-American standards in [Florida] are good, robust, and accurate. That being said, the attempt to feature the personal benefits of slavery is wrong and needs to be adjusted. That obviously wasn’t the goal and I have faith that [the Florida Department of Education] will correct this.” Mr Donalds also received some votes for speaker in January after he was nominated by Texas Rep Chip Roy amidst an attempt from hardliners in the House GOP to stop Mr McCarthy’s tenure before it had even begun, leading to Mr McCarthy needing 15 attempts to finally grasp the gavel. Mr DeSantis also criticised Ms Haley on Thursday, saying, “Nikki Haley has had some problems with some basic American history … Not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War”.",

При возникновении НМУ возможно ухудшение качества атмосферного воздуха в населенных пунктах. Одним из важнейших факторов, определяющих формирование уровня загрязнения, является прогноз синоптической ситуации (ветер, осадки, влажность, температура воздуха).\nПри неблагоприятных метеоусловиях рекомендуется:\n- сократить время пребывания на открытом воздухе, особенно вблизи автотрасс или других источников загрязнения;\n- детям и беременным женщинам следует отказаться от длительных прогулок;\n- людям, страдающим хроническими заболеваниями легких, сердечно-сосудистыми, аллергическими заболеваниями, при нахождении на открытом воздухе необходимо иметь при себе лекарственные препараты;\n- ограничить физическую нагрузку на открытом воздухе, занятие физкультурой и спортом желательно проводить в закрытых спортивных комплексах.\nЧитайте по теме:\nНепогода накроет Казахстан: в течение трех суток ожидаются дожди, грозы и пыльные бури\nПОДПИСЫВАЙТЕСЬ НА НАС В TELEGRAM\nУзнавайте о новостях первыми\nПодписаться",

    "text": "A Promising Target for New Pain Treatments | NIH News\nThe NIH's Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative (or NIH HEAL) seeks to stem the national opioid public health crisis by supporting the development of innovative medications and non-addictive interventions for opioid addiction and chronic pain. MBL Senior Scientist Joshua Rosenthal received a NIH-HEAL grant in 2021 to further his research on using RNA editing to reduce pain signals issuing from a protein (Nav1.7) that connects pain-sensing cells to the brain and spinal cord. Below is an update from the National Institutes of Health on several NIH-HEAL efforts, including Rosenthal's.\nEvery year, health care providers prescribe millions of doses of pain medications. Yet these medications don’t work for everyone; may not fully control the individual’s pain; and come with their own health risks, such as addiction.\nNew safe, effective, and non-addictive pain medications are urgently needed for the 50 million Americans living with chronic pain, half of whom have severe pain that significantly impacts their daily living. Over the past 5 years, no innovative pain medications with new targets have been approved other than for migraine, but researchers are hopeful this will change.\nScientists funded by the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term® Initiative, or NIH HEAL Initiative®, are on the quest for new, non-addictive pain medications. One target that they have evaluated in recent years is a protein called Nav1.7, which is thought to be crucial for sending pain signals from pain-sensing cells to the spinal cord and brain. ...\nResearchers hope that by turning off or toning down Nav1.7 activity, they can silence pain-sensing cells and thus relieve pain. Various teams are pursuing different approaches to achieve that goal. Read rest of the article here.\nSource: Closing in on Nav1.7: A Promising Target for New Pain Treatments | NIH News",

    "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Monday's weather falling on a federal holiday did not keep kids from having a snow day. Sounds of laughter filled the frigid air near the Clinton Presidential Library as dozens spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday out on sleds, or in some cases— pool inflatables and cardboard. \"We have a big avocado here, soon-to-be ruptured pool toys, and a broken donut,\" said sledders Isabella Branton, Peter Branton, and Andrea Flores Ruz. No matter what they used to slide on, these families went to make some fun snow day memories and they even brought four-legged friends. For many people, the Clinton Library is a go-to spot when there's snow outside. \"We come every time we can. So I think it's like number four or five. Like enough snow to come out,\" Symone Blagg said. The bitter cold didn't stop Blagg from enjoying her day. In fact, she said she didn't feel it. \"I'm very hot. Like I've got on enough clothes that I could I could take a layer off. I'm sweating,\" she explained. Blagg said this snow is different than previous ones because it's much drier and that makes a big difference on the sleds. \"This dry snow like you get stuck a lot more. If it's like wet or more slippery, you can go further faster,\" Blagg added. Regardless of speed, she and her kids went for a good time, not a long time. \"It doesn't happen too often, but we do like the snow and snow days,\" Flores Ruz said.",

    "text": "A mpox está avançando no mundo com mais de 99 mil casos confirmados desde 2022, segundo a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS). O Brasil, que ocupa o segundo lugar em número de casos, já vacina contra a doença, mas, ao menos por enquanto, só imuniza pessoas de grupos vulneráveis ou que tiveram contato com doentes.\nA mpox, antiga varíola dos macacos (monkeypox) é uma doença causada pelo mpox vírus (MPXV) da família pox. A transmissão para humanos pode acontecer por meio de contato com a pessoa infectada, animal silvestre (roedores) ou materiais infectados pelo vírus, segundo o Ministério da Saúde.\nDe acordo com a OMS, há o conhecimento de dois clados (grupos de vírus) em circulação da doença: clado 1 e clado 2, sendo que o novo surto no Congo é causado por uma nova ramificação do clado 1. Esse subtipo está associado a um risco mais elevado de evolução e taxa de mortalidade mais alta, aponta a entidade.\nNesta quinta-feira (15), a Suécia confirmou o primeiro caso de mpox da variante clado 1 no país, sendo o primeiro caso da cepa mais perigosa diagnosticado fora do continente africano. De acordo com o\ncomunicado da Agência, o caso relatado é de uma pessoa que foi infectada durante \"uma estadia numa parte de África onde a propagação do mpox clado 1 está em curso\".\nAinda não há casos confirmados da nova cepa no Brasil, mas o país já notificou, somente em 2024, 709 casos confirmados ou prováveis da doença. Já desde os primeiros registros da mpox no Brasil em 2022, foram mais de 10 mil casos notificados e 16 mortes.\nVacinação já é feita no Brasil\nA vacina contra a mpox já é aplicada no Brasil desde 2023, período de Emergência de Saúde Pública de Importância Internacional, com uma licença da Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (Anvisa) em casos excepcionais para grupos muito vulneráveis e para pessoas que tinham tido contato com outras pessoas infectadas.\nIsso acontece porque o contingente de vacinas atualmente é insuficiente para atender um público maior, sendo este público o mais vulnerável — com maior risco de hospitalização e morte, explica Alexandre Naime Barbosa, coordenador científico da Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia (SBI). No entanto, esse cenário não é uma exclusividade do Brasil.\n\"Eles [esse público] vão ter a melhor relação custo-benefício dentro de um contingente pequeno de vacinas disponíveis. O contingente não é o suficiente para todos os públicos elegíveis, como idosos, profissionais de saúde, mas isso é a nível mundial\", diz o especialista.\nVeja quem pode se vacinar contra a mpox:\nSegundo o Ministério da Saúde, a estratégia de imunização no país \"prioriza a proteção das pessoas com maior risco de evolução para as formas graves da doença\". A a vacina é aplicada em duas situações: pré e pós-exposição ao vírus.\n- Pré-exposição — pessoas vivendo com HIV/aids (PVHA): homens cisgêneros, travestis e mulheres transexuais; com idade igual ou superior a 18 anos; e com status imunológico identificado pela contagem de linfócitos T CD4 inferior a 200 células nos últimos seis meses; profissionais de laboratório que trabalham diretamente com Orthopoxvírus em laboratórios com nível de biossegurança 2 (NB-2), de 18 a 49 anos de idade;\n- Pós-exposição: pessoas que tiveram contato direto com fluídos e secreções corporais de pessoas suspeitas, prováveis ou confirmadas para mpox, cuja exposição seja classificada como de alto ou médio risco, segundo as recomendações da OMS e mediante avaliação da vigilância local.\nEficácia contra nova cepa\nAtualmente, são utilizados dois imunizantes: Jynneos e Imvanex, ambos aplicados em duas doses com intervalo de 28 dias, segundo o\nMinistério. Embora esses vacinas estejam disponíveis exclusivamente pelo SUS, elas não estão incluídas no Plano Nacional de Imunização (PNI).\nEm fala feita nesta quinta durante uma coletiva sobre o assunto, a ministra da pasta, Nísia Trindade, ressaltou que a vacinação \"nunca será uma estratégia em massa para a mpox\" e pediu que \"a população não se sinta desprotegida por não ter a vacina\".\nJá sobre a eficácia dos imunizantes para a nova cepa, Nísia informou que ainda estão sendo feitos estudos por especialistas, uma vez que são casos novos. \"Em alguns casos, pode atenuar, mas pode não ser determinante contra essa nova cepa. O mais importante neste momento é a vigilância\", disse.\nEmergência global\nNesta quarta-feira (14), a OMS declarou emergência global de saúde pública em relação ao surto de mpox após o aumento de casos da doença na República Democrática do Congo, que também se espalhou para outros países da região.\nRenato Kfouri, vice-presidente da Sociedade Brasileira de Imunizações (SBIm), explica que a decisão da entidade de declarar emergência global \"é uma precaução\". \" \"Um estado de alerta para que todos os países estejam atentos a essas possibilidades de disseminação.\"\nO alerta da OMS, diz o especialista, é para que os países aloquem os recursos para produção de vacina, medicamentos e testes diagnósticos para um eventual enfrentamento de disseminação do vírus no planeta.\n[Mais recente](#) Próxima Haddad tem reunião com presidente da Eletrobras em meio a negociações sobre Eletronuclear",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nAllegations have emerged of a Tesla engineer falling victim to an attack by a robot at a factory near Austin , as reported by various media outlets.\nAccording to the 2021 injury report, the robot, initially designed to maneuver aluminum car parts, reportedly latched its metal claws onto the engineer's back and arm, resulting in a disturbing incident that left a \"trail of blood.\" Witnesses, who shared their accounts with The Information in a story published last month, recounted the unsettling event. The Daily Mail also covered the incident.\nThe occurrence happened while the engineer was engaged in programming software for two disabled Tesla robots in proximity. This development sheds light on concerns regarding the safety protocols within Tesla's manufacturing facilities , prompting further scrutiny.\nIn a separate report from 2022, NewsNation’s Austin affiliate KXAN highlighted allegations of mistreatment of workers at the Tesla facility. The broader context suggests a complex situation at the factory, raising questions about working conditions and employee well-being.\nThe Workers Defense Project has taken a stand on issues related to worker pay and training during the construction of Giga Texas, filing cases with the U.S. Labor Department.\nAccording to the group, numerous workers have approached them, asserting that they did not receive adequate compensation for their work, including regular pay, overtime pay and holiday pay.\nThese collective concerns underscore the challenges facing the workforce at the Tesla facility, prompting investigations into various aspects of employee treatment and workplace practices.",

    "title": "France's Le Pen Faces Verdict That Could End Presidential Hopes | IBTimes",
    "text": "A French court on Monday will rule in the trial of far-right leader Marine Le Pen over an alleged fake jobs scam at the EU parliament, a verdict which could ruin her chances of standing for president in 2027.Three-time presidential candidate Le Pen, who scents her best-ever chance to win the French presidency in 2027, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.But prosecutors in the case, which also targets other top National Rally (RN) officials, have asked the court to issue Le Pen with both a jail sentence and a ban from holding public office.The latter would come into force even if she appeals, disqualifying her from the presidential polls if the court follows the recommendation.With her RN emerging as the single largest party in parliament after the 2024 legislative elections, Le Pen believes she has the momentum to finally take the Elysee in 2027 on the back of public concern over immigration and the cost of living.She was also instrumental in toppling the government of then-prime minister Michel Barnier in a no-confidence vote last year, highlighting her influence.If successful in 2027 she could join a growing number of hard- and far-right leaders around the world ranging from Giorgia Meloni in Italy to Hungary's Viktor Orban.Should she fall, waiting in the wings is her protege and RN party leader Jordan Bardella, just 29, who is not under investigation in the case. But there are doubts even within the party whether he has the experience for a presidential campaign.Le Pen took over as head of the then-National Front (FN) in 2011 but rapidly took steps towards making the party an electoral force and shaking off the legacy of its co-founder and her father Jean-Marie Le Pen who died earlier this year.She renamed it the National Rally and embarked on a policy known as \"dediabolisation\" (de-demonisation) with the stated aim of making it electable for the top job.Besides Le Pen, her party is also in the dock.The RN risks a fine of 4.3 million euros ($4.6 million), less than half of which would be suspended.A total of 24 people are in the dock including nine former members of the European Parliament and their 12 parliamentary assistants.Prosecutors last year asked that Le Pen be given five years in prison -- with three suspended and the two years potentially served outside of jail with a bracelet -- a 300,000 euro ($324,000) fine and a five-year ban on holding office.To the general surprise of observers, they made the unusual request for the ban on holding office to come into force even pending an appeal, a process that might take years.Le Pen had believed that any appeal would have protected her political career regardless of what happened.\"I think the prosecutor's intention is to deprive the French people of the ability to vote for those they wish,\" a shocked Le Pen said after the prosecutors' demands were announced, accusing them of seeking \"my political death\".But prosecutors have insisted there has been no \"harassment\" of the RN.They accuse the party of easing the pressure on the party's own finances by using all of the 21,000 euros monthly allowances to which MEPs were entitled to pay \"fictitious\" parliamentary assistants, who actually worked for the party.They describe the alleged scam as unprecedented, both in terms of its duration from 2004 to 2016 and its scope, with an estimated 4.5 million euros in losses.And prosecutors argue its \"organised\" nature was \"strengthened\" when Marine Le Pen took over as party leader in 2011.The contours of France's 2027 presidential election have yet to be fully outlined.With President Emmanuel Macron unable to stand again, it is far from clear who the strongest candidate will be from the centre and traditional right to succeed him.One possible hopeful, powerful Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, has expressed discomfort at the prospect of his potential rival being disqualified.It would be \"profoundly shocking\" if Le Pen could not stand, he said in November while still a backbencher.© Copyright AFP 2024.
