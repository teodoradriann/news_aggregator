    "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The 23rd World Orchid Conference (WOC) and the 20th Taiwan International Orchid Show (TIOS) coincide, showcasing Taiwan's floral legacy and cultural vibrance. Tainan is set to make history by hosting two prestigious international orchid expos simultaneously. The [23rd WOC](https://en.woc23.com/), often dubbed the “Orchid Olympics,” and the 20th TIOS will dazzle visitors from Feb. 24 to March 10 at the Taiwan Orchid Technology Park and ICC Tainan. This milestone was achieved after 12 years of effort. The 23rd WOC will spotlight Taiwan's orchid conservation, history, research, and applications, while the 20th TIOS promises a vibrant display, incorporating the city's rich culture, myths, gastronomy, and architecture spanning four centuries. During the announcement ceremony on Friday (Feb. 16), Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) [highlighted](https://www.tainan.gov.tw//News_Content.aspx?n=13370&sms=9748&s=8618784#) how the city has transformed the orchid industry into a multifaceted sector that blends horticulture, arts, aesthetics, and smart technologies. These floral extravaganzas coincide with the 400th anniversary of Tainan's founding and are synchronized with the 2024 Taiwan Lantern Festival. Mayor Huang encouraged visitors not to miss the chance to explore Tainan with these spectacular events happening simultaneously. Taiwan boasts a rich variety of orchid plants, with a century-long history of orchid cultivation. The country has been committed to promoting orchid variety rights, investing in orchid certification, and collecting species from around the world. Orchids, accounting for 90% of Taiwan's flower exports, have an annual market value of NT$7 billion (US$223 million), according to the Agriculture and Food Agency.",

    "text": "Notre Dame has suspended its men’s swimming program for at least one year after an external review found numerous violations of NCAA rules prohibiting gambling and that team members failed to “treat one another with dignity and respect,” the school announced Thursday.\n“In order to ensure that this behavior ends and to rebuild a culture of dignity, respect, and exemplary conduct, we have decided to suspend the men’s swimming program for at least one academic year,” athletic director Pete Bevacqua said in a statement.\nBevcaqua said not all team members participated in the poor conduct and that coach Chris Lindauer and his staff fully cooperated with the review.\n“The review found that the staff was not aware of gambling or the scope and extent of other troubling behaviors because team members effectively concealed such behaviors from the coaches and staff through concerted efforts,” Bevacqua said. “According to the review, when the staff became aware of certain isolated incidents of unacceptable conduct, they treated them seriously and professionally.”\nDaniel Boone High School graduate Chris Guiliano, who just finished swimming in the Paris Olympics, is entering his senior season for Notre Dame.\nGuiliano won a gold medal in the Paris games as a member of the U.S. 4 x 100 freestyle relay team and a silver as a member of the 4 x 200 free relay team.\nHe swim in 50, 100 and 200 freestyles at Paris, but did not medal in those events.\nGuiliano was the Atlantic Coast Conference men’s swimmer of the year this past season.\nNotre Dame said that after reports of possible misconduct were reported to administrators, the school brought in the law firm Ropes & Gray to do a review.\nMembers of the team will be permitted to transfer, though NCAA sanctions would follow those found to have broken rules against gambling.\nThe NCAA has modified in recent months its sanctions for gambling violations to make the penalties less punitive for small wagers and those placed on sports outside of those in which the athletes compete.\n“We hope this decision sends a clear and unequivocal message reaffirming that commitment and expectation,” Bevacqua said. “And, as we do after any major action, we will continue to review our internal processes and reporting structures to ensure that we are doing all that we can to nurture a positive experience for all Notre Dame student-athletes.”\nReading Eagle Sports Editor Tom DeSchriver contributed to this story.",

    "title": "Lack Of Funding Strains Toronto Church Still Caring For Refugees | Globalnews.ca - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "It wasn’t long ago that large groups of African asylum seekers could be seen routinely sleeping on the sidewalks outside the City of Toronto’s Streets To Homes assessment and referral centre on Peter Street. The large and sudden influx of migrants in need compounded the pressure on an already-overflowing shelter system. Thousands of those refugees were saved from the streets by volunteers at three Toronto-based churches, Revivaltime Tabernacle, Dominion Church International and Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles.They did what they could to serve hungry refugees, but as the months passed, the expenses became too great to bear for the amount of assistance they received.Revivaltime shut down its shelter operation in September, while Dominion sent its last batch of asylum seekers off to temporary spaces with the help of the federal government shortly before Christmas.Pilgrim Feast Tabernacle continues its effort but on a far smaller scale. Story continues below advertisement “Because no more funds [are] coming, we’re downsizing,” explained Executive Director Nadine Miller.Miller and volunteers have done 15-hour shifts, cooking for, cleaning, feeding and clothing an estimated 1,000-1,500 asylum seekers over the last six months, at times allowing hundreds of them to live inside the small church’s premises. That number is down to just over 30 residents now. Two white buses could be seen outside the church’s front door on Albion Road near Islington Avenue Thursday afternoon. The buses, chartered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada transported just over 50 migrants from Pilgrim Feast to hotels in Niagara Falls. In previous weeks they’ve taken others to temporary spaces in Windsor and Mississauga. Get the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. “The church was never meant to do this,’ said Miller, pointing out that they’ve managed to help care for refugees on a combination of dwindling donations and their own expenditures, which they have been told are not fully reimbursable by the city.“I’m not looking for a medal from the government of Canada, but what I am looking for is financial help … I need the government to decide they want to speak to us. They need our help. We need their help. Let’s work together.”Answering questions via email, City of Toronto spokesperson Russell Baker told Global News, “As of December 17, the City was supporting 11,181 people – 9,370 people in the shelter system and 1,811 people outside the shelter system in bridging hotels and programs supported by the Canadian Red Cross. Of these, 5,372 are refugee claimants – or 48 per cent of the total number of people being supported.” Story continues below advertisement Baker wrote that the City gave Revivaltime, Pilgrim Feast and Dominion $50,000 each in September to help with the costs of the refugee response. Later that month, city council included the latter two churches in a plan to divide $750,000 in funds among 22 eligible community organizations. Related News North Toronto churches sheltering refugees feeling strained Refugees moved out of Toronto churches and into hotels across Ontario “Dominion Church received $140,015 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $190,015,” wrote Baker.“Pilgrim Feast Tabernacles received $235,305 from its reimbursement application, bringing the total they have received to $285,305.”City officials realize that is not enough to fund the churches’ efforts, but say City Hall itself isn’t getting enough from Ottawa.“In December, the City of Toronto received confirmation that $35 million will be paid to the City by the Federal government, which still leaves $165 million in required funding for the City to manage refugee claimant costs … the City continues to call on its federal partners for all remaining 2023 expenses by year-end.”With the arrival of winter, shelter systems around the GTA are full, and alternative programs are struggling. That leaves refugees like Rasidat, who says she came to Pilgrim Feast from Nigeria to flee persecution for her sexual orientation, worrying about the future.“We’re still looking for shelter,” she told Global News, pointing toward her children. Story continues below advertisement “If they don’t [increase funding] I will be outside. Something, I don’t know, might happen to my kids due to the cold outside.”Officials at both Pilgrim Feast and Dominion Church have discussed plans to raise funds for, buy and re-zone property to open up their own shelters for asylum claimants. Pilgrim Feast is hoping to open a space in Toronto, while Dominion is eyeing a spot in Peterborough. Those plans, however, are still in their early stages. &copy 2023 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

    "text": "WACO, Texas - “I mean just today alone I’ve been fed, I got a jacket, I’ve got new socks, and I’m out of the elements of the weather,” said Kenneth Morgan. Like many others, Kenneth Morgan is taking advantage of the several warming centers located in Central Texas. The Salvation Army is one of many opening their doors as we face temperatures below freezing. “Without the Salvation Army yesterday I would have froze here in Waco. they’ve provided me with blankets, they’ve provided me with food, and we get three meals a day,” says Jordan Burns. As temperatures begin to drop, many people are doing all they can to find a place to stay warm. “ I'm thankful for this because if i didn’t have this right now I ’d be out there in the street…freezing. I've been in here 3 hours today and I'm still not all the way thawed out,” said Morgan. The City of Waco and the Waco McLennan county office of emergency management have also opened the doors of the Dewey Community Center. The center is open from 5 p.m. on Sunday January 14th to 12 p.m. on Wednesday January 17th. The center offers cots, blankets, and warm meals for those in the facility. Pets are also welcomed as long as they are crated. The center currently has a capacity of 30 individuals. “ If it gets too crowded I’ll leave. I’ll let somebody else have my spot. I don't mind that. But it seemed like it was meant for me today so I’m here today,” said Morgan.",

    "text": "For any world leader to succeed in implementing their vision, it is essential to consider ground realities as a prerequisite—checking if the plan is workable or not.\nTo start, if a leader chooses the extinction of bodies, murdering the human race, or removing people who disagree with them from the face of the earth, it is a sign of desperation and far less visionary compared to those who have shaped the modern history of the world.\nIdeally, the human brain, the vision one should target to win and achieve objectives, should be the focus rather than resorting to killing and increasing the burden of the task. History shows that without applying this strategy, results were devastating, making the target look negative. One historical example is Hitler and others like him, where their vision, whether good or bad, got buried forever when they passed away.\nLet’s try an unbiased analysis of Narendra Modi, the Indian Prime Minister, known for his radical, unorthodox style of running his party and politics, who has given a different direction to the subcontinent’s political arena. India, once known as a safe haven for all, once a secular state, is now rapidly turning into a proper Hindu state. It is becoming the center stage of aggressive, anti-human policies, burying the vision of India’s forefathers who had other ideas for a progressive Hindustan.\nBefore becoming Prime Minister, Modi was banned from the USA for nearly a decade. The 2005 decision was based on deadly riots against minority Muslims in the Indian state of Gujarat, where Modi was the Chief Minister. The US State Department invoked a little-known law passed in 1998, making foreign officials responsible for “severe violations of religious freedom” ineligible for visas. Modi was the only person ever denied a visa to the US under this provision, as confirmed by US officials.\nModi’s numerous steps for implementing his BJP policies (basically RSS vision) need scrutiny. One of which is when he decided to erect a statue of Subhas Chandra Bose, a controversial figure, in a pride of place in New Delhi’s gate. There is little doubt that Bose was a huge admirer of Hitler and a pawn of axis powers. Being the founder of the free Indian legion, which was formed in Germany from 3000 Indian prisoners who had fought with the British, Bose swore an oath of allegiance both to Hitler and India.\nBose, while in Tokyo, headed the Indian National Army, recruited mostly after the fall of Singapore, that fought with the Japanese Imperial army in the jungles of Burma.\nA question can be asked: why a statue of Bose and not of Nehru or Gandhi? A Prime Minister should think and act above all personal or political agendas. It’s a national agenda that takes priority.\nLately, there has been a boom in the sale of Hitler’s biography Mein Kampf in India. At certain institutions, on the direction of RSS, the book is taken as a reference for teaching how to become a leader, particularly in Modi’s days. Hitler is considered a hero, a bit of a surprise as Hitler ruthlessly executed Jews, who are now very close to Modi. Modi’s closeness to Jews and Israel is no hidden secret. It may be a need of the hour, but it is certainly a contradiction in approach.\nThe RSS was formed in the 1920s on the model of Mussolini’s black shirts, running on pure extreme views of “do or die” to implement fascism. The founder ensured it used the sword as a means of conquest, not the table. M.S. Golwalkar, the former Head of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the parent organization of Modi’s BJP, was an overt fan of Hitler. Golwalkar frequently praised Nazi Germany, wrote in 1939 about the choice of facing India’s non-Hindu population (chiefly Muslims and Christians). “Either to merge themselves in the national race and adopt its culture or live at its mercy so long as the national race may allow them to do or quit the country at the sweet will of the national race.”\nOn the evening of January 30, 1948, Nathuram Vinayak Godse shot Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi dead at point-blank range. A year after the assassination, a trial court sentenced Godse to death, and he was executed in November 1949.\nBefore joining the Hindu Mahasabha, Godse was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is a long-time member of the 95-year-old mothership of Hindu nationalism. The RSS plays a deeply influential role in his government and outside. For decades, the RSS has shunned Godse, who murdered the “Father of the Nation.” Yet, a group of Hindu right-wingers in recent years.\nFarasat Latif\nThe writer is a retired civil servant of Pakistan.

    "text": "Fabienne Verdier’s spiritual-truth-seeking œuvre has found its way in the art market[29 Dec 2023] Veritable breaths of fresh air in today’s creative universe, Fabienne Verdier’s almost minimalist works are being revalued on the auction market. At the beginning of 2023, Fabienne Verdier enjoyed a major exhibition of her work that was mounted in dialogue with the superb collection of Old and Modern masters in Colmar’s Unterlinden Museum. The exhibition presented a large number of new paintings inspired by her exchanges with her astrophysicist friend Trinh Xuan Thuan. Under the title Le Chant des étoiles (The Songs of the Stars), the exhibition gave birth to her series Rainbow-paintings, inspired by the chromatic palette that Grünewald used to depict the Resurrection on the back of the famous Isenheim altarpiece, a work that celebrates light and energy waves. By allowing herself to be inspired by great artists and the major astrophysical forces that shape our universe, [Fabienne VERDIER](https://www.artprice.com/artist/238596/fabienne-verdier) contributes to the perpetual mutation of forms. Her work appears to continue the pictorial and philosophical dialogue initiated by Chinese artist Zao Wou Ki, the first artist to achieve a true symbiosis between China and the West. Having absorbed the essence of Chinese calligraphy in her younger years, Fabienne Verdier steers this artform into other paths, with new techniques and a positively contemporary spirit. Fabienne Verdier’s annual turnover at auction (copyright Artprice.com) A ten years quest for the sources of calligraphy Fabienne Verdier expressed her desire to become a painter at a very early age, but against the wishes of her parents. They tried to discourage her, but the young woman had already demonstrated solid motivation coupled with a highly disciplined nature that would ultimately make her journey an extraordinary one. After shining as a brilliant student at the Toulouse School of Fine Arts, she went through a period of profound self-questioning to the point that she refused to continue her studies in Paris. Against the backdrop of the constant need for innovation that animated the 1980s, Verdier was about to abandon art altogether when the city of Toulouse signed a twin-town agreement with Chongqing, in Sichuan. Fabienne Verdier asked to be sent there with the aim of being introduced to Chinese pictorial and calligraphic art. It was 1983 when she became the first Western student accepted into communist China. However, she did not find what she was looking for in official Chinese education where Socialist Realism and its formatted painting dominated. The cultural revolution destroyed what it could of ancestral Chinese traditions, even cutting off the hands of calligraphers. The young painter did not give up, however, and as soon as she began to master Mandarin and Sichuanese she began looking for a teacher who matched her aspirations. The last practitioners of China’s millennial calligraphic traditions were very elderly Chinese, reluctant to welcome a young Western woman into their workshops. Deprived of his hands by the revolutionaries, the first Master she met directed her towards another who initially refused categorically to transmit his knowledge. Fabienne Verdier’s persistence finally conquered the heart of Master Huang Yuan, who took her under his wing. The teachings of Master Huang Yuan involved a long period of asceticism for the young painter. For ten years, he forced her to work on the different nuances of black and the exact copying of nomenclatures and texts in order to understand the techniques, but also the spirit of the Ancients. Calligraphy is a philosophy nourished by a Taoist relationship with the world: it aims at the line of truth where gesture and matter merge in the unity of the living being. It is a long and rigorous initiation which completely changes one’s outlook on things. Back in France, Fabienne Verdier found a path to her own form of abstraction that without remaining in the Chinese tradition, retains the quest for essential truths and simplicity, for elegance and a sense of the sacred. She decided to adopt modern tools, working on linen canvases, using color with Titian greens and Piero della Francesca blues and she constructed gigantic horsehair brushes which give her paintings an exceptional vigor and dynamism. To make this heavy tool easier to handle once saturated with paint, the artist grafted the handlebars of her bicycle onto it. Above a canvas placed on the ground, she fluidly controls the giant brush guided by the energy of her entire body set in motion. It is like a dance above the canvas that transforms her movements into abstract shapes, both simple and yet complex. Fabienne Verdier’s Global Ranking at auction An œuvre that is at last being recognised on the international auction market Entirely absorbed by the rigors of her creative activities, Fabienne Verdier has focused little attention on art market emergence strategies. At the beginning of the 2000s, she was supported by the Alice Pauli and Jaeger Bucher galleries, but her works remained confidential, and were completely absent from the auction sphere. However, several French museums, including the Cernuschi Museum and the Pompidou Center became interested and acquired some of her works for their permanent collections in 2003 and 2007 respectively. Today, Fabienne Verdier is still only marginally present in auction sales outside France, but this could change because her work is starting to gain international recognition: In 2018 Sotheby’s in Hong Kong managed to sell one of her paintings above the $100,000 threshold and for the artist’s very first appearance in an American sale, her painting [Cercie – Ascese (from Silencieuse Coincidence)](/artist/238596/fabienne-verdier/painting/29328600/cercie-ascese-from-silencieuse-coincidence) fetched $151,200 on 15 March this year (at Leslie Hindman in Chicago). Geography of Verdier’s turnover at auction (copyright Artprice.com) In addition, the French market has, this year, hammered a new auction record for Fabienne Verdier at $431,200 for a painting entitled [Ascèse](/artist/238596/fabienne-verdier/painting/30491538/ascese) (2006). This summit marks an important milestone because, in addition to doubling her previous record, it raises her to ninth place among the most successful French Contemporary artists (born after 1945 according to the Artprice classification) at auction (in terms of annual auction turnover). French Contemporary artists are usually less expensive than their American, English or Chinese counterparts, and Fabienne Verdier is one of the rare French artists whose works fetch more than $100,000. Her popularity has built up over time, far from the speculative desires of the market, thanks to the involvement of galleries which now distribute her work in six different countries: the Custot gallery promotes her work in London and Dubai, the Lelong gallery in Paris and New York, the Alice Pauli gallery in Lausanne and the Derom gallery in Brussels. This international network appears to be essential for building a solid price standing. Here again, patience seems to be the key.",
