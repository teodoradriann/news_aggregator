    "text": "Colombia ha sabido aprovechar el Tratado de Libre Comercio (TLC) con Estados Unidos . Así lo manifestó Ricardo Triana , director Ejecutivo del Consejo de Empresas Americanas (CEA Colombia) , quien resaltó que la inversión directa de Estados Unidos en el país ha aumentado significativamente, pasando de USD2.476 millones en 2005 a USD5.768 millones en 2023, lo que representa un crecimiento del 132,95 %.“Colombia es un socio estratégico y atractivo para la inversión estadounidense , ya que Estados Unidos solo tiene 14 acuerdos de libre comercio con 20 países en el mundo y tenemos el privilegio de ser uno de ellos”, resaltó Triana.Asimismo, recordó que las exportaciones colombianas a Estados Unidos han aumentado considerablemente desde la entrada en vigor del TLC en 2012 .“Aunque es importante tener en cuenta que desde el 2020, el covid-19 ha impuesto retos a la economía a nivel global, por lo que las cifras de los últimos años han fluctuado, esperamos que las exportaciones tengan un crecimiento sostenido a medida que se siguen estabilizando los mercados ”, sostuvo.Agregó que para dinamizar aún más la vocación exportadora de Colombia , se deben considerar varios aspectos.“En primer lugar, es necesario continuar diversificando la canasta exportadora de Colombia . Si bien otros sectores como el textil , agrícola e industrial han tenido un crecimiento sostenido, Colombia debería aprovechar el acceso preferencial al mercado estadounidense para impulsar la exportación de productos con mayor valor agregado, como bienes manufacturados y servicios. Esto le permitiría a Colombia reducir su dependencia de las exportaciones de productos primarios y minero-energéticos, que son más vulnerables a las fluctuaciones de los precios internacionales”, resaltó el director de CEA Colombia. Añade que es importante apoyar a las empresas colombianas , especialmente las pequeñas y medianas, para que puedan desarrollar su competitividad y aprovechar aún más las oportunidades que brinda el TLC.“Esto implica inversiones en innovación , desarrollo de capacidades, acceso a financiamiento y fortalecimiento de las cadenas de valor. Asimismo, es importante simplificar los trámites y procedimientos de exportación para facilitar la participación de más empresas en el comercio bilateral”, puntualizó.Y es que de acuerdo con el estudio realizado por la Cámara Colombo Americana, AmCham Colombia , con motivo del doceavo aniversario del acuerdo, se destacan 748 productos diferentes a los agrícolas que además de aumentar su cuota en el mercado estadounidense en 492 % por el orden de USD1,748 millones en el tiempo señalado, cuentan con oportunidades para continuar aprovechando el acuerdo bilateral.Dentro de los productos de manufacturas que más han incrementado sus exportaciones hacia Estados Unidos desde que el acuerdo comercial entró en vigencia se encuentran puertas y ventanas, equipos eléctricos, autopartes y partes de avión y/o helicópteros, productos de cartón , prendas de vestir como vestidos de baño, ropa interior femenina y camisetas; utensilios de cocina y globos de látex , entre otros.“El TLC con Estados Unidos aún tiene mucho potencial por explorar y aprovechar. Es importante ver que hay 748 productos de manufacturas que han aumentado sus exportaciones hacia ese país, más allá del sector agroindustrial que tradicionalmente ha sido uno de los sectores con mayor aprovechamiento del acuerdo comercial”, dijo María Claudia Lacouture, presidenta de la Cámara Colombo Americana, AmCham Colombia .Agregó que “el llamado es a reforzar los esfuerzos para mejorar la competitividad y productividad de las empresas en Colombia , más en el contexto que tiene el país en 2024 en donde tenemos un desafío de crecimiento importante en donde las oportunidades que ofrece el TLC ayudarán en el proceso de reactivación económica ”.",

    "text": "[caption id=\"attachment_3700745\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"900\"] Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury[\\/caption] Love Island UK alum Molly-Mae Hague is turning to fans following her split from Tommy Fury, but she doesn't \"ever plan\" on spilling all the tea. The 25-year-old shared her post-breakup perspective in a new YouTube vlog uploaded Thursday, August 29. \"I feel like a lot of you will have probably clicked onto this video because you want me to sit down and talk about everything that's gone on [in] the last couple of weeks ... and explain what's been happening,\" she said. \"But to be honest with you, that was never something that was ever going to happen.\" She continued, \"The last two weeks have been very, very real and it's real life, and it's something that we've been going through as privately as we can, but obviously not privately whatsoever.\" Hague explained that \"that last thing\" she'd want is to \"fuel\" more drama and speculation regarding her personal life by sharing the details of her breakup. \"It's just not my coping mechanism,\" she added. \"My coping mechanism for the last couple of weeks is talking to the people that I love and [who] are so close to me and that have been so incredible through this time.\" [ami-related id=\"3341974\" pwaid=\"3341974\" url=\"https:\\/\\/www.usmagazine.com\\/celebrity-news\\/news\\/love-islands-tommy-fury-and-molly-mae-hagues-relationship-timeline\\/\" title=\"Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague's Relationship Timeline\" hiddentitle=\"Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague's Relationship Timeline\" target=\"\" thumb=\"true\" imgsrc=\"\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2023\\/07\\/Tommy-Fury-and-Molly-Mae-Hague-s-Relationship-Timeline-From-Love-Island-U.K.-to-Parenthood-347.jpg?quality=86&strip=all\" imgid=\"3341962\" format=\"standard\" flag=\"\" channel=\"1\" showpromotitle=\"true\"] The reality star noted that she wants to keep \"pushing forward,\" saying, \"I don't really ever plan on talking about the last couple of weeks. It's just not something that I feel comfortable with.\" [caption id=\"attachment_3700744\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"900\"] Molly-Mae Hague[\\/caption] Though she acknowledged that fans will \"want to know what's going on,\" Hague also emphasized, \"This is real life. It is not drama, it is not tea, it is not a publicity stunt. ... It's very sad and it's very deep.\" Hague reminded her followers that she's not the only one involved in the situation. \"I'm an oversharer in some aspects of my life, but other things I do think it's important to just deal with privately,\" she said. \"Also out of respect to Tommy as well, because it's just not nice and I feel like everything over the last couple of weeks has really been a lot. ... For me, the best way to deal with this is just to move forward.\" Hague announced her split from Fury, 25, on August 14 after five years together. \"Never in a million years did I think I’d ever have to write this. ... I am extremely upset to announce that mine and Tommy's relationship has come to an end,\" she wrote via her Instagram Story. \"I will forever be grateful for the most important thing to me now and always, my beautiful daughter. Without us there would be no her, she will always be my priority.\" The former couple met during season 5 of Love Island UK in 2019, finishing the reality series in second place. Hague announced her pregnancy in September 2022, giving birth to the pair's daughter, Bambi, the following January. [caption id=\"attachment_3700743\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"683\"] Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague[\\/caption] \"I want to thank you all for the love you have shown us over the last five years. You have all been a part of our journey and I feel it's right to share this with you all,\" Hague told her fans earlier this month. \"Whilst I attempt to navigate the coming days and weeks please kindly respect my privacy over this difficult time, I'll be back when it feels right.\" [ami-related id=\"2133576\" pwaid=\"2133576\" url=\"https:\\/\\/www.usmagazine.com\\/entertainment\\/pictures\\/love-island-u-k-couples-still-together-where-are-they-now\\/\" title=\"‘Love Island U.K.’ Couples: Where Are They Now?\" hiddentitle=\"‘Love Island U.K.’ Couples: Where Are They Now?\" target=\"\" thumb=\"true\" imgsrc=\"\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/Love-Island-UK-Couples-Still-Together6.jpg?quality=70&strip=all\" imgid=\"2133541\" format=\"gallery\" flag=\"\" channel=\"9\" showpromotitle=\"true\"] Fury addressed the duo's split in a statement of his own on August 14, saying he was \"heartbroken\" by the breakup. He later denied being unfaithful after cheating rumors ran rampant online. \"Tommy is horrified by the false allegations of cheating being circulated by the media and he’s consulting his lawyers,\" a spokesperson told the U.K.'s Mirror on August 16. Amid the speculation, a woman named Milla Corfixen initially denied kissing Fury, but she later came forward with claims that the twosome did lock lips. \"I didn't even know who he was,\" she alleged via her Instagram Story on Sunday, August 25, per the Mirror. Corfixen insisted that \"nothing else happened\" between her and Fury and claimed she \"never would have kissed him back\" if she'd \"known\" about his relationship with Hague. Fury has not yet addressed Corfixen's claims, but Us Weekly previously reached out to his rep for comment.",

    "text": "Bigg Boss 18 contestant Chahat Pandey didn't win the trophy, nor did she win fans' hearts. The actor faced massive backlash for tarnishing Avinash Mishra's image on the show. It all started when Chahat's mother entered the show as part of 'Family Week.' During her brief stint, Chahat's mother bashed Avinash for allegedly accusing her daughter. She went on to say several things about him, calling him a flirt and claiming his family would never forgive him. She advised Chahat not to work with Avinash.\nNot only that, Chahat's mother also called Avinash a \"womaniser.\" She strongly voiced her opinion, stating that Chahat is such a well-mannered and obedient daughter that she would marry a blind man if her parents wanted her to. This all stemmed from rumors that Chahat was dating her co-star from a previous show.\nChahat Pandey refuses to forgive Avinash Mishra\nOn Wednesday, Chahat Pandey went live on her official Instagram account and answered fans' questions. When a fan asked if she was in touch with Avinash, she replied, \"I'm not in touch with Avinash and would never work with him.\"\nAnother fan asked if she would consider working with Avinash Mishra in the future. Chahat said, \"100 crores de, 500 crores de, 1 crore de, toh bhi mein Avinash ke sath kaam nahi karungi\" : Even if I was promised Rs 100 - 500 crores, I would never work with him because of what he did in the Bigg Boss house. I will never forgive him because he lied and told things without proof, which were proven incorrect after the program ended. He also spoke about my character, and I'll never forget that.'\nChahat's statement sparked fury among netizens, with many accusing her of being self-obsessed. Some even advised her to move on from Avinash, pointing out that Bigg Boss 18 is over and that the feud should come to an end.\nA user mentioned, \"Sister firstly who is going to cast you for 1 crore . And madam BB is over, and here you are still playing BB and seeking footage from Avinash.\"\nAnother mentioned, \"Can't she get over Avinash?..\"\nThe third one said, \"I never saw #AvinashMishra crying regarding biggboss matters, talking ill about others, or playing sympathy par kuch contestant ka BiggBoss khatam he nhi ho raha hai. Still living in the BB zone. I like how positive Avinash is after coming out bb.\"\nAbout Chahat Pandey\nShe is best known for her performance in Dangal's most successful show, Nath, where she was the lead, the actress has also been part of many successful shows like Hamari Bahu Silk, Durga – Mata Ki C\nhhaya and Nath.",

    "title": "How the Hell Is Apple’s Two-Week-Old MacBook Pro on Sale Already?",
    "text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Let me finish stamping my feet for a moment. Almost done. Ok, there. You see, I just purchased this exact MacBook Pro M4 Pro from the Apple Store two weeks ago on November 8, when it was released. Waiting didn’t even cross my mind because it was so brand-spanking-new. Black Friday Apple deals come for old stock, not the latest. So forgive me if I feel like a bit of a sucker. I can’t go back in time to warn myself to wait for Black Friday, Back of the Future style, but I can sound the VICE air raid siren to alert y’all to a killer deal on a killer laptop on sale for $1,750. That’s a solid $250 discount. In fact, I’m typing this (and all my share of VICE’s Black Friday coverage) on it right now. It’s a sweetheart of a laptop, and it looks damn fine in Space Black. Not just the base level of the new MacBook Pro, this deal is for the mid-tier version with the M4 Pro chip. It ups the ante from three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports to three Thunderbolt 5 (USB-C) ports, in addition to the lovely MagSafe 3 charging port that lets you plug in the adapter without siphoning away one of those useful peripheral ports. The 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU, coupled with 24 GB of RAM, provides scads of oomph for powering through intensive programs and tasks, such as video editing. There’s a fan that does a stellar job at keeping the chassis cool under heavy loads. If you’ve been clinging on to the last iteration of Apple’s Intel-powered MacBook Pro like I was, the shift to Apple’s M4 for even banal tasks will feel seismic. Mere internet browsing and Word document writing was never slow, but with this it’s so fast it’s almost telepathic. The 512 GB solid state drive is all the memory I personally need on an internal drive. For truly large projects and document preservation, I hook up an external SSD. The Samsung T9 is my choice, if you’re looking for one of those, by the way. If you’ve got a MacBook Pro M3, you probably don’t need to upgrade. If you have a particularly souped-up and optioned-out MacBook Pro M2 Pro or M2 Max, you might be fine sticking with that, too. But for anybody else, the shift to the M4 Pro is worth it , and I heartily recommend it.",
