    "text": "Hamas says it is considering in a \"positive spirit\" a Gaza truce deal, while the UN warned rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory would require efforts not seen since World War II.After months of stop-start negotiations, Hamas has sounded an optimistic tone about the latest hostages-for-ceasefire proposal, raising hopes an agreement may soon be reached -- even as medics in the besieged strip reported fresh strikes on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah on Friday.Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group will \"soon\" send a delegation to Egypt to complete ongoing ceasefire discussions with a deal that \"realises the demands of our people\".Haniyeh, the leader of the militant group's political wing, told Egyptian and Qatari mediators in calls on Thursday that Hamas was studying the latest proposal from Israel with a \"positive spirit\".The stakes of the truce talks were thrown into sharp relief Thursday, when a UN report estimated it could take 80 years to reconstruct all the homes flattened over the course of the nearly seven-month war.\"The scale of the destruction is huge and unprecedented... this is a mission that the global community has not dealt with since World War II,\" Abdallah al-Dardari, the UNDP's Regional Director for Arab States told a briefing in Jordan.The UNDP assessment forecast the socioeconomic toll inflicted will cost generations of Palestinians to come and called for an urgent ceasefire.The only truce mediators have been able to hammer out so far was a week-long deal in November, that saw the release of 105 hostages for 240 Palestinian prisoners.Israel estimates that 129 captives seized by the militants during their October 7 attack remain in Gaza.The military says 35 of them are dead, including 49-year-old Dror Or.The government confirmed Or's death early Friday. Two of his children were among the hostages released during the November truce.Hamas and Israel have been at loggerheads for months over the terms of any new deal.The militant group has demanded a permanent ceasefire to end the war and the withdrawal of troops, which Israel has refused.While Israel faces regular protests demanding the government bring home remaining captives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight on.With or without a truce, he has said he will send ground troops into Rafah, despite global concerns over the fate of around 1.5 million civilians sheltering there.The truce offer under consideration includes a 40-day halt to fighting and the exchange of Israeli hostages for potentially thousands of Palestinian prisoners, according to details released by Britain.During his latest whirlwind visit to the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the Palestinian group to accept what he termed an \"extraordinarily generous\" deal on the part of Israel.\"If Hamas actually purports to care about the Palestinian people and wants to see an immediate alleviation of their suffering, it will take the deal,\" Blinken told reporters Wednesday.Until Haniyeh's comments, Gaza-rulers Hamas had indicated a generally negative reception of the proposed truce.The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.UNDP estimated that as of April 12, at least five percent of Gaza's population had been killed or injured.\"The suffering in Gaza will not end when the war does,\" UNDP chief Achim Steiner said.\"Unprecedented levels of human losses, capital destruction, and the steep rise in poverty in such a short period of time will precipitate a serious development crisis,\" he added.The humanitarian crisis and rising death toll in Gaza have prompted demonstrations around the world, including in universities in the United States, Canada and France.Israeli President Isaac Herzog slammed the protests, charging that the US universities had been \"contaminated by hatred and anti-Semitism\".Colombia severed diplomatic ties with Israel on Wednesday, while Turkey on Thursday announced it was suspending trade.Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants are threatened by famine, but international aid has only been able to trickle in.Under US pressure, Israel has allowed increased aid deliveries in recent days, including through a reopened border crossing.US charity World Central Kitchen resumed delivering food to starving Gazans this week, after it had suspended operations following an Israeli strike in April that killed seven of its staffers.\"We realised after the kitchen closed that many mouths were left hungry,\" kitchen manager Zakria Yahya Abukuwaik said, while preparing food in Rafah.© Copyright AFP 2023.

    "title": "Sanders Files to Force First-Ever Vote in Congress on Blocking Weapons to Israel",
    "text": "\\u003E On Wednesday, Sanders introduced six resolutions blocking six sales of different weapons contained within the $20 billion weapons deal announced by the Biden administration in August. The sales include many of the types of weapons that Israel has used in its relentless campaign of extermination in Gaza over the past year. \\n\\n\\u003E “Sending more weapons is not only immoral, it is also illegal. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act lay out clear requirements for the use of American weaponry – Israel has egregiously violated those rules,” said Sanders. “There is a mountain of documentary evidence demonstrating that these weapons are being used in violation of U.S. and international law.”\\n\\n\\u003E This will be the first time in history that Congress has ever voted on legislation to block a weapons sale to Israel, as the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project pointed out. This is despite the U.S. having sent Israel over $250 billion in military assistance in recent decades, according to analyst Stephen Semler, as Israel has carried out ethnic cleansings and massacres across Palestine and in Lebanon.\\n\\n\\u003E The resolutions are not likely to pass; even if they did pass the heavily pro-Israel Congress, they would likely be vetoed by President Joe Biden, who has been insistent on sending weapons to Israel with no strings attached.\\n\\n\\u003E However, Sanders’s move is in line with public opinion. Polls have consistently found that the majority of the public supports an end to Israel’s genocide; a poll by the Institute for Global Affairs [released this week](https:\\u002F\\u002Finstituteforglobalaffairs.org\\u002F2024\\u002F09\\u002Fvox-populi-battlegrounds\\u002F#full-report) found, for instance, that a majority of Americans think the U.S. should stop supporting Israel or make support contingent on Israeli officials’ agreement to a ceasefire deal. This includes nearly 80 percent of Democrats.",

    "text": "Among Loudoun residents and businesses there is widespread participation in the county’s program for recycling paper, cardboard, metal, plastic and glass containers and 11 other types of inorganic materials. However, local recycling of organic (plant and animal) waste is another story. Although many Loudouners support reducing the amount of organic matter that is simply discarded, there is relatively little collection of that material for composting.\nAn informal survey of five restaurants, two supermarkets, and 30 residents, revealed that all food scraps from these sources ended up buried in the Loudoun County landfill. This result suggests that most restaurants and businesses with food services are not participating in a program or process that diverts food scraps and organic material to composting. Such inaction needs to be corrected through creation of a robust composting program which will generate real, measurable economic and environmental benefits.\nAs part of the county’s waste management process, diverting food waste from the county landfill into an active compost creation process will produce compost which can be returned as a soil amendment to maintain our nutrient-rich soils while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (methane and carbon dioxide). Importantly, because composting results in less material to bury and manage, landfill maintenance expenses will be lowered, and consequently, tax dollars saved. Using compost as a soil amendment will enable resiliency to flood and drought conditions, promote better crop yields, and reduce the need for chemical amendments (synthetic fertilizers and pesticides), thereby lowering the risk of water pollution from rainfall and irrigation runoff.\nThe Composting Process\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, compost is created by “Combining organic wastes, such as food, yard trimmings, and manures in the right ratios into piles, rows, or vessels; [and] by adding bulking agents such as wood chips, as necessary to accelerate the breakdown of organic materials, and allowing the finished material to fully stabilize and mature through a curing process.”\nCommercial or industrial composting takes place in a large-scale facility designed to handle up to 80,000 tons per year. During this process, large contaminants such as non-biodegradable plastics are removed prior to placing nitrogen-rich materials into a sludge generator; leaves, paper and tree branches are added to this mixture to maintain suitable carbon to nitrogen ratios. This mixture then is placed into long rows which are automatically watered and mixed daily. After three to six months, a dark compost product emerges to be added to farms and home gardens, enriching their soils.\nIndividuals who participate in backyard composting place their appropriate food scraps and other organic matter, like leaves and coffee grounds, into heaps or bins. These accumulations—which, except for egg shells, should not include food scraps derived from animals—are turned and managed manually throughout the year, ultimately becoming a dark compost product for combining with garden soil.\nThe State of Composting in Loudoun\nThe big news is the recent announcement that the Loudoun landfill has opened a drop-off center for accepting food waste and the other ingredients for composting. There is a limit of five gallons per week per donor. A business named Key City Compost will collect the material and take it to its processing facility in Frederick, MD. Once created, the compost is sold to farmers and gardeners. The Board of Supervisors approved this process as part of the county energy strategy. Because the program is on a one-year trial basis, it is important that residents and businesses know about it and use the opportunity so it will be extended to close a major gap in Loudoun’s waste management services.\nLocally, there already are some good companies and residents that merit a “shout out” for showing the way to compost.\nThe two Wegmans stores in Loudoun County divert their food waste to the Free State Farms commercial composting facility in Prince William County.\nWorm Works, a Loudoun-based company, provides commercial and household composting services. The Worm Works team transports collected food waste to a compost farm in Middleburg, where the collected food waste is transformed into nutrient-dense compost.\nSome Loudoun residents retrieve nitrogen-rich coffee grounds from Starbucks to be used in their gardens and home compost heaps. In 1995, Starbucks started its international “Grounds for Your Garden” program, which allows home gardeners to retrieve coffee grounds, on a first-come-first-served basis. Starbucks locations at Pipeline Plaza and Broadlands Boulevard in Ashburn participate in this program.\nChef Jorge Chicas, of Farm & Fork Kitchen in Ashburn, and the Hamilton Mercantile store both are actively composting their food waste.\nIncreasing Composting in Loudoun\nLoudoun businesses and residents have a wonderful opportunity to collaboratively reduce wastefulness by redirecting organic materials away from landfills to composting facilities. County organizations could substantially aid accomplishment of that goal. For example, the chambers of commerce could advocate that their members engage in, or promote, composting. The Virginia Master Gardeners, an avid proponent of composting, makes speakers on the subject available to home gardening groups. Other non-governmental organizations and the County itself could provide training opportunities demonstrating how to make compost work. Such measures should improve Loudoun’s effective recycling rate, and with a dedicated populace, ultimately attain the status of zero-waste community. Just the efficient transformation of food waste, a useless, burdensome entity, to compost, a valuable, useful product, is reason enough to pursue the process. But, as noted, there are other highly significant reasons for composting in the form of tangible benefits to the economy and environment. With public participation and support, all these benefits can be realized. There is no downside to composting.\nDerrick Clarke, a resident of Ashburn, is CEO and co-founder of AgriCair, a nonprofit dedicated to the maintenance of our “One Living System” through soil and water advocacy.

El chubasquito de anoche en Huelva dejó 18 gotas y 20 gramos de arena del desierto\".\nNo os asustéis cuando esta mañana vayáis a recoger vuestro coche y os lo encontréis en esta situación.El chubasquito de anoche en Huelva dejó 18 gotas y 20 gramos de arena del desierto. pic.twitter.com/ikjBNKtx0Q\n— MeteoHuelva.es (@Meteohuelva) March 22, 2024\nLa lluvia de barro ha alertado especialmente a todos los cofrades, que han puesto el grito en el cielo al pensar en el aspecto que lucirían tras el polvo en suspensión los palcos recién colocados en la Carrera Oficial, tras haber colocado las telas.\nLas telas en los palcos de la Carrera Oficial recién colocadas Las telas en los palcos de la Carrera Oficial recién colocadas / M.G. (Huelva)\nSin embargo, al parecer se ha quedado en un susto, ya que tal y como ha podido comprobar Huelva Información, no se han visto afectados. Según la predicción de la Aemet, esta situación nos acompañará al menos hasta el próximo Domingo de Ramos, cuando se registren cielos con nubes medias y altas, también con polvo en suspensión y sin descartar precipitaciones débiles y dispersas , acompañadas de depósitos de barro, más probables a partir de la tarde.\nCoches llenos de barro en la calle Roque Barcia Coches llenos de barro en la calle Roque Barcia / Alberto Domínguez (Huelva)\nEl tiempo a partir del domingo A partir de la jornada dominical, las temperaturas comenzarán a descender en la mitad oriental y habrá pocos cambios en el resto de la provincia. Los vientos soplarán de componente este, moderados a fuertes en el litoral mediterráneo y flojos a moderados en el resto. Tendremos rachas muy fuertes en el área del Estrecho y litoral mediterráneo oriental.\nY este episodio de calima no acaba hoy, al revés.La situación de la Dana entre Canarias y la Península seguirá impulsando aire directamente desde el desierto del Sáhara durante hoy y todo el fin de semana. Las posibles lluvias que se esperan para el domingo por la noche… pic.twitter.com/txebpGJn8Z\n— MeteoHuelva.es (@Meteohuelva) March 22, 2024\nA partir del lunes la situación se complica, ya que tendremos una probabilidad de precipitación de casi el 100% en las primeras horas del día y de en torno al 30% por la tarde, lo que mantendrá en vilo a los pasos que salen en Carrera Oficial.\n¿Por qué se produce la lluvia de barro? Según eltiempo.es, La lluvia de barro es un fenómeno característico en España principalmente de la vertiente Mediterránea (aunque puede darse en otras zonas), y en ocasiones se la conoce con el nombre de lluvia de sangre o «lluvia de fango» por el color rojizo que puede llegar a dejar el polvo mezclado con agua al impactar sobre diferentes superficies.\nLa lluvia de barro es un tipo de lluvia (o de precipitación) que arrastra polvo mineral que termina depositándose en el suelo u otras superficies, dando la sensación de que han sido salpicadas por barro.\n¿Qué es la lluvia de barro? ¿Qué se necesita para que llueva barro? Para que llueva barro debe producirse un contraste de temperaturas entre el suelo y las capas medias y altas de nuestra atmósfera . La temperatura en el suelo, más alta, levanta las masas de aire arrastrando polvo hasta niveles altos de la troposfera.\nEn este «viaje», y para que se produzca lluvia de barro, el aire cálido debe chocar con otro más frío. Si se eleva más y choca con algún frente que se encuentre en la zona caerá de nuevo a la superficie en forma de lluvia de barro.",

    "text": "It took that, a blunder by the opposing goalkeeper, for Paris Saint-Germain to win on an evening when its attackers were lacking in front of goal. The capital club won its first Champions League match of the season on Wednesday, September 18, against Girona (1-0), thanks to a stroke of luck in the last minute of the match. A ball that slipped from the gloves of Paulo Gazzaniga, the Girona goalkeeper, went under his legs and into the goal. Exultation and relief could mingle in the din of the Parc des Princes. Read also | PSG-Girona: the summary of the Parisians’ sluggish but victorious start in the Champions League Add to your selections The biggest continental competition was making its return to the Parisian setting, but the feeling was completely different. No tifo or atmosphere of the big European evenings, because the Auteuil bend, where the members of the Ultras Paris collective give the there in the stands, was closed. A UEFA sanction following the use of smoke bombs during the C1 semi-final against Borussia Dortmund on May 7. On the pitch, too, PSG did not display the European face expected of it. Throughout the entire match, the Parisian attackers forgot to activate the Champions League mode, where the level is higher than in Ligue 1, which the capital club already dominates, with sixteen goals scored in four victories. This convincing start to the season had validated the direction taken by Luis Enrique and his management: a less bling-bling team, with a marked playing identity and more focused on the collective. A more consistent second period The transition after the departure of Kylian Mbappé, who scored 44 goals last season, has therefore started smoothly. The danger in attack must now come from everywhere and the reception of Girona, who were playing the first Champions League match in their history, was a good opportunity to prove it. Especially since the club arrived weighed down by uncertainties, having been swept away last weekend by FC Barcelona (1-4). Apart from a few minutes at the start of the second half – marked by a save by PSG’s Russian goalkeeper, Matvey Safonov, on a header from Cristhian Stuani (52e) –, Girona did not worry Paris. But Luis Enrique’s players were lacking offensively. The first period was a failure, like the performance of Bradley Barcola, who has been in decline for two games. “The first half was difficult, but I liked the second, where we were infinitely superior”Luis Enrique said. Read also | In addition to changing its competition, UEFA has modified the Champions League anthem Add to your selections This second half was indeed more consistent, more lively too (20 shots), but it remained marked by the glaring Parisian inefficiency. This fault recalled the performances of the French team during the Euro, in which Ousmane Dembélé participated. The 27-year-old winger had set the target in recent weeks (four goals, three assists in six matches). Against Girona, he distinguished himself by his lack of efficiency, shooting eight times, but too often wide. You have 44.91% of this article left to read. The rest is reserved for subscribers.",
