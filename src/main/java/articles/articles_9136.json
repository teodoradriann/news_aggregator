    "text": "Itchy Breasts: Unraveling Causes and Seeking Solutions\nBoston Bruins’ Brandon Carlo Returns Post-Concussion, Adapts Gameplay to Safeguard Health\nIn a significant development for the Boston Bruins, defenseman Brandon Carlo is back on the ice, marking his return after a concussion he sustained on January 8, 2024. Notably, this isn’t Carlo’s first brush with such a critical health concern – an alarming factor that has necessitated a close examination of his condition and a cautious approach towards his return.\nBrandon Carlo’s Concussion History\nThe issue of concussions has been a recurrent one in Carlo’s career, with the player having faced it multiple times. Never one to downplay the seriousness of the matter, Carlo has always been forthright about his condition. He has underscored the importance of not rushing back to the game, instead focusing on ensuring that he is in the right state of health before making a comeback.\nAdapting to Reduce Risk\nAs a step towards safety, Carlo has adapted his playing style to limit high-impact hits. He remains conscious of the need to keep a check on any persisting symptoms, fully aware that his long-term brain health could be at stake. This is particularly relevant in light of the discussions around Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) – a degenerative brain disease found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma.\nBruins’ Lineup Boost\nIn addition to Carlo, the Bruins are seeing the return of Derek Forbort and Matt Poitras from their respective injuries. Additionally, goalie Linus Ullmark is back in action after a lower body injury that turned out to be less severe than initially believed. These returns mark a significant boost for the Bruins, strengthening their lineup and raising hopes for an improved performance.\nBruins Celebrate Centennial\nMeanwhile, the Bruins have been celebrating their Centennial, paying tribute to teams from the late 1980s and early ’90s. One of the highlights of the celebration has been the reminiscence of the end of a long playoff losing streak against the Montreal Canadiens in 1988. Former player Randy ‘Stump’ Burridge fondly recalled the era and the enduring rivalry with the Canadiens, adding a touch of nostalgia to the team’s centenary celebrations.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "text": "La Paz, 03 de octubre de 2024 (ABI). – Por mayoría absoluta, la Comisión de Planificación de la Cámara de Diputados aprobó este jueves el crédito del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) de $us 250 millones, para las tareas de sofocación de los incendios forestales que afectan al oriente de Bolivia. El presidente de la Comisión de Planificación, Omar Yujra, exhortó a sus colegas a ratificar la norma en la sesión plenaria de la próxima semana, y hacer a un lado “elementos de corte político y demagógicos”. Este crédito de $us 250 millones fue canalizado por el BID, para ayudar a la emergencia por desastres naturales y salud pública. El organismo internacional aprobó el crédito en mayo y el Ejecutivo lo remitió a la Asamblea Legislativa en septiembre. De acuerdo con el BID este préstamo contingente permitirá ayudar a Bolivia a “construir mayor resiliencia financiera frente a inundaciones, sequías, incendios forestales y posibles brotes epidémicos y pandémicos”. El crédito se suma a otro por $us 75 millones, facilitado por el Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina (CAF), para también sofocar los incendios. Este segundo crédito es debatido en el pleno de la Cámara de Diputados, en virtud de un acuerdo multipartidario concretado por la presidenta en ejercicio Verónica Challco y que fue avalado por la mayoría de los legisladores en una resolución.

    "text": "The domestic FMCG market had reported a 9% year-on-year jump in September 2023 quarter sales and an 8.6% rise in volumes for the period. (Image/Reuters)\nFast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are counting on multiple factors for growth in the coming year. This includes commodity inflation, which is projected to keep product prices in check, the prospect of a favourable monsoon to boost rural growth, and the long-term trend of premiumisation, which is expected to keep urban growth going.\nThe year 2023 was marked by lower-than-expected festive demand, rainfall shortfall that limited rural growth, unseasonal showers that hampered the sale of beverages and ice-creams throughout the summer months, and inflationary pressures that kept rural customers mainly out of the market.\nSaugata Gupta, MD & CEO, Marico, said: “We expect the demand situation to improve by the next couple of quarters. Large players have increased their pace of innovation and premiumisation in urban areas. At the same time, players have focused on expanding rural distribution. Companies have also taken pricing action which should aid in good volume growth in the quarters ahead.”\nAlso Read Import duty waiver for tur & urad extended till end of FY25\nThe domestic FMCG market had reported a 9% year-on-year jump in September 2023 quarter sales and an 8.6% rise in volumes for the period, market research agency NielsenIQ (NIQ) said in November, led by urban markets. Rural markets, despite showing indications of progress, still had a long way to go before fully recovering, according to the market research firm in its quarterly market analysis.\nThese signs of stress were apparent in kirana channel sales, which constitute 80% of an FMCG company’s business in India. Modern trade comprises 12-13% and e-commerce around 7-8% of sales for an FMCG company.\nThe festive season of October-November, an important period for consumer companies, was lack-lustre for kiranas as the offtake of products such as beauty, cosmetics, chocolate and confectionery was weak. This happened as consumers chose to cut back on expenditure in rural and semi-urban areas, officials at the All India Consumer Products Distributors’ Federation (AICPDF), an apex body of FMCG distributors, said.\nA recent study by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Boston Consulting Group said that while inflationary pressures and weather uncertainty had hurt rural consumption in 2023, an improvement in supply-side constraints and more people getting into the consumption basket could help reverse the trend in the future.\nAlso Read Year ahead: Oil markets may remain volatile in 2024 also\nCompanies have taken note of these changes saying that they are putting more feet on the ground to push their direct retail reach, especially in rural areas. At the same time, firms also saw the importance of revitalising general trade by pushing affordable packs, increasing innovation at the bottom-of-the-pyramid and reducing inventory pressure and clutter within stores.\n“Though green shoots of recovery are visible, rural demand is still behind urban markets. There have been liquidity pressures in rural areas, which are reflected in poor offtakes during the festive season. However, we are hopeful of rural markets posting a strong recovery in the quarters ahead,” Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer, Dabur India, said.\nPrabha Narasimhan, MD & CEO of Colgate Palmolive India, says that companies need to focus on both urban and rural consumers to drive growth in the future.\n“We have become good at price-point packs with business being generated from them as they address consumers who have limited money. The other end of the spectrum are consumers who have money; I would urge companies to address those consumers and see if we are providing an adequate range of products,” Narasimhan said.\nAsif Malbari, chief financial officer at Godrej Consumer Products, said he remained optimistic about growth in the coming year. “In 2024, we expect an improved economic environment and lower volatility in commodity prices. We remain optimistic that our focus on market development will enable us to deliver market-beating volume growth,” Malbari said.\nAlso Read Cotton output may decline 8 per cent to 294.10 lakh bales this year: CAI\nK Ramakrishnan, MD, South Asia, Kantar WorldPanel, said that growing categories had a strong rural and urban focus and that they were also active in terms of innovations at regular intervals.\n“Brands in the growing categories are great responders to macro occurrences. They tailor-make perceptions around these trends,” Ramakrishnan said, citing the growth in hygiene and healthcare products during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPost-Covid, the “hygiene-aware” and “snacking intense” consumer had pushed up category contribution of segments such as noodles, biscuits and insecticides in overall volume change, Ramakrishnan said.\nWhile packaged noodles had touched 78% in terms of contribution, biscuits and insecticides had touched 67% and 64% each in terms of contribution to volume change within FMCG, he said.",

El Compostela afrontó el partido con la intención de remontar su puntuación en la clasificación tras perder el último partido frente al Coruxo por un marcador de 2-0. Por su parte, el Deportivo Fabril ganó fuera de casa 0-1 su último encuentro en la competición ante el Guijuelo. Gracias a este resultado, el conjunto coruñés es quinto, mientras que el Compostela es decimoquinto al terminar el encuentro.\nEl encuentro comenzó de modo inmejorable para el conjunto coruñés, que dio el silbatazo de salida en el Estadio Municipal Vero Boquete de San Lázaro gracias a un tanto de Guerrero a los 32 minutos. Tras esto, una nueva ocasión permitió incrementar el marcador del Deportivo Fabril, que aumentó el marcador con un gol de Ferreiro poco antes del final, concretamente en el 46, concluyendo la primera parte con el resultado de 0-2.\nEn el segundo periodo la suerte llegó para la escuadra visitante, que aumentó su cuenta goleadora con respecto a su rival con un tanto de Garrido a los 82 minutos, finalizando el enfrentamiento con un marcador final de 0-3.\nAmbos entrenadores hicieron movimientos en los banquillos. El entrenador del Compostela dio entrada a Manu Barreiro, Rodríguez, Selasi, Gil y Scorza por Hugo Matos, Markitos, Fausto, Fer Cano y Álvaro Casas, mientras que el Deportivo Fabril dio entrada a Carreira y Darío Germil por Mane y Kevin Sánchez.\nEn el partido el árbitro amonestó con cuatro tarjetas amarillas solamente al equipo local. Concretamente, se mostró tarjeta amarilla a Fausto, Rivas, De Prado y Carlos Pérez.\nCon esta buena exhibición el Deportivo Fabril asciende hasta los 43 puntos en la Segunda Federación y se queda en el quinto puesto de la clasificación. Por su parte, el Compostela se mantiene con 28 puntos, en posición de descenso a Tercera División, con los que llegaba a la vigésima jornada.\nEn la próxima cita del calendario, ambos equipos jugarán en su feudo.

    "text": "We're officially in the New Year, but we have to admit that mentally we're not ready for the cozy holiday season to end. That magical, restful time between December 25 and January 1 passes too quickly. Luckily, HGTV star [Erin Napier](https://www.countryliving.com/life/a45576520/home-town-star-erin-napier-best-seller/) took a moment to chronicle some special moments from her family's holiday, so we can reflect back on that cozy time. It is undoubtedly a busy time for Erin and [Ben Napier](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a45735348/hgtv-ben-napier-home-town-season-8-new-character/), as their popular [Home Town show](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a46054695/ben-erin-napier-home-town-season-7-interview/) returns to HGTV for its [seventh season](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a45850766/ben-erin-napiers-home-town-hgtv-return/) on January 7. But, judging by the photos Erin [shared on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1abnIcpI0V), the parents of two young girls know how to embrace their downtime as a family. Erin's post included photos of her Christmas decorations, kids' toys on the kitchen counter, a handmade gingerbread house, and daughters Helen (who just turned 6!) and Mae (2) playing by the tree. Fans were quick to praise her for keeping it real on social media, as usual. They left comments like, \"I love to see a home that’s LIVED IN. ❤️ Thank you for sharing these shots,\" \"Absolutely my favorite time of the holidays!!! It’s peaceful and messy and perfect,\" and \"It’s all about the perfectly imperfect gingerbread house under the dome for me.❤️\" Of course, this is the spirit of Erin's best-selling book, [Heirloom Rooms](https://www.amazon.com/Heirloom-Rooms-Soulful-Stories-Home/dp/1982190434/ref=sr_1_1), which showcases the \"beautifully imperfect, lived-in spaces\" of Erin and her loved ones.

    "title": "Farmers sound the alarm as concerning conditions point to future crisis: 'Their math does not add up'",
    "text": "Extreme drought conditions in Argentina are affecting the harvest season and leading farmers to rethink what they can expect in the future.\nWhat's happening? Significantly dry weather in the country since the beginning of the year is producing smaller and fewer overall crops than usual, according to a report in Reuters .\nDario Sabini, a farmer from Argentina, said that even though official estimates have already lowered the harvest forecast in response to the drought, it will likely turn out to be even worse.\n\"Their math does not add up,\" he said.\n\"It has to rain. Hopefully it will rain soon and we can improve [yields],\" said Juan Gardey, a soybean farmer. \"It's very complicated.\"\nWhy is it important? Argentina produces and exports a huge amount of grains every year. With fewer viable crops, not only will the farmers directly lose income, but the economy of the country will suffer, and there will be less food to go around.\nWatch now: Giant snails invading New York City? It's estimated that every week without rain during this harvest season could result in a loss of 5 million tons of each crop. Soy and corn are likely to end up with about 40 million tons each, a steep drop from last year's output of about 50 million each.\nWith the changing climate causing extreme weather such as drought and floods, this could be an early glimpse at troubling future harvest seasons. Scientists have recently warned that prolonged \"megadroughts\" are increasing worldwide.\nWhat's being done about it?
