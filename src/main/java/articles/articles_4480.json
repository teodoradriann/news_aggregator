    "text": "Two national pharmacy retailers are closing stores across the country, how does this affect Santa Clarita locations? Walgreens and CVS are closing stores across the country. Walgreens announced in late June that it plans to close up to a quarter of its 8,000 stores nationwide by 2027. CVS is in the midst of a three-year plan to close 900 stores, aiming at approximately 300 store closures a year, according to the pharmacy chain. Instead of operating more locations, the brand would focus on converting smaller stores into “health hubs” offering diagnostic testing, mental health services and hearing services, according to [CVS](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/coronavirus/cvs-to-administer-covid-19-vaccines-at-100-california-locations-including-l-a-county-365265) officials. “The company has been evaluating changes in population, consumer buying patterns, and future health needs to ensure it has the [right kinds of stores](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/crime/santa-clarita-deputies-arrest-suspect-in-walgreens-robbery-90880) in the right locations for consumers and for the business,” CVS said in a 2021 statement. Meanwhile, Walgreens also aims to complete its three-year plan of shuttering 900 stores by the end of this year. The company has roughly 10,000 remaining retail locations. As of Thursday morning, no information is available as to the future of the five [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/storelocator/find.jsp) and seven [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/landing) locations in Santa Clarita.

    "text": "One of Long Island’s most unique businesses just celebrated its fifth anniversary.\nKathryn Gawrych opened the doors of the Freeport Ninja Academy nine weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on Tuesday, Jan. 21 by the Massapequa and Freeport Chambers of Commerce to celebrate the five-year anniversary of a company that has fought through adversity and given opportunity for people to find their sport. Gawyrch attended a franchise expo, which along with her love for the show “America Ninja Warrior,” helped spark the idea of opening the 9,850 square-foot academy. The early 2020 opening put her in a difficult position.\nGawrych said that the academy was closed for four months during the pandemic. She said she generated no income during this time and struggled to pay rent.\nOnce open, the Freeport Ninja Academy took off. The academy offers around 18 classes per week, with a large majority of their students being children. Gawrych said the gym’s schedule mainly runs around children’s schedules.\nThe academy provides 12-week semesters for people to train.\nGawrych said each semester can have up to 150 to 200 kids. Classes run in the fall, winter, and spring and cost $510 per semester. Students learn four new obstacles each week that present different challenges and require different skills.\nGawrych says that you don’t simply complete one semester and move on.\n“ Each obstacle can be changed to be like seven different things or even more,” she said. “Ninja is kind of infinite. There are so many different things that you can just simply change one thing and make it something completely different. Kids aren’t going to get all of the obstacles throughout the 12-week semesters.”\nGawrych also said the academy caters to the students, providing them with the help that they need in order to complete all of those challenges.\nDue to the success of the Freeport location, Gawrych opened another academy in Smithtown. One head coach at the Suffolk County location is a three-time participant on “America Ninja Warrior.”\nAce Pritchard, a coach at the Freeport Ninja Academy also just competed in his first season of “America Ninja Warrior.”\n“It’s gonna be really cool because we’ll have big watch parties at both of the facilities,” Gawrych said. “The kids and parents love to support their favorite coaches, and it’s just a really cool thing for the community.”\nGawrych and the Freeport Ninja Academy look to continue training people through their motto, “Together, we’ll overcome all obstacles.”",

    "text": "[90 Day Fiancé](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/90-day-fiance/) star [Loren Brovarnik](https://screenrant.com/tag/loren-brovarnik/) can’t stop putting her foot in her mouth – the new comments she’s made about [Michael Ilesanmi](https://screenrant.com/tag/michael-ilesanmi/) while showing her love for [Angela Deem](https://screenrant.com/tag/angela-deem/) are insensitive and how! Loren has been in the news for mostly the wrong reasons in the past few months. It started with [Loren trying to lose her baby weight](https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-loren-hottest-model-poses-weight-loss-mommy-makeover/) obsessively and then undergoing surgery while calling it “natural.” She was called out when she smiled while posing for photos at a memorial in Israel. I would have preferred that Loren calmed down once she became a fan-favorite again for standing her ground [when Thaís Ramone and Sophie Sierra](https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-real-reason-thais-ramone-upset-loren-brovarnik/) bullied her on the Tell All, but Loren did just the opposite. While fans thought the Loren they loved and respected was back, she went ahead and praised Angela to the point that I felt like Loren was justifying Angela’s on-screen behavior. [Loren is very pro-Angela](https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-all-times-bottom-feeder-loren-brovarnik-dissed-castmates-said-angela-deem-played/), and it’s not a good look for her. She’s actively defending Angela while also saying Michael is a scammer despite Angela’s own private investigator having proved the Nigerian man’s innocence. [Related ](/best-reality-tv-shows-right-now/) [ 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now ](/best-reality-tv-shows-right-now/) Reality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now. Is Loren Acting Like A \"Bottom Feeder\" Again? Loren Should Mind Her Own Business Loren has an opinion about every cast member, and she doesn’t hold back while expressing it. She was the one who said she loathed Big Ed Brown when asked to name the cast members she disliked on a podcast. Loren could have chosen to dismiss the question, but she chose to name Big Ed. I often feel that Loren tries hard to impress fans. She knows that Big Ed is a generally unpopular cast member, so naming him wasn’t going to get her in trouble. However, Loren also did not expect Big Ed to be asked about her in an interview. Big Ed expected Loren to have shown some sympathy towards him. That’s the least he can expect from a co-star when he has to hear negative comments about his appearance, etc. online. He was hurt and said that Loren was a “bottom feeder.” He meant that Loren was like a troll making a fake account just to bully a cast member in the comment section. Loren could have learned from her mistake and not called Michael a scammer because that seemed to be something he'd been accused of for years. Michael's A User, But Angela's Worse Michael Did Not Deserve To Be Treated Badly, Even If He Were A Scammer Loren tried to again mimic what anonymous people online had to say about Michael using Angela to come to America. However, I think it would have been a better idea for Loren to also admit that Angela was also never an angel in the relationship. She knew what Michael wanted and treated him like dirt. Loren said she loved Angela in an Instagram Live. She said Michael had played Angela. In a different Live video that I watched on her Instagram, [Loren](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_I-q5KO9XP/?hl=en) declared Michael scammed Angela and that it was the “biggest scam” in the show's history. Loren did address the abusive actions of Angela on the show. She revealed she has told Angela that she doesn’t “condone” the way she handles herself and she “sometimes” doesn’t condone the way Angela speaks. Loren should have chosen her words carefully. She ended up showing sympathy for the alleged abuser and also went on to accuse Michael of buying a Mercedes using his GoFundMe money when she had no proof he had done it. Loren Keeps Defending Angela, Who's Been Abusive Angela Is Calling Michael A Fraud To Justify Her Misbehavior Michael later confirmed that the Mercedes had belonged to a friend and that he had just posed in front of it. Loren never addressed her mistake. I believe that her false accusations may have caused Michael pain and the least she could have done was publicly apologize to him on Instagram. Loren’s words show that she’s tone-deaf. I recall her saying that she doesn’t watch the show, which could be why she’s not aware of Angela’s cruel treatment of Michael. As someone who’s been a part of the franchise for so long, Loren needs to be better informed. 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 7 premieres on Sunday, September 1 at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC and Max.
