    "text": "Off-road drivers were swept away by river, says man who tried to save them A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. We need your consent to load this Social Media content. We use a number of different Social Media outlets to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "text": "Royal Bank of Canada - RBC plans to reduce its own GHG emissions through the electrification of the branch network it controls in Canada .\nWhile you may not see it, your local RBC bank branch is working towards being powered differently in the coming years. A multi-million-dollar plan to retrofit RBC's Canadian 1,200 branch network aims to cut 10,000 tonnes of onsite carbon emissions from its operational footprint.\nInstallation of an energy efficient electric Heat Pump HVAC unit at RBC Morningside and Milner Scarborough\nbranch. ( July 2, 2024 ) ( CNW Group /RBC) The bank will embark on a major initiative that will accelerate the retrofit of its extensive branch network in Canada , investing $35 million over three years in the first phase through the installation of energy efficient, low-carbon heating and cooling systems such as heat pumps, which will replace aging heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. RBC will first begin to convert the 62 per cent of branches where it is responsible for HVAC, aiming to accelerate this work to be completed by 2035. The bank will continue to work on electrification with landlord partners in the remaining locations. The bulk of the retrofit program is planned to begin in Spring 2025.\nApproximately 40 per cent of the bank's operational carbon emissions stem from its retail locations across Canada . By updating this essential equipment, RBC estimates total branch emissions can be reduced by 70 per cent.1\nThis initiative will help accelerate the operational goals outlined in the bank's Climate Report 2023 by reducing RBC's own global GHG emissions and increase sourcing of electricity from renewable sources. In 2023, the bank's ongoing shift to renewable energy sources led to a 67 per cent reduction in its emissions for global operations since 2018, RBC's baseline year. Additionally, the bank now sources 100 per cent of its total global electricity consumption from renewable sources.2\n'Progress is needed to reduce emissions that come from the buildings we work in, which largely stem from their heating source,' says Jennifer Livingstone\n, vice president, Enterprise Climate Strategy at RBC. 'Which is why we have made this ambitious commitment to our clients, colleagues, and other stakeholders including our investors. It is one of our largest opportunities for emissions reduction within RBC's operations.' Buildings are Canada's third-largest source of greenhouse gases, contributing about 14 per cent of total emissions annually. If the country is to meet its net zero ambitions, RBC estimates 65 million tonnes of carbon emissions must be saved from this source by 2050. Emissions per square meter have fallen in recent years. However residential buildings have made more progress than commercial since 2000, at about 25 per cent compared with 7 per cent.3\n'Achieving Canada's climate targets requires the building sector to prioritize energy efficiency and eliminate its reliance on combustion for heating, cooling, and hot water service for all new and existing buildings,' said Thomas Mueller\n, president and CEO of Canada Green Building Council . 'Industry commitments, such as RBC's to accelerate the electrification of their properties, is a positive first step in achieving wider decarbonization across building portfolios. Verification of performance through trusted third-party certifications is also critical in measuring and reporting on progress.'\nSpace heating is estimated to generate 85 per cent of carbon emissions in commercial buildings, and existing technologies are available to make meaningful reductions.4 RBC owns or through lease agreements has the responsibility for controlling 62 per cent of the HVAC units across its retail branch. The remaining 38 per cent are fully controlled by its landlords.\nJon Douglas\n, Director of Global Sustainability at RBC, says the bank has embarked upon an outreach program to understand its landlords' climate targets and to 'look for ways where both parties can work together in achieving mutually desirable goals.' With 22 million square feet of real estate, most of it leased from 500 landlords, Mr. Douglas\nanticipates engagement will 'help drive more climate action in the real estate sector.' He went on to say the bank is already in collaboration with a landlord of a flagship property to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions at the office site by 2040.5 RBC is also a founding partner of the Climate Smart Buildings Alliance , which was established in 2023 to help reduce emissions in Canada's buildings sector. Key areas of focus for the Climate Smart Buildings Alliance include increasing the use of low and zero carbon building materials; reducing combustion in buildings and supporting a clean grid; and reducing emissions through retrofits and net-zero new builds.\n1 This figure is based on a model RBC developed based on industry standard practices for calculating estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from various potential HVAC equipment replacement measures. Both the model and the results were confirmed by an independent third-party consultant.\n2 RBC procures renewable electricity through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other sources of renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n3 The $2 Trillion Transition: Canada's road to Net Zero (rbc.com)\n4 The $2 Trillion Transition: Canada's road to Net Zero (rbc.com)\n5 In order to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions at the office site by 2040, various approaches will be required, including installing low-emissions technology and the use of renewable energy certificates.\nAbout RBC\nRoyal Bank of Canada is a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

Camacho-Quinn, bronce en París, ganó el jueves con tiempo de 12.36 segundos, tan solo un centésima más lenta que en la final olímpica. La boricua superó a la francesa Cyrena Samba-Mayela (12.40) y a la estadounidense Masai Russell (12.47), que subieron más alto que ella al podio de las Olimpiadas el mes pasado. La francesa ganó la de plata en París, y Russell es la vigente campeona olímpica con el oro. La boricua ahora enfila a la final de la Liga Diamante, que será el 14 de septiembre en Bruselas, Bélgica. Jasmine llegará en la primera posición de la clasificación en la temporada, con 32 puntos, pero tendrá que ganar también esa carrera para conquistar el trofeo del circuito. Tobi Amusan, quien ha conquistado los últimos tres títulos de la Liga Diamante en los 100 metros con vallas, está fuera de contienda por lo que habrá una nueva monarca este año.

Le siguen Russell, con 26 puntos, la jamaiquina Danielle Williams, con 24, y Samba-Mayela con 23. A la final adelantaron las mejores ocho por puntos en el standing. Junto con las cuatro mencionadas, también correrán la final de Bruselas, Ackera Nugent (Jamaica, 22 puntos); Grace Stark (Estados Unidos, 19); Nadine Visser (Países Bajos, 17); y Ditaji Kambundji (Suiza, 16). Camacho-Quinn no participó en las últimas dos carreras de la gira. El 25 de agosto en Polonia tuvo dolencias en una pantorilla y en un tendón de Aquiles que la hicieron retirarse el mismo día de la carrera. Desde entonces descartó la que competencia que se celebraría cinco días después en Roma, Italia. Antes de la prueba de este jueves, Jasmine ganó e igualó su mejor tiempo de 2024 en el evento Athletissima, el 22 de agosto en Suiza, donde volvió a cronometrar 12.35 segundos después de correr para ese mismo crono en la final de los 100 con vallas de los Juegos Olímpicos, para colgarse al cuello la presea de bronce. Jasmine se convirtió así en la primera atleta de una delegación puertorriqueña en conquistar medallas en dos Olimpiadas, indistintamente de su género. Ambas han sido consecutivas, y la atleta aspira a competir cuando menos en unos Juegos de Verano adicionales en Los Ángeles 2028. Además de su victoria de agosto en el Athletissima en Suiza, también ganó este año en dos paradas de la Liga Diamante en China, ambas en abril al principio de la campaña. Aparte de sus dos preseas olímpicas, Jasmine tiene una medalla de plata y una de bronce en Campeonatos Mundiales de Atletismo.

    "text": "Knives and lasers don't mix … until they do On Call By the end of the working week, many a tech support worker feels like bashing the hardware with which they work. Which is why The Register each Friday offers a less aggressive outlet for any workplace frustrations that have accumulated, in the form of a fresh instalment of On Call – the reader-contributed column in which you share tech support tales. This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Lionel\" who told us he once worked on the help desk for one of the world's largest retailers. \"We had just rolled out Laser Radio Terminals to several thousand stores,\" Lionel told On Call, before kindly describing the terminals as \"an early wireless handheld that looked like a laser gun with a screen.\" The devices included a laser barcode scanner that store employees would use to scan incoming stock so it could be registered in point-of-sale systems. The rollout did not go well. \"Despite lots of testing we kept getting calls about the LCD screen failing after as little as a week of use,\" Lionel told On Call. A new round of testing the devices in the mega-retailer's labs could not reproduce the problem, so Lionel was sent to a store to observe how the terminals were being used in the field. \"When I arrived, the store manager escorted me back to the receiving area, complaining the entire way about the 'garbage' we were making them use, and how the old paper-based system was so much better.\" Lionel endured that complaint and settled in to watch the staff wield the terminals. Tech support world record? 8.5 seconds from seeing to fixing Hide the keyboard – it's the only way to keep this software running Yes, your network is down – you annoyed us so much we crashed it Techie took five minutes to fix problem Adobe and Microsoft couldn't solve in two weeks The problem quickly became apparent. \"In those days, you had to open a case of items and scan each of the items inside, and the store staff did this with a box cutter.\" To speed that process, store staff had taped a box cutter to the reader device – so they could open and scan with one hand and one tool. \"This involved slamming the LRT with the attached box cutter into thousands of boxes a day, which inevitably damaged the LCD screens,\" Lionel discovered. He also discovered that 300 other stores in the mega-chain had independently devised the same \"solution.\" And those stores were all ones that had complained about the laser terminal's lousy reliability. Lionel wanted to tell store workers that knives and lasers don't mix. \"I'd like to say we just told everyone to stop taping knives to laser terminals and the problem went away, but that didn't work,\" he told On Call. \"We ended up actually redesigning the LRTs to handle this type of use.\" What's the weirdest hardware modification you've seen – or made to keep users happy?

    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "title": "December was warmest on record for Victoria, other Island communities",
    "text": "Yes, December in Victoria was as warm as it seemed, with the highest-ever temperature totals for the month measured at Gonzales weather station. Victoria’s mean temperature at Gonzales for December was 7.7 C, well above the normal mean temperature of 5.2 C. Temperature and precipitation have been recorded at Gonzales since 1874. Environment Canada meteorologist Lisa Erven called the “temperature anomaly” of 2.5 degrees fairly substantial, noting much of B.C. saw above-normal temperatures for the month. “Many locations were within their top five and some locations hit their warmest December on record.” Joining Victoria in that group were Comox, Campbell River, Vancouver and Abbotsford. Comox had a mean temperature of 6.5 C in December, up from the normal of 3.5 C, and Campbell River’s mean temperature was 5 C — above the typical 2.1 C. As for precipitation, Erven said there was “a bit of a split weather pattern” for the Island in December, with Victoria at Gonzales receiving 84 per cent of the normal total and Victoria International Airport receiving 87 per cent, while Comox had 138 per cent and Campbell River 120 per cent. Precipitation on the north Island was boosted by some heavy rainfall late in the month, Erven said. Part of the reason for December’s relative warmth is that many of the month’s weather systems approached from the southwest, she said. “When that happens, they typically bring up more mild air from southerly origins,” Erven said. “As our weather systems made their way through the province, they were bringing that mild air with them.” That meant precipitation largely fell as rain at low elevations, and even at middle and upper levels at times, she said. Erven said temperatures should begin to drop to more normal levels once the weekend arrives. “Basically we’re going to finish out this week in an active weather pattern, so that means periods of rain and mild temperatures,” she said. “But then as we get into the weekend, the cold front goes through and we will be looking at temperatures that are way more seasonal for this time in January.” The result for Victoria should be daytime highs in the low to middle single digits and overnight lows approaching zero, with any chance of snow at low elevations most likely to come toward the end of next week. Farther up the Island, there is a possibility of snow at higher elevations — perhaps including Mount Washington — at the beginning of next week, Erven said. She said that the Malahat doesn’t appear to be due for snow any time soon, but those travelling on Highway 4 between Port Alberni and Tofino and Ucluelet should be prepared for the potential for snow Sunday into Monday. jbell@timescolonist.com >>> To comment on this article, write a letter to the editor: letters@timescolonist.com",

    "title": "Paro en farmacias: presentan un amparo contra el DNU de Milei y cierran los negocios al mediodía",
    "text": "La Confederación Farmacéutica Argentina (Cofa) anticipó que este viernes presentará un recurso de amparo ante la justicia para frenar la implementación del Decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU) 70/2023 del gobierno de Javier Milei y realizará un cese de actividades entre las 12 y las 13. La medida es nacional y según confirmó a Rosario3 Fanny del Rosario Ronchi, presidenta del Círculo de Prestaciones Farmaceúticas, las oficinas de farmacia de la ciudad adhieren. La Cofa considera que los cambios por decreto que impuso Milei a la actividad, es decir sin debate ni consenso, “lleva a la destrucción a la profesión farmacéutica” y “pone en extrema vulnerabilidad la salud de los argentinos”. La presentación, según precisó el presidente de la entidad, Ricardo Pesenti, será acompañada por una concentración frente al Palacio de Tribunales, en el centro porteño, en tanto las farmacias cerrarán sus persianas durante una hora, a partir del mediodía. El Círculo de Farmacéuticos de Rosario expresó además que se suma a la \"defensa de la profesión farmacéutica y de los estudiantes de farmacia\". \"También defendemos el modelo de la Confederación Farmacéutica Argentina del cual somos parte, la importancia del farmacéutico en todos los ámbitos, como actor fundamental del sistema de salud\", añadió Ronchi. \"Y en el caso de las oficinas de farmacias defendemos el modelo europeo, dando atención farmacéutica en cada dispensa\", agregó la dirigente local y contó que una delegación del círculo viajará a Buenos Aires para acompañar el reclamo. Los motivos La Confederación Argentina aclaró que “esta no es una medida política; de hecho, muchos farmacéuticos votaron a este gobierno, sin embargo, creemos que hay desconocimiento de las consecuencias graves que trae este DNU”. “Con el argumento falso de bajar el precio de los medicamentos, el DNU lleva a la destrucción de la profesión farmacéutica, minando 20 artículos de la Ley 17.565 de ejercicio profesional”, sostuvo la Confederación Farmacéutica en un comunicado. El DNU 70/2023, mediante la modificación de la ley 17.565, elimina la exigencia de que \"los medicamentos denominados de venta libre y de especialidades farmacéuticas, cualquiera sea su condición de expendio, sólo podrán ser efectuadas en todo el territorio de la Nación, en farmacias habilitadas\". También deja afuera el texto que especificaba que \"los medicamentos denominados de venta libre deberán ser dispensados personalmente en mostrador por farmacéuticos o personas autorizadas para el expendio\", indicó la COFA. A su vez, la medida dictada por el Gobierno deja sin efecto lo que establecía la ley, que determinaba que \"la venta y despacho fuera de estos establecimientos se considera ejercicio ilegal de la farmacia y, sin perjuicio de las sanciones establecidas por la ley, los que la efectúen podrán ser denunciados por infracción al Código Penal\". “También lleva al fin de las farmacias que están en los barrios más alejados, en los pueblos, beneficiando a las cadenas que se concentran en los grandes centros urbanos”, detalló COFA. Además, advirtió que, con estas medidas, “los medicamentos no van a bajar de precio, porque el precio lo fijan los laboratorios, no las farmacias”, pero “lo que sí va a suceder es que se pone en extrema vulnerabilidad la salud de los argentinos quitando controles sanitarios sobre los medicamentos”. “Si hay desvíos en la calidad, problemas de fabricación, adulteración o falsificación, no va a haber forma de detectarlo oportunamente ni de retirar esos productos del mercado”, destacó. “Los farmacéuticos somos imprescindibles, sobre todo hoy, en un contexto de crisis del sistema sanitario, cada vez con mayor demanda de atención. Brindamos servicios fundamentales como el control de la presión, aplicación de vacunas, de inyectables, curaciones, manejo de la medicación”, concluyó Cofa.",

    "text": "Las dos militares hacen parte de la tripulación de un helicóptero de guerra Black Hawk. La cabo Karen Portilla, (con las balas en la mano), es la única mujer artillera y la teniente Andrea Torres, es la piloto más joven.\nCon el pulso firme, pero a la vez guardando los toques femeninos, así son la teniente Andrea Torres y la cabo Karen Portilla. Estas valientes mujeres forman parte de la tripulación de un helicóptero de guerra del Ejército; la teniente es la piloto y la cabo es la artillera, es decir, quien maneja la potente ametralladora que sirve para proteger la aeronave de cualquier ataque o para defender a las tropas.\nLas dos militares caminan con propiedad por la base de Tolemaida, donde se encuentra la mayor parte de la flota de helicópteros Black Hawk del Ejército. Ni los cerca de 30 grados de temperatura parecen incomodarlas.\nLuego de recibir las órdenes de sus superiores sobre la misión secreta que tienen que desarrollar, Torres y Portilla salen de la sala estratégica con rumbo al hangar donde se encuentra el Black Hawk que comandarán. Entre las dos, le quitan el ropaje que cubre la aeronave y que la protege de la ferocidad del clima cundinamarqués.\nLas dos mujeres saben que de esa aeronave no solamente depende la vida de ellas, sino de otros uniformados a quienes tienen que ir a apoyar. Ambas siguen los protocolos establecidos antes de cada vuelo. Torres inspecciona los controles de la cabina y Portilla la ametralladora que va empotrada en el helicóptero, las dos saben que no hay espacio para errores, porque el más mínimo descuido puede terminar en tragedia.\n“A quien primero me encomiendo es a Dios y luego a mi papá que está en el cielo y es por quien yo estoy en el Ejército. En un sueño él me dijo que me fuera para el Ejército y acá estoy”, dice la teniente Torres, mientras revisa la aeronave antes de encender motores.\nEsta mujer, oriunda de Barranquilla, aseguró que de los momentos más fuertes que le ha tocado vivir como piloto de combate son las misiones cuando tienen que ir a brindar apoyo para rescatar a las tropas donde hay uniformados heridos.\n“Tristemente, lo que lo marca a uno muchas veces, y no es de alegría, son esas misiones en las que tenemos que ir a hacer rescate de personal herido, personal que necesita reacción inmediata, apoyo de nosotros. Al sacarlos y extraerlos se les ve las caras de angustia, de dolor, de sufrimiento, esos son los momentos más duros”, relató.\nPero ahí no paran los momentos difíciles. También contó que cuando se accidentan helicópteros son momentos muy duros para ella, como ocurrió en un caso en que falleció una amiga cercana, que era la primera mujer piloto en volar un UH1N, quien se accidentó en Quibdó, Chocó, un siniestro registrado en varios videos aficionados que mostraron cómo el helicóptero perdió el control en el aire y comenzó a girar hasta chocar contra el piso.\n“Quiero hacerle un homenaje a mi teniente García, esa fue la primera vez que supe lo que se siente ver caer a un ser querido en una misión. La menciono a ella porque sé que desde el cielo nos ilumina y nos guía. Desde los inicios tuvimos buenos lazos y verla caer ese día fue muy duro, eso no se puede explicar, afectan mucho esos hechos”, manifestó la teniente.\nLa primera militar artillera Del otro lado del ala del helicóptero, se encuentra la cabo Karen Portilla revisando las municiones, la ametralladora, que dispara entre 650 y 950 proyectiles por minuto, y la estructura donde irá anclada la poderosa arma. Esta caleña, de 27 años de edad, dice sentirse muy orgullosa de ocupar una posición que antes solo desempeñaban militares hombres.\n“Es una experiencia muy gratificante para nosotras las mujeres porque es una oportunidad que se nos está dando para demostrar que las mujeres somos valientes, guerreras, aguerridas y demostrar que nada nos queda grande. En este caso, las armas son pesadas, pero como vamos en vuelo no es necesario llevarlas cargadas, van en un soporte y se facilita poderlas cargar y manipularlas, y en el campo de acción recibimos constantes entrenamientos”, explicó la cabo Portilla.\n“Cuando salimos a vuelo experimentamos un vacío, pero a la vez me siento una mujer poderosa, una mujer fuerte, una mujer que ha superado sus propios límites y a la vez muy orgullosa de estar realizando esta labor. Soy la primera mujer tripulante del equipo UH60 Black Hawk. Para mí es un orgullo estar representando a las mujeres en esta valerosa misión”, añadió.\nTorres y Portilla aseguraron que volar las dos juntas es un sueño hecho realidad y esperan que a futuro toda una tripulación sea compuesta por solo mujeres. “Se siente respaldo, que así como somos las únicas, que ella por la parte de ser piloto y yo por la parte de ser artillera nos estamos apoyando mutuamente en representación del papel de la mujer en esas máquinas tan importantes”, dijo la cabo Portilla.\n“Los hombres se asombran cuando se dan cuenta de que somos mujeres, se sienten extrañados, pero lo reciben muy bien y hasta nos preguntan cómo fue el proceso, y esperamos que llegue el momento donde toda la tripulación sea conformada por solo mujeres”, señaló a su turno la teniente Torres.\nEn la actualidad, el Ejército tiene 14 mujeres pilotos y solamente una mujer artillera.",
