    "title": "KC Chiefs Agree to Contract Extension with Tight End Noah Gray - Details",
    "text": "Chiefs Agree to Contract Extension with Tight End Noah Gray Hours before the official start of the 2024 NFL season, the Kansas City Chiefs have reportedly agreed to a contract extension with tight end Noah Gray. According to Adam Schefter , it's a three-year, $18 million extension with $10.1 million fully guaranteed. In three seasons with the Chiefs, Gray has appeared in 50 regular season games and recorded 63 career catches for 640 yards and four touchdowns. He has also played in all 10 of the Chiefs' postseason games over the past three years, adding 13 catches for 117 yards. While Gray's box score numbers haven't been eye-popping, his usage in Andy Reid's offense is noteworthy. Gray has played 52% of the Chiefs' offense snaps in each of the last two seasons, according to Pro Football Reference , in addition to more than 200 special teams snaps in each of his first three years in the league. Gray, a former fifth-round pick, becomes the second member of the Chiefs' 2021 draft class to receive a contract extension ahead of the final year of his rookie deal after second-round pick Creed Humphrey became the highest-paid center in football this preseason. Two of the Chiefs' other 2021 draft picks, second-round linebacker Nick Bolton and sixth-round guard Trey Smith, appear to be playing out the final year of their respective rookie deals before having a chance to hit free agency in 2025. Why did the Chiefs extend Noah Gray now? Frankly, I hadn't spent much time considering if the Chiefs would try to extend Gray this offseason. Humphrey was clearly KC's top extension priority, with Smith and Bolton both at least in consideration for new deals. (My assumption has long been that Smith would be best-served by a chance to test free agency next offseason and that the Chiefs would be best-off by not overpaying Bolton.) Gray has been a useful and reliable player during his time in Kansas City, but that hasn't historically been the type of deal that general manager Brett Veach has sought to sort out before the player's final season. For example, defensive end Mike Danna — a former fifth-round pick who evolved into a strong role player — hit free agency before returning to the Chiefs with a late free agency reunion in April . Danna became Veach's first draft pick to sign a multi-year deal in KC beyond the initial rookie contact. Humphrey was the first Veach draftee to sign an extension while under contract, and Gray becomes the second. Humphrey is clearly viewed as one of the league's best centers. Gray is KC's current No. 2 tight end behind Travis Kelce and, interestingly, ahead of rookie fourth-round pick Jared Wiley, who KC took at No. 131 overall in the 2024 draft. There's a chance that Gray's extension was always in the cards, with the Chiefs being willing to pay Gray something around $10 million total for 2025 and 2026, assuming that the $18 million deal includes a back-loaded non-guaranteed final year. If the Chiefs expect Gray to see a jump in usage this season while the team manages the health and workload of Travis Kelce, perhaps KC believes Gray would have seen his price spike on the open market next offseason. On the other hand, maybe the Chiefs didn't love what they saw from Wiley's first training camp and sought to extend his developmental timeline. Could Gray be a bit of insurance if Kelce retires after the 2024 season instead of playing out his recently signed two-year deal ? It's possible. Ultimately, the Chiefs are paying a sizable chunk of change to make sure Gray remains in Kansas City through at least 2026, locking down a consistent player for years to come.",

    "text": "Sonitpur (Assam), Jan 20: Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Saturday that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country will be cent per cent free of the problem of Naxalism in the next three years. “I believe that in the next three years under Prime Minister Naredra Modi’s leadership, the country will completely get rid of the problem of Naxalism,” Shah said while speaking at the 60th Raising Day of Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) in Assam’s Tezpur on Saturday. Lauding the bravery of the SSB in fighting against Naxalism, Amit Shah said that along with the CRPF and the BSF, the SSB has brought the Naxal movement to an edge. “Along with protecting the border of friendly countries of Nepal and Bhutan, the SSB has fought against Naxalites in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar. I have heard of your bravery whenever I have gone on review of Naxal operations in these areas,” Shah said. Speaking on the role of the SSB in eliminating terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Home Minister said, “In Jammu and Kashmir, the SSB has laid down their lives while fighting together with the CRPF, BSF, Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Indian Army against terrorists.” Amit Shah said that the government has released a postal stamp to mark the occasion of the 60th Raising Day of SSB. “Today on the occasion of the 60th Raising Day of Sashatra Seema Bal, the Government of India also released a postal stamp. It will keep the SSB’s devotion to duty alive in front of the people of the country forever.” Shah said that the central government has taken several steps for the welfare of all the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and other organizations. “In the last nine years, Prime Minister Modi has taken several steps for the welfare of all the CAPFs, be it CRPF or all the other organizations deployed on the border like the SSB,” Shah said. Speaking about the history of the SSB, Shah said, “The SSB has a rich history of being immersed in the service and protection of our country. After the India-China war, SSB was established in 1963 and after Atal ji (Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee) implemented the policy of ‘One Border One Force’, SSB has been dutifully protecting the India-Nepal border since 2001 and the India-Bhutan border since 2004.” The Union Home Minister attended the 60th Raising Day of Sashatra Seema Bal at SSB Complex in Tezpur along with Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.

    "text": "BOUNTIFUL, Utah — In the shadow of the growing backlash over national plans to create a registry to track those with autism, a Utah group is spreading awareness by delivering sensory bags to educate people in different fields.\n“We’re going corner to corner across the state, giving every department, every sheriff’s office and every hospital some bags to use,” said Michelle Hiles with the Autism Council of Utah. “Our goal is to have one in the back of every patrol car.”\nThe council believes the bags will provide a valuable tool in overwhelming situations.\n“This comes in handy because some of our individuals are non-verbal or they become non-verbal in crisis situations,” Hiles added. “They’ll recognize this from school or an app on their phone.”\nEach of the Bountiful Police Department's patrol cars is equipped with a kit.\nUtah advocates share worries over privacy connected to autism registry:\n“I would say these encounters are becoming a lot more common and we’re trying to evolve as a profession,\" explained Sgt. Sam Woodall with the department. \"We now have mandated autism training, and I just think we’re going to continue to build and have extra resources, and I think this is a great addition to what we’re already trying to do.\"\nAccording to Woodall, Bountiful officers deal with mental health crises or autism related situations on a daily basis, and just two days after receiving the new kits, officers put them to work.\n“We had [a person] here at the police department and we could definitely tell that they were getting a little bit antsy and uncomfortable, we were just given [kits] two days prior, so we took one in and provided it to that person, and they loved it and it calmed them right down,” Woodall explained.\nThe bags are filled with simple items, like a fidget spinner and headphones, and they work well for individuals with autism.\nHealth\nAutism rates in US rise again to 1 in 31 kids, CDC says\nHiles said some people with autism naturally do things that draw attention, like stemming or not following commands. She believes that providing education to law enforcement in the form of the kits can help in future situations.\n“It’s a stressful situation from both parties,” Hiles added. “So we are just so happy to be able to help and bring calm to any situation that is going on.”\nSgt. Woodall said just having more awareness is important.\n“Training and finding different resources that we can use that makes us more effective out in the field and dealing with people with autism.\"",

In Scozia, è appena trascorsa la seconda notte senza corrente per circa 1.500 utenze, mentre ieri un fulmine ha causato interruzioni nella fornitura in Galles . La compagnia elettrica Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks ha comunicato di aver ripristinato l’alimentazione per oltre 46mila residenze colpite dalla tempesta, con particolare gravità nelle aree del Nord/Est e nelle Shetland. La società prevede di riconnettere le restanti abitazioni nel corso della giornata odierna e ha organizzato furgoni di emergenza per fornire cibo caldo e bevande ai residenti interessati a partire dalle 9.\nAndy Smith, direttore delle operazioni, ha esposto la difficoltà delle comunità coinvolte in questi due giorni, esprimendo gratitudine per la loro pazienza e supporto mentre le squadre operano instancabilmente per ripristinare l’elettricità. Nel frattempo, la National Grid ha segnalato che nella contea di Ceredigion ben 36.000 case hanno subito interruzioni elettriche a seguito di un fulmine. Purtroppo, la tempesta ha causato la morte di 3 persone il cui veicolo è stato sommerso dal fiume Esk, vicino a Glaisdale, nel North Yorkshire.\nNella giornata precedente, un temporale ha attraversato il Nord/Ovest dell’Inghilterra, seguito da un tornado che ha danneggiato abitazioni a Manchester . Circa 100 edifici sono stati colpiti da quello che la polizia ha descritto come “un tornado localizzato” a Stalybridge, nel Tameside, e nel villaggio di Carrbrook.

    "text": "ALGECIRAS (CÁDIZ), 7 (EUROPA PRESS) La consejera de Empleo, Empresa y Trabajo Autónomo, Rocío Blanco, ha subrayado la importancia que tiene el nuevo convenio del metal de la provincia de Cádiz, firmado este jueves entre la patronal del sector --Femca-- y el sindicato FICA-UGT, que viene a dar \"tranquilidad\" a las empresas y a los trabajadores. Así, ha calificado este día de \"muy importante\" después de \"un arduo trabajo\" en el que \"se ha conseguido llegar a una postura conciliadora\".\nEn declaraciones a los medios antes de la firma del nuevo convenio, con vigencia hasta 2031, la consejera ha recordado que la industria auxiliar del metal abarca más de 31.000 trabajadores de forma directa y que este acuerdo generará \"un marco de confianza para que las empresas al final inviertan, porque sin confianza no hay inversión\".\nAdemás, ha agradecido a ambas partes \"la altura de miras\" y su \"voluntad conciliadora\" para alcanzar un acuerdo \"de futuro\" que se ha negociado durante una \"huelga activa\" y que ha definido como \"el mejor del sector en toda España\", mejorando así las condiciones laborales de más de 31.000 trabajadores.\nHa puesto en valor el papel mediador del Sistema Extrajudicial de Resolución de Conflictos Laborales de Andalucía, que a su juicio ha sido una vez más \"un instrumento fundamental\" en todo el proceso negociador al ejercer sus funciones desde la \"neutralidad, la imparcialidad y el respeto a la autonomía de las partes\".\nSobre el nuevo convenio, Blanco ha apuntado a que tiene \"muchísimas mejoras para los trabajadores\", algo que \"también recalarán en las empresas\", al incrementarse la aportación económica en un 2,8% en 2025, retrotraído hasta enero de este ejercicio, y que \"a partir del ejercicio que viene siempre se seguirá con el IPC para que los trabajadores no pierdan poder adquisitivo\".",
