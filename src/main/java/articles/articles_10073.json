    "text": "24 maggio 2024 Esplora: toino imam brahim baya Condividi: \"Oggi un questore ha vietato una preghiera e questo è scandaloso \", queste le parole dell'imam Brahim Baya , dopo la decisione della Questura del capoluogo piemontese di vietare la preghiera mussulmana in programma venerdì al Politecnico. \"Non esiste uno spazio in cui si possa pregare? Questo è il tema. Non vogliamo una moschea dentro il Politecnico, solo uno spazio riconosciuto in cui pregare\", ha spiegato Baya, che poi, a chi gli chiedeva se anche gli ebrei potessero pregare all'interno dell'ateneo, ha risposto: \"Certo, gli ebrei sono nostri fratelli. Non ho mai avuto nessun problema con loro, ma abbiamo tutti un problema con il massacro in corso e non vogliamo che il governo rimanga silente. Oggi non avrei parlato né di Palestina né di Israele\".\nL'Imam ha poi chiarito il motivo per cui non ha firmato la diffida del rettore: \"Non sono io l'organizzatore. Io sono stato chiamato a officiare un'orazione in qualità di ospite e, in quanto tale, non sono io il responsabile\".\n\"Il problema è l'islamofobia che abita in questo Paese, nel mio Paese, perché sono 30 anni che vivo qui e reputo l'Italia il mio Paese - ha aggiunto Baya - Laicità significa libertà religiosa per tutti , come dicono gli articoli 19 e 20 della Costituzione. Come musulmani siamo la seconda religione in Italia, con circa 3 milioni di fedeli, di cui la metà è cittadina italiana. Nonostante questo, non abbiamo ancora la dignità di essere riconosciuti come pieni cittadini dal punto di vista religioso\".",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Interim Phoenix Police Chief Michael Sullivan says DOJ findings a ‘gut punch’ for officers Jun 13, 2024, 12:22 PM | Updated: 2:01 pm PHOENIX — Interim Phoenix Police Chief Michael Sullivan said he knew the results from the U.S. Department of Justice’s investigation into his department would be difficult to swallow for his officers. Sullivan, in an interview with KTAR News 92.3 FM’s The Mike Broomhead Show shortly after it was announced [his department committed multiple civil rights violations](https://ktar.com/story/5576864/doj-investigation-of-phoenix-police-department-finds-civil-rights-violations-longstanding-dysfunction/), said conversations about the results of the investigation began as soon as he took his role in September 2022. “I have been talking to officers for a long time about this because I knew what this day would feel like to them,” Sullivan said. “[I knew] it would truly feel like a gut punch and, you know, I’m sure that’s what’s out there today.” What did DOJ investigation into Phoenix Police Department reveal? The DOJ found that the department regularly used excessive force, unlawfully detained people experiencing homelessness, targeted minorities, violated rights of protesters and discriminated against people with behavioral health disabilities, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke said during a livestreamed press conference. Conduct by the police department and city violated the Constitution’s first, fourth and 14th amendments, according to Clarke. It’s the first time the DOJ found a pattern of discrimination against people experiencing homelessness, Clarke said, and the second time where Native Americans were targeted. The [DOJ first announced](https://ktar.com/story/4610838/department-of-justice-opens-civil-rights-investigation-of-phoenix-police/) it would launch the investigation in August 2021. Sullivan, who said he hadn’t yet read [the report](https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1355866/dl?inline), defended his officers. “I’ve had three officers shot in line of duty this year,” Sullivan said. “I have an officer who was stabbed in the neck. They put themselves out there to protect the community and do the right thing and I’m confident that 99% of the time, that’s what we’re doing out there.” What’s next for the Phoenix Police Department? It’s not yet known what the consequences will be, but Clarke said the DOJ will negotiate with city officials to determine what actions will be taken. Clarke applauded the department’s ongoing reform efforts under Sullivan but said more needs to be done. [Sullivan was hired](https://ktar.com/story/5176931/phoenix-names-interim-police-chief-to-lead-department-through-doj-investigation/) to lead Phoenix Police through the DOJ investigation after previously leading police reform efforts for three years as deputy commissioner for the Baltimore Police Department. A consent decree is typically used in such cases to advance police reform. City officials have said they intend to fight against the oversight of a consent decree, arguing it would create restrictions that impede ongoing reform efforts. “These officers do incredibly dangerous, difficult work,” Sullivan said. “We need to love on them. We need to appreciate them.” We want to hear from you. Have a story idea or tip? Pass it along to the KTAR News team [here](mailto:stories@ktar.com).",

    "text": "Snowfall has ended across the area! Looking back on some very high totals. The snow has ended across southeastern Wisconsin. Other than some flurries tonight, we don't expect any more accumulation. Milwaukee picked up 8\" of snow! Look at how crazy this winter has been! Milwaukee tallied 3.9\" from the middle of January to almost the end of March. Today changed all of that. Temperatures are expected to fall into the 20s, so a refreeze is likely. Use caution on driveways and secondary roads. Another system will approach the area on Sunday; however, other than a mix, the majority of the snow should stay across the western part of the state. Updated: 1 p.m. March 22, 2024 Snow is still coming down heavily for some southern spots. Meanwhile, others are starting to dry out.Milwaukee took a direct hit from this system with a snow total of 8\" as of 1pm. This is more than double the snow we've had since mid January and about a third as much as we've had all season long! That said, as snow ends for some the National Weather Service has canceled the Advisory for a handful of counties. Check it out: Even as the edge of the snow lines pulls away from Milwaukee, I'm still seeing light snow falling downtown. The counties in the Advisory can still expect snow over the next couple hours, but it should become lighter and more scattered in nature. Snow continues for many, but wrapping up to the north.Along and south of 43 cutting back through our southwest locations snow is still coming down at a good clip. Expect snow showers to continue for Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Konosha counties through mid afternoon before becoming light and winding down for the evening commute. The steady, heavy snow has wrapped up for a majority of southeast Wisconsin. We still have a few hometowns dealing with snow in two distinct areas. The first is light along and north of I-94. The second is heavier near the IL border and impacting southern Walworth and Kenosha Counties. Check out a current radar image that will update with time below: Additional snowfall the rest of the day looks fairly light with 1-3\" south of I-94 depending on if some heavier snow bands in northern Illinois drift north. North of I-94 probably sees less than an inch the rest of the day with scattered snow showers. Snow totals have been rolling in Friday morning. Highest totals have been in the I-94 corridor of Milwaukee, Waukesha and Jefferson Counties where 4-8\" of snow has been reported. Areas south and north of there have seen less.

    "text": "© Reuters. Optimism Is Akin To A Race Car 'Revving At The Starting Line,' Bullish Analyst Says Benzinga - by Murtuza Merchant, Benzinga Staff Writer.\nA close observer of Optimism (CRYPTO: OP) expects that the digital asset is \"very likely going much higher.\"\nThis prediction follows OP's recent all-time high in otherwise volatile market conditions, which saw Bitcoin 's (CRYPTO: BTC) price dip to $41,800.\nIn a series of social media posts, the analyst — who goes by the handle The Flow Horse — likened Optimism's recent price action to a race car \"still revving at the start line.\"\nThe token enjoyed a successful retest and reclaim of its yearly high of $3.45, aligning with similar past performances across the market.\n\"Just look across the entire market and see what has followed with each pair that has done this,\" Flow Horse stated, urging investors to give Optimism \"room to breathe\" and anticipate further upward movement.\nHowever, The Flow Horse acknowledged the influence of Bitcoin's stability on overall market sentiment.\nHe also expressed optimism for Mina Protocol (CRYPTO: MINA), a privacy-focused blockchain aiming for a lightweight footprint, suggesting it could see significant growth \"if BTC stabilizes.\"\nAlso Read: PancakeSwap Slashes Supply By 300M, Will Token Prices Rise Like Hotcakes?\nMina's resilience, remaining in the green and hovering near record highs despite the market dip, further solidified his confidence.\nThe analyst was also tentatively optimistic about Bitcoin itself, but noted the recent increase in funding rates indicated a potential leverage-fueled price manipulation.\nPrior instances of altcoins rallying in response to Bitcoin's decline are \"not a good look,\" according to the analyst.\nOverall, The Flow Horse's analysis highlighted Optimism's potential for significant gains, while urging investors to remain mindful of Bitcoin's influence and potential market instability.\nHis focus on the Mina Protocol suggests an additional avenue for potential growth amidst the current market uncertainty.\nRead Next: Crypto Hedge Funds Rise From The Ashes: 3 Industry Leaders Touting Significant Gains\nImage: Pixabay\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

    "text": "In a shocking incident, Khalistani terrorists reportedly targeted Satish Kumar, the president of Lakshmi Narayan Temple in Surrey, Canada on December 27. The attackers shot at least 14 rounds of fire at the house of Kumar’s son.\nThe incident unfolded at around 8:03 a.m. on December 27 in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue, India Today\nreported. According to a Surrey Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) statement, the targeted residence belongs to the family of Satish Kumar, the president of the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey.\nThe president of a major Hindu temple, Satish Kumar of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey, Canada, was attacked by Khalistani supporters. His house was targeted with at least 14 rounds fired last night.— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow)\n[@RishabhMPratap]with the latest updates. [pic.twitter.com/jLZvvi58ld] [December 29, 2023]\nSatish Kumar told India Today that his son’s house was attacked and at least 14 shots were fired at it. No one was hurt in the shooting, but the house was damaged by bullet holes. “I can’t say whether (the attack) was by Khalistanis or some extortionist. Police are investigating the case,” said Kumar, adding that the temple was also targeted by alleged Khalistani activists in the past.\nPolice remained on the site for several hours, reviewing evidence, questioning witnesses, and combing the area for possible CCTV footage.\nThe Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has taken over the case, and police are probing the motive behind the attack. Reports\nsuggest that the attack was in retaliation for the temple’s stance against Khalistani Extremist fanatics. Last month, when Khalistani radicals assembled to attack the temple buildings, a counter-protest was held at this temple.\nAs reported earlier, the Khalistani elements\nharassed the Hindu devotees outside Laxmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey in Canada on November 27, 2023, prompting the Hindu community to respond with a peaceful counter-protest. Hindu protestors waved religious saffron flags with Om printed on them and chanted Vande Mataram while the patriotic song played in the background. They also raised anti-Khalistan slogans such as ‘Neem Ka Patta Kadwa Hai, Khalistani bha*wa hai’, ‘Khalistan is porkistan’ and others. This is the third time Khalistan supporters have attacked the Lakshmi Narayan temple or its members.",

Une journée de mobilisation des taxis est à prévoir.\nAu lendemain du grand rassemblement qui a eu lieu dans la Ville rose, Stéphane Abeilhou , porte-parole de l’Union Nationale des Taxis de Haute-Garonne (UNT 31) donne le ton ce jeudi 25 janvier : « nous avons gagné une bataille, mais pas la guerre ».\nÀ lire aussi\nToulouse. Les tarifs sont désormais fixes pour aller ou partir de l’aéroport en taxi 400 véhicules rassemblés mercredi Ce mercredi, 400 véhicules étaient rassemblés . Ces professionnels, conventionnés avec la Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM), sont chargés du transport de patients pour assurer leurs rendez-vous médicaux. Des patients qui, à titre d’exemple, peuvent être suivis pour des chimiothérapies ou qui sont sous dialyse, et qui requièrent un accompagnement particulier de la part des chauffeurs.\nRetour en images sur le déroulé de cette journée :\nUn report de signature obtenu Plusieurs revendications ont été portées, à commencer par le report de la date de signature de leur nouvelle convention . Cette dernière était fixée au 1ᵉʳ février. Mais la tarification n’a pas encore été détaillée. « C’est comme signer un contrat de travail sans savoir quel est le salaire », avaient résumé Malika et Cynthia , deux conductrices de taxi.\nMalika et Cynthia faisaient partie des conductrices mobilisées mercredi 24 janvier. (©Marie Lamarque / Actu Toulouse) À la suite de la rencontre organisée entre la directrice de la CPAM et les sept représentants des taxis mercredi midi, les chauffeurs ont pu obtenir gain de cause, avec un report de signature « pour le 29 février », détaille le porte-parole, contacté par Actu Toulouse .\nOpposés au covoiturage sanitaire obligatoire Les professionnels ont aussi fait entendre leur opposition quant au projet de covoiturage sanitaire obligatoire , qui prévoit de contraindre les chauffeurs à transporter plusieurs personnes en même temps. « On considère qu’humainement parlant, on ne peut pas mélanger tous les patients, un enfant autiste avec un monsieur qui est en fin de vie », prend en exemple Stéphane Abeilhou.\nS’il comprend la nécessité pour la Sécurité sociale de faire des économies, il ajoute : « nous y participons grâce au transport simultané avec des patients sous dialyse qui ont rendez-vous au même endroit, par exemple. Il y a des cas de figure où l’on peut regrouper les patients. Mais rendre cela obligatoire, techniquement et humainement, c’est impossible ».\nCliquez ici pour visualiser le contenu Nouvelle journée de grève lundi Les chauffeurs de taxi ont encore des combats à mener.
