    "text": "Young & Established crowdfunding campground to help at-risk youth experience the outdoors EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WFIE) - An Evansville nonprofit is looking to build a space where at-risk kids and teens can experience the great outdoors for free. Young and Established has plans to transform land on Evansville’s west side into a campground. All the land is already secured, and Indiana housing and community development authority has promised $50,000, but only if the community pitches in too. “I don’t want to say it’s a lost thing these days with the newer generation, but being outdoors is very important for mental health,” said executive director of Young and Established, Courtney Johnson. Johnson says many of their kids and teens aren’t getting these same experiences. “A lot of our students never had the opportunity to fish or to camp and to do those basic things that I got to do and I’m sure several others got to do growing up,” said Johnson. Johnson says they’re hoping to change that by building their very own campground in Evansville’s behind the westside Walmart. “There’s a chance for them to fish and be in a space that’s just calm and peaceful, those things we just sort of take for granted. But the clock on that dream is ticking. Young and Established only has until September 16 to raise 50,0000 to unlock a matching donation to fund the building of the new site. “I think this is going to be something very big for our community and our kids are already excited,” Johnson said. That’s because before being ready for bonfires and dips in the lake, the land Young and Established has purchased needs a lot of work. “It’s really an old cabin,” Johnson said. “I mean it’s been around for a very long time.” Years of cobwebs and overgrowth have taken over the space. “We need to fix the cabin up, we obviously need to fix the deck and make sure the lake is safe. There’s just a bunch of things that need a little bit of work out there,” Johnson explained. Even in its disheveled state, Johnson says the kids at Young and Established see nothing but potential. “We showed a few of our kids the property just to see their excitement, and they were like, this is ours,” said Johnson. “Yeah, this is something we’re going to be able to have forever,” Young and Establish has 60 days starting Thursday to raise $50,000 to unlock a matching donation to clean this place up.

    "text": "Preserving Palestinian identity: Empowering children through art amid conflict and cultural loss Muhammad Abu Lihya, a graduate of art education specialising in antiquities and ancient artefacts, has been displaced from his home in [Al Qarara](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1814845), north of [Khan Younis](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67116403). He has since relocated to the Al-Mawasi area on the outskirts of [Rafah City](https://www.britannica.com/place/Rafah). Like many other Palestinians, Muhammad has been suffering from [hunger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-68614782#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20UN%2C%20famine,according%20to%20the%20IPC%20classification.), thirst, and the relentless cycle of [displacement](https://www.nrc.no/news/2023/december/gaza-displacement/). \"The war has taken a great toll on the mental and physical well-being of human beings. We have lived through many wars, but none like this one. It is beyond anything we have experienced,\" Muhammad, also an art facilitator for children at the [Culture and Free Thought Association](https://web.cfta-ps.org/), tells The New Arab. \"I cannot imagine our history being erased and obliterated. I simply cannot imagine it\" Despite being displaced from his home, Muhammad remains committed to preserving history and identity though his passion for antiquities and old objects and continues to contribute personally to this cause despite the challenges he faces. \"I cannot imagine our history being erased and obliterated. I simply cannot imagine it,\" Muhammad adds. Part of Muhammad's professional journey has involved teaching art to children in tents, focusing on drawing archaeological and historical sites. He explains that this idea came after the Israeli army's deliberate [targeting of archaeological sites.](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/living-archaeology-in-gaza) \"The Israeli war isn't just about people; it targets trees, stones, and the essence of Palestinian history and identity. It's an existential battle that will endure,\" Muhammad says. Preserving history and memory In early March, Muhammad began hosting art and calligraphy workshops three times a week, each session lasting two hours. These workshops start with discussions on the stories behind various archaeological sites, their historical timelines, associated eras, and the activities they hosted. Notably, Muhammad and his artist wife highlight significant locations like the [1,400-year-old Al-Omari Mosque](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-great-omari-mosque-barakat-trust/QgVxfKzvTdN69g?hl=en), the historic [Pasha Palace from the Mamluk era](https://www.instagram.com/trtworld/p/CkLfUL0qzJT/?img_index=1), the [Church of Saint Porphyrius](https://www.friendsoftheholyland.org.uk/blog/st-porphyrius-parish-church-in-gaza), and several other noteworthy sites. \"It is important to educate children about their history,\" Muhammad says. \"It is crucial to instil this knowledge in children by engaging their senses, both through their hands and their minds, so that it remains in their memories for a long time,\" he adds. Muhammad believes that drawing offers [essential psychological relief](https://www.unicef.org/eca/stories/dark-light#:~:text=Art%20therapy%20is%20a%20powerful,but%20expressing%20and%20unlocking%20emotion.) for children exposed to harsh conditions like war, bombings, loss, and displacement. Amid such turmoil, art becomes a vital outlet for them to express their emotions, find solace, and regain a sense of control over their lives. “It becomes a therapeutic outlet that alleviates their distress and helps them process their experiences. Furthermore, through drawing archaeological buildings and sites, children's awareness of historical information is enhanced,” Muhammad stressed. “I want them to develop a deeper connection to their cultural heritage and gain a renewed appreciation for the significance of preserving history in the face of adversity.” Through conversations with the children, Muhammad noticed how deeply attached the children are to the sites they visited before the war. He also noted their memories of every corner and stone of those locations. Ghazal Abu Musa, a 14-year-old workshop participant displaced from Gaza City’s Old City, said, \"At school, we used to go on field trips to visit all the archaeological sites in Gaza. Now, when I draw, I imagine them and remember how they were when I visited.\" \"It becomes a therapeutic outlet that alleviates their distress and helps them process their experiences\" Destruction of Palestinian architectural heritage In 2016, prior to the war, Muhammad and his wife took the [initiative to establish the Al Qarara Cultural Museum](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2021/0914/In-Gaza-a-museum-filled-with-history-picked-up-along-the-way), aiming to showcase the rich archaeology and history of the area. They collected artefacts, as well as items from the community. \"Back then, we hoped to contribute to preserving the culture and identity of our community,\" Muhammad revealed. \"But now, it's all gone.\" The Qarara Cultural Museum was [destroyed](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/12/01/which-heritage-sites-have-been-damaged-or-destroyed-in-gaza) by Israeli forces in October 2023, adding to a series of similar incidents. [The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-military-campaign-in-gaza-is-among-the-most-destructive-in-history-experts-say) has destroyed numerous archaeological sites, each holding significant cultural and historical value spanning centuries. A [study](https://www.heritageforpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Report-of-the-effects-of-the-last-war-of-2023-on-the-cultural-heritage-in-Gaza-Strip-Palestine-english.pdf) conducted by the 'Heritage for Peace' group revealed that since October 7, Israel's war has led to the loss of over 100 archaeological and historical sites. Among the most prominent landmarks that suffered major damage were the afore-mentioned Great Omari Mosque, Church of Saint Porphyrius, a [2,000-year-old Roman cemetery in northern Gaza](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/11/28/bombing-of-gaza-has-damaged-or-destroyed-more-than-100-heritage-sites-ngo-report-reveals) recently excavated last year, and the [Rafah Museum in southern Gaza](https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2024/01/widescale-destruction-of-cultural-heritage-in-gaza/#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Al,early%20days%20of%20the%20war.), which was a popular place for students studying the region’s long history and heritage. Raising awareness and post-war initiatives To enhance people’s awareness of history, Muhammad mentioned that they started filling the tents with colours and papers, enabling them to draw inside, which he says led to increased productivity. “Many children started relaying the stories we share with them to their parents, prompting them to join in the activities we organise, be it storytelling or creating art inspired by archaeological monuments,” said Muhammad. After the war ends, Muhammad plans to gather a team of volunteers to collect and save whatever is left from the conflict in a safe place. The overall aim is to protect the Palestinian identity from extinction. “We should preserve history no matter what. We will continue to build history,” Muhammad stressed.

    "text": "“Solo parole, stipendi in ritardo, per 150 lavoratrici e lavoratori del call-center Mics che ha sede a Motta Sant’Anastasia e tra i suoi committenti ha Enel e Italia On Line. L’azienda non ha mantenuto gli impegni assunti con le organizzazioni sindacali. Oltre alle iniziative di protesta , abbiamo quindi deciso di scrivere a Ministero del Made in Italy- Mimit, Enel e Iol per denunciare la situazione”.\nI segretari generali di Slc Cgil e Uilcom Uil Catania , Gianluca Patanè e Gaetano Cristaldi, contestano “il comportamento senza precedenti tenuto dai nuovi vertici del call-center Mics, che ha pagato in ritardo i propri dipendenti a settembre e versato un acconto del 50 per cento su ottobre”. I due esponenti sindacali aggiungono: “Mics è una società leader nel settore e in passato, quando apparteneva al gruppo Abramo, aveva sempre garantito la regolare retribuzione al proprio personale nonostante le gravi difficoltà del comparto. Lavoratrici e lavoratori avevano risposto con sacrifici considerevoli dimostrando lo stesso senso di responsabilità che viene rivelato adesso, quando il servizio a favore delle committenti è puntualmente assicurato con la consueta passione e professionalità”.\nAperto lo stato di agitazione, assemblee e proteste “Il gruppo Abramo ha venduto il primo agosto il ramo aziendale Mics – aggiungono Patanè e Cristaldi – a una nuova proprietà, guidata da Federico Salmoiraghi . La cessione è avvenuta tramite procedura nazionale in sede ministeriale, con il Mimit come garante dell’operazione. Il management attuale si era presentato annunciando cambiamenti di prospettiva e la voglia di crescere nel territorio catanese, ma il ritardo nei pagamenti degli stipendi e l’assenza di coerenza rispetto alle promesse, persino quelle scritte, dimostra che alle parole non sono seguite azioni di pari effetto”. I segretari di Slc e Uilcom concludono: “Aperto lo stato di agitazione, sono già state indette due assemblee molto partecipate a cui hanno fatto\nseguito azioni di protesta, coordinate dalle nostre Segreterie territoriali e dalle Rappresentanze sindacali-Rsu. Malgrado ciò, è stato prestato un servizio come sempre impeccabile a Enel e Italia On Line. Siamo preoccupati e determinati, con tempestività e fermezza, a ogni iniziativa sindacale. Abbiamo già informato le nostre strutture nazionali e scriveremo immediatamente alle committenti di Mics e al Ministero garante perché siano a conoscenza di quanto sta accadendo in una provincia già segnata da una pesante crisi occupazionale e sociale. Chiediamo il saldo istantaneo delle spettanze dovute a lavoratrici e lavoratori ormai in seria difficoltà, nella speranza di un confronto con l’azienda finalmente serio e produttivo di effetti concreti”.",

    "title": "Nikola Jokić knocks down game-winner from near half-court as Denver Nuggets down Golden State Warriors",
    "text": "(CNN) — Superstar center\nNikola Jokić hit a spectacular game-winning shot against the Golden State Warriors on Thursday, banking in a three-pointer at the buzzer from the near the half-court line as the Denver Nuggets escaped California with a 130-127 win.\nWith 3.6 seconds left in the game and the game locked at 127, Nuggets forward Aaron Gordon inbounded the ball to Jokić well inside Denver’s half.\nThe match-up looked certain to head to overtime, but the two-time\nNBA MVP had other ideas. Jokić took three dribbles, made his way to the right sideline and heaved a deep, rainbow shot over Warriors center Kevon Looney.\nGolden State players and fans inside the Chase Center could only watch in dismay, as the shot rattled in off the glass as\ntime expired.\nWhen asked by\nCharles Barkley on the broadcast after the game if he “called glass” on his shot, the Serbian center responded in typical Jokić fashion.\n“My friend, it went in. I’m happy,”\nhe said.\nJokić’s stunning buzzer-beater was the exclamation point on the unlikeliest of wins for Denver. After a relatively tight game through the first half, the Warriors pulled away in the third quarter, outscoring the defending NBA champions 44-24.\nThings looked bleak for the Nuggets as they found themselves\ndown 18 with under seven minutes to go in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, powered by a near-triple double from Jokić, Denver stormed back and erased the deficit late in the quarter, with Jokić knocking down a\nshort jumper to tie the game at 127, before a costly Steph Curry turnover allowed the Nuggets to call time out to set up the game-winner.\nNuggets coach Mike Malone was pleased with his squad’s effort after the game.\n“When you get down to this team, it’s very easy to drop your head in this building with that crowd,” he said after the game. “That’s probably the thing I was most pleased with tonight is that everybody – coaches, players – we just stayed the course even after that third quarter.”\n‘The Joker’ posted 34 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists, while Gordon and Jamal Murray had 30 and 25 points respectively.\nThe ‘Splash Brothers’ pairing of Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 54 points to lead the way for Golden State, but it was not enough to get the Dubs over the line in what is proving to be a disappointing season. The Warriors are still awaiting the return of Draymond Green from\nsuspension and fall to 16-18 after the loss.\nMeanwhile, the Nuggets are 25-11 and occupy the third seed in the Western Conference.\nBucks edge past Spurs as Giannis battles Wemby\nTwo of the NBA’s biggest names faced off on Thursday as Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks took down birthday boy Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs.\nMuch of the attention pre-game was devoted to the duel between the two-time MVP and the 2023 No. 1 overall pick – and the matchup lived up to the hype.\nAntetokounmpo scored 44 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and dished out seven assists as the Bucks came away with the 125-121 victory. Damian Lillard also added 25 points and 10 assists.\nSpurs guard Devin Vassell led the way for San Antonio with 34 points, while ‘Wemby’ had 27 points and nine rebounds, producing an incredible\nhighlight reel on the night.\nA behind-the-back bucket, a self-alley-oop and a crunch time block – one of his five on the night – on Antetokounmpo were just some of the best moments for Wembanyama on his 20th birthday.\nHowever, the Frenchman’s rookie season is not going the way he would have hoped as the Spurs fall to a miserable 5-29 record, last in the Western Conference. Conversely, the Bucks are now 25-10, two games behind first in the East, as they seek their second NBA championship in four years.",

Confindustria, attraverso l'associazione Elettricità Futura, ha preso posizione a favore del governo, sollecitando la Commissione Europea ad aprire una procedura d'infrazione contro la Regione Sardegna. Al centro della controversia c'è la legge regionale che prevede una moratoria di 18 mesi per gli impianti di energia rinnovabile non ancora avviati, una decisione che il consiglio dei ministri ha deciso di impugnare. Il governo Meloni ha impugnato la legge regionale davanti alla Corte costituzionale, sostenendo che la moratoria non è applicabile. Il ministro Pichetto Fratin aveva già annunciato questa intenzione, sottolineando che la Regione non può decidere autonomamente di fermare l'installazione di pale eoliche e pannelli fotovoltaici. La legge regionale, secondo il governo, ostacola il progresso verso una transizione energetica sostenibile. La Regione Sardegna, dal canto suo, difende la moratoria come una misura necessaria per regolamentare l'installazione di nuovi impianti di produzione e accumulo di energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili. La proposta di legge \"Pratobello '24\", sostenuta da diverse iniziative popolari, mira a introdurre norme urbanistiche rigorose per garantire che i progetti di energia rinnovabile rispettino la tutela e la valorizzazione del territorio sardo. In vari comuni della Sardegna, tra cui San Gavino Monreale e Monserrato, sono in corso raccolte firme per sostenere la proposta di legge \"Pratobello '24\". Questa iniziativa popolare è vista come un passo fondamentale per garantire una transizione energetica che rispetti le bellezze naturali e le caratteristiche uniche dell'isola. La battaglia sull'energia eolica in Sardegna rappresenta un nodo cruciale nella più ampia questione della transizione ecologica in Italia. Mentre il governo e Confindustria spingono per un'accelerazione dei progetti di energia rinnovabile, la Regione Sardegna e i suoi cittadini chiedono che tali progetti siano realizzati nel rispetto del territorio e delle sue peculiarità.",
