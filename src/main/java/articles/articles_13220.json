    "text": "\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n See full bio \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Obaid Ur Rehman \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At Tech4Gamers, I mainly cover new gaming news, leaks, and rumours. Aside from that, I love to write features about my favourite games while inserting my opinion about their different aspects.\\xa0\n\\n \\n See full bio \\n Story Highlight \\n \\n Dragon Age: The Veilguard has received a lot of hate due to its \\u2018woke content\\u2019. \\n A major poll has now revealed that 94% aren\\u2019t happy with the game.\\xa0 \\n The majority of the players wanted the latest entry to be \\u2018a throwback to Dragon Age Origins with tactical combat and a darker tone.\\u2019 \\n \\n \\nDragon Age: The Veilguard was recently released to a positive reception from\\xa0critics. However, fans have massively criticised the game before and after its release, and some\\xa0 actions from BioWare have also caused concerns.\\xa0\n\\nDespite the controversy, the game has had a solid launch , but it seems to have not done so well sales-wise. That said, the franchise\\u2019s fans aren\\u2019t with the latest entry as a major poll has revealed 90% of players didn\\u2019t want the latest entry to be The Veilguard .\\xa0\n\\n Why it matters: The Dragon Age franchise is pretty well-known in the industry, so fans had high expectations from the recent entry.\\xa0\n\\n Only 6% of Players Are Satisfied With The Latest Entry In The Dragon Age Series \\nPirat_Nation on Twitter has highlighted that in a recent article, IGN conducted a poll asking fans \\u2018What did you want from Dragon Age 4?\\u201d Only 6% of the players voted for \\u201cExactly what The Veilguard is.\\u201d\n\\nOver 40% of the players voted for \\u201cAn Inquisition-style RPG that directly continued Solas\\u2019s story,\\u201d and nearly 48% voted for \\u201cA throwback to Dragon Age Origins with tactical combat and a darker tone.\\u201d\n\\nThis shows that 94% of the players aren\\u2019t happy with BioWare\\u2019s take on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The game was also review-bombed on Metacritic and many users have claimed that this isn\\u2019t the Dragon Age they were waiting for .\\xa0\n\\n \\nWhile innovation is always important, changing a franchise this much might not be the best move. The Veilguard\\u2019s launch also seems to have been pretty underwhelming compared to other hit RPGs, which explains why BioWare hasn\\u2019t given an update on the sales yet .\n\\n\\nReports have suggested that the game has had even lower sales than Star Wars Outlaws, which was a failure. Fans should also note that so far, no expansion for The Veilguard is planned, so this could be it for this game.\\xa0\n\\nWhat do you think of Dragon Age: The Veilguard? Do you think BioWare\\u2019s take on the game was the right approach? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below or join the discussion at the Tech4Gamers official forums .\\xa0\n\\n",

The Speaker of Britains House of Commons broke with convention this week to change the normal business of the house to, he claims, reduce the risk of its members and servants being murdered by terrorists. While an ostensibly laudable notion, the admission that the business of a Western democracy is being steered by the threats of radical extremists from without has triggered alarmed responses from several political figures, not least among them former Home Secretary (interior Minister) Suella Braverman, who has been one of the more forthright voices on migration and security in recent years before she was unceremoniously removed from post by her more progressively-minded master. Serving her take on the weeks events, in which the Speaker said he acted because he wanted to avoid another member of parliament being murdered by a terrorist, or another terror attack on the parliament itself, Braverman said the problem of antisemitism and Islamism in Britain had been ignored and allowed to fester, to disastrous effect. Now, she remarked those issues had grown sufficiently strong that: we see their influence in our judiciary, our legal profession and our universities The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now.

[11:15 AM · Feb 22, 2024](https://twitter.com/BreitbartLondon/status/1760699720345821260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1760699720345821260%7Ctwgr%5Ee7d5e8d18b29f99aab19452985674bc62a61a9c6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Feurope%2F2024%2F02%2F23%2Fthe-islamists-are-in-charge-in-britain-now-laments-braverman-in-wake-of-gaza-vote-shambles%2F) Politics, institutions, and the country itself is being bullied by Islamists, she said, and politicians remain too afraid of accusations of racism to do anything about it. In all, Britain is sleep-walking into: a ghettoised society where free expression and British values are diluted. Where sharia law, the Islamist mob and anti-Semites take over communities. We need to overcome the fear of being labelled Islamophobic and speak truthfully. Bravermans comments in an [opinion piece for th](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/22/islamists-are-bullying-britain-into-submission/)e Daily Telegraph come not only after the revelation that a Parliamentary vote was, in effect, spiked due to a combination of concerns about terror attacks on members of the house and party political considerations but as the counter-extremism system supposed to protect the UK comes under fresh criticism. Sir William Shawcross, a British government commissioner who conducted a review into the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy and found it wanting warned this week his recommendations for improvement hadnt been acted upon and the public remains at risk. Sir William said: The government has published a report saying that they have made some of those changes that I asked for, that I proposed but not enough and that some of his key findings had not been acted upon. He also pointed out the heightened terror threat to Britain in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel, and said the UKs counter-terror apparatus should pay much more attention to the Hamas support network There are unfortunately quite a lot of Hamas sympathisers and some operatives in this country, [reports the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68363058). Braverman also remarked on these failings, pointing out that again, accusations of racism had been used to destabilise the Prevent programme from protecting the British people. She said of the system, which is intended to identify potential future radicals and then deradicalise them, that: It has been labelled Islamophobic and racist because, in the main, it is set up to tackle the most dangerous terrorist ideology facing our country: Islamism We need to get over our cultural timidity to refer budding Islamists, where they are a threat, into the programme. The Conservative Party has, both in coalition and alone, now governed the United Kingdom for approaching 14 years. While many of the issues now being urgently discussed by right-wing politicians have their roots long before this long period in power, they have generally been neglected, if not outright promoted, by the Conservatives during the past decade, leaving criticism in many cases ringing hollow.

The Ghanaian government is currently undertaking an economic reform with a bailout package of 3 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund, hoping to rebound its economy.\nMENAFN28122023000153011029ID1107666108\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "¿Cataluña nos roba?",
    "text": "La propuesta de acordar -al menos con ERC- una propuesta de financiación singular para Cataluña, ha puesto en primer plano la necesaria revisión del sistema de financiación autonómica de la peor forma posible: el PP, como es habitual, ha recurrido a la demagogia y al anticatalanismo, anunciando todos los males posibles si el Gobierno “regala” a Cataluña parte del dinero que es de todos; también ha habido declaraciones desafortunadas desde la izquierda, con algún diputado -poco prudente o buscando unos minutos de gloria- dispuesto a “inmolarse” para evitar que nuestros vecinos sean “más” que nosotros. A estas alturas, no creo que nadie dude de que es imprescindible acordar un nuevo modelo de financiación. Esta es una de las cuestiones más complejas que tiene que resolver el Gobierno -de hecho, hace 10 años que se tenía que haber renovado- y, como todo lo complejo, para resolverlo hay que tener en cuenta las diferentes variables, analizar las distintas alternativas que se presenten, las experiencias de otros países, partir de que cada C.A. es una pieza a encajar en un rompecabezas complejo, procurar deshacernos de los prejuicios… No soy muy optimista en cuanto a la posibilidad de acordar un sistema de financiación razonable y adecuado a las necesidades de las personas que viven en cada Comunidad -en el debate político actual, prima más debilitar al adversario que buscar soluciones a los problemas de la gente- y en Aragón no hemos empezado bien. La comisión de Hacienda de las Cortes de Aragón ha aprobado una iniciativa del PP -con los votos de Vox, Teruel Existe y CHA- rechazando la condonación de 15.000 millones de deuda de Cataluña y que pueda tener un modelo de financiación singular. La reacción de la mayoría de las Cortes me recuerda a la de los sectores de la judicatura que, con el impulso del PP, se manifestaron en contra de la futura ley de amnistía sin conocerla. Claros ejemplos de prejuicios, de condenar antes de conocer. No es Cataluña la única Comunidad que tiene deuda- debido a una insuficiente financiación, algo reconocido por todos- y, lo lógico sería conocer las causas de dicha deuda antes de rechazar tajantemente su condonación. Es cierto que la propuesta de ERC hace hincapié en la negociación bilateral con el Gobierno, en ser diferentes -vaya trabajo que tienen con buscar hechos diferenciales, todos somos diferentes- pero no sabemos en qué consiste la singularidad que pretenden ni cómo va a afectar al resto de CC.AA. El Estatuto de Autonomía de Aragón, en su artículo 108, contempla el acuerdo bilateral, económico-financiero, con el Estado. ¿Por qué, algunos partidos critican la exigencia de bilateralidad por parte de ERC? ¿Somos mejor los aragoneses que los catalanes? ¿Cataluña nos quiere robar? La singularidad no tiene por qué implicar desigualdad, como tampoco el “café para todos” -tratar igual a quienes tienen distintas necesidades y parten de realidades muy diferentes- significa equidad. Todas las Comunidades Autónomas son singulares y todas reclaman que esa singularidad -población, territorio, dispersión de la población, envejecimiento de la misma…- se vea reflejada en el acuerdo de financiación. El reto está en, respetando las distintas singularidades, alcanzar un pacto ecuánime, que permita una redistribución equilibrada de la riqueza. Para el PP aragonés son más rechazables las demandas de los catalanes, algo sin concretar, que el dumping fiscal que practican sus correligionarios en Madrid, una realidad que repercute negativamente en las arcas del resto de CC.AA. y, ante la cual, no tenemos ninguna defensa: una competición para ver quién baja más los impuestos solo beneficiaría a las rentas altas, las que más beneficiadas fiscalmente se verían y las que no necesitan unos servicios públicos de calidad, ese 10% que acumula el 60% de la riqueza. Mejor harían algunos políticos aragoneses, los que responden a las iniciativas procedentes de Cataluña como el perro de Paulov ante los estímulos, en elaborar una propuesta de reforma del sistema de financiación autonómica que garantice la suficiencia financiera de las Comunidades Autónomas, la igualdad de los ciudadanos en el acceso a los servicios públicos y la solidaridad interterritorial.",
