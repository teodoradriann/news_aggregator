    "text": "Esporte Marchesín, goleiro do Grêmio, se revolta com decisões da arbitragem contra o Corinthians: \"Vergonha\" 25/07/2024 21h27 O argentino Marchesín, goleiro do Grêmio , disparou contra a arbitragem no intervalo do jogo contra o Corinthians , que acontece nesta quinta-feira, na Neo Química Arena, em São Paulo.\nMarchesín reclamou de um pisão de Yuri Alberto em cima dele, do pênalti marcado a favor do Corinthians após revisão no VAR e do gol do Grêmio anulado - também revisado pelo árbitro de vídeo. O argentino citou a tragédia no Rio Grande do Sul e classificou as decisões do árbitro Alex Stefano como vergonhosas.\n\"Isso é uma vergonha. O que está acontecendo hoje aqui é uma vergonha. Não importa se vou ser expulso ou castigado, mas vir jogar em um campo aqui (Neo Química Arena), com tudo que está acontecendo no Rio Grande do Sul, estamos sofrendo para c*, longe da família, vir aqui e ver o que está acontecendo. Cobrar um pênalti como cobraram. Isso é uma vergonha. Sinceramente, Grêmio é muito grande para estar sofrendo com isso. O Corinthians é uma equipe muito grande, e nós respeitamos eles. Pisaram em mim e não aconteceu nada. Um pênalti que pega na mão de um deles, está claro isso. Um gol impedido por pouca coisa. Quem inventou a regra? Quem traçou a a linha? Corinthians é muito grande para ter tanta ajuda. Uma vergonha\", disparou Marchesín.\nDemétrio Vecchioli\nBrasil descobre ter uma das melhores do mundo no gol\nCasagrande\nVencer a Nigéria deixa a seleção mais segura\nAndré Santana\nA dor das mães negras com filhos mortos pela polícia\nJamil Chade\nGuerras barram o sonho de despolitizar Olimpíadas\n???? #CORxGRE #Brasileirão2024 pic.twitter.com/NIEdCYvKZE\n? Grêmio FBPA (@Gremio) July 25, 2024\nO Grêmio abriu o placar da partida com pouco mais de um minuto. Aos 18 minutos, após revisão no VAR, o Alex Stefano viu um leve puxão de Kannemman na mão de Romero e assinalou pênalti a favor do Corinthians, que empatou com Yuri Alberto. Nos acréscimos do primeiro tempo, o Tricolor chegou ao segundo gol, com Cristaldo, mas o assistente viu impedimento na jogada e, depois de nova revisão, o lance foi anulado.\nAs equipes seguem se enfrentando em São Paulo, em duelo válido pela 19ª rodada do Campeonato Brasileiro.\nComunicar erro Veja também Deixe seu comentário Só para assinantes",

    "title": "Full list of police-recorded antisemitic and Islamophobic offences, by force | Norwich Evening News",
    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer. – Lancashire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic. – Leicestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6 – Merseyside Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10 The force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related. – Norfolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0 – North Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 – North Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2 The force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police. – Northamptonshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19 The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8 Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9 The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10 The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21 Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: No information held The force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22 Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25 The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53 Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49 The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list.

Details of alleged wrongdoing that led to Shah’s arrest were unclear.\nCalls and emails to Shah this afternoon for comment were not immediately returned. When reached by phone, Council President Felicia Ortiz said she had not been advised of the details of the situation.\nThe mayor of Prospect Park, Mohamed Khairullah, said in a statement that he had been made aware of Shah’s arrest.\n“While we do not yet know the full scope or outcome of the legal process ahead, I want to reaffirm that this administration holds all public officials to the highest standards of ethics and accountability. Our commitment to lawful and transparent governance remains firm,” said Khairullah. “This is undoubtedly a difficult time for Councilman Shah’s family and those close to him. I ask that we allow the legal process to proceed without speculation.”\nThe NJ Globe was the first to report news of Shah’s arrest.\nThe New Jersey State Attorney General and NJ State Police helped lead the months-long investigation, the sources said. No comment was available from either agency.\nA news conference is expected to take place Thursday afternoon in Trenton where officials will detail the charges.",

    "text": "C9 Entertainment is taking heat over its recent announcement for CIX .\nCIX | @CIX_Official/X Following Bae Jinyoung’s departure, fans of CIX have been waiting for new announcements about the group’s activities. On September 26, the group’s official account announced that C.I.X would perform their 3rd concert in Moscow, Russia, on October 26.\n| @CIX_Official/X In the past, due to the proximity, K-Pop groups would occasionally have stops in Russia. However, since Russia invaded Ukraine, this has not been the case.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia escalated the ongoing war by invading Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. The conflict is still ongoing, with more than 8 million Ukrainians fleeing the country in what has been the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.\nEmbed from Getty Images\nEmbed from Getty Images\nWith Russia having begun the invasion, many fans have expressed discomfort with the group going to perform in the country. Additionally, Moscow was recently targeted by a Ukrainian drone attack during which a woman was killed and three were injured, along with damage to dozens of homes.\nThe location where this drone strike occurred is just 64 km (around 39.75 miles) from the venue CIX are scheduled to perform at.\n| Maxim Shemetov/Reuters Moscow was previously insulated against attacks, but Ukraine has launched drone missions that venture deeper and deeper into the country.\nFans directed their criticism to the company, questioning their decision for the group. By sending the group to the country, some fear the company is showing implicit acceptance of what is happening and are not directing complaints at innocent civilians.\ni can't even begin to explain how many things are wrong w this like genuinely who the fuck came up w this idea and who the fuck approved it bc they need to be fired NOW https://t.co/pqNBHw2vIH\n— yy ☆ on break | CIX IS FIVE (@abcixer) September 26, 2024\nyou used the symbols of ukraine to announce a tour to the country of the aggressor that kills Ukrainians? what a crazy life. https://t.co/1NWFX4PwZr pic.twitter.com/dtKPR64AlK\n— skeityk✰︎ (@ONkoobi) September 26, 2024\nHow do you like blood money?

Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii. A video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance. Suddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves. Another angle captured by [Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him](https://www.facebook.com/1 103854833/videos/339998562146021/) down the street.

    "text": "- On December 20, Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops came out to clarify Pope Francis's remarks on the blessing of same-sex couples.\n- They said the Pope did not allow priests to liturgically bless same-sex couples and neither did he endorse the union.\nArchbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi Philip Anyolo has said any form of blessing of same-sex unions and activities would go against God's word and church teachings\nIn a statement, Anyolo said the declaration states and correctly affirms the traditional Catholic doctrine on marriage and family.\nHe said it also includes the disapproval of the Catholic Church of homosexual unions.\n“To make sure the fundamental doctrinal positions affirmed in the Declaration and the perennial teachings of the Church on marriage, is upheld, all Clergy residing and ministering in the Archdiocese of Nairobi are prohibited from blessing irregular relationships, unions, same sex couples,” he said.\nReverend Anyolo said the teaching of the Church on marriage is not only rooted in Scripture and Tradition.\n“This declaration confirms and reiterates the perennial teaching of the Church that marriage is to be affirmed as an exclusive, stable and indissoluble union of a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children and that the Church does not have the power to impart blessings on unions of persons of the same sex,” he said.\nHe said it is also rooted on natural law written into the hearts of every human being, Homosexual unions are against reason, against nature and against African cultural tradition.\n“The African cultural traditions equally detests it as it is clearly against transmission of life,” he said\n“The pastoral practices of the Church regarding marriage and family are always based on the Gospel of Christ which leads to eternal life and the enduring practices of the Church rooted in the Apostolic Tradition.”\nAnyolo further said it is for the reason that the Church excludes those living in irregular situations of marriage from full sacramental participation in the life of the church.\nThus, he said, the notion of blessing same-sex couples, or irregular unions, can be perceived as legalizing the relationships.\nOn December 20, Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops came out to clarify Pope Francis's remarks on the blessing of same-sex couples.\nThey said the Pope did not allow priests to liturgically bless same-sex couples and neither did he endorse the union.\nKCCB Chairman Martin Kivuva Musonde explained that the directive by the Pope was only to welcome those in same-sex unions to church in hopes that salvation will change.\n“This document seeks to awaken the invitation of all people to God's action and grace. The Church seeks to reach out to all individuals, to stir them to the path of conversion and salvation,\" he said.",

    "text": "President William Ruto's allies in the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party have intensified their efforts to push back against what they describe as tribal politics. In an apparent onslaught against Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua , the legislators claimed that they will not accept leaders harboring politics along tribal lines. Speaking in Nandi on Wednesday, the leaders echoed President Dr Ruto’s calls for legislators to traverse the country and perform their oversight and legislative roles effectively, a contradiction to DP Gachagua’s recent remarks that MPs should stick to their constituencies. National Assembly's leader of the majority Kimani Ichung'wah said representation of the electorate does not only begin at the constituency level and stop at parliament. \"MPs must traverse the country to understand issues and challenges citizens face. No one should limit the movement of leaders to their constituencies. They have the freedom to support the rest of Kenyans regardless of the community and political affiliations they belong to,\"Ichung'wa said. He regretted the tendencies of negative tribalism were creeping back after the 2022 elections. \"President Ruto was elected and this confirmed that Kenyans are beyond ethnicity and issue-based politics which now define a new political progress. The president has played an exemplary role in calling for unity and that is the course we support as elected leaders,\" the Kikuyu MP said. Ichung'wa accused the Gachagua-led wing for engaging in name-calling politics with a motive to scuttle careers of rising young leaders from the region. Following Gachagua’s calls for Mt Kenya unity , Ichung'wa said senior leaders should respect upcoming crop of leaders and offer them mentorship. Leaders including MPs John Paul (Igembe South ), Owen Bayo (Kilifi North), Faith Kitau (Women Rep Nyandarua), Cynthia Muge (Nandi women representative), Abraham Kirwa (Mosop), Julius Melly (Tinderet), Emulkheir Khassim (Mandera), Daniel Kiili (Igembe Central) and Emmanuel Wangwe of Navakholo constituency were in attendance in the thanks giving event. Also present were Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi and Nandi Governor Stephen Sang.",

    "text": "Is Dying Light: The Beast Crossplay?\nIs Dying Light: The Beast crossplay? Short answer: No, crossplay isn’t supported right now. Kind of disappointing, honestly—I was hoping this time, Techland would let PlayStation and Xbox fans finally jump rooftop-to-rooftop together.\nUser @Hazieon expressed disappointment that Dying Light: The Beast lacks crossplay, noting it would have been a welcome feature for the game.\nSo, if your best zombie-slaying buddy is on a different console, you’ll be waving at them from the other side of the apocalypse (or texting them to buy the same system). While Dying Light 2 had its share of multiplayer quirks, The Beast keeps multiplayer within the console or platform family—you’re either all in with PS5, or all in with the PC horde, but never at the same table.\nI get why game studios play it cautious; cross-platform features can sometimes feel like wrangling zombies in a windstorm. But in 2025, with half of Discord screaming “just give us crossplay,” you can’t help but feel Techland is missing an easy win.\nDying Light: The Beast Release Date\nRelease date? Dying Light: The Beast launches worldwide on September 19, 2025. That’s a Friday, which means you get a full weekend to ignore homework, cancel plans, and soak in those moody nighttime parkour chases.\nI still remember the original Dying Light drop—camped out on launch day, microwave pizza balancing in one hand, controller in the other, ready to panic every time the sun set in-game. There’s something delicious about that first day nervousness, especially when you know everyone else is right there with you, dying repeatedly and loving it.\nHow to Get Dying Light: The Beast Pre-Order?\nYou want to secure your copy? Dying Light: The Beast preorders are live now—and honestly, it’s pretty easy. Head to your favorite storefront (PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store) and you’ll see the Standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s Editions lined up like loot in an abandoned safe house.\nHere’s my informal guide:\n-\nDigital Preorder: Quickest way, gets you instant goodies. Usually includes bonus items, character skins, or XP boosters if you’re the “fashion over function” type.\n-\nPhysical Copy: If you’re old school (and want that big Collector’s box for your shelf), hit up retailers to snag bonuses like steelbooks or exclusive posters.\n-\nTiming matters: Sometimes, early birds nab limited skins or weapon blueprints, so don’t snooze if you want to flex in the first week.\nHonestly, there’s a bit of joy in logging in launch day, decked out in preorder gear, and getting at least 18 minutes of feeling invincible before a zombie throws you off a balcony.\nThe official @DyingLightGame account described Dying Light: The Beast as elevating primal brutality with intense combat and fierce finishers, promising an even more visceral gameplay experience.",
