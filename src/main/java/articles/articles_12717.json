    "title": "Country should be driven by a sound economic system - President Wickremesinghe - DailyNews",
    "text": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasised that the country’s progress would be undone without the implementation of a proper economic system. He stated that some individuals are spreading various statements aimed at undermining the economy and emphasised that falling prey to such false propaganda could lead to a permanent economic collapse. The President made these remarks while attending the opening of the main office of the Cinnamon Development Department in Karandeniya, Galle on Wednesday (10). A new department dedicated to the cultivation of cinnamon, called the Department of Cinnamon Development, was established and inaugurated following a proposal by President Wickremesinghe in the 2023 Budget. The President also launched the official website of the Cinnamon Development Department. He was presented with a ten-year road map for the promotion of the cinnamon industry and the “Cinnamon Handbook,” a technical publication on cinnamon cultivation, during the event. President Wickremesinghe also awarded GAP and GI certificates to selected cinnamon entrepreneurs. President Wickremesinghe also said: “After 200 years, we are re-establishing this department to revive the development of cinnamon cultivation in the country. The primary responsibility of this department is to enhance cinnamon production, starting with increasing output. Each acre of land should yield maximum productivity, and we should focus on cultivating high-quality cinnamon varieties instead of inferior ones. “The area under cinnamon cultivation needs to expand. The Government proposes providing new land and encouraging the cultivation of cinnamon alongside other crops. This initiative could potentially increase cinnamon production three to four times. “The sales must be boosted as increased production is futile without corresponding sales growth. To achieve this, we can seek both local and international expertise to enhance sales. If companies take on this responsibility, the Government is prepared to support them. “Therefore, we should move forward by seizing new market opportunities. We aim to establish this institute as a Cinnamon Development Centre in the Karandeniya area, operating not under the old system but using modern methods. “In this way, we are reaching into the past to secure our future. The main reason for our country’s bankruptcy was reliance on an import economy, taking on huge loans for imports. With the right economic policies, we have managed to free ourselves from bankruptcy. We have also reduced our debt by about US$ 8 billion and extended the repayment period until 2043. If we do not transition to an export economy, our country’s economy will collapse again in 15 years. Therefore, we must swiftly adopt a new economic system and earn foreign exchange through exports. “Historically, we supplied the world with cinnamon. Now, we must return to that legacy. In the past, cinnamon was cultivated from Puttalam to Hambantota. We need to restart these activities with a strategic plan. Additionally, we are working to attract new investments in various industries, including information technology. The situation that prevailed in the country two years ago should not be repeated. Some claimed that the country was beyond recovery and that my assumption of power was illegitimate. Yet, we have managed to steer the country towards recovery. However, if we fail to proceed in the right direction, this achievement could slip through our fingers. We have now set a course for advancing the nation. Amidst diverse opinions and promises, our focus should be on safeguarding our hard-won progress and advancing further. Therefore, by staying on this correct path for another decade, we can seize the opportunity for uninterrupted development.” The event was attended by State Ministers Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva, D. B. Herath, MPs Vajira Abeywardena, Sampath Athukorale along with other public representatives of the province, Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, Chairman of the Department of Cinnamon Development Janaka Lindara and various other dignitaries.",

    "text": "Rourkela: As bad weather continues to play spoilsport dashing the denizens’ hope of direct flight connectivity to Kolkata, Rourkela remains cut off by air. Sundargarh district has been experiencing extreme foggy weather conditions for the last several days.\nAccording to a source in Alliance Air, the visibility factor led to cancellation of flights from Rourkela Airport to Bhubaneswar and Kolkata. Rourkela Airport was supposed to start direct flights to Kolkata from December 26. However, bad weather has prevented the flight’s take off giving a harrowing time to those who had booked tickets.\nThe source informed that the visibility remained below 3,500 feet Thursday and it is dangerous for the plane to land in such weather conditions. Meanwhile, this was bad news for the 37 persons from Rourkela and 36 from Kolkata who had booked the tickets. Similarly, 57 persons had booked tickets to Rourkela and 54 to Bhubaneswar through the lone service provider Alliance Air.\nThe visual flight rules (VFR) is the answer to this problem. “With VFR trained staff the plane can land with the visibility of just 1,500 feet,” said Bimal Bisi, president of Sachetan Nagarika Mancha, who is waging almost a lone battle for the smoothening of the flight connectivity.\nInstrument landing system (ILS) remains a costly affair at this moment and there are other issues that are preventing the installation of the equipment here. Meanwhile, four staffers of Airport Authority of India (AAI) underwent one-day training for VFR recently. In all probability, they would be in a position to handle it from January 2.\nMeanwhile, Jual Oram, Sundargarh MP and Member of Parliamentary Standing Committee for Defence, has written to Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Minister for Civil Aviation, regarding issues faced by the Rourkela Airport.\nIn his letter, Oram has mentioned about the flight condition at the airport and sought actions in this regard. “The airport land belongs to the state government who has leased it to Rourkela Steel Plant. This is a major roadblock in the development of the aerodrome as the AAI is unable to undertake any developmental work here.” Oram has further requested that the land should be immediately transferred to AAI and some “RSP quarters be given to the agency for its staff.”\nBesides, he has also requested to start direct ATR flights to Delhi from this airport so that it would benefit the people and also the Smart City’s development. He has stressed that the airport should have a night landing system so that planes from other areas can fly in during night time, which will benefit the city immensely. The airport is in urgent need of the ILS, he said in his letter.\nWhile the MP is busy in pursuing the development of the airport, passengers continue to be tormented owing to the erratic flight connectivity. The Kolkata flight will be tri-weekly and will operate on alternate days of the week starting from Tuesday.\nBy Rajesh Mohanty, OP\n ",
