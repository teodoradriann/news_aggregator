    "text": "South Korea is turning trash into treasure. With an innovative method that could revolutionize how the global population deals with table scraps , the nation has figured out how to recycle 98% of its food waste — setting a trailblazing example for the rest of the world.\nEvery day, South Koreans transform over 15,000 tons of food scraps into compost , animal feed, and even the green energy source biogas , according to The Washington Post . This nationwide effort has been cooking for two decades, and the results are impressive.\nIt all started when the country banned food waste from landfills and made it mandatory for residents to separate their food scraps. There was some grumbling at first, but now it's just a part of daily life.\nSome apartment buildings even have high-tech bins that weigh your waste and charge you accordingly, detailed The Washington Post.\nThis waste-not approach is serving up serious benefits for both people and the planet. By keeping food out of landfills, we can help lower emissions of the harmful gas methane . Plus, all that old food is being put to good use, powering homes and nourishing crops.\nFood waste is \"one of the biggest — and dumbest — environmental problems we have today,\" Jonathan Foley, executive director of climate solutions think tank Project Drawdown, told The Washington Post.\nWatch now: Expert shares one belief that 'two thirds' of the US population across the political spectrum hold What works in South Korea could work elsewhere, too. Imagine if all nations took a page from their cookbook to slash carbon footprints, save space in landfills , and maybe even generate energy.\n\"I get a small sense of fulfillment knowing I'm contributing to lowering carbon emissions,\" said Lee Jaeyoung, one South Korean resident enthusiastic about the program, in The Washington Post . It's one sign that when eco-friendly choices become a normal part of life, everyone benefits.\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "title": "Papal Biographer: Pope Benedict Was ‘Bitterly Disappointed’ by Pope Francis",
    "text": "ROME — Peter Seewald, close friend and collaborator of Pope Benedict XVI, said Thursday that Benedict was “stabbed in the heart” by Pope Francis’ attacks on the traditional Latin Mass.\nSeewald, a German journalist who worked with Joseph Ratzinger — the future Benedict XVI — for over 25 years, said that Pope Francis has done his best to\neradicate the legacy of his immediate predecessor in every way possible.\nFrancis’ words at the requiem Mass for Benedict XVI “were as cold as the whole ceremony, which had to be brief so as not to honor his predecessor too much,” Seewald told La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana.\nPope Francis “seems to have an aversion to the westernized traditions of the Catholic Church,” said Seewald. “As a South American and a Jesuit, he has erased much of what was precious and dear to Ratzinger.”\n“Suffice it to recall the ban on the Tridentine Mass. Benedict had built a small bridge to a largely forgotten treasure island, which until then had only been accessible through difficult terrain,” Benedict’s biographer added.\n“It was a matter close to the German Pope’s heart and there was really no reason to tear down this bridge again. It was obviously a demonstration of the new power,” he said, regarding Francis’ harsh\nrestrictions on the celebration of the Latin Mass.\n“The subsequent purge of staff completed the picture. Many people who supported Ratzinger’s course and Catholic doctrine were guillotined,” he noted.\nSeewald stated that according to his sources, the pope’s claim that the majority of bishops had voted in favor of repealing Benedict’s Summorum Pontificum in a worldwide poll is simply “not true.”\n“What I find particularly shameful is that the Pope Emeritus was not even informed of this act but had to learn about it from the press. He was stabbed in the heart,” he said.\nIn his interview, Seewald also criticized Pope Francis’ severe treatment of close colleagues and supporters of Pope Benedict, such as Cardinal Gerhard Müller, Texas Bishop Joseph Strickland, Cardinal Raymond Burke, and Archbishop Georg Gänswein, Benedict’s loyal secretary.\n“It was an unprecedented event in the history of the Church that Archbishop Gänswein, the closest collaborator of a highly deserving Pope, the greatest theologian ever to sit on the See of Peter, was thrown out of the Vatican in disgrace,” Seewald said. “He was not even given a word of pro forma thanks for his work.”\n“Of course, the purge primarily concerned the man whose lineage Gänswein represents, Benedict XVI,” Seewald stated. “More recently, it was the American Bishop Strickland, Benedict’s friend and a critic of Bergoglio, who was removed from office on the pretext of financial misconduct, an obviously implausible reason.”\n“And when a Ratzinger supporter like 75-year-old Cardinal Burke is deprived overnight of his home and salary without any explanation, it is difficult to recognize the Christian fraternity in all this,” he added.\nAsked to comment on Francis’ appointment of his fellow Argentinian Víctor Manuel Fernández to head up the Vatican’s powerful doctrinal office, Seewald noted that Fernández’s incompetence was apparently less important than his fawning devotion to Francis.\nFernández, who was quickly given a cardinal’s hat, “is not qualified for this important task, except for one thing: he is the protégé of an Argentinian Pope,” Seewald said. “Until now ability was the main criterion for these appointments, but under Bergoglio it seems it is loyalty to the line that counts.”\nEven before taking office, Fernández had said he “wanted to change the catechism, relativize Bible statements and question celibacy,” Seewald said.\nFernández has used the ruse of “an expanded understanding of things” as “the door to be able to legitimize previously unknown interpretations of the Catholic faith,” he stated.\nIn his new role as prefect, Fernández has been exempted from having to deal with sexual abuse in the Church, Seewald observed, wryly adding that Fernández is no stranger to this topic since, as archbishop of La Plata, “he had covered up at least eleven cases of sexual abuse by priests.”",

    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Ore. – Multiple agencies are assisting with fire operations on the Upper Applegate fire burning in Jackson County. One of those agencies is the Jacksonville Fire Department. Jacksonville Fire was called for mutual aid Thursday night to help with structure protection. They helped residents close to the fire prepare their property as much as possible in case the fire moved close. This allowed more resources to be allocated to the fire. “It's a team effort,” said Jacksonville Fire captain Brian Barrett. “You can't just wall off one community and expect that the agencies within that (community) can handle a hundred percent of what goes on entirely.” Barrett said this also emphasized the role residents play in making sure resources aren’t tied up elsewhere. If residents practice safe habits, this allows fire resources to be available when they are needed most. “The crew that was on (the Upper Applegate Fire), they were kicking butt and it just hit them sideways,” Barrett said. “They couldn't anticipate that happening. It can happen to any crew, it can happen to any community.” NewsWatch 12 recently covered Jacksonville Fire’s student firefighter program. The link to that story is below. Fire stations throughout the Rogue Valley are filling holes in staffing with student firefighter programs, while teaching the students the skills they need to be active firefighters in the community. Students also helped out with the mutual aid response. Barrett said it was a great chance for the students to learn about situations where they’re called to help in other jurisdictions. “They have as much responsibility as a firefighter would once they're certified to that level,” Barrett said. “We expect them to be able to perform certain tasks and be ready, willing, and able to step in and (do) anything that we need them to do on an emergency.”",

The US military destroyed three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of Yemen’s rebel Ansar Allah (Houthi) movement, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) reported. \"In the past 24 hours, US Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed two Houthi unscrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) over the Red Sea and one UAV in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen,\" CENTCOM said on the X social network. Following the escalation of the conflict in the Gaza Strip, Ansar Allah warned that it would bombard Israeli territory and prevent associated ships from sailing through the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait as long as the operation in the Palestinian enclave continued. Since last November, the Houthis have been attacking civilian ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. On March 14 of this year, al-Houthi announced that his supporters intended to attack commercial ships that would be traveling through the Indian Ocean and around the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa. The Houthis later announced a \"fourth stage of escalation.\" They warned they would attack ships bound for Israeli ports throughout their reach, including the Mediterranean Sea.",

    "text": "TRIESTE - La Terra si prepara all'arrivo di una forte tempesta solare: i primi effetti dovrebbero manifestarsi già stasera, 10 maggio, mentre quelli più intensi sono previsti nella giornata di sabato 11 maggio. Il Centro di previsione meteorologica spaziale dell'agenzia statunitense Noaa ha aumentato il livello previsto per la tempesta a quello G4, il secondo più alto sulla scala, che prevede impatti sulla rete elettrica, sui sistemi di navigazione satellitare come il Gps e problemi a satelliti e veicoli spaziali, oltre alla maggiore probabilità di poter ammirare le aurore boreali anche a basse latitudini. «La tempesta potrà iniziare già oggi e proseguirà poi nella giornata di domani. Ma l'attività solare si manterrà intensa anche nel prossimo periodo, ci stiamo avvicinando al picco», dice Mauro Messerotti, docente di Meteorologia spaziale all'Università di Trieste. La tempesta è dovuta all'intensa attività di un gigantesco gruppo di macchie solari, chiamato AR3664, che si estende per circa 200.000 chilometri, dunque 16 volte circa le dimensioni della Terra. Si tratta di una delle regioni più grandi e attive osservate in questo ciclo solare, che è iniziato a dicembre 2019. La sua estensione lo mette in grado di rivaleggiare con un altro enorme gruppo di macchie solari, quello di Carington, che fece sentire i suoi effetti tra agosto e settembre 1859, provocando incendi negli uffici del telegrafo e innescando aurore vicino all'equatore. «La regione AR3664 è caratterizzata da una grande complessità, con campi magnetici molto intensi che causano una situazione particolarmente instabile - osserva Messerotti - ed è così grande che è visibile anche ad occhio nudo, ovviamente sempre con un'adeguata protezione».",

    "text": "Ex-CIA computer engineer gets 40 years in prison for giving spy agency hacking secrets to WikiLeaks [PTI](/pti-stories)| Newyork | Updated: 02-02-2024 06:15 IST | Created: 02-02-2024 06:15 IST A former CIA software engineer was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Thursday after his convictions for what the government described as the biggest theft of classified information in CIA history and for possession of child sexual abuse images and videos. The bulk of the sentence imposed on Joshua Schulte, 35, in Manhattan federal court came for an embarrassing public release of a trove of CIA secrets by WikiLeaks in 2017. He has been jailed since 2018. ''We will likely never know the full extent of the damage, but I have no doubt it was massive,'' Judge Jesse M. Furman said as he announced the sentence. The so-called Vault 7 leak revealed how the CIA hacked Apple and Android smartphones in overseas spying operations, and efforts to turn internet-connected televisions into listening devices. Prior to his arrest, Schulte had helped create the hacking tools as a coder at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. In requesting a life sentence, Assistant US Attorney David William Denton Jr. said Schulte was responsible for ''the most damaging disclosures of classified information in American history.'' Given a chance to speak, Schulte complained mostly about harsh conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, calling his cell, ''My torture cage.'' But he also claimed that prosecutors had once offered him a plea deal that would have called for a 10-year prison sentence and that it was unfair of them to now seek a life term. He said he objected to the deal because he would have been required to relinquish his right to appeal. ''This is not justice the government seeks, but vengeance,'' Schulte said. Immediately afterward, the judge criticized some of Schulte's half-hour of remarks, saying he was ''blown away'' by Schulte's ''complete lack or remorse and acceptance of responsibility.'' The judge said Schulte was ''not driven by any sense of altruism,'' but instead was ''motivated by anger, spite and perceived grievance'' against others at the agency who he believed had ignored his complaints about the work environment. Furman said Schulte continued his crimes from behind bars by trying to leak more classified materials and by creating a hidden file on his computer that contained 2,400 images of child sexual abuse that he continued to view from jail. During a two-hour proceeding, Furman noted a one-page letter the government had forwarded from CIA Deputy Director David S. Cohen, who described Schulte's crimes as causing ''exceptionally grave harm to US national security and the CIA.'' He added: ''His actions cost the Agency hundreds of millions of dollars; degraded its ability to collect foreign intelligence against America's adversaries; placed directly at risk CIA personnel, programs, and assets; and jeopardized US national security by degrading the CIA's ability to conduct its mission. In short, Mr. Schulte's actions inflicted heavy costs on the United States.'' A mistrial was declared at Schulte's original 2020 trial after jurors deadlocked on the most serious counts, including illegal gathering and transmission of national defense information. He was convicted at a July 2022 trial of charges in connection with the classified leak. Last fall, he was convicted in the case over the child sexual abuse images, which originated when a computer that Schulte possessed after he left the CIA and moved to New York from Virginia was found to contain the images and videos that he had downloaded from the internet from 2009 to March 2017. The judge described that trial as ''a bloodbath'' in which ''Mr. Schulte had no defence.'' Yet, Furman noted, Schulte was unable to express remorse for those crimes either. Of the 40 year sentence, Furman said the bulk of it was for the CIA theft while six years and eight months of it were for the convictions over the child sexual abuse materials. In a statement afterward, US Attorney Damian Williams said Schulte ''betrayed his country by committing some of the most brazen, heinous crimes of espionage in American history.'' ''When the FBI caught him,'' Williams continued,'' Schulte doubled down and tried to cause even more harm to this nation by waging what he describe as an 'information' war' of publishing top secret information from behind bars.''

    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on Thursday accused his main challenger for the top job, Jordan Bardella, of tolerating racist speech in the ranks of his far-right camp amid a heated last television debate before the start of parliamentary elections.\nThe debate between Attal, National Rally (RN) party chief Bardella and socialist leader Olivier Faure was the last direct confrontation of three radically opposed views on France's future before ballots open for the first voting round on Sunday.\n\"You can't build peace and unity when you present ... more than a hundred candidates who have been accused of making racist remarks\", Attal told Bardella, reading out press reports of the politicians using racial slurs.\n\"Each and every one of us must always be uncompromising with hate speech, because if we are not uncompromising, we end up legitimising it,\" he said.\nBardella, whose party is leading in opinion polls and could emerge the dominant political power in the country for the first time, rebuffed the accusations, shouting \"This is false!\" at his adversary.\n\"I don't like this way of associating a pseudo-climate of hatred with the National Rally electorate\", Bardella said later in the debate.\nReports of assaults motivated by race, homophobia and political allegiance in the run-up to the election has added to France's already tense social climate less then a month before Paris hosts the world for the Olympics.\nIn an unexpected move earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament and called the election after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections. The outcome will be known after a second round of voting on July 7.\nSeeking to present his leftwing alliance, the New Popular Front, as an alternative to those opposing Macron's pro-business agenda without shifting to the right, Faure called for a change of wealth distribution.\nCiting recent protest movements over cost-of-living issues like the \"yellow vests\" and farmers, as well as anger over a recent raise of the retirement age, Faure said:\n\"It is possible to reject the idea that there are people who through all the crises manage to get richer and richer, while others ... struggle to make ends meet.\"\n(Reporting by Tassilo Hummel, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",
