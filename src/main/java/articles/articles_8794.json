    "text": "Tattyana Heard Confident England Can Cope Without Jones in WXV Rugby Warm-Up By Priscilla Jepchumba Tatyana Heard is convinced England can compensate for Megan Jones's serious lack of a center partner as the team prepares for a WXV warm-up match against France at Kingsholm on Saturday. Heard and Jones provided a great combination in the Guinness Women’s Six Nations, where the English women’s Team emerged as the competition's winner and clinched another Grand Slam. However, Jones, who was expected to feature strongly in this month’s matches, will likely miss out through a significant ankle operation. Heard regards Jones’s absence as a “massive loss” for the team, but she sees it positively, as it opens the door for others to take up the position. \"It creates opportunities for other people,\" said Heard. \"It should be an interesting few weeks and an exciting time for whoever gets that opportunity.\" Speaking on Meg’s absence, Heard said, \"Meg is huge for us; her personality on and off the field is massive. \" She added, \"I think the biggest difference is the noise level; no one can be louder than Meg.” \"I think the biggest different is the noise level, no one can be louder than Meg.” “Noticing one person's voice to another, I think is something that goes unsaid, but it is a big thing. If I get used to hearing one person's voice I can tune into that very easily. Having to listen more to tune into a different tone, is a big difference for me,\" she added. Emily Scarratt, Helena Rowland, and Phoebe Murray are some players who could replace Jones on the team. However, she is happy to toil for the group and eagerly awaits the forthcoming match against France and New Zealand. “We always want to improve our previous performance, and our previous performance was France out in Bordeaux (a 42-21 win). And that, again, was a really, really tough game,” said Heard. “So, I think this weekend and next weekend are huge opportunities for us. When you come up against the top four teams in the world, you want to beat them,” she said.",

    "title": "‘How Did He End Up Here?’: Body of Black 12-Year-Old Boy Who Went Missing In 2020 Was the Fourth Discovered In House Known to Cops, Raising Community’s Suspicions",
    "text": "At least three other bodies were discovered in the upstate New York home, where the body of a 12-year-old who went missing nearly four years ago was found earlier this month, raising more questions about why it took years to find his body when, by many accounts, the house was a well-known trouble spot.\nOn April 12, Jaylen Griffin’s remains were found in a run-down house about five miles away from the Buffalo, New York, corner store near his home, where he was last seen in August 2020. He would have turned 16 years old last week.\nNow, his father, Brian Griffin, is trying to find answers to the lingering questions about what happened when he disappeared.\nThe dilapidated house where Jaylen was found was known to police, according to neighbors who spoke anonymously to\nNBC affiliate 2WGRZ.\nMore than 160 police complaints have been linked to the multi-home since 2007, according to 911 logs,\nobtained by WIVB.\nA body was found just two months before Jaylen went missing after a welfare check in June 2020. Another call in September 2022 points to the discovery of a body, while a third was discovered in August 2023, according to WIVB. One of the deaths was due to a drug overdose and the others died from natural causes, the local outlet reports.\nAfter a reported fire at the house several years ago, the residents have been “transitional” and included “recent parolees, sex offenders, and people with mental disabilities… who were entering and exiting at all hours,” according to neighbors who spoke off-camera to reporters. None of the neighbors, however, said they saw anyone matching Jaylen’s description.\n“How did he end up here? Was he moved? The questions are still remaining,” said Pastor Tim Newkirk of GYC Ministries, a community group that led searches in the South Buffalo neighborhood\n in an interview with NewsNation.\n“How long was he dead? How long was he deceased? Was he found in something that was locked and had to be opened? And did a certain aroma come out that would be a major complaint to this community? This looks like the type of community where if anything is taking place somebody will report it, or say something,” he noted.\nIn a\npress conference on April 15, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia indicated the body was severely decomposed, had been in the house for “a significant amount of time,” and had to be identified through dental records. It could be weeks or even months before a cause of death is determined.\nCommunity leaders who rallied around the family have pinpointed a fatal flaw in the investigation: police identified Jaylen as a runaway.\n“When Jaylen initially went missing, they publicized him as a runaway in which they (law enforcement) are only required to do the minimum or nothing at their discretion. By New York State law, they only have to use 40 percent or less of the resources on runaways,”\nexplained Kareema Morris, founder of Bury the Violence, on local news station 2-WGRZ. “We need to change that, there cannot be another opportunity for a child to end up missing for years, missing for weeks and deceased.”\nMorris is among a group of community leaders determined to change the law so that other missing children don’t fall through the cracks the way Jaylen did. She’s taking the issue to the New York Assembly — and beyond if she has to.\nNew York is one of ten states required to submit missing children to\nNaMus, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. But as Morris points out, the information is often out-of-date and inaccurate. “Runaways” should be categorized differently to draw more attention to cases like Jaylen’s when the first 48 hours are so crucial.\n“Law enforcement needs to list them as a vulnerable or endangered child. This is the most vulnerable population to become victims of violent crimes,” said Morris.\nJaylen’s case languished for years until a recent push by two detectives within the Buffalo Police SVU Unit began about six months ago. The renewed interest prompted\nCrime Stoppers WNY to offer a $7,500 cash reward in March to anyone with information on the missing boy. Shortly after, a maintenance man tipped police off to a body in the attic of the multi-unit house.\nJaylen’s family experienced several tragedies in the wake of his disappearance. Three months after he went missing, his older brother, Jawaan Griffin, was fatally shot across from his home when he was 18. Then, in the fall of 2023, Jaylen’s mother died.\n“I’m reminded by his mother Joann Ponzo, who on her dying bed said, don’t stop looking for my son,” Newkirk said.\n“Finding Jaylen’s remains gave his father, Brian, a small measure of peace. “But now, we have more questions. Who was so inhumanely disgusting to kill a baby?” Morris told News 4.\nGramaglia described an exhaustive search, that included cadaver dogs, numerous home searches, and coordinated grid searches within Buffalo and beyond the city limits.\n“We followed up on every tip that came in, including multiple psychics that called in tips… in an effort to leave no stone unturned,” he stated.\nBut still, that was not enough to save Jaylen.\n“We need to change the resources used, the time frame that’s used and we need to make them (runaways) a priority,” Morris told 2-WGRZ. “It’s sad enough that a missing child isn’t a priority, but to have stipulations to use less because of the word ‘runaway’ is disgusting.”\nBury the Violence has\nstarted a petition, #JaylensLaw, to strengthen New York State law for “runaway” children and funnel more resources into search efforts.",

    "text": "The year 2023 witnessed a historic meeting between Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi (left) and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh (Reuters) TEHRAN – As 2023 ends, Iran is bidding farewell to a challenging year in its relations with neighboring and eastern powers, but it has managed to neutralize several dangers that were looming over it. Although Iran and China signed a 2021-year trade and strategic cooperation agreement in March 25, Tehran began 2023 with a high reproach on Beijing following President Xi Jinping's visit to Saudi Arabia. Tehran summoned Ambassador Zhang Hua to express \"strong dissatisfaction\" with the Gulf-China summit statement, Beijing's acceptance of the inclusion of the three disputed islands with the UAE and the nuclear deal negotiations, and Tehran's call for \"non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\" Since the beginning of January, Tehran and Beijing have worked to overcome obstacles in their bilateral relations, and in mid-February 2023, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi paid an official visit to China, during which he met with his counterpart Xi Jinping and discussed with him the implementation of the strategic document signed between their countries. Observers in Tehran say their country has not reaped tangible economic benefits from its strategic partnership with China, but their shared economic interests have contributed to reducing Western pressure on the Islamic Republic. Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) in a previous meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi at the Moscow Kremlin (Sputnik) Iran and Russia In 2023, Tehran and Moscow worked to strengthen bilateral relations by finalizing their long-term strategic cooperation treaty, but the file of the three disputed islands between Tehran and the UAE has twice marred the Iranian-Russian partnership. Moscow's support for the Gulf position on the three islands infuriated Tehran during the sixth ministerial meeting of the strategic dialogue between Russia and the Gulf states hosted by Moscow last July, as well as the same position in the final statement of the sixth Arab-Russian forum held last week in Marrakech, Morocco. Last November, Tehran succeeded in completing arrangements for the purchase of Sukhoi-35 fighter jets and Russian-made helicopters, three months after receiving a group of advanced Russian Yak-3 combat training aircraft. The two countries also signed an agreement to finance and construct a 162-kilometer railway line between the cities of Rasht and Astara in northwestern Iran worth $1.6 billion, to be part of a transport corridor aimed at linking Russian and Iranian ports overlooking Gulf waters. Azerbaijan and the Karabakh War Iran's relations with Azerbaijan deteriorated in January following an attack on the Azerbaijani embassy in Tehran, which resulted in the death of a security guard and the injury of other employees, as Baku responded by closing the representative office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and expelling 4 Iranian diplomats and Tehran responded in kind. In addition to the arrest of dozens of people by the Azerbaijani authorities on charges of spying for Tehran and the latter's criticism of its northern neighbor for its rapprochement with Israel, the third Karabakh war, during which Baku regained sovereignty over the Nagorno-Karabakh region disputed with Armenia, last September, raised Iran's fear that Baku, with Ankara's help, would build the Zangezor corridor. Tehran considers that the project aims to create a \"Turkish world\" by establishing a corridor extending from Turkey to the Nakhchivan province through the Armenian province of Siunik adjacent to Iranian territory, to Turkmenistan and one of the Chinese provinces with a Uighur majority, which threatens to cut off the road between Iran and Eastern Europe through Armenia, which Tehran considered a \"red line,\" rejecting \"any geopolitical change in the region.\" Although Tehran's obsession with the corridor has cast a shadow over its relations with Baku and Ankara and strengthened its position in support of Yerevan, its agreement with Azerbaijan last November to establish a corridor linking Eastern Zangzor and Nakhchivan via Iran helped defuse tensions between them. Tehran previously targeted Iranian opposition bases in the village of Zarkiz outside the Iraqi city of Sulaymaniyah (French) Tehran and Baghdad In recent years, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has carried out missile strikes and drone strikes against Iranian Kurdish opposition headquarters inside the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. At the end of August, Baghdad and Tehran announced the signing of a security agreement to dismantle the opposition's gatherings, keep them away from the border with Iran, and hand them over those wanted. By September 19, the Iraqi side announced the implementation of the agreement. Economically, technical committees from Tehran and Baghdad reached, last July, an agreement to exchange Iraqi oil for Iranian gas, to ensure the operation of Iraqi power plants on the one hand and to confront the problem of US sanctions on Iran on the other. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, during his visit to the southwestern Iranian province of Khuzestan last September and Mohammad Mokhbar, Iran's First Vice President, laid the foundation stone for the railway link project between the Iranian region of Shalamjah and the Iraqi city of Basra. The Chinese-sponsored Iran-Saudi agreement in March and the resumption of diplomatic relations between them marked a turning point in Tehran's relations with Arab countries. Following the reopening of the embassies of the two countries and the exchange of visits by their foreign ministers, bilateral relations witnessed telephone talks between the presidents of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Following Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Raisi participated in the OIC Heads of State's meeting to discuss the war on the Gaza Strip and met with bin Salman in Riyadh, where he described the meeting in Tehran as historic. An Iranian parliamentary delegation visited the Bahraini capital Manama and held bilateral talks to restore relations between the two countries, stressing the desire of the two sides to open more prospects for cooperation. While Iranian circles have welcomed these efforts, they have not yet succeeded in melting the ice between the two countries. Qatari mediation succeeded in striking a historic agreement between Tehran and Washington to exchange prisoners (Reuters) Tehran and Doha On the other hand, Iranian-Qatari relations strengthened during 2023, and Doha's mediation between Tehran and Washington culminated in an agreement to exchange prisoners from both sides in exchange for the release of $ 6 billion of Iranian assets frozen in South Korea. Since the seventh of last October, Tehran and Doha have been leading intensive diplomatic efforts to stop the war on the Gaza Strip. Tehran's relations with Muscat witnessed a remarkable development, especially after the visit of the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq, to Iran in late May, and his meeting with Khamenei, where an understanding was announced between Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency on the controversial site of \"Abadeh\" in the case of detecting particles of uranium enriched by 83.7%. Iranian-Emirati relations have remained strong despite the two sides' disagreement over the three islands (Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb) in Gulf waters and Abu Dhabi's normalization of relations with Israel. After IRGC Navy Commander Alireza Tengsiri confirmed in April that his country intends to build housing on the three islands and create job opportunities there, Iranian Armed Forces spokesman Abolfazl Shakarchi said last summer that Tehran \"does not tolerate any party in the issue of the islands, stressing his country's sovereignty over them.\" The Durra (Arsh) natural gas field was also a controversial factor in relations between Iran and Kuwait, especially after the Kuwaiti-Saudi agreement - last summer - on joint production in it as their exclusive natural wealth, which Tehran rejected and affirmed its adherence to its rights to it. On the other hand, border tension between Iran and Afghanistan has intensified since the first months of 2023, leaving people dead and wounded in several exchanges of fire, but the water crisis in Iran's southeastern Sistan and Baluchestan province with the interruption of the Helmand River originating in Afghanistan have exacerbated their differences. Bilateral relations became more tense after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, on May 18, warned the Afghan authorities and set a one-month deadline to launch Kabul his country's share of the Helmand River water, to which the Taliban responded by issuing a statement criticizing Tehran's position and stressing that the water is not enough to flow into Iranian territory. The file is still open and Iranian circles are increasingly criticizing parliament for not holding the government accountable in this regard. Source : Al Jazeera",

    "text": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians Updated February 1, 2024 at 4:37 PM ET President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U.S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U.S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. \"This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, [according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-settler-indicted-for-throwing-stones-at-left-wing-activists/ 181-800a-da88-afef-d5cee72b0000) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, \"Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. \"The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel... prefers not to deal with this type of people,\" he told NPR. \"This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,\" he said, adding that all four had been \"involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians.\" Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, [said on X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/bezalelsm/status/1753093343507005858?s=46), that \"the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.

    "text": "Hyderabad: Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TGSRTC) is preparing to launch a large-scale recruitment drive, filling 3,038 posts across the organisation.\nManaging Director VC Sajjanar, in a post on X, said the appointments will be made purely on merit, with notifications to be issued soon by the Government Recruitment Board. The recruitment process, he assured, will be fully transparent, with no role for middlemen and no scope for irregularities.\nSajjanar cautioned unemployed youth against falling victim to fraudsters promising RTC jobs in exchange for money. “Those who attempt to secure jobs through backdoor methods will not be given employment. Anyone approached with such offers should report the matter to me directly or to the local police,” he urged.\nMoney, influence can’t secure position at TSRTC: Sajjanar\nHe emphasised that no amount of money or influence can secure a position in TGSRTC, and warned that fraudulent agents are actively deceiving job seekers.\nHighlighting TGSRTC’s turnaround since the formation of the Congress government in Telangana, Sajjanar said the once loss-making corporation is now profitable.\nThe free bus travel scheme for women has significantly boosted passenger numbers, and the corporation is also adding new buses to its fleet.",
