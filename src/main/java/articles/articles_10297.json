    "text": "EAST TAWAS, Mich. (WJRT) - A grand reopening ceremony for the Tawas Point Lighthouse in the [Tawas Point State Park](https://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=499&type=SPRK&utm_campaign=tawas+point+light+grand+reopening&utm_medium=pr&utm_source=govdelivery) will be held on May 2. The event will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., starting with an official reopening ceremony. Following the ceremony, visitors can check out vendor booths, including the Tawas Bay Art Gallery, Heritage Coast Sailing and Rowing, and Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, live music and lunch from food trucks, browse the gift shop and take a free tour of the lighthouse. The ceremony is free of charge, but a state park pass is required for vehicle entry. In Feb. 2023, the park received $455,500 in ARPA funds. The project was also outlined in Gov. Gretchen Whtmer's Building Michigan Together Plan. The primary focus was reversing the exterior deterioration of the lighthouse tower, the lantern room and the gallery. The lantern and gallery colors will look different to repeat visitors. The colors say the paint color will reflect what the lighthouse looked like in 1895. The DNR says that May 2 is a fitting date for the grand reopening ceremony because it marks the 147 anniversary when the lighthouse began to shine. The lighthouse will be open to the public on May 8 and be open for tour Wednesday through Monday from 12 - 5 p.m. until Oct. 20. Tours cost $5. Every Tuesday from June 4 through Aug. 27, the Friends of the Tawas Point Lighthouse and State Park will conduct tours by donation. For more information on the lighthouse, [click here](https://www.michigan.gov/mhc/museums/tawas?utm_campaign=tawas+point+light+grand+reopening&utm_medium=pr&utm_source=govdelivery).

    "text": "(WASHINGTON) -- U.S. military forces early Thursday morning conducted what Central Command called a “self-defense” strike against Houthi unmanned aerial vehicles and a ground control station.\nAccording to Centcom, the U.S. had identified a UAV ground control station and a number of UAVs in the Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The military “determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region.”\nAs a result, Centcom said, U.S. forces hit the UAV station, destroying it. Ten one-way UAVs were struck in self-defense, it said.\n“This action will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy vessels and merchant vessels,” Centcom said in announcing the news.\nAs part of efforts to stop Iran-backed Houthi militants from attacking vital Middle Eastern shipping lanes, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced earlier this month that the U.S. would once again classify the Yemeni rebel group as a terrorist organization. The State Department says the step will enable the U.S. to more effectively restrict the group's access to financial support.\nBlinken said that the restrictions and penalties linked to the designation would not take effect for 30 days and that the delay was designed to ensure the flow of aid and commercial goods to Yemeni civilians is minimally impacted.\nThere have been more than 150 rocket and drone attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since mid-October carried out by Iranian-backed militias claiming they are in support of Palestinians in the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza.",

En opinión del ministro, esto es lo que hace falta para que \"esta vez sea la última que vemos esta explosión de violencia\". Según Albares, \"los mapas están trazados, han sido acordados\" por las partes ya en el pasado pero \"falta la voluntad política, la valentía política\" para materializarlo.

    "title": "Homicides See Historic Decline In 2023 Despite Perceptions That Crime Is On The Rise",
    "text": "Topline After the pandemic brought historic spikes in murders, the U.S. is poised to finish the year with a historic drop in homicides and drops in other crime categories, a finding that conflicts with public perceptions that crime is on the rise, according to a recent analysis of criminal justice data.\nKey Facts Murders are down 12.8% over last year across more than 175 cities, according to criminal justice data analyzed by firm AH Analytics , with AH Analytics co-founder and data analyst Jeff Asher recently writing on Substack that the data suggests that U.S. murders are on pace to log “one of the fastest rates of decline ever recorded” this year.\nMajor cities, which some commentators have in recent years portrayed as overrun by crime, have seen significant declines in homicides, including double-digit declines in New York (11.42% as of Dec. 24), Los Angeles (15.45% as of Dec. 23) and Chicago (12.7% as of Dec. 27), per the AH Analytics murder dashboard, drawing from local law enforcement data across the country.\nRecently released preliminary third-quarter data from the FBI also shows that seven of eight categories of violent crimes and property crimes were down in cities of all sizes over the first three quarters of 2023—with the exception of car thefts.\nWhile it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes for crime trends, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told ABC News that she believed increased federal support to law enforcements targeting illegal guns has helped drive murders down, while other law enforcement officials across the country cited increased officer patrols.\nThe findings come as a recent Gallup poll shows that more than 77% of Americans believe that there is more crime than there was a year ago.\nKey Background Murder rates shot up in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising 30% between 2019 and 2020— one of the largest single-year increases on record, though still below historic peaks in the ’90s. Experts, politicians and pundits have hotly debated the causes of that rise, citing everything from the economic fallout of the pandemic, community-police relationships after the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests and criminal justice reform policies. Still, the precise factors are complicated and difficult to pinpoint, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nCrucial Quote “The quarterly data shows violent crime down in big cities, small cities, suburban counties, and rural counties, pretty much across the board,” Asher wrote on Substack, citing the FBI data. “The decline in crime shown in the quarterly data — if realized — would be historically large.”\nTangent While the murder rate is down, mass shootings are up, with 2023 the second-worst year for mass shootings on record, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\nContra Some cities have seen increases in murders, including Washington D.C., which has seen an increase of 36.18% as of Dec. 27 and Dallas, which is up 14.69% as of Dec. 27, per AH Analytics’ dashboard.\nFurther Reading\nJames Farrell",

    "text": "SEATTLE — People all over Washington state were treated to late-night views of the northern lights after a [powerful geomagnetic storm](/article/weather/weather-blog/northern-lights-forecast-washington-state/281-c8af2b7e-9fc8-43a4-8bc3-d8158a26ec5f) hit Earth's atmosphere on Thursday. KING 5 viewers sent photos in from Anacortes, Gold Bar, Sammamish, Carnation, Brief, Bellingham, Shelton, Wenatchee and many other places, showing the colorful aurora borealis which remained in the night sky for several hours. This was the biggest geomagnetic storm to hit since a powerful storm in May pushed the northern lights as far south as Oklahoma. The Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) which caused the aurora left the surface of the sun on Oct. 8 and made impact two days later. Northern lights over Washington state, Oct. 10, 2024 A CME is a type of solar storm that blasts solar material into space. When that material collides with the Earth's atmosphere, the particles glow different colors as they shed energy. Different types of solar storms, including CMEs, are blasting from the sun at all times – it's when the solar material is directed at the earth that we see an opportunity for aurora borealis viewing. The SWPC can predict these storms three to four days in advance due to satellites that can detect space weather events and measure solar wind. This is also vital to protect technology and services that people rely on that can be thrown into chaos when geomagnetic storms make impact. At the storm's peak, it registered as a G4 on a scale of 1-5, which is considered to be \"severe.\" May's storm registered as a G5, which is considered to be \"extreme.\" The G scale measures the forecasted impact to technology on Earth. Geomagnetic storms can change the structure of Earth's outer atmosphere, where signals pass back and forth between satellites and technology on the ground. They can also impact the power grid.",
