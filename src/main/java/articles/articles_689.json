    "title": "Famed Thailand holiday isles suffer water shortages after heatwave - The Hindu",
    "text": "The dazzling Thai holiday islands made famous by the Hollywood film \"The Beach\" are facing a severe water shortage following a blistering heatwave across Asia, a tourism official and locals said Thursday.\nThe Koh Phi Phi archipelago, off the west coast of southern Thailand, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to its pristine beaches and turquoise waters each year.\nBut a deadly heatwave that has sent temperature records tumbling across the region in recent weeks -- as well as a prolonged spell of low rainfall -- has seen reservoirs run low.\n\"The private company that provides water to the islands may have to stop the supply,\" Wichupan Phukaoluan Srisanya, president of the Krabi Hotel Association, which represents hotels in the area, told AFP .\nIsland authorities have discussed shipping in water from the mainland if the dry weather continues, she said but would hold off in the hope of the wet season arriving in May.\n\"But we want to assure tourists who are planning to visit the islands that we can manage this,\" Wichupan added.\nResidents who asked not to be named told AFP they had suffered fresh water shortages for months, and said some hotels had limited bookings as a result.\nAnd online posts by returning tourists warned travellers to \"check if their accommodation has fresh water\" ahead of their stay.\nOne wrote on review site TripAdvisor that \"tap water has stopped running\", as island water reservoirs had been dry since the end of April.\nScientists have long warned human-induced climate change will produce more frequent, longer and more intense heatwaves.\nWhile the El Nino phenomenon is helping drive this year's exceptionally warm weather, Asia is also warming faster than the global average, according to the UN's World Meteorological Organisation.\nLocal tourism operators have repeatedly called for long-term water supply investments for the Koh Phi Phi islands, which lack sufficient reservoirs and infrastructure.\nIn the Gulf of Thailand, Koh Samui -- another hugely popular tourist island -- has been experiencing similar dry, hot weather but the local tourism board said visitors had not been impacted.\n\"We have enough from a water truck, but it increases the cost of running hotels by three times more,\" the president of Koh Samui Tourism Association Ratchaparon Poolsawadee told AFP .\nThe extreme recent heat has blasted Asia, triggering heatstroke deaths, school closures and desperate prayers for cooling rain.\nFor around a week in April, Bangkok authorities gave daily extreme heat warnings as the heat index -- which takes into account other factors including humidity -- topped 52 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit).\nRead Comments Copy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "A Korean Air flight bound for Malpensa Airport (MXP) in Milan was delayed after a live bullet was found under one of the passenger seats right before takeoff.\nFlight KE 927 was being prepared for departure on March 24, 2024 and at around 11:20 local time, one of the aircraft cleaners found the bullet underneath a passenger seat.\nAccording to Incheon Airport Police Corps, the bullet found in the aircraft was a 9-millimeter and used in a hunting gun. The Boeing 787-9 had earlier arrived from Suvarnabhumi International Airport (BKK) in Bangkok, and police are conducting an investigation into how the bullet came to be lodged underneath the seat.\nAirport police conducted a thorough search inside the aircraft but did not find any other objects presenting potential danger and concluded that the bullet was not linked to a terrorism attempt.\nThe flight eventually departed Incheon Airport at 13:44, almost an hour and a half delayed from its original ETD.\nIn March 2023, a similar scenario occurred on another Korean Air flight bound for Manila International Airport (MNL). Two live bullets were found inside the aircraft prior to departure, and 230 passengers were evacuated. Security checks concluded that the bullets identified no immediate risk.",

    "title": "Letter: Thanks, Murkowski - Anchorage Daily News",
    "text": "Earlier this month, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has always led Congress on energy development and environmental stewardship, wrapped up a visit to the international climate conference in the Middle East with fellow Republicans, as well as Democratic colleagues, to stand up for a smart American position on energy issues and the climate challenge. I’m glad she stepped up again and was there. How she sees her — and by extension Alaska’s —presence there, where decisions are made and plans are cast, makes a lot of sense to me. In her own words, “We must be involved because we are impacted. We see it, we face it and so we must be involved in the solutions.” “(CO P28) is where we can put a spotlight on the problem with real assignments as to how we can move forward in a more coordinated manner.” Meetings like COP happen with or without Republicans’ or Alaskans’ participation. The senator’s representation ensures the climate challenge is taken seriously and avoids unrealistic and unwise restrictions on energy development. Murkowski deserves our praise for securing a seat at the table. Thank you on behalf of students across the state, senator. I hope you continue stepping up and supporting bold, commonsense action on this critical issue. — Zoe Fencil Anchorage Have something on your mind?

    "text": "PORTLAND, Maine — We want to warn you that content in this story contains video footage that you may find disturbing. The town of Canton, Ohio, is in the national spotlight after a 53-year-old man died in police custody there. Newly released bodycam video shows an officer kneeling on the man's upper back. Many people are comparing that tactic to [the case of George Floyd,](/article/news/nation-world/police-fatalities-less-than-fatal-force/507-a03a9755-ddeb-40c8-960d-bfe027500f36) who was killed when police in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for nearly 10 minutes. This case is different, and we don't know all the details yet. Sister station WKYC based out of Cleveland, Ohio, obtained the footage and made it available for other TEGNA stations to use at their discretion. Here's what we decided to share: Body cam video of the [incident in Ohio was just released Wednesday night,](/article/news/local/canton/bodycam-video-east-canton-man-tells-officers-i-cant-breathe-death-police-custody/95-ea2153fb-00e9-4634-a178-7f6d085cb9b7) but the case began on April 18, when police were called about a disturbance at an AMVETS Post in Canton Township. When officers arrived, they found 53-year-old Frank Tyson, who appeared agitated already. He was heard asking for the sheriff's department and was heard on the footage saying, \"You guys are gonna kill me. They're trying to kill me.\" Officers struggled with Tyson for about a minute, eventually forcing him to the ground and handcuffing him. About 10 seconds later, Tyson said he can't breathe while another officer knelt on his upper back for roughly 30 seconds. The officer gets up, and Tyson speaks: \"I can't breathe.\" Tyson lies there motionless for five minutes before officers checked for a pulse. \"Did he calm down?\" \"Yeah, he might be out.\" \"Is he breathing?\" An officer checked the pulse then walked away. It was another three minutes before officers rolled Tyson over and began trying to revive him. Body cam video showed them performing CPR for more than seven minutes. \"Where are the medics?\" That medical help eventually arrived, but not until 13 minutes after Tyson first went motionless. It was too late. The Canton Police Department has identified the officers involved as Beau Schoenegge and Camden Burch. Both were placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation, which is standard policy at that department. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is looking into the actions of those officers.
