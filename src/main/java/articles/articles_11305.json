    "text": "(CNN) — A series of powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean are [driving towering waves](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/weather/high-surf-ventura-san-diego/index.html) into the California coastline, triggering flooding and posing a significant risk to people and structures along the coast. Monstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets. A brief dip in wave heights may occur in some locations along the California coast during the daytime Friday as one storm pushes ashore, but the danger will quickly ramp back up later Friday and Saturday as another system develops behind it. “Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the weather service in Los Angeles warned. [Sea levels have risen](https://oehha.ca.gov/climate-change/epic-2022/impacts-physical-systems/sea-level-rise#:~:text=*%20Sea%20levels%20have%20increased%20over%20the,about%200.8%20mm%20or%200.03%E2%80%B3%20each%20year) along most of the California coastline over the past century, NOAA data shows, as global temperature climbs and melts glaciers and ice sheets. Higher sea levels are making [coastal flooding events worse](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/us/sea-level-rise-impact-california-climate/index.html) and will continue to do so in the future. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen- to 20-foot waves are expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening. The first round of dangerous waves hit alongside high tide Thursday morning. Several people were injured by a huge wave that slammed into Ventura Beach. The wave crashed over a barrier along the Southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous wave risk will lessen on Saturday for Northern California, but continue in southern Oregon and rival Thursday’s impact in Southern California. The Ventura County coast, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches face the most extreme surf and are at risk for significant coastal flooding. One of the storms helping to drive the waves will also bring rain and wind to California through Saturday. High wind alerts are in effect for California’s central coast and the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. These strong wind gusts will churn up waters even further. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard Thursday and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities Thursday and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about 7 feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/) an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.

    "title": "After Lewiston shootings, gun control is a serious campaign issue in Maine",
    "text": "In the wake of the Oct. 25 mass shooting in Lewiston, major political campaigns in Maine are likely to focus serious attention on gun issues for the first time in years.\nIn the U.S. Senate race and the U.S. House contest in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, what to do about the deadliest types of guns is already a hot topic.\nThe two incumbents in the races, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Lewiston have each shifted their position following the massacre of 18 people who went out for an evening of entertainment and instead met a hail of bullets from an AR-10 assault-style rifle.\nGolden, a combat veteran who fought with the U.S. Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan, opposed an assault weapons ban as recently as July.\nBut after the shootings in his hometown,\nGolden changed his mind and asked “for forgiveness and support” from constituents and survivors for his “false confidence that our community was above this, and that we could be in full control, among many other misjudgments.”\n“The time has now come for me to take responsibility for this failure, which is why I now call on the United States Congress to ban assault rifles like the one used by the sick perpetrator of this mass killing,” Golden said.\nBoth Republicans angling to unseat Golden, state Reps. Austin Theriault of Fort Kent and Mike Soboleski of Phillips,\noppose a ban.\nSoboleski said Golden was “using this tragedy to advance a liberal political agenda” and decried his decision to raise the issue when people need to “begin the difficult process of healing.”\nTheriault said it is “unfortunate and frustrating that, at this time of tragedy, Jared Golden and Joe Biden would try to score political points by attacking the 2nd Amendment. When I am in Congress I will defend every law-abiding citizen’s 2nd Amendment rights.”\nIn the Senate race, where there is no Republican challenger so far, King took a step toward restricting some guns in\na bill he introduced in November with U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico to regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic weapons.\nKing said the measure “addresses the lethal capacity weapons like the one used in Lewiston and most of the deadliest mass shootings across the country. Nothing can bring back the lives of our family and friends, but responsible actions moving forward can reduce the likelihood of such a nightmare happening again in Maine or anywhere else.”\nDemocrat David Costello, a Brunswick resident who is challenging King, said he has long backed “strengthening our nation’s gun safety laws and regulations.”\n“I was devastated by the recent horrific murder of 18 people in my former hometown of Lewiston,” he said. “Given the years and horror of escalating gun violence, it’s unconscionable that the U.S. House and Senate have done little over the last 30 years to truly address gun violence.”\n“Everything that can be done — from expanded mental health services, stricter gun crime sentencing, and increased community policing to waiting periods, universal background checks, red flag laws, assault weapons and high-capacity magazine bans, and ending immunity from liability for gun manufacturers — should be done to reduce gun-related deaths, and injuries in the United States,” Costello said.\nCostello said King’s bill “is a step in the right direction and is worth pursuing,” but “it doesn’t obviate the need for, nor equal the superior usefulness of an outright ban on the sale of such weapons.”\nParty primaries will be held in June.

    "title": "STALKER 2: Out of Video Memory Error Solution",
    "text": "Skip To...\nThe development of [STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/stalker-2/) wasn’t smooth at all. That’s why the game was released with various [bugs and issues](https://thenerdstash.com/stalker-2-developer-admits-technical-issues-reveals-plans-to-smooth-out-the-games-rough-edges/). While die-hard fans don’t mind about these problems, it doesn’t change the fact that there are those who can’t even play the game. One of the STALKER 2 errors you may encounter is the out-of-video memory problem. This error basically prevents you from launching the game due to your PC, but luckily, there are some solutions that you can try.\nHow To Fix Out of Video Memory Error in STALKER 2\nAlthough the Day 0 patches that the developer has shared have fixed some of the big issues that plague STALKER 2, the out-of-video memory error may still strike some poor fans. This bug will prevent you from playing by crashing the game and then giving you this terrible notification. Although it says that your video card causes this error, it is actually connected to your CPU.\nChange Performance Core Ratio\nThe first method that you can try is changing your performance core ratio. It seems the out-of-video memory error will mainly strike Intel users, specifically those who have 13th/14th generation CPUs. The best thing that you can do to solve this problem quickly is to reduce your processor power consumption.\n- Download and install\n[Intel Extreme Tuning Utility](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html). - Open the Basic Tuning section.\n- Set your Performance Core Ratio to 52x, 53x, 54x, or 55x.\n- Click Apply to roll out the changes.\n- Launch STALKER 2 to check whether the error is gone.\nThis should be the solution for the majority of players who encounter this problem. If it doesn’t work, you can try these other methods.\nUpdate BIOS\nIf you still encounter the out-of-video memory error, you may want to consider updating your BIOS. Since the steps of updating BIOS depends on the manufacturer, I can only offer a general guide to do this:\n- Go to your motherboard manufacturer’s official website.\n- Download the latest BIOS version for your model.\n- Copy the download file to a formatted USB drive.\n- Go to UEFI Firmware Settings from the Advanced Startup screen.\n- Search for the BIOS update option in the settings.\nUpdate Graphics Card Driver\nAnother method you can use to solve the out-of-video memory error is to update or even reinstall your Graphics Card Driver.\n- Open the Device Manager app.\n- Expand the Display adapters to find your Graphics Card.\n- Right-click and select the Update Driver option.\nVerify STALKER 2 Game Files\nAlthough unlikely, the out-of-video memory error could be caused by corrupted game files. In this instance, you may want to try to check the integrity of the game data.\n- Launch\n[Steam](https://thenerdstash.com/10-best-free-steam-games-in-2024/)and go to your Library. - Hover over STALKER 2 and right-click the title.\n- Select Properties and go to Installed Files.\n- Click the verify integrity of game files option.",

    "text": "今年中央一号文件提出，“发展森林食品，丰富‘森林粮库’”。森林是集水库、粮库、钱库、碳库于一体的大宝库，发展森林食物，不与粮争田、不与农争地，兼具生态效益、经济效益、社会效益，是构建多元化食物供给体系、保障国家粮食安全的重要举措。\n森林食品主要是指森林或者林地生产的食物，包括可食性果实、花、叶、枝、皮、根、脂液以及寄生物、附生物等非木质林产品。国家林业和草原局统计显示，全国森林食物年产量超过2亿吨，已经成为我国继粮食、蔬菜之后的第三大重要农产品，人均森林食物产量140公斤左右，居世界前列。开发森林食物不仅能丰富食物供给体系，调整改善大众食物营养体系科学配比，满足人民美好生活需要，还能为发展林下经济提供支撑点与发力点。\n开发森林食品尽管前景广阔，但也面临诸多现实问题。森林食品从产地到餐桌，历经许多环节，容易出现质量安全问题。例如，农药、兽药、杀虫剂的残留，以及非法滥用添加剂等问题，可能导致食物中毒，严重损害消费者健康。又如，规模化基础薄弱，受环境因素制约较多，不易实现一致性生产。此外，技术研发与深加工能力不足，多数森林食品处于初级加工阶段，附加值不高。高质量发展森林食品，需从多方面着手。\n制定发展规划，科学选择重点产业和发展目标。根据《“十四五”林业草原保护发展规划纲要》和《林草产业发展规划（2021—2025年）》，明确森林食物发展的目标和任务。根据需求情况，扩大油茶、油橄榄、仁用杏等木本油料种植面积，实施加快油茶产业发展行动，建设高标准油茶生产基地，改造提升低产林。稳定核桃、板栗、枣类种植面积，建设特色鲜明、集中连片、链条健全的优势产业带。积极发展林果、竹笋及可产饮料调料的经济林。规范发展林下种植养殖，推广林药、林菌、林菜、林下浆果等森林复合经营模式，积极发展林禽、林畜、林蜂等林下养殖，开发新型森林食品。\n加强科技创新和标准化生产。借鉴绿色食品的发展经验，建立健全森林食品标准体系，加强科技创新，推进品牌建设，完善产业链。确保森林食品在生产过程中严格控制有毒有害物质的使用，保持其原生态、无污染、健康、安全等特征。优质品种的培育可以提高产量、抗逆性和营养价值，降低生产成本，推动森林食品的规范化和规模化发展，要通过科技创新和科学育种，提升森林食品的品质和产量。开展木本粮油、优质饲草、经济林果、优良菌种等种源攻关，培育高产优质抗逆新品种。引导企业与科研院所合作，建设森林食物开发创新平台，研发推广新技术新装备。培育具有核心研发能力和产业带动力的森林食物开发科技企业。推广应用林下经济新品种、新技术、新成果，提高森林食品领域科研新成果、新技术转化效率。\n完善支持政策，加大资金投入。加强林区水、电、路、网等基础设施建设，改善森林食物生产条件。鼓励金融机构开发长周期、低利率的特色金融产品。鼓励林业科研机构、高校、企业协同发力，突破轻简化栽培、机械采收、精深加工等关键技术。加快推动产学研用深度融合。建立健全森林食品生产用地、财政资金、金融信贷等支持政策体系。进一步保障森林食物生产用地。支持利用低效茶园、低效人工商品林地、疏林地、灌木林地等各类适宜的非耕地国土资源，保障扩大油茶等木本粮油种植、改造提升低产林任务落地。完善森林食品溯源标准化体系建设。延伸森林食物产业链，提升森林食物价值链，强化组织化经营，逐步实现绿色化、特色化、品牌化的发展格局。 （作者：王 涛 来源：经济日报）",
