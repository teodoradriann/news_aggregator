    "text": "EL CAMPELLO. El Campello tiene en pausa el servicio de la Unidad de Prevención Comunitaria en Conductas Adictivas (UPCCA). El técnico que hasta el momento desempeñaba el servicio ha obtenido plaza en otra administración y el Ayuntamiento ha tenido que buscar una solución de personal.\nSolución que pasa por encontrar un profesional formado en UPCCA, lo que supone una problemática, porque \"no hay nadie en bolsa actualmente que cumpla con esos requisitos específicos\", ha informado la concejala de Servicios Sociales, Mari Carmen Alemañ, a preguntas del portavoz de Esquerra Unida-Unides Podem, Pedro Mario Pardo, en el pleno de junio.\nEs por ello que se prevé cubrir la plaza del UPCCA con personal del departamento de Servicios Sociales, \"que sí reúne una parte de los requisitos y la parte de la que carece se puede subsanar con formación complementaria\", ha asegurado la edil. Y ha insistido en que el técnico no tiene por qué ser \"un trabajador social, un psicólogo o una figura concreta; tiene que tener la formación de UPCCA\".\nPese a que un técnico municipal asuma esa sustitución, la concejala ha asegurado que \"no implicaría un daño en la estructura de Servicios Sociales\", por lo que no se prevé contratar más personal. \"No implicaría un agravio al equipo de Servicios Sociales\", ha subrayado.\nEl servicio de la UPCCA lleva en funcionamiento desde 2016 a través del Contrato Programa sufragado por la Conselleria de Servicios Sociales en la etapa del Botànic. Hasta el momento, se han implementado dos planes municipales de prevención de adicciones, porque cada cuatro años se van renovando. Por tanto, desde su inicio en 2016, la primera prórroga del servicio fue en 2020 y, la segunda, en 2024, la cual tendrá vigencia hasta 2028.\nSegún el portavoz de EU-UP, los dos planes obtuvieron una gran aceptación debido al apoyo que han significado para muchas familias con algún miembro con adicciones, la prevención en conductas adictivas en etapa escolar, las campañas de información en fiestas, la colaboración con el centro de salud por el abuso de ansiolíticos y otras adicciones. \"Así como un largo etcétera que nuestros vecinos y vecinas van a dejar de tener\".\nLa carencia de este servicio es \"una mala noticia\", como ha evidenciado Pardo, cuyo grupo municipal lamenta \"haber perdido un servicio tan importante\" para tantas familias, en especial con hijos e hijas en edad adolescente. Por ello, el grupo municipal exige que se adapten los puestos \"cuanto antes\" para recuperar este servicio municipal \"imprescindible para la salud\".\nEl concejal de izquierdas ha expresado su voluntad de que \"no ocurra como muchos otros servicios como el de voluntariado social que, a pesar de las reiteradas promesas por recuperarlo, han pasado dos años y seguimos sin contar con él. Siempre que gobierna el Partido Popular ocurre lo mismo: pérdida de derechos y desmantelamiento del Área de Bienestar social que tanto cuesta fortalecer y tan importante es\", ha manifestado.",

    "title": "Protests over Israel-Hamas war lead to hundreds of campus arrests | wltx.com",
    "text": "NEW YORK — Chaos erupted overnight as police tried to break up a pro-Palestinian encampment at Emerson College in Boston, the latest flashpoint in a growing movement on college campuses around the country protesting Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza . Hundreds of people have been arrested in Massachusetts, Texas and California during the tense protests, following several rounds of arrests in New York in recent days. At Emerson, 108 people were arrested and four police officers suffered injuries that were not life-threatening at the encampment, Boston police said Thursday. Those arrested were expected to appear in Boston Municipal Court. In nearby Cambridge, Harvard University had sought to stay ahead of protests this week by limiting access to Harvard Yard and requiring permission for tents and tables. That didn't stop protesters from setting up a camp with 14 tents Wednesday following a rally against the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee. Students protesting the Israel-Hamas war are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling its monthslong conflict. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus as graduation nears, partly prompting a heavier hand from universities. Harvard law student Tala Alfoqaha, who is Palestinian, said she and other protesters want more transparency from the university. \"My hope is that the Harvard administration listens to what its students have been asking for all year, which is divestment, disclosure and dropping any sort of charges against students,\" she said. USC protests Another 93 people were arrested Wednesday night during a protest at the University of Southern California and accused of trespassing, the Los Angeles Police Department said. There were no reports of injuries. Tensions were already high at USC after the university canceled a planned commencement speech by the school's pro-Palestinian valedictorian , citing safety concerns. After scuffles with police early Wednesday, a few dozen demonstrators standing in a circle with locked arms were detained one by one without incident later in the evening. Officers encircled the dwindling group sitting in defiance of an earlier warning to disperse or be arrested. Beyond the police line, hundreds of onlookers watched as helicopters buzzed overhead. The school closed the campus. \"Both sides of my family were displaced from Palestine, and I'm here using my voice because my grandparents couldn't,\" protester Randa Sweiss told CBS Los Angeles. In Northern California, students at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt , barricaded inside a building for a third day, and the school shut down campus through the weekend and made classes virtual. UT Austin protests At the University of Texas at Austin , hundreds of local and state police — including some on horseback and holding batons — moved against protesters Wednesday, at one point sending some tumbling into the street. Officers pushed their way into the crowd and made 34 arrests at the behest of the university and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, according to the state Department of Public Safety. A photographer covering the demonstration for Fox 7 Austin was in the push-and-pull when an officer yanked him backward to the ground, video shows. The station confirmed that the photographer was arrested. A longtime Texas journalist was knocked down in the mayhem and could be seen bleeding before police helped him to emergency medical staff. Dane Urquhart, a third-year Texas student, called the police presence and arrests an \"overreaction,\" adding that the protest \"would have stayed peaceful\" if the officers had not turned out in force. \"Because of all the arrests, I think a lot more (demonstrations) are going to happen,\" Urquhart said. Police left after hours of efforts to control the crowd, and about 300 demonstrators moved back in to sit on the grass and chant under the school's iconic clock tower. In a statement Wednesday night, the university's president, Jay Hartzell, said: \"Our rules matter, and they will be enforced. Our University will not be occupied.\" Columbia University protests While grappling with growing protests from coast to coast, schools have the added pressure of May commencement ceremonies coming up. At Columbia University in New York, students defiantly erected an encampment where many are set to graduate in front of families in just a few weeks. Columbia continued to negotiate with students after several failed attempts to clear the encampment and over 100 arrests in recent days. The university averted another confrontation between students and police Wednesday. University President Minouche Shafik had set on Tuesday a midnight deadline to reach an agreement on clearing an encampment, but the school extended negotiations for another 48 hours. On a visit to campus Wednesday, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson , a Republican, called on Shafik to resign \"if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos.\" He claimed the university is being taken over by a radical and extreme ideology, citing several recent incidents of antisemitic language by protesters on and off campus. \"We need the National Guard, law enforcement or someone to come in here and take control,\" Johnson told CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen. \"Desperate times call for desperate measures.\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul accused Johnson of politicizing the protest by coming to campus and said she has no plans to call in the National Guard for now. On Wednesday evening, a Columbia spokesperson said rumors that the university had threatened to bring in the National Guard were unfounded. \"Our focus is to restore order, and if we can get there through dialogue, we will,\" said Ben Chang, Columbia's vice president for communications. Columbia graduate student Omer Lubaton Granot, who put up pictures of Israeli hostages near the encampment, said he wanted to remind people that there were more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas. \"I see all the people behind me advocating for human rights,\" he said. \"I don't think they have one word to say about the fact that people their age, that were kidnapped from their homes or from a music festival in Israel, are held by a terror organization.\" On Wednesday about 60 tents remained at the Columbia encampment, which appeared calm. Security remained tight around campus, with identification required and police setting up metal barricades. Columbia said it had reached an agreement with protest representatives that only students would remain at the encampment, and that the protesters \"have taken steps to make the encampment welcome to all and have prohibited discriminatory or harassing language.\" Elsewhere in Manhattan, at New York University this week, police said 133 protesters were taken into custody. And on Monday, more than 40 protesters were arrested at an encampment at Yale University in Hew Haven, Connecticut, and charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor.",

    "text": "GOBankingRates 10 Best Free First Date Ideas To Save Money as a Single Person Read full article Nicole Spector December 29, 2023 at 12:00 a.m. · 5 min read jacoblund / Getty Images/iStockphoto\nDid you know that we’re in “cuffing season”? This is a period of time that, according to Merriam-Webster, starts in October and lasts until just after Valentine’s Day. It’s when single people are proactively seeking romantic partners to get cozy with during the colder months. So, it’s also the perfect time to consider some best first date ideas .\nBest Bank Account at U.S. Bank: A Checking Account With Perks and a Waivable Monthly Fee\nLearn: Pocket an Extra $403 Per Month With This Simple Hack\nYou needn’t let the prospect of cost discourage you either because, according to dating and relationship experts, there is no shortage of beautiful first dates that are not only cute and thoughtful — but also completely free. Let’s explore 10 options below .\nSponsored: Get Paid To Scroll. Start Now\nVisit the Library Book nerds rejoice. If you love to read — and your new potential mate does too — this is an awesome free first date idea.\n“Browsing through the aisles together while you gush over your favorite books in hushed tones is bound to bring you closer together,” said Jodie Milton, relationship and intimacy coach at Practical Intimacy . “Depending on where you live, there are some very impressive libraries with beautiful architecture and history to appreciate as well.”\nStargaze Arranging a date for the evening on a clear night? Stargazing is a top choice for could-be lovebirds.\n“This is a romantic option that invites deep conversation and an opportunity for physical connection as you snuggle underneath a blanket to look at the stars,” Milton said. “If you search for local stargazing spots in your area, you’ll find interesting lookouts to visit, or depending on where you live, your backyard might be the perfect spot.”\nI’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I Won’t Sell\nGo for a Hike Put your muscles to work while soaking up nature and enjoying laidback conversation. It will not only make the first date fun, it will help you feel less nervous about the whole thing.\nStory continues “Spending time in nature is known to reduce anxiety and promote calm, which can help with any first-date jitters,” Milton said. “Whether you live near a national park or you simply explore a local park, there are many beautiful areas to explore.”\nToss a Frisbee at the Beach or Park Another free date idea that is great for your mind, body and building romance is tossing a frisbee at your local beach or park.\n“Physical activity releases endorphins, which help to boost mood and increase attraction,” Milton said “Playing a low-stakes game like frisbee also allows for plenty of conversation. Being able to laugh, have fun together and not take yourself too seriously is an attractive quality.”\nVisit an Animal Shelter Who doesn’t love a day with mischievous felines and devoted dogs? Especially those who don’t yet have homes and could really use a snuggle. Visit an animal shelter!\n“This makes a beautiful first date if you are both animal lovers,” said Sandra Myers, co-founder and president of Select Date Society . “Sharing your love for animals will create a bond and likely put a smile on your faces as you cuddle up to furry friends.”\nPlay a Board Game Exercise those brain muscles and get a little competitive spirit in by playing a board game on your first date.\n“You can play a game at home, but on a first date you should opt for a public setting,” Myers said. “You can bring your game to a local café or park, or you can find a café that has a selection of board games. Bonding over a friendly competition makes for a fun first date!”\nHit the Gym Together This one is great for the athletic types!\n“If your gym offers members to bring a guest for free, invite your date to meet you for a workout,” Myers said. “This is a fun first date if you are both into fitness and truly enjoy getting in a good sweat!”\nVolunteer Together For those who want to do something kindhearted and charitable with their potential future significant other, get out in your community and make a difference — together. Not only is it free, it’s meaningful.\n“Bond over a shared sense of purpose by volunteering for a cause or community project,” said Sal Damiata, dating and relationships coach with Attraction Truth .\nDo a Scavenger Hunt This one is fun, exciting, and perhaps best of all, cost-effective! “The internet is full of ideas that can help you get started, and the hunts can be as simple or as complex as you’d like,” said Barbie Adler, president and founder of Selective Search .\n“Going to a public place such as a mall or a park, making a list of common sights (a person with a white dog, a person carrying groceries, a person talking on FaceTime, etc.), and racing to see who can get through their list first is one good example, as it is always dynamic and changing,” Adler said. “Alternatively, for a more romantic twist, you can ditch the competitive aspect and have one partner make a hunt for the other, preferably with a romantic surprise of some kind at the end. This can also be a really fun, low-cost option for a double date.”\nPack a Picnic Basket “There is something warm, nostalgic and simple about packing a picnic basket (or wine and cheese basket), spreading out a blanket, and sitting in a park or on a beach together to enjoy the outdoors and great conversation,” Myers said. “You can’t go wrong with this one.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nYou Can Get These 3 Debts Canceled Forever\nNever Pay These 8 Bills With Cash or a Check\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHow to Earn an Extra $500 a Year on Your Savings\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : 10 Best Free First Date Ideas To Save Money as a Single Person\nTRENDING 1.
