    "text": "Switching Candidates Doesn’t Matter. What We Need Is A Cleantech-Led Abandonment of the Politics of Fear. [daily news updates from CleanTechnica](https://mailchi.mp/cleantechnica/daily-newsletter)on email. Or [follow us on Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLQgKIidDQklTRndnTWFoTUtFV05zWldGdWRHVmphRzVwWTJFdVkyOXRLQUFQAQ)! If you’re a regular reader, you’ve probably noticed me spending some time on politics, policy, and [theories on how we can move forward on what appears to be an intractable problem](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/07/18/clean-technology-should-be-fixing-bad-government-not-funding-it/). If you’re sick of this topic, I feel you! Politics has become so nasty, so divisive, and even violent at times. There’s so much negativity and even hatred in it now. Gone are the days when political rivals would meet up for golf or coffee, and now we’re in the days when people are trying to put each other in prison (deserved or not). As this ugly election year drags on and gets uglier, we’re at a point where there are constant rumors that Joe Biden is going to drop out of the race. By the time this is published, that may have happened, and we could be on the way to seeing the Democratic Party try to find another candidate who can beat Trump in November. Or, we could see Biden (yet again) refuse to stand aside. Everyone has their favorite replacement for Biden. Kamala Harris is a big name, as she’s VP. Everyone else in a governor’s seat, in the Senate, and in the cabinet has been mentioned as an alternative. Arguments over who can poll well, who can energize the party, and who can nail Trump to the floor in debates have all come up, and many of these arguments have merit. But, the more I think about this, the more I realize that one big thing will not change, no matter who serves as the new face of the Democratic Party: the negativity. While each candidate can articulate arguments about how things have been good when they were in office, and lay out a vision for the future, that doesn’t come up much. As usual in today’s politics, they’re only trying to lay out why they’re less bad than the other guy. This “lesser of two evils” situation has been going on for decades, and has led us all down the road to the evil of two lessers, with the candidate quality declining more with each presidential election. Even as recently as 2009 and 2012, we saw Barack Obama campaign on “Hope and Change,” but that feels like an alternate universe now. Switching out the face of the Democratic Party without toning down the negativity in favor of a grand vision for a better future would leave most voters feeling like politics is still not worth engaging in. About the only benefit to switching a face out would be that a new person might be able to run on “reform” and improvement (something an incumbent can’t do). What We Need: A Stagnation-Breaking Vision For The Future To break out from the negativity, either Biden or a new candidate needs to start getting people to think very positively. Yes, Trump is a guy who could become a big damned problem if he gets into office again, but laying out a vision for the future that’s even better than today would throw the guy into even sharper contrast. However, today’s political alignments and competitions get in the way of a grand future. We’re too busy worrying about things like socialism vs. capitalism, tradition vs. progress, and other ancient struggles. Instead of realizing that it’s the 21st century and trying to look forward to the 22nd and 23rd centuries, we’re instead stuck in the 18th and 19th centuries with the same old song on repeat. It’s time to propose some radical but palatable new policies and goals for society that catch traditionalists and reactionaries flat-footed while actually inspiring people to join the effort instead of hesitantly casting a vote while holding their noses. Clean Technology Can Be A Key Part Of A Grand Vision For A Better Life One thing the Republican Party has going for it is that looking to the past can make people feel comfortable. Telling people that they don’t have to adjust to anything new makes people feel more at home. Most people have been okay fueling up the cars every week or two, going to stable corporate jobs, and having kids who don’t dare switch genders on them. Trump is smart to promise people that the world won’t change on his watch, because that means most people will be in their comfort zone. Sadly, the clean technology counterargument is the old THE END IS NIGH argument. Climate change is not only coming, but it’s already here, and it’s causing lots of problems. To solve it and prevent extreme destruction, people need to depart their comfort zone, learn to fuel their vehicle a different way, and shell out money for a solar panel loan every month instead of just paying the electric bill. This argument asks busy people to do something, while Trump’s argument is that doomsday is not coming, and that you can just do what you’re already comfortable doing. Instead of casting this as an effort to avoid doomsday, Democrats (whoever the face is) need to instead promise a better experience, much like Tesla did for most of the 2010s. Instead of selling a tough solution to doomsday, cars that were more fun, cheaper to operate, and could be fueled at home were promised, and people eventually wanted them! Instead of selling medicine, we should be selling delicious coffee and energy drinks! People should be given a vision for a world with better cars, more stable electric grids, freedom from power outages, lower costs, and more personal control over their lives. The same can be applied to everything from e-bikes to improved electric public transit and high-speed rail. Other Ways To Break Stagnation This idea of selling people on the benefits of an amazing future instead of selling people on avoiding something terrible can be applied across politics to so many more things. Instead of appealing to jealousy with “eat the rich,” why not try to sell people on the many proven benefits from universal basic income? Instead of trying to sell people on taking their guns away, why not focus on making the world a place where nobody feels the need to pick up a weapon and kill innocent people to get attention (via things like UBI, access to healthcare, and cheaper housing). Instead of selling people on “15 minute cities” that make people feel like they’d be trapped in urban hell, instead sell people on “The city of the future, where you can go ANYWHERE, and FAST.” At the end of the day, trying to get Americans to take their medicine will not work. Trying to get people to join an ice cream party could work a LOT better. Have a tip for CleanTechnica? Want to advertise? Want to suggest a guest for our CleanTech Talk podcast?

    "text": "(Reuters) - Russian forces repeatedly shelled a settlement west of the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson on Thursday, killing one person and wounding another, the region's governor said.\nVyacheslav Prokudin, governor of Kherson region, still partly held by Russian forces, said on Telegram that the woman died when Russian forces hit the village of Tomyna Balka six times.\nOutside Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, a strike by Russian multiple rocket launchers triggered a fire engulfing at least six homes in the town of Slatyne, local official Vyacheslav Zadorenko said.\nZadorenko said emergency services were tackling the blaze and trying to establish whether any residents were trapped under rubble. Kharkiv, located 30 km (18 miles) from the border, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks.\nReuters could not verify the reports independently.\nRussia says it does not target civilians, though thousands have died in the more than 2-1/2 years since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n(Reporting by Ron Popeski; Editing by Jamie Freed)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

A spokesperson added: \"In order to dry the wet sprouts Tesco worked with growers to develop a new innovative drying method, using cool air blowers to literally blow the water off them in their storage pallets.\" Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp [Click this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LU5TE4vC7DOJ3M6yruB11W) or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

    "title": "A&E spike in complaints such as fainting while urinating and stuck 'foreign objects'",
    "text": "A&E departments are seeing a rise in people attending with unusual or delicate complaints such as fainting while urinating, prolonged erections and being unable to remove a \"foreign object\" from an intimate area, new figures show.\nData for England, analysed by the PA news agency, shows there has been an increase in the number of people seeking help for broken penises, a burning sensation when passing urine and sexually transmitted infections. Leading emergency doctors said that A&E staff are trained to help people with potentially embarrassing problems with \"confidence and respect\" and urged people not to put off seeking help when needed.\nAttendances for so-called \"penis problems\" rose by 34% from 13,911 in 2021/22 to 18,592 in 2022/23, and last year some 20,675 women went to A&E for \"vagina problems\", a 30% rise on 15,930 in 2021/22. In 2022/23 some 73,300 patients had a procedure to remove a foreign object after attending A&E.\nWhile these figures will also include removal of objects in other orifices including eyes, noses and ears, the data shows that there were 1,502 attendances for \"foreign body in rectum\" and 5,421 people attended due to a \"foreign body in the vagina\". Elsewhere the figures show a 9% rise in A&E attendances for priapism - a prolonged erection of the penis - with some 373 men needing help for this painful condition last year, up from 342 in 2021/22 and 272 in 2020/21.\nThe NHS website offers tips on how to initially treat priapism at home including a warm bath or shower, going for a gentle walk, urinating, drinking lots of water or exercises such as squats or running on the spot. It warns that icepacks can \"make things worse\" and urged men with the condition not to have sex or masturbate.\nPeople are urged to seek urgent medical care if the condition lasts for more than two hours to \"avoid permanent damage to the penis\". Meanwhile some 432 men were seen in emergency rooms in 2022/23 due to \"rupture of corpus cavernosum of penis\" - also know as a \"fracture of the penis\" - an uncommon injury which occurs in an erect penis.\nThis represents a 25% rise on the previous year when there were 346 men seen for this condition. The data also shows that some 1,593 people attended an A&E department in England last year because of \"postcoital bleeding\". Doctors also saw a 14% rise in the number of men who sought help for hydrocele - a condition where the scrotum becomes filled with fluid, causing it to swell and make it feel like a water balloon.\nThis accounted for some 2,276 attendances last year, up from 1,988 the previous year. The data further reveals that 2,392 people were treated in A&Es last year for micturition syncope - a condition which causes people to feeling dizzy or light-headed, or having short-lived loss of consciousness when passing urine.\nAlso in 2022/23:\nMore than 140,000 people went to English A&Es due to dysuria - a burning, itching or painful sensation when urinating. Some 5,728 attended due to phimosis - the inability to retract the foreskin covering the head of the penis. There were 737 attendances with symptoms of gonorrhoea, 1,191 for chlamydia. Some 12,000 sought help for thrush. There has been an almost eight-fold rise in people seeking emergency care due to \"caffeine poisoning\". A total of 142 people sought help for caffeine toxicity in 2022/23, compared to just 18 the year before.\nThe figures show emergency doctors have seen a rise in illnesses which many people would assume have been eradicated in the UK. Cases of smallpox rose from three in 2020/21 to seven in 2021/22 to 50 in 2022/23. And 215 people were diagnosed with typhoid fever last year, more than double the 94 cases in 2021/22.\nBut the number of people diagnosed with plague fell from 95 in 2021/22 to 36 in 2022/23. Earlier this year, separate PA analysis found that there was a rise in visits to emergency departments for complaints including sore throats, hiccups, coughs and earache.\nOverall, some 8.6 million A&E attendances in 2022/23 resulted in the patient being discharged with written advice. Hundreds of thousands of people walked out of emergency departments before their condition could be diagnosed, however. Some 624,367 patients walked out before a first diagnosis in 2022/23, a 22% rise on the year before when 510,553 left before being told what was wrong with them.\nCommenting on the figures, Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"People attend A&Es with an array of issues, including some potentially embarrassing problems. Staff are trained to approach these problems confidentially and with respect.\n\"It is vital that if patients are concerned about something and feel they need urgent or emergency care, they should come to A&E. We don't want patients with potentially important problems to feel deterred. Some symptoms may be signs of a more serious problem, and coming to A&E may be what is needed to diagnose that and receive the necessary and appropriate treatment.\"\nDr Tim Cooksley, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, added: \"This data further shows the diversity of presentations that NHS teams manage every day. Fundamentally, these patients have urgent conditions that need timely, respectable care and, as for so many patients currently, this cannot be achieved in overwhelmed urgent and emergency care environments which are extremely distressing for patients.\"",

    "text": "La Asociación Trabajadores del Estado (ATE) se movilizó este jueves en Argentina frente al Ministerio de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado, conducido por Federico Sturzenegger; ante la amenaza de 50.000 cesantías en la Administración Pública.\nAsimismo, protestaron contra el congelamiento de las paritarias y la nueva disposición del Gobierno de aumentarles el sueldo a los funcionarios que despidan más trabajadores.\n- Te puede interesar:\nLa Asociación de Trabajadores convoca a paro nacional en Argentina\nEl secretario general de ATE Nacional, Rodolfo Aguiar, precisó; “Tenemos que aceptar que en nuestro país el Estado ha sido colonizado por los empresarios y que ya casi no quedan rastros de institucionalidad. El único lenguaje que entiende esta gente es la fuerza. Tenemos que seguir aumentando la conflictividad, desgastando antes de que dejen en la Argentina sólo tierra arrasada”.\nEntre los reclamos también se exige la reincorporación de trabajadoras y trabajadores despedidos de manera ilegal, así como el rechazo a la privatización de empresas públicas.\nProtestas en Argentina\nDe igual manera, rechazan la fusión y el cierre de organismos. Otros pedidos incluyen un aumento de emergencia para jubiladas y jubilados, la restitución del Fondo de Garantía de Sustentabilidad (FGS) de la ANSES, la reactivación de la moratoria previsional y la normalización del Instituto Nacional de Servicios Sociales para Jubilados y Pensionados (INSSJyP).\nDesde la página oficial de ATE declararon que “durante la medida de fuerza, que tuvo un 90 % de adhesión en todo el país, el sindicato definió mediante votación la realización de un nuevo paro de 36 horas, que comenzará al mediodía del miércoles 9 de abril y se extenderá hasta la medianoche del jueves 10, día en que convocaron a parar las centrales obreras, siendo ATE integrante de la CTA Autónoma”.\nTras la marcha, en la que las fuerzas de seguridad aplicaron el protocolo antipiquetes, Rodolfo Aguiar confirmó que los estatales se plegarán al paro convocado por la CGT.\n📢 “El único lenguaje que entiende esta gente es la fuerza. Tenemos que seguir aumentando la conflictividad, desgastando antes que dejen en la Argentina sólo tierra arrasada”, señaló Rodolfo Aguiar.\n— Prensa ATE Nacional (@ateprensa)\n[March 27, 2025]\n“El único lenguaje que entiende esta gente es la fuerza”, remarcó Aguiar, y agregó: “Tenemos que aceptar que en nuestro país el Estado ha sido colonizado por los empresarios y que ya casi no quedan rastros de institucionalidad. Los estatales se movilizaron masivamente en todo el país. Tenemos que seguir aumentando la conflictividad, desgastando antes de que dejen en la Argentina sólo tierra arrasada”.\nAl insistir en que “está claro que el programa económico del Gobierno fracasa y que los que van a tomar nueva deuda con el FMI son los mismos de 2018 y lo quieren para lo mismo, para fugársela”; el sindicalista subrayó que “el acuerdo con el Fondo es más deuda y será más ajuste. Los que firmen ese entendimiento tienen que terminar presos”.",
