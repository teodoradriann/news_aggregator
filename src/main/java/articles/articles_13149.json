    "text": "New York’s top court allows ‘equal rights’ amendment to appear on November ballot\nPosted Jul 11, 2024 03:56:18 04:41:00 PM.\nA\nproposed amendment to New York’s constitution to bar discrimination over “gender identity” and “pregnancy outcomes” will appear on the ballot this November, the state’s high court ruled Thursday.\nThe decision from the Court of Appeals affirms a lower court ruling from June, dismissing an appeal “upon the ground that no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.”\nDemocrats are hoping the ballot question will drive turnout in their favor this fall as the party frames the “equal rights” amendment as a way to protect abortion rights.\nRepublicans also have begun to strategize around the proposed amendment, moving to animate voters against the protections it might offer to transgender people.\nA Republican state lawmaker had sued to block the ballot question, arguing that Democrats in the Legislature made a technical error when passing the amendment.\nThe state’s Constitution currently bans discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion. The proposed amendment would add ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care and autonomy.\nIt would not explicitly protect abortion rights in New York, where access to the procedure is already considered very safe. Instead, the proposed amendment would stop a person from being discriminated against for having an abortion.\nThe ballot question has been a crucial part of Democrats’ election strategy in New York. The party has tried to center key House races in New York on abortion access, warning voters that Republicans would try to curtail access to the procedure and betting that Democrats would cast ballots to protect abortion rights after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\nRepublicans in turn have moved to use the proposed amendment to energize their base, with some officials arguing it would allow minors to access gender-affirming health care without parental notification. Supporters of the ballot question have said it would not impact a parent’s involvement in such medical decisions.\nAnthony Izaguirre, ",

    "text": "Manchester tornado leaves family safe amid chaos and damage (Image: Getty) A family have spoken of their miracle escape from a tornado raging at up to 160mph which tore their home apart.\nGareth Moody said that they were “lucky to be alive” after a chimney crashed through his son’s bedroom ceiling, missing him by “centimetres” but wrecking the family’s three-storey house in Greater Manchester.\nThe council licensing worker, his wife Lyndsey, their three children and son-in-law fled to safety through the remains of the Stalybridge home to find their street had been turned into a “bomb site”.\nAround 100 homes were damaged as the Storm Gerrit twister caused mayhem, destroying cars and uprooting trees.\nThe weather phenomenon that hit Greater Manchester has been provisionally labelled as a T5 tornado by officials.\nConfirmation came from the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation following a site investigation and review.\nThe twisters are assessed on a scale from 0 to 10, with five considered “intense”.\nAccording to the International Tornado Intensity Scale, a T5 has a wind speed of 137 to 160mph.\nAlthough it is rare to hear of them in the UK, meteorologists have said tornadoes can occur regularly across the nation.\nA Met Office spokesman said: “Tornadoes in the UK are fairly common. Around 30 are reported a year, and can often occur at this time of year.\"\n“However, they’re usually short-lived events or occur in places where they can’t create much of a tangible impact.”\nThe weather experts describe a tornado as a rapidly rotating column of air that reaches between the base of a storm cloud and the ground.\nThey form in very unsettled weather conditions as part of severe thunderstorms.\nA violently whirling mass of air, known as a vortex, forms beneath the storm cloud. A funnel cloud then develops as the vortex spins due to the reduced pressure.\nIt is thought this twister was caused by a supercell thunderstorm, a squall that exhibits persistent and deep rotation.\nTrending\n The Moodys were in their front bedroom when what police called a “localised tornado” struck at 11.30pm on Wednesday.\nGareth, 45, said: “There was a massive crash so I got up. I went to the back door because I wanted to make sure everything was safe, when there was another crash and the lights went out.\n“I ran back upstairs and looked up to see a huge, gaping hole in the ceiling. It was completely gone.\n“It was mayhem, bedlam. The chimney stack from next door had been blown out and came through our roof. We managed to get my daughter, son-in-law and our two sons out into the street.\"\n“I think we are lucky to be alive. The boys are especially lucky because the chimney stack crashed into one of their bedrooms. It’s a miracle that no one was killed.”\nGareth added: “The chimney stack is actually in my son’s room in one whole piece and missed him by centimetres.”\nNurse Lyndsey, 45, added yesterday: “It had started hailstoning...the whole house was shaking and the wind was howling.\n“I went to look out of the window, which seemed like it was being sucked out by the wind. As I turned round to move away the whole ceiling just came down. I screamed and then the hallway literally gave way.\"\n“The chimney came down and took out the rest of the house.”\nThe couple’s sons Thomas, 15, and Jack, 22, were in their upstairs bedrooms when the roof and chimney fell into Jack’s room.\nGareth said: “My wife was screaming and my two lads were in a panic. I was saying, ‘We have to get out, we have to get out’.\n“We managed to escape and everyone is safe. But it feels like death because this is everything we have worked for.”\nThe couple’s daughter Rebecca Saycell, 20, and her husband Thomas, 27, fled their basement bedroom, while dogs Phoebe and Penny plus cat Jesse escaped too.\nRebecca said: “We got outside and saw that our roof had gone. All the cars in the road were covered with rubble.”\nLyndsey said: “It was like something from a film. You could hear the whirl of it and then it was gone. How do we fix that...where are we going to live?”\nThe village of Carrbrook was also badly hit by the whirlwind. Electrician Richard Harrison, 52, yesterday looked at a roof tile embedded in the boot of his £30,000 three-month-old Vauxhall Grandland car and said: “I honestly thought a plane had come down because we are on the flight path into Manchester Airport.\"\nREAD MORE Storm Gerrit leaves thousands of homes without power as it causes chaos\n“It is an absolute miracle that no one was killed because I dread to think what could have happened if the tornado had hit in the daytime with people on the streets.\"\n“There were roof and ridge tiles flying all over the place. You can tell the strength of the wind by looking at the tile in my car.\"\n“It took some force to do that. It was unbelievable. I’ve never seen anything like it. The street looks like a bomb site with debris all over. Some people’s houses have been totally wrecked.”\nGreater Manchester Police chiefs declared a “major incident” as officers were called out to “numerous reports of significant damage”.\nResidents of the Hough Hill Road area of Stalybridge, in the foothills of the Pennines, yesterday relived the horror of the storm’s 30-second blitz of destruction.\nAndy Turner said: “There was what I can only describe as a hurricane which came through. My wife’s car is a write-off, my car’s took a bit of the brunt of the tree.\"\n“It’s just lucky that nobody was hurt. It was pure carnage.”\nAndy Wareham’s Tesla had its windscreen smashed. He said: “Things started flying around. There was about 30 seconds to a minute of chaos and then it calmed down. Straight away I said, ‘It must have been a tornado’.”\nREAD MORE\nMet Office gives unsettling weather warning as UK to be engulfed by -8C storm The UK is facing severely unsettled weather conditions - and a fierce drop in temperatures is set to hit later in the week. The country has been painted yellow in weather warnings as the Met Office warns of brutal winds and icy showers.\nWinds could reach as high as 130kmph in Scotland .\nMatthew Marsland, who lives opposite houses that were badly damaged, said: “I just heard an extreme noise. I was stood at the patio doors and there was basically a crazy sounding noise.”\nThe privately-backed Tornado and Storm Research Organisation said site investigations would be required to confirm the damage was caused by a rare UK tornado.\nChief Superintendent Mark Dexter, of Greater Manchester Police, said: “This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night.\"\n“Our highest priority is keeping people safe which is why we are advising those who have been displaced not to return or enter their properties which have significant damage until they have been assessed by structural engineers.”\nA Met Office spokesman said that early reports from the area indicated that “a tornado at the surface was likely” to be the cause of the destruction.\nThree men inside a 4x4 which plunged into a river yesterday afternoon (thurs dec 28), according to the police.\nFirefighters pulled the vehicle from the River Esk near Glaisdale on the North York Moors yesterday afternoon.\nA fourth man who attempted to save the people inside the vehicle had to be pulled to safety himself and was later receiving medical treatment. The dead men’s next of kin were last night being traced and informed about the tragedy.\nA spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said that further information about the fatal accident would be released in due course.\nA family are “lucky to be alive” after a tornado tore the roof off their house forcing them to scramble to safety over the wreckage.\nRoofs were torn off houses, trees blew down and walls collapsed as twister ripped through Greater Manchester during Storm Gerrit.\nGareth Moody, 45, said it is “a miracle that no one was killed” after a chimney stack crashed through his son’s bedroom celiling destroying their home.\nThe council worker, his wife Lyndsey, also 45, and three of of their children had to clamber over smashed bricks, timber and broken tiles to escape.\nRelated articles Busy UK motorway descends into chaos after 'serious' crash closes it Weather map suggests New Years Eve deluge to smash UK and spark chaos Gerrit storm batters UK with deadly weather as urgent warnings made to drivers Heart-stopping moment plane avoids horrific crash at Heathrow amid storm chaos BBC warns snow and storm chaos to batter Britain again in new forecast",

    "text": "Read full article Local Journalism Initiative Conspiracists and democratic deficits collide in Alberta municipal governments Local Journalism Initiative June 7, 2024 at 12:51 a.m. · 3 min read Link Copied\nIn his time in municipal government, Paul McLauchlin, reeve of Ponoka County and president of the Rural Municipalities of Alberta, has heard it all. That his colleagues are shills for the World Economic Forum (WEF). That he’s really doing the bidding of the United Nations.\nMcLauchlin can laugh about these accusations, saying the majority of constituents recognize the work of municipal leaders revolves around infrastructure and the provision of goods and services.\nBut there is a fairly loud, and increasingly hostile, minority spurred on by misinformation and conspiracy belief who he says have caused “a lot of harm to municipal politics in some circles.”\n“It's a very tough time to be a municipal leader in this world of polarized toxicity,” he said.\n“It's a pretty big mental health strain on people when you're dealing with the level of bullying and aggressiveness you're seeing out there.”\nMunicipal leaders across Canada have been subject to a wave of harassment, from nuisance phone calls to groups hijacking protests to threats of violence.\nOn the lower end of seriousness, having to counter conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation takes time away from the material concerns of municipal councils. At the other extreme, belief in a global conspiracy creates an environment where anti-authority, xenophobic, and outright antisemitic groups can gain influence.\nThe antagonistic political culture is also contributing to staff turnover in municipal government. In February, Quebec launched a helpline for elected officials following hundreds of resignations. And the average tenure for chief administrative officers in Alberta is now less than a single council term.\n“Many of the folks that I’ve seen be bullied; all they're trying to do is make land-use decisions on behalf of their communities. And it's quite sad that we're at this stage,” McLauchlin said.\nLand use and development decisions are at the heart of municipal government. In the mirror world of conspiracy theorists, municipal planning is at the core of the \"globalist blueprint\" that is Agenda 21, or the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nAt the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, leaders of 178 nations signed a document known as Agenda 21. The planning paper contains goals for sustainable development, conservation, and combating global poverty. It is not a treaty and has no enforcement mechanisms or penalties.\nDespite its limited scope and power, the John Birch Society and other radical right groups have recast Agenda 21 as the linchpin in a secret plot to impose a totalitarian one-world government that would erode national sovereignty, decimate rural populations, and enact mass depopulation schemes.\nBuilding on decades of work that followed the 1992 Rio de Janeiro summit, an updated framework of 17 development goals , the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, was adopted by UN member states in 2015, and incorporated into existing conspiracy theories soon after.\nThe all-encompassing Agenda 21/2030 theory is now entrenched in online conspiracy culture, where it serves as an explanation for many world events, from pandemic immunization efforts to municipal council decisions on public transit or the colour of crosswalks.\nIn some ways, the convergence of misinformation and local politics is a “post-COVID hangover,” but the issue has been building for a while, McLauchlin said.\n“I think that there is a small vocal minority that are being fed algorithms through their social media channels. And those algorithms are based upon memes that are not tied to the reality of what is going on,” he said.\n“The struggle of democracy we have right now is that fact and truth have become questionable. And some people start to believe in things that aren't really based upon fact.”\nA rainbow crosswalk in Westlock became a flashpoint for a local activist claiming it was part of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda.
