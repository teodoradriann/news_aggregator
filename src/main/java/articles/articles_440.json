    "text": "Suns Could Have Coach of the Year PHOENIX -- Phoenix Suns head coach Mike Budenholzer arrives to the Valley with expectations to help bolster the team's star-studded roster and its chances of making a deep postseason push in the 2024-25 season. Budenholzer - a two-time Coach of the Year and NBA Champion - takes over for previous head man Frank Vogel, who was fired after just his first year on the job. The Suns are now on their third head coach in as many seasons, though they believe Budenholzer has the right qualities to emerge as the man in the Valley and maximize their championship window. [Oddsshark.com ](https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/phoenix-suns-2025-season-preview-betting-odds)believes Budenholzer's a good bet to win NBA Coach of the Year once again with his new team. \"Only Don Nelson, Gregg Popovich, and Pat Riley have won Coach of the Year on three occasions, so another trophy on Budenholzer's mantle would put him in that prestigious group,\" wrote Chris Walder. \"Mark Daigneault just won with the Thunder after guiding the team to an improvement of +.207 in the standings, but in order for Phoenix to achieve similar growth, it would need to win over 65 games and that's simply not happening. Voters tend to gravitate towards sharp and noticeable jumps in the win-loss column, although when former Suns coach Monty Williams won in 2022, it was only by .072. \"Expectations are smack dab in the middle for Phoenix, because while we all can see them being a viable threat for Larry O'Brien, it's not out of the realm of possibility to see this experiment bottom out quickly. However, Budenholzer is too good a coach and this core is far too strong when healthy to see that come to fruition, so if the Suns can keep themselves in the thick of it and maybe improve by five-plus wins, then Coach of the Year is absolutely on the table here.\" Budenholzer's first opportunity to place his fingerprints on the Suns will come later this month as training camp begins, with preseason festivities closely following at the beginning of October.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — The National Park Service and American Forests have signed a five-year agreement to help return threatened whitebark pine to its range in the western U.S., including Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and other parts of Wyoming.\nAs part of President Joe Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the partnership will support restoration activities in national parks where whitebark pine grows. Initial projects in Yellowstone, Glacier and Grand Teton National Parks are part of\n$44 million in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate and conservation investment in history.\nThrough the Investing in America agenda, the Department of the Interior is implementing more than $2 billion in investments to restore our nation’s lands and waters and advance the\nAmerica the Beautiful initiative to restore and conserve 30% of lands and waters by 2030.\nTo guide these historic investments, the Department released a\nrestoration and resilience framework to support coordination across agency restoration and resiliency programs and drive transformational outcomes. This includes a commitment to the National Seed Strategy, which aims to foster inter-agency and public-private collaboration to increase the supply of native seeds available for timely and effective restoration.\nListed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2022, whitebark pine is a keystone species that is vital to many high-elevation ecosystems in North America. Its seeds are a high-calorie food source for more than 19 animal species, including Clark’s nutcrackers and grizzly bears. Additionally, whitebark pine forests are vital to the health of streams and rivers – regulating the flow of snowmelt that supplies downstream watersheds.\n“The National Seed Strategy spotlights how successful native plant restoration starts with having access to the rights seeds,” NPS Director Chuck Sams said. “Our agreement with American Forests will enable the collection of seeds from drought and disease resistant whitebark pines and ultimately help us to restore these trees in national parks.”\nWhitebark pine numbers have been rapidly declining due to disease, pests and climate change. It is estimated that more than 325 million whitebark pine have been lost across their range. White pine blister rust, an invasive fungal disease that forms deadly cankers, is among the greatest threats to the high-elevation conifer.\nAmerican Forests is working with NPS to identify and implement projects guided by the National Whitebark Pine Restoration Plan — a science-informed strategy that identifies core restoration areas and actions needed to conserve whitebark pine.\nThe plan was developed in partnership by American Forests with the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation, the U.S Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service, Department bureaus including the Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service, and numerous Tribal land managers.\n“This agreement is a pivotal step toward preserving the biodiversity and health of whitebark pine and its vital ecosystems,” said Brian Kittler, forest restoration lead with American Forests. “National parks are not just places to be enjoyed for their beauty and history, they also harbor vital habitat for the whitebark pine and other species in decline. Together, American Forests and the National Park Service are advancing the state of the science for conserving this life-giving tree.”\nIn Yellowstone, Glacier and Grand Teton National Parks, American Forests is collaborating with land managers to pioneer direct seeding trials. The method, which involves planting seeds directly into the ground, as opposed to planting seedlings grown in greenhouses, may offer a low-impact and cost-effective alternative to restore whitebark pine in remote locations.\nAmerican Forests is also partnering with Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks to identify and harvest cones from drought and disease-resistant whitebark pine trees. Seeds from resistant parent trees will be screened and cultivated to grow the next generation of climate-resilient forests in California.\nThe agreement will support future projects to come, as American Forests and national parks throughout the western U.S. continue to identify restoration opportunities.\nAmerican Forests is the first national nonprofit conservation organization created in the U.S. Since its founding in 1875, the organization has been the pathfinders for the forest conservation movement. Its mission is to create healthy and resilient forests, from cities to large natural landscapes, that deliver essential benefits for climate, people, water and wildlife.\nTo learn more about national efforts to protect and restore whitebark pine, visit\nSavetheWhitebarkPine.org.",

LAPRESSE LW 30/08/2024 - 10:45 CDT\nCompartir en Facebook\nCompartir en Twitter\nCompartir en Telegram\nCompartir en Whatsapp\nEnviar por email Celebrities. Jennifer Lopez, seen for the first time after her divorce alone in the mansion she is selling with Ben Affleck: It's really hit her hard Celebrities. Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck move forward with their divorce: U-Haul truck spotted at their Beverly Hills mansion Ben Affleck is a bit worried about how Jennifer Lopez is spoiling the kids, even though he appreciates her strong bond with them. It seems like their parenting styles just don't quite match up . According to an insider, Affleck feels that Lopez's approach is too lenient and lacks the necessary discipline that kids need while growing up. It's no surprise that they had disagreements over this during their time together.\nEven though their fairytale love story has come to an end, Affleck's kids are still very attached to their stepmom . Especially his oldest daughter, Violet, who's often seen hanging out with Lopez and going to restaurants. It's a tricky situation for Affleck as they head towards divorce.\nJennifer Lopez and stepdaughter Violet Affleck enjoy a walk together A source told InTouch Weekly that Ben Affleck isn't too thrilled about how much Jennifer Lopez spoils their kids and disrupts his usual traditional way of raising them. The insider mentioned, \" They have always had vastly different styles of parenting. Ben spoils them from time to time and gives them their favourite treats, but J. Lo really showers them with gifts like nobody's business. \"\nBen worries Jennifer's leniency may spoil their kids It's clear that Affleck is grateful for the way Lopez has embraced his family and kids, as well as the strong bond she has with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner . However, it seems like she's more of a \" Disneyland stepmom \" in his eyes. The source also mentioned, \" She's always picking up treats for them, she always seems to know just what will make them happy, and she gets a real kick out of making them smile .\"\nIt's not all bad though. Despite their differences in parenting styles, it's evident that both Affleck and Lopez care deeply for the kids . Affleck might be a bit concerned about the spoiling, but he also appreciates the strong bond Lopez shares with the children.\nIn the midst of all this, Jennifer Lopez seems to be enjoying some downtime in the Hamptons, indulging in her love for gardening. Meanwhile, Ben Affleck spent the Fourth of July with the kids in LA. It's good to see that they're both finding ways to spend quality time with the kids, despite their differences.",

    "text": "Tras un año lleno de trabajo, compromisos y eventos, Mirtha Legrand se tomó los primeros días del 2024 para relajarse y vivir el verano y el glamour de Mar del Plata. La diva disfruta de la gastronomía, los paseos y las obras que ofrece la ciudad. Por esa razón, asistió al show teatral musical “Bossi Live Comedy”, protagonizado por Martín Bossi, donde fue invitada de honor del actor y recibió un regalo que la hizo emocionar hasta las lágrimas.\n[Te puede interesar: Después de la polémica, Mirtha Legrand fue a ver a Fátima Flórez en Mar del Plata: “Ha nacido una estrella”](/teleshow/2024/01/06/despues-de-la-polemica-mirtha-legrand-fue-a-ver-a-fatima-florez-en-mar-del-plata-ha-nacido-una-estrella/)\nLuego de un show de dos horas, donde el cómico hizo reír, cantar y bailar al público, llegó el momento especial de la noche. A pocos minutos de finalizar el espectáculo, Bossi se acercó por sorpresa hasta donde estaba Mirtha Legrand y le cantó el tema ‘Yo no soy tu prisionero’.\nBajo las luces de la sala y ante la vista de todos los presentes, Legrand se emocionó hasta las lágrimas. “Te tengo que decir una cosa. Te prometí mariachis. La fanfarria Alto Perú, íbamos a cortar la calle. Pero ahorita no podemos cortar porque el que corta no cobra. Así que conformate con los churros (le regaló una bolsa de churros). Tenés una gran mesa acá de mil personas que te aman. Compartiste una noche de amor y quiero saber qué sentiste esta noche en mi casa, porque siempre te voy a visitar yo. Contame”, le dijo el actor a Mirtha mirándola a los ojos.\nClaramente sensibilizada por el momento, la Chiqui tomó el micrófono y miró fijamente al actor. “Yo no puedo decir con palabras lo que sentí. Estoy tan emocionada. Realmente este jovencito es un genio. Un genio absoluto. Nos hace pensar. Nos hace reaccionar. Nos hace querer a nuestro vecino. Mira esto. Es extraordinario. Lo que hacés es extraordinario. No sé cómo se llama esto, pero lo que hacés es maravilloso”, le expresó la diva con la voz quebrada. Ante las palabras de ella, Bossi solo le llegó a exclamar: “Te amo”.\n[Te puede interesar: La agenda de Mirtha Legrand en Mar del Plata: descanso, salidas nocturnas y una ovación muy especial](/teleshow/2024/01/04/la-agenda-de-mirtha-legrand-en-mar-del-plata-descanso-salidas-nocturnas-y-una-ovacion-muy-especial/)\nAsí, luego de regalar obsequios tan llamativos como flores de plástico y hasta churros de una reconocida marca a manera de souvenir, Martín Bossi públicamente le propuso casamiento a Mirtha Legrand. Al ritmo de la marcha nupcial ambos salieron del teatro tomados de la mano por la fila central de plateas ante la ovación de todo el público.\nLuego del espectáculo, Mirtha Legrand fue invitada por Carlos Rottemberg a una comida íntima en un exclusivo restaurante cinco estrellas de la ciudad balnearia junto a Martín Bossi y los amigos íntimos de la diva.\nActualmente, la figura del espectáculo está alojada en la suite diplomática del Costa Galana.

En tan solo unos días, la Chiqui dejará La Feliz ya que el 20 de enero está pautado su regreso a la televisión, según lo confirmó su nieto Nacho Viale, productor del ciclo, y corroboró la propia Mirtha: “Van a estar Adrián Suar y Guido Kaczka”, señaló.\nDe esta manera, el descanso televisivo de Mirtha será de solo 20 días, ya que su última mesaza fue a finales de diciembre de 2023. Con las energías renovadas, la mediática iniciará la temporada 56 de sus históricos programas.\nDe todas maneras, a finales de enero la diva volverá a La Feliz.

The government has also announced a holiday for Jummat-ul-Vida, the last Friday of Ramzan.
