    "title": "Division of Labor: Controversial Teachers' Union Funded Labor Secretary’s Speech, Then the Doors Opened",
    "text": "The American Federation of Teachers funded a speech that acting labor secretary Julie Su delivered to a labor group last December. Over the following months, Su hobnobbed with American Federation of Teachers officials at conferences in Las Vegas and Alabama and hosted its controversial union chief Randi Weingarten at an event to hammer out policies favorable to the labor organization. The American Federation of Teachers, which advocated for school lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, paid $3,500 in \"honorary expenses\" to subsidize Su’s speech at the National Council for Occupational Safety & Health’s annual meeting on Dec. 6, 2023, according to lobbying disclosures . Su bragged in her speech about the Labor Department’s \"record number\" of workplace safety citations and pledged to \"unleash our full power to protect working people.\" While the union’s funding for executive branch events is legal, it could raise conflict of interest concerns for Su, who faced scrutiny earlier this year over meetings with union leaders weeks before the Department of Labor enacted union-backed regulations regarding independent contractors, the Washington Free Beacon reported . Republicans have opposed Su over her mismanagement of the California unemployment system when she served as the state’s labor secretary. Though Su has not received enough Senate support to confirm her to a permanent post, President Joe Biden reappointed her to the \"acting secretary\" role last year. On Jan. 10, Su joined American Federation of Teachers officials at the AFL-CIO Tech Summit in Las Vegas to discuss \"bargaining essential protections into our union contracts\" and other labor issues, according to social media posts of the event. Su met two days later with union executive vice president Evelyn DeJesus, this time at a union conference in Alabama, where Su \"reafirm[ed] her commitment with Latino and Immigrant workers,\" according to social media https://www.facebook.com/EvelynDeJesusVP/posts/883086367152945?locale=bs_BA and Su’s work calendars . On March 6, Su appointed American Federation of Teachers vice president Jan Hochadel to serve on the Department of Labor’s apprenticeship advisory commission. The following month, the American Federation of Teachers hosted a conference for Su, members of Congress, and a group of domestic health care workers. On April 23, Su convened a White House meeting that included Weingarten, the teachers' union president, to hammer out an initiative to pressure private equity firms to invest in union-friendly companies. The Wall Street Journal editorial board said the meeting presented a conflict of interest for Su and noted that Weingarten has long supported a \"push for government worker pension funds to boycott private-equity and hedge-fund managers who donate to charter schools.\" The American Federation of Teachers paid expenses to several other organizations to host federal officials and members of Congress, according to the organization’s lobbying disclosures. The union paid $5,000 in \"honorary expenses\" for appearances by Reps. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) and Jonathan Jackson (D., Ill.) at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition’s annual convention last year. It gave $30,000 and $62,400 to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, respectively, for galas that featured President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, several Cabinet officials, and members of Congress. The Department of Labor and American Federation of Teachers did not respond to requests for comment. Published under: Department of Labor , Ilhan Omar , Randi Weingarten , Teachers Unions , Unions",

    "text": "来源：市场资讯\n（来源：量子位）\nAI生成论文泛滥成灾，arXiv平台看不下去了——\n紧急升级审核机制，用自动化工具来检测AI生成内容。\nNature最新发现，原来每年竟然都有2%的论文会因为AI使用被拒？！\n比如像，bioRxiv和medRxiv每天都要拒绝十多篇公式化AI手稿，每个月就高达7000多份。\n本来是方便快速分享成果的预印本平台，现已成为了AI内容的温床。\n一方面AI写作泛滥成灾，另一方面又要确保不会误伤到合理的AI英语润色需求。\n两难之间，预印本平台也是出手整顿了…….\n不过这件事还得从一篇离谱的预印本论文说起。\n这篇论文题目名为“自我实验报告：梦境中生成式人工智能界面的出现”，7月发表在PsyArXiv上。\n乍一看好像没什么问题，直到“不幸”被一名心理学家点开了文档。\n嚯好家伙，整篇论文只有短短几页，署名还只有作者Jiazheng Liu一个人，也没有注明隶属机构。\n再仔细看看内容呢，所描述的AI实验更是脱离实际，基本可以盖棺定论用了AI。\n由于没有明确声明AI的使用情况，PsyArxiv也是立即下架删除了这篇论文。\n结果没过多久，由于预印本审核不严，该作者再次在PsyArxiv上传了标题和摘要几乎一模一样的预印本。\n另外作者还向Nature附了一封邮件，邮件内容表示AI在该论文生成中发挥作用有限，只用于数学推导、符号计算、组装和应用现有数学工具、公式验证以及另外八项任务。\n他称自己是常驻中国的独立研究人员，没有高等教育学位，唯一的工具还是台二手智能手机……当然，现在第二个版本也已被删除。\n不过这也只是众多AI生成论文中的其中一篇，据arXiv估计，每年都有约2%的论文，因为涉及AI和专门批量造假学术论文的论文工厂，而被平台拒之门外。\n尤其是在ChatGPT推出后，这一比例还出现了大幅度增长的情况，LLM生成了arXiv上22%的计算机科学摘要以及约10%的bioRxiv生物学摘要。\n在一些发表在生物医学期刊的摘要中，AI生成也达到了14%。\nPsyArXiv也对此发表了声明，明确表示涉及AI生成的论文内容有所增加，对于他们这类降低研究共享门槛的非盈利组织而言，越来越多诸如此类的内容，只会让读者削弱对平台共享内容的信任程度。\n筛选低质量的内容需要资源支持，且会降低论文提交后的处理速度，这与预印本平台致力于让科学家们更容易发表工作的初心相悖。\n而与此同时，AI幻觉导致的虚假预印本也会带来错误信息，误导从事相关工作的科研人员。\n如何能够在保持快速审核的同时，确保质量水平，现已成为预印本平台共同的挑战。\n要知道，AI论文生成并不能全盘否定，许多研究人员会使用AI工具来提高清晰度或者总结数据，尤其是对于一些英语非母语的作者，他们需要AI协助完成润色工作。\n这是相当合理的行为，并不存在论文欺诈，真正值得担心的是那些完全由AI捏造方法、结果的论文内容。\n但二者之间其实相当难以区分，一些预印本平台，如PsyArXiv，会直接撤下被标记为内容存疑的论文，但还有一些平台考虑到可能会误伤，所以虽然也会将内容标记为“已撤回”，但在没有明确法律要求的情况下，不会直接进行删除。\n不过他们也没有坐以待毙，现在会使用各种自动化工具和人工筛选程序来捕捉此类可疑内容，如Research Square正在使用一款名为Geppetto的工具来检测人工智能生成文本的痕迹。\narXiv也在试图提高综述性论文的发表标准，因为这类论文往往投稿数量巨大，且很多都是AI生成，这样做的目的就是为了丰富个人履历。\n一直依赖人工筛选的openRxiv，现在也在寻求自动化工具使用，以进一步识别AI生成内容的特征。\n当前预印本平台们都正在加急采取一系列反制措施，包括检查异常用户行为、在投稿流程中增设步骤、调整内容公开可见的方式或时间，以阻止低质量内容进入平台。\n但这无异于隔靴搔痒，预印本平台在反击的同时，AI也在不断发展。\n更有甚者，一些作者为了规避被自动化工具抓住AI使用痕迹，会在论文里加入提示词，试图欺骗自动评审。\n也有专业的编辑表示，这对于预印本平台来说相当可怕，因为预印本其实本质还是未经人工审查的。\n所以当未来AI发展到，虚假与真实内容之间已经完全无法区分的时候，预印本平台又将如何应对呢？\n[1]https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02469-y\n[2]https://www.cos.io/blog/evaluating-ai-impact-on-open-research-infrastructure",

    "text": "Liverpool will be battered by torrential rain this weekend ahead of New Year's Eve. The Met Office issued a yellow [weather](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/weather) warning for Merseyside earlier this week as [Storm Gerrit](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/what-supercell-thunderstorm-localised-tornado-28356546) swept across the country. While the \"challenging conditions\" brought by the storm have now eased, the region can still expect to see wet and windy weather in the coming days, according to the Met Office. The weather agency said: \"The last few days of 2023 are forecast to be unsettled, with strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. An area of low pressure which pushes in from the west on Saturday will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year.\" READ MORE: [Man went 'out of his mind' after devastating phone call from his brother](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-went-out-mind-after-28357314) READ MORE: [Boxer 'wins most important fight' after being stabbed in chest](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/boxer-wins-most-important-fight-28361081) The latest forecast for Liverpool shows heavy rain to start the day on Saturday, before this changes to overcast by late morning. Winds of up to 35mph are forecast by lunchtime, with the rain returning into the afternoon on Saturday. However, temperatures are expected to remain mild for this time of year, averaging at around 10 degrees. The Met Office said a \"deep area of low pressure\" will move across the country on Saturday. The boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east could lead to snow across higher ground in the north of England and Scotland. Met Office chief forecaster, Steven Ramsdale, said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Looking further ahead into 2024, there is low forecast confidence. Nick Silkstone is a Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster. He said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.” [Don't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the Echo Daily newsletter here](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?view=Solus&mailingListId=5ec7f1cc-052c-409a-a8f2-739597fa11c9&utm_source=solusarticle)",

    "text": "By Capt. Christopher Kim,\n311th Signal Command (Theater)\nTustin, CA: Perseverance is one of the greatest attributes of any Solder in the United States Army and this rings especially true for Lt. Col. Phidel Hun, G3 Plans Officer in the 311th Signal Command Support Unit, who looks back at his journey from escaping Cambodian genocide to where he is today.\nBorn into the Khmer Rouge Regime, which led to the death of 1.5 to 3 million citizens, Lt. Col. Phidel Hun had to fend for himself to survive ever since he could remember.\n“During the Pol Pot regime, my parents were executed when I was 6 months old because of their educated and scholarly background,” said Hun. “I can recall swimming through a rice field in the middle of the night without shoes to escape and even though I stepped on bamboo thorns, I could not cry or yell because I would be left behind or be discovered and killed by the soldiers.”\nAs Hun was able to escape Cambodia during the genocide, he would spend time in an orphanage in the border of Thailand and Cambodia to survive to see another day.\n“I remember being so hungry I would eat anything and that is when I had to learn to trap and hunt for food,” Hun recalls. “Since I had burnt hands from a childhood accident, kids in the orphanage teased me calling me a cripple and was bullied growing up.”\nIn the midst of living this difficult and challenging life, a glimpse of hope appeared as his grandmother who was in America made a valiant effort to save him and bring him to the United States. She specifically identified him as the boy with the burnt hands which was from a traumatic childhood accident.\n“My family in Cambodia was wealthy and when they saw the beginnings of the communist regime, they escaped to Vietnam and then to the US,” said Lt. Col. Hun. “My grandmother came to the US in the mid 70s before Cambodia fell to communism and she made a rescue attempt to save me by identifying me as a boy with burnt hands.”\nThe horrific childhood accident that left Hun’s hand in critical condition was the sole way of identification and through that tragic incident, he was able to be rescued and escorted.\n“After she saw me, she took my story to Senator Alan Cranston and Senator Diane Feinstein and they pushed it to Congress and they passed a law enabling me to come to the US on a Humanitarian Assistance effort and then my grandmother became my sponsor.”\nAs Lt. Col. Hun would be relocated to Bellflower in Southern California, assimilating to a new culture and new life was challenging. Through the resilience that he has exemplified time after time, he ended up earning his Bachelor of Arts degree from Cal State University, Fullerton after 10 years of hard work. It was also during this time he received his commission to be an Officer in the United States Army.\n“It took 10 years to graduate from college and ROTC and received my commission at 2004 and I pursued my passion to be an Army Officer,” said Hun. “I always had this fascination ever since I was younger to be a knight to defend the weak.”\nEven after 20 years of honorable service, which includes deployments overseas, in the US Army, Lt. Col. Hun’s passion to serve this great nation has not diminished but only grew stronger.\n“The Army saved my life and the more I served, my appreciation for the nation and military grew more,” said Lt. Col. Hun. “They took a broken boy and and gave him the opportunity to what he is now and I am still incredibly grateful for the Army because it saved my life. I have been serving for over 20 years and I still love it.”\nDespite the life of challenges and turmoil, Lt. Col. Hun refuses to allow his past to haunt him but uses it as fuel to help others. He uses his traumatic childhood and upbringing as a tool to recalibrate his perspective on a daily basis.\n“In the past, what motivated me to live another day was vengeance and hatred, but the vengeance I want to take is to rebuild,” said Hun. “I want to help others become educated and build opportunities because this is the reason why my parents were executed.”\nLt. Col. Hun’s “American Dream” is not materialistic or the proverbial house with a white picket fence but it is fulfilling the potential of what this great nation offers. Instead of making a built in excuse blaming his troubled upbringing, he takes advantage of everything that life offers.\n“In Cambodia I suffered through genocides, hunger, and hatred and the US gave me the opportunity to what I want to be,” Lt. Col. Hun said. “Our country is the best country on the face of the earth because it gives us the freedom to pursue opportunities. The American Dream is being able to help others help achieve greatness and being a great person and in order to do that you need to help yourself.” Growing up with no family and constantly hungry, hope was seldom for Hun and he would have never imagined the amazing life he has now. As a proud husband of 18 years and a father of four sons, he attributes his success to his grit and willingness to live a life of substance.\n“We all have been through suffering but I won’t let my past determine my future because I am constantly seeking happiness for my family and myself,” said Hun. “Its not about our past and where we come from but it’s about how we play the hand that we’re dealt.”\nAfter decades of reflection of why he had to endure such a traumatic and horrific childhood, Hun uses this experience to showcase the will of the human spirit and how tragedy can be transformed into triumph.\n“Im lucky to be able to survive the genocide and I have the freedom to be somebody,” said Lt. Col. Hun. “Don’t give up and persevere. If one door closes, another opportunity will open up. If you need help, always reach out because there are good hearted people who are willing to help you.”\n|Date Taken:\n|01.15.2024\n|Date Posted:\n|01.20.2024 18:02\n|Story ID:\n|462142\n|Location:\n|TUSTIN, CA, US\n|Hometown:\n|TUSTIN, CA, US\n|Web Views:\n|3\n|Downloads:\n|0\nThis work, From genocide refugee to Army officer, by\nCPT Christopher kim, identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.",

    "title": "2024-2030, nos six scénarios noirs de l'eau : comment anticiper le pire ? – L'Express",
    "text": "Entre une région touchée par des inondations et une autre frappée d’une sécheresse historique , il n’y a que mille kilomètres. Paradoxal et saisissant effet d’un climat toujours plus bouleversé, et de tensions grandissantes sur les ressources en eau du pays . Chaque été, désormais, impose son débat sur ses usages et sur son accès, alors que les pluies parfois torrentielles de l’hiver ravagent certains territoires. Comment adapter la France à cette nouvelle réalité ? L’Express a souhaité apporter sa pierre à l’édifice d’un débat plus nécessaire que jamais. Ces six \"scénarios noirs\" de l’eau à l’horizon 2030 en sont la traduction. Ils ne sont ni des prévisions, ni des prédictions. Mais des hypothèses sur lesquelles travaillent déjà plus ou moins directement les pouvoirs publics et industriels, et dont les trames ont été affinées et enrichies par la quarantaine d’experts interrogés : chercheurs, météorologues, hauts fonctionnaires, ingénieurs, assureurs… Tous sont unanimes : la résilience du pays face à ces événements se construit dès maintenant.\nPublicité EPISODE 1 - Mars 2026, la crue centennale de la Seine ravage Paris : nos scénarios noirs de l'eau\nEPISODE 2 - Août 2027, un méga-feu dans l'Hérault : l’inquiétante hypothèse d’un \"suremballement\"\nEPISODE 3 - Janvier 2026 : un dangereux cocktail météo frappe sauvagement le nord de la France\nEPISODE 4 - Août 2029 : plusieurs étés brûlants attisent les tensions sur le Rhône\nEPISODE 5 - Décembre 2025 : une tempête tropicale et un cyclone frappent La Réunion\nEPISODE 6 - Juillet 2028 : dans les Alpes, le glacier de Tête Rousse s’effondre\nLe contraste est saisissant. D’un côté, des Pyrénées-Orientales assoiffées , subissant une sécheresse historique . Entre avril 2023 et mars 2024, le déficit cumulé de précipitations dans l’est du département - où réside la majorité de la population - a dépassé de 60 % les normales. De l’autre, des inondations successives . Depuis novembre 2023, plus de 230 communes du Pas-de-Calais et du Nord sont touchées par des pluies diluviennes. Des vagues de chaleur accompagnées de trombes d’eau : ce constat contre-intuitif a notamment été relevé le 22 avril dans un rapport publié conjointement par l’observatoire européen Copernicus et par l’Organisation météorologique mondiale. Si l’hiver météorologique 2023-2024 a été le \"deuxième le plus chaud enregistré\", il a été accompagné de précipitations en hausse de 7 %. Au point de faire de 2023 l’une \"des quatre années les plus pluvieuses en Europe depuis 1950\".\nLIRE AUSSI : Eau potable : la France pourra-t-elle faire face à la fin de l'abondance ? Face à ces événements d’ampleur et de récurrence quasi inédites, la question de l’adaptation au changement climatique se pose. Celle de la projection des sinistres à venir, aussi. Car les conséquences d’une crue, d’un épisode de sécheresse intense ou d’un cyclone ne sont pas circonscrites à l’instant T où ces événements se produisent : les dégâts coûtent - cher - et durent - longtemps. D’après l’association professionnelle France Assureurs, les catastrophes naturelles ont coûté 6,5 milliards d’euros aux assureurs français en 2023 . Soit la troisième année la plus onéreuse, derrière 1999 (13,8 milliards d’euros) et 2022 (10 milliards d’euros). \"Il faut prendre en compte les potentiels effets dominos : celui des coûts, les problèmes entourant la remise à niveau des infrastructures critiques, comme les réseaux électriques, sans compter les problèmes sociétaux, à l’instar des éventuels déplacements de populations\", énumère Anne Johannet, coordinatrice du Centre de recherche et d’enseignement en environnement et en risques de l’IMT Mines Alès. Pour tenter de lever ces incertitudes, les analyses visant à cadrer l’impact du changement climatique d’ici à 2050 se sont multipliées. Plus rares sont celles qui portent sur le court terme - en l’occurrence, les six prochaines années.\nUne quarantaine d’experts L’Express s’est donc livré à cet exercice. Une quarantaine d’experts - chercheurs, météorologues, hauts fonctionnaires, ingénieurs, assureurs… - présentent dans ce dossier leurs analyses des principales menaces et tensions qui guettent la France d’ici à 2030. Ces six scénarios ne sont ni des prévisions, ni des prédictions. Leur trame a été élaborée à la fois en consultant des études de projection et des plans de protection des risques disponibles en source ouverte, et en sollicitant les gestionnaires des principaux réseaux d’eau et d’électricité du pays.\nLIRE AUSSI : Crise de l'eau : \"Il faut un véritable plan Marshall en France\" La majorité de ces hypothèses recoupent celles sur lesquelles travaillent les industriels et les pouvoirs publics. Elles sont directement reliées aux conséquences déjà visibles du changement climatique, comme les scénarios explorant les conséquences d’une sécheresse prolongée dans la vallée du Rhône , ou d’un manque d’eau rendant difficile l’extinction d’incendies dans l’Hérault. Certains, comme celui de la crue centennale de la Seine, ont été explorés car ils sont depuis longtemps étudiés par les services de l’Etat et les entreprises.\n\"Nous nous y préparons, et cette préparation ne date pas d’hier, insiste Emmanuel Lenain, directeur sûreté globale chez Suez France. Des investissements ont été réalisés pour protéger les équipements stratégiques. Mais cela ne veut pas dire que tout est facile.\" De fait, il y a eu quelques ratés : en 2022, un rapport de la Cour des comptes soulignait la \"prévention insuffisante du risque d’inondation en Ile-de-France.\" Toutes les régions de l’Hexagone tentent d’améliorer leur gestion de crise. La tâche est toutefois ardue. Dans une France toujours plus bouleversée par le changement climatique , se préparer à la juste mesure requiert un grand travail de prospective. L’Express a souhaité ajouter sa pierre à l’édifice.\n.

    "text": "24/10/2024 - 18:13\nRIO DE JANEIRO, 24 OUT (ANSA) – O mundo empresarial do Rio de Janeiro, segundo motor da economia brasileira, está de olho na legislação sobre novos residentes que prevê uma “flat tax”, a redução das alíquotas do imposto de renda, de 200 mil euros para rendimentos e bens produzidos fora da Itália.\nUma oportunidade para o fisco italiano captar novas entradas consistentes do Brasil, onde existe uma grande e economicamente sólida comunidade de ítalo-descendentes, mas também uma força motriz para investimentos estratégicos na Itália.\nMais de 50 empreendedores e advogados empresariais, com uma plateia lotada, participaram da iniciativa “Invest in Italy” https://www.investinitaly.gov.it sobre o regime especial, organizado pela Câmara Ítalo-Brasileira de Comércio e Indústria da cidade carioca, com apoio do Consulado Geral no Rio de Janeiro, e Ice/Ita.\nO encontro foi uma oportunidade para esclarecer dúvidas sobre a regulamentação tributária, mas também sobre a obtenção de vistos, a começar pelo dos investidores, um estatuto de dois anos para cidadãos não comunitários da UE que trabalham em ativos estratégicos na Itália.\n“A Itália apresenta um quadro político-institucional muito estável em comparação com muitos outros países da União Europeia e a estabilidade político-institucional e macroeconômica de um país é um dos principais fatores na escolha dos investidores estrangeiros”, destacou o cônsul geral da Itália no Rio de Janeiro, Massimiliano Iacchini, ao apresentar o evento.\n“O governo italiano oferece aos investidores estrangeiros uma estrutura completa de apoio, baseada nas agências parceiras do Ice – Italian Trade Agency (Ita) e Invitalia”, recordou Diego Ortiz, da Ice, enquanto a presidente da Câmara de Comércio, Renata Novotny, destacou como o evento “forneceu informações técnicas sobre o regime tributário, esclarecendo suas vantagens”.
