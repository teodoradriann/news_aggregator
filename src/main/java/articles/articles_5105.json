    "text": "Next Article\nBhopal principal files complaint over Azaan sound disturbing students\nWhat's the story\nPushpalata Chouksey, the principal of Bhopal's Hamidia College, has filed a complaint with the government over the sound of Azaan from an adjacent mosque.\nShe alleges that the mosque is built on land intended for the college's science department and its loudspeaker disrupts classes and examinations.\nChouksey has demanded a land demarcation, claiming the mosque occupies space meant for the college's science building, India Today reported.\nPolitical fallout\nClarification on construction site sought\nChouksey has also urged authorities to clarify the construction site of the science block. The Bhopal Collector has reportedly taken note of her complaint and asked relevant officials to investigate. However, Imam Hafiz Mohammad Farooq of the mosque has denied these allegations, claiming that their place of worship is almost 300 years old and built on Waqf land.\nNoise control\nControversy turns political\nFarooq also accused the college of targeting the mosque while ignoring similar noise from a nearby temple.\nHe added that they voluntarily reduce the volume during examinations.\nThe controversy has now turned political, with BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma supporting Chouksey and citing Supreme Court guidelines on noise pollution.\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court held that, while religious practices are fundamental, the use of loudspeakers for religious activities must comply with noise rules to ensure public peace, health, and privacy.\nPolitical accusations\nCongress MLA's response\n\"No one can claim a fundamental right to create noise by amplifying the sound of his speech with the help of loudspeakers,\" the apex court had ruled. The Congress party has also weighed in on the matter, with Congress MLA Arif Masood accusing Chouksey of politicizing the issue. He said that the mosque committee is already cooperating by controlling volume when necessary.",

    "text": "[Ten photos from across China: Dec 22 - 28](/a/202312/29/WS658df937a31040ac301aa03b.html) Italy bears severest weather on record in 2023: reports Xinhua | Updated: 2023-12-29 09:21 ROME -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday. According to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths. On the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula. In its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat. Legambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia. Among the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said. Much of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy. Meanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side.",

Además de alejar a los demonios y a los malos espíritus, protege a las personas contra los peligros físicos, así como ayuda a superar los retos de la vida y a fortalecer la fe y la voluntad. E incluso las personas le rezan a San Miguel Arcángel cuando tienen miedo de alguna cosa, se sienten solos, tristes, ansiosos o que necesitan algún tipo de ayuda o acompañamiento espiritual.",

    "title": "Pope Francis urges young adults at Taizé event to ‘dare to build a different world’",
    "text": "CNA Staff, Dec 29, 2023 / 16:00 pm (CNA).\nPope Francis urged young people attending the 46th European Meeting organized by the ecumenical monastic community Taizé to “dare to build a different world, a world of listening, dialogue, and openness.”\nThe European Meeting is an annual ecumenical Christian event that hosts several thousand young adults from across the world to gather and pray in a host city. This year the event is taking place in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, from Dec. 28 to Jan. 1.\nTaizé is an ecumenical monastic community founded in a small town in the Burgundy territory of France in 1940. Its focus is promoting faith and Christian unity among young people, many of whom participate in the community through retreats and other events.\nThe group is also known for its distinctive chants, many of which have come to be used and recognized well beyond the community.\nThe theme this year is “Journeying Together” and will feature personal reflection, singing, silence, and prayer.\nYoung adults from England, Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and several other nations participating in the event will stay with host families.\nIn a letter to the attendees on behalf of Pope Francis, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said the Holy Father “expresses his closeness” to all.\n“The recent World Youth Days have enabled you to live, as Church and as community, the beautiful experience of friendship with God and with others,” he said.\n“You are the today of God, the today of the Church! The Church needs you in order to be fully herself. As Church, you are the body of the risen Lord present in the world,” he said.\nThe message said that “we live in a world full of noise” that has “stifled” the value of “silence and listening.” Parolin invited the young people to “rediscover the deeper dimension of listening.”\n“Listening is an act of love. It is at the heart of trust. Without listening, little can grow or develop,” the message said.\nParolin said that often the impression is given that “those who shout the loudest are worthy of being heard.”\nHe said we live in a “difficult time” with conflicts and war “because no one listens anymore,” which has contributed to the increase in violence that we see today.\n“I urge you to dare to build a different world, a world of listening, dialogue, and openness, to ‘point to ideals other than those of this world, testifying to the beauty of generosity, service, purity, perseverance, forgiveness, fidelity to our personal vocation, prayer, the pursuit of justice and the common good, love for the poor, and social friendship,’” Parolin said, citing Pope Francis’ 2019 apostolic exhortation Christus Vivit.\nParolin said: “One of the challenges you must face is that of walking together in order to work for the qualitative transformation of life in our societies.” He said that to walk together means “barring the way to marginalization, isolation, exclusion, and the rejection of a category of people.”\nHe exhorted the young people to commit themselves to live like Jesus, who didn’t exclude anyone.\nParolin noted that sometimes people can feel “homeless.”\n“When we face these challenges together, there can be experiences of beauty, of transcendence, which help us to discover the spark that makes us start again with new vitality,” he said.\n“Dear young people, the Holy Father is counting on you and he trusts you, the Church trusts you. Through your words and actions, send a powerful message to our world, which rejects the vulnerable,” he said.\nHe called on the young people to live in the present and to not “sacrifice your precious youth on the altar of superficial pleasures.”\n“Don’t let yourselves be robbed of your dreams, and help to ‘build a society worthy of the name,’” he said, citing Fratelli Tutti, Pope Francis’ 2020 encyclical.\n“Entrusting each of you and your families to the Lord, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, Pope Francis grants you his apostolic blessing with all his heart. He asks you to pray for him,” he concluded.\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides,\nplease consider donating to support our efforts.

The stolen 342,000 Ether (ETH), worth around $147 per coin at the time, has soared in value and is now estimated to be worth over $1 billion due to recent market surges.\nThe [investigation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/upbit-hack-lazarus-south-korea-police), conducted by South Korea’s National Office of Investigation, tracked crypto flows, IP addresses, and linguistic patterns, with support from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, to pinpoint [North Korea](https://dig.watch/updates/north-koreas-cyberattacks-on-cryptocurrency-platforms-continues-to-soar)’s involvement. It is the first time South Korea has directly tied a cryptocurrency attack to the reclusive nation, a significant breakthrough in cybercrime investigations.\nMeanwhile, the probe into Upbit continues after allegations of weak Know Your Customer measures. Regulators flagged over 600,000 potential violations, including acceptance of unclear identification documents, which could lead to hefty fines and regulatory challenges for the exchange.",
