    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) arrives for a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol on September 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. On Thursday Greene posted about Christian women dressing more “modest” as not to tempt Christian men. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene said Christian women should be dressing “nice and feminine” in efforts to avoid tempting Christian men.\nGreene, a Georgia Republican who is a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has long faced backlash from both Democrats and Republicans over comments about Christianity. She was assailed for selling “Proud Christian Nationalist” T-shirts and saying during a 2022 Turning Point USA event that Christians should “live our lives and vote like we are nationalists.”\nIn a social media post Thursday, Greene criticized conservative Christian women she believes are “selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world’s sexualization of women,” noting that her statement may be an unpopular opinion.\n“If you are conservative and a Christian you know you don’t have to express yourself in sexual ways and you know you are attractive by dressing nice and feminine, and you can be beautiful and modest at the same time,” Greene wrote to X, formerly Twitter.\nShe continued: “Men will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification. It’s also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble.”\nGreene concluded the post by calling on Christian women to be an “example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world.”\n“Be the light, don’t fall into the darkness,” she wrote.\nNewsweek reached out to Greene’s press office via email on Thursday for additional comment.\nHer post drew mixed reactions on social media, with some arguing Greene does not represent all of Christianity and should not be telling other women what they should be wearing.\n“You do NOT hold Christian values!!” posted X user @suzannebeme1.\n“Teeing up for The Handmaid’s Tale,” posted @adhd_beans.\n“Rich coming from @mtgreene but why is it a girl’s/woman’s responsibility to dress/act so as not to tempt ‘their Christian brothers & cause them to stumble.’ WHAT??? Isn’t that a lot of power being given to the weaker sex??? And tempting their brothers is a whole other issue,” posted @LauraTripp57.\n“This sounds like the exact speech they give to women in cults,” posted @ZPoet.\nOthers, however, voiced agreement with the Republican representative’s post.\n“Marge is right that men will respect women more if they respect themselves. Same goes with women respecting men. Ultimately it’s the brain that’s the most attractive element of any human. At least in the long run,” posted X user Paul A. Szypula.\n“They are. The culture in this nation must change,” posted X user Ryan Wasielewski.\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial",

    "text": "Amid the intensifying Russia-Ukraine war, a recent report claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s outreach to Vladimir Putin averted a \"potential nuclear attack\" on Ukraine in 2022. The CNN report, citing two senior officials, said that the United States had been preparing rigorously for a potential nuclear strike by Russia on Ukraine. PM Modi and other countries played an important role in averting the crisis, stated the report.\nThe officials said that the Biden administration was concerned whether Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon against its war with Ukraine.\nAmid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, said the report.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping&apos;s intervention was also mentioned in the report along with Modi in averting the crisis.\n\"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, and encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" the senior administration official told CNN.\n\"I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be. I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,\" the officer said.\nRather than directly criticising Russia, PM Modi had told Putin that this is not the era of war.\nThe CNN report also said that Russia circulated a \"false flag story\" about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which the US feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack.\n\"We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,\" a senior administration official said.\n\"And at no point did we ever see any indications of the types of steps that we would&apos;ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons,\" he added.\n(With ANI inputs)",

While we respect all our neighbors, their rights and their territorial integrity and help to preserve it, but we do not accept any threats against us from the countries that are neighboring to us,” Ashtiyani said in remarks to ILNA. “First, we are trying to prevent something from happening by negotiating, talking and interacting with these countries, but if they cannot control it and there is a delay, then we have to react and we will take action ourselves and it doesn't matter which country it is,” he said, commenting on Iran’s recent strike against terrorist sides in Pakistan. He noted, “This right of legitimate defense exists for us, and based on all international laws and international standards, any country attacked by terrorists can legitimately defend itself, and wherever we are threatened from any area, we can react.”",

Disney World Vacations in Jeopardy as Disease Spreads Across Florida\nDisney fans are expecting dozens of significant announcements about the future of The Walt Disney Company and expansion projects at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort.\nHowever, this year’s D23 Expo may come with a surprise. Los Angeles County and Southern California health officials warn that an unprecedented spread could overwhelm the Disney event.\nOver the past two weeks, LA County officials have found a dramatic increase in COVID-19 in the wastewater in Southern California. California is now considered at “very high” risk, one of only four states in America with that designation, including Florida.\nCredit: Inside The Magic Related: If D’Amaro/Iger Don’t Bring it At D23, It Could Be Disney’s Last Stand\nDr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told the Los Angeles Times:\nIt does seem like we are spitting out more and more variants a lot more quickly, and that’s probably to be expected. This virus is still very, very new to humans, and the virus wants to live, and the way that it lives is by evading immunity. If you have cough-and-cold symptoms, at this point, living in Los Angeles, you should really think that they are COVID until proven otherwise.\nHowever, health officials are not the only ones warning D23 guests about the uptick in Southern California’s “Flirt” variant. Visitors who arrived at the event early to spend time at the Disneyland Resort also warned their fellow attendees that COVID-19 is different this time.\nOne wrote on social media:\nD23 PSA (since it’s smushy with tons of ppl): If you have nausea or have food poisoning, take a Covid test. When getting meds for what started with tummy trouble, a pharmacist gave me a Covid test and I was positive. (I’ll be fine) It’s very different symptoms for me vs 2022.\nD23 PSA (since it’s smushy with tons of ppl):\nIf you have nausea or have food poisoning, take a Covid test.\nWhen getting meds for what started with tummy trouble, a pharmacist gave me a Covid test and I was positive.

    "text": "Brother and sister duo Aaron and Kayla LeCaire have acquired Colville Motor Sports, and changed it to Pro Plus Powersports.\n“We started having conversations about it with (previous owner) Steve Fogle in January,” said Aaron LeCaire. “Steve wanted to retire from the business.”\n“It’s funny, because we’ve known Steve pretty much all our lives,” said Kayla LeCaire. “Our mom used to babysit Steve’s nephews while she was detailing cars. Steve contacted us when he was ready to retire, and it was a really smooth transition. He still pops in here. He’s retired, but he’s still tying up loose ends.”\n“It was hard at first, since our office used to be Steve’s office since we were kids,” Aaron added.\nThe LeCaire siblings are familiar with the power sports business, and have two other locations, previously operated under the name Protection Plus: one in Deer Park, and the other on Spanish Prairie Rd. in Colville.\n“Our mother, Cathy LeCaire, started the business at Spanish Prairie in 1989,” said Aaron. “She began with auto detailing and the business grew. Mom passed away in 2021.”\n“We try to carry on the legacy and name, since none of this would exist without her. So, it was already a family affair when we decided to start the Deer Park location,” added Kayla.\nAaron spent time away from the family business while he served in the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret. He moved back home in 2019. “I was happy to be a part of the business again,” he said. “Kayla’s the boss, though!”\nWhile the power sports business is under a new name, it will continue to sell dirt bikes, ATVs, snowmobiles, and side-by-sides, as well as the accompanying equipment. Pro Plus Powersports also provides parts and service.\n“No matter how old the machine is, we will do our best to help with service and parts, because not everyone has the financial means to just buy a new machine,” said Aaron.\nAaron and Kayla said they grew up riding dirt bikes, snowmobiles, and side-by-sides. “So, we know how people use this stuff and how hard they use and abuse the equipment,” Aaron said.\nAaron and Kayla said they try to have a more familiar approach with their customers. “We are personable, not like auto dealerships,” said Kayla. “Some of the bigger companies are like pressure cookers. We’re here to serve the community. Also, as a woman, I try to make things less intimidating. Some side-by-sides can cost upwards of $50,000, which is a big investment. We like to educate customers about what they’re getting into.”\nKayla is the general manager of all three locations. The LeCaire siblings have retained all of the original staff from when Steve Fogle owned Colville Motor Sports. “We have great people, and I’ve learned a lot from our technician in Deer Park,” said Aaron.\n“We both live in Deer Park and flex our time between the locations,” Kayla said. “We go where we are needed. Aaron and I work very hard. Why would it be fair to ask anyone to work hard when I’m not willing to also? I am very passionate about this.” Kayla said she focuses primarily on operations, while Aaron focuses on service, parts, techs, and mechanics.\n“Kayla has built this business. She had a goal, a vision, and she would not be deterred,” said Aaron.\nAaron and Kayla LeCaire have some changes they’d like to make; for example, they plan on improving the signage, painting the premises, and adding some fencing. They have some layout changes in mind to accommodate larger equipment that they’d like to carry.\n“Eventually, way down the road, we’d like to combine both of the Colville stores in a single location,” said Aaron. “But that is in the future. Mom was smart, because she lived within her means.\n“We think it’s important to invest in our town,” continued Aaron. “We grew up snowmobiling. We help people in need. We give people a chance to ride who would never have the chance. Here at Pro Plus Powersports, we legitimately care.”\nPro Plus Powersports is located at 165 W. Birch Ave. in Colville.",

    "text": "The German Bishops' Conference has backed down after receiving an ultimatum from Rome. Three influential cardinals of the Roman Curia sent a letter to the bishops asking them to stop voting on the statutes of their synodal committee. The Germans issued a statement saying they have accepted the warning. As the General Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference, we take the letter from Rome very seriously and this is very important to make clear. Therefore, we have not voted on a statute for the Synodal Commission. This commission was instituted in November 2023, although the statutes had yet to be voted on. The Vatican made it clear that this commission does not align with canon law, so, if the vote had taken place, it would be annulled. One of the controversies of this synodal committee is that it would call into question not only the authority of the pope, but also that of the bishops. For example, one of its purposes is to ensure the diocesan implementation of the decisions made in the German synod. The German Bishops' Conference has now assured that the intention is not to limit the authority of the bishops. We want to do everything possible to respond to the concerns of Rome, expressed in the letter: it is about the position of the episcopate. Synodality does not seek to weaken the episcopate, but to strengthen it. We do not want to limit in any way the authority of the bishop, of the bishops. The German bishops say that the synod in Rome and the German synodal journey are moving in the same direction towards the development of the Church. They also recognize the need for ongoing communication with Rome and say they will soon resume this dialogue. CA TR: AT",
