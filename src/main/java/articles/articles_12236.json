Exclusive time with the thought leaders who craft our research. The news: Artificial Intelligence could be worsening the made-for-advertising (MFA) problem. An ecommerce brand interviewed by Adweek said that as much as 40% of its recent purchases through Google’s Performance Max ended up on MFA sites. Notably, the brands in Adweek’s story did not discover their ad waste through Google’s tools. Instead, they relied on third-party services provided by Jounce and DeepSee.io. Their pursuit of third-party tools suggests a growing market for solutions to the MFA problem and a lack of transparency within Google’s own tools. Persistent problem: Despite efforts from Google and others to reduce the amount of MFA inventory plaguing digital advertising, Adweek’s report shows the problem hasn’t been dealt with–and AI is making it harder to quash. Our take: US ad spend wasted on MFA sites fell from 15% between September 2022 and January 2023 to 4% between January 2024 and May 2024, according to the Association of National Advertisers, suggesting the problem is diminishing. Still, the issue is far from being taken care of thanks to AI’s ability to rapidly generate junk websites that can go undetected. There are steps marketers can take to mitigate harm, like focusing less on high clickthrough rates and weighing long-term KPIs more heavily.

We approach games as they are.\n“We don’t have any external or extra motivations or a chip on our shoulder, except that it is an important ballgame for us and we need to be ready with our best effort,” added the Tropang Giga mentor.\nArticle continues after this advertisement It was that game where TNT fell victim to a last-second four-point shot courtesy of Converge import Scotty Hopson, the situation compounded at the worst way for the Tropang Giga when instructions to foul with the FiberXers in penalty were not heeded.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The Tropang Giga have since rebounded from that 96-95 loss with two consecutive victories, including the mastery of the Dyip despite missing Calvin Oftana due to a hip problem. A win over the FiberXers in their upcoming meeting may serve well for them moving forward.\nArticle continues after this advertisement 21.2 losing average “We’re on the same page here, we want to win and we got to do what we have to do; listening to coaches, going over the little things, learning from our mistakes from the last time we played them and staying focus for 48 minutes, you know, the game isn’t over till it’s over,” said Hollis-Jefferson.\n“So I feel like if we do that, we’ll be in a good bubble,” added Hollis-Jefferson, who racked up 26 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks for TNT despite playing through an ankle injury.\nArticle continues after this advertisement RR Pogoy, Poy Erram and Kim Aurin were also key for the Tropang Giga in sending the Dyip winless in the first round.\nTerrafirma was without two key players in Juami Tiongson and Kemark Carino, with the former perhaps the most sorely missed for his scoring ability.\nImport Antonio Hester and Christian Standhardinger, despite the shortage in manpower, did make Terrafirma stay close for three periods until TNT pulled away in the latter stretch of the fourth.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
