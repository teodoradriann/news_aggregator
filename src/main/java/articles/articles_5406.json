    "title": "Florida Escaped 'Biblical' Catastrophe Thanks to Hurricane Milton's Weakening, DeSantis Says",
    "text": "In a recent news conference, Governor Ron DeSantis announced Florida avoided a devastating “worst-case scenario” as Hurricane Milton weakened before making landfall. Though the storm caused significant damage and left millions without power, the state was spared from the catastrophic impact it initially feared Hurricane Milton struck the Florida coast Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm, a major hurricane but far less severe than the Category 4 or 5 that had been forecast earlier in its path. The storm made landfall near Siesta Key, about 70 miles south of Tampa, avoiding a direct hit on the heavily populated Tampa Bay area. Despite the hurricane’s weakening, Florida still experienced substantial destruction. The storm claimed at least 10 lives, knocked out electricity for over 3 million residents, and tore the roof off Tropicana Field, home to the Tampa Bay Rays. Flooding and wind damage were reported across the state, and recovery efforts will take time. Speaking at a press conference Thursday morning, DeSantis expressed relief that the storm wasn’t as devastating as it could have been. “The storm was significant, but thankfully, this was not the worst-case scenario,” he said. “The storm did weaken before landfall, and the storm surge, as initially reported, has not been as significant overall as what we saw with Hurricane Helene.” Hurricane Helene, which hit Florida just two weeks prior, caused widespread destruction, especially in the panhandle and surrounding areas. “Helene produced a major surge all across the west coast of Florida and the Big Bend area,” DeSantis said, describing its impact as “biblical.” By contrast, Milton’s storm surge was much lower, particularly north of the landfall zone. While Milton’s weakening brought relief, DeSantis reminded Floridians that the damage was still extensive. “We have much destruction and damage to deal with,” he said, noting that recovery would be a long process. Portions of the state received up to 18 inches of rain, and more than 6,500 National Guard personnel have been deployed to assist in relief efforts. Before Hurricane Milton made landfall, several Christian leaders had urged people of faith to pray for the storm to weaken. Evangelist Franklin Graham of Samaritan’s Purse and Bryant Wright of Send Relief, among others, called on Christians to seek God’s protection for the state. In hindsight, many Floridians see Milton’s reduction in strength as an answer to those prayers. The power of prayer has long been a source of comfort for those facing natural disasters, and this storm was no exception. Governor DeSantis acknowledged the faith community’s resilience and contributions during difficult times. “People of faith have always played an important role in these moments,” he said, thanking churches and organizations for their ongoing support of recovery efforts. As Florida begins the recovery process, DeSantis emphasized the need for continued teamwork and resilience. “I think everybody responded very quickly. I’m proud of everybody’s hard work,” he said. He assured Floridians that critical infrastructure, including the Tampa airport, should reopen by Friday. “We’ve got more work to do, but we will absolutely get through this.” The coming days and weeks will reveal the full extent of Hurricane Milton’s damage. However, the state’s quick response, combined with the storm’s weakening, prevented what could have been a far greater tragedy. As Floridians begin to rebuild, they are reminded of the importance of faith in the face of adversity. The prayers for protection may not have stopped the storm entirely, but many see Hurricane Milton’s weakening as a testament to God’s mercy and a reminder that hope and prayer can carry them through even the most challenging times. A Prayer for Florida’s Recovery Heavenly Father, we come before You with gratitude for sparing Florida from greater devastation during Hurricane Milton. We thank You for hearing the prayers of Your people and weakening the storm. Lord, we lift up those who have lost loved ones, homes, and security during this time. May You comfort them and give them peace. Guide and strengthen the responders, the National Guard, and all those working tirelessly to bring relief and restoration. We pray for the rebuilding of communities and the healing of broken lives. Let Your presence be felt in every step of the recovery process. May those affected by this storm draw closer to You, finding hope, comfort, and strength in Your love. In Jesus’ name, we pray, Amen.

Liderada por Paulo de Sousa, desde maio, a nova mesa pretende ficar com 5807 funcionários, para fazer cumprir um dos objetivos do plano de reestruturação que o novo provedor entregou à ministra do Trabalho, Solidariedade e Segurança Social: a redução da despesa com recursos humanos. As linhas gerais apresentadas a Maria do Rosário Palma Ramalho integravam o plano estratégico para 2024-2027. No plano, é discriminado “o peso das despesas com pessoal, que em 2022 representaram 63% das receitas totais, devido a uma estrutura de grande dimensão, excessivos níveis hierárquicos e inúmeros cargos de chefia\". A Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa ainda tem oficialmente ao serviço 6014 trabalhadores, com as despesas com recursos humanos a fixarem-se em 152 milhões de euros em 2023, e perspetivas de que superassem os 162,6 milhões em 2024. A dispensa de trabalhadores deverá passar por um plano de reformas antecipadas e pré-reformas: a Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa tem 1838 trabalhadores com 55 anos ou mais; 235 têm 65 ou mais anos, 1603 têm entre 60 e 64 anos e 1774 estão entre os 45 e os 54 anos.

    "text": "Davenport University recently held a Biological Laboratory Science (BLS) Career Forum on its W.A. Lettinga Grand Rapids Campus to connect students with leading professionals in the field.\nThe BLS Career Forum exemplified Davenport’s commitment to connecting the BLS, nursing, medical assisting and healthcare administration students with industry leaders and preparing them for successful transitions from the classroom to the workforce.\nThe event featured six accomplished professionals who shared industry highlights, personal career journeys, current roles, and advice for students and prospective employees. Two of the speakers are Davenport alumni, and one is a current instructor for Davenport.\nAshlyn Skidmore, associate scientist for Cayman Chemical and Davenport BLS alumna, spoke about her work in physical science and research. She shared tips and wisdom as a former Davenport student and highlighted her career journey, including working as a research technician at Van Andel Institute, before moving to her current role.\nZoie Amatore, Davenport BLS graduate and associate surgical sales consultant for Dilon Technologies, introduced students to the medical device and pharmaceutical sales field and highlighted the need for sales professionals with a strong science background. She also shared her experiences as a student at Davenport and how they shaped her career path to where she is now.\nDavenport forensic science adjunct instructor Bill Ruhf shared insights into forensic science, covering opportunities in law enforcement, government and military settings across Michigan and the world. Bill also talked about the technical skills required to enter the forensic science field and how Davenport’s BLS program prepares students for professional positions. He also shared stories of working as a forensic scientist.\nSpeaker Kevin Eggebeen, quality control manager with Perrigo, talked about the job opportunities available within the biotech and pharmaceutical fields, such as research and development, quality control, quality assurance, and manufacturing.\nJon Baker, director of labs at U of M Sparrow Health told students that the need for medical laboratory science professionals is high and advised them on what employers are looking for in prospective employees.\nFinally, Monique Carpenter, director of biologics technology at Zoetis, informed students of internship and job opportunities in animal health and research. She also stressed the importance of developing soft skills.\nThe Q&A portion of the forum gave students a chance to ask about career preparation, skill-building and what employers look for in new hires. Panelists emphasized the importance of soft skills (communication, adaptability and teamwork), hard skills (technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities), and character traits (hunger for knowledge, work ethic and the ability to prioritize tasks).\nThe forum concluded with one-on-one networking, where students engaged directly with panelists to explore career-specific advice, internship openings, and potential collaborations.\n“There were several big takeaways for students,” said Daniel Palmatier, chair of Davenport’s Science Department. “First, they learned about internship opportunities, and second, they learned about employer expectations, including the importance of a proactive mindset, critical thinking skills, and the ability to work independently and collaboratively.”\nFurthermore, the event reinforced the Science Department’s motto: “Creating Tomorrow’s Scientists Today.” Palmatier said the Science Department looks forward to building on this success by strengthening partnerships with participating employers and continuing to open doors for its students’ bright futures.\nPalmatier said the employers who attended the forum expressed strong interest in continuing collaborations with Davenport University, signaling potential partnerships to support student internships, job placements, and professional development.",
