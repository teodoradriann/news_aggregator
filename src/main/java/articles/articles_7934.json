    "text": "By Dan Williams and Nidal al-Mughrabi\nJERUSALEM/DOHA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Israel prepared to advance its\nwar on Gaza farther south, close to the Egyptian border, after claiming to have dismantled Hamas in Khan Younis, as diplomatic efforts in pursuit of a ceasefire accelerated.\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday that success in the fight against the Palestinian militants in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a major ground attack last week, meant its forces could advance to Rafah on the enclave's southern border.\nMore than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people are sheltering in this area, mainly cold and hungry in makeshift tents and public buildings.\n\"We are achieving our missions in Khan Younis, and we will also reach Rafah and eliminate terror elements that threaten us,\" Gallant said in a statement.\nAt the same time, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoped for a positive response from Hamas, which runs Gaza, to the first concrete proposal for an extended halt to fighting, agreed with Israel and the U.S. at talks in Paris last week.\nA Palestinian official close to the negotiations told Reuters the text envisages a first phase of 40 days, during which fighting would cease while Hamas freed remaining civilians among the more than 100 hostages it still holds. Further phases would see the handover of Israeli soldiers and bodies of dead hostages.\nSuch a long pause would be a first since Oct. 7, when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, precipitating an Israeli offensive that has laid waste to much of Gaza.\nHealth officials in the enclave said on Thursday the confirmed Palestinian death toll had risen above 27,000, with thousands more dead still lying under the rubble.\nNO RESPONSE FROM HAMAS YET TO PROPOSAL\nA Palestinian official said Hamas was unlikely to reject the proposal outright, but would demand guarantees that fighting would not resume, something Israel has not agreed to.\nThere was brief elation in Gaza on Thursday after remarks by a Qatari spokesman at Johns Hopkins University in Washington sparked ceasefire hopes - and a drop in the price of crude oil.\nBut Qatari officials in the capital Doha and Taher Al-Nono, media adviser to Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, said the group had not responded yet.\nGaza residents said Israeli forces pounded areas around hospitals in Khan Younis, and stepped up attacks close to Rafah. Combat has also surged in recent days in northern areas around Gaza City that Israel claimed to have subdued weeks ago.\nOsama Ahmed, 49, a father of five from Gaza City now sheltering in western Khan Younis, said there had been fierce resistance in the city, and relentless bombardment from air, ground and sea as Israeli tanks advanced.\n\"All we want is a ceasefire now,\" he told Reuters by phone.\nAn air strike on a house in Khan Younis wounded 13 people on Thursday, according to hospital officials.\nAppeals to Israel from its main ally, the United States, show little sign of having succeeded in easing the plight of Gaza's civilians.\nWashington is stepping up indirect pressure, however.\nU.S. President\nJoe Biden issued an executive order that aims to punish Jewish settlers who attack Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in an surge of violence triggered by the war in Gaza.\nBiden is also under pressure to respond to the killing of three U.S. soldiers by a drone in Jordan last week, the first U.S. deaths in an escalation of violence across the Middle East since Israel's war in Gaza began in October.\nThe United States, which has said it does not want to ignite a wider war, believes the drone, which also wounded more than 40 people, was made by Iran, four U.S. officials told Reuters.\nCBS News reported on Thursday that targets for U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the killings include \"Iranian personnel and facilities\", citing American officials.\nThe U.S. is continuing its strikes with allies against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen, which has attacked shipping in the Red Sea in what it says is solidarity with Gaza.\nThe U.S. military said it had hit up to 10 drones in Yemen being prepared for launch, while a U.S. Navy ship downed three Iranian-made drones and a Houthi anti-ship missile\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Doha, Paul Grant in Washington, Tala Ramadan and Jana Choukeir in Dubai, Dan Williams and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; Writing by Cynthia Osterman; Editing by Diane Craft)\n(( ;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

My love and adoration for him only grows.\" Video above: Emma Heming Willis 'not good' amid husband Bruce Willis' dementia battle The couple wed in 2009 and share two daughters together, Mabel and Evelyn. Heming also posted a vulnerable message to her [\"Die Hard\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/24/entertainment/peter-billingsley-die-hard-christmas/index.html) actor's [health issues](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/entertainment/bruce-willis-moonlighting-creator/index.html), sharing in the video that she \"was able to have a good cry\" with a close friend. \"It is really important to be able to have someone that you can trust with your feelings instead of just bottling them up and putting your best foot forward and just kind of soldiering through stuff, which I have a tendency to do,\" Heming said in the video. In February, Willis's family – including Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore and his daughters – [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html) that the actor has been diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or [FTD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737) for short. Heming, who has been open about her journey as Willis's primary caretaker on her social media ever since, said in her video this week that \"holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard.\" She added that \"building a community and connection\" has helped her get through it this year. \"That has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that,\" she said. Heming wrote in the caption to her Instagram video about receiving \"countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved,\" and that these messages help her feel \"less alone.\" \"I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much,\" she wrote. \"I am grateful to you.\"",
