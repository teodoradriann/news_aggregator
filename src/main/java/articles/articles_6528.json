    "text": "LAHORE: The city of Lahore witnessed another record-breaking spell of monsoon showers on Thursday, recording 350 millimetres of rain in just three hours to surpass a 44-year-old record. Heavy downpour flooded streets, homes, and low-lying areas while disrupting electricity feeders massively across the city. The highest rainfall was recorded at Lahore Airport with 337 millimetres, followed by Pani Wala Talab at 203 millimetres, Lakshmi Chowk at 191 millimetres, Upper Mall at 182 millimetres, Mughalpura at 173 millimetres, Tajpura at 180 millimetres, Nishtar Town at 227 millimetres, and Chowk Nakhuda at 163 millimetres. This is the second heavy rainfall of this monsoon season, with more than 300 mm being recorded. Tajpura had previously recorded 315 mm. In response, the Commissioner Lahore has declared a rain emergency and announced holidays for offices and schools to prevent damage. Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz has ordered the early drainage of water in Lahore and other affected cities. An alert has been issued to the relevant departments, and administrative officers and workers have been instructed to stay in the field. A girl was reported dead while another five citizens received injuries in two separate incidents of roof collapse. Meanwhile, hospitals were inundated with rainy water causing immense problems for patients and their attendants. It may be noted that Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had reported a day earlier that strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are likely to bring torrential rains to upper parts of the country from August 1 to 6, with intermittent breaks. Lahore’s rainfall led to significant flooding in areas such as Mall Road, Ferozepur Road, Model Town, Faisal Town, Lakshmi Chowk, and Anarkali. In Tajpura, rainwater entered homes, while the Services Hospital faced flooding, creating challenges for patients and medical staff. National Highways and Motorway Police (NH&MP) spokesperson said intermittent rain is continuing at most places on the national highways. He said that rainfall was recorded from Motorway M2 till Pindi Bhattian, Sheikhupura, Kala Shah Kaku and Thokar Niaz Baig, while Manga Mandi, Patuki, Renala Khurd and Okara were also drenched in rainwater. Meanwhile, Motorway M3 from Faizpur to Nankana Sahib also received heavy rain. Copyright Business Recorder, 2024",

    "title": "Gaza: Israel’s destruction of hundreds of dunams of agricultural land is expression of its insistence on committing genocide",
    "text": "Palestinian Territory - Israel has destroyed hundreds of dunams of agricultural land, depriving Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip of agricultural land and resources vital to survival, all in support of its illegal blockade of the Strip and tight restrictions on the entry of food supplies for almost a full year. This is an expression of Israel’s insistence on committing genocide against Palestinians in the enclave. This destruction is part of a larger Israeli plan that dates back to last October. Under this plan, Israeli forces have worked to eliminate almost 80% of the agricultural land in the Gaza Strip from use by Palestinians. Israel has done this either by isolating it in preparation for its forcible annexation to the so-called “buffer zone” or by bulldozing or destroying it by other means, such as bombardment—all of which are in violation of international law. According to the Euro-Med Monitor field team, Israeli forces stormed the area of Al-Shimaa in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, early on Tuesday morning (25 September 2024). Accompanied by military bulldozers, the forces began their bulldozing operations, destroying more than 500 dunums of newly replanted agricultural land, which was supposed to sustain the needs of the people living in northern Gaza, who are subject to an arbitrary siege and systematic starvation by Israel. The Israeli destruction of these agricultural lands, the majority of which were filled with eggplants, reflects Israel’s insistence on preventing the Palestinian people from depending on the region’s agricultural food basket during a period when sufficient supplies of vegetables and other foods are being kept out of the northern Gaza Strip. This has led to a severe famine, to the point where a significant portion of the people in the north have been forced to eat tree leaves and bake ground-up animal feed instead of flour. Twenty-four-year-old farmer Yousef Saqr Abu Rabie of Beit Lahia told Euro-Med Monitor about the significant losses he incurred on Monday and Tuesday, 23-24 September, as a result of the bulldozing of dozens of dunams north of the town. Abu Rabie stated that although his land is outside of the “security zone” established by Israel at the start of the war, the bulldozing operations still occurred, and that the now-bulldozed crops had been bearing fruit that the people of northern Gaza were depending on given Israel’s restrictions on the entry of fruits and vegetables into the northern Gazan markets. As part of its crime of genocide, ongoing since 7 October 2023, Israel has worked over the past year to systematically and extensively destroy the Gaza Strip’s food basket of fruits, vegetables, and meat, along with all other components of local food production, in addition to blocking the entry of food and humanitarian aid. This has resulted in famine in the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces have bulldozed or otherwise destroyed all agricultural lands along the “security fence” separating the eastern and northern Gaza Strip at a depth of nearly two kilometres, removing approximately 96 square kilometres in a clear attempt to annex them to its “buffer zone”, in violation of international law. An Israeli “buffer” road and zone splitting Gaza City through its centre, meanwhile, and the creation of Israel’s Netzarim axis to keep sections of the Strip separate, have resulted in the destruction of approximately three square kilometres of agricultural lands. Thus, the agricultural lands destroyed by Israel to enable the creation of its “buffer” areas, specifically, represent about 27.5% of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli occupation army has worked to destroy almost all buildings and facilities on the vast majority of these lands, which are now within the “buffer zone” and are off-limits to residents and farmers. These lands represented the majority of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip and included hundreds of farms built on hundreds of dunams that were planted with vegetables and fruits, as well as hundreds of farms raising poultry and livestock. Outside of this “buffer zone”, additional land has been destroyed by Israeli incursions or aerial and artillery bombardment, resulting in the destruction of at least 34 square kilometres of agricultural land and the streets that service it. This brings the total percentage of destroyed land in the Gaza Strip to 36.9%, or more than 75% of the Strip’s area designated for agriculture. Of the very few remaining areas set aside for agriculture, the majority are in the region of Al-Mawasi in the southern Gaza Strip, west of Khan Yunis, which is now home to hundreds of thousands of people who have been forcibly displaced. In addition to Israel’s destruction of thousands of farms, greenhouses, water wells, tanks, and stores housing agricultural equipment, Euro-Med Monitor field teams recorded the intentional killing of numerous farmers while these individuals were working or attempting to access their lands. Since the start of the genocide, the Israeli army has also killed several fishermen and destroyed the majority of fishing boats and fishing ports in the Gaza Strip. These actions have negatively impacted the availability of healthy food for over 2.2 million Palestinians living in the Strip, and the repercussions of this are expected to last for years after the withdrawal of the Israeli military. Farmers are finding it difficult or impossible to access areas that have been spared from the Israeli bombing, due to the ongoing bombardment and ground incursions into numerous areas. Additionally, the lack of electricity, destruction of water wells, and scarcity of fuel all make it difficult to cultivate new areas and irrigate them with water. This occurs while aid supplies are being blocked from reaching residents and displaced people in the Strip by Israeli army forces. The ongoing Israeli military assaults have detrimental effects on soil, air, water quality, agricultural land, public health, and the environment. These effects compound over time, and at some point, may result in startling increases in the death rate. The internationally recognised human right to food, water, and sanitation is a basic right that protects population health and dignity. It can only be realised if the international community puts an end to Israel’s crime of genocide; removes the illegal blockade on the Gaza Strip; and salvages what remains of the besieged enclave, which is currently uninhabitable on all fronts. Delays will cause the Strip to deteriorate further, cost more civilian lives, and heavily affect people’s health outcomes. The international community must act swiftly and forcefully to end to Israel’s crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, which involves both the direct killing of, and the imposition of unbearable living conditions on, the Palestinian people there. Israel is attempting to rob Palestinians of all hope of survival by turning the Strip into a place without any of the basic necessities of life. The international community should make sure that humanitarian aid—particularly the basic food and non-food supplies required to respond to the humanitarian crisis safely and effectively—reaches the Gaza Strip swiftly, particularly the northern part of the Strip. In order to save the civilian population in the Gaza Strip from the threat of further health disasters, pressure must also be applied to Israel to permit the entry of materials required for infrastructure rehabilitation and repair. This includes ensuring that there is enough fuel entering the Occupied Palestinian Territory to run desalination plants and wells, among other water and sanitation facilities.",

    "title": "Comment on Spiced Oatmeal Cookies by Kate",
    "text": "My grandmother Virginia makes the best cookies. When my cousins and I were growing up, she always kept homemade cookies stashed in old cookie tins in the freezer (I bet she has some in her freezer now, too). She’d open up a canister and unfold the waxed paper lining, and we’d start grabbing for one after another. I like her cookies straight from the freezer; they have a more satisfying chew that way. I like them at room temp and fresh from the oven, too.\nThe cookies that stand out most in my memory are her oatmeal, dried cranberry and macadamia nut cookies. Or does she use white chocolate chips, not macadamia nuts? Grandma will tell me. She’s eighty-four, operates a brand new iPhone, and receives my new blog posts by email. She reads your comments, too. :)\nShe’d tell you that I wanted to do things my way when I was little. Guess I’m still doing it, because I came up with my own oatmeal cookie recipe instead of asking for hers (I’ll get it later, for sure). I wanted oatmeal cookies with a soft, fluffy interior and crisper edges with more concentrated flavor. I wanted these cookies to be even more redeeming than most, but mostly to be the tastiest of oatmeal cookies.\nInstead of adding dried cranberries and macadamia nuts (or white chocolate chips), I kept these simple with some cinnamon and nutmeg, which permeate the whole cookie with delicious warming spices. More specifically, I used Frontier Co-op’s Ceylon cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract, which are all organic. Frontier Co-op has generously filled my spice drawer with their products and the more I use them, the more I appreciate them. Take a whiff and you’ll know what I mean; they’re more potent and offer superior flavor than other brands. Plus, you can read where the spices came from on the bottle. I’m glad to be working with them again this winter.\nThese cookies are made with 100 percent whole grains—lots of old-fashioned oats, some oat flour (which you can easily yourself make out of oats, see notes) and some whole wheat flour (check the recipe notes for alternatives). Oat flour lends extra oat flavor and a light-as-air texture, and whole wheat flour offers enough structure to keep these cookies together. I know it’s a bit of a pain to use multiple flours, but this combination is really key to awesome oatmeal cookies.\nLastly, I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, which is less processed and contains some potassium. I’ve been able to find it at all of the grocery stores that I frequent lately, usually in the health food section but sometimes in the regular baking section. I had to use a couple of tablespoons of cane sugar to get the texture and sweetness level just right.\nI hope these cookies make it to your holiday tables. Since they are on the softer/more delicate side, I wouldn’t recommend trying to pack these for shipping (\nthese macaroons are perfect for that). Please let me know how they turn out for you!\nSpiced Oatmeal Cookies\n- Author:\nCookie and Kate\n- Prep Time: 15 mins\n- Cook Time: 12 mins\n- Total Time: 27 minutes\n- Yield: 24 cookies 1x\n- Category: Cookie\n- Method: Baked\n- Cuisine: American\nThese oatmeal cookies are truly the best. They’re soft and fluffy in the middle, with crisper edges and lovely flavor, thanks to warming spices and oat flour. Recipe yields about 2 dozen cookies.\nIngredients\n- ½ cup (1 stick/8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened*\n- ½ cup packed coconut sugar\n- 2 tablespoons sugar (I used organic cane sugar)\n- 1 large egg\n- 1 ½ teaspoons\nFrontier Co-Op vanilla extract\n- 1 teaspoon\nFrontier Co-op ground Ceylon cinnamon\n- ½ teaspoon\nFrontier Co-op ground nutmeg\n- ½ teaspoon baking soda\n- ¼ teaspoon baking powder\n- ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt\n- 1 ¾ cup old-fashioned oats\n- ⅓ cup oat flour**\n- ⅓ cup white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour***\nInstructions\n- Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper, or lightly grease them.\n- In a medium mixing bowl, combine the butter, coconut sugar and cane sugar. With a hand-held electric mixer or by hand, beat them together until they are fully incorporated and lighter in color.\n- Add the egg and vanilla and beat well, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder and salt, and blend until combined.\n- Lastly, add the oats, oat flour and whole wheat flour. Blend on low speed until combined. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula, and mix briefly to be sure it’s evenly blended.\n- With a cookie dough scoop or two spoons, scoop about 1 tablespoon of dough at a time onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches of space around each cookie.\n- Bake the cookies for 12 to 13 minutes, until they’re a light golden brown with slightly darker edges. Their middles may still look a tiny bit shiny; that’s OK, they’ll continue to bake as they cool on the pan.\n- Remove the cookies from the oven, place the pan on a cooling rack, and let the cookies cool completely on the pan before handling (these cookies are delicate when warm). Repeat with any remaining cookies.\nNotes\nRecipe created with reference to The Kitchn’s\nchewy oatmeal cookies and Serious Eats’ ultimate chocolate chip cookie guide.\n*How to soften butter: I just microwaved mine in a bowl for 20 to 30 seconds. Or, let it soften on your stovetop while you preheat the oven until it’s soft and slightly melty.\n**How to make your own oat flour: In a blender or food processor, blend up about ½ cup old-fashioned oats until you have a fine flour. You will have some extra flour left over (it stores well, so I always make extra for future baking projects).\n***Flour alternatives: You can also use gluten-free all-purpose flour or regular all-purpose flour.\nMake it gluten free: Use gluten-free all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat. Be sure to use certified gluten-free oats and oat flour (or make your own out of certified gluten-free oats).\nMake it dairy free: Replace the softened butter with room temperature coconut oil.\nIf you want to add mix-ins: You can fold in up to 1 ½ cups chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and/or chopped nuts at the end, just before you scoop the dough. You might need to bake the cookies a minute or two longer, given the increase in volume.\n▸ Nutrition Information\nfull nutrition disclosure here.\nThis post is sponsored by Frontier Co-Op and I received compensation for my participation.

    "title": "To protect the planet’s rangelands, give pastoralists a boost, UN report says",
    "text": "In May, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) released its “Global Land Outlook,” report which focused on the role that pastoralism can play in conserving rangelands. Rangelands, which include deserts, grasslands and savannas, cover 54% of the planet’s terrestrial surface. Pastoralist communities have often been framed as a threat to wildlife and conservation; in East Africa, many still face harsh grazing restrictions or eviction from their traditional landscapes. But the UNCCD report said that sustainable grazing practices can boost both carbon storage and soil fertility, and that pastoralism is vital to protecting the world’s rangelands. When it comes to conservation, forests and oceans are the big attention grabbers. But rangelands, which cover 54% of the planet’s terrestrial surface, are no less important for nature and wildlife. With ecosystems as varied as deserts, grasslands, semiarid shrublands and savannas, a third of global biodiversity hotspots fall within rangelands. More than 40% of the African continent is rangeland, including some of its most iconic landscapes, like the Serengeti or South Africa’s Highveld.\nJust like its forests and oceans, though, the world’s rangelands are under threat. Climate change, industrial food production, mineral extraction and unsustainable livestock practices all contribute to rangeland degradation. According to a report released by the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in May, up to a third of global rangelands are at risk of such degradation, which can include desertification, soil fertility and biodiversity loss, or conversion into plantations, including ones that generate carbon credits from non-native tree species.\nThe consequences of rangeland degradation can be far-reaching. Wildlife that once roamed vast landscapes are squeezed, water gets scarcer, and devastating sandstorms become more common. Rangeland loss also contributes to climate change — nearly one-third of the global carbon pool is contained inside their grasses, soil and vegetation. Despite all this, they rarely take center stage at international conferences to address climate change and biodiversity loss.\nAnd there’s another reason why the planet’s rangelands are important: they’re where a big portion of our food supply comes from. Sixteen percent of global food production takes place on rangelands, and they generate a whopping 70% of feed for domesticated herbivores like cows, goats and camels. Around 2 billion people’s livelihoods depend on these landscapes, including 200 million pastoralist households, which produce around one-tenth of the world’s meat.\nThe UNCCD says those pastoralists are the key to protecting the planet’s threatened rangelands.\n“If we don’t manage to understand how pastoralists think and manage the land, how they are mobile and flexible, how they interpret the landscape under different conditions, we are going to end up degrading the whole Earth’s rangeland system,” said Pedro Herrera, the report’s lead author.\nSamburu pastoralists walking with their herd in Isiolo County, Kenya.

From Central Asia to East Africa, its practitioners have traditionally moved their herds across vast distances in search of water and seasonal grazing spots. But they’ve often fared badly in the age of industrialization. Governments looking to modernize have framed pastoralism as an archaic and outdated way of life, at times implementing policies meant to push them toward more sedentary livelihoods like farm-style livestock rearing.\nConservationists haven’t always been friendly toward pastoralists, either, in many cases seeing their herds as competition for threatened wildlife that live in and around grazing areas. Around 12% of global rangelands are classified as protected areas. Some were established through the violent eviction of pastoralist communities, and in many of them, grazing is now outright banned.\nIt’s not all a matter of ancient history, either. In Tanzania, Maasai pastoralists have been subject to forced removals in recent years as part of a tourism-focused expansion of national park lands.\nAccording to Herrera, such policies aren’t just a human rights abuse; they’re bad ecosystem management.\n“If we evict pastoralists from a place thinking this will reduce grazing pressure so the rangelands will recover, we are totally mismanaging [them],” he said. “They need proper management to increase the organic matter in the soil, to remove dry vegetation, and to accelerate the nutrient cycles.”\nThe UNCCD report said that while unchecked grazing can damage grasslands, removing pastoralists or restricting their movement can lead to a reduction in soil fertility. Instead, it called for the integration of pastoralism into rangeland management planning.\nEncouraging sustainable grazing practices on some rangelands would help to regenerate and protect them, Herrera told Mongabay. It would also act as a climate solution. While some carbon credit-generating grazing projects have been controversial , seasonal livestock plans that allow vegetation to regrow are a natural way to remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n“When we promote rotational grazing, when we respect the resting periods, when we apply thoughtful pastoralist-based grazing plans, the amount of carbon in the soil will increase,” he said.\nThe UNCCD report comes as threats to pastoralists have increased across Africa. Along with conservation-related restrictions in some countries, clashes between herders and farmers — partly due to climate change and land-use pressures — continue to plague West Africa . Climate-related drought has devastated herding communities in Kenya. And in the Sahel, pastoralist grievances have played a major role in fueling Islamist insurgencies that have toppled governments and become one of the continent’s biggest security concerns.\n“Pastoralists have been caught up in regional instability and conflict, becoming involved in jihadist and secessionist groups,” said Ian Scoones, principal investigator of the PASTRES project, an EU-funded research program. “This is a response to long-term neglect by states of pastoralists’ needs, with other groups offering alternatives in tough conditions.”\nRather than neglecting or pushing pastoralist communities to the fringes, Herrera told Mongabay the world should be looking to learn from them.\n“Pastoralists and rangeland people know how to deal with very uncertain conditions. They know how to deal with droughts, with sandstorms, with freezing, with many weather inclemencies, and to keep producing in a sustainable way. That’s a very important lesson for the future,” he said.\nBanner image: A pastoralist in Somalia. Image via Rawpixel.",

    "text": "Курсантов академии ГКНБ обяжут вернуть средства за учёбу, если их отчислят или они откажутся от службы\nБилим АКИpress - Жогорку Кенеш 26 июня в третьем чтении принял проект закона «О внесении изменения в закон «Об органах национальной безопасности» касательно обучения в академии ГКНБ А.Бакаева.\nИнициатор законопроекта — Кабмин. Докладчиком выступает ГКНБ.\nВ справке-обосновании говорится, что проект закона разработан в целях повышения эффективности использования средств республиканского бюджета, выделяемых для финансирования специализированных государственных образовательных организаций высшего профессионального образования (очная форма, бюджетная).\nВ статье 22 закона «Об органах национальной безопасности» предлагается предусмотреть обязанность курсантов Академии ГКНБ на возмещение бюджетных средств, в случаях отчисления по причинам, зависящим от самого обучающегося (отчисление).\nСейчас такие требования распространяются в отношении граждан КР, зачисленных в образовательные организации и получившие за счет бюджетных средств образование по медицинским, фармацевтическим, педагогическим специальностям, а также по специальностям правоохранительной деятельности.\n«Возложение на курсантов обязанности возместить бюджетные средства, затраченные на их обучение, при отчислении за неуспеваемость, недисциплинированность, в связи с осуждением, а также при отказе проходить военную службу по собственной инициативе, полностью отвечает интересам государства и принципам разумности и справедливости. Такая мера позволяет рационально использовать выделенные на военное образование бюджетные средства, укрепляет дисциплину и ответственность будущих военных специалистов, а также способствует эффективному комплектованию органов национальной безопасности», - отмечено в справке-обосновании.\nСтатью 22 закона предлагается дополнить следующим образом:\n9¹. Курсанты обязаны возместить государству бюджетные средства, затраченные на их обучение в случаях:\n1) отчисления из образовательной организации уполномоченного государственного органа за неуспеваемость, недисциплинированность, в связи с осуждением;\n2) отказа проходить военную службу во время обучения либо по окончании военного учебного заведения по его инициативе.\nЗа событиями в Кыргызстане следите в Телеграм-канале @akipress.\nПерепечатка материала невозможна без согласия редакции и подписания официального договора.",
