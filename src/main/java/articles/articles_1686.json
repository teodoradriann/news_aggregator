    "text": "Famille, élus et admirateurs ont commémoré jeudi les 50 ans de la mort de Marcel Pagnol, visitant le site d'un futur musée consacré à l'auteur, dramaturge et cinéaste, qui doit ouvrir en 2026 près de Marseille.\nAvant un temps de recueillement au petit cimetière de la Treille, dans l'est de Marseille, où il est enterré, une \"promenade Marcel et Jacqueline Pagnol\" a été inaugurée, au pied des collines dans lesquelles le jeune Marcel venait jouer pendant ses vacances, ainsi qu'il l'a raconté dans ses célébrissimes souvenirs d'enfance, \"La gloire de mon père\" ou \"Le château de ma mère\".\nJacqueline Pagnol, actrice et dernière épouse de l'auteur, qui repose à ses côtés au cimetière de la Treille, tourna dans plusieurs de ses films. Il écrivit notamment pour elle \"Manon des sources\".\n\"Pour tous elle restera Manon des sources, la fée des collines, et je suis certain que l'esprit de Marcel et de Manon-Jacqueline gambade encore un peu dans ces collines\", a lancé Nicolas Pagnol, leur petit-fils, président des sociétés gestionnaires des droits des œuvres de l'auteur.\n\"On parle souvent de Marcel et on oublie un peu Jacqueline,\" a dit de ses côtés la présidente du conseil départemental Martine Vassal (divers droite), saluant ce couple qui \"aimait la Provence, qui aimait notre territoire\".\nElle s'est félicitée de l'ouverture annoncée du futur musée Marcel-Pagnol à Allauch, commune limitrophe de Marseille où la famille du jeune Marcel Pagnol avait sa résidence estivale: un \"projet structurant, important, valorisant\".\nMarcel Pagnol et son épouse Jacqueline Bouvier-Pagnol, dans leur domaine de l'Etoile, à Cagnes-sur-Mer, le 9 juillet 1947\n- - AFP/Archives\n\"Allauch sera le coeur de la +pagnolie+ avec ce beau musée\", a estimé de son côté Nicolas Pagnol, qui apportera un important fonds d'objets, souvenirs et documents au futur musée, installé dans une ancienne usine de la compagnie \"Energie électrique du littoral méditerranéen\", en activité de 1906 à 1960 et en cours de rénovation par la mairie.\n\"C'est un combat de plus de 20 ans que je suis très heureux de voir se concrétiser ici, où Marcel a passé selon lui les plus belles années de sa vie\", a dit le petit-fils de l'écrivain.\nAFP / Marseille (AFP) / © 2024 AFP",

    "title": "The real reason Trump isn’t actually trying to win the debate — or the election",
    "text": "The real reason Trump isn’t actually trying to win the debate — or the election\nI was reading about the first debate, to be aired tonight at 9 pm on CNN, when I came across this item\nin USA Today: Donald “Trump has foregone traditional debate prep. He's received verbal policy briefings and keeping up with the news, a Trump campaign official said. But he has not done practice rounds against a stand-in for [Joe] Biden.\"\nThat’s it.\nIn the whole story, there’s one thin paragraph about his preparation, or lack of it. It came after many thick paragraphs describing Biden’s labors. He has spent the last week at Camp David, practicing for his “faceoff … in a television studio in Atlanta,” where there will be no audience and microphones will be silenced while the other is speaking.\n“Former White House chief of staff Ron Klain is leading his prep,” USA Today\nreported. “Biden’s campaign has declined to say who’s playing Trump, although it is said to be Biden attorney Bob Bauer.”\nThe\nnewspaper went on to say: “Biden’s early prep work typically involves group brainstorming sessions with his staff that hone in on topics and messaging, said Bill Russo, a former longtime aide to Biden who was the deputy communications director for his 2020 campaign. The second phase is about knocking [Trump] off his game, Russo said.”\n“The purpose of doing the mocks is really to kind of make sure that that punch in the face happens not for the first time on the debate stage, in front of a national audience, but behind the scenes,” he added.\nSo the president is taking the debate seriously, regarding it as an opportunity to bring more attention to the election, to expand his base with people who have not been paying attention to politics, to remind these “undecided” voters of Trump’s final years in office, “when a deadly contagion was ravaging the country and a violent mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in an effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden,” and perhaps even “change the narrative about his age,” the\nnewspaper said.\nMeanwhile, Trump (who is 78; Biden is 81) isn’t taking the debate seriously. He hasn’t prepared. He hasn’t studied. He hasn’t done any homework. He doesn’t see it as an opportunity to expand his base. (That’s why he’s lying about Biden’s “\ndrug use.”) He doesn’t seem to care whether more people are paying more attention to the election. And he seems immune to concerns about his age, despite exposing his habitual incoherence during a recent meeting of America's top CEOs.\nWhat’s happening here?\nHe isn’t trying to win.\nTrump is not trying to win the debate, same as he’s not trying to win the election. Biden is trying. Trump isn’t. The difference is Biden will accept the outcome of the debate, just as he will accept the outcome of the election. Trump won’t. He’s a winner. He’s already won. He never lost the last election. That there’s a debate to go through, and an election, is a technicality. Trump owns reality. We have to comply.\nThe debate is like a test. You can prepare for it and hope for the best, or you can slack off and suffer the inevitable consequences. Biden is preparing, because he can’t slack off. He can’t slack off, because the stakes are of his own making. They are of his own making, because he is committed to accepting the outcome of the debate and the election.\nThere are no stakes for Trump.\nLet that sink in.\nThere can be no stakes, because there are never stakes for a man who denies accountability. There is literally no risk when consequences are for someone else. Trump could piss himself – on purpose, not accidentally – and it would make no difference. He would declare victory any which way, if only by running down his opponent even harder than before, with the help, of course, of the Republican Party, the rightwing media apparatus, and Russian and Chinese operatives.\nWhen you deny that causes have effects, you can tell whatever lie you want, and if you have enough people behind you, the lie becomes real.\nThink about it. Everything about this election presumes something so big that it’s invisible to the naked eye, which is that Donald Trump is trying to win. But why would an authoritarian, who refuses to concede that Biden win, try to win the current one? There is no point when you never lost the last one. Why prepare for a debate when you’re going to declare yourself the winner? Preparation is for suckers and losers.\nWhen you think about it even more, it makes more sense. Why isn’t Trump trying to expand his base? Why does he keep saying things that alienate independent voters and some Republicans? Why does he play footsie with unpopular policies, like a national abortion ban? Why does he actually say that\nhe doesn’t need any more votes than the ones he already has? (It’s not because he thinks he secured a majority.) Why does he keep doubling down on his base as if that’s all that matters?\nBecause winning isn’t the point.\nCheating is.\nAnd he’s going to do that by accusing Biden and the Democrats of cheating. He could piss himself on live television tonight, but it wouldn’t be his fault, because Biden’s nose is a snowblower. (Or because CNN “rigged” the debate or because Jake Tapper hates him or because\nChoose Your Own Adventure.) Same thing for the election.\nHe and the Republicans have lied so much that,\naccording to the Post, “his campaign and the Republican National Committee are spending historic sums building ‘election integrity’ operations in key battleground states, preparing to challenge results in court, and recruiting large armies of grassroots supporters to monitor voting locations and counting facilities and to serve as poll workers.”\nWhy try to win when you can hire thugs to intimidate voters and harass election officials? Why try when you find friendly judges to invalidate your opponent’s votes? Why play by the rules of the game when the rules of the game don’t apply to you? You’re playing your own. Campaigning for president is for suckers and losers. Who wants to be a president? Despotism is for winners. Despots rule.\nSo much of Donald Trump’s campaigning does not make sense, but that’s because we’re trying to understand it as if he were a normal presidential candidate who is trying to win by normal means.\nAs Rex Huppke reminded us,\nhe ain’t.\nThe more we insist he is, the less we understand. Indeed, I think, the more we insist, the more we are blind to dangers that are coming.",

    "text": "Bar e ristoranti lamentano ormai da tempo la difficoltà a trovare personale. In loro aiuto arriva Restworld, piattaforma di ricerca dei lavoratori focalizzata sul settore della ristorazione e già utilizzata da oltre 800 imprenditori e imprenditrici e più di 150.000 lavoratori in tutta Italia. L'obiettivo per il 2025 è di raggiungere quota 3.000 ristoranti iscritti alla piattaforma e di espandersi sul mercato europeo e nordamericano, a livello globale entro il 2027.\n La start up - che conta su un team di psicologi, ingegneri ed economisti - offre un servizio dalla doppia valenza che risponde alle esigenze di domanda e di offerta nel mondo della ristorazione e dell'hotellerie: da una parte è una piattaforma di ricerca e selezione del personale nel settore Ho.Re.Ca., dall'altra è una mappa interattiva delle offerte di lavoro disponibili sul territorio. Nel primo caso, grazie al supporto di customer success manager dedicati e all'aiuto della tecnologia, si prende in carico la ricerca e la selezione di personale qualificato da proporre a ristoratori e manager. Allo stesso tempo, Restworld è una mappa interattiva delle posizioni aperte - filtrabili attraverso una serie di parametri - che permette ai candidati di trovare autonomamente le strutture presso le quali candidarsi con la sicurezza che le realtà presenti sulla piattaforma siano state selezionate in base a requisiti etici e sostenibili.\n \"Garantiamo ai lavoratori un trattamento equo dal punto di vista personale e professionale, e ricerchiamo per le aziende i migliori candidati possibili\", spiega il ceo Luca Lotterio, classe 1993, uno dei fondatori di Restworld con Davide Lombardi e Lorenzo D'Angelo, anche loro 'under 30'.\n Restworld ha deciso, infatti, di dotarsi di un Codice Etico, \"una carta dei valori per accrescere la consapevolezza delle imprese che operano nel settore Ho.Re.Ca., migliorare il benessere operativo, raggiungere le pari opportunità, investire sulla formazione del personale, fornire supporto alla digital transformation del settore. E promuovere ambienti di lavoro sicuri, equi e inclusivi\".",

    "title": "Two-time champion Osaka falls to Muchova at US Open - Breitbart",
    "text": "Two-time champion Naomi Osaka’s return to the US Open ended in the second round on Thursday with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) loss to 52nd-ranked Czech Karolina Muchova. Japan’s Osaka, who won the title in 2018 and 2020, missed last year’s edition after the birth of her daughter Shai. She hasn’t reached the third round of a Grand Slam since the 2022 Australian Open. She has been unable to build momentum in her comeback and her first round win over Jelena Ostapenko was her first in four years over a top-10 player. Muchova was another tough opponent. A semi-finalist at New York last year, she reached a high of eighth in the world before she missed nine months after undergoing wrist surgery. “Honestly, this year the biggest win for me is that I could play again,” said Muchova, who had played just a dozen matches since returning at Eastbourne in June. “I’m really grateful I’m able to play tennis and that I made it here. This is just the cherry on top to be here in this stadium. It’s crazy.” Osaka returned to the Arthur Ashe Stadium where she captured her first Grand Slam title with an upset of Serena Williams in 2018 in style — stepping on court in a made-for-the-lights black version of her custom Nike US Open kit. She made a confident start, but she couldn’t convert an early break point and there were too many miscues in the face of devastating pressure from Muchova at the net. The Czech broke for a 4-3 lead in the first as she put together a run of five straight games. Osaka stopped the rot with a steely hold for 1-1 in the second set and broke Muchova for a 5-4 lead in the second. But she wasted three set points in the next game as Muchova regained the break, leveling the set when Osaka smashed a forehand long. Osaka had a 4-2 lead in the tiebreaker when her fourth double fault opened the door. Muchova won four straight points to give herself a pair of match points, Osaka saving one before she banged another wild forehand long.",
