    "title": "Why Customer Testimonials Are Your Ecommerce Superpower",
    "text": "In the digital age, with so many market choices available, even the most robust marketing campaigns can get lost. But one voice really stands out: your customers’.\nReviews and testimonials have become the pillars of brand perception and purchase decisions, especially in the realm of ecommerce. Harnessing this power is not just about showcasing past successes; it’s about amplifying a persuasive authenticity that speaks to the hearts and minds of potential buyers.\nDiscover why customer testimonials are your ecommerce superpower and how to leverage them to drive conversions, loyalty, and brand credibility.\nWhat Are Testimonials?\nCustomer testimonials are reviews or feedback from satisfied customers highlighting their positive experience with a product, service, or brand. They can be in the form of written statements, video recordings, social media posts, or ratings on review platforms.\nTypes of Customer Testimonials\nThere are several types of customer testimonials that you can leverage for your ecommerce business:\n- Text-based testimonials: These are written statements from customers highlighting their positive experience with your brand.\n- Video testimonials: These are recorded videos of satisfied customers talking about their experience with your brand.\n- Social media testimonials: These are posts or comments on social media platforms, such as Instagram or TikTok, from customers who have had a positive experience with your brand.\n- Influencer testimonials: These are endorsements from influencers or celebrities who have used and loved your products/services.\nWhy Are Testimonials Important for Ecommerce?\nBefore we share how to gather and display customer testimonials, it’s crucial to understand why they are so potent.\nThe Power of Social Proof\nCustomer testimonials serve as a form of social proof. In other words, they provide evidence that others have had a positive experience with your product or service. This type of validation is crucial in building trust with potential customers, especially in ecommerce, where physical interactions between buyers and sellers are limited.\nThe Psychology of Persuasion\nThe psychology behind testimonials and reviews is simple yet compelling: humans are inherently social creatures, and as such, we are heavily influenced by social proof.\nWhen we see others making choices and being vocal about their experiences, our brains naturally incline toward that same option. But it goes even deeper. We’re hardwired to seek validation from others. Testimonials offer precisely that — a form of validation that your product or service is worth the customer’s time and money.\nTrust and Credibility — Not Just Buzzwords\nEvery business owner knows the importance of trust and credibility, yet these attributes truly hold substance when experienced and verified by others.\nTestimonials are a way to humanize your brand, injecting real stories and faces into what might otherwise be a faceless online transaction.\nTransparently sharing your customers’ experiences — positive or negative — builds credibility, empathy, and connection, the cornerstones of enduring customer relationships.\nHow to Use Testimonials in Your Marketing Strategy\nNow that we’ve established the power of customer testimonials, it’s time to delve into how you can effectively incorporate them into your marketing strategy.\nGather Testimonials Regularly\nMake sure to gather testimonials from your customers regularly. This can be done through post-purchase surveys, email requests, or even social media shoutouts. It’s essential to have a steady stream of fresh testimonials to showcase on your website and social media platforms.\nCheck out the article below for an overview of collecting customer testimonials via email, interviews, and customer feedback software.\nEcwid sellers can automate the collection of customer testimonials via email or various apps. This way, you can regularly gather reviews without much effort.\nUse Testimonials Throughout Your Website\nDon’t limit testimonials to a designated testimonials page. Incorporate them throughout your website, especially on product pages where they can serve as powerful sales tools for potential customers.\nTestimonials proudly displayed on your site’s homepage, product pages, and checkout process can nudge the wavering customer to the confirm purchase button.\nIf you created your ecommerce website with Ecwid, you can easily add testimonials to your site using pre-made design blocks. There are several layouts and styles to choose from, making it easy to display customer reviews in an attractive manner.\nPlace Testimonials Strategically\nStrategically positioning testimonials, such as aligning them with related products or accentuating them with visuals, guarantees they capture attention effectively.\nAdditionally, consider using testimonials that mention specific product features or benefits you want to highlight. This can help potential customers understand the value of your products and services more clearly.\nLeverage Testimonials in Your Social Media Strategy\nSocial media platforms offer a great opportunity to showcase customer testimonials. Share screenshots of positive reviews or re-post influencer endorsements on your brand’s social media handles. You can even create a dedicated hashtag for customers to share their experiences and feature those testimonials on your social media feed.\nAdd Testimonials to Newsletters and Email Campaigns\nIf you send newsletters or email campaigns to your customer base, consider featuring testimonials. This not only adds credibility to your brand but also serves as a reminder for happy customers to share their experiences with others.\nBe smart with testimonial placement. For example, you can add them to abandoned cart emails to remind potential customers of the positive experiences others have had with your products.\nAdding testimonials to non-promotional newsletters like industry news or tips can also be a subtle yet effective way to showcase social proof. For example, if you own a hair care brand and regularly send out newsletters with hair care tips, you can add a testimonial from a satisfied customer at the end of the email.\nHow to Get Customer Testimonials\nGreat, heartfelt testimonials don’t just land in your lap; they require a strategic approach to gathering and curation that respects your customer’s time and effort while making the review process seamless. Consider:\nMaking It Easy for Your Customers\nA hassle-free, enjoyable customer experience doesn’t end at the sale. You want the process of leaving a review to be as convenient as possible. Tools like post-purchase emails with direct review links or in-line forms on your website expedite the process and show that you value your customers’ feedback.\nIf you’d like to automate the process of collecting and displaying customer testimonials, check out our list of top 10 customer reviews and testimonials tools.\nIncentivizing Without Coercion\nIncentives can motivate customers to leave a review, but be careful not to cross the line into coercion. The goal is to reward and thank your customers, not to buy their opinions. Keep the value of the incentive modest and focus on appreciating their willingness to share their story.\nHow to Ask Customers for Testimonials to Get a Perfect One\nLet’s compare two testimonials:\nGeneric testimonial: I love this product!\nSpecific testimonial: This product has completely transformed my daily routine. I struggled with dry skin, but since using this product, my skin has become softer and more hydrated than ever before.\nGeneric reviews might be nice, but they don’t have much impact on your brand. Here’s how to ask for testimonials that are specific and impactful:\nReach Out to Your Most Loyal Customers\nYour most loyal customers are the ones who have the most positive experiences with your brand. Reach out to them personally and ask for a testimonial. Not only will they be more likely to provide one, but their words will also carry more weight with potential customers.\nPro Tip: Identify your most loyal customers using the\nCustomers page in Ecwid. Just filter customers by order count or total order value.\nEncourage Specificity\nWhen asking customers to leave a review, prompt them with specific questions about their experience with your product or service. This will help guide them in writing a detailed and meaningful testimonial.\nFor example, you can ask, How has our product/service improved your life/business? or What problem were you able to solve with our product?\nIt helps ask customers to address common doubts when considering buying your product. For example, if your product is on the pricier side, you could ask, How has our product’s quality justified its price for you?\nUse the Relevant Language\nWhen asking for a testimonial, use keywords and language you wish to mirror in your customer testimonials. Try to integrate typical terms and phrases your customers use when discussing your products.\nIt might be easier to show customers some examples of testimonials from other shoppers. This will give them a better idea of the kind of feedback you’re looking for and make the process smoother.\nDefine the Structure\nProvide a framework for your customers to follow when leaving a review. This could be in the form of a template or bullet points outlining what you would like them to touch on in their testimonial. It ensures they cover all the key points and helps create consistency among reviews.\nAlso, don’t forget to mention photos or videos as part of the review process, if applicable. Visual testimonials can add an extra layer of authenticity and impact to your marketing strategy.\nMaximize Testimonials Success\nIn a world of endless choices, your past customers are your most vocal advocates. Harnessing the power of their words is more than a marketing best practice — it’s a commitment to honesty, transparency, and a remarkable customer experience.\nWith the strategies we’ve outlined, you’re well on your way to unlocking the full potential of customer testimonials and driving the growth of your ecommerce business.\nIf you’re looking for an ecommerce platform that makes every aspect of selling online easier, consider Ecwid by Lightspeed.

    "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — In the wake of devastating floods that claimed the lives of at least 36 children, grief counselors at Elijah’s Place in Beaumont are offering support and guidance to families struggling with how to talk about loss, especially with their kids.\nAmong the victims was 8-year-old Mary Grace Baker, a student at St. Anne Catholic School in Beaumont. She was attending Camp Mystic in the Hill Country when the flood struck.\n“I cannot begin to imagine the terror that they might have felt at that moment,” said Christian Umana, a counselor at Elijah’s Place. “Because nobody knew what’s going to happen, if they were going to survive.”\nElijah’s Place, a program of Catholic Charities of Southeast Texas, provides grief support for families with children who have experienced the death of a parent or sibling. In light of recent events, the organization is expanding its outreach to help families affected by the Hill Country tragedy.\nProgram Director Randi Fertitta said it’s crucial for parents to let children lead the conversation when discussing traumatic events like the flood.\n“It’s important for parents to first talk to them about what do they know about the event, about what happened to Mary Grace,” Fertitta said.\nShe emphasized that honesty is essential when responding to children’s questions. “By offering them the information they need, it keeps the children from conjuring up their own ideas,” she said.\nFertitta also encouraged parents to be aware of signs of grief in their children, which may include physical complaints, changes in behavior, or trouble sleeping.\nElijah’s Place uses play therapy to help children express emotions they may not have the words to describe. “Play is their language,” said Umana. “Some kids don’t have the ability to comprehend what’s going on with them, so we use play for them to express what they can’t express with language.”\nWhile the nonprofit has reached out to victims' families and local schools to offer help, and is even prepared to host a dedicated support group, so far no one has accepted their offer.\nStill, Umana urged families to seek help if they need it. “You don’t have to deal with this alone. We’re here and we’re open to help you in any way that we can,” he said.\nIf you are looking for help, Fertitta says people can email her at Rfertitta@ccsetx.org or visit their website here.\nIn addition to local resources, an Austin-based organization called Connected Family Partners is hosting a free online webinar to help guide parents and caregivers through difficult conversations with children. The virtual event begins at 9:30 a.m. and will include tips, sample scripts, and a live Q&A session.\nTo register, you can fill out this form.",

    "text": "Melissa Lucio es considerada la única mujer hispana en ser sentenciada a la pena capital en el estado de Texas, Estados Unidos, medida que fue restablecida en 1976 en el estado sureño. Lucio está siendo acusada de golpear y torturar a su hija de 2 años hasta provocarle la muerte, en 2007. El Tribunal de Apelaciones de Texas detuvo la ejecución dos días antes que se lleve a cabo, por lo que el caso podría dar un giro inesperado. ¿Qué sucedió en el caso Melissa Lucio, en el 2007? El 17 de febrero de 2007, la policía respondió al llamado de la familia Alvarez-Lucio y encontró a la niña con hematomas en el cuerpo e inconsciente en la casa. Asimismo, tenía uno de los brazos rotos, por lo que fue trasladada al hospital más cercano, donde se declaró su muerte. El médico forense que evaluó el caso señaló que Mariah Alvarez era una “niña maltratada” que murió por un traumatismo craneoencefálico. Por su parte, los médicos de urgencias que intentaron reanimar a la menor declararon que era el “peor caso” de maltrato infantil que vieron. Según en petición de clemencia presentada antes de la ejecución, Lucio relató detalles del fatídico día. En la mañana del 15 de febrero, Melissa se levantó temprano para preparar a sus hijos rumbo al colegio y empacar sus cosas porque la familia estaba en un proceso de mudanza. Mientras la madre estaba ocupada, Mariah abrió una puerta que daba al exterior y cayó por un tramo de escaleras “empinadas” que constaban con más de una docena de peldaños. Lucio se dio cuenta casi de inmediato de la desaparición de Mariah y la encontró afuera, llorando. Aunque su labio sangraba, no parecía estar gravemente herida. Sin embargo, según informa CNN, la apariencia de la niña resultó engañosa, ya que había sufrido lesiones internas que finalmente le causarían la muerte. Dos días después, Mariah moriría.

El malentendido que podría salvar a Melissa Lucio En el lugar del incidente, Lucio informó a los paramédicos que Mariah se había caído por las escaleras días antes, pero uno de los socorristas expresó dudas, según lo descrito en la petición de clemencia, ya que la residencia era de un solo piso con unos pocos escalones en el frente. No entendió, de acuerdo a lo expuesto en la petición, que la niña se había caído en la casa anterior de la familia. Este malentendido crucial desencadenó una investigación sesgada, afirma la petición de Lucio, en la cual los investigadores asumieron constantemente lo peor sobre Melissa sin investigar ni considerar otras posibilidades. Melissa Lucio, quien ahora tiene 53 años, fue condenada en gran parte, según sus abogados, debido a una “confesión” forzada que proporcionó a las autoridades durante un interrogatorio “agresivo”, llevado a cabo esa misma noche en que falleció su hija.

Según recogió NBC News, estuvo sin permitirle comer, beber o dormir. “La fastidiaron y la regañaron y le gritaron hasta que finalmente accedió a sus demandas y a la insistencia de que era culpable de hacerle daño a su hija”, señaló Sandra Babcock, abogada a una entrevista con BBC Mundo. A pesar de la presión de los agentes, durante el interrogatorio, la madre negó hasta en más de 80 ocasiones distintas haber asesinado a su hija. John, el hijo mayor de Melissa, es quien se encarga de la defensa de su madre. Foto: BBC News.News Related - Con Boca Juniors y ADT: ¿cuáles son los equipos clasificados a la Copa Sudamericana 2024?

    "text": "By Lara Williams\nAt first, it seemed like a 28 square-meter plot of Arborio rice in Italy was a symbol of changing attitudes toward genetically engineered food. Instead, it’s shown us that the debate is well and truly alive.\n Scientists used CRISPR-Cas9, a precision gene-editing technique, to create a variety of risotto rice potentially resistant to Pyricularia oryzae, a pathogenic fungus which leads to rice blast disease. Italy’s first outdoor experiment of the crop was launched in mid-May after rules were loosened to allow such a study, but disaster struck on June 21, when scientists arrived to find most of the plants torn up or mown down. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp\nSome of the rice has begun to recover after being replanted, but lead scientist Vittoria Brambilla has said that the experiment has now “lost its scientific value.” Nobody has taken responsibility for the vandalism, but the message is clear: Genetic engineering remains extremely contentious in Europe.\nThis matters because resistance to food altered by biotechnology is holding back development of new crops that may improve our health or help us mitigate and adapt to climate change.\nTake the example of Golden Rice, a genetically modified organism (GMO) developed in the 1990s to combat vitamin A deficiency. The World Health Organization estimates that the deficiency causes between 250,000 and 500,000 young children to go blind every year, and half of them die within 12 months of losing their sight. The Philippines was the first country to approve the commercial cultivation of the crop, but earlier this year, campaigns by Greenpeace, which argued that the rice hadn’t been shown to be safe, convinced the court of appeal to revoke that approval. All the evidence from multiple toxicity and allergenicity studies points to the plant being safe — a lifesaver, in fact — and it has gained approval from multiple countries for safe consumption, including the US, New Zealand and Australia. Yet unfounded fears continue to stymie its rollout: It’s still not grown commercially in any nation.

Developed by laboratory Norfolk Plant Sciences, the GMO tomato contains antioxidants called anthocyanins, which are healthy antioxidants found in blueberries, blackberries and aubergines. By selling direct to gardeners, the scientists hope to change perceptions around GM foods.\nGenetic alterations have come a long way. We arguably began doing it thousands of years ago, when we started selectively breeding crops for size, yield, taste and resilience. In the 1980s, transgenic plants or GMOs, where genes from another species are inserted into the genome, were created. This is the technology which gave rise to the term “frankenfood,” though it’s not as unnatural as it sounds. A 2015 study found evidence that modern sweet potatoes are the product of a similar gene transfer that happened naturally thousands of years ago. There have been hundreds of studies examining various ways in which GMOs could have negative effects on our health — such as increased cancer risk, toxicity buildup and allergic reactions — and no links have been found. (One infamous study by scientist Arpad Pusztai claimed that rats fed on GM potatoes had worse health outcomes, but a scientific audit panel found the experiment to be seriously “flawed in many aspects of design, execution and analysis.”)\nNowadays, new genomic techniques such as CRISPR allow changes to be made directly to the genome without parachuting in DNA from elsewhere. Regulation of these so-called gene-edited crops varies country to country. The US, for example, has deregulated them as they don’t contain any foreign DNA. Europe, on the other hand, currently applies the same stringent regulations to CRISPR crops as to traditional GMOs — but proposed new rules would make it much easier for certain edited plants to come to market. That’s something to celebrate. The European Parliament voted to approve the draft legislation in February, but discussions at the European Council have reached a deadlock.\nGene-edited seeds could also aid agriculture as climate change leads to more droughts, floods, pests and diseases.\nFor instance, insect-resistant crop varieties have been shown to greatly reduce the need for chemical applications, therefore shrinking the number of pesticide poisoning among farm workers. A 2013 study showed that adoption of insect-resistant cotton reduced food insecurity within Indian farm households by 15 per cent-20 per cent. Scientists have also developed drought-tolerant wheat in Argentina, while Kenya has begun growing drought-tolerant maize.\nIt could even help broaden the uptake of regenerative farming — an approach to agriculture that focuses on improving the soil and environment. Giles Oldroyd, professor of crop science at the University of Cambridge and director of the Crop Science Center, is leading a team using GM and gene-editing to engineer cereal crops that can take advantage of symbiotic relationships with microorganisms in order to better absorb nutrients, just like legumes can. This would enable a vast reduction in the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which are responsible for about 5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nThose opposed to agricultural biotechnology often cite health concerns, although decades of research has not found any negative impacts of eating GMOs. The most convincing criticism is that only a small proportion of GMOs thus far would deal with concerns related to the climate and instead have been developed by the Big Four of the seed industry — Bayer AG’s Monsanto unit, Corteva Agriscience, China National Chemical Corp.’s (ChemChina) Sygenta and BASF SE — to strengthen their own market power.\nFor example, herbicide-tolerant crops are one of the most common GM traits, developed by the likes of Bayer to be used alongside chemicals that they also produce. This encourages intensive farming, while increasing expenses for farmers who have to buy patented seeds and herbicide.\nThis isn’t an issue with the technology itself, but with its application. Oldroyd told me that the high regulatory hurdles required to bring a GM crop to market is one of the reasons behind this — only the big multinational companies have the resources to do so, and they have no interest in creating plants which require fewer inputs.\nWe shouldn’t do away with safety checks where they’re required, but the UK’s Royal Society, the oldest scientific academy in the world, recommends an outcomes-based approach similar to the US model, which looks at the scientifically plausible risks of new crops on a case-by-case basis and balances the costs of using the method against any hypothetical costs of not using it.\nThe EU’s bill reducing the regulation for crops edited with new genomic techniques will be a step in the right direction, though the role of patenting needs to be examined closely. Cheaper market access will open the door to innovative seeds from sustainably minded research institutions. Given that the EU’s stringent rules on GMOs have been credited with influencing regulation in developing countries, it could also help regulatory progress in those places too.\nActivists such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth often pitch organic farming as the only sustainable alternative to conventional, high-tech agriculture. But embracing technology can add resilience to our food systems and support a radically different regenerative system — if only we have the vision and political will.",
