    "text": "ARKANSAS, USA — Starting on Sunday, 5COUNTRY is expected to start enduring a days-long bout of winter weather. \"It's gonna be a long, tough stretch for three or four days, but we're in good shape overall,\" Arkansas Department of Transportation ( [ARDOT](https://www.ardot.gov/)) spokesperson Dave Parker said. With so many storms moving into the area, the personnel keeping roads ice-free become the unsung heroes. \"They will all be working 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. kind of shifts, starting Saturday, Sunday, of course, Monday would normally be a holiday, but not for us,\" Parker added. \"So they're ready. I think it's a mental thing. As long as you know what's ahead of you in some way you can prepare for it.\" Benton County leaders say they are prepping their crews and vehicles now to be ready for long shifts as well. Melody Kwok, the director of communications for Benton County says that crews are working around the clock to ensure safe roads. \"We are preparing to have overnight crews to help our emergency responders and help clear any significant accumulation that we get overnight as well as having our day crews will post 12-hour shifts,\" Kwok said. Washington County leaders say they normally don't pre-treat the roads because of the difficult terrain but they will this time around because Sunday's winter storm could make the roads dangerous to drive on. \"We have a county with a very diverse topography. And so there's a lot of places where we understand there's a lot of inclines a lot of hills that give people a lot of trouble. And so that's what we're going to look at what this is of in,\" Washington County Judge Patrick Deakins said. While drivers are encouraged to stay off the roads during difficult conditions, those that do have to be on the road should look out for fallen trees or powerlines on the roads from high winds. \"Please stay in your car, stay away from those alert emergency services that you have found that power line being down so that people can respond to get that cleaned up,\" Judge Deakins added. All officials say in any emergency, it's safest to stay in your car until emergency responders can reach you. They also advise drivers have emergency preparedness kits and blankets, food, and water in their cars.",

    "text": "Leading conservative and pro-life voices raised a ruckus over the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) lack of a more explicit preborn defense in its party platform. And they’re understandably dismayed; it’s the first time in almost 40 years that this kind of language was excluded from the GOP’s vision statement. However, when you consider the electoral landscape, one thing becomes clear: the RNC and the Trump campaign are playing the long game.\nIn poker, the world’s best players don’t play their hands; they play the person across the table. Their adversary, whether they know it or not, will give clues as to whether they’re holding a winning hand or a whole lot of nothing.\nThe Democrats flash their cards at every opportunity: they’re all in on abortion . The Harris campaign has no other cards to play – the economy is in shambles, our southern border is a mess, and the world is on fire. This is where the focus of the GOP Platform seems to be – and maybe rightly so.\nLike any smart poker player, the Trump campaign and the RNC are not getting baited into playing their opponent’s hand.\nPlease follow LifeNews on Rumble for the latest pro-life videos.\nYet, this real-politick approach doesn’t change the fact that abortion is the biggest human rights issue of our day. Recent and unfortunate comments by the Donald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, compared America’s problems to a crumbling house, likening abortion to a “spot on the wall in the basement.”\nAbortion isn’t just a dent in the crown molding – it’s an entire basement, main floor, and attic packed to the brim with the corpses of dead children. In other words, over 65 million dead babies in 50 years and counting.\nIn this election, Republicans can’t ignore the issue outright – they need to bravely and boldly call out the extreme and limitless abortion on demand policies of the Democrats . It’s not only morally right – it’s politically smart. The Democrats are wildly out of step with what ordinary Americans want – especially among the all too critical voting bloc for the Democrats, the Youth Vote.\nA Demetree Institute for Pro-Life Advancement 2024 YouGov Poll showed that only 9 percent of young voters supported the Democratic Party’s radical agenda of abortion through all nine months without limits, up to and including infanticide.\nHowever, there’s a creeping narrative that the absence of strong party platform language on preborn lives would mean a future Trump Administration would refuse to stand up and defend preborn lives in law and service\nBut there are far more reasons to be hopeful than worried.\nThe Republican Party’s new platform has explicit language around the 14th Amendment’s role in protecting ALL LIFE. When it was revealed, Students for Life Action (SFLAction) issued a statement , saying “the most significant contribution that the GOP platform makes for LIFE comes in celebrating the fact that the 14th Amendment ‘guarantees’ legal protection for the preborn.”\nFor two years, Students for Life of America (SFLA) has championed and pushed for that exact reality . With Roe  gone, the human rights of all Americans – born and preborn – should be anchored again in the 14th Amendment. This is a victory.\nAlso, during Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance’s acceptance speech , the Vice President hopeful said, “Social conservatives have a seat at this table, and they always will so long as I have any influence in this party and President Trump, I know, agrees.” Vance’s own rags to riches story stands as a rebuke to the oft-said arguments for abortion: that the economically poor should kill their children if they can’t take care of them.\nEven though the Republican Party has been home to pro-life voters for almost a generation, more needs to be done to show they are still welcome . Ensuring abortion is unthinkable in our lifetime is a marathon, not a sprint. The beginning of the fight was destroying Roe v. Wade , and preborn lives still matter to our GOP friends – and that there are pro-life champions who will join the future Trump administration.\nWhat is absolutely certain, however, is that preborn lives are at far greater risk without having former President Trump in the White House.\nThe Biden-Harris administration is the most radically pro-abortion presidency in history with other extremists waiting in the wings. A potential second term with President Harris at the helm would be even more unhinged; Democrats would try to pack the U.S. Supreme Court, get rid of the filibuster, and codify something far worse than Roe v. Wade as law of the land again, ensuring limitless abortion from coast to coast.\nThe Democrats are increasingly desperate, replacing their own candidate at the eleventh hour, and frantically visiting swing states on an abortion apologetics tour. They’re holding a bad hand and are running low on chips.\nWhile there’s every reason to feel confident and hopeful about our odds, there’s still a risk of creating divisions and disenfranchising the conservative, pro-life voting base that is needed to win in November.\nThe pro-life movement is holding a winning hand – but even that can become a losing one if it’s played poorly.\nLifeNews Note: Mattison Brooks is the Online Editor at Students for Life of America.

    "title": "Energy News Roundup: Kwik Trip goes electric as federal funds flow in",
    "text": "Midwestern convenience store giant Kwik Trip is breaking into the charging business. The chain, known for its gas and grocery offerings, will install electric vehicle chargers at “a strategic number of its stores” through its new Kwik Charge program. The announcement comes a few months after Kwik Trip received about $23 million in federal funds aimed at establishing a statewide EV charging network in Wisconsin. At least four Kwik Trip locations are expected to have functioning chargers by the end of the year.\nMore federal funds to support EVs are on their way to Michigan. This round of federal funding commits $355 million to four battery-oriented companies , with $145 million going to an initiative to extract critical minerals from battery waste and the remaining $210 million split across three battery component manufacturing projects. It’s the latest in a string of federal investments in the state’s auto industry and nascent clean energy manufacturing sector.\nThe controversial power line that crosses a national wildlife refuge along its route from Iowa to Wisconsin is now complete. Though still ensnared in legal battles, the roughly $675 million transmission project went online on Thursday . Conservation groups tried to block the 102-mile line, including by challenging a land swap that allowed it to cross the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge. Delays caused by the lawsuits contributed to the project’s higher-than-planned cost, according to the utilities that built it.\nIt’s full steam ahead for the planned restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. Federal officials announced this week that they have finalized a $1.52 billion loan to help the shuttered reactor reopen. Regulators expect to decide whether to allow the restart — a first for a U.S. nuclear plant — by mid-2025. Palisades is still on schedule to be back in operation at this time next year , according to its owner, Holtec International, though others have said that timeline may be too ambitious . One Department of Energy official told reporters that the recommissioning will take “a couple of years.”\nBut as Midwestern states capitalize on federal funds meant to help them profit from the energy transition, much of the region is missing out on aid for aging hydropower dams . The $30 million for dam safety and $63 million for hydropower upgrades that the Midwest is set to receive this year, adds up to significantly less than what’s going to the South, Northeast or West. While the Midwest tends to have smaller dams with fewer people living downstream, officials have said these states don’t always have the funds to make the improvements their dams need.\nMore energy news, in case you missed it:\nPlans for a plant in Wisconsin that would make hemp-based batteries are in limbo after the startup behind the project failed to secure a $50 million federal grant . General Motors unveiled plans last month for a project in Detroit that would be the company’s first hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing plant. A pair of companies in Northeast Ohio will use federal money to install 73 chargers in the Cleveland area by the end of this year. Indianapolis International Airport intends to install a nearly $47 million solar canopy over its parking lot. At Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, an ongoing terminal expansion will include geothermal heating and other green building systems .",
