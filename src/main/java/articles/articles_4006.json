    "text": "EDMONTON — Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says her government will introduce legislation on pronouns in schools after classes begin in September. Smith said the new policy requiring parents to consent before children under 16 can change their names or pronouns in schools will be proposed in the fall legislature session that begins in late October. \"I don't want to presuppose what the outcome of those deliberations would be, but there will be lots of time to be able to get the policies in place and to implement them, so we have to make sure we have that robust discussion,\" Smith told an unrelated news conference on Thursday. Her comments come about three weeks before most kindergarten to Grade 12 schools open their classrooms. Smith said she intends to bring legislation forward for a suite of policies she first announced in January. Those include restricting transgender youth access to gender-affirming health care, banning transgender participation in female sports, and requiring parental consent or notification on sex education and changes to pronouns and names in schools. \"Once you've passed legislation, regulations have to be implemented,\" said Smith, who did not offer specifics about what enforcement would look like. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups Egale Canada and Skipping Stone Foundation have said if Alberta moves ahead with the proposed changes, they would bring legal action. Before Smith spoke on Thursday, the province’s two largest school divisions -- the Edmonton Public School Board and the Calgary Board of Education -- said they weren’t clear on what the province will implement and when those changes would arrive. On Wednesday, Alberta Teachers’ Association president Jason Schilling told The Canadian Press that his colleagues are incredibly worried about a chilling effect of new pronoun rules, even if the policy remains in limbo. \"It does definitely have a bit of a dark cloud hanging over things,\" he said, noting many teachers worry about being put in the position of having to decide whether to violate the trust and confidence of a student. \"They don't want to jeopardize the safety of a student who might trust them enough to share the struggles that they're going through,\" said Schilling. The issue has raised questions over whether Smith’s government would ultimately follow in the footsteps of Saskatchewan's government. Saskatchewan invoked the rarely used notwithstanding clause to override sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Saskatchewan's Human Rights Code for its pronoun legislation last fall. Schilling said if the Alberta premier did that, it would be \"a sledgehammer approach,\" and tone deaf. More pressing worries for teachers are a lack of educational assistants, and ballooning class sizes, he said. Critics have called Smith's moves an act of appeasement to her far-right United Conservative Party base ahead of a leadership review in early November, but Smith has said the issue of \"parental rights\" is important to her government. She has said she believes there’s nothing wrong with parents wanting to protect their \"child’s innocence as long as possible on issues of sexuality.\" Following Smith's announcement Thursday, Kristopher Wells, a Canada Research Chair for the public understanding of sexual and gender minority youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, wrote on social media that the premier's \"obsession\" with the transgender community is \"beyond weird.\" \"The fact that she ignores our crumbling health-care system to obsess over what parts people have in their pants is deeply disturbing. This trans panic she is manufacturing is hateful, hurtful and needs to stop,\" Wells wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Saskatchewan passed a law in October preventing children under 16 from changing their names or pronouns at school without parental consent. Dozens of teachers signed an online petition calling on school divisions not to follow the law. The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission has said invoking the notwithstanding clause significantly affects the rights of minors. Heather Kuttai, a former Saskatchewan human rights commissioner, resigned over the legislation, saying it assaults the rights of gender-diverse children. A report from Saskatchewan's child advocate said it violates rights to gender identity and expression. — With files from Jeremy Simes in Regina This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.

    "text": "New Delhi, March 7Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today said the armed forces were equipped, capable and ready to give a befitting reply to anyone \"who casts an evil eye on India\". He said in the sphere of defence equipment manufacturing, the aim was to export equipment worth Rs 50,000 crore in five years from now.\nHe said the defence personnel had a strong willpower due to a powerful leadership at the Centre. \"We are working towards keeping the morale of the soldiers high,\" he said. \"India&apos;s defence apparatus is today stronger than ever as the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is focusing on bolstering it with the sentiment of Indianness,\" he said.\nRajnath was speaking at an event. He termed \"perspective\" as the major difference between the current and the previous dispensations, stating that the present government ardently believed in the capabilities of the people, while those in power earlier were somewhat sceptical about their potential.\nHighlighting the positive impact on the defence sector due to these decisions, Rajnath said: \"The annual defence production, which was around Rs 40,000 crore in 2014, has now crossed a record Rs 1.10 lakh crore.\"\n\"Exports of defence equipment today have touched Rs 16,000 crore from a meagre Rs 1,000 crore around 10 years ago. We have set a target to achieve Rs 50,000 crore of exports by 2028-29,\" he said.\nThe minister said when it came to technology, developing countries had two options - innovation and imitation - and the Modi government was laying special emphasis on making the country a technology creator rather than a follower.\nIn a veiled dig at China that is often accused by the US and Russia of stealing technology, Rajnath said, \"Imitating technology from developed countries is not wrong for those whose innovation capacity and human resource have not reached the level required to produce new technologies. If a country imitates technology from other nations, it still moves ahead from old technology; however, the problem is that one becomes addicted to imitation and gets used to second-class technology.\"",
