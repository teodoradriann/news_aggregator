    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's professional baseball league cancelled a scheduled game on Friday due to high temperatures, the first time in the league's 42-year history that it invoked a provision that allows for a game cancellation due to extreme heat.\nThe game between LG Twins and Lotte Giants was scheduled to start at 6:30 p.m. (0930 GMT) local time in the southeastern city of Ulsan, where the daily high temperatures exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for a second straight day on Friday.\nA Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) official said Friday's heat warning cancellation was the first since the league was launched in 1982. Ground temperatures in the Ulsan stadium were higher than 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) at times during the day, he said.\nSouth Korea is under heat warnings for all of the country, a week after the end of the annual monsoon season when heavy rains pounded mostly the central regions causing flooding and landslides.\nSouth Korea is in a temperate zone in the northern hemisphere with four distinct seasons, but the climate is seen to be getting warmer, according to experts and officials who cited annual average temperatures.\nSeveral regions of the country have been under daily heat warnings since July 21, issued by the meteorological agency when daily high temperatures exceed 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit).\n(Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Sharon Singleton)\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",

    "title": "The PlayStation 5 has gone up in price and the Japanese decide to switch to Xbox",
    "text": "Even though this price increase won’t take effect until next week, users have decided to cut their losses and switch to Xbox , since, after the announcement, the available stock of the PS5 sold out quickly before the new price was applied.\nXbox Series X sales soar in Japan Automaton has contacted one of Japan’s largest retailers, who claims that sales have skyrocketed Xbox Series X sales placing itself in the Top 8 of sales, when until now it had not dropped below the Top 100. Due to the increase in sales of Xbox Series X, it has run out of stock.\nThe motivation for many Japanese users to buy the PS5 is due to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds a highly anticipated title in the country that will finally not be exclusive to PS5 as initially reported, as it will also be available for PC and Xbox.\nMicrosoft has been working hard to make a name for itself in Japan for itself, and in recent years, with the launch of the Xbox Series S and Series X, it has succeeded. Thanks to Sony , it seems to have become the best option in the Japanese market.\nIt’s now a matter of time to see if Xbox Series X sales continue to increase or if, on the contrary, this is a one-off movement due to the price increase of the PS5 and the lack of stock due to the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom’s latest title expected for early 2025.\nIt will affect PS5 Pro sales The PS5 price increase in Japan comes at a bad time for the company, as, according to the latest news, the intergenerational renewal, the PS5 Pro will be presented at the PlayStation Showcase which is celebrated at the beginning of September, specifically on the 9th.\nIf the 90 euro increase seemed excessive to users in Japan, the outlook for the PS5 Pro is very bleak, as it will be more expensive, justified by the improvements it will offer.\nThis console will represent a significant change in terms of performance compared to the original console released in 2020. In addition, it will include twice as much storage space. So many improvements will be reflected in the price, a price that, according to various sources, could rise to 700 euros in exchange, becoming Sony’s most expensive PlayStation.\nOnce it hits the market, we’ll know if users consider it worth paying more to enjoy a higher resolution or if, on the contrary, the features offered by current hardware are more than enough.",

    "title": "The second coming of Doug Wilson",
    "text": "(RNS) — Last month, onetime Fox News host Tucker Carlson sat in his cabin-like studio and introduced a bearded, 70-year-old Idaho pastor named Doug Wilson as the person “most closely identified” with Christian nationalism, calling him one of the “rare” clergy “willing to engage on questions of culture and politics.” The vibe was similarly effusive weeks later, when Charlie Kirk, founder of the youth-focused conservative group Turning Point USA, had Wilson on his podcast to define Christian nationalism for listeners, calling the Reformed pastor a “thoughtful, brilliant thinker.”\nKirk was so excited by the interview that he encouraged listeners to “send it to your pastors.”\nFrom talk shows to the conference circuit, Wilson, the influential head of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, for decades, has become a regular voice in conservative political circles, emerging as a figurehead for what is framed as a comparatively moderate version of Christian nationalism.\nAs far as Wilson is concerned, the media blitz is simply the political world paying attention to ideas he has preached for some time.\n“The reason I think it happened,” Wilson told Religion News Service in an interview last week, is because “we’ve been pounding away at these issues for a number of decades.”\nBut scholars and critics of Wilson argue his version of Christian nationalism remains radical, and as Wilson associates himself with a widening web of right-wing influencers and personalities — including some who argue the U.S. Constitution is “dead” — analysts say they are worried about precisely what kind of ideas the small-town pastor will promote on the national stage.\nWilson’s recent elevation has centered less on his past statements and controversies — of which there are many, from anti-LGBTQ+ slurs to comments decried by critics as pro-slavery to contentious stances on gender roles — and more on his vision for a Christian nation. For example, he has floated incorporating the Apostles Creed into the Constitution; believes building a Christian nation in the U.S. should be a “ pan-Protestant project ”; and has said that while he does not personally endorse the idea of establishing a religion at the state level, he believes it to be legal.\n“As a Christian, I would like that national structure to conform to the thing that God wants, and not the thing that man wants,” Wilson told Carlson. “That’s Christian nationalism.”\nKristin Kobes du Mez, a Calvin University professor whose best-selling book “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation” includes a section on Wilson, said the pastor is “well-positioned for this moment.” Among other reasons, she said, he is part of a “right-wing critique of moderate evangelicals — or essentially of any evangelicals, as some are quite conservative — who are pushing back against extremism, or who are not supporting Trump, or who are not all-in on the Christian nationalist project.”\nIn an interview with RNS last February, Wilson imagined a global order of Christian nations that would exclude any self-described Christian nation that allowed for same-sex marriage or abortion access, saying a “liberal Methodist” nation would be “out” and people who embraced “some total loopy-heresy” would be barred from holding public office.\n“This is a Christian republic, and … you’re not singing off the same sheet of music that we are,” he told RNS at the time. “So, no, you can’t be the mayor.”\nWilson, who engages with Christian nationalism in his new book “ Mere Christendom ,” has framed himself as a more moderate alternative to other self-described Christian nationalists such as Nick Fuentes , who is known for spouting extremist rhetoric, including antisemitism.\n“If Nick Fuentes successfully got himself appointed the king of the Christian nationalists, then I’m not a Christian nationalist anymore,” Wilson told RNS. He added that he wants to use his status as a kind of “spokesman for Christian nationalism” to “take the opportunity at the appropriate time to say, well, the one thing to understand about a bunch of us Christian nationalists is how much we love the Jews.”\nElizabeth Neumann, an expert on extremism who served in former President Donald Trump’s administration before resigning in protest in 2020, said she was encouraged by Wilson — or any pastor — pushing back against antisemitism. But Neumann, who was raised evangelical and said she was once a “big subscriber” to the classical Christian education movement Wilson helped popularize, argued the pastor’s efforts to distance himself from Fuentes strikes her as either “naive” or evidence that Wilson is “playing a game.”\nShe pointed to Wilson’s appearances with Andrew Isker, a Minnesota pastor who graduated from the ministry program associated with Wilson’s church. In 2022, Wilson blurbed a book on Christian nationalism that Isker co-authored with Andrew Torba, the founder of the far-right alternative social media website Gab, who spoke at a conference organized by Fuentes in 2021.\nNeumann said “characters” Wilson is associating with “might not have the name Nick Fuentes, but many of them fully subscribe to Nick’s views, or are very happy to be adjacent to Nick Fuentes.”\nWhat’s more, Matthew Taylor, senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies, argued Wilson’s views remain far outside the mainstream, irrespective of his stance on Fuentes. Wilson, he said, “represents a form of Christian supremacy, a very aggressive vision of kind of a Christian retrenchment within American culture.”\n“To have him getting play on these major media platforms signals a lot about where things are headed within kind of conservative and Republican politics today,” Taylor said.\nNevertheless, Wilson’s popularity is rising. He is slated to address Turning Point USA’s Believers Summit in July and the National Conservatism conference that same month, where he is a featured speaker alongside political figures such as Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and J.D. Vance of Ohio, as well as onetime Trump aides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller.\nDu Mez said much of Wilson’s recent modern-day rhetoric echoes his long-standing status as an evangelical outsider. But Du Mez noted a difference this go-round: She was unaware of Wilson previously partnering with so many national political figures, and while Wilson has attracted attention for promoting a local “ spiritual takeover ” of Moscow, “that’s different than taking over the country and turning it all into your enclave.”\n“What we’re seeing among the right wing — in religious spaces, and generally — is, in the wake of 2016, an emboldening posture of, ‘Oh, wait, we can take over. Let’s get serious here,” Du Mez said.\nAsked how he plans to interact with politicos, Wilson said he would not appear at a campaign rally, but “wouldn’t mind” sharing the stage with someone “who happened to be running for office.” And while he insists he does not spend “a ton” of time in dialogue with political figures, he does discuss “policy options” with “people who are politically engaged,” which he said includes political lobbyists.\n“I get a lot of feedback from political operatives who are reading what I write,” Wilson said.\nHow exactly Wilson will fuse his theology with the current political zeitgeist remains to be seen. In the past, he has criticized the 1964 Civil Rights Act, arguing in a 2010 interview that while racism is a “sin,” there “ought not to be a law” forcing a hypothetical renter to “rent to whoever.”\n“Not everything that God disapproves of, and we disapprove of legitimately, ought to be against the law,” he said .\nHis old ideas are already being cited in new ways. Wilson’s 2010 interview was referenced directly in a video published last week by Wade Stotts, who used it to bolster an argument that the U.S. Constitution is “dead” while praising efforts to radically re-order American society. Wilson tweeted out the video by Stotts, who works at Wilson’s own Canon Press , on Saturday.\nNeumann, who recently published the book “ Kingdom of Rage: The Rise of Christian Extremism and the Path Back to Peace, ” said the Constitutional rhetoric was of particular concern, especially given the respect Wilson commands in some circles.\n“When you have a serious Bible teacher … increasingly aligning with people who are clearly focused on a political agenda and co-opting Christianity for their political agenda,” Neumann said, it can — intentionally or otherwise — provide “Christian cover” to “extremist narratives.”\nSpeaking to RNS, Wilson only listed one policy proposal: mandating the inclusion of a “none of the above” option on election ballots, although he wouldn’t check that box himself when voting in this year’s presidential election.\n“I’m not a ‘rah rah’ Trumper,” he said, before adding, “but I am going to vote for him.”\nIn his interview with Carlson, Wilson insisted there was “no political solution” to what he described was a dire moral crisis facing the U.S., calling instead for religious revival — something he has long insisted is the ultimate cure for America’s ills . But in speaking to RNS last week, Wilson clarified that a revival also means reshaping politics itself.\n“There is no political solution, because politics is not a savior. But I do want to hasten to add that politics will be saved,” he said.\n“There’s no way a reformation and revival could occur without having a political impact, or a political transformation.”",

    "text": "Nancy Mace wearing a sling – Photo: Nancy Mace, via X Federal prosecutors are declining to pursue charges against James McIntyre, who was accused of injuring U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) by shaking her hand vigorously at a December reception honoring foster advocates.\nThe 33-year-old McIntyre is a former foster care youth who co-founded the Illinois chapter of Foster Care Alumni of America. He was named “Public Citizen of the Year” by the Illinois chapter of the National Association of Social Workers in 2019 due to his advocacy on behalf of youth in the foster care system.\nMace, one of six co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, delivered a speech praising advocates for foster care youth at a December 10 reception at the Rayburn House Office Building.\nThe reception commemorated the 25th anniversary of the passage of a law that expanded federal support for foster care.\nAfter Mace finished her speech, McIntyre headed to the doorway, where he briefly spoke to Mace and shook her hand.\n“Trans youth are also foster youth, and they need your support,” he allegedly told the congresswoman, according to foster care advocates present at the event.\nThe statement was a reference to the fact that a 2019 study found that approximately 30% of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ, and 5% identify as transgender.\nAfter Mace left the event, one of her aides returned to the reception, asking McIntyre his name and to repeat what he said to Mace.\nMcIntyre left the reception but was summoned back to the Rayburn House Office Building by Capitol Police, who showed up with an “overwhelming presence” to arrest him.\nAs reported by The Hill , Mace claimed McIntyre aggressively shook her arm “in an exaggerated manner” for several seconds while she tried to pull away, injuring her in the process. But the outlet also reported that reception attendees who saw the exchange said the encounter between Mace and McIntyre looked like a “benign handshake.”\nMcIntyre was charged with assaulting a government official. He pleaded not guilty in D.C. Superior Court.\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR FREE WEEKLY MAGAZINE Mace, who introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from women’s bathrooms and other facilities on U.S. Capitol grounds, wrote on X that she had been accosted by a “pro-trans man” due to “my fight to protect women.”\nShe claimed that her injuries were so severe that she needed a wrist brace, and she was seen walking around the Capitol with her arm in a sling.\nAccording to The Washington Post , a single-sentence filing in D.C. Superior Court on April 1 showed that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia would not move forward with prosecuting McIntyre.\nNo reason was given for the decision, and a U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesman declined to comment.\nMace criticized the decision.\n“When a man can physically assault a woman in the halls of Congress, with impunity, it sends an appalling message to every woman in America,” she said through a spokesperson. “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. I was injured, intentionally, and I am still in pain. I filed charges, and they were inexplicably ignored. But I will not be. I will not back down. I will not be intimidated. And I sure as hell won’t stay silent.”\nThe spokesperson added that the congresswoman was not contacted or consulted about the decision to drop the charges.\nMace told Charleston, S.C.-based NBC affiliate WCBD that the foster care advocates who contested her account of the interaction with McIntyre are “lying about what happened.”\nMcIntyre’s attorney, Pierce Suen, of the Georgetown University Law Center, declined to comment on dropped charges.\nA statement issued through Illinois State Rep. Kelly Cassidy — a pro-transgender lesbian — McIntyre is said to be “pleased but not surprised that these baseless charges have been dropped.”\nThe statement also said that Mace’s accusation “demonstrated her desire to criminalize anyone who advocates for the needs of our trans youth” and that the charges more broadly illustrate the Trump administration’s attempts to “criminalize protected speech and create an environment of fear among advocates.”\nSUBSCRIBE OUR FREE WEEKLY MAGAZINE",

Europa Press News via Getty After his arrest, the priest was provisionally released by the investigating judge, the diocese said, expressing its \"pain and dismay at the suffering and scandal\" caused by the events.\nWhile it waits for a \"clarification\" of what happened, the diocese said it felt it was \"appropriate, at this time, to temporarily remove him from the public exercise of the ministry and from his office as parish priest.\"\nThe clergyman has been offered \"psychological and spiritual\" guidance, the statement said.\nOnline newspaper El Español identified the priest as Don Alfonso Raúl Masa Soto, known as Don Alfonso.\nThe newspaper said Alfonso graduated with a degree in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical University. The outlet said he was a parish priest in several towns in Salamanca, and when he was transferred to the parish in Don Benito, residents of Salamanca who admired him started a petition to prevent his transfer.\nEl Pais reported the priest was involved in the trafficking of Viagra and \"other powerful aphrodisiac substances\" along with a second arrested man, whom the reports said was his boyfriend.\nThe two men, who had been under police surveillance for several months, used a home rented by the priest to store the products, according to El Español , which said the news caused \"disbelief\" among the parish's faithful.\nThe priest's lawyer said \"there is no evidence that incriminates\" his client and \"he had no knowledge of anything,\" according to El Mundo .\nAlfonso's arrest comes just days after a pastor in Connecticut was arrested on five charges – including for possession of crystal meth and possession with intent to sell narcotics.",
