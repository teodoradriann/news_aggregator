In this case, we are talking about a AAA-level project.\nIt’s unclear exactly what kind of project Blizzard is preparing, but Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier recently reported that the company is in the incubation stage (that is, very early) of a new shooter based on StarCraft.\nThe small team is allegedly led by former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who moved to Blizzard to work on Project Odyssey. After the cancellation of the survival simulator, the specialist seems to have taken on a new project.\nBlizzard’s two previous attempts to release a shooter based on StarCraft ended unsuccessfully – both the third-person action game StarCraft: Ghost and Ares (a kind of analogue of Battlefield) were eventually canceled.\nIf you notice an error, select it with the mouse and press CTRL+ENTER.",

    "text": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards\nBy Ramishah Maruf, CNN\nNew York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission\n issued several warnings for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death.\nWalmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy.\nEarlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s\nsmall parts cylinder (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.”\nThe agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States.\nThe recall affects about 4,240 units.\nThe CPSC said customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Summary\n- Google is reportedly opening a retail store in Georgetown, Washington DC.\n- The store would be Google's eighth in the US, joining upcoming locations in Austin and Santa Monica.\n- It will showcase Pixel devices, Nest products, Fitbit, and offer repair appointments.\nGoogle is set to open its next physical retail store in Santa Monica next month, but it looks like the company is getting more serious about expanding its retail presence in the US. We already know Google is planning to open a store later this year in Austin, Texas, but now reports suggest the company is gearing up to open its eighth physical store, this time in Washington DC.\nRelated\nLate last year, there were rumors that Google was eyeing a location in Georgetown, Washington DC, to expand its retail footprint. Now, a new report claims that Google has purchased a 7,000-square-foot space at 3235 M St. NW in Georgetown. The company has reportedly signed a 10-year lease with EastBanc, one of the major commercial real estate developers in the area.\nWhile it's unclear how far along the deal is — or even if it's finalized — the fact that Google hasn't updated its Google Stores page suggests it's still in the early stages. We've reached out to Google for a comment but haven't heard back yet.\nGoogle's next retail store might be coming to Washington DC\nIf the reports are accurate, the Georgetown store would be Google's eighth physical retail outlet in the US. The company currently has stores in Chelsea, Williamsburg, Newbury Street, Oakbrook, and one near its Mountain View headquarters, with Austin and Santa Monica stores set to open soon.\nThe new store would allow Washington DC residents to experience Google's products in person, including Pixel phones, tablets, smartwatches, and earbuds. Like other Google Stores, it will likely feature Nest smart home products, Fitbit devices, and official Google merchandise. It would also provide a convenient spot for repair appointments for locals.\nCompared to Apple and Samsung, Google has had a pretty limited retail presence in the US. While Google has just a handful of stores, Apple operates over 270 locations nationwide. But with the potential Georgetown store and other upcoming locations, it's clear that Google is looking to change that.\nRelated\nThe Google Store now sells certified refurbished Pixels at serious discounts\nAnd the latest OS preinstalled",

Estamos felizes pelo que fizemos, sabíamos da dificuldade que tivemos na preparação para o Europeu contra a Croácia e foi importante darmos esta imagem.» «Ronaldo? Ele tem essa capacidade de estar constantemente a melhorar e superar-se a si mesmo, com a experiência dele, acho que provar aos que não gostam dele que continua a fazer estas coisas não é importante. Toda a mentalidade e paixão de jogar pela Seleção Nacional, está de parabéns e acho que ainda vai bater muitos mais recordes. Tenho a esperança que ele esteja no Mundial e acho que ele vai fazer por isso.» «Ganhar a Liga das Nações? Claro que sim, agora temos um jogo difícil (Escócia) e para estar na final temos de o vencer.»",

    "text": "120 Jahre Feuerwehr Poneggen: Fest der Kameradschaft und des Ehrenamtes\nSCHWERTBERG/PONEGGEN. In Poneggen wurde das 120-jährige Bestehen der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr gefeiert. Das dreitägige Fest zog rund 2.300 Besucher an und stand ganz im Zeichen der Dankbarkeit, Kameradschaft und des Engagements.\nDie Feuerwehr Poneggen besteht seit 120 Jahren und hat dieses Jubiläum mit einem vielfältigen Programm gefeiert. Das Fest begann am Freitag mit einem Kabarettabend, bei dem Walter Kammerhofer auftrat. Am Samstag folgte der Abschnittsfeuerwehrleistungsbewerb in Bronze und Silber der Jugend- und Aktivgruppen, bei dem insgesamt 123 Jugend- und 78 Aktivgruppen teilnahmen. Bei der Jugend- sowie auch der Aktivgruppe holten sich den Sieg in der Kategorie Silber die FF Winden-Windegg und in Bronze die FF Allerheiligen-Lebing. Die FF-Bewerbsgruppe Poneggen-Aisting-Furth sicherte sich in der 2. Klasse in den Kategorien Silber und Bronze jeweils den 2. Platz.\nDie Band \"Partykrocha\" sorgte am Nachmittag für Unterhaltung, während am Sonntag ein Frühschoppen mit der Marktmusik das Fest abrundete. Die Veranstaltung wurde durch die Unterstützung von mehr als 170 Helfer ermöglicht, was die starke Gemeinschaft innerhalb der Feuerwehr unterstreicht. Mit insgesamt 60 Mitgliedern, darunter 34 Aktive, 12 Jugendliche und 14 Reservisten, zeigt die kleine Feuerwehr eine beeindruckende Einsatzbereitschaft und Zusammenhalt. Das Jubiläum wurde auch genutzt, um langjährige Mitglieder zu ehren. Hervorzuheben ist die Auszeichnung von Helmut Voglhofer, der seit 1965 Mitglied ist. Bürgermeister Max Oberleitner überreichte ihm die Goldene Ehrennadel der Marktgemeinde Schwertberg.",

Incluso, durante una reciente reunión en la Casa Blanca con el expresidente Donald Trump, Bukele afirmó que no tiene planes de permitir el retorno del joven salvadoreño.\nI just met with the Vice President of El Salvador as we fight for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. I’m speaking to the press now with the latest on our efforts.\n— Senator Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen)\nTune in here:[https://t.co/lkB5v8BQEe][April 16, 2025]\nErrores, acusaciones infundadas y detenciones masivas\nKilmar Ábrego, de 29 años, huyó de la violencia pandillera a los 16 años. En 2019 obtuvo protección legal en Estados Unidos y nunca ha sido acusado de ningún delito, según sus abogados. Sin embargo, fue deportado en medio de un operativo masivo impulsado por el gobierno de Trump, en el que cientos de personas, en su mayoría venezolanos, fueron enviados a El Salvador sin pruebas, bajo la antigua Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros de 1798.\nTambién te puede interesar: “¡No la agarres así!”: Arresto de salvadoreña por agentes de inmigración en EU genera indignación en redes sociales (VIDEO)\nLas personas detenidas no han tenido acceso a abogados ni contacto con el exterior. Los vuelos continuaron a pesar de una orden judicial que los prohibía, lo que ha derivado en amenazas de desacato contra funcionarios de la anterior administración estadounidense.\nPersisten los esfuerzos por lograr justicia\n“La razón de mi visita es abogar por la liberación de Kilmar Ábrego García”, escribió Van Hollen en la red X.\nLe prometí a su familia que haría todo lo posible por traerlo de regreso y así será.\nMientras tanto, las autoridades estadounidenses intentan continuar el diálogo. Se espera que el secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Pete Hegseth, se reúna este mismo miércoles con el ministro de Defensa Nacional de El Salvador, René Merino, en el Pentágono.\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.
