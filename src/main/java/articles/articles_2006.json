As with purified water, it meets the classification requirement of 10ppm (parts per million of total dissolved solids, aka contaminants) or less. The process of distilling is simple: Heat tap water to the point that it turns to vapor. When the vapor condenses back to water, it leaves behind any mineral residue. The resulting condensed liquid is distilled water.\nThe Galaxy A series has also proven to be popular for Samsung. Galaxy A devices accounted for 58% of Samsung’s smartphone unit sales in 2021, according to Counterpoint Research data provided to CNET. And Samsung’s Galaxy A12 also landed on that same list of the top 10 best-selling phones of last year alongside the iPhone SE.\nTap water is the easy one. Turn on your kitchen faucet. Water comes out the tap. Voila! Tap water. The quality of tap water varies by location, and might contain traces of minerals specific to the geology of your region, as well as traces of chemicals used in municipal water treatment. Hopefully your tap water is safe to drink, but that’s not true for as many as 45 million Americans. Filtered water is one solution.\nThe first word you think of “I’m a high-risk, high-reward Wordle player. I truly pick the first word that pops into my mind, with absolutely no strategy whatsoever. Aside from this being the purest form of Wordling (as the experts say, obviously), when I’m lucky enough to accidentally guess three or four of five letters correctly, it’s immensely satisfying.” –Monisha Ravisetti\nMilitary experts say they are baffled by the ineptitude of the tactics displayed by Russia’s armies after drone footage showed a column of tanks getting picked off one-by-one in an ambush carried out by Ukraine’s forces.\nBig AUDIO dynamite “AUDIO. Get 4 out of 5 vowels out of the way immediately and focus on narrowing down consonants. Don’t be afraid to deviate from your regular starter word, though — sometimes a random word that pops into your head ends up being way more intuitive than you could have ever imagined.” –Ashley Esqueda\nIt’s long been thought the Bight is low in plankton biomass except during summer when nutrients supplied by upwelled ocean currents trigger phytoplankton blooms in the shelf and coastal waters west of Kangaroo Island.\nFiltered water starts out as plain tap water. You may already have filtered water in your home by way of a whole-house filtration system, a faucet filter or a water filtration pitcher (you can even get a filtered water bottle). Most filtered water passes through some combination of carbon and micron filters, which help to remove chemicals such as chlorine (commonly added to municipal tap water as a disinfectant) and pesticides, and metals like copper or lead. Filters can also eliminate foul odors and tastes.\nGet TEARY “I cycle through TEARY, PIOUS and ADIEU as a first word, to knock out some common letters and make inroads with vowels. I then choose my next word based on the results, though sometimes I just throw up my hands and use both TEARY and PIOUS one after the other no matter what.” –Amanda Kooser\nAlthough virtually invisible, the two self-feeding microscopic organisms represent the beginning of the food chain for the entirety of Earth’s aquatic mammal population including that which thrives in Australia’s prime marine habitats.\nThat’s the whole appeal behind the iPhone SE. It’s not about providing cutting edge tech like a depth scanner, multilens camera or vibrant OLED screen. It’s for people who just want an iPhone for basic everyday tasks at the lowest price possible.\nProject co-author and PhD student Michelle Newman said the research featured analysis of phytoplankton pigment markers, something which required a work-intensive and costly process of collecting water samples.\nSince, she has capitalized on the media attention gained from the coverage of her taunting of Caitlin Clark; appearing in Sports Illustrated and signed an NIL deal with Baton Rouge Mercedes Benz, among others.\nApple and Samsung seemingly agree on one thing: You don’t have to pay close to $1,000 to get a good phone anymore. But their respective visions differ greatly when it comes to what makes an affordable phone worthwhile.\nTo this end, Dr Mark Doubell of the South Australian Research and Development Institute has led more than 100 cruises employing the capabilities of the federally funded Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).\nUse weird words “You aren’t playing Wordle correctly if you use the same word to start every day. That’s my official rule and I’m flabbergasted y’all use the same word each day. What? Use weird words. Grab a dictionary, close your eyes and flick to a random page. Start with YACHT one day, try ULCER the next. Look around the room! TOAST? Why not? Just do it! Come on, people. It’s not about clearing each day in the least amount of moves, it’s about learning to love yourself.” –Jackson Ryan\nIf you have any type of inquiries relating to where and the best ways to use Components of reading assessment , you can contact us at our own web site.",

    "title": "Digital Drugs",
    "text": "Representational Photo By Ikkz Ikbal\nIn an era where screens dominate our lives, social media has become a digital drug—highly addictive, dangerously immersive, and alarmingly destructive. Children and adults alike are trapped in an endless cycle of scrolling, liking, sharing, and seeking validation from a virtual world that offers little substance but demands complete submission. Is social media the new-age cocaine, rewiring our brains and enslaving us to dopamine-driven illusions?\nWe often talk about drug addiction as a crisis, yet we fail to recognize that social media functions in much the same way. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter operate on an exploitative business model designed to keep us hooked. The more time we spend online, the more profitable we become to tech giants. But at what cost?\nChildren and Teens\nTheir developing brains are being hijacked by instant gratification. Likes, comments, and shares trigger dopamine surges, making social media as addictive as narcotics. Instead of playing outside, they are glued to screens, living in a fabricated reality where self-worth is measured by follower count. Anxiety, depression, and attention disorders are skyrocketing.\nMoreover, cyberbullying and online toxicity are further poisoning young minds. The pressure to maintain a flawless digital persona forces teens into a relentless cycle of comparison, self-doubt, and insecurity. Many suffer silently, masking their struggles behind carefully curated posts while battling real-life loneliness and identity crises. Social media, meant to connect, is ironically isolating an entire generation.\nAdults\nThey may not be making TikTok dances, but they are equally addicted—doom-scrolling news feeds, arguing over political debates, or refreshing notifications like slot machine gamblers. Work productivity is plummeting, real-life relationships are deteriorating, and sleep cycles are wrecked.\nEven more alarming is the shift in priorities—family dinners are interrupted by social media distractions, and moments that once held emotional significance are now seen through the lens of a potential Instagram story. Adults, who should be role models, are often just as guilty as teens, seeking digital validation instead of fostering genuine connections. The addiction is so deeply ingrained that many fail to recognize the damage until relationships are strained and mental well-being is compromised.\nThe Science Behind the Addiction\nSocial media engineers have mastered the art of psychological manipulation. Features like infinite scrolling, push notifications, and autoplay videos ensure users never stop. The fear of missing out (FOMO) and the craving for digital validation are just as powerful as drug withdrawal symptoms. Many can’t even sit through a meal without checking their phones—when did life become so empty without a screen?\nA Society on the Verge of Collapse?\nThe effects of social media addiction are not just personal—they are societal. Relationships suffer, attention spans shrink, and reality becomes distorted. Children idolize influencers who promote unrealistic beauty standards, while adults engage in endless online conflicts that lead to real-world hostility. Truth is becoming harder to distinguish from fake news, and deep human connections are being replaced with superficial interactions.\nIs There an Escape?\nThe first step in breaking free is acknowledging the problem. Social media detoxes, screen time limits, and real-life social interactions must become priorities. Parents need to regulate their children’s online exposure, while adults must set boundaries for themselves. The digital world should serve us—not the other way around.\nAre We Doomed?\nIf social media is our digital cocaine, are we beyond recovery? Or can we take control before it’s too late? The choice is ours, but one thing is clear—if we continue down this path, we might just become a society of zombies, endlessly chasing the next notification while real life slips away.\nThe Illusion of Connection\nIn a world more connected than ever, we have never been lonelier. We scroll through highlight reels, mistaking them for reality, and measure our worth through digital affirmations. The addiction to social media is not just about screen time—it’s about a slow erosion of presence, purpose, and personal connections.\nIf we are to reclaim our minds, we must break free from this digital illusion. Real conversations, real experiences, and real relationships must take precedence over fleeting online gratification. The choice isn’t easy, but it is necessary. The question remains—will we unplug before it’s too late, or will we continue chasing the next notification, oblivious to the world slipping through our fingers?",

Desde entonces, la guerra sigue anclada en el este de Europa. Sigue al minuto las últimas noticias del avance militar de Rusia y de la respuesta de Kiev. Estados Unidos impulsa vías para alcanzar el fin de la guerra. La tregua está más cerca.\nActualizar 12 JUN 2025 - 9:00\nUcrania dice que bajas rusas, entre muertos y heridos, han superado el millón desde 2022 El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ucraniano, Andrí Sibiga, afirmó este jueves que el número de bajas rusas ha superado el millón, entre muertos y heridos, en los casi tres años y medio desde que empezó la guerra en febrero de 2022. \"Un millón perdido para nada: Rusia no ha alcanzado ni uno solo de los objetivos estratégicos de sus objetivos a gran escala. Y no lo hará\", aseguró Sibiga en la red social X. El ministro subrayó que Ucrania no comenzó la guerra y quiere \"más que nadie\" que termine, pero que Rusia está obstaculizando todos los intentos para llegar a una solución negociada del conflicto, rechazando la propuesta de Kiev de un alto el fuego y de una reunión a nivel de presidentes. \"Hay que incrementar la presión sobre el agresor\", reclamó.\n12 JUN 2025 - 8:30\nAl menos 14 heridos en un nuevo ataque nocturno ruso contra Járkov Al menos 14 civiles resultaron heridos este jueves en un ataque nocturno con drones rusos contra la ciudad de Járkov, en el noreste de Ucrania, y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, un día después de que murieran tres personas y otras 60 fueran heridas en circunstancias similares. \"Por la noche, el enemigo atacó Járkov con drones.

Según el parte militar, en esta dirección los ucranianos contaron con 225 bajas desde el último comunicado durante combates en las localidades de Shevchenko, en la región ucraniana de Donetsk, Guliáipole y Malínovka, en la región de Zaporiyia, a unos 100 kilómetros entre las capitales de ambas regiones.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:55\nEl presidente de Serbia viaja a Ucrania por primera vez desde el inicio de la invasión rusa El presidente de Serbia , Aleksandar Vucic , aterrizará este miércoles en Ucrania en la que es su primera visita al país desde que comenzó la invasión rusa del territorio, un viaje que se enmarca en la cumbre que tendrá lugar en la ciudad de Odesa y en la que participarán más de una decena de líderes del sureste de Europa. Así lo ha confirmado la Presidencia serbia en un comunicado, en el que ha matizado que la visita de Vucic, que mantiene buenas relaciones y lazos históricos con Rusia, durará únicamente un día.\n11 JUN 2025 - 12:11\nRepatrian a Ucrania los restos mortales de más de 1.200 soldados caídos Los restos mortales de un total de 1 .212 soldados ucranianos caídos cuyos cadáveres estaban en manos de las autoridades rusas han sido retornados a Ucrania , según anunció este miércoles en un comunicado el órgano del Estado ucraniano que se ocupa de los prisioneros de guerra. Se trata del primer retorno de cadáveres que se anuncia desde que ucranianos y rusos acordaran el 2 de junio en Estambul canjear los restos mortales de 6.000 soldados de cada bando que están en posesión del enemigo.\n11 JUN 2025 - 8:33\nAl menos dos muertos y 60 heridos en un nuevo ataque ruso contra Járkov Al menos dos personas murieron y otras 60 resultaron heridas en un nuevo ataque con drones lanzado anoche por las fuerzas rusas contra la ciudad de Járkov , en el noreste de Ucrania y la segunda más grande del país después de Kiev, según ha informado la Policía ucraniana en un comunicado. Entre los heridos hay, según la fuente, cinco niños, de los que tres han tenido que ser trasladados a un centro médico. Los dos muertos son una mujer de 47 años y un hombre de 65.\n10 JUN 2025 - 22:53\nFelipe VI llega a Eslovaquia para visitar a las tropas españolas del despliegue de la OTAN ante Rusia El rey Felipe VI llegó hoy a Eslovaquia para visitar este miércoles a las tropas españolas que lideran la brigada multinacional que la OTAN tiene desplegada en este país como parte de las medidas disuasorias ante Rusia en Europa del Este.\nEn rey, que llegó a Bratislava acompañado por la ministra de Defensa, Margarita Robles , fue recibido por el presidente eslovaco, Peter Pellegrini, en su residencia oficial en la capital, el Palacio Grassalkovich.\nEslovaquia es miembro de la Alianza desde 2004 y de la Unión Europea (UE) desde 2007.\n10 JUN 2025 - 21:40\nEl ataque ruso contra Kiev provoca daños en una cornisa de la catedral de Santa Sofía El ataque ruso de anoche contra la capital ucraniana dañó una cornisa de la catedral de Santa Sofía , un monumento histórico protegido por la UNESCO cuyos orígenes se remontan al siglo XI.\nSegún explicó la directora del complejo que alberga la catedral, el daño sufrido por la cornisa, que fue construida en el siglo XVII, tardará en ser reparado alrededor de un mes y medio.\nEl daño en el edificio fue causado por la onda expansiva de una de las múltiples explosiones que sacudieron la pasada madrugada el centro y otras zonas de Kiev, debidas a la caída o las interceptaciones de los drones y misiles lanzados por Rusia.\n10 JUN 2025 - 20:19\nUcrania evalúa limitar la red móvil para contrarrestar la amenaza de drones rusos Ucrania estudia introducir restricciones temporales en los servicios de telefonía móvil para perturbar el uso que Rusia hace de las redes móviles ucranianas para recabar información durante los ataques cada vez más masivos con drones, según deliberaciones en el seno de la comisión de Defensa del Parlamento ucraniano.\nLos drones rusos de largo alcance, incluidos los Shahed de fabricación iraní, están cada vez más equipados con tarjetas SIM ucranianas de prepago para recoger y transmitir datos críticos durante los vuelos, según informan los expertos que analizan los restos de drones.\nEsta inteligencia ayuda a Rusia a perfeccionar sus operaciones con drones y amenaza con hacer sus ataques cada vez más eficaces.",

    "text": "El concurso 'Extremestiza Podcast: un puente sonoro entre Extremadura e Iberoamérica' invitará a los alumnos de entre 12 y 14 años a investigar la gastronomía compartida de la región extremeña y Perú.\nAsí, esta iniciativa que une la cultura, la educación y la creatividad tenderá un puente \"precioso\" entre Extremadura e Hispanoamérica y en el que el sonido será el vehículo para conectar \"historias, sabores y generaciones\", como ha destacado la consejera de Cultura, Turismo, Jóvenes y de Deportes, Victoria Bazaga.\nBazaga ha estado acompañada por la consejera de Educación, Ciencia y Formación Profesional, Mercedes Vaquera, quien, por su parte, ha puesto en valor la red de centros extremeños que cuentan con RadioEdu, la radio educativa de región y que facilitará la realización de los podcast.\nVictoria Bazaga ha indicado que este concurso se enmarca en el proyecto Extremestiza, que es una estrategia cultural con la que se quiere recuperar, compartir y dar valor al \"enorme legado común\" que Extremadura comparte con Hispanoamérica.\nEste mestizaje está presente en la lengua, en la música y también en la mesa, por ello, esta primera edición del concurso se centrará en la gastronomía compartida entre Extremadura y Perú.\nAsí, la Junta persigue que los alumnos extremeños y los peruanos de las ciudades de Lima y Trujillo, de entre 12 y 14 años, investiguen cómo se mezclaron los ingredientes de ambas zonas, qué productos viajaron entre ambos continentes, cómo surgieron nuevas recetas y sabores y que cuenten este trabajo de investigación en un podcast.\nPodrán participar grupos de hasta cuatro alumnos de centros educativos extremeños y peruanos siempre acompañados de un docente que será quien les guíe y coordine el trabajo y cada grupo creará un podcast de entre 10 y 15 minutos.\nEl formato será libre y los participantes podrán hacer entrevistas, reportajes, ficción sonora, usar música o efectos, ya que, según Bazaga, lo \"importante es que sea creativo, riguroso y con buen sonido, y, sobre todo, que ellos lo disfruten\".\n\"Queremos que se pregunten, por ejemplo, qué alimentos vinieron de América y hoy forman parte de la cocina extremeña, qué productos españoles enriquecieron la gastronomía peruana, qué platos tienen un origen compartido y nos cuentan una historia en común. La idea es que descubran, investiguen y lo transformen en una historia sonora que podamos escuchar y compartir\", ha asegurado la consejera de Cultura.\nEl premio para los grupos ganadores, uno de Extremadura y otro de Perú, será viajar al país andino y a la comunidad extremeña, respectivamente, en un \"viaje de ida y de vuelta lleno de experiencia, cultura y descubrimiento\".\nPara participar en el concurso 'Extremestiza Podcast: un puente sonoro entre Extremadura e Iberoamérica', los interesados se deben inscribir en la web del proyecto. El plazo para entregar los trabajos estará comprendido del 15 de septiembre al 30 de noviembre de 2025 y cada centro podrá presentar un podcast por aula.\nEn la evaluación de los podcast se valorará el rigor histórico, la creatividad y originalidad en el planteamiento, la calidad técnica del audio, la capacidad de colaboración entre los miembros del grupo, el enfoque constructivo del mensaje y el ingenio del uso de los recursos de los efectos.\nVictoria Bazaga ha valorado que este proyecto es posible gracias al impulso de la Fundación Extremeña de la Cultura, adscrita a la Consejería de Cultura, Turismo, Jóvenes y Deportes, y la colaboración de la Consejería de Educación, Ciencia y Formación Profesional.\nAsimismo, ha agradecido la implicación de la Embajada de Perú en España y del Ministerio de Educación peruano, además de los centros educativos, los docentes y las familias que formarán parte de este proyecto.",
