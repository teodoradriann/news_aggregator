    "text": "MELBOURNE: A fired-up Pat Cummins bagged five wickets and 10 in the match to earn Australia a nail-biting 79-run win in the second Test and clinch the series against a battling Pakistan Friday.\nSet 317 for victory, the visitors put up a stellar fight as they chased their first Test triumph in Australia since 1995.\nBut they were dismissed for 237, with the last five wickets falling for 18 runs.\nCummins was the chief destroyer, taking 5-49 to go with his first innings 5-48 — only the second 10-wicket haul of his Test career.\nMitchell Starc chipped in with 4-55 as the tail collapsed after Shan Masood (60), Agha Salman (50) and Babar Azam (41) gave them a fighting chance.\nIt was always going to be a tough task, with the highest-ever successful fourth innings run chase at the Melbourne Cricket Ground the 332-7 England managed in 1928, with no other team getting past 300.\nOpener Abdullah Shafique departed for four during a tricky session before lunch, caught by Usman Khawaja in the slips off Starc following a period of intense pressure.\nIman-ul-Haq survived the initial blitz, but was no match after the break for Cummins, who sent down a probing ball that nipped back and trapped him lbw for 12.\nMasood was given out lbw by the umpire on 12, but it was overturned on review and he quickly got back in his stride.\nHe took a nasty ball to the ribs that needed treatment, but was undeterred and raced to a gutsy 50 before Cummins again came to Australia’s rescue, enticing an edge to Steve Smith.\nThere was plenty resting on the shoulders of Azam as the side’s premier batter and he looked in good nick.\nBut after reaching 41, Josh Hazlewood got a ball to jag back and it clattered into his off stump.\nMohammad Rizwan also looked dangerous on his way to 35 before Cummins again worked his magic, with Alex Carey collecting a catch behind the stumps after the ball went off the batsman’s glove.\nCummins then removed Aamer Jamal and Shaheen Shah Afridi in quick succession before Starc cleaned up.\nThe Pakistanis padded up after the hosts were all out in their second innings for 262, after resuming on 187-6.\nMir Hamza was the best of the bowlers with 4-32, while Afridi took 4-76.\nCarey slammed 53 to help Australia build their overnight lead and quieten chatter about his form after losing his place in the one-day side to Josh Inglis.\nHe resumed on 16 after Australia had bounced back from 16-4 thanks to an attacking 96 from Mitchell Marsh and Smith’s gutsy 50.\nCarey, who made his first and only Test hundred in Melbourne a year ago, hit consecutive fours in his first over from Hasan Ali to build confidence.\nAt the other end, Starc lived dangerously and fell for nine with the impressive Afridi getting the breakthrough on a pitch still offering a bit for the bowlers.\nAzam took the sharp chance at slip after Starc miscued a drive.\nCummins made a breezy 16 but was caught behind by Rizwan off Jamal, while Lyon crunched two straight fours off Jamal, then was bowled for 11 three deliveries later.\nCarey brought up his sixth Test half-century before being the last man out, lbw to Hamza.",

    "text": "National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula has urged Kenyans to pray for President William Ruto and other government officials because “reviving the country’s economy is not as simple as it may appear.”\nMr Wetangula stressed that the challenges the country is currently facing require spiritual intervention.\nThe appeal comes amid difficulties faced by Kenyans including the high cost of living.\n“Pray for us leaders, including the President (William Ruto), his Deputy (Rigathi Gachagua), and myself, so that God may use us as vessels to resolve these challenges,” said Mr Wetangula.\nMr Wetangula further expressed his confidence that President Ruto had put in place robust strategies required to transform the lives of Kenyans.\nFormerly Bungoma Senator, Wetangula urged opponents of President Ruto’s regime to present innovative suggestions to challenge the government, contributing to the revitalization of the economy.\nDespite serving as former president Uhuru Kenyatta’s deputy for a decade, President Ruto maintains he inherited a dilapidated economy, making the task of revival challenging.\nWetangula has meanwhile also encouraged opposition members to develop creative policies while criticising the government to promote unity in the country.\nHe said: “As we usher in the new year (2024), I know President Ruto has plans to help improve the lives of Kenyans”.\n“God has blessed us; we had sufficient rainfall this year, resulting in abundant food. Next year, we anticipate having enough fertiliser to boost agricultural production.”\nIn early 2023, the William Ruto-led government launched a subsidised fertiliser program where a 50-kilogram bag was sold at Sh2,500, almost half its original price.\nThe farm input is distributed to farmers registered through a digital system.\nDespite increased agricultural production, Kenyans have been voicing concerns about the continually rising cost of living, especially after the government raised Value Added Tax (VAT) on petroleum products to 16 percent from 8 percent, and also introduced a number of levies to the payslip.\nAlso read: DPP consents to release of Sh400 million frozen Rwandan investors money\nKioni alleges plot to ‘illegally’ change the Constitution",

Même les États-Unis font mieux avec 28% de leur population formée.\nSeulement 24% des Canadiens ont reçu une formation en IA, ce qui crée de la méfiance envers cette technologie.\n«Le faible degré de formation en IA des Canadiens les empêche de [lui] faire confiance», explique le patron canadien du géant planétaire de l’audit, Benjie Thomas.\nLes pays riches dépassés\nCette méfiance se traduit dans les chiffres: seulement 34% des Canadiens acceptent de faire confiance à l'information générée par l'IA, contre 46% mondialement, selon le sondage.\nContrairement aux pays émergents qui dominent le classement, les économies avancées traînent de la patte.

Près de la moitié (48%) reconnaissent utiliser ces outils d'une manière qui pourrait violer les directives de leur employeur.\n« L'amélioration des connaissances en IA doit comprendre de solides initiatives éducatives adaptées», souligne un autre bonze de KPMG au Canada, l’associée directrice Stephanie Terrill.\nDe la formation, et vite!\nEn gros, un des quatre plus gros cabinets comptables au monde incite les entreprises canadiennes à s’activer et à offrir de la formation continue en IA à leurs employés.\nLes Canadiens ne rejettent pas l'IA pour autant.

Elle recommande une collaboration entre gouvernements, entreprises et établissements d'enseignement.\nPendant que le Canada hésite, d'autres pays foncent et sont en train de créer un écart de compétitivité qui pourrait coûter cher à long terme.",

    "text": "Sunak denies being ‘liar’ over £2,000 tax claim The Prime Minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was ‘obviously very rattled’ after he repeatedly deployed the attack line during an ITV debate. Rishi Sunak has denied Sir Keir Starmer’s accusations that he “lied” by saying Labour would hike taxes by £2,000 in claims criticised by the UK statistics watchdog. The Prime Minister said the Labour leader was “obviously very rattled” after he repeatedly deployed the attack line during an ITV election debate earlier this week. Mr Sunak had claimed that “independent Treasury officials” have costed Labour’s policies “and they amount to a £2,000 tax rise for everyone”. But the Treasury’s permanent secretary James Bowler said ministers had been told not to suggest civil servants produced the figure. In an interview published by ITV as the fallout deepened on Thursday, the Prime Minister said: “Keir Starmer and the Labour Party are obviously very rattled that we’ve exposed their plans to raise tax on people. And that’s what it, that’s what it demonstrates.” Asked whether the numbers were instead based on assumptions drawn up by Tory advisers, Mr Sunak said: “No. The analysis and the working is done by Treasury officials.” The row stems from a document produced by the Conservatives which made a series of assumptions to estimate the cost that might be attached to potential Labour policies. It said that Labour’s plans had a £38.5 billion deficit over four years, the equivalent of £2,094 for every working household, which the Tories claim would be filled with tax hikes. In a statement on Thursday, the Office for Statistics Regulation, which previously warned political parties to use figures appropriately during the campaign, suggested the Conservatives had failed to make clear their calculations. “Without reading the full Conservative Party costing document, someone hearing the claim would have no way of knowing that this is an estimate summed together over four years,” the statement read. “We warned against this practice a few days ago, following its use in presenting prospective future increases in defence spending.” Some of the estimated costings in the document were also produced by civil servants at the Treasury, using assumptions provided by politically appointed special advisers. But Mr Bowler said the headline figure used by the Tories should not be attributed to impartial civil servants because it went beyond that official work. Labour says many of its policies will not cost anywhere near as much as the Conservatives suggested in their dossier. Sir Keir has said the Prime Minister’s “made-up” claim had given an “insight into his character” and suggested he had broken the Ministerial Code by lying. The party is set to agree on a final version of its manifesto on Friday at the closed-doors Clause V meeting of MPs, union representatives and members. D-Day commemorations meant that campaigning for the July 6 polling day momentarily took a backseat earlier on Thursday, with the Prime Minister addressing veterans in Normandy.",

    "text": "Britain has stood with Ukraine since very outset of war - Zelensky President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said this in an interview with Britain’s [Channel 4 News.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWrM1fJI2HQ) \"The UK has been with us from first days and up till now. I met with all your prime ministers,\" he said. According to the head of state, Ukraine has good relations with Britain not only at the highest political level. \"We also have very good relations at the level of intelligence. But you should know that I have relations with your intelligence. We are very open and I speak with some of your leaders. I am not such a person who speaks only with prime ministers or His Majesty. No, no, we are very deep partners and we have very good relations. We speak every time – by phone, at meetings, official or unofficial,\" Zelensky added. He also noted that, while people might be replaced, institutional and historical relationships between countries must be preserved. As Ukrinform reported earlier, on January 12, President Zelensky and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held the negotiations in Kyiv and signed a security cooperation agreement. According to the deal, Great Britain will provide a package of military aid to Ukraine worth GBP 2.5 billion. Also, the agreement provides for the annual provision of additional aid for the next 10 years and automatic donation of weapons to Ukraine in the event of any new act of aggression targeting the nation. The document also emphasizes that the parties to the agreement will continue to explore ways to further strengthen their long-term relationship, including working toward a century-long partnership.

    "title": "La bebé hallada en un contenedor de Sevilla se llama Nieves y ya tiene familia adoptiva",
    "text": "La bebé recién nacida que fue rescatada en un contenedor el pasado 18 de diciembre en Los Palacios y Villafranca ( [Sevilla](/tags/sevilla/)) ha sido dada de alta y ya se encuentra con su nueva familia, tras pasar diez días ingresada en la unidad de neonatos del hospital Virgen de Valme de Sevilla. Según ha adelantado COPE Sevilla y han confirmado a EFE fuentes de la [Junta de Andalucía](/tags/junta-de-andalucia/), la niña fue dada de alta en la tarde de ayer, y ya se encuentra en la casa de la familia que la ha adoptado, tras las gestiones urgentes realizadas por la Consejería de Inclusión Social, Juventud, Familias e Igualdad de la Junta de Andalucía. Los nuevos padres de la niña comenzaron a tener contacto con ella el pasado 24 de diciembre, y desde entonces la han acompañado en el hospital, hasta que finalmente ayer fue dada de alta. Las fuentes no han indicado si la familia la llamará finalmente Nieves, el nombre que los médicos le pusieron en el hospital al ser el de la patrona de Los Palacios. La nueva familia, según informa Igualdad, se ha hecho cargo de la pequeña mediante la fórmula de \"guarda y custodia con fines de adopción\", mediante la que tendrán a la pequeña con ella el menos seis meses. Adopción de urgencia Se trata de una fórmula de adopción de urgencia, y una vez que pasen los seis meses podrán comenzar a gestionar la adopción definitiva, un proceso que se podría interrumpir si algún familiar de la bebé mostrase su disposición a hacerse cargo de ella y cumpliese las condiciones necesarias para ello. No obstante, desde que fue encontrada la menor nadie se ha dirigido a las autoridades reclamando ser su familiar, de modo que se prevé que la familia se haga cargo de ella de forma definitiva a partir de junio próximo, mientras sigue la investigación de la Guardia Civil para intentar encontrar a su madre o a la persona que la tiró al contenedor. La niña ingresó con un peso de 2,1 kilos, y ha estado cuidada las 24 horas del día por los servicios médicos del hospital, mientras la Junta recibía decenas de peticiones de ofrecimientos de familias andaluzas dispuestas a adoptarla, aunque en este caso la adopción pasaba por un proceso que dura meses y para el que había familias concretas en lista de espera. No obstante, la Junta ha animado a las familias que quieran estar en una lista de un proceso de adopción a que lo inicien cuanto antes, de modo que cuando se produzcan casos de extrema necesidad, como el de esta bebé, haya familias suficientes en espera. La niña pudo ser encontrada gracias a que un vecino escuchó su llanto desde el interior del contenedor, para posteriormente unirse a él dos mujeres, y una de ellas la sacó rápidamente, llevándola al centro de salud del municipio, situado a un kilómetro aproximadamente de donde fue encontrada. Nada más ser revisada se activó su traslado urgente al hospital sevillano, mientras que la Policía Judicial de la Guardia Civil se ha hecho cargo de la investigación del caso, una vez que se resolvió la primera urgencia que tenía el mismo, que era garantizar la evacuación de la niña a un centro sanitario cuanto antes.",

    "title": "Hundreds attend groundbreaking of second Latter-day Saint temple in Rexburg",
    "text": "Published at | Updated at REXBURG – The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially broke ground on its second temple in Rexburg Saturday morning. The three-story, 100,000-square-foot Teton River Temple will be built on a 16.6 acre parcel at North Second East and Moody Drive across the street from Walmart, just over three miles from the Rexburg Temple that was dedicated in 2008. RELATED | Latter-day Saint leaders will break ground on second Rexburg temple this weekend Elder Ricardo P. Giménez, a General Authority Seventy and second counselor in the North America Central Area presidency, presided over the ceremony with hundreds of church members in attendance. “Our hearts are filled with joy and reverence as we gather to commemorate the monumental occasion of a second temple being erected in this special land of Rexburg, Idaho,” Giménez said during a dedicatory prayer. The 52-year-old from Chile, South America blessed the site during the temple’s construction that it would be “protected and hallowed” and that every person who plays a role in its completion would feel inspired and guided in their responsibilities. Latter-day Saint temples differ from the meetinghouses or chapels where members meet for Sunday worship services. A temple, according to a news release from the church, is considered a “house of the Lord,” where Christ’s teachings are reaffirmed through marriage, baptism, and other ordinances that unite families for eternity. Inside, members learn more about the purpose of life and make covenants to serve Jesus Christ and their fellowman. During the groundbreaking, Giménez explained the temple “is a holy place” where church members worship Jesus Christ and “remember what he has done for them.” “If there is something that I hope … you will remember about this day is the love our Heavenly Father and Savior has for you,” Giménez told the crowd. “Their utmost desire for each one of us is to return home and be with them forever.” “Our message is that Jesus Christ lives,” Giménez added. Others who spoke at the event include Brent Kinghorn, a church member from Sugar City and a former member of the presidency for the Rexburg Temple. During his remarks, Kinghorn took note of the temple’s name and said it’s fitting because it “will sit in the center of an island between the two forks of the Teton River.” It’s not clear why this specific location was selected, but Kinghorn suggested the wave of water that engulfed the area during the collapse of the Teton Dam in 1976 “cleansed this location for a future temple.” RELATED | Museum of Rexburg invites community to fourth annual Teton Dam flood commemoration Temple construction will begin Monday. It’s expected to take up to three years to complete. A public open house and tour of the temple will be announced as the completion date gets closer. Once it’s dedicated, only members with an ecclesiastical endorsement are allowed to enter. The Teton River Temple was announced in Oct. 2021 by church President Russell M. Nelson and will stand close in size to some of the largest temples in the world, according to a fact sheet provided to local media. The Salt Lake City Temple, which is currently being renovated, is the largest temple at 382,207 square feet. This will be the fifth temple in eastern Idaho and the ninth in the Gem State. The Idaho Falls Temple is the state’s oldest temple. RELATED | LDS Church holds ceremonial temple groundbreaking Church leaders broke ground on a 27,000-square foot temple in Montpelier last year. The Pocatello temple was dedicated in 2021. RELATED | Pocatello LDS temple dedicated with cornerstone ceremony Idaho is home to more than 470,000 Latter-day Saints in over 1,200 congregations. The Teton River Temple is expected to serve church members from Rexburg to Island Park. Though more than 90% of Rexburg’s total population are Latter-day Saints, Mayor Jerry Merrill, who is a member of the church, tells EastIdahoNews.com the temple will benefit every member of the community. “It just makes people try to be better people, at least I hope it does,” Merrill says. “It’s a place of peace and I think (that’s why) people who aren’t members like living here.” Worldwide church membership is 17,225,394, according to the latest data . As of April 1, the LDS Church has 335 temples in various stages of construction. Of those, 189 have been dedicated. WATCH HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GROUNDBREAKING IN THE VIDEO ABOVE.",

    "text": "On Maundy Thursday, Pope Francis performed the ritual washing of the feet of twelve prison inmates in a Roman women’s prison. In the late afternoon, Francis celebrated mass in the Rebibbia prison in memory of the last supper of Jesus.\nFor the rite of washing the feet, Francis was pushed in a wheelchair in front of a platform on which the twelve women sat. While sitting, the 87-year-old church leader washed and kissed the feet of the visibly moved women, following Jesus’ gesture of humility to his disciples. Because the Pope is in poor health, it was actually expected that a priest would wash the women’s feet in his place.\nIn his short homily at the service in an improvised chapel in the prison courtyard, the pope spoke about the theme of forgiveness. “Jesus always forgives, he only asks that we ask for forgiveness.” Every person has their own story, “but Jesus is always waiting for us and never tires of forgiving.”\nNumerous female prisoners, guards and prison chaplains took part in the simple celebration with guitar accompaniment. The intercessions also included prayers for those people who committed suicide in prison.\nThe Rebibbia prison in eastern Rome is the largest of Italy’s four women’s prisons. With around 350 inmates, the prison, like many others in the country, is constantly overcrowded. There are 2,000 convicted criminals in the neighboring men’s prison.\nThe Easter Triduum, the commemoration of Jesus’ suffering, death and resurrection, begins with the Maundy Thursday service. Pope Francis wants to personally lead all Holy and Easter services in the Vatican in the coming days. As last year, he leaves many liturgical activities to the cardinals.\nePaper\nRead the ePaper now!\nRead the daily ePaper edition of the OÖNachrichten – browse through it digitally now!\nto the e-paper\ninfo By clicking on the icon you can add the keyword to your topics.\ninfo\nBy clicking on the icon you open your “my topics” page.
