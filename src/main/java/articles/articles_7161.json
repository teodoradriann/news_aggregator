    "text": "TARRAGONA, 11 Jul. 2025 (Europa Press) - Los Bombers de la Generalitat han dado por controlado a las 22.56 horas de este jueves el incendio forestal de Paüls (Tarragona) cuatro días después de su inicio. La extensión total quemada asciende a 3321 hectáreas, según ha detallado Agents Rurals. Hasta primera hora de la tarde los efectivos de extinción todavía han tenido que remojar pequeñas humaredas, pero hacia las 20.00 horas los vehículos repartidos por el perímetro han enviado informes favorables de sus áreas, en los que han constatado que \"ninguna columna ni puntos calientes puedan revivir de manera inmediata\", ha informado Bombers en un comunicado. Sin embargo, el incendio, que comenzó el lunes 7 de julio al mediodía, estará un mínimo de 72 horas bajo observación antes de poder darlo por extinguido. Esta noche permanecerán 13 dotaciones que seguirán remplazando la superficie quemada y afianzando el perímetro. Los efectivos continuarán trabajando con la misma firmeza pese al accidente mortal de esta tarde, en el que un técnico del Equipo de Prevención Activa Forestal (EPAF) ha fallecido al caer por un desnivel mientras realizaba tareas de extinción en una zona escarpada. El Sistema de Emergencias Médicas ha realizado siete atenciones más durante la extinción de este incendio, todas de carácter leve. Bombers ha decretado para este viernes día de luto y al mediodía se hará un minuto de silencio en memoria del compañero fallecido en acto de servicio.",

    "text": "The Democratic National Convention continues despite the raging protests of confused pro-Palestinian Democrat voters standing outside in Chicago — and day two was one for the books. Not only did the show feature a cringeworthy dance routine from Chuck Schumer and an awkward entrance by VP pick Tim Walz, but it also featured a very special, famous guest. That guest was Michelle Obama, and she used the opportunity to give her best pro-Kamala performance to the American people, as she talked about “hope.” “Until recently, I have mourned the dimming of that hope, and maybe you’ve experienced the same feelings — that deep pit in my stomach, a palpable sense of dread about the future,” Obama told the crowd. “She’s talking about this ‘hope’ that she felt like was just escaping us, it was getting dimmer and dimmer until now that Kamala Harris is running,” Sara Gonzales of “Sara Gonzales Unfiltered” says, adding, “You guys have been in charge the last three and a half years.” “In fact, you guys have been in charge 12 of the last 16 years,” she continues, stifling a yell. “Why do you think things might not be going so hot?” Not only have the Democrats been in charge a majority of the past 16 years, Kamala Harris is the second most powerful position in an administration that has left the border open wide and continues to gaslight the American people about prices at the grocery store. “But that crowd is probably too stupid to figure that out,” Gonzales comments. Glenn Beck’s chief writer and researcher, Jason Buttrill, is in full agreement. “So are their candidates, to be perfectly honest,” he laughs, adding, “as you point out, they’ve only lost power in the last 12 years for four years. That’s it. And pretty much everything that happened was wiped out on day one of Biden’s presidency through executive order.” Want more from Sara Gonzales?

    "text": "A Prayer of Surrender to Jesus’ Calling - Your Daily Prayer - December 29 - [Sign Up for Email?](javascript:void(0)) - Published Dec 26, 2023 A [Prayer](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/) of Surrender to Jesus’ Calling By Kristine Brown “Then, calling the crowd to join his disciples, he said, ‘If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me.’” ( [Mark 8:34]NLT) Sometimes my life feels like a back-and-forth battle with control. One day I’m easily relinquishing my own way in [favor of God](https://www.crosswalk.com/slideshows/what-is-god-s-favor-and-how-do-we-get-it.html)’s plan. Other days I have to keep surrendering over and over because the pull of being in control is just too strong. “Give up your own way…” Those five simple words Jesus spoke to the crowd may be the ones I wrestle with the most. I get attached to my own way of doing things. Soon self-sufficiency rises and I start making decisions in my own strength, trying too hard, and wearing myself out. I end up exhausted instead of welcoming the peace Jesus offers. Surrender. It’s a hard concept for us to grasp because God gave us the will to choose. Surrender means to give up complete control. To yield to the power of another. Surrender is an amazing gift offered to us. Wouldn’t we rather hand over control of our lives to the One who holds power over all things? Then why do we struggle to surrender when Jesus calls? God designed us to hope, dream, create, and build. We long to do great things and make an impact on our world. So we must pray and find our purpose using the gifts God gave us, while daily surrendering our lives and hearts to Him. Mark chapter 8 tells us about Jesus’ ministry—from feeding four thousand people to healing one blind man. After a private word with his disciples, Jesus turned to a crowd and explained how to surrender. Jesus said, “If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, you will save it. And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?” ( [Mark 8:35-36](https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/passage/?q=mark+8:35-36)) In our efforts to do good, let’s not forget the presence of our Holy God. Today let’s pray this prayer of surrender. Jesus is calling us to release control and follow His ways instead of our own. Let's pray: Dear Heavenly Father, I hear your precious son Jesus gently calling me, yet I realize I’ve let the temptation of control keep me from responding to his voice. Forgive me for trying to do things on my own when I know your ways are best. I surrender to Jesus today. Thank you for sending the Holy Spirit to draw me back to you in those times when I’ve relied on my own strength. Your Word in [John 14:26](https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/14-26.html) says, “But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.” Thank you for reminding me that if I want to follow Jesus, I need to release my own way. I have felt your Holy Spirit tugging at my heart. So I am laying down my own plans, desires, and goals. I replace those right now with total surrender to your will. I am grateful for the guidance of the Holy Spirit and that Jesus never stops pursuing a deeper relationship with me. Your will be done in my life, Lord. I will follow where you lead me. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
