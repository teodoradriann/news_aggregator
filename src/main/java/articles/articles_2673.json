The head of state said this in a video address to the nation, Ukrinform reports.\n\"Today, much attention was also given to domestic issues – the decisions and innovations needed in the long term to ensure that Ukraine can bring back as many of our people as possible who left because of the war. We must create all the necessary economic and social incentives for Ukrainians to work in Ukraine, to work for Ukraine, and to build greater potential for Ukraine to compete equally on the global stage. The Ukrainian people have proven their courage and can demonstrate to the world their ability to recover and rebuild from the ruins,\" Zelensky said.\nRead also: Zelensky: U.S. increasing military aid to Ukraine He said that a meeting had been held on these issues with Deputy Prime Ministers Oleksiy Chernyshov, Mykhailo Fedorov, and Oleksii Kuleba, as well as with the team of the Office of the President of Ukraine.\n\"We are also preparing for talks tomorrow with representatives of Ukrainian businesses – to discuss the systemic solutions needed now and in the future to give Ukraine greater confidence and a strong economic pulse,\" Zelensky said.\nOn December 4, the Cabinet of Ministers decided to rename the Ministry for the Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine into the Ministry of National Unity of Ukraine.\nOleksiy Chernyshov was appointed Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Unity.\nThe new ministry will institutionally strengthen the policy towards Ukrainians who had to go abroad in different years. This was the task that Zelensky set when presenting an Internal Resilience Plan. In particular, the ministry will develop and implement programs to return Ukrainians from migration.\nThe new deputy prime minister is expected to present a clear plan for the development of the ministry in the near future.\nPhoto: Office of the President of Ukraine",

    "text": "Tragedia en San José: el siniestro vial más grave del año en Misiones\nEl vuelco de un colectivo que transportaba trabajadores forestales, ocurrido este jueves sobre la ruta nacional 14 en jurisdicción de San José, fue calificado como el siniestro vial más trágico del año en Misiones, con un saldo confirmado de siete personas fallecidas y más de diez heridas de gravedad.\nEste accidente se produce en un contexto alarmante para la seguridad vial en la provincia. Sçolo en enero de 2025, los siniestros viales en rutas y calles misioneras dejaron 16 víctimas fatales, según un relevamiento de El Territorio basado en datos de la Policía de Misiones. Esa cifra supera el total de muertes registradas durante todo 2024, marcando un aumento preocupante en los primeros meses del año.\nHasta ahora, el hecho con más víctimas había sido el ocurrido el pasado 3 de marzo en el municipio de Garuhapé, sobre la Ruta Nacional 12. Allí, cuatro personas -entre ellas una niña de 9 años- murieron tras un choque múltiple. El siniestro ocurrió alrededor de las 18 en el kilómetro 1482, cuando un Citroën C3 colisionó con una camioneta Ford EcoSport y luego se desvió de la ruta, impactando de lleno contra un árbol fuera de la calzada.\nEl siniestro de San José ocurrió cuando un colectivo de doble piso, que transportaba a trabajadores forestales de una empresa correntina, habría sufrido un desperfecto mecánico, despistó y volcó. La Red de Traslado de Misiones activó un amplio operativo sanitario, derivando heridos a centros de salud en San José, Apóstoles, Cerro Azul y Posadas, incluido el Hospital Escuela Ramón Madariaga.\nLa tragedia renovó la preocupación en torno a la seguridad vial en la provincia y dejó en evidencia la necesidad urgente de reforzar los controles y condiciones del transporte de pasajeros.",

    "text": "Kamiya Jani is known for her videos showcasing Indian culture and cuisines. YouTuber Kamiya Jani's visit to the Jagannath Temple in Puri triggered a political row earlier this week as the BJP accused the state government of facilating the entry of a \"beef consumption promoter\". The influencer today issued a clarification saying that she is a practicing Hindu and has never \"eaten or promoted beef\". \"My motive behind going to Jagannath was to seek the blessings of Lord Jagannath and present information about the temple's infrastructure. I am a practicing Hindu. I have never eaten beef, and don't promote it ever,\" Ms Jani said in a video on her Instagram page. \"In the wake of the recent controversy, it is important that I put out real facts and the truth. This one incident, in no way, will shake my pride in my country and its rich culture. I am and will always be a proud Indian,\" she said. A post shared by Kamiya Jani (@kamiya_jani) The controversy broke out after Ms Jani posted a video highlighting Shree Jagannath's culture. The video also featured bureaucrat-turned-BJD leader VK Pandian speaking on the importance of 'Mahaprasad', the ongoing heritage corridor project and other aspects linked to temple development. The BJP charged the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader of facilitating the entry of Ms Jani, who is accused of promoting beef consumption on a YouTube channel, in the 12th century shrine where the entry of non-Hindus is prohibited. \"The sacred sanctity of Puri Srimandir, rich with historical and spiritual heritage, has been shamefully disregarded by VK Pandian, the chairman of 5T, who callously allowed a beef promoter into the revered premises of Jagannath Mandir. Those responsible must face swift and severe consequences,\" wrote the Odisha unit of BJP in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The post also featured photos of Ms Jani at a restaurant which serves beef. The 35-year-old creator clarified that the photos were from a video shot in Kerala where she visited a restaurant started by two truck drivers which has become famous for its beef dish. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"Screenshots of one such video of mine, which was shot in Kerala, are being used. The story was about two truck drivers who started a outlet in Kerala and their beef dish has become a hit. Since I do not eat beef, I had veg black chana curry, rice appam and banana fritters,\" Ms Jani said. \"There are various other videos I have made about local cuisines, but that does not mean I eat it all. I hope this clarification reaches the people who were hurt by the misunderstanding,\" she added. A post shared by Kamiya Jani (@kamiya_jani) The BJD had hit back at the BJP saying that several of their party leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promoted Kamiya Jani's documentary on Hindu heritage and temples.",
