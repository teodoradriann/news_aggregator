    "title": "Mickey Rourke Given 'Formal Warning' for 'Offensive' Comments About JoJo Siwa in 'Big Brother'",
    "text": "No offensive language will be tolerated on Celebrity Big Brother UK.\nMickey Rourke was issued a warning from the reality television series’ producers after a series of comments he made toward fellow competitor JoJo Siwa, according to BBC. During the 24th season, the actor asked Siwa if she liked “girls or boys,” to which the “Karma” singer explained that she’s attracted to women and that her partner Kath Ebbs is non-binary.\n“If I stay longer than four days,” the 72-year-old then responded, “you won’t be gay anymore.”\nSiwa replied by assuring, “I can guarantee I’ll still be gay and I’ll still be in a very happy relationship.”\nLater in the series, when the cast mates were called to vote someone out of the house, Mickey explained that he’s “going to vote the lesbian out real quick,” to which Siwa — who overheard the comment, replied, “That’s homophobic, if that was your reasoning.”\nAt one point in the series, Rourke said that he needed a “f–,” and gestured to the 21-year-old star and said, “I’m not talking to you.” When fellow competitor Chris Hughes called him out for the language, the actor said, “I know. I was talking about a cigarette.”\nAfter using the slur, which is slang for a cigarette in the U.K., he was warned by the ITV series’ Big Brother about his actions in the confessional room. “Big Brother thinks your language was offensive and unacceptable,” he was told. “As a result, Big Brother is giving you a formal warning. Further language or behaviour of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.”\nUltimately, the actor explained that he didn’t have “dishonorable intentions” and apologized to Siwa. “I want to apologize. I’ve got a habit of having a short fuse,” he told her. “And I don’t mean nothing by it. I do mean it [sorry]. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t say it to you.”\n“I appreciate your apology,” she replied. Siwa has yet to publicly address the situation.\n Read More Details\nFinally We wish PressBee provided you with enough information of ( Mickey Rourke Given ‘Formal Warning’ for ‘Offensive’ Comments About JoJo Siwa in ‘Big Brother’ )\nAlso on site :",

    "text": "Cervezas de pequeños productores tienen los niveles más altos de contaminación química. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Un reciente estudio llevado a cabo por RTI Internationa l ha identificado la presencia de sustancias químicas permanentes en cervezas producidas en Estados Unidos , atribuyendo su origen al agua potable municipal utilizada en el proceso de elaboración.\nSegún el informe, publicado en la revista Environmental Science & Technology y citado por Newsweek , estas sustancias, conocidas como PFAS (sustancias perfluoroalquiladas y polifluoroalquiladas), se encontraron en cervezas elaboradas en áreas donde ya se había documentado la contaminación del agua con estos compuestos.\nEste hallazgo pone de relieve un problema más amplio relacionado con la seguridad de los alimentos y bebidas frente a contaminantes ambientales .\nQué son los PFAS y el daño que provoca en las personas\nLa exposición a PFAS está vinculada a riesgos de cáncer y problemas inmunológicos. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Los PFAS son compuestos sintéticos ampliamente utilizados en productos como utensilios de cocina antiadherentes , telas resistentes al agua y espumas ignífugas . Su apodo, “sustancias químicas permanentes”, se debe a su capacidad para persistir tanto en el medio ambiente como en el cuerpo humano durante largos períodos .\nLa exposición a estas sustancias ha sido vinculada por la Agencia de Protección Ambiental de Estados Unidos ( EPA por sus siglas en inglés ) con problemas de salud que incluyen alteraciones hormonales , daños al sistema inmunológico y un mayor riesgo de ciertos tipos de cáncer .\nLos estados en los que se realizó el estudio y sus resultados\nCarolina del Norte y Michigan, los estados con mayor concentración de cervecerías afectadas. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) El estudio analizó cervezas de nueve estados de Estados Unidos, incluyendo Carolina del Norte, Michigan, Colorado, California, Massachusetts, Pensilvania, Wisconsin y Misuri , además de cervezas internacionales producidas en México y los Países Bajos .\nLos resultados mostraron que las mayores concentraciones de PFAS se encontraron en cervezas elaboradas en el condado de Chatham y el condado de Mecklenburg en Carolina del Norte, así como en el condado de Kent en Michigan.\nEstas áreas han sido identificadas previamente como regiones con sistemas de agua contaminados por PFAS, lo que hace que las cervecerías locales sean especialmente susceptibles a este problema.\nEl informe destacó que aproximadamente el 18% de las cervecerías en Estados Unidos operan en códigos postales donde el agua contiene niveles detectables de PFAS. Las cervecerías más pequeñas, que suelen depender del agua municipal sin tratamientos adicionales, presentaron los niveles más altos de contaminación .\nLas probabilidades de obtener más PFAS\nEstudio revela 8.800 localidades con agua contaminada por PFAS en EEUU. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) Según los investigadores, las cervezas producidas cerca de fuentes de agua con altas concentraciones de PFAS tenían 15 veces más probabilidades de contener estas sustancias en comparación con cervezas elaboradas en áreas sin contaminación conocida.\nUn mapa actualizado por el Grupo de Trabajo Ambiental (EWG) muestra más de 8.800 ubicaciones en Estados Unidos con contaminación conocida por PFAS en los sistemas de agua.\nAdemás, el EWG estima que 143 millones de personas en el país tienen acceso a agua potable con resultados positivos para PFAS, y un estudio de 2020 indicó que más de 200 millones de estadounidenses podrían estar expuestos a concentraciones de estos compuestos superiores a 1 parte por trillón (ppt).\nLa declaración de la autora del estudio y su preocupación\nEl EWG estima que 143 millones de personas en EE. UU. consumen agua con PFAS detectables. (Imagen Ilustrativa Infobae) La autora principal del estudio, Jennifer Hoponick Redmon, expresó su preocupación por los hallazgos y señaló la importancia de implementar medidas para abordar este problema.\nEn declaraciones a Newsweek , afirmó que mejorar la filtración del agua en las plantas de tratamiento o directamente en las cervecerías podría reducir la presencia de PFAS en las cervezas. También subrayó la necesidad de prevenir la entrada de estas sustancias en los suministros de agua para proteger tanto a las cervecerías como a los consumidores.\nEl estudio también enfatizó la importancia de que los consumidores estén informados sobre el origen de las cervezas que consumen y las condiciones locales del agua utilizada en su producción.\nSegún RTI International, las cervecerías pequeñas y medianas , que suelen carecer de sistemas avanzados de tratamiento de agua , enfrentan mayores desafíos para garantizar la seguridad de sus productos frente a contaminantes como los PFAS.\nLa investigación pone de manifiesto la necesidad de mejorar las prácticas de filtración de agua en la industria cervecera, especialmente en regiones con antecedentes de contaminación. Este problema no solo afecta a las cervecerías locales, sino que también plantea preocupaciones más amplias sobre la calidad del agua potable y su impacto en la salud pública.",

She said Sati’s acts of heroism went beyond expectations.\nDespite the terrifying ordeal at the festival, Sanandaji conveyed feeling safer in Israel than in the United States.\nShe voiced concerns over the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the US, particularly in her hometown of New York, citing various acts of hate targeting the Jewish community.\nSanandaji ran for her life while getting gunned down by terrorists on October 7, ultimately surviving the horrific massacre.\nAlthough she made it out alive and returned to her home in Long Island a week later, she said she does not feel any safer back in the US.\nOn October 7, she and three friends were camping overnight at the Supernova Sukkot Gathering near Re’im, an event billed as a night of ‘friends, love and infinite freedom’ to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot with electronic music.\nOn the first evening, nothing was out of the ordinary. But moments before dawn broke on Saturday, explosions appeared in the sky.\n‘We were woken up by one of our friends who came to tell us some rockets had been sent over.’ For many of her friends, this is normal. ‘But this is not something that I am used to seeing.’\nIn October, Sanandaji told DailyMail.com many were still in the crowd dancing when the first salvoes of rockets passed overhead. For a time, it was not clear what was happening. Some festival-goers were seen walking away from the disruption. Others carried on, unaware.\nDespite the terrifying ordeal at the festival, Sanandaji conveyed feeling safer in Israel than in the United States\n‘Many people who were in the crowd had told me that they thought the noises were coming from the music,’ Natalie said.\n‘After a few minutes, we started to realize that the rockets just kept coming and kept coming and kept coming. Though first time I really realized how severe the situation was becoming was when they shut off the music.’\nSecurity guards reacted quickly, at first telling guests to get down and cover their faces. As the missiles closed in, they told guests to pack what they could and evacuate as soon as possible.\n‘They were there until the end,’ Natalie explained. ‘Most of them had died, guiding us and trying to get us to safety.’\n‘Everybody started driving in one direction. There was traffic from so many cars being in such a confined space all trying to leave at the same time.\n‘Even at that point, in my head I was thinking, “OK, if it’s just rockets, if they’re not in our vicinity, we have the Iron Dome. Some scrap from intercepted rockets could hit our cars. But we’ll be in our cars. We’ll be okay. We’ll get out of here. It might take a few hours because there’s so many people, but we’ll be fine.”\n‘When we started driving in one direction, security started telling people to drive in another direction. That’s when we realized that there must be something else going on other than just the rockets.\n‘Security started yelling at everybody “get out of your cars,” “park your cars on the side of the dirt road and run!”\n‘I didn’t understand why at first… and then we heard the first gunshots.’\nWithin moments, gunmen had entered the festival on motorbikes, in vans and by motorized paraglider and started shooting at the event’s 3,500 attendees with Kalashnikov assault rifles.\nAt least 260 people died in the massacre, with many victims shot in the back as they tried to run. Countless were injured, and many more taken back into Gaza as hostages.\nNatalie only knew that she had to keep moving.\n‘The security told us to pull over to the side of the road: “Being in the cars is making you too easy of a target – get out of your car and start running.”\nNatalie Sanandaji escaped the massacre with a group of friends on Saturday, October 7, 2023\n“These are the only photos I have from the festival. Obviously didn’t have much time to take any other photos or videos since we were running for our lives.” – Natalie Sanandaji, 28\nDestroyed cars and personal items are still left scattered around the festival site, on October 13\n‘As soon as we heard the first gunshots… I was there with three people, we were in the car together. We opened the doors and we started running for our lives.\n‘After that we just ran. I remember at a certain point there was a bit of a ditch. And we were contemplating if we should go into the ditch and hide, or if we should keep running. And we kept running. A lot of people that went into the ditch are not here today. Every decision we made ended up saving our lives. But we had… no one had any idea what decision to make. You just had to make a decision in that moment.’\n‘We ran for about four hours, on and off. In between the gunshots, anytime the gunshots would subdue for a little bit, we would say, “Okay, we’re going to, we’re going to walk a little slower, we’re going to catch our breath.”\n‘The scariest thing for me was running in a certain direction – thinking that you’re running to safety – and then suddenly seeing dozens of other kids running in your direction and realizing that they’re running from a terrorist, that they are running from shooting.\n‘These were innocent children. We had nothing to protect ourselves. Imagine you’re in an open field with nowhere to hide and they are coming at you from every direction.\n‘Kids were running in all different directions and you had to make a split-second decision on where to run, to where you thought it would be safe.\n‘And that decision would either save your life or get you killed or kidnapped.’\nThe group of four continued to follow the road out of Re’im. Their last instruction from camp security had been to push on to the nearest town. For miles, they walked along the banks of short grassland and fields with little in the way of protection.\nAn Israeli officer walks around a campsite at the festival near Re’im kibbutz on October 17\n‘The scariest thing for me was running in a certain direction – thinking that you’re running to safety – and then suddenly seeing dozens of other kids running in your direction and realizing that they’re running from a terrorist, that they are running from shooting.’\nDestroyed cars are seen at the party site near the Kibbutz Re’im on Tuesday, October 10, 2023\n‘The only time we had someone near us to guide us was about two hours in. We saw a police officer and his direction was to go in the direction of the sun. That was the direction the town was in.’\nThe police officer walked with Natalie and her group for a while, armed only with a handgun. He explained he could not call for backup because Hamas had taken over the nearby police station. Over the radio, ‘you could hear the terrorists yelling’.\nThey could only keep moving.\n‘There was just an exodus of hundreds and hundreds of kids walking in the same direction. And then every time we heard gunshots, some people ran this way, some people ran that way.\n‘You’re in an open field and there’s almost nowhere to hide. It felt hopeless. It really felt hopeless. There’s just simply nowhere to hide, there was nowhere to go. There’s stories of some people that hid in drains, in trees and fields. A lot of those people… they ended up finding them and killing most of them.\n‘The ones that survived were the ones that hid under the dead bodies and pretended to be dead.’\nExhausted, Natalie’s group eventually stopped to rest in the shade of a tree. Four hours had passed and they were still miles from the nearest town, an endless journey with no way to know how far they had gone.\nAs they paused, they saw a large white van coming towards them.\n‘At first we thought it might be a terrorist so we fought to get up and run… but then we realised, “where would we run to? What would we do?”‘\nThe group could only wait by the side of the road. The vehicle pulled up and a man got out.\nHe offered them a lift. They still had an hour to go.\nVehicles were abandoned after security guards told attendees to leave their cars and run\nFleeing for their lives, people had no time to react when told the abandon their cars and run.

I couldn’t believe that these people were going out of their way to risk their lives to save all of us. If that man didn’t come with his car, I don’t think I would be here today.\n‘It’s very hard for me to comprehend these stories that I am seeing now, every day, someone else that was kidnapped, that their friends and family had a little bit of hope that maybe they are still alive. Every day people are posting that they have been found dead.’\nNatalie and her friends were fortunate to escape to Patish, a nearby moshav. There, she says the town came together to help those still flooding in.\n‘They gave us food. They gave us shelter. We hid in their bomb shelters.’\nShe described the horror parents were undergoing all the while as they acted quickly to take in more children.\n‘When the rockets started going off, all the children there were messaging their parents, telling them what was happening. To tell them that they were safe and trying to escape.\n‘Many people, after a while, couldn’t get in touch with their kids anymore. Either their kids were kidnapped or killed. So a lot of people in the town were receiving lists of names of people that were at the festival that… weren’t answering their family and friends anymore.\n‘And they were walking around reading off lists of names hoping that maybe somebody was saved and maybe somebody was in the shelter and then they could inform their families that they are okay.’\nNatalie managed to get in touch with her mother, who lives in New York.\n‘I honestly did not tell my mom where I was until after I got home safe because I couldn’t stand the idea of her worrying about me about my life that way.’\nSoon after, Natalie made plans to return home, coming home via Athens. There, she contacted the press, feeling she needed to share her story.\nShe said there is now nowhere she feels entirely safe, amid heightened reports of antisemitism globally. Anti-Jewish threats on Telegram surged 488 percent in the first 18 hours after Hamas’ incursion, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThe first four days of the conflict also saw anti-Semitic incidents in the United Kingdom surge by more than 300 percent, according to Community Security Trust.\n‘I have a lot of friends in New York right now who are afraid to leave their homes,’ Natalie said. ‘I had a friend who tried to call an Uber and the Uber driver messaged her and asked her, “Are you Jewish?” And then said, “If you are, I will kill you.”\n‘It doesn’t feel safe to be anywhere right now. The fact that I’m not in Israel doesn’t make me feel safe.\n‘I’m incredibly scared for what’s to come. Because everything that has happened so far is not the end it is only going to get worse and that’s what scares me the most.’\nIn spite of all she has gone through, Natalie’s message to the world is to avoid the conflict descending into further unnecessary factional violence. She says she wants people to ‘understand that we have the same common enemy’ in Hamas, as distinct from the Palestinian people.\n‘[Hamas] is a terrorist organization that does not care though about the lives of Palestinian people, or any people,’ she said. ‘We have to come together against this common enemy.’\n‘I am seeing a lot of support online from a lot of countries, from a lot of governments, from a lot of people I know personally, from people I don’t know personally. But I think there is still a lot of confusion as to who Hamas is, what they are doing.\n‘Especially as an Iranian Jew, just a year ago the Iranian government was killing innocent children in their own streets. And I feel that a lot of Iranians even don’t realize that we are fighting against the same people. We need to come together and realize that we have the same common enemy.’\n‘I also want people to understand the fear that Jews are feeling all over the world, whether it’s in London or Paris, or New York, or Israel.\n‘The things that I’m seeing that are happening in New York – I don’t actually feel safe going home,’ she said.\n‘Everyone keeps telling me “it’s so great that you’re almost back in New York, you’re almost home”. But I don’t feel safe going back to New York.\n‘And that’s the scariest part. That’s the saddest part – that I don’t feel safe.’",

Edward ‘Jembe’ Chirwa made the remarks at Chipumulo in the area of Traditional Authority (T/A) Kampingo Sibande in Mzimba recently during the burial ceremony of Eliness Magompho who died at Mzuzu Central Hospital (MCH) after succumbing to a battle of low sugar disease. During the ceremony, relatives to the deceased buried some precious items like blankets, mats among others as a sign of respect and love. In his eulogy , Group Village Headman (GVH) Chibwana Nyangu said in Magompho, the community had lost “a real Christian and a mother group leader in the quest for right to education for victims of early child marriages hence she deserved the respect, love and a decent send off. “No words can describe the depth of our shock and sadness at the heart-breaking news” GVH Chibwana Nyangu said. But Jembe Chirwa addressing hundreds of mourners said elsewhere he also witnessed relatives took new mattresses, blankets and buried with the dead leaving children suffering with no mat to sleep on neither blanket to cover themselves during this cold weather, prompting other well-wishers to render support, hence he felt duty bound to voice out to the masses to get a lesson from. “When something goes wrong, we have to speak out. We are civic educators and we have to say it for the sake of people to learn a lesson from,” Rev. Jembe Chirwa said. But when we sought views from a historian and a cultural man of the Ngoni ethnic group, Aupson Ndabazake Thole, who is also the Secretary for Esangweni Elders Association(EEA) within Mzimba Heritage Association (MZIHA) of the M’mbelwa Chief Council, he defended the deceased family including friends for their action, saying that burying someone with items, is an old culture as old kings like Pharaohs were buried with precious items that they used. Thole noted that the culture which was practiced in many African ethnic groups has high sense of attachment to ancestral spirits such as sense of belonging and sense of collectivism, so when one dies, the living are afraid of the unknown hence the dead need to be buried with respect and love. He said, as a result they try to appease the spirit of the dead. Said Thole: “Apart from appeasement, everybody is suspicious that if we leave the items like blankets that the dead person used when he was ill, who is going to use them? Adding that the living don’t share items with the dead. The Ngoni cultural group spokesperson added that culture says the spirit of the dead shall be visiting you during the night. But, Thole, however said, It is not that all the items are buried with the dead but a few that the deceased used. These cannot be given to children because the ancestral spirit cannot accept.Follow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :",
