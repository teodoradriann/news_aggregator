    "text": "[News](https://ijr.com/news/) Massive Waves Hit California, Flooding Towns and Sparking Evacuations Powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean sent massive waves crashing into coastal towns along the California coast. According to [Fox 11 Los Angeles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWt1udFGhxo), several homes and businesses were damaged with people inside them. In addition, a lifeguard who was trying to rescue a surfer had to be pulled from the powerful waters just before a massive wave hit. Resident Kim Lamberg stated, “The biggest wave of the day came in and caught all of us off-guard because we weren’t paying attention to the ocean anymore, we were around a human.” “So anyways, it was really heavy. We left. We evacuated,” she added. Capt. Brian McGrath of the Ventura County Fire Department warned others to “stay away for your own safety, because these wave still are pretty high and can impact you if you’re not paying attention.” The [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2023/12/28/news/california-beach-towns-flooded-by-massive-waves-receive-evacuation-orders/) reported that 20 Pierpont beachgoers faced a towering wave that reached up to 20 feet tall in Ventura and eight people were reported injured. An evacuation warning was issued in Santa Cruz as well. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office warned residents of “high tides and flooding.” Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office information officer, Ashley Keehn, told KTVU FOX 2, “We put evacuation warnings into place around 8 a.m. this morning for this area, and, as you can see, these waves are incredibly powerful,” per the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2023/12/28/news/california-beach-towns-flooded-by-massive-waves-receive-evacuation-orders/). The National Weather Service reported that waves in the Bay area climbed as tall as 28 to 33 feet high causing catastrophic damage. WIPEOUT!

One important piece of this potentially happening is the star tight end, Travis Kelce.\nHowever, at 35 years old, there are rumors that Kelce could be contemplating retirement once the season concludes.\nDuring ESPN's \"First Take,\" analyst Dan Orlovsky thought it was a real possibility under certain conditions.\n\"Kelce's more than capable of being the difference maker,\" he said. \"I think he's got one great run left. I think if he goes and has that Vintage Kelce performance...and they go on to three-peat, I think retirement becomes a very real thing for Travis Kelce.\"\n.\n— First Take (@FirstTake)[@danorlovsky7]says Travis Kelce has \"one great run left\" in his NFL career\n\"If he goes and has that vintage Kelce performance ... and [the Chiefs] go on to three-peat, I think retirement becomes a very real thing.\"[pic.twitter.com/SVEWmohH4r][January 16, 2025]\nIf Orlovsky were right, then Kelce would be considered a lock for the Hall of Fame, as he already has 1,004 receptions, 12,151 yards and 77 touchdowns.\nHe's also been named First-Team All-Pro four times, made 10 Pro Bowl teams, and played a key role in all three of his Super Bowl wins.\nHowever, he has not confirmed if retirement will happen, but recently on \"The Stephen A. Smith Show,\" he admitted that he would reevaluate things after the season and that his girlfriend Taylor Swift has encouraged him to continue playing.\nRelated: Rob Gronkowski Backtracks, Picks New AFC Team to Make Super Bowl LIX\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.

    "text": "( MENAFN - KNN India) New Delhi, Jul 5 (KNN) A four-day Global Conclave on Plastic Recycling and Sustainability (GCPRS) commenced Thursday at Bharat Mandapam, Pragati Maidan, focusing on addressing the global challenge of plastic waste management.\nThe event, jointly organised by the All India Plastics Manufacturers Association (AIPMA) and the Chemicals & Petrochemicals Manufacturers' Association (CPMA), brings together industry leaders, start-ups, and environmental experts to discuss innovative solutions and sustainable practices.\nNivedita Shukla Verma, Secretary, Chemicals and Fertilisers, inaugurated the conclave, highlighting the plastic industry's significant economic contributions while acknowledging the need for sustainable practices.\nVerma noted that only 10 per cent of plastic waste globally is currently recycled, emphasising the urgency for collaborative efforts to address this issue.\nThe Indian government's initiatives, including the Plastic Waste Management Rules introduced in 2016 and subsequent amendments, were outlined as steps towards curbing plastic pollution.\nThese measures mandate extended producer responsibility and enforce stricter recycling standards.\nMercy Epao, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), expressed support for the cause and announced plans to establish a state-of-the-art export centre in Hyderabad, encouraging stakeholders to utilise benefits extended by the ministry.\nIndia's plastic recycling industry, projected to reach USD 6.9 billion by 2033, boasts a current recycling rate of approximately 60 per cent.\nThe conclave aims to address critical issues in plastic waste management and explore sustainable alternatives such as biodegradable and compostable plastics.\nThe event features an exhibition showcasing innovative recycling technologies and efficient waste management solutions.\nA CEO-level roundtable and panel discussions on plastic waste recycling in various industries are also scheduled.\nAs environmental regulations tighten globally, the conclave serves as a platform for dialogue and collaboration among value chain participants and governments to develop effective solutions for plastic waste management and promote a sustainable circular economy.\n(KNN Bureau)\nMENAFN05072024000155011030ID1108409751",

    "title": "Trump pede que justiça atrase sentença de condenação em Nova York para depois das eleições",
    "text": "Os advogados de Donald Trump pediram à justiça que adie o anúncio da sentença do magnata para depois das eleições de novembro, após ele ter sido condenado por ocultar pagamentos para comprar o silêncio de uma ex-atriz pornô. Todd Blanche argumenta que a data prevista para o anúncio, 18 de setembro, não dá tempo suficiente para Trump possivelmente apelar do resultado de uma outra audiência marcada para 16 de setembro, esta sobre imunidade presidencial e decorrente de um julgamento da Suprema Corte americana. Em uma carta enviada ao juiz na quarta-feira (14), Blanche também afirmou que \"não há base para continuar se apressando\", além dos não especificados \"objetivos espúrios de interferência eleitoral\". Em maio, Trump foi declarado culpado por um júri de Nova York de 34 acusações de falsificação de documentos contábeis para encobrir pagamentos com o objetivo de comprar o silêncio da ex-atriz de filmes adultos Stormy Daniels e evitar que ela revelasse um suposto caso extraconjugal. Trump é o primeiro ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos a ser condenado criminalmente. \"A sentença está atualmente programada para ser anunciada quando a votação antecipada das eleições presidenciais já tiver sido iniciada\", escreveu Blanche ao tribunal. \"Adiando a sentença até depois desta eleição... O Tribunal reduziria, embora não eliminasse, as questões relativas à integridade de qualquer procedimento futuro\", acrescentou. Na quarta-feira, Trump falhou pela terceira vez em seu esforço para afastar o juiz responsável pelo caso. Os advogados do magnata e atual candidato republicano à Presidência nas eleições de 5 de novembro haviam solicitado a remoção do juiz Juan Merchan alegando que o trabalho de sua filha para uma organização democrata representa um \"conflito de interesse\". Mas Merchan rejeitou o pedido ao considerar que os argumentos da defesa não passam de uma \"repetição de alegações desgastadas e infundadas\". Trump tem tentado de todas as formas atrasar os diferentes casos que enfrenta perante a justiça até depois das eleições presidenciais, incluindo os de Washington e do estado da Geórgia, onde é acusado de tentar reverter os resultados da eleição de 2020, nas quais foi derrotado pelo democrata Joe Biden, cuja vitória o magnata republicano nunca reconheceu. gw/mlm/af/jb/mvv © Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "O Arsenal decepcionou a sua torcida nesta quinta-feira ao ser derrotado em seu estádio por 2 a 0 pelo West Ham, no encerramento da 19ª rodada do Campeonato Inglês. O tropeço custou caro, já que o revés tirou a chance de o time do técnico Mikel Arteta assumir a liderança da competição.\nNa classificação, a diferença para o líder Liverpool é agora de dois pontos (40 a 42). O West Ham festejou o triunfo e também a posição na classificação. Os visitantes somam 33 pontos e aparecem no sexto posto, logo atrás do Tottenham, que também perdeu seu compromisso na rodada.\nAs duas equipes voltam a jogar pelo torneio no próximo final de semana. O Arsenal vai tentar a reabilitação visitando o Fulham no domingo. Na terça-feira, o West Ham recebe o Brighton no estádio Olímpico de Londres.\nO resultado surpreendente começou a ser construído ainda no início do primeiro tempo. Jarrod Bowen faz uma bela assistência para Tomas Soucek, que teve frieza para dominar e chutar forte: 1 a 0, aos 13 minutos.\nCom a necessidade de virar o jogo e a pressão da torcida, a partida foi ficando dramática. O West Ham perdeu Lucas Paquetá com 30 minutos de confronto. A baixa obrigou a equipe visitante a se fechar ainda mais a fim de segurar a vantagem. Com mais volume de jogo, mas sem ser efetivo, o Arsenal foi para o intervalo sem conseguir o empate.\nQuem esperava uma pressão total da equipe de Mikel Arteta desde o início, acabou se surpreendendo. O West Ham se aproveitou de uma bola aérea e fez o que poucos acreditavam: aumentou a vantagem para 2 a 0 em cabeçada de Mavropanos. A bola ainda bateu no travessão antes de entrar, aos 10 minutos.\nO Arsenal foi para cima, criou seguidas chances, mas pecou nas finalizações. Em dois lances praticamente seguidos, Gabriel Jesus perdeu dois gols na pequena área. No primeiro cabeceio, Aréola defendeu. Na segunda oportunidade, o camisa nove cabeceou por cima.\nO tempo passou a ser mais um adversário e o Arsenal não conseguiu se organizar diante de um rival retrancado. Ödegaard ainda teve outra chance em cabeçada nos acréscimos mas parou no goleiro. O pior quase aconteceu no último lance do jogo com um pênalti anotado para o West Ham. David Raya, no entanto, conseguiu defender a cobrança de Benrahma garantindo a derrota de 2 a 0.",

    "title": "Foreigner climbs onto FamilyMart roof in Shibuya; yells 'I did it!' before police step in - Japan Today",
    "text": "With foreign visitors to Japan at an all-time high, there have also been more incidents where people from overseas have been behaving badly, giving rise to a new term being used in the local media: meiwaku gaikokujin .\nTranslating as “nuisance foreigner,\" this term pops up whenever a non-Japanese individual acts out in public, breaking rules and disrespecting the local culture. We’ve seen it used by media when foreigners gathered in great numbers at a Mount Fuji Lawson, and today it’s also become a hot topic, this time in relation to another convenience store — FamilyMart.\nThis “Nuisance Foreigner” incident took place at the FamilyMart in Udagawa-cho near Shibuya Center Gai in Tokyo.\nConvenience stores are an iconic part of Japanese daily life that draw foreign visitors like moths to a light, but on the night of Aug 7, this individual went one step further by actually climbing up to the roof above the brightly lit signboard and squatting in front of the windows of the Shakey’s Pizza joint above the convenience store. With the lights out inside Shakey’s at the time, the incident would’ve occurred sometime after it closed at 9:30 p.m.\nEyewitness reports say the man, who was wearing a white T-shirt, climbed onto a signboard at ground level in order to access the roof, but as he was unable to climb onto it, his friend assisted by pushing another signboard alongside it, where he also climbed up to join him. His friend, wearing a black T-shirt, then squatted to give the man in a white T-shirt a lift on his shoulders, allowing him to climb onto the roof.\nAt this time, a staff member came out of the store and gestured to them to get down, but they ignored his requests, with the man and his friend yelling out something like “I did it!” or “We did it!” Their triumph was short-lived, though, as the cheers turned to calls of “Get down, get down!” and “Police are on their way!” as the friend on ground level spotted police officers approaching. The man on the roof didn’t make it down before officers arrived, though, and so he and his friend, along with another friend in a white T-shirt, who’d likely been taking photos from across the street, had to face the police.\n▼ Video of the incident.\nWhile verbal warnings were issued by police, it’s unclear whether further action will be taken. One thing that is for certain is the fact that these “nuisance foreigners” are giving all foreigners a bad reputation in Japan, where formality, restraint and consideration for others is part of what makes the nation so appealing to visitors.\nThese values form the basis for wa , a concept at the heart of Japanese culture that literally translates as “peace” or “harmony” but is so tied in with the Japanese way of thinking that it’s also used interchangeably to mean “Japan.\" It’s the reason why people refrain from saying what they really think, consider others above themselves, and prioritise the group above all else — all in the name of maintaining wa or “harmony” with others.\nThis ethos is in direct opposition to the actions of meiwaku gaikokujin , angering locals who toe the line in their everyday lives. The flouncing of rules by foreigners is often accompanied by another term, yaritai hodai , which literally translates as “doing what you like as much as you like“, another selfish trait that flies in the face of Japanese morals. So next time you’re in Japan and think it’s a good idea to climb onto the roof of a convenience store for a photo, you might want to take a moment to think like a local and refrain from doing what you want, for the sake of others around you.\nSource: FNN via Yahoo!

    "title": "Nikki Haley stumped by trick question: What was the cause of the Civil War? - Augusta Free Press",
    "text": "[Nikki Haley](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/nikki-haley/), supposedly getting traction in New Hampshire, stepped on her own, whatever, tripped up by a hard question from what she seems to think is a Democratic plant. The hard question: what was the cause of the United States Civil War? Some mean trick, asking that question. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do,” Haley answered at a Wednesday town hall, afraid to say the quiet part out loud, because, you know, woke. Seriously, she was afraid if she said the obvious part out loud – that the Civil War was fought, not over “freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do,” but over slavery – she might offend the MAGA base, which is damn sick and tired of this wokeness nonsense. And then, she stepped on, you know, her whatever a second time, telling a New Hampshire radio host on Thursday that “of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s the easy part of it. “ Did you see what she did there? After so obviously kowtowing to the far right in her first answer, she conceded the woke point, losing the MAGAs in the process, while not exactly endearing herself to the rest of the electorate – defined as, those among us who don’t tingle up at thoughts of the Reichstag burning to the ground. She tried to straddle the line with this word salad: “What I was saying was, what does it mean us today?” Haley said. “What it means to us today is about freedom. That’s what that was all about. It was about individual freedom, economic freedom, individual rights. Our goal is to make sure we never go back to the stain of slavery, but what’s the lesson in all of that?” Even [Ron DeSantis](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/ron-desantis/), the dark knight of anti-woke, piled on at this stage. “Not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War, and yet that seemed to be something that was really difficult,” DeSantis said. “I don’t even know what she was saying. If you listen to that answer, I know she’s trying to clean it up, I know she’s trying to blame a Democrat plant. Look, I mean, you’re going to get asked a lot of questions, I mean, you’re gonna get asked a lot of tough questions. That’s just the nature of this business. And I think that she’s shown time and time again that when it’s time, when the lights get hot, that she wilts under pressure.” It’s not a good day when DeSanctimonious is dunking on you. Noticeably silent through all of this: [Donald Trump](https://augustafreepress.com/tag/donald-trump/). The sound you hear is him thumbing through his crayon-annotated Mein Kampf, searching desperately for the section on what the Civil War was about.",

    "text": "Zweite Erde? Hoffnungen um potenziellen Erdzwilling Trappist-1 d werden enttäuscht\nDie Suche nach einer zweiten Erde konzentrierte sich auf das Trappist-1-System. Nun zeigen neue Daten des „James Webb“-Teleskops ein unerwartetes Ergebnis.\nMontréal – Wenn es um Planeten außerhalb unseres Sonnensystems geht, auf denen es möglicherweise Leben geben könnte, dann fällt immer ein Name: „Trappist-1“. Dabei handelt es sich um einen roten Zwergstern, der nur etwa 40 Lichtjahre von der Erde entfernt ist und von sieben Planeten umkreist wird, die etwa erdgroß sind. Mehrere dieser Planeten befinden sich in der sogenannten „habitablen Zone“ des Sterns – das heißt, auf ihnen herrschen Temperaturen, die flüssiges Wasser an der Oberfläche möglich machen.\nDeshalb gilt das „Trappist-1“-System als die größte Hoffnung bei Forschenden, eine „zweite Erde“ im Universum zu finden. Seit das „James Webb“-Weltraumteleskop aktiv ist, kann die Forschungsgemeinschaft die „Trappist-1“-Planeten genauer untersuchen und mehr über sie herausfinden. Dabei steht vor allem eine Frage im Vordergrund: Haben die Planeten in der habitablen Zone Atmosphären?\nSuche nach einer zweiten Erde: Der Exoplanet Trappist-1 d ist es wohl nicht\n„Letztendlich möchten wir wissen, ob es irgendwo anders etwas Ähnliches wie die Umwelt gibt, die wir auf der Erde genießen, und unter welchen Bedingungen dies möglich ist“, sagt Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb (University of Chicago und Université de Montréal in einer Nasa-Mitteilung. „Während das ‚James Webb‘-Weltraumteleskop der Nasa uns erstmals die Möglichkeit gibt, diese Frage bei erdähnlichen Planeten zu untersuchen, können wir Trappist-1 d zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt von der Liste potenzieller Erdzwillinge oder -cousins ausschließen.“ Die Forschungsergebnisse wurden im Fachmagazin The Astrophysical Journal veröffentlicht.\nDer Planet Trappist-1 d ist aus der Sicht des Sterns der dritte Planet und befindet sich am Rand der habitablen Zone. Er benötigt nur vier Erdtage, um den Stern einmal zu umrunden. Mithilfe des NIRSpec-Instruments des Weltraumteleskops hat das Forschungsteam nach Molekülen Ausschau gehalten, die in der Erdatmosphäre vorkommen – beispielsweise Wasser, Methan oder Kohlendioxid. Gefunden wurden jedoch keine.\n„Webb“-Teleskop entdeckt keine Atmosphäre bei Trappist-1 d\nFür das Forschungsteam gibt es verschiedene Gründe, warum um Trappist-1 d keine Atmosphäre entdeckt wurde, wie Piaulet-Ghorayeb erklärt: „Er könnte eine extrem dünne Atmosphäre haben, die schwer zu erkennen ist, ähnlich wie auf dem Mars. Alternativ könnte es sehr dichte Wolken in großer Höhe geben, die unsere Erkennung bestimmter atmosphärischer Signaturen blockieren – eher wie auf der Venus. Oder es könnte sich um einen kargen Felsen ohne jegliche Atmosphäre handeln.“\nAllerdings befindet sich Trappist-1 d auch in einem Umfeld, das es schwer macht, eine Atmosphäre dauerhaft zu halten: Rote Zwergsterne sind bekannt dafür, dass sie sehr aktiv sind. Sie schleudern häufig Materie und hochenergetische Strahlung ins Weltall, die die Atmosphäre von kleinen Planeten wegreißen kann – vor allem, wenn die Planeten sich nahe an dem Stern befinden, wie es Trappist-1 d tut. Rote Zwergsterne sind jedoch auch die am häufigsten vorkommenden Sterne in unserer Galaxie, weshalb die Forschung hofft, Planeten zu finden, die im Orbit um einen roten Zwerg ihre Atmosphäre halten können.\nHaben die anderen Trappist-1-Planeten vielleicht Atmosphären?\n„Wir stehen noch ganz am Anfang, wenn es darum geht, mit ‚Webb‘ nach Atmosphären auf erdähnlichen Planeten zu suchen und die Grenze zwischen Planeten, die eine Atmosphäre halten können, und solchen, die dies nicht können, zu definieren“, betont Co-Autor Björn Benneke. Die Beobachtung der äußeren „Trappist-1“-Planeten mit dem „Webb“-Teleskop läuft derzeit. Wie das Ergebnis aussehen könnte, ist noch unklar. Auf der einen Seite sind die Planeten e, f, g und h weiter vom Stern entfernt – es könnte ihnen also etwas leichter fallen, ihre potenziellen Atmosphären zu halten.\nDurch ihre größere Entfernung vom Stern sind sie jedoch auch etwas kühler, was es dem Weltraumteleskop schwerer macht, atmosphärische Signaturen aufzuspüren. „Die Hoffnung für die Atmosphären der Trappist-1-Planeten ist noch nicht verloren“, muntert Piaulet-Ghorayeb auf. „Auch wenn wir auf Planet d keine deutlichen atmosphärischen Signaturen gefunden haben, besteht dennoch die Möglichkeit, dass die äußeren Planeten viel Wasser und andere atmosphärische Komponenten enthalten.“ (tab)",

    "text": "(Shenandoah) -- Despite a raging winter storm, life--and in some cases, the beginning of life--goes on. Many KMAland residents still had to do their jobs, regardless of the heavy snow and bone-chilling winds hitting the region. That includes a Shenandoah Medical Center physician forced to use alternative transportation to get to the hospital in time to deliver a baby. Dr. Chase Brown is a family practitioner at SMC. Brown lives in a rural area several minutes away from the hospital. With heavy snowdrifts forming on secondary roads, Brown tells KMA News he rode to the hospital on an ATV in order to make the delivery in time. \"Sometimes, the best way for me to get to the hospital is on my 4-wheeler,\" said Brown. \"Knowing that the storm is coming in--I actually got stuck on Tuesday in my regular vehicle--so I felt like the safest way to get into the hospital was to bundle up. Sure enough, I definitely would've gotten stuck again had I not taken my 4-wheeler. \"I just made it in early, took my time--that was the best way to get here. But, it was definitely necessary,\" he added. Even with a 4-wheeler, Brown says maneuvering around the snow-covered roads was an adventure. \"Very high snow drifts,\" he said. \"There's a few snow drifts where it felt like there were as tall as my 4-wheeler driving in. So, I had to hit some of those at speeds so where it didn't slow me down, and didn't get stuck. Nothing where it felt like it was throwing me off the road, but there several significant snow drifts that were pretty high.\" Weather notwithstanding, Brown says it was important to arrive at SMC in time for the baby delivery. \"It's one of those scenarios where it couldn't wait,\" said Brown. \"You can't tell the mom to hold the baby in when the baby needs to come, right? We had to get this delivery done today to make sure this mom and baby were safe, happy and healthy.\" The baby arrived at around 8:30 Friday morning--both mother and infant are reported in good condition. Brown credits his partner, Dr. Martee MacLeod-Kozal and the hospital's OR staff for helping with the birth. He also thanks his neighbors for clearing a space for him to get his ATV on the road.",
