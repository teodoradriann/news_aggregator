    "title": "Caos, gritos y empujones entre la seguridad de Wanda Nara y la prensa durante un evento: \"No pueden actuar así\" - Infobae",
    "text": "En medio de su llegada al pub, Wanda Nara y sus hijas vivieron un tenso momento con los cronistas de diferentes programas (Video: Puro Show – El Trece) Mientras Mauro Icardi y la China Suárez disfrutan de su viaje por Europa, en el otro extremo del mapa, Wanda Nara y L-Gante siguen alimentando rumores y consolidando su imagen como pareja. En esta ocasión, la empresaria asistió junto a sus hijas, Francesca e Isabella , fruto de su relación con el futbolista, a la fiesta de lanzamiento de la nueva canción del artista en colaboración con Belén Gal . Lo que prometía ser una noche de celebración y música, sin embargo, terminó envuelto en tensión debido a un inesperado cruce con la prensa .\nEn su salida del pub, los noteros intentaron interactuar con Wanda, pero ella se mantuvo cabizbaja y evadió las consultas. “ ¿No vas a hablar, Wanda? No, no va a hablar. Y si bajás de la camioneta tranquila y charlamos… ”, le consultó uno, a lo que ella le contestó: “ No puedo, están las chicas solas ”. En un intento por obtener otro tipo de respuesta, el enviado de Puro Show (El Trece), Alejandro Castelo , lanzó: “ ¿Te duele que te cuestionen así? ”.\nTan solo unos segundos más tarde se comenzó a escuchar una acalorada discusión parte de la prensa y la seguridad que acompañaba a la conductora . Una de las voces que resaltó fue la de Alejandro Guatti de Intrusos (América), quien expresó: “ No pueden actuar así, estamos en la calle ”. En un intento de narrar la situación que se estaba llevando adelante, Castelo acotó: “ Nosotros frenamos un poco acá porque tampoco está bueno que suceda un esto y es caótica la salida . Wanda dice que no va a hablar porque están las nenas, pero estaba la posibilidad si no estaban. Esto se podía haber evitado. Dijimos que ni levantamos la cámara ni preguntamos ”.\nAcompañada de sus hijas, Wanda intentó evadir a los cronistas que la esperaban a la salida (RS FOTOS) Lejos de darse por vencidos, los medios le siguieron los pasos a Nara, quien parecía decidida a no dar detalles de su vida personal. Pero, ante los conflictos que se generaban a su alrededor, expresó: “ Simplemente otro día hablamos. No se peleen ”. Acto seguido, una serie de insultos a raíz de los conflictos con sus custodios y los camarógrafos se llevó el protagonismo de la toma y dejó en evidencia la acalorada situación que se generaba por la actitud de la animadora. Ella, en un intento de minimizar lo que ocurría, exclamó: “ ¡Yo no tengo nada que ver! No tengo nada para decir ”.\nA metros de su vehículo, Wanda cambió de actitud y respondió algunas consultas de Alejandro . “ Se te cuestiona mucho como mamá, ¿vos querés responder algo a eso? ”. Con frialdad, ella le contestó: “ No tengo nada para decir. Los únicos que me pueden cuestionar son mis cinco hijos ”. A su vez, aseguró que esas declaraciones no le dolían y que no le hacía “caso a la gente que habla con mala intención y no me conoce”. También intentó indagar en la tenencia de sus hijas, quienes se encuentran en medio de su batalla legal con Icardi, a lo que ella aseguró: “ No tengo nada para decir. Chicos, ya me conocen hace muchos años, desde muy chiquita. Está todo bien y con los abogados ya pudimos aclarar muchas cosas ”.\nAnte los incidentes entre su custodia y los cronistas, Wanda respondió algunas consultas (RS Fotos) Y, respecto a cómo se llevará a cabo el régimen de tenencia compartida entre las nenas, la animadora limitó sus palabras. “ No tengo idea. Ustedes saben más que yo ”, sentenció, mientras subía a su camioneta y dejaba detrás de sí misma una escena donde los forcejeos y empujones hacia los periodistas se robaban el protagonismo de la escena.\nLa noche, que había comenzado como una simple celebración, terminó convertida en una escena de tensión y reproches . Nara, firme en su decisión de no dar explicaciones sobre su vida privada, dejó atrás un torbellino de preguntas sin respuesta y miembros de la prensa, entre encontronazos y reclamos , intentaban captar una declaración que nunca llegó. Mientras tanto, el revuelo mediático en torno a su relación con el músico, su enfrentamiento con Mauro y la disputa por la tenencia de sus hijas sigue sumando capítulos. Afuera, las cámaras se apagaban, pero el escándalo ya estaba servido .",

    "title": "Why Britain is the place to invest in 2024: Experts tip 'screamingly cheap' UK stocks",
    "text": "Have you heard about the 3D reset? Do you know which stock market is ‘screamingly cheap’? Does a nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio loom large in your stock-picking strategy? If you have resolved to take a cold hard look at your portfolio in the new year, these are themes tipped to determine the direction of markets in 2024. There may be more heartening news about inflation and interest rates. But some analysts argue that economies have yet to feel the full impact of the higher borrowing costs imposed in 2023 – meaning that recession may be still be a threat in Britain and America. Against this background, it may be tempting to wait for the all-clear signal. But, as James Thomson of Rathbones points out, ‘that will never come, and often the best returns come when you least expect them.’ If you believe that fortune favours the brave, these are the themes that you cannot afford to ignore in 2024. Bargain Britain: The FTSE All Share index has risen by just 1.7% over the past 12 months but many experts say UK stocks are currently undervalued Alex Tedder and Tom Wilson, the global and emerging strategists at Schroders, say investors should be aware of what they call the ‘3D reset’ which will increasingly influence the mood of stock markets. This is made up of three factors: demographic constraints; decarbonisation imperatives and deglobalisation initiatives. These have created supply bottlenecks, driven up wage costs, boosted inflation and underpinned populism. In the face of these challenges, investors would be well advised to change their mindset, focusing more on diversification in particular, rather than relying on US tech that dominates many portfolios. Tedder and Wilson do not suggest that you bid farewell to the US in 2024, since ‘its corporate sector remains, in aggregate, better managed and more innovative than pretty much any other.’ But they do recommend that you explore unloved markets, such as Japan and the UK. Diversification is difficult, but Russ Mould of AJ Bell says that paying attention to certain themes can help you determine ‘which way the wind is blowing’ and to re-align your portfolio. In 2024, analysts will, as always, be carefully monitoring the prices of oil and of copper – ‘a reliable indicator of global economic health due to its many uses.’ But they will also be keeping a close eye on an ever-more important metric – a country’s debt-to-GDP. If this ratio approaches 20 per cent, this should serve as an alert. China and France are already in this position, but America’s $1 trillion-a-year spending is bringing it into the danger zone. US markets are pricing in five rate cuts in 2024. Mould argues that, if these cuts fail to materialise, this could imperil the $11.8 trillion combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven. Mould also cites another key theme: the yield curve for government bonds which reflects the market sentiment about risk. The yield curve is ‘inverted’, that is the yields on ten-year UK gilt-edged stocks and US bonds are lower than those on two-year bonds. The reverse should be the case with longer-term bonds offering a higher yield, as compensation for the possibility that catastrophe could arise at some point in their longer lifespan. Investing legend: Warren Buffett American markets have flourished in 2023, ending the year in style with the three major indices – the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – rising for seven straight weeks. Boosting share prices has been the hope that interest rates will move downward in 2024. There are also hopes that the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will continue to flourish, as the artificial intelligence boom continues to gather strength. But the analysts at UBS are also tipping Boeing, Coca-Cola, Domino’s Pizza, Merck, Visa and Ulta Beauty, amid the belief that the search for beauty is a theme in any year. Another enduring theme is never betting against America – which has sustained billionaire Warren Buffett, pictured, for more than six decades. Mould suggests that you watch wage settlements, given their impact on inflation. The Bank of England is predicted to cut interest rates early in the new year, following the surprise drop in the inflation rate to 3.9 per cent. But the Bank seems unwilling to make a move until pay rises moderate. These issues mean that you will hear many analysts talk about ‘a scarcity of certainty’. But this is likely to raise the profile of what Thomson calls ‘recession-resistant stocks that can survive in any economic cycle.’ He includes in this category such diverse companies as discount retailer Costco, with its loyal and growing client base and Hermes, maker of exclusive handbags. Diversification involves embracing the high and the low. Experts are declaring that the UK is the place to invest in 2024. This claim will be greeted with some cynicism by those who backed Britain in 2023 and were sorely disappointed. The FTSE All Share index has risen by just 1.7 per cent over the past 12 months which looks distinctly unimpressive compared with the 24.6 per cent increase in the irrepressible S&P 500. But the conviction remains that the UK is ‘screamingly cheap’, according to Matthew Bennison, of Schroder Income Growth fund. He is boosting his British holdings, taking the view that they will fare well over a three-year horizon. Simon Gergel, manager of the Merchants investment trust, also contends that Britain is a bargain, saying that investors pay £10 for every pound of profit in the UK compared with $20 for every dollar of profit in the US. The belief that British business is on offer at a discount lies behind the continuing wave of foreign takeovers of UK companies. Last month the mighty Mars corporation gobbled up Hotel Chocolat, maker of the Sleekster and other indulgences, in a £524million deal. News of the takeover sent Hotel Chocolat shares soaring by 160 per cent. This underlines the gap between our perception of our home-grown firms and the view in some quarters of Wall Street that they are the equivalent of a Sleekster chocolate box at the price of a Milk Tray selection. However Pimco, the biggest US name in corporate bond, is betting that the UK is headed for a hard landing triggered by a delayed consumer reaction to higher interest rates. And angst over the outcome of Brexit lies behind the undervaluation of UK shares. Some will still conclude the UK is cheap for a reason. But this could prove short-sighted when analysts at the US broker Jefferies are tipping Prudential and Standard Chartered as the shares to watch in 2024, forecasting that they could grow by 105 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. Mould is tipping GSK, the pharma giant (for the cautious) Legal & General (a balanced pick), Ashmore, the equipment supplier (a more adventurous selection) and insurance broker Lancashire (for income).",

    "title": "Sargent Park tennis courts now open free to the public | CTV News",
    "text": "The ball is now in the court of community members who wanted full access to tennis courts at Sargent Park. For the last 10 years, the Sargent Park Tennis Gardens had a deal with the city to operate and maintain the six courts. However, some in the community say the court's hours and fees are out of bounds. This week, a city committee decided not to renew the non-profit's lease agreement so members of the public can use the facility 24-7 for free under the city's operation. Coun. Cindy Gilroy and a group of local tennis enthusiasts convinced the property committee to not renew the lease. \"It really wasn't working out for the community,\" said Gilroy. \"It was cost prohibitive for many of our inner city residents and really, we wanted to have a place everyone could go.\" Jery Laforteza loves that the courts are now open to the public, saying he felt the $10 fee to use them was a barrier and the hours were too limited. \"Public (means) you have full access, anytime you want to play, anytime you want to leave, seven days a week. That's what I call public,\" said Laforteza. But the outgoing lessee worries the courts will now fall into disrepair. \"It will go downhill,\" said George Kylar with the Sargent Park Tennis Gardens. \"Will somebody go there if you have a windy day with leaves all over?\" He said the gate is locked off hours for security reasons and, he kept the courts swept and nets tight. He added the operation brought in big tennis tournaments. \"We made it so it looks like that you are almost arriving to the U.S. Open. So people come from everywhere.\" The community group and councillors in favour of ending the lease are promising the courts will get tender loving care, through volunteers, fundraising, and grants, if necessary. \"We'll find a way to keep that place clean, to make that place safe, to make that place playable,\" said Laforteza. The city's parks division estimates it will cost $5,000 a year to sweep the courts, replace the nets and paint the lines.

    "text": "Un estudio científico realizado por la\nNASA en conjunto con la Universidad de Tōhō de Japón determinó con gran precisión el momento en el que la vida dejará de ser posible en la Tierra.\nSegún simulaciones hechas con supercomputadoras, el responsable de este fin será el\nSol, cuya evolución inevitable impactará de manera irreversible en la atmósfera y las condiciones del planeta.\nLeé también:\nEstrellas, galaxias y nebulosas: el telescopio SPHEREx de la NASA envió sus primeras imágenes del espacio\nEl Sol, fuente esencial de energía para nuestro planeta, se encuentra actualmente en la fase principal de su ciclo vital, en la que transforma hidrógeno en helio mediante fusión nuclear. Sin embargo, esta etapa no es eterna: dentro de aproximadamente 5 mil millones de años, el\nhidrógeno comenzará a agotarse y la estrella se expandirá, convirtiéndose en una gigante roja.\nAunque el momento en el que este proceso final comience a desarrollarse está lejano, el estudio reveló que la vida en la Tierra dejará de ser viable mucho antes: las simulaciones indican que para el año 1.000.002.021 -es decir, dentro de 999.999.996 años- la atmósfera terrestre habrá cambiado tanto que el oxígeno será insuficiente para sostener la vida tal como la conocemos.\nLa expansión del Sol no solo afectará la atmósfera, sino que también alterará la temperatura y la radiación que recibe la\nTierra, y hacer imposible la existencia de ecosistemas estables. Eventualmente, la estrella se “comerá” a los planetas interiores del sistema solar, incluido el nuestro.\nEste cálculo convierte a la investigación en la estimación más precisa hasta la fecha sobre cuánto tiempo le queda a nuestro planeta para ser habitable.\nLeé también:\n El Hubble cumplió 35 años: estas son las mejores fotos del telescopio que abrió una ventana al universo\nSeñales tempranas y futuro de la exploración espacial\nAunque el fin está muy distante, los científicos señalan que ya se observan indicios de la evolución solar. En mayo de 2024, la\nNASA registró la tormenta solar más intensa en dos décadas, con consecuencias que impactaron la Tierra y alteraron sus campos magnéticos.\nAnte este panorama, la comunidad científica intensifica la búsqueda de planetas habitables fuera del sistema solar, con la esperanza de que en un futuro lejano la humanidad pueda encontrar un nuevo hogar.",

    "title": "Four things Mikel Arteta got wrong as West Ham stun Arsenal to stop them going top - Daily Star",
    "text": "[West Ham United ](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/west-ham-fc)defender Konstantinos Mavropanos came back to haunt [Arsenal](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) and knock his former side's [Premier League](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/premier-league) title challenge off course. Mavropanos, sold by the Gunners in 2020, headed the all-important second goal that helped the Hammers to a 3-0 victory. [Mikel Arteta's](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/mikel-arteta) side needed a victory to return to the top of the table, after [Liverpool eased past Burnley earlier in the week](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/what-jurgen-klopp-right-liverpool-31752151). However, [ they controversially fell behind](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/soucek-goal-var-ham-arsenal-31764601) in similar circumstances to their 1-0 loss to [Newcastle United](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/newcastle-united-fc), when Jarrod Bowen cut the ball back for Tomas Soucek to prod David Moyes' side into the lead. It was almost deja vu for the North Londoners, as they, yet again, waited for VAR to look at the goal and decide there was no conclusive evidence to rule it out. At the other end, Arsenal missed chance after chance as Bukayo Saka hit the post, and Gabriel Jesus missed two second half headers while unmarked in the penalty area. When things looked like they could not get any worse, Rice scythed down Emerson in the penalty area, but Said Benrahma's spot-kick was saved. After the Gunners fell to their third Premier League defeat of the season, Daily Star Sport considers what Arteta may have got wrong. READ MORE: [Luke Littler says 'it's crazy' as he is stopped by Arsenal's Rice and Ramsdale for picture](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/darts/darts-luke-littler-arsenal-football-31763358) READ MORE: ['I was an Arsenal scout for 15 years – Kylian Mbappe is my biggest disappointment'](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-scout-kylian-mbappe-transfer-31762637) All out attack Arteta certainly did not hold back in his team selection. He deployed Saka, Jesus, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard in a five-pronged attack against the Hammers. Considering the strengths of all players are attack-orientated, it looked like a team that was chasing a lead from the first moment. They constantly looked vulnerable to a [West Ham](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/west-ham-fc) counter-attack, particularly when Rice marauded forward every now and then. With Jorginho on the bench, Arteta may well have regretted not deploying another defensively astute midfielder alongside Rice. No Plan B Do you think Arsenal can win the Premier League this season? Let us know in the [comment section](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-mikel-arteta-west-ham-31764759#commentsection) below At times, Arsenal's football was magical - unfortunately for them, such magic will rarely get through a brick wall. Once the Hammers took the lead, they had at least eight players behind the ball at all times. However, [Arsenal](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) always looked to get through the blue wall by going straight through the middle of it, allowing the Hammers' back four to tuck-inside and plug every hole in their backline. The Gunners never looked to try and go on the outside of the congested Hammers backline, until after the Hammers doubled their lead. Arsenal have rarely been denied this season, but there does not appear to be a Plan B in their attacking play. Little variation Arsenal's frontline were pitted against a Hammers' backline featuring a defensive pairing of Angelo Ogbonna and Konstantinos Mavropanos. The defenders are Moyes' third and fourth choice centre-backs, who had never played alongside each other in the Premier League. However, you would not have known this as the pair looked rather comfortable against the North Londoners. Arsenal needed to test the understanding between the Italian and the Greek aces by whipping in crosses, playing in behind and getting the likes of Jesus and Martinelli to run in-between them. However, most of their attacks seemed to be in-front of the West Ham backline - exactly where Moyes would have wanted them. Not using their 12th man The biggest positive for the Gunners is that the 60,000 odd fans at the Emirates did not stop the whole game. Despite going 2-0 down, the Arsenal fans were always banging the drum or singing. Yet, Arteta, nor his players, did anything to harness this noise. The odd \"come on\" to the Arsenal fans would have added even more volume to a rapturous crowd. Every point is precious for the Gunners now. They need to encourage as much noise as possible if they are to go all the way in the title race.",
