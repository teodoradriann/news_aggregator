    "title": "An Innovative DIY Watch That You May Actually Want to Wear - Hackster.io",
    "text": "We’ve covered a lot of watch projects here on the Hackster blog. But, if we’re being honest, not many of them were designs that an average person would want to wear. Style and features are definitely factors, but bulk is arguably the biggest problem with DIY designs. The miniaturization needed to shove a bunch of tech into a tiny watch package requires resources that are out of the reach of most hobbyists. But Drfailov managed to pull it off and built this impressive ESP32-based watch that you may actually want to wear .\nDrfailov’s DRM Watch 3 looks fantastic. It is, admittedly, quite wide, but that’s a result of the screen Drfailov chose and that screen is what makes the watch so appealing. However, Drfailov’s packaging is extremely impressive and this watch is pretty darn slim. And it is a nice-looking watch that doesn’t at all give off “DIY” vibes — if we had told you that this was a consumer device that just hit the market, you would have believed us.\nThe key component is that awesome display, which is a 2.7” Sharp Memory Display that combines some of the best features of LCDs and e-ink displays. Sharp Memory Displays just recently started gaining traction in the maker community over the past couple of years. They use very little power and are quite readable in sunlight (like an e-ink display), but refresh at a fast rate (like an LCD). For devices that need to keep power consumption at a minimum without sacrificing refresh rate, they’re a great choice. They also have a distinct black-on-gray appearance that looks neat.\nMost Sharp Memory Displays, including this one, don’t have a backlight and so Drfailov had to add one. He made it using an electroluminescent panel cut to size to match the footprint of the display.\nThat display-backlight sandwich fits on top of the custom PCB that is densely packed with all of the components necessary to make the watch work. That includes, most importantly, an ESP32-S2 microcontroller. The ESP32-S2 has Wi-Fi for connecting to networks and Bluetooth for connecting to a user’s smartphone. Power comes from a 450mAh lithium battery and Drfailov says that it is good for about two weeks of use between charges.\nThe enclosure is 3D-printable, but the front panel can also be CNC-machined out of aluminum, steel, or more exotic metals for a premium appearance.\nwearables smartwatch Cameron Coward Follow Writer for Hackster News.

    "text": "Local Journalism Initiative John Howard Society dedicated to sheltering homeless during cold snap Read full article Local Journalism Initiative January 13, 2024 at 5:51 a.m. · 2 min read COLD LAKE - In the midst of the biting cold weather that has blanketed Cold Lake, the John Howard Society's services are proving to be a crucial refuge for those without a place to call home.\nWith temperatures plummeting in the –50C range with the windchill, and harsh winter conditions setting in, the shelter has opened its doors to anyone seeking warmth.\nProgram Manager Leona Heisler, shares insights into the non-profit's commitment to providing shelter and support during extreme weather conditions.\nThe shelter's open-door policy ensures that no one is left out in the cold.\n“They just come in, it’s kind of a first come, first serve, but in this weather, we don’t turn anybody away,” says Heisler.\nThe surge in demand during extreme weather poses challenges in maintaining an orderly and comfortable environment within the shelter. Despite facing slight overcrowding, the John Howard Society remains committed to addressing the needs of those in need.\n“We have been having people sleep by the door, in the boot room, and by the entrance, there are benches there,” says Heisler.\nIn instances where a person's behaviour becomes uncontrollable or if the shelter becomes overcapacity, rather than leaving individuals outside in the cold, the shelter contacts local police for an appropriate resolution.\nHeisler explains the shelter's mission and its compassionate approach, stating, \"We are harm reduction, so they don't have to be sober to come in here. They can't use on-site, but as long as you are keeping the peace, you can stay here even if you are intoxicated.”\nHeisler notes that the behaviour of the individuals staying at the shelter hasn't been as challenging as in previous instances, attributing this change to the cold weather conditions.\n“When it's cold like this, usually they are pretty tired.”\nHeisler adds that the community's response to the extreme weather conditions has been appreciated, with an outpouring of support in the form of donations.\nStory continues “We've had a lot of donations in the last couple of days with the cold weather - some cold weather gear, those hand warmer things - and lots of calls with people donating, so it's been really good.”\nDespite the support, the shelter emphasizes a continued need for winter gear and welcomes community involvement.\n“We don’t want to become a secondhand store, but right now we could use winter gear.”\nChantel Downes, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, Lakeland This Week\nTRENDING 1.

En un lugar remoto del desierto de [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona), cerca de una brecha que se abría en el muro fronterizo, decenas de migrantes se acurrucaban junto a unas hogueras de leña. TE PUEDE INTERESAR: [‘Enferman’ ciberataques al sector salud en 2023](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/enferman-ciberataques-al-sector-salud-en-2023-LM10580964) Tras huir de la guerra en Sudán, de bandas violentas en Centroamérica o de los cárteles mexicanos, todos habían cruzado de manera ilegal hacia Estados Unidos, caminaron a pie por terrenos accidentados durante horas y habían llegado a este punto exhaustos, hambrientos y con frío. Querían entregarse a las autoridades para pedir asilo, pero se quedaron varados aquí, a kilómetros de la ciudad más cercana, Sásabe. El martes por la noche, cuando descendieron las temperaturas, llegó un grupo de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza, metió a los hombres en una camioneta para procesarlos y se marchó a toda velocidad, en busca de más personas que necesitaban ser rescatadas. “No estamos equipados para hacer frente a esto”, dijo Scott Carmon, comandante de guardia de la Patrulla Fronteriza, mientras revisaba el campamento. “Es un desastre humanitario”. Esta es la crisis que se está experimentando en la frontera sur, cuando los encuentros con migrantes vuelven a alcanzar niveles históricos y ponen a prueba la capacidad de las fuerzas de seguridad estadounidenses para contener un aumento de cruces ilegales con repercusiones de gran envergadura para el gobierno de Biden. Todos los días llegan a la frontera miles de migrantes procedentes de los confines del planeta, desde África a Asia y Sudamérica, impulsados por la violencia implacable, la desesperación y la pobreza. En mayo, el gobierno de Biden celebró el descenso fugaz de los cruces, incluso después de que se eliminaran las restricciones fronterizas pandémicas y mientras muchos temían que la frontera se desbordara. Pero las cifras han aumentado en los últimos meses, lo que ha generado críticas duras de los dos partidos políticos estadounidenses y temores al interior del gobierno por la posibilidad de que este tema afecte el futuro electoral de los demócratas. La semana pasada, el número de detenciones llegó a más de 10.000, una cifra que puso a prueba los recursos de la Patrulla Fronteriza y desbordó a las pequeñas ciudades de ambos lados de la frontera, por donde los traficantes han canalizado a la gente para establecer nuevas rutas para eludir la captura por parte de las autoridades de EE. UU. “En términos de flujo de migrantes por día, diciembre de 2023 es mayor que cualquier media que hayamos visto nunca”, dijo Adam Isacson, experto en migración de la Oficina en Washington para Asuntos Latinoamericanos. “Todos los funcionarios que lo comentan, a todos los niveles, dicen que están cerca o más allá del límite”. Mientras las autoridades estadounidenses seguían el trayecto de una caravana de más de 2000 migrantes que avanzaba hacia Estados Unidos a través del territorio mexicano, el secretario de Estado de EE. UU., Antony Blinken, y otros altos funcionarios viajaron a México el miércoles para hablar sobre el repunte de la migración con el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Según los expertos, es poco probable que la caravana llegue a Estados Unidos, pero ha generado atención mediática sobre los migrantes que ya han cruzado la frontera de manera masiva. México ha cumplido de manera fiel las restricciones fronterizas de EE.UU., y ha detenido a un número récord de migrantes este año, como muestran las cifras del gobierno. Pero en diciembre, el Instituto Nacional de Migración, un organismo gubernamental, suspendió las deportaciones de migrantes del país por falta de recursos, según un funcionario del instituto que no estaba autorizado a hablar públicamente. Los expertos y las autoridades aún están tratando de entender a qué se debe exactamente el reciente flujo migratorio. Entre las principales teorías están: un mayor número de mexicanos que parecen estar huyendo de las luchas territoriales de los cárteles por todo el país; rumores sobre el fin de una vía legal clave que puede haber provocado la premura por cruzar, y traficantes que han hecho que personas desesperadas de todas las nacionalidades traten de cruzar por zonas cada vez más remotas de la frontera. “Si te trasladas a un lugar remoto, no habrá muchos agentes trabajando y eso aumenta tus posibilidades de ser liberado en EE. UU.”, dijo Isacson. “No hay espacio para poner a la gente. No pueden retenerte”. El martes, Izzeddin, un migrante sudanés de 32 años, se encontraba entre una decena de hombres de su país en aquel campamento de Arizona. Sorbía café azucarado que les dio una organización humanitaria, No Más Muertes, que ha ayudado a los migrantes con mantas, alimentos y llamadas al 911 para tratar lesiones potencialmente mortales. “Venimos aquí porque necesitamos protección”, dijo Izzeddin, quien pidió que se le identificara solo por su nombre de pila, por temor a represalias contra su familia. Una cruenta guerra civil en Sudán ha expulsado a millones de personas de sus hogares, entre ellas, estos hombres, quienes dijeron que perdieron a miembros de su familia y dejaron a sus seres queridos en campos de refugiados para ir a Estados Unidos. Izzeddin dijo que, en Sudán, vio “cómo mataban y violaban a la gente”. Él y sus acompañantes, dijo, esperaban una cosa: “Que la patrulla fronteriza venga a recogernos y nos otorgue protección”. A menudo, los migrantes que llegan a Estados Unidos y solicitan asilo —protección frente a la persecución política o de otro tipo en su país de origen— no logran que sus solicitudes sean examinadas a su llegada. Debido a la capacidad limitada para detener a personas en la frontera, muchos son puestos en libertad con una cita para que un juez evalúe sus casos. El proceso puede durar años. A principios de diciembre, las autoridades fronterizas cerraron un puerto de entrada clave para los cruces legales en Arizona y así centrarse en los cruces ilegales. Carmon, comandante de guardia de la Patrulla Fronteriza, pidió más recursos. “Denos más ayuda, denos recursos de Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias”, dijo. La semana pasada, trabajadores de No Más Muertes evacuaron a migrantes atrapados en un aguacero a unas instalaciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza cercanas, dijo una portavoz del grupo. “Si tuviéramos una ciudad inundada y se tuviera que evacuar a la gente, enviarían camiones de la [Guardia Nacional](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/a-dos-dias-de-inauguracion-aceleran-trabajos-para-terminar-megafarmacia-KC10568424), esos grandes camiones de ganado, y meterían en ellos a nuestros ciudadanos”, dijo Carmon. “Por qué no están aquí ayudándonos a transportar a estas personas a un lugar seguro y cálido, no lo sé”. Para Izzeddin, estar expuesto a los elementos en el desierto le parecía mucho más seguro que permanecer en Sudán. “No importa si hace frío”, dijo. “Aquí hay paz”. c. 2023 The New York Times Company",

    "text": "The African Development Bank plans to produce an additional 120 million tonnes of food by 2025.\nThis announcement was made by the Director General of the AfDB Nigeria Country Department, Abdul Kamara, during a side event at the 2024 West and Central Africa Regional Wheat Summit in Abuja on Thursday.\nHe emphasised the urgent need for enhanced wheat production in West and Central Africa.\nThe summit, themed “Prioritising Policy, Innovative Technologies, and Investments in Wheat Transformation towards Sustainable Food Security and Economy”, highlighted the critical issues facing the region’s agricultural sector.\nKamara noted the rising demand for wheat driven by population growth and urbanisation.\nDespite this demand, he pointed out that domestic production had not kept pace, leading to heavy reliance on imports.\nAccording to Kamara, the recent geopolitical tensions, particularly the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have further exacerbated this situation, increasing vulnerability in the region’s food supply.\nIn response to those challenges, Kamara outlined the AfDB’s Feed Africa initiative, launched in 2016.\nHe said the 10-year strategy aimed to transform agriculture across the continent into a competitive agribusiness sector.\n“The Feed Africa’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation is a major initiative that aims to boost agricultural productivity in all parts of Africa. This will produce an additional 120 million tons of food and lift 130 million people out of poverty,” he stated.\nHe added that the initiative was designed to assist over 40 million farmers by 2025, aiming to double the productivity of crops, livestock, and fisheries.\n“Wheat is a staple food for millions across Africa and plays an essential role in ensuring food security and driving economic growth,” he noted.\nKamara urged a shift towards self-sufficiency, saying, “We must work towards reducing this import dependency and bolster local wheat production to secure our region’s food future.”\nHead of the TAAT Clearinghouse, Dr Solomon Gizaw, highlighted the pressing demand for wheat, noting that wheat consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa has surged by over 6 per cent in the past decade.\nHe emphasised the need for strategic investments in the wheat value chain, pointing out that nations like Nigeria and Cameroon were formulating National Wheat Road Maps to enhance domestic production.\nGizaw added, “Over the past six years, TAAT has successfully distributed heat-tolerant wheat varieties and other crops to over 12 million farmers, leading to an estimated increase in crop production of 25 million tonnes.”\nJigawa State Governor, Umar Namadi, shared the challenges and successes of wheat production in his state.\n“We believe in our land, our people, and our determination,” he said, reflecting on efforts to allocate 40,000 hectares for wheat cultivation.\nHe noted that his administration had implemented programmes to support farmers, resulting in a significant increase in land dedicated to wheat production.\nThe Managing Director of Nile Sun Seed Company Ltd and Chairman of the Sudan Seed Trade Association, Mr Elzubeir Ibrahim, echoed those sentiments.\nHe stated the opportunities presented by heat-tolerant wheat varieties and the growing market demand.\n“This demand creates a pathway for success that we can leverage,” he remarked.\nKamara expressed optimism about the future of wheat production, stating, “Together, we can turn the challenges we face into opportunities and create a prosperous wheat sector that serves the needs of our people.”\nHe encouraged stakeholders to engage in discussions aimed at building resilient agricultural systems capable of supporting Africa’s food security and economic growth.\nThe two-day summit aims to foster partnerships among governments, research institutions, and the private sector to create a sustainable wheat industry in the region.",

    "text": "[Sociedad](/actualidad/sociedad/) Canadá rinde un emotivo homenaje a las víctimas del Pitanxo con el descubrimiento de una placa con el nombre de los 21 fallecidos Las familias reviven la tragedia “con tristeza” dos años después de lucha para conocer la verdad del hundimiento del “Villa de Pitanxo” La localidad canadiense de San Juan de Terranova ha homenajeado a las víctimas del naufragio del pesquero gallego 'Villa de Pitanxo' con la instalación de una placa con los nombres de los 21 fallecidos en la tragedia. Al igual que hicieron el resto de municipios donde residían los marineros que perdieron la vida en el buque, ahora, más de dos años después del hundimiento, el gobierno canadiense también ha querido realizar un homenaje a todos los tripulantes que murieron a 450 kilómetros de su costa en la madrugada del 15 de febrero de 2022. Hasta allí se han desplazado familiares de las víctimas, acompañados por representantes de Pesca de la Xunta de Galicia y del Gobierno de España para descubrir la placa con el nombre de las 21 víctimas y una escultura homenaje. “No pudo haberse elegido un sitio mejor para honrar a los nuestros. Estamos muy agradecidos. El sitio mira al mar en línea recta hacia donde pasó la desgracia y todo ha sido elegido con mucho mino. Si lo hubiésemos hecho las familias, no hubiese quedado tan bien”, ha manifestado la portavoz de las familias, María José de Pazo. El homenaje de este viernes contó con la participación de autoridades de Terranova y del Gobierno de Canadá, entre otras, como la patrulla 'Tarifa' de la Armada Española que también estuvo presente. En su discurso, María José de Pazo ha puesto en valor el significado de la placa instalada en Terranova, que muestra el “sacrificio” de las víctimas. “Esta placa es como las otras nueve que se han colocado en España, la primera fue en Marín, de donde el buque 'Villa de Pitanxo' zarpó por última vez y esta es la última, mirando al mar donde reposa el barco y doce de los 21 fallecidos. Es también un tributo a los pescadores y a los valores que encarnan”. San Juan de Terranova es el lugar a donde llegaron los tres supervivientes y los cuerpos recuperados, además de la ciudad de donde partió el buque Ártabro para acometer la misión de bajada al barco.",

    "text": "By Girish Linganna\nRussia is now working more closely with Iran, North Korea, and China, sharing sensitive technology that could pose a threat to the United States. and its allies even after the Ukraine war ends, say American defense and intelligence officials. The rapid growth and strength of security ties between U.S. adversaries have surprised even American intelligence analysts. According to reports from WSJ, Russia and its Axis allies have put aside past disagreements to challenge what they see as a US-dominated global system.\nIn a sign of their growing military relationship, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced on June 19, in Pyongyang, that they had agreed to help each other if either country was attacked. Their relationship is an alliance between the two authoritarian nations. Russia started increasing its cooperation with North Korea, Iran, and China after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Early losses on the battlefield and Western sanctions forced Russia to seek new sources of weapons. These partnerships have evolved into joint production deals, technology sharing, and providing workers. The agreements are boosting Moscow’s long-term capabilities and could also benefit Tehran, Pyongyang, and Beijing.\nFor decades, the former Soviet Union exported billions of dollars in weapons to the developing world. Now the relationship is partially reversed, as Moscow scours the globe for material to sustain its Ukraine war, now in its 28th month.\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday, alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that Russia’s war in Ukraine is supported by China, North Korea, and Iran. According to the Wall Street Journal, he mentioned that these countries want the US and NATO to fail. If Russia wins in Ukraine, it could make the West more vulnerable and the world more dangerous.\nIran has helped set up a factory in Russia’s Tatarstan region to produce deadly armed drones. US officials believe this factory is now running and can make thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones each year. They also expect it to start producing other types of drones. A US defense official stated that Russia will still have this capability after the war. What started as a simple deal has now turned into a sharing of knowledge.\nIran can see how well its drones, which Russia is using against Ukraine, perform in actual combat. The worry is that Iran might bring all the lessons learned from this back to the Middle East. A senior Biden administration official said that China and Russia are also collaborating to produce nonlethal drones within Russia. The thing is, it’s deniable because it is just sharing technology and the production of commercially available drones.\nOn June 19, when Putin and Kim announced their closer military ties, they didn’t specify whether the new agreement means they will fight for each other in a war or if it simply promises other types of support. The United States and South Korea believe Russia might give North Korea space technology and other advanced systems in exchange for artillery shells and short-range ballistic missiles. They believe North Korea has already supplied these weapons to support Russia’s war on Ukraine. It is believed that North Korea is also sending workers to Russia to help run weapons production lines. In return, Russia has been giving North Korea large amounts of fuel oil. The worry is that Russia’s support could include military help in the future.\nCurrent and former U.S. officials said that the growing security ties between Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China do not yet form a formal military alliance like NATO in the West. Instead, these ties involve separate bilateral agreements between Russia and each of the three other countries. Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA and White House official, recently said that for Russia, North Korea, and even China, such cooperation is more a convenient arrangement based on shared interests and goals right now, rather than a deep alliance. However, the beginnings of a new alliance are forming, showing signs of wider strategic and diplomatic cooperation.\nAccording to Western officials and customs data, China has been leading efforts to strengthen trade ties with countries sanctioned by the US, such as Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, as a way to protect them against Washington’s financial actions. Last month, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers that China and Russia are conducting military exercises for the first time that seem to focus on Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory.\nIn March, Moscow used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to stop the United Nations from continuing to monitor international sanctions on North Korea. This move was to avoid scrutiny of the weapons pipeline between Pyongyang and Moscow. According to a US defense official, the weapons pipeline from Tehran is proving to be the most helpful to Moscow, making Iran Russia’s main weapons supplier. Besides helping build the drone factory in Tatarstan, Iran has sent hundreds of drones and other weapons to Russia. The two countries are in advanced talks for Iran to sell short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.\nIran has, however, denied supplying weapons to Russia. But Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said that in many areas where Iran was once the student, it is now becoming the master. For the first time in history, Iran is more than just a junior partner to Russia.\nCurrent and former U.S. officials said that China has done everything except supply weapons to Russia. Washington has warned that providing weapons would lead to American economic sanctions. US officials said that help from Beijing allowed Russia’s defense production to recover faster than American intelligence agencies expected after Moscow’s early setbacks in Ukraine and Western sanctions aimed at restricting its access to weapons.\nOfficials said that China has sent large amounts of dual-use equipment to Russia, including machine tools, microelectronics for the defense industry, optics for tanks and armoured vehicles, and turbo engines for cruise missiles. China is helping Russia enhance its satellite and other space-based capabilities for use in Ukraine. “They are very careful, but they are coming very close to crossing the line,” a defense official said. “They have been doing everything they can to support the Russians, mindful of the consequences.” (IPA Service",
