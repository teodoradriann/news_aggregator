    "text": "The Astronomy Olympiad Orientation Cum Selection Camp (OCSC) is being held at IISER Mohali. The camp aims to provide training to bright students selected through national-level exams and also test their understanding of concepts and techniques in Astronomy and Astrophysics.\nA total of 54 students were selected for Astronomy OCSC from among the nearly 500 students who took the Indian National Astronomy Olympiad and ranked among the top in their respective groups. Group A consisted of students in Class 12, group B consisted of students in class 10 or 11. The selection is based on rank and subject preferences for students.\nOf these, 37 students from different parts of India are participating in the OCSC, a team of five students will represent the country in at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2025 (IOAA), which is to be held in Mumbai, India in August 2025.\nThe OCSC consists of lectures, tutorials, telescope setup and handling sessions and sky observation sessions. Normally the Astronomy OCSC is organised by the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, a centre of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (HBCSE-TIFR).\nHowever, this year, as HBCSE is hosting the IOAA, the task of selecting and training the Indian team was given to IISER Mohali. A team of astronomers from Central University, Haryana, Mahendargarh, Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, IIT Kanpur, Ashoka University, Sonepat, Central University, Himachal Shahpur, and IISER Mohali worked together to do the groundwork and conduct the OCSC.\nSessions in the training program were anchored by resource persons from these institutes as well as scientists from Raman Research Institute Bangalore, Indian Institute of Astrophysics Bangalore, National Institute for Science Education and Research Bhubaneswar and the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, etc. Some members from the core group will accompany the students as team leaders and scientific observers to the IOAA.\nThe selection of the final team was announced during the valedictory function held at IISER Mohali on June 11, 2025. There was a special lecture by Professor Dipankar Bhattacharya from Ashoka University. He spoke about imaging in different wavebands in Astronomy. This was followed by distribution of certificates and medals from the Indian Association of Physics Teachers, announcement of best performers in the OCSC and also the final team that will represent India in IOAA-2025.\nThe medals were distributed by Professor Kulinder Pal SIngh from IISER Mohali and certificates were given by Professor Dipankar Bhattacharya. The selected team is: Aarush Mishra, Sumant Gupta, Banibrata Majee, Panini, and, Akshat Srivastava. Aarush Misra also got the C L Bhat memorial award for best performance in OCSC. This awarded is given by the Indian Physics Association and was instituted by Arnold Wolfendale. Sumant Gupta got the best performance in observational test award. Akshat Srivastava bagged the two awards for best performance in theory, and, data analysis.\nThe team leaders and scientific observers who will accompany the team were also introduced to students :Professor Jasjeet Singh Bagla and Dr Harvinder Kaur Jassal are the team leaders given their long association with the astronomy olympiad activity. Drs. Kinjalk Lochan, Pankaj Kushwaha, Jaswant Yadav, Central University Haryana; and Mamta Gulati Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala are the scientific observers who will accompany the team for IOAA-2025.\nPublished - June 12, 2025 12:18 pm IST",

    "text": "Advocates share concerns with changes coming to Iowa’s mental health system An overhaul of the state’s mental health and substance abuse system is slated to happen next summer. By Conner Hendricks Published: Dec. 19, 2024 at 6:27 PM CST | Updated: 51 minutes ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nDES MOINES, Iowa (Gray Media Iowa Capitol Bureau) - An overhaul of the state’s mental health and substance abuse system is slated to happen next summer.\nEarlier this year, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill that would merge the state’s 32 separate mental health and substance abuse regions into seven behavioral health districts.\nLeslie Carpenter with Iowa Mental Health Advocacy was excited for the change.\n“The proposal, as I understood it at the time, was that there would be seven behavioral health districts that would provide the administration of both mental illness treatment and substance use treatment in these seven districts with input from people locally within those districts,” she said.\nThat’s not what the state ended up doing. Last week, the state announced it chose a single provider - the Iowa Primary Care Association - to run all seven. And that has Carpenter concerned.\n“If somebody calls from Northwest Iowa, whoever’s answering that phone in Des Moines may not be aware of all of the people and resources that are available in Northwest Iowa,” she said.\nOn a listening session hosted by Iowa HHS Thursday, Sarah Dixon with the Iowa Primary Care Association says managing all seven districts will allow for a singular, centralized administration with staff in each district.\n“These individuals will be tasked with the unique needs of their district, ensuring we’re bringing the right people to the table to complete meaningful district assessment and planning efforts, systems navigation, and community engagement and education,” she said.\nDixon says the ICPA is working to make sure the transition runs smoothly.\n“We are committed to ensuring this transition does not disrupt the care Iowans are receiving today and that our local providers receive the support they need to be successful,” she said.\nCarpenter says she’s worried the state may lose some of its behavioral health staff in the transition. “Even though it hasn’t always run perfectly, the individuals within it are amazing,” she said.\nIowa HHS says it is finalizing the statewide behavioral health system plan. It will allow the public to weigh in on the changes in January before they take effect.\n--\nConner Hendricks covers state government and politics for Gray Media-owned stations in Iowa.

    "text": "Согласно данным, предоставленным лабораторией солнечной астрономии ИКИ и ИСЗФ, в четверг, 14 августа, магнитное поле Земли будет находиться в состоянии повышенной активности.\nКак отмечают астрофизики, рентгеновское излучение, испускаемое Солнцем, как и мощность наблюдаемых вспышек, снизились в несколько раз.\nНесмотря на это, ситуация на Солнце остается нестабильной. На звезде по-прежнему много активных областей, в том числе новых, которые быстро растут.\nОднако в такой ситуации, подчеркивают ученые, крупные вспышки становятся практически невозможными, по крайней мере, в ближайшие два-три дня, вследствие чего геомагнитная обстановка постепенно возвращается в норму.\n«Какие-то заметные изменения ожидаются не раньше начала выходных, – объясняют специалисты. – Если что-то изменится, будем сообщать, но пока о Солнце на какое-то время, может быть, получится позабыть».\nНа утро Kp-индекс составляет 3,67. Скорость солнечного ветра достигнет 497 км/ч. Вероятность сильных магнитных бурь оценивается в 27%, умеренной активности – в 35%, а спокойной обстановки – в 38%.\nСпециалисты в такие дни рекомендуют следить за своим самочувствием, чтобы уменьшить стресс на организм и легче адаптироваться к неблагоприятным условиям.",

    "text": "L'anticiclone africano continua a tenere l'Italia nella sua morsa infuocata, regalando temperature da record che fanno sudare l'intero Paese. Gli ultimi aggiornamenti meteo, inoltre, lanciano un monito: le previsioni sono cambiate e il tanto agognato refrigerio resterà praticamente un miraggio. Venerdì 2 Agosto, ad esempio, si prospetta ancora una giornata rovente, con il Sud Italia in prima linea nella battaglia contro il caldo. La Puglia e soprattutto la Sardegna si apprestano a fronteggiare una vera e propria fornace, con picchi che sfioreranno i 43/44°C, mentre la Sicilia potrebbe anch'essa trasformarsi in un vero e proprio forno a cielo aperto, toccando i 40°C. Il Centro non sarà da meno, con termometri impazziti tra i 35 e i 37°C. Persino il Nord, seppur leggermente più clemente, non riuscirà a sfuggire all'abbraccio soffocante del caldo intenso. Le speranze di una \"rinfrescata\" imminente si sono sgretolate di fronte agli ultimi aggiornamenti meteo. Ciò che ci attende è, in realtà, un timido calo termico che farà fatica a far scendere le colonnine di mercurio sotto i 33-34°C nella maggior parte del Bel Paese. Gli esperti lanciano un appello alla prudenza, soprattutto per i più vulnerabili: anziani, bambini e persone con patologie preesistenti. Il mantra da seguire resta lo stesso: idratarsi spesso, evitare le ore di punta del sole e cercare riparo in oasi di frescura. Insomma, anche se si intravede una piccola luce in fondo al tunnel del caldo estremo, l'Italia non vedrà ancora una vera tregua dalla canicola. L'anticiclone africano, pur mostrando qualche segno di cedimento, continua a dettare legge sul palcoscenico meteorologico del Bel Paese, ricordandoci che l'estate è ancora nel pieno del suo furore.",

    "text": "春风拂面，万物复苏，正是植树添绿的好时节。近日，江西多地主官纷纷带头开展义务植树活动。\n泰和县桥头镇湛口村，蓝天白云与大山、村庄相映成景，构成一幅生态乡村的美丽画卷。大江网视觉江西肖端金摄\n立足实际 探索差异化治理思路\n近期，江西各地掀起的植树热潮，不仅为赣鄱大地增添新绿，更成为观察地方治理智慧的独特窗口。\n举例来说，在“生态文明建设”的统一步调下，吉安市泰和县与新余市渝水区主官通过差异化的政策取向，展现了两地在生态文明建设中的差异化治理思路。\n在泰和县的绿色治理图谱上，林长制构成关键制度支点。从县委书记到村级林长，五级责任体系织就严密的生态保护网，这种“网格化+责任制”的创新实践，使该县森林覆盖率稳定在60%以上。\n3月10日，泰和县委书记孙英剑在泰和公园带头参加2025年全民义务植树活动，众人分工协作、默契配合，植树现场呈现出一派热火朝天的景象，206株新栽树苗在春风中“舒展身姿”。\n“开展全民义务植树是推进国土绿化的重要途径、建设美丽中国的生动实践。”在植树现场，孙英剑表示，全县要严格落实林长制责任，以不断增进民生福祉为根本目标，持续加大森林资源保护工作力度，更好建设人与自然和谐共生的美丽泰和。同时，还要强化宣传引导，加强示范引领，深入开展好全民义务植树，进一步激发广大市民植绿、爱绿、护绿的热情，努力营造全社会共同参与生态文明建设的良好氛围。\n与泰和县形成战略互补的，是渝水区在集体林权制度改革中的破冰之举。2月的植树现场，渝水区委书记彭勇与干部群众的对话始终围绕“深化林权改革”展开。\n在了解全区植树造林、低产低效林改造和森林质量精准提升等工作情况后，彭勇表示，要持续巩固提升生态环境质量，深化集体林权制度改革，着力畅通“两山”转化通道，树立植绿增绿、爱绿护绿的文明风尚，大力倡导绿色低碳的生活方式，建设人与自然和谐共生的美丽渝水，让人民群众的“绿色幸福感”持续增强。\n泰和、渝水两地看似不同的路径选择，实则蕴含着共同的治理智慧——泰和以制度刚性守护生态本底，渝水借改革活力释放生态价值，共同诠释着“生态优先、绿色发展”的时代命题，这种差异化探索，恰是生态文明建设从顶层设计到地方实践的创造性转化。\n身先士卒 确保造林绿化落到实处\n挥锹铲土、培土围堰、浇水灌溉……3月11日，上饶市人大常委会副主任、鄱阳县委书记周金明率队在团林乡开展2025年度新春义务植树活动。\n“造林绿化对于改善生态环境、推动绿色发展意义重大，是实现天蓝、地绿、水清的关键举措。”周金明认为，全县要深入践行“绿水青山就是金山银山”理念，加强组织领导，精心谋划部署，确保造林绿化各项任务落到实处。\n3月8日，湖口县委书记曾宝柱，县委副书记、县长陈洋与干部群众一同参加义务植树活动，经过众人的辛勤劳动，千余株广玉兰、金桂、晚樱、香泡在中国·江豚湾植树点成功“安家落户”。该区域作为长江岸线生态修复的重点工程，通过科学搭配乔木灌木、常绿落叶树种，既构建起江豚栖息地的生态屏障，又打造出四季有景的滨江绿廊。\n“植树造林不是一时之功，而是关系到全县长远发展的战略工程。”在植树过程中，曾宝柱、陈洋表示，要切实抓好植树造林工作，不断改善生态环境，这不仅能提升湖口对外形象，更能提高内在品质，让老百姓实实在在享受到绿色发展带来的生态福利，呼吸上更新鲜的空气，生活在更宜居的家园里，实现经济发展与生态保护的协同共进。\n县区主官带头义务植树的背后，有何深意？生态文明建设不仅仅是一个口号，更需要通过具体的实践来落实，主官带头植树正是推动生态文明建设实践的具体体现之一。当领导干部从“指挥员”变“施工员”，生态文明建设就是更加可见可感的实际行动。这种上下联动的治理模式，为长江经济带生态优先、绿色发展提供了鲜活的县域实践样本。\n拓展路径 将生态优势转化为经济优势\n植树造林是功在当代、利在千秋的事业。近些年来，江西各个县区主官在治理山水的同时，也探索出一条绿色发展的新路径。\n3月10日，全南县委书记曾平，县委副书记、县长边建忠来到植树点，和在场同志一同拿起铁锹、投入植树活动，一棵棵树苗在众人的辛勤劳作下被植入沃土、迎风挺立，孕育着勃勃生机。\n植树间隙，曾平、边建忠不时与有关负责同志亲切交流，勾勒出系统化生态治理的蓝图。他们强调，要持之以恒抓好造林绿化工作，营造爱绿、植绿、护绿的浓厚氛围，科学规划绿化布局，高标准、高质量完成造林绿化任务，切实让广大人民群众享受更多“绿色福祉”。另外，还要依托林业资源优势，大力发展生态农业和林下经济，积极发展森林康养、温泉旅游等新业态，将生态优势转化为经济优势。\n在全南县主官的这番部署中，可以了解当地“林业+”的产业思维——依托83.39%的森林覆盖率，全南正积极打造多种林下经济模式，让每片林海都成为“绿色银行”。\n再来看上犹县。2024年，上犹县已完成低产低效林改造5.84万亩，占计划任务的107.4%。2025年，该县计划完成新造人工林1.3万亩，补植补造阔叶树种0.6万亩。这组数据背后，是“生态优先”的战略定力。\n3月10日，上犹县委书记刘洪梅在全县2025年义务植树活动上称，要牢固树立“绿水青山就是金山银山”的理念，坚持生态优先、绿色发展，筑牢绿色屏障。同时，要利用生态资源，大力发展林下经济，推动生态产品价值实现，着力打通“两山”双向转换通道。\n近年来，上犹县在“森林康养+”上的成功探索，也证明了当生态资本转化为发展动能，绿水青山自会回馈“真金白银”。\n不难看出，县区在追求经济增长的同时，必须注重生态环境的保护和修复，这种协调发展的理念有助于推动地区经济社会的全面进步。当每任主官都成为“绿色接力赛”的选手，当每次植树都播下发展观的“种子”，江西这片红土地终将长成新时代的“生态参天树”。\n付丽玲、中国江西新闻网全媒体记者杜宇蔚/文\n- 1、凡本网注明“中国江西网讯”或“中国江西网”、“大江网”的所有作品，版权均属于中国江西网，未经本网授权不得转载、摘编或利用其它方式使用上述作品。已经本网授权使用作品的，应在授权范围内使用，并注明“来源：中国江西网”。违反上述声明者，本网将追究其相关法律责任。\n- 2、凡本网注明“中国江西网讯[XXX报]”或“中国江西网-XXX报”的所有作品，版权均属于江西日报社，未经本网授权不得转载、摘编或利用其它方式使用上述作品。已经本网授权使用作品的，应在授权范围内使用，并注明“来源：中国江西网·XXX报”。违反上述声明者，本网将追究其相关法律责任。\n- 3、凡本网注明“来源：XXX（非中国江西网）”的作品，均转载自其它媒体，转载目的在于传递更多信息，并不代表本网赞同其观点和对其真实性负责。本网转载其他媒体之稿件，意在为公众提供免费服务，不授权任何机构、媒体、网站或个人从本网转载、截取、复制和使用。如稿件版权单位或个人不想在本网发布，可与本网联系，本网视情况可立即将其撤除。\n- 4、如因作品内容、版权和其它问题需要同本网联系的，请在30日内进行。※联系方式：中国江西网 电话：0791-86849032",
