    "text": "Using speech truthfully is abiding by the truth of God. It can also change us. We all recall moments in our lives when someone was truthful with us and we felt frozen and exhilarated at the same time. Maybe we were confronted about an addiction problem after we’d treated someone poorly. We feel profound joy when someone, through language, affirms us: “You did a good thing. You were kind to that person. You acted like a good Christian.” Pagliarini notes that “love is a kind of knowledge” and that even sinners in Narnia who love Aslan and see him as the truth are welcomed by him. The two men in Texas arrested for having sex who wound up before the Supreme Court and Lawrence vs. Texas never lied about what they were doing. One of them did not claim to be a woman. They were sinners, not liars. Those who abuse and degrade language create lies that can ultimately bring down a world. When enough people believe that men can be women, or that abortion is health care, or that pornography is not just harmless but liberating, the destruction that results can topple cities. Witness liberal places like Portland and San Francisco. Their leaders, like Shift the Ape in Narnia, corrupt language, sometimes even keeping a little truth in there to fool the people. Sure, shoplifting isn’t the worst crime in the world. Decriminalize it then, why not? The next thing you know, the downtown is deserted. Next stop, total collapse. [Orwell knew this too, which is why Newspeak becomes the crux of power in his dystopian “1984.” It is all part of the same denial of reality, and is an engine of moral relativism as well. (I have not yet read much of Lewis’ Narnia series, but this certainly piques my curiosity about it — again.) — Ed]",

In a post on the media platform X, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain said he held a phone call with the Amir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani during which he expressed his sincere gratitude to the Qatar-led mediation role in order to reach a ceasefire and release the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He added that he shared with HH the Amir his concern about the potential Israeli operation in Rafah, emphasizing Spain's commitment to supporting the efforts for a just and sustainable peace in the region through the two-state solution and mutual recognition of the Palestinian statehood. Last month, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani affirmed that the State of Qatar has been committed to the negotiation process since the start of war on Gaza, in pursuit of releasing hostages, helping them return home safely, and ending the war on the Strip.",

    "title": "Hank Naughton: Buck up, Democrats, Joe Biden will prevail in November",
    "text": "It’s hard to ignore the constant polling informing us that Joe Biden will lose his reelection bid. I know many Democrats have bought into the narrative that President Biden is too old and that former President Donald Trump is likely going to win the White House.\nThis is nonsense. Democrats are poised to win in 2024. Just look at what has happened in this country over the last seven years.\nSince Trump became president, Republicans have underperformed in nearly every pivotal election. For example, just a few months ago, in a hotly contested Virginia contest, Democrats took back the state House. The Democratic governor of Kentucky — a supposed red state — was easily reelected. In the 2022 midterms, Democrats picked up seats in the Senate and barely lost the House. Historically, that midterm election should have been a bloodbath for Democrats and Biden.\nWhy are Democrats making gains and Republicans losing elections they should win? There are three answers. First, the overturning of Roe v. Wade has energized many Democratic voters. Second, Trump has branded Republicans as the party of chaos. Third, a lot of Americans are deeply concerned about the lack of respect some Republicans have for our democracy,\nPeople are also reading…\nWhenever Democrats gather, a fatalistic hush permeates the proceedings.\nAlso, the notion that all Republican voters will vote for Trump is dubious. The GOP is deeply divided between the diehard Trump supporters and everyone else. Consider the ridiculous number of votes it took to choose two Republican speakers of the House. The Trump acolytes, including recently elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, run the party. Former congressman Kevin McCarthy was unceremoniously dumped because the MAGA crew never trusted him.\nOn the flip side, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries got the entire Democratic caucus to vote for him in every speaker vote. Even the most progressive members, such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York, supported Jeffries to keep the party unified. Are we supposed to believe that Democratic unity is going to collapse in 2024 under the threat of a second Trump term? Not likely.\nI’m not saying everything is coming up roses for Democrats. The Israel-Gaza war has split the progressives and the White House. And that will cost Biden some votes in November.\nA lot of other issues have shown Democrats to be out of touch on cultural issues. For example, the White House’s unhealthy obsession with forcing everyone to buy electric vehicles. My organization did extensive polling on this issue, and our findings were clear that people think EVs are only for the wealthy and that banning gas-powered vehicles is a terrible idea.\nAs we head into election season, Biden and Democrats can point to many successes, including a strong economy, restoring American manufacturing and standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Biden has had a solid first term.\nWe also must remember that Biden and Trump have squared off before. We all know who won that election, even if the loser refuses to acknowledge it. But this time around, if Trump flops, he won’t be able to use the considerable powers of the presidency to try illegally to remain president. Oh yeah, as we consider the coming election, I haven’t even mentioned that by November, Trump may be a convicted felon.\nWith all of this in mind, I urge Democrats to stay positive. Don’t keep buying the narrative telling us we will lose the election right up until we win.\nNaughton is the president of Centrist Democrats of America. He wrote this for\nInsideSources.com.",

[Storm Gerrit](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/scottish-news/major-search-underway-missing-surfer-31764536) brought havoc to the country on Wednesday with roads closed and ferry and train services cancelled. And there is little let up with two [weather](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/weather) warnings in place on Saturday, December 30. Thousands will be hitting the roads this weekend ahead of the New Year while [Celtic](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc) fans will travel from across Scotland to Parkhead for the Old Firm match. The two yellow alerts both start at 8am on Saturday. A warning for rain and snow is in place until 11.59pm for almost all of the country above the Central Belt as well as western parts. Met Office forecasters say an \"active frontal system will extend northeastwards through Saturday bringing heavy rain to low levels and a period of snow across higher ground to some parts of Scotland\". Up to 25 millimetres of rain could fall in some parts and while snow will be largely confined to higher ground, up to three centimetres could fall in north-western parts even at lower levels.

The snow is expected to turn to rain throughout the day which may lead to flooding on already saturated ground. As well as travel delays, the conditions could cause power cuts and some rural communities could even become cut off.

The Met Office says: \"A band of rain, with snow on high ground for a time, will extend northeast across southern Scotland on Saturday morning, clearing from the west in the afternoon. \"Rainfall totals of 15 to 25 mm are expected across the warning area in a few hours, and 30 to 40 mm possible over hills, along with 2-5 cm of snow above 250-300 metres.\" Bus and train journey times are expected to be longer while spray on the roads will present a hazard to drivers. Interruption to power supplies and other services is \"likely\" according to forecasters. It comes as teams from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution make a final push to get the power supply back on for homes after Storm Gerrit. Around 450 properties remain without power two days after the storm struck. SSEN say these homes are confined to rural parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen. The power supply to around 47,000 homes was cut off by the tempest. For more news, follow us on [here](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/).",

    "title": "Jóvenes voluntarios entrenan duro en la selva de Myanmar para luchar contra la junta - MarketScreener",
    "text": "23 ago (Reuters) - Un denso bosque de bambú en territorio controlado por los rebeldes rodea el campo de entrenamiento en el este de Myanmar donde más de 100 jóvenes, en su mayoría veinteañeros, se someten a rigurosos ejercicios militares.\nDesde antiguos cocineros a experiodistas, raperos y poetas, personas de toda condición se han unido al movimiento de resistencia con un único objetivo: derrocar el régimen militar que tomó el poder en la nación del sudeste asiático en 2021.\nEl Ejército de Liberación del Pueblo Birmano (BPLA), dirigido por el que fuera poeta antibelicista, Maung Saungkha, es una fuerza destacada en el movimiento de resistencia de Myanmar.\nUn instructor, silbato en mano, ordena los movimientos sincronizados de los reclutas. La disciplina se impone con duros golpes ante cualquier error. Bajo un sol abrasador, el sudor empapa sus cuerpos y su piel está marcada con hematomas por el exigente entrenamiento.\nLa rutina diaria de los aprendices comienza a las 4 de la mañana y termina a las 9 de la noche, siendo el domingo su único día libre. Soportan horas de intenso entrenamiento sin que se les permita una sola gota de agua durante las sesiones.\nEl BPLA, que representa a la mayoría étnica birmana de Myanmar, se formó en abril de 2021 para luchar contra la junta, después de que esta derrocara a un Gobierno electo en febrero de ese año. Desde octubre, el grupo ha sido un actor clave en la Operación 1027, una ofensiva conjunta con otras milicias rebeldes que ha debilitado significativamente a los militares.\nMyanmar, que se independizó de Reino Unido en 1948, ha estado dominado durante mucho tiempo por sus militares. Un breve periodo de Gobierno civil terminó con el golpe de 2021, que derrocó al Gobierno de la premio Nobel, Aung San Suu Kyi.\nPara los que se unen a la lucha bajo la bandera del BPLA, su hogar en la selva son tiendas improvisadas, con capacidad para entre 20 y 30 personas cada una.\nSus colchonetas están colocadas en el suelo a pocos centímetros de distancia. Mantener un espacio ordenado es esencial, por lo que los uniformes, los artículos de aseo y los libros de estudio están ordenados en sus camas improvisadas.\nEl entrenamiento básico del BPLA es famoso por su dureza y estricta disciplina. Dura tres meses y lleva a los reclutas a sus límites físicos y mentales. Al llegar al campo de entrenamiento, se confiscan todas las pertenencias personales, incluidos los teléfonos, y sólo se devuelven una vez finalizado el periodo de formación.\nUna de las reclutas, una mujer de 18 años y 1,70 de estatura, muestra signos de desgaste por el agotador régimen. Tiene ojeras, el pelo cortado casi hasta el cuero cabelludo y la piel quemada por el sol debido a las largas horas pasadas al aire libre. A pesar de su agotamiento, transmite una pizca de resistencia y determinación.\nEntre sus pocas posesiones, dice, hay un peluche que trajo consigo al campamento. Cuando le preguntaron por él, sonrió y dijo: \"Una de las instructoras me lo guardó, y me lo devolverá después de la formación\".\nAdemás del entrenamiento militar, los reclutas del BPLA reciben educación política. Tras los ejercicios de la mañana, una breve pausa permite descansar o repasar las lecciones políticas recientes.\nTras la cena, todos se reúnen en el salón de actos construido con bambú. La bandera de BPLA cuelga sobre la pizarra. Las luces fluorescentes, alimentadas por un generador, iluminan la sala. Aquí tienen lugar las clases nocturnas de política.\nCada tarde, Maung Saungkha profundiza en los principios fundacionales del BPLA, la estructura del gobierno, el federalismo e incluso la igualdad de género. Sus palabras resuenan en la improvisada sala.\n\"Sé que están agotados\", les dice, \"pero el deber de un soldado trasciende la fatiga\".\n(Editado en español por Héctor Espinoza)\nComparte © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Pierce Brosnan faces charges after allegedly walking in Yellowstone's thermal areas Actor Pierce Brosnan could be facing possible jail time after allegedly walking in Yellowstone National Park's hydrothermal areas in violation of federal law, according to court documents. Brosnan is facing citations of \"foot travel in all thermal areas and w/in Yellowstone Canyon confined to trails\" and \"violating closures and use limits,\" the court record shows. Criminal charges were filed against the Irish actor in Wyoming on Tuesday. [Federal law states](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-36/chapter-I/part-7/section-7.13): \"Foot travel in all thermal areas and within the Yellowstone Canyon between the Upper Falls and Inspiration Point must be confined to boardwalks or trails that are maintained for such travel and are marked by official signs.\" A representative for the 70-year-old Brosnan, who is best known [for his stint as James Bond](https://www.npr.org/2012/10/05/162175114/picking-the-best-bond-connery-and-craig-rise-to-the-top) in films in the 1990s, didn't respond to NPR's request for comment. What's the big deal? Within Yellowstone National Park's roughly 2.2 million acres there [are more than 10,000](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/parkfacts.htm)different hydrothermal features, like geysers and hot springs. The park provides many [guidelines and warnings](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm) online and throughout the park for visitors to be aware of the dangers posed by hot springs and the like. The park says, \"Hot springs have injured or killed more people in Yellowstone than any other natural feature.\" More than 20 people have died after entering or accidentally falling into Yellowstone's hot springs, [according to the park](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/thermal-basin-exploring.htm) because certain thermal pools can reach deadly temperatures of over 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Still, a number of visitors to the park, like allegedly Brosnan, [violate this law when they visit Yellowstone](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/22/video-shows-pair-leave-yellowstone-boardwalk-to-dip-fingers-in-175-degree-thermals/) — some incidents leading to serious injury or even death. In August, a 49-year-old Michigan man was arraigned in federal court for traveling off-trail in Yellowstone's thermal area. Jason Wicks suffered thermal burns and was banned from Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks until his criminal charges are resolved, [according to the park.](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/23034.htm) Other violators in recent years have [faced a week](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/210826.htm)to [a 10-day jail sentence](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/20001.htm), hundreds of dollars in fines and a lengthy ban from Yellowstone. Brosnan's court appearance is set for Jan. 23. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",
