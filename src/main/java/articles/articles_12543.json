    "title": "Husky football players take their skills from the field to the classroom and beyond | UW News",
    "text": "[UW News](https://www.washington.edu/news/) January 5, 2024 Husky football players take their skills from the field to the classroom and beyond What skills does it take to win a college football game? Fans in the stands or commentators would probably say things like a good game plan, athletic prowess, teamwork and a little luck. But they may not name other skills essential for victory, like empathy, analyzing complex behaviors and synthesizing data from multiple sources. “Student players — in their training, in their practices and on the field — are developing complex and valuable skillsets,” said [Holly Barker](https://anthropology.washington.edu/people/holly-m-barker), a University of Washington teaching professor of anthropology and curator of Oceanic and Asian culture at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. “They’re developing and analyzing plays, observing human behavior, anticipating their opponents, and adapting a complex strategy based on real-time information that they’re synthesizing from their surroundings. That hasn’t been widely acknowledged, and does a disservice to players, especially in the academic opportunities they pursue and their future careers.” Barker and three current members of the UW football team — [Ulumoo Ale](https://gohuskies.com/sports/football/roster/ulumoo-ale/14905), [Makell Esteen](https://gohuskies.com/sports/football/roster/makell-esteen/15958) and [Faatui Tuitele](https://gohuskies.com/sports/football/roster/faatui-tuitele/16026) — are studying how the skills they develop to maximize their chances of victory on the field have applications outside the stadium. Their work, which is ongoing, is showing that the research methods and analytical abilities of student-athletes are applicable in academic and research settings, as well as jobs in a variety of fields. “We’re focused on bridging the gap between school and football, student-athletes and students, to just show there’s hard work in both the classroom and on the field,” said Esteen, a sophomore safety, who noted studying opponents, their tendencies, and analyzing angles and distances on the field as some examples of football-related skills that can translate to academic work. “Many students wouldn’t know that there are probably more than 100 similarities between school and football.” This project began in the classroom. Football players taking an introductory-level course called “Anthropology and Sports” started to recognize that the types of skills they developed as student-athletes had parallels to skills that their fellow undergraduates learned and practiced in internships, independent research projects and other research and learning settings that help students prepare for graduate school and the job market. “In our class with athletes and non-athletes, we would have a member of the football team describe to us some of the studying and analyses they do of past games, for example, and as they walked us through the step-by-step process, fellow students would point out that they’re essentially performing advanced trigonometry, human behavioral analysis, and so on,” said Barker. Players at the college level often spend thousands of hours immersed in their sport. It became clear during the course that those research methods aren’t widely acknowledged in academic settings, with real-world consequences for players. “These are skills that other students would put on their resumes for applications for internships, graduate school and jobs,” said Barker. “Once we realized that they have these research skills they are not accounting for in their applications to graduate school or for professional jobs, then we focused on the need to articulate the research skills that they acquire.” Since then, Barker, Ale, Esteen and Tuitele have explored the connections between research skills acquired in football and so-called “traditional” academic skills. The students used interviews, focus groups and other analysis methods to collect data that would help them better articulate the research knowledge and skills that emerge from deep engagement with football — as well as how those skills are perceived and interpreted by players and non-players. So far, they’ve identified overlaps between research skills acquired in football or the classroom for fields ranging from psychology and data science to applied mathematics and game theory. “One part of the research was actually looking at the Boeing Technical Apprenticeship Program,” said Tuitele, a junior defensive lineman. “There are traits that they require, like teamwork, determination, responsibility, accountability. There’s a list of traits that they’re looking for in their program. And I was, like, ‘Oh, this is perfect.’ We were listing each one of them and I was thinking we already do all of these things in football that we can apply to other careers.” Part of the group’s goal is to help researchers and educators in other academic fields recognize the unique skillsets and knowledge of student-athletes in their lecture halls and research laboratories. “That’s kind of the point, just to educate and convey to people who may not see football and school as equal,” said Tuitele. “A lot of people would separate that and separate the ‘student’ and ‘athlete.’ And we’re really just trying to bridge that hyphen in between ‘student-athlete.’ Changing that hyphen to an equal sign is what we did in our research project — ‘student-athlete’ is going to be ‘student-equals-athlete,’ because the knowledge that we use in academics is the same knowledge that we use in football, and vice versa.” The group also wants to help college football players become advocates for their skillsets as they pursue academic opportunities in college, as well as apply for jobs and graduate-level programs. College players pursue a variety of careers, but often without leveraging the knowledge base and intellectual abilities they’ve fostered through practice, study and performance on the field. “I know, personally, a lot of football players who don’t feel like they can apply themselves into the real world after football,” said Tuitele. “They feel like they lose their identity after football, you know? Sometimes they feel like football is all that they know and football is who they are. And we just tried to really show that, for football players who feel that way, you can apply yourself to real world. Things that you learned in football, you can also apply to any career, any job that you want in the future.” [Burke Museum of Natural History & Culture](https://www.washington.edu/news/tag/burke-museum-of-natural-history-culture/)• [College of Arts & Sciences](https://www.washington.edu/news/tag/college-of-arts-sciences/)• [Department of Anthropology](https://www.washington.edu/news/tag/department-of-anthropology/)• [Holly Barker](https://www.washington.edu/news/tag/holly-barker/)• [UW Athletics](https://www.washington.edu/news/tag/uw-athletics/)• [UW football](https://www.washington.edu/news/tag/uw-football/)",

    "title": "Atom bomb survivor hopes Japan debut of 'Oppenheimer' will stoke nuclear debate",
    "text": "Teruko Yahata was eight when she saw a blueish-white light envelop the sky over her home city of Hiroshima one summer morning, moments before the first atomic bomb explosion knocked her unconscious and levelled swathes of the Japanese city. Now 86, she is eager to be among the first to see the film \"Oppenheimer\" at its delayed opening in Japan on March 29, hoping the biopic of the scientist who led the development of the bomb will reinvigorate debate over nuclear weapons. \"I don't hold a grudge against Mr Oppenheimer himself or anything like that. It's a much bigger issue,\" said Yahata, who often speaks on behalf of survivors of the nuclear blasts in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War Two. \"I think it's important for the Oppenheimer film to be screened in Japan, so we can learn from it and not lose that awareness that we need to preserve a future for our loved ones.\" The film about atomic bomb pioneer J. Robert Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is expected to win numerous Oscars at next week's Academy Awards, having already grossed nearly $1 billion since its opening in July 2023. But Japan was initially left out of plans for the worldwide screening. The opening in late summer came just weeks before solemn memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki held annually to mark the bombings that claimed more than 200,000 lives. Some critics said the film glossed over the human cost in Japan. And many Japanese were offended by a grassroots marketing campaign yoking the film to \"Barbie,\" another blockbuster that opened around the same time, with fan-produced pictures of the films' stars alongside images of nuclear blasts. A #NoBarbenheimer hashtag trended online in Japan, prompting an apology from \"Barbie\" distributor Warner Bros. Bitters End, a Japanese distributor of independent films, eventually picked up \"Oppenheimer\" and set the opening date of March 29. Neither Bitters End nor global distributor Universal Pictures responded to requests for comment. The only nation to have suffered atomic bombings, Japan has led global efforts to abolish the weapons. The issue took on renewed resonance in 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and nuclear sabre-rattling by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yahata, one of a dwindling number of \"hibakusha\", as survivors of the nuclear explosion are known, waited until late in life to give witness to her experience on the morning of Aug. 6, 1945, and the horrors that followed. She took English lessons to better tell her story to foreign visitors at the bomb museum and monuments in Hiroshima. She recounts glimpsing the blast as she stepped into her family's garden, a moment before its force knocked her back six metres. \"The entire sky flashed and was illuminated in bluish white, as if the heavens had become a huge fluorescent light,\" Yahata has said in her testimony. Thinking about the process of making the bomb and the decision to drop it on her home sends shivers down her spine, Yahata said, but she feels a degree of empathy for Oppenheimer and his team. \"It must have weighed heavily on their consciences,\" she said. \"Oppenheimer probably understood better than anyone what a terrible thing would result from the creation of atomic weapons.\" (Reporting by Tom Bateman in Hiroshima; Writing and additional reporting by Rocky Swift in Tokyo; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "title": "Ogun as topmost economy",
    "text": "FOR the umpteenth time, Ogun State once again emerged as one of the three leading economically viable states in Nigeria. For three consecutive sessions under the administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun, the state has routinely maintained its competitive edge over the rest parts of the country. This time around, as a testament to its growing economic potential, the latest report conducted by Economic Confidential, measuring the Internally Revenue Generating (IGR) capacity of each state as a percentage of Federal allocation, put Ogun State on the front roll. While states like Bayelsa, Katsina, Jigawa, Niger, Adamawa, Yobe, and Taraba remained on the fringes and largely insolvent, Lagos, Ogun, and Rives states maintained their leading position among those that could conveniently survive without any federal allocation. Putting the state on the pedestal of sustainable growth within a term of four years is no mean feat. As a comparative analysis of the annual State Viability Index indicates, those categorised as insolvent generally have an IGR of less than 10 percent of their total receipts of federal allocation. Based on this standard, only six states have the economic potential to stay afloat under zero allocation from the Federal Government. And Ogun State stands tall among its peer group, closely trailing Lagos.\nAccording to the report, Ogun State is next to Lagos as Nigeria’s top investment destination. By comparative analysis, the Abiodun-led administration outshone Rivers State on the list of economically viable states for the year 2022 alongside Kaduna, Kwara, Oyo, and Edo states. The breakdown of the figures compiled from the release by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) showed that Lagos received the sum of N370, 921, 413, 425.62 from the Federation Account and generated N651,145, 633.085 as internally generated revenue, while Ogun received N113,404, 027,439.22 from the Federation Account and generated N120,548, 157,140.78 internally. On the other hand, Rivers State received N363.4bn from the Federation Account and generated N172bn; Kaduna received N155bn and generated N58bn; Kwara received N99bn and generated N35.7bn; Oyo received N181bn and generated N62bn, while Edo received N147bn in federal allocation and generated N47.4bn.\nThis revelation was made during the presentation of the 2022 Annual States Viability Index Report in Abuja recently. In summary, the figures showed that the total Internally Generated Revenue of N1.5trn from the seven most viable states in 2022 was almost twice the total IGR of 29 states put together merely generating about N650bn. On the flipside, six states, including Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, and Katsina states, failed to generate up to 10 percent of the total allocations received from the Federal Government for 2022 and were therefore declared insolvent. Interestingly, oil-rich Bayelsa state is at the bottom of the list with N273bn federal allocation and N15.9bn IGR, representing 5.81% of the allocations. On the other hand, Kebbi State received N119bn FAAC allocation and generated N9bn IGR, representing 7.67 percent, while Katsina which got N165bn FAAC allocation, recorded N13bn IGR, representing 7.90 percent. Similarly, Akwa Ibom which received N360bn, generated N34.8bn, representing 9.66 percent, while its Taraba state counterpart earned N103 billion FAAC and generated N10.2 billion, translating to 9.91 percent. Yobe received N105bn and generated N10.4bn, accounting for 9.91 percent.\nThere is a wide range of implications for these poorly performing states. One, they will only depend on federal allocation to survive because of their comparatively low capacity for internally generated revenue (IGR). Secondly, they will have comparatively less revenue left to implement the capital expenditure components of their budgets, thus facing a greater risk of resorting to more borrowing or under-implementing their capital budgets. Worse than that, they offer no attraction for investment that could lead to economic growth. Ogun State is a nautical mile away from this scenario. Ranked higher on the performance index, it has comparatively limited dependence on federally distributed revenue for its operations and thus has greater viability if it were to theoretically exist as an independent entity.\nThis achievement is a testament to the positive result of the I-S-E-Y-A mantra of the administration. As an initiative invented to stimulate collective action for greater efficiency and productivity, the administration has never looked back on its drive for sustainable economic growth and prosperity for all since Abiodun assumed the mantle of leadership in 2019. Whatever the state has been able to achieve in terms of infrastructure development, healthcare delivery, education and human capital development, transportation, housing, youth empowerment, and agriculture, among others, is a result of collective ownership of the process, which is encapsulated in the acronym I-S-E-Y-A. It, therefore, goes without saying that the initiative has contributed significantly to poverty reduction and widespread prosperity throughout Ogun State.\nRight from the inception of his administration, Governor Abiodun has routinely maintained his mission statement, focusing on “qualitative governance and to create the enabling environment for a public-private sector partnership, which is fundamental to the creation of an enduring economic development and individual prosperity of the people”. So, by sustaining the trajectory of growth, certainly, the best is yet to come for the state. It can only get better with continued commitment, focused leadership, and support of the citizenry.\nOver the years, relevant stakeholders have always expressed concern over states’ heavy dependence on federal revenue for the implementation of yearly budgets. This is borne out of the need for enhanced public revenue generation to implement capital expenditure components of their budgets after fulfilling obligations to workers and other operating expenses. However, due to a lack of creative ideas, fiscal transparency, and accountability in public finance, most states have remained indifferent to the call.\nContrarily, Governor Abiodun has included an aggressive revenue drive as part of the cardinal agenda of his administration since its inception. And that is what has accounted for the less dependence of the state on revenue allocation from the Federal Government.\nIt is also the reason for the success the administration has recorded in the area of infrastructure development which makes the state a leading investment destination not only in Nigeria but West African sub-region.\nWith an assurance of an enabling environment, Governor Abiodun has continued to extend his calls on foreign businesses to make the state, especially the Special Economic Processing Zone, the destination of choice while considering investing in Nigeria.\nWhile speaking as a guest on CNBC Africa recently on the sidelines of the Intra-African Trade Fair, put together by Afreximbank, in Cairo, Egypt, he said Ogun State had put everything in place to host any business venture.\nHe said Ogun State had the required infrastructure, including accessibility, access to power, and a youthful and educated population to make it investor-friendly.\nHis words: “We like to refer to ourselves as the Gateway State. We are the gateway to Nigeria’s prosperity. We are the industrial capital of Nigeria. By all accounts, we have well over 5,000 industries. We are the number one in non-oil revenue in Nigeria because we have large mineral deposits, particularly limestone.\n“That explains why we have Lafarge, Dangote, and many other cement factories. The biggest cement factory in Nigeria is in Ogun State.\n“Now, why are we here (Cairo)? We are here to attract more investors to our state, particularly as we pride ourselves on having the required infrastructure, be it road, rail, or air. We have a new airport, unarguably one of the best airports in Nigeria.\n“Our Airport is situated in our Special Economic Processing Zone. The zone is being supported by Afreximbank and being operated and constructed by a private sector player called Arise LLP.\n“Today, we want people to know about the zone, to come and establish processing concerns and factories in that zone, referencing the 5,000 other industrial activities that exist in Ogun State.”\nThe governor listed some of the companies in the state including Lafarge, Nestle, Cadbury, May&Baker, Unilever, and Olam flours, among others. He noted that companies coming to invest in the state would take advantage of its vast agro-produce like rubber, cassava, which Ogun is the number one producer in the world, palm oil, cashew, cocoa, cotton, eggs, and poultry.\n“We are trying to attract investors to this processing zone, more so because we have gas, which allows them to access power. So, you are sure that your major cost of production, which could be power in most instances, is already mitigated.\n“And I believe that we’ve managed to convince a lot of our listeners that Ogun State, the industrial capital of Nigeria, the education capital of Nigeria with reserve of youthful population is ready to receive you and as a government, we’ve provided a lot of reforms and policy initiatives to further increase our rating on the ease of doing business index,” he added.\nThe Governor also spoke on the significance of the African Quality Assurance Centre (AQAC), which has been established at the Special Economic Processing Zone, a development which he said, would make Nigeria get value for her agro-produce.\nBut with AQAC in Ogun State, and within the agro-processing zone, Prince Abiodun said agro-produce from Nigeria can now be certified fit-for-purpose in line with world best practices. “And now, what they\ndo in AQAC is, they don’t wait until you have grown or you have harvested. They intervene from the point of your inputs, from the point of how you have planted, from what type of fertilisers you have used, from what type of fertilisers you were meant to use to ensure that by the time they are stamping your agro-produce, it is certified fit-for-purpose.\n“Hitherto, when goods will have to go to Ghana or any other country to be exported, it means that agro-produce would probably have been undervalued. So, from now on, Nigeria can now export its agro-produce at the right value because it’s stamped fit-for-purpose from Nigeria,” he enthused.\nBy the time all of these propositions come to fruition, Ogun State will be the envy of all. And they will because the foundation for the necessary infrastructure that would serve as a pull factor has already been put in place.\nThis is part of the reason Prince Abiodun emerged as Vanguard’s Governor of the Year 2021 Award for creating enduring economic development and individual prosperity in Ogun State. As attested to by the organisers of the event, he emerged winner of the award through a rigorous selection process. Since then, he’s been doing his best not to let the guard down.\n- Ogbonnikan writes in from Abeokuta, Ogun State.\nYOU SHOULD NOT MISS THESE HEADLINES FROM\n NIGERIAN TRIBUNE Primate Ayodele releases 91-page prophecy for 2024\nThe leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has released his prophecies for 2024 as it is…\nNIMC issues new guidelines for date of birth modification\nThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued new guidelines for the modification of…\nSen Natasha spreads Christmas cheer with generous palliatives in Kogi Central\nIn commemoration of Christmas and New Year celebrations, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan (Kogi Central), has put smiles on…\nFive Nigerian musicians who had the biggest hit songs in 2023\nNigeria’s music industry had a remarkable year, with talented singers and hit songs making…\nHistory will judge me, I gave Nigeria my best as ‘president,’ IBB declares\nFormer military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) has said history will judge him as leader of the country for…\nAnthony Joshua beats Otto Wallin in five rounds\nAnthony Joshua delivered one of his best displays in recent memory with an impressive stoppage of Otto Wallin in…",

    "text": "Like others in the travel industry, Expedia Group saw a “challenging” global economy and “softening” travel demand in July.\nIn its second-quarter earnings announcement Thursday, the company said it would lower its outlook.\n“Our second quarter results came in at the high end of our expectations, with gross bookings and revenue growing 6%,” said CEO Ariane Gorin in her first earnings announcement heading the company. “We’re pleased with our momentum and the sequential improvement in our consumer brands. However, in July, we have seen a more challenging macro environment and a softening in travel demand. We are therefore adjusting our expectations for the rest of the year.”\nBut one standout element of the announcement was that room nights at flagship brand Expedia.com jumped 20%. That compared to 9% growth in the second quarter of 2023.\nOverall at Expedia Group, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo and other brands, booked room nights grew 10% to 98.9 million. That was faster than Airbnb’s 9% (nights and experiences booked) and Booking Holdings’ at 7%.\nThe company’s 10% room night growth was the fastest in a year-a-half.\n“Total room nights grew at the fastest rate since the first quarter of 2023,” Expedia Group said in its second quarter earnings announcement.\nNet income was flat at $386 million compared to the second quarter of 2023.",

    "text": "More than 800 million adults have diabetes worldwide, almost twice as many as previously thought, research has suggested.\nThe study, published in the journal The Lancet02317-1/fulltext) to coincide with World Diabetes Day earlier this week (14 November), also concluded that more than half of those aged over 30 who have the condition are not receiving treatment.\nThe global prevalence of diabetes has doubled since 1990 to 14% from around 7%, the study argued, with much of this increase being driven by rising numbers of diagnoses in low- and middle-income countries.\nIn all, in 2022, there were around 828 million people aged 18 years and older with type 1 and type 2 diabetes worldwide, the study found. Among adults aged 30 years and older, 445 million, or 59% of them, were not receiving treatment, the authors said.\nDiabetes\nEating just two slices of ham daily can raise risk of diabetes\nNHS diabetes ‘soups and shakes’ programme helps a third into remission\nType 2 diabetes up 40% among under-40s since 2016, warns charity\n“Our results show an expanding inequity of diabetes in the world: the largest increases in prevalence have occurred in low-income and middle-income countries, whereas the improvements in treatment were largest in high-income and industrialised nations in Europe, north America, Australasia, and the Pacific, and some well performing middle-income nations and emerging economies, especially those in Latin America,” the study argued.\n“These trends have widened the global gap in diabetes prevalence and treatment, with an increasing share of people with diabetes, especially with untreated diabetes, living in low-income and middle-income countries,” it said.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has previously estimated that about 422 million people have the condition, and WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the new figures suggested there had been “an alarming rise in diabetes over the past three decades”.\nThis reflected the increase in obesity, compounded by the impacts of the marketing of unhealthy food, a lack of physical activity and economic hardship, he added.\n“To bring the global diabetes epidemic under control, countries must urgently take action. This starts with enacting policies that support healthy diets and physical activity, and, most importantly, health systems that provide prevention, early detection and treatment,” Dr Ghebreyesus said.\nSign up to our weekly round-up of HR news and guidance\nReceive the Personnel Today Direct e-newsletter every Wednesday",
