    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — Due to the colder weather Columbus is experiencing, the Community Shelter Board has opened nine shelters to provide a safe environment to those who need it.\nView a list of daytime warming stations here .\nIn addition, the Community Shelther Board gave these facts and resources to Spectrum News 1:\nNine shelters are geographically disbursed across Columbus to provide 24/7/365 response to individuals and families experiencing homelessness, providing a safe and dignified environment to meet their immediate needs and connect them with resources to regain housing stability. Working in system congruency – dedicated, around-the-clock shelter staff act as first responders, providing intake for community members, navigating housing options, and keeping men, women, and families safe every single day and night of the year. The 24-hour homeless hotline answers 10,000-plus calls a year to connect people to shelter beds or help them find better options than shelter. On any given night this winter, there are more than 1,200 people sleeping in Columbus shelters. 7,800 people slept in homeless shelters last year — 1,900 of them were children. Homeless shelters and warming stations play a crucial role in providing a lifeline to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. They offer a refuge from the extreme weather conditions, protecting vulnerable individuals from life-threatening exposure to cold temperatures, frostbite and hypothermia. If you need access to an overnight shelter in Columbus, please call the centralized homeless hotline at 614-274-7000. This was a preliminarily conversation can be had and the needs of the person can be met. Please do not hesitate to call if needed. No one will be turned down.

The ambitious game has been heavily criticised due to server problems and deceived expectations .\nThe ambitious game, which was supposed to be a new milestone in the history of flight simulators, turned out to be filled with a huge number of problems and three days after the release many gamers are unable to launch it even after increasing the capacity of servers.\nHere's What We Know Game director of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Jorg Neumann published a statement in which he admitted that the release of the game did not go as planned and Asobo Studio apologises to those who were eagerly waiting for the release of the flight simulator.\nThe development team promises to make a huge effort, working day and night to fix all the bugs in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 so that everyone can finally enjoy flying.\nFor this purpose Asobo Studio will release as many patches as needed.\nWe have increased our server capacity and are seeing more players accessing the sim, however, we are still seeing access issues continue.\nThis is not the launch experience we want for our players and want to apologise to the community. We will continue to work around the clock....\n- Microsoft Flight Simulator✈️ (@MSFSofficial) November 21, 2024\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 has already entered Steam's \"Hall of Shame\" and has a rating worse than the absolutely failed Redfall and Payday 3.\nSource : Steam\nPC Microsoft Simulators Xbox Game Pass Xbox Game Studios",
