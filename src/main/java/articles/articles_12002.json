    "title": "Nation vows to boost ties with Solomon Islands - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "Premier Li Qiang pledged on Thursday to enhance ties between China and the Solomon Islands, and expressed Beijing's commitment to working with Pacific island countries to build an even closer community with a shared future. Li made the remarks during his talks in Beijing with Jeremiah Manele, prime minister of the Solomon Islands. Manele is making a weeklong official visit to China that started on Tuesday. China will continue to uphold the principles of mutual respect, equality, mutually beneficial cooperation and common development to promote the steady development of comprehensive strategic partnerships with Pacific island countries, including the Solomon Islands, Li said. During the meeting, Li highlighted the robust growth of bilateral relations over the past five years since the two countries established diplomatic ties, saying that political mutual trust between China and the Solomon Islands has continuously deepened and their exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been fruitful. China supports the Solomon Islands in independently choosing a development path that suits its national conditions, and is willing to work together to firmly support each other's core interests, he said. China is ready to share more development experiences with the Solomon Islands and strengthen cooperation in infrastructure, rural development, communication and low-carbon transformation, Li said. He also noted that the nation is also willing to import more high-quality agricultural products from the Solomon Islands and encourage eligible Chinese enterprises to invest in the country. Both sides should enhance exchanges and cooperation in education, healthcare, culture, sports and youth development, deepen subnational partnership, and further facilitate people-to-people exchanges, in order to solidify the foundation of public support for bilateral cooperation, he added. Manele expressed his appreciation for the fruitful cooperation between the Solomon Islands and China over the past five years, and thanked China for its strong support for the economic and social development of his country. The Solomon Islands steadfastly adheres to the one-China principle, supports President Xi Jinping's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and highly appreciates China's contributions to promoting world peace and development, he said. It is willing to deepen cooperation with China in the fields of economy and trade, infrastructure construction, healthcare, culture and poverty alleviation, and jointly address global challenges such as climate change, he added. Following their talks, the two leaders witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation agreements on jointly building of the Belt and Road, economy and trade, education, the digital economy, green development, and inspection and quarantine. Egyptian leader greeted In another development, Premier Li congratulated Mustafa Madbouly on his reappointment as Egyptian prime minister on Thursday. In a congratulatory message sent to Madbouly, Li highlighted the deep-rooted friendship between China and Egypt, emphasizing the robust development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations in recent years, which he said has brought tangible benefits to the people of both countries. The Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of Sino-Egyptian relations, and is willing to work together with the new Egyptian government to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries to deepen political mutual trust and enhance friendly cooperation in various fields to drive bilateral relations to new heights, Li said. caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn",

    "title": "Vrioni happy to join CF Montreal, doesn't feel pressure as only designated player",
    "text": "Giacomo Vrioni says his play will do the talking.\nThe recently acquired striker knows CF Montreal will lean on him to perform as the Major League Soccer team’s only designated player, and he’s comfortable with those expectations.\n\"I don't feel the pressure,” Vrioni said Thursday during a video conference from Montreal’s training camp in Florida. “If you want to give, if you want to push yourself, you have to live with (pressure). But I know in what team I am, I know all the confidence that team president Gabriel Gervais gives to me, the coach gives to me and all my teammates.\n“Now the pitch is gonna talk.”\nVrioni, however, hasn’t quite lived up to the hype since he entered Major League Soccer.\nThe 26-year-old Albanian international joined the New England Revolution from prestigious Italian club Juventus in July 2022 for a transfer fee of US$3.8 million. He also led the Austrian Bundesliga in scoring while on loan at WSG Tirol.\nIn MLS, Vrioni has produced only 16 goals and three assists in 67 games, including nine goals in 31 appearances last season, when his salary was $1,947,500.\nMontreal spent the small sum of $50,000 in general allocation money to acquire him from New England on Jan. 7. The Revolution also retained part of his salary to complete the deal.\nBut Vrioni said he isn’t arriving in Montreal with a chip on his shoulder. He’s excited for the new chapter ahead.\n“They bought me because I probably fit the way that the coach (Laurent Courtois) wants to play,” he said. “I'm happy about that. The club believes in me, this is the first feeling that I felt directly after the trade.\"\n“I don't have nothing to prove,” he later added. “Of course, I have motivation because I'm still 26 so I have a lot (left) to say on the field. I can say that I will give my maximum every single time on the field, and every time to the training, because I am a guy that works hard every single day, from the morning to the night.”\nThe six-foot-two Vrioni describes himself as a player who gets in behind the defence, creates space for his teammates by holding up the ball and is ready to do “all the little things” Courtois asks of him.\nHe and fellow new attacker Prince Owusu, acquired from Toronto FC, will carry the goal-scoring burden this season after Montreal declined the contract option of veteran Josef Martinez and loaned Matias Coccaro to Mexico's Atlas FC.\nWhile Coccaro struggled to find his footing, Martinez spearheaded Montreal’s late-season run into the playoffs with eight goals in six games to end the year.\n“What Josef did was extraordinary, especially at the end of the season,” Courtois said. “But sometimes because of the timing there’s turnover, it happens to all teams across the world.”\nMartinez’s level of production will be tough to match, but team captain Samuel Piette believes Vrioni and Owusu can provide more than just scoring goals.\n“I don’t think Josef was perfect in terms of overall play,” Piette said last week. “Yes, for a striker the important thing is to score goals, but I know that team’s project is about more than that.\n“From what I’ve seen so far, the new acquisitions aren’t players who just stand in the box and wait for the ball to arrive at their feet or head. These are players who are really involved in building up the play, moving the other team, et cetera.”\nMontreal plays its first of four exhibitions Friday afternoon against FC Cincinnati in Clearwater, Fla. The club returns to Montreal for training sessions at Complexe sportif Marie-Victorin from Jan. 26 to Feb. 4 before wrapping up pre-season in Orlando from Feb. 5 to 21.\nCourtois’s side begins the 2025 MLS campaign against Atlanta on Feb. 22 and won’t host its home opener until April 12 against Charlotte FC at Stade Saputo.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 23, 2025.\nDaniel Rainbird, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "The little girl critically injured in the Dublin crèche attack is out of danger – and has even smiled, her mother has revealed. The five year old, who suffered serious injuries in the November 23 attack on the crèche at Gaelscoil Cholaiste Mhuire on the city’s Parnell Square East, is still receiving hospital treatment – but her mum says her condition has now improved. The mother last night took to a special GoFundme page - *’Barróg do Chailín Beag’ (A Hug for a Little Girl) - * to help the family with costs following the incident to thank everyone for their help and give the good news about the girl’s condition. She told contributors that her daughter left the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of CHI’s Temple Street Hospital close to the scene of the attack a fortnight ago. She said: “Hi everyone, here is the little girl’s mum. “Just to wish everyone a delayed [Christmas](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/christmas) and a Happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled. “We still have a long time still in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support. All our love.” The child has been in hospital since the November 23 attack – in which two other kids and three adults were injured. The special [GoFundme page](https://gofund.me/6b6f1e1e) was set up in the wake of the attack and as of last night has raised more than €58,000 for the child and her family. News of the girl’s improvement came as Riad Bouchaker, 50, of no fixed abode, made his second court appearance over the alleged attack. Mr Bouchaker is charged with three counts of attempted murder, one of producing and possessing a 36cm kitchen knife, three counts of assault causing harm and one of assault causing serious harm. He was remanded in custody yesterday to appear at Cloverhill District Court in west [Dublin](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/dublin) on January 25. The same court heard yesterday that he is to face trial in front of a judge and jury on the charges and a book of evidence is now being prepared.

    "text": "Autoridades exhortan a la población a no descuidarse de los aguaceros El país se encuentra en vilo ante la inminente llegada de una vaguada que podría traer consigo en los próximos días aguaceros tan intensos como los que asolaron al Distrito Nacional y otras zonas del país el año pasado, justamente el 04 de noviembre. Se pronostica que las precipitaciones podrían superar los 200 milímetros en tan solo 24 horas, lo que podría desencadenar inundaciones catastróficas y deslizamientos de tierra en zonas previamente afectadas. Las imágenes de la devastación del año pasado todavía están frescas en la memoria colectiva, y los expertos del Centro de Operaciones de Emergencias -COE- advierten que este evento climático podría ser significativo. “Hay muchas perspectiva de que este noviembre sea lluvioso, pero no tanto por los sistemas ciclónicos, sino más bien por los sistemas frontales porque ya entramos en el periodo frontal a partir de noviembre, o sea que esas masas de aire frío que se desplazan del norte, se encuentran con las masas de aire cálida que hay aquí en el Caribe y se generan esas precipitaciones intensas”, informó Gloria Ceballos, directora del Instituto Dominicano de Meteorología (Indomet). Ceballos explica que hoy viernes y mañana sábado los aguaceros continuarán generándose de manera intensa en todo el litoral norte. Desde la madrugada de hoy se presentarán lluvias débiles a moderadas con tormentas eléctricas y ráfagas de viento, sobre La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, Samaná, Puerto Plata, María Trinidad Sánchez, Espaillat y Hermanas Mirabal. En la tarde, las precipitaciones se intensificarán en las provincias antes mencionadas, y se extenderán hacia La Romana, San Pedro de Macorís, Monte Plata, Monseñor Nouel, La Vega, San Cristóbal, Monte Cristi y Santiago, entre otras cercanas. La funcionaria meteorológica indica que a partir del domingo las precipitaciones significativas se trasladarán hacia el litoral caribeño del país, que abarca provincias del sur (Pedernales, Barahona, Azua, Peravia, San Cristóbal y Santo Domingo, así como del este, San Pedro, La Romana y zonas aledañas). “No se descuiden” Las autoridades meteorológicas han emitido una advertencia radical ante la inminente llegada de torrenciales lluvias que podrían azotar varias regiones del país. El mes de noviembre se perfila como uno de los más intensos con relación a las precipitaciones, y los expertos insisten en que la población no debe subestimar la gravedad de la situación, recordando la devastación que provocaron las lluvias del año pasado. Con pronósticos que anticipan acumulaciones de hasta 200 milímetros, los organismos de emergencia han activado protocolos de prevención y respuesta. “Para nadie es un secreto lo que le acabo de señalar, con la naturaleza no hay forma de controlar las situaciones que pueden originarse (….) por eso les reitero no se descuiden”, señala Manuel Méndez, director del Centro de Operaciones y Emergencias –COE-. “Es importante que la población no se descuide. Recuerden ustedes que tenemos varios días de precipitaciones y alertas. Todas las lluvias que puedan caer a partir de este momento se convierten en correntias superficiales y provocan inundaciones ya sean urbanas o rurales, es decir crecidas de ríos, arroyos y cañadas”, advierte Méndez. En la costa Atlántica, se les recomienda a los operadores de frágiles, pequeñas y medianas embarcaciones, permanecer en puerto debido a viento moderado con ráfagas ocasionales y altas olas. Aunque no se prohíbe usar balnearios, como playas, el director del COE pidió que si no es necesario usarlos que no lo hagan, de hacerlo, recomendó bañarse en las orillas del mar. El director del COE Explica que se puede dar el caso que las autoridades se preparan para la caída de 50 milímetros de lluvias, pero puede caer 200 o 300 milímetros, “por eso se llama cambio climático y calentamiento global”. Además, aclara que las zonas vulnerables son creadas por la misma población que muchas veces construye en áreas, como las orillas de los ríos. 14 provincias bajo alerta amarilla y verde El Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia (COE) anunció que 13 provincias, y el Distrito Nacional, están bajo alerta por la incidencia sobre el país de una vaguada. Puerto Plata, María Trinidad Sánchez, Espaillat, Hato Mayor, El Seibo, Samaná, Duarte, Hermanas Mirabal y La Altagracia están en alerta amarilla. Mientras que bajo alerta verde están Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional, La Vega, Monte Cristi y Santiago. En ese sentido, el COE recomendó a las personas abstenerse de cruzar, ríos, arroyos y cañadas que presenten altos volúmenes de agua en las provincias bajo alerta. Manuel Méndez 50 milímetros (agua) en el Distrito Nacional te provoca inundaciones urbanas ¿y si te caen 200, 300 o 400, qué va provocar? Desastre” Gloria Ceballos Las lluvias de ahora son un ejemplo de cómo va estar este noviembre. Las lluvias más significativas van a estar en el litoral norte y noreste del país”",
