    "text": "When the weather drops below 70 degrees, Floridians are known for pulling out the boots and scarves.\nBut alligators, snakes, manatees and spiders don’t have a winter wardrobe, so how do they stay warm?\nNews 6 meteorologist Samara Cokinos went down the rabbit hole to find out and joined News 6 Chief Meteorologist Tom Sorrells on Talk to Tom to share the interesting and unusual ways they stay toasty .\nSpiders They do something similar to car manufacturers.\n“Spiders make their own so-called anti-freeze,” Cokinos said. “They have a chemical inside of their bodies that prevents ice from forming inside their bodies.”\nShe also warns they can be squatters, “Starting in September and October they start to be more active, you’ll see them out making webs and stuff and then all of a sudden you will notice them in your home. They are trying to come inside because it is getting colder and they need a place to be for shelter and of course, if they lay their eggs, your home is their home.”\nBirds They are more like us than you think.\n“They actually shiver — those muscle contractions actually allow for their body to maintain some type of heat or make heat, kind of like when we shiver, same type of thing that they are doing,” Cokinos said.\nAlligators These reptiles take advantage of the sun.\n“If you ever see an alligator in the winter out in the middle of open land, in the sunshine, mouth wide open, that’s exactly what it’s doing,” Cokinos said. “It’s regulating its temperature, because they are cold-blooded reptiles, they like to bask in the sun to regulate their internal temperatures. It doesn’t get any more Florida than that does it?\nFind every episode of Talk To Tom on YouTube:\nSnakes These cold-blooded creatures turn leaves into blankets.\n“If you are going to be collecting all the leaves that you just raked up, but they have been there for a few days, you may want to check that pile of leaves because snakes like to hide in those leaves because it also provides them warmth,” said Cokinos.\nShe also said they are a bit less active during the winter months, but could also pop up from under a downed tree.\nBears They get a thicker blanket, eat a big meal, and take a nap.\nCokinos pointed out, they grow thicker fur and start chowing down.\n“You’ll notice they’re looking a little extra fluffy and that’s because they eat more to pack on the pounds, so when they are less active in the winter they can conserve a lot of that energy and use that stored fat for energy,” Cokinos said. She said they also hibernate, though they don’t have to sleep for as long as their counterparts up north because our weather is not quite as cold as some of the more northern states.\nTo learn more about how Florida’s wildlife, including manatees, stay warm in the Winter check out Talk to Tom.

    "title": "Jayson Tatum’s father continues to question lack of playing time for his son on Team USA: “Why hasn’t he played?”",
    "text": "jayson-tatum The curious case of Jayson Tatum with Team USA has gained much traction on social media. JT was brilliant last season, leading the Boston Celtics to their first NBA Championship since 2008. As a result, Tatum rightfully earned a spot on Team USA&#039;s roster for the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, that&#039;s where the trouble started to begin for the 26-year-old. Sure, Tatum was available for the entirety of the tournament, but head coach Steve Kerr barely used his talents. Instead, he was either benched or given garbage minutes. It has caused a major uproar against Kerr. Jayson Tatum&#039;s father is bewildered by son&#039;s lack of playing time Team USA won the gold medal at the 2024 Olympics. Fans celebrated the win, but most are still focused on Tatum&#039;s lack of playing time during the gold medal-winning run. Now, Jayson Tatum&#039;s dad, Justin, has become the most recent person to question his son&#039;s lack of playing time on Team USA. &quot;As a coach, I would have no reservations of playing him,&quot; Tatum said. &quot;As a coach I would find a way to play him. Why hasn&#039;t he played? I don&#039;t see it.&quot; Justin spoke about playing his son from a coach&#039;s point of view. He believes it should have been a no-brainer to include the 2024 NBA champion in the rotation. For what it&#039;s worth, Tatum scored 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game for the Celtics last season. He struggled in a few games during the playoffs, but overall, he had a successful run. Tatum is still undecided over his next Olympic run The majority of the uproar over Tatum&#039;s seemingly being ignored by Kerr emerged after his DNP versus Serbia in the semifinals, so much so that the 5x NBA All-Star&#039;s mother openly expressed her disappointment. With Tatum and his family still having a tough time wrapping their heads around the 2024 Olympics experience, many are expecting the Celtics star to skip playing the competition in 2028. However, JT has ensured that he won&#039;t be making any decisions in the heat of the moment. &quot;If you asked me right now if I was going to play in 2028, it is four years from now, and I would have to take time and think about that. So I&#039;m not going to make any decision based off how this experience was or how I felt individually,&quot; Tatum said. As the 26-year-old star mentioned, the next Olympics are still four years away. Who knows what he&#039;ll do by then? But one thing is sure, JT won&#039;t be putting on Team USA colors without an assurance of a good role next time around.",

    "text": "Segundo o Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia), a previsão é de tempestades na Região Sul nos próximos dias. Entre sexta-feira (13) e domingo (15), novas áreas de instabilidade devem ocorrer, com rajadas de vento, pancadas de chuva e condição para granizo.\nEssa instabilidade atmosférica ocorre devido à combinação de calor, umidade e distúrbios no fluxo de vento altitudes elevadas, que favorecem a formação de uma grande área de baixa pressão. Entretanto, de acordo com o Inmet, ainda existem divergências sobre a intensificação desse sistema de baixa pressão, que pode evoluir para um ciclone extratropical próximo à costa do Rio Grande do Sul.\nO sul e leste gaúcho devem ser as áreas mais atingidas, com condições para rajadas de vento que superem os 60 km/h e pancadas de chuva eventualmente fortes. Na segunda-feira (16), o sistema deve se deslocar para o alto-mar.\nO Inmet solicitou o acompanhamento dos avisos meteorológicos especiais nos próximos dias. “Fique atento aos comunicados da Defesa Civil de sua cidade”, alertou.\nNa última semana, o novo sistema de alertas de desastres de grande perigo da Defesa Civil Nacional entrou em operação. O Defesa Civil Alerta utiliza a rede de telefonia celular para emitir alertas gratuitos, com mensagens de texto e alertas sonoros para a população que estiver em uma possível área de risco.\nOs alertas serão disparados pelas defesas civis de estados e municípios em área com cobertura 4g ou 5g, que tenham risco de alagamentos, enxurradas, deslizamentos de terra, vendavais, chuvas de granizo e outras situações. Não é necessário cadastro prévio para o recebimento das informações.",

Then Sepsis Rates Soared.\nProPublica’s first-of-its-kind analysis is the most detailed look yet into a rise in life-threatening complications for women experiencing pregnancy loss under Texas’ abortion ban.\nby Lizzie Presser, Andrea Suozzo, Sophie Chou and Kavitha Surana\nFeb. 20, 2025, 5 a.m. EST\nPregnancy became far more dangerous in Texas after the state banned abortion in 2021, ProPublica found in a first-of-its-kind data analysis.\nThe rate of sepsis shot up more than 50%\nfor women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester, ProPublica found.\nThe surge in this life-threatening condition, caused by infection, was most pronounced for patients whose fetus may still have had a heartbeat when they arrived at the hospital.\nProPublica previously reported on two such cases in which miscarrying women in Texas died of sepsis after doctors delayed evacuating their uteruses. Doing so would have been considered an abortion.\nThe new reporting shows that, after the state banned abortion, dozens more pregnant and postpartum women died in Texas hospitals than had in pre-pandemic years, which ProPublica used as a baseline to avoid COVID-19-related distortions. As the maternal mortality rate dropped nationally, ProPublica found, it rose substantially in Texas.\nProPublica’s analysis is the most detailed look yet at a rise in life-threatening complications for women losing a pregnancy after Texas banned abortion. It raises concerns that the same pattern may be occurring in more than a dozen other states with similar bans.\n...\n2 replies\n= new reply since forum marked as read\nTexas Banned Abortion.
