    "title": "杭州柯林2024年财报：营收激增168%，钙钛矿技术成新亮点",
    "text": "2025年4月2日，杭州柯林发布了2024年年报。报告显示，公司实现营业收入5.41亿元，同比增长168.23%；归属于上市公司股东的净利润为7303.86万元，同比增长54.72%。尽管业绩增长显著，但公司在研发投入和市场竞争方面仍面临挑战。\n　　 一、业绩快速增长，但研发投入不足\n　　杭州柯林在2024年实现了显著的业绩增长，营业收入和净利润分别同比增长168.23%和54.72%。这一增长主要得益于公司在机器人与智慧能源两大新兴市场的拓展。然而，尽管业绩亮眼，公司的研发投入却相对不足。报告期内，公司研发投入总额为4322.97万元，同比增长6.72%，在营业收入中占比仅为7.99%。这一比例在科技驱动型企业中显得偏低，可能影响公司未来的技术创新和市场竞争力。\n　　公司在数智感知产品研发方面取得了一定成果，如KLJC-02/51型激光声谱乙炔快速检测装置的成功研发和挂网试运行。然而，研发投入的不足可能限制了公司在其他关键技术领域的突破，如钙钛矿光伏技术的进一步研发和商业化应用。\n　　 二、钙钛矿技术取得突破，但商业化进程缓慢\n　　杭州柯林在钙钛矿光伏技术研发方面取得了显著进展，成功实现100MW钙钛矿大面积组件中试产线投产，并获得了全球权威检测机构TüV的认证。然而，尽管技术突破显著，钙钛矿组件的商业化进程却相对缓慢。报告期内，公司在屋顶光伏、光储充车棚、变电站BIPV等应用场景中实现了商业订单落地，但整体订单规模有限，尚未形成大规模的市场应用。\n　　公司在钙钛矿组件的材料改进、制备方法、封装工艺、生产装备等方面已申请专利14项，其中5项发明专利和2项实用新型已获授权。然而，专利的申请和授权并不等同于市场的广泛接受和商业化成功。公司需要进一步加大市场推广力度，提升钙钛矿组件的市场认知度和接受度，以加速商业化进程。\n　　 三、储能业务快速发展，但市场竞争加剧\n　　杭州柯林在储能业务方面取得了显著进展，自建的100MWh电化学储能电站成功并网，并交付了省外620兆瓦时电网侧储能系统订单。这些项目的成功实施不仅带来了可观的经济收益，也提升了公司在复杂项目交付中的技术、组织与执行能力。然而，随着储能市场的快速发展，市场竞争也日益加剧。\n　　公司在储能业务方面的技术积累和项目经验为其在市场中赢得了一定的竞争优势。然而，面对日益激烈的市场竞争，公司需要进一步提升技术水平和项目管理能力，以保持市场竞争力。此外，公司还需要关注储能技术的创 新和成 （ 002001 ）本控制，以应对市场变化和客户需求。\n　　总体来看，杭州柯林在2024年取得了显著的业绩增长，但在研发投入、钙钛矿技术商业化和储能业务市场竞争方面仍面临挑战。公司需要加大研发投入，加速技术创新和市场推广，以保持长期竞争优势。",

    "title": "Terrified family feared they'd die when Storm Gerrit tornado ripped house to pieces - Mirror Online",
    "text": "A family yesterday told how they feared they were going to die as a tornado ripped their home to pieces.\nGareth and Lyndsey Moody and three of their children had a lucky escape when the twister struck shortly before midnight on Wednesday. They scrambled to safety over bricks, timber and slates after the tornado ripped off their roof and sent rubble plunging into their rooms. The home was one of 100 damaged in ­Stalybridge, Greater Manchester , as Storm Gerrit brought havoc to parts of the UK.\nThree men died yesterday after a 4x4 vehicle they were in plunged into the River Esk near Glaisdale on the North York Moors The storm caused travel chaos with roads closed and ferries and flights cancelled, while 1,500 homes were still without power last night. Gareth and Lyndsey, both 45, were in bed when the twister hit.\nMum-of-four Lyndsey, an A&E nurse, said: “We were lucky to get out alive. We could be dead. The house started shaking. I went to the window, it was like it was sucking in and out. The whole ceiling came down. I screamed, the hallway gave way. The chimney came down and took out the rest of the house.”\nCouncil licensing officer Gareth added: “I went downstairs and heard a loud crash. The lights went out and there was another loud crash. It was mayhem. I ran back upstairs and saw a huge hole in the landing.” Two of the couple’s sons, Jack, 22, and Thomas, 15, were in their bedrooms when the roof and chimney collapsed.\nIt smashed into Jack’s bedroom and destroyed the bathroom, flooding the kitchen. Gareth said: “How they are alive I don’t know. We were clambering over stuff to get out.” Daughter, Rebecca Saycell, 20, and husband Thomas, 27, were in their bedroom in the basement. They managed to flee with their dogs , Phoebe and Penny and cat Jessica.\nAcross Stalybridge the tornado ripped off roof tiles, uprooted trees, knocked down walls and sent debris flying into parked cars. Resident Peter Hall was shocked to find a tree had landed on the windscreen of his car. Hayley McCaffer, from the nearby village of Carrbrook, said: “Some of the houses are a disaster, the roof missing, gable ends gone, cars squished.” The Met Office said a “supercell thunderstorm” had caused the damage.\nLib Dem transport spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse urged Rishi Sunak to call a Cobra meeting to tackle the chaos in the area. Around 1,500 properties in ­ Scotland were still without electricity yesterday. Heavy snow, high winds and rain, downed power lines. Some households will not be reconnected until later today.\nA string of train ­operators, including LNER and Avanti West Coast, suspended or axed services. Ferries between Dover and France were delayed and Heathrow Airport cancelled 18 flights on Wednesday. The fastest wind gusts were 86mph at Inverbervie, Scotland, 84mph at Fair Isle in ­Shetland, and 83mph at Capel Curig, North Wales. The Met Office warned of more strong winds and rain today and tomorrow. And police urged people in affected areas to only travel if necessary.",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | Ipswich Star",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",
