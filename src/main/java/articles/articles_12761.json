In Williamson County, the northwest corner of the county is now in the \"severe\" drought category, which is down from the \"extreme\" category.\nWhen looking at a statewide view of the drought, conditions have markedly improved, with all drought levels showing improving conditions. Most notably, north and east Texas, where most of the rain from the recent system fell, saw the biggest improvements statewide. The largest categorical improvement was in the \"abnormally dry\" category, where a five-percent decrease was observed. Additionally, areas not in a drought category increased by five percent as well. The \"moderate\" drought category also saw a large improvement, dropping by around 3.5% statewide.\nWith rain expected for the first week of 2024, we don't expect much change on the drought monitor for next Thursday's release, which will be the first of the new year. However, we'll be watching the monitor for January 11th, which will include next week's rainfall amounts.\nStick with KVUE for the latest as we track the potential for the drought to improve this winter with the El Nino pattern.\nIn the meantime, here's your seven-day forecast.",

    "title": "Thomas Merton’s Blueprint for a More Contemplative Life",
    "text": "Thomas Merton’s Blueprint for a More Contemplative Life\nBy age 25, my grandmother had accompanied her mother in marching for women’s suffrage, lived through World War I, survived the Great Depression, and served in the Navy during World War II. After she died in 2009, a box of her favorite books passed down to me, her youngest grandchild. I imagined the box would be filled with stories matching the pace of her early life. Instead, it only contained books written by Thomas Merton, her favorite being The Seven Storey Mountain, the trappist monk’s spiritual autobiography.\nWhat about the life a monk could appeal to a woman who lived through the 20th century’s most significant events? Subjects like spirituality and the interior life remain elusive by nature, but Merton’s story and works offer my grandmother’s generation and modern readers a guiding light on the journey for peace. As this year marked The Seven Storey Mountain’s 75th anniversary, it’s worth thinking through the life of a man whose influence would sprawl the likes of\nDorothy Day, Evelyn Waugh, and who almost held a retreat with Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination.\nBorn in 1915, Merton had an upbringing that paralleled my grandmother’s (and was in fact born just a year after her). From his early years to his time at Columbia University, Merton witnessed some of the major political, intellectual, and artistic movements of the 1930s. He frequented fervorous spaces, from communist meetups to anti-war protests. Some of his closest friends—the poet Robert Lax, the editor Robert Giroux, and the painter Ad Reinhardt—went on to be influential in the New York art scene. Merton’s college years teemed with thrills, love affairs, and partying in New York.\nIt’s tempting to romanticize this as a glamorous era, but Merton lamented this time of his life. “In devouring pleasures and joys,” he writes in The Seven Storey Mountain, “I had found distress and anguish and fear.” Despite his rich and varied experiences, Merton regarded this seemingly appealing life as an illusion: In gulping down the pleasures the world offered, he found himself still thirsty.\nprivacy policyand terms and conditions Sign In",

    "text": "La DANA que ha golpeado en los últimos días todo el litoral mediterráneo español sigue activa y en las últimas horas se ha situado en el mar al norte de la isla. Aemet ha elevado la alerta amarilla a naranja porque se prevén episodios de alrededor de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. El riesgo naranja permanecerá activo hasta las 20 horas de este viernes día festivo de Tots Sants. Las lluvias han descargado con fuerza en algunos puntos de la isla desde primera hora de la mañana, ya que la tormenta ha barrido buena parte de la isla. Sobre todo en la zona norte, con chubascos potentes en la zona de Sant Vicent, Sant Joan y entre Santa Agnès y Sant Mateu. Pero también se han producido lluvias intensas en otros puntos, como el Pla de Sant Antoni, en Santa Eulària hacia el interior e incluso en puntos aislados de Sant Josep y en la ciudad de Eivissa, donde se han producido algunas inundaciones. También en las últimas horas se han producido tormentas en Formentera. Se recomienda no estar en zonas inundables ni utilizar las carreteras, ya que es un fenómeno impredecible que puede descargar tormentas y provocar inundaciones en pocos minutos. Desde las 9 de la mañana también han descargado decenas de rayos en diferentes puntos de la isla. Aunque el grueso de la DANA sigue afectando desde anoche principalmente a la zona de Castellón y el Sur de Tarragona, se ha ido desplazando hacia el Mediterráneo y un frente está situado durante toda la madrugada y la mañana entre Ibiza y Mallorca. Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Ibiza, Formentera, Mallorca y Menorca.",

Unlock the Full Story for Free! Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Elijah Moore suffered a scary injury for the Cleveland Browns against the New York Jets on Thursday Night Football. It looked like an innocuous play as the wide receiver was tackled after a catch and run during the two-minute warning in the first half.\nBut his head slammed into the ground and he did not get up immediately. As the cameras zoomed in, showing his helmet having picked up a divot of the turf, he was seen making what looked like involuntary movements. It was immediately clear that it was serious and the play was stopped for more than a minute as the medical staff attended to him. Players from both teams, especially given Elijah Moore is a former Jets player, huddled on their knees around him.\nNote: Some can find the below video distressing, viewer discretion is advised\n•\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Expand Tweet Elijah Moore's injury update Elijah Moore, thankfully, could get up and walk on his own to the blue tent to be evaluated. But it was later confirmed that the head injury he suffered was enough to remove his involvement in the game.\nExpand Tweet It's tough news for the Browns, given they already have Amari Cooper missing. If Elijah Moore misses more time due to concussion protocol, it could have a detrimental effect on their offense.\nFormer Jets combine to bring joy to the Browns on TNF The loss of Elijah Moore came at a time when the Browns were dominant against the Jets. They were already leading 27-17, and soon it was 34-17.\nOne of the touchdowns was scored by the wide receiver from a pass from Joe Flacco . Both these players were with the New York Jets last season. In a retooled offense after acquiring Aaron Rodgers from the Green Bay Packers , they were deemed dispensable.\nYet, it is Cleveland that is on the way to the postseason. It is sweet revenge for the ex-Jets players but scoring when playing against them would have been the cherry on the top.\nWorryingly for the Browns, though, their injuries are now racking up. It is not just they are now down two of their best receivers for this game and maybe more, but it is all around. Joe Flacco is, of course, playing in place of Deshaun Watson , who is out for the season.\nAdditionally, after kicker Dustin Hopkins was injured in the game against the Houston Texans , they acquired Riley Patterson who missed both a field goal and a one-point conversion today. Their punter was also injured in the previous week. They are limping toward the postseason and they could catch up in the playoffs.",
