    "text": "Toronto plans to open a new site to help keep vulnerable residents warm when temperatures plunge further, the city said Monday after its four warming centres were at capacity over the weekend. Temperatures dropped in the city over the weekend and are forecast to stay low through the week. Warming centres across Toronto – located downtown and in the areas of North York and Scarborough – opened last week to provide walk-in access to a safe, warm place to rest and snacks for those who may be experiencing homelessness. The city's four warming centres have a combined capacity of a little less than 180 people. All four centres were at capacity over the weekend and the city said it is ready to open more spaces when temperatures drop to - 15 C. \"The city has identified one surge site to be activated when temperatures fall to -15 C, or during extreme weather events,\" city's spokeswoman Christy Abraham wrote in a statement Monday. People were seen entering and exiting a warming centre on a quiet downtown Toronto street near the city hall Monday afternoon. Abraham also said 10 drop-in providers, which offer a range of services including food, health care and showers to those experiencing or at risk of homelessness, have extended their hours for the winter. City teams are also providing blankets, sleeping bags, and warm winter clothing to those living outdoors, she said. \"When temperatures reach -15 C or colder, the city will dispatch additional street outreach teams to perform wellness checks and encourage people to come indoors,\" she added. Toronto has opened additional shelter space, expanded its warming centres' operations, and opened new 24-hour respite sites this winter, Abraham said. Diana Chan McNally, social worker and harm reduction advocate, said respite sites, which provide more services, are not always accessible to everyone because people have to call and register beforehand. Warming centres are more accessible, she said, but it's sometimes difficult for those experiencing homelessness to know where they are and when they are open. \"If it's just consistently open, people will know that no matter what, they can just go there instead of pondering: is it open, is it not? Has the location changed?\" she said. \"The more that you have consistent low-barrier space, the more accessible and safe it is for people.\" She said the city should make more warm spaces available for people who are homeless. \"If it's really cold out, people need to know that they can just come inside, even if it's crowded,\" she said. \"It's better than nothing, right, because otherwise those people, it's not like they disappear. They just end up on the (transit system) or they end up in the library and that's an even less appropriate space than a respite centre.\" City councillors had voted last year to lower the threshold for when warming centres will be opened to -5 C or when freezing rain, snow or storm warnings are issued. Warming centres opened last winter only when temperatures dipped to -15 C or -20 C in Toronto. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 15, 2024. Maan Alhmidi, The Canadian Press",

These include projects worth about Rs 11,100 crore for the development of Ayodhya and its surrounding areas and projects worth about Rs 4600 crore related to other projects across Uttar Pradesh. On Friday, PM Modi, in a post on X, stated, \"Our government is determined to develop world-class infrastructure, improve connectivity and preserve the rich heritage of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Shri Ram. In this direction, I will inaugurate the newly constructed airport and redeveloped railway station tomorrow. Along with this, I will also get the privilege of inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of many more development projects, which will make the lives of my family members in many areas of the country, including Ayodhya and UP, easier.\" Prime Minister Modi has broadly outlined his vision to develop modern, world-class infrastructure in Ayodhya, improve connectivity and revamp its civic facilities while also conforming to the rich history and heritage of the city. In realisation of this vision, a new airport, a new redeveloped railway station, newly redeveloped, widened and beautified roads, and other civic infrastructure are being inaugurated in the city. The foundation stones for a number of other new projects will be laid, contributing to the beautification and revamp of civic facilities in and around the temple town.",

    "text": "Ganadores: David Baker, Demis Hassabis y John M. Jumper Publicado a las 6:00 a.m. Para comprender la importancia del Premio Nobel de Química de este año, es necesario comprender las proteínas. Para la mayoría de nosotros, la proteína es la que encontramos en la carne o el tofu y debe consumirse en cada comida. Para los bioquímicos, son mucho más que eso. “Hay proteínas que se usan para nuestro cabello y proteínas que se usan para nuestros ojos. Hay proteínas que se utilizan para digerir el chuletón que comiste o para contraer los músculos. La proteína lo hace todo, todo, todo. Son las máquinas moleculares que hacen funcionar nuestro cuerpo”, explica Normand Voyer, amable director del departamento de química de la Universidad Laval. Se sabe desde hace mucho tiempo que las proteínas están hechas de 20 aminoácidos diferentes, es decir, bloques de Lego que pueden unirse en todo tipo de combinaciones para formar los aproximadamente 200 millones de proteínas que se han identificado hasta la fecha. Excepto que una proteína es más que una larga cadena de aminoácidos. Es una estructura que se despliega en tres dimensiones. “El misterio que siempre ha estado sin resolver es cómo una secuencia de bloques de aminoácidos se pliega para formar una proteína funcional”, explica el profesor Normand Voyer. Así lo han aclarado dos de los premios Nobel de Química 2024, Demis Hassabis y John Jumper. En 2020, los dos investigadores de Google DeepMind presentaron AlphaFold 2: un modelo de inteligencia artificial capaz de predecir la estructura tridimensional de una proteína a partir de su composición. “Con esto podemos entender, por ejemplo, por qué cuando cambiamos 1 aminoácido en una proteína que contiene 1.000, se crea un defecto que causa la fibrosis quística”, explica Normand Voyer. David Baker, de la Universidad de Washington, ha desarrollado modelos informáticos que permiten crear nuevas proteínas desde cero a partir de los mismos 20 bloques de Lego que son aminoácidos. “Abre la puerta a la síntesis de nuevos fármacos. O inventar proteínas que capturen CO2 », Ilustra Normand Voyer. El investigador asistió este año a una conferencia de David Baker en Kioto, Japón. “Fue sorprendente”, dice. Digamos que desea degradar el aceite usado para producir biocombustible. Con sus algoritmos, puedes diseñar, desde cero, una proteína que haga eso. Piénsalo: ¡está jodido! »",

    "text": "A shouting match erupted in the House Judiciary committee Thursday when a Democratic lawmaker dared Republicans to keep their promise to the American people and impeach President Joe Biden.\nA furious Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) challenged conservatives to either move forward with impeachment or give up the \"Anna Paulina lunacy\" that would see Republicans try to put Attorney General Merrick Garland under arrest.\n\"You've got nothing, nada, zero, zilch,\" Swalwell told Republicans. \"You're just screwing around now.\"\nEven Rep. James Comer (R-KY) admitted Thursday he was skeptical of, and confused by, a plan from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) to have Garland arrested for not turning over a recording of Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur.\n\"I will vote for it, but I don't think it's necessary,\" Comer\nsaid. \"I don't think anyone understands how it's going to work.\"\nALSO READ:\n‘Creepy weirdos’: Senator fears Trump WH staff would destroy government from ‘inside’\nSwalwell appeared equally skeptical of conservative's efforts to tarnish Biden's reputation when he egged them on during the committee meeting, promising to yield his time to anyone who could tell him when the impeachment would land.\n\"You promised the American people you were going to impeach President Biden,\" he said. \"So bring it. I'll yield. Bring it.\"\nRep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) took the bait and the two men immediately began shouting at each other.\n\"Do you have a vote Mr. Bishop?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Bishop shot back.\n\"Make the motion,\" Swalwell barked repeatedly as Bishop sputtered and finally snapped, \"Do you want me to answer you?\"\n\"You're a big man,\" Swalwell replied. \"You talk about impeaching the president, bring the motion.\"\n\"As soon as they stop stonewalling the investigation—\" Bishop began to say, but Swalwell lost patience.\n\"You got nothing,\" he said. \"You guys got nothing because Joe Biden has been acquitted and this is just a pathetic, pathetic postgame of an exercise that yielded nothing. This is embarrassing. This is embarrassing and it's a waste of time. You have people sitting in here who are wearing shirts that say 'Moms Demand Action.' Do you think moms are demanding impeachment? No. They want their kids to be safe in their classrooms from gun violence.\n\"You actually sit on a committee that can do that,\" Swalwell said. \"Come here and do something.\"\nWatch the\nvideo below or click here (Swalwell's remarks begin at the 59 minute mark).",
