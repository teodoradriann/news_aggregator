You need to deliver a top-notch experience to visitors, optimizing every element to ensure peak performance, maximum engagement – and more conversions.\nBut here's the catch: a subpar website can do more harm than good. It can push potential customers away, harm your brand's reputation, and ultimately, hamper your digital marketing strategies.\nThat's exactly why we've crafted the 'Ultimate Website Optimization Checklist for 2024'. It's your comprehensive guide to elevate your website’s performance and user experience.\nKeep reading to discover an easy breakdown of how to transform your website into a memorable (and profitable) online experience.\nYour CTA buttons need to pop off the page and make it crystal clear what you want your visitors to do next.\nHow Optimizing Your Website Can Boost Your Online Success\nThe goal of your website is to communicate your brand’s message, engage with your target audience, and drive conversions.\nThis is your digital hub, where visitors come to learn about your products and services, and why they should buy from your business.\nEvery part of your website needs to work towards these objectives – from design to content, functionality, and user experience.\nYour website also needs to be favored by search engines, so your target audience can find it when they look up search queries related to your business.\nNow, if you’re a business owner with limited time or technical experience, trying to optimize your website on your own could feel like a big, overwhelming task.\nWhere do you start? How do you start?\nNot to worry.\nWe’ve broken down the core tasks of website optimization into easy, actionable subtasks you can execute on your own.\nWebsite Optimization Strategies: Let’s Dive In\nThis guide includes key tips and website optimization tools you should use to improve your site.\nKey Essentials Before We Start:\nChoose a Reliable Hosting Provider\nA huge chunk of your site’s performance and security will depend on the hosting provider you choose.\nA good host ensures fast loading times, minimal downtime, and robust security, which are all essential for a positive user experience and search engine rankings. And a bad host? The total opposite – which will cost you a lot of money in the long run.\nWhen\nselecting a reliable hosting provider pay attention to speed, uptime guarantee, customer support availability, security features, and scalability.\nUse WordPress as Your Content Management System\nThere’s a common misconception that WordPress is hard to use for beginners, and non-techie users should opt for hosted website builders like\nWix, Webflow, Squarespace, or Weebly instead.\nBut WordPress is actually known for its simple usability and has far more benefits than any of the hosted site builders out there.\nIts learning curve is minimal and you don’t need to be an expert in HTML or CSS to build an impressive WordPress site.\nYou can use a wide variety of templates and plugins to create a business website, blog, professional portfolio, or any other site you’d like.\nWordPress is also written using high-quality code, making it easier for WordPress websites to be discovered by Google and other search engines.\nSo, if you’re looking to achieve the ultimate website optimization and stand out from the competition –\nyou need to use WordPress.\nAnd now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s dive into this checklist:\n1. User Experience (UX) Optimization\nUser experience determines how your website visitors interact with your website. Good UX makes a website easy and enjoyable to navigate, encouraging your audience to stay longer and engage more.\nThis increases user satisfaction, reduces bounce rates, and also strengthens your brand’s reputation – leading to more conversions.\nAlso, search engines favor websites with good UX, which can lead to better SEO rankings, more organic traffic, and more customers.\nThe key components of a good user experience are:\nNavigation Ease\nStraightforward, seamless navigation is the cornerstone of good UX. A well-structured navigation system helps your visitors find what they’re looking for quickly and without hassle.\nKey elements of navigation ease include:\nA clear, consistent main menu (usually\na dropdown menu) that serves as the roadmap for your website\nLogical, well-thought-out page organization that creates a natural, intuitive flow\nSearch baraccessibility (in the header, footer, and/or sidebar of the website)\nWell-organized content that can be navigated intuitively\nClean Website Layout and Design\nYour website’s layout and design are foundational to a good user experience.\nA visually pleasing design, combined with a clear, straightforward layout, makes your website engaging and easy to use.\nYour site layout and design should feature:\nA consistent color scheme\nHigh-quality images & videos\nReadable fonts\nClear call-to-action sections\nWhitespace usage\nConsistent branding elements (logos, motifs, etc.)\nNow, if you’re not well-versed in web design, you’ll struggle to build a website like this from scratch.\nBut with the right tools, you won’t even have to.\nThrive Theme Builder + Thrive Architect are the no-code, website building duo you need to build a clean, conversion-focused website your audience will love.\nThrive Theme Builder helps you create a great-looking site layout, along with the necessary core page templates you’ll need (\nhomepage, blog page layout, default blog post design, 404 page, etc.)\nOnce you’ve set up your theme, you’ll use Thrive Architect’s user-friendly drag-and-drop visual editor to customize your page templates to your exact liking.\nChoose from hundreds of landing page templates to add to your site and use our library of design elements to make them unique to your business.\nMobile Friendliness\nIn a world where our phones and tablets have almost become an extension of ourselves, having a mobile-friendly website is non-negotiable.\nWhen a visitor accesses your site through their mobile device, your site’s content and layout should adjust automatically, allowing for easy navigation and an enjoyable experience.\nIf you’re using Thrive Architect, you can optimize your pages and create a mobile version of your website in seconds.\nThrive Architect features a built-in “Responsive Design” feature that lets you manage the display of certain elements on the Desktop, Tablet, or Smartphone interfaces.\nAnd if you want to learn more key tips to build a responsive website, watch this tutorial from Tony:\nPage Loading Speed\nWebsites that load quickly meet user expectations for efficiency and immediacy.\nSlow-loading pages can lead to frustration and high bounce rates, as users are likely to leave a site that doesn’t load promptly.\nTo avoid a slow-loading website, you should:\nOptimize your images and videos\nEnsure none of your plugins are outdated\nUse a theme that is built with clean code and is updated regularly\nInstall a\nsite speed plugin(or tools found in Google Search Console) for additional assistance\nThrive Theme Builder also includes\na Website Speed Optimization tool to ensure your website loads fast.\nThis feature is automatically activated on your website, so you don't need to do anything here.\nOur site performance optimization tools are simple to understand and straightforward to use, so you can complete this setup in less than a few minutes.\n2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)\nYour well-designed website won’t be effective if your target audience can’t find it.\nSEO is important because, when done right, it increases your site’s visibility and boosts your chances of ranking higher on search engine results pages (SERPs).\nAnd it isn’t just about getting more eyes on your sight. It’s about attracting the right kind of traffic – people who are genuinely interested in what you have to offer.\nOn-page SEO Checklist: Optimize Your Content and Structure\nOn-Page SEO is critical for optimizing your website's content to help search engine crawlers (and algorithms) and actual searchers.\nUse SEO tools like\nWPBeginner Keyword Generator, Google Keyword Planner, or Ahrefs to start your keyword research& find relevant terms for your content.\nMake sure every piece of content has a unique title tag that includes the main keyword. Keep it under 60 characters.\nWrite an attention-grabbing meta description (130 to 150 characters), for every post and page, that includes the main keyword.\nUse headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure your content. Include your main keyword in your H1 header to highlight your page’s main topic.\nUse short paragraphs and bullet points to make your content easy to read and scan. Avoid using long-winding sentences, as well.\nDescribe the contents of your images using alt text, and use keywords where necessary (don’t forget to compress images for faster page load speeds)\nLink to other relevant posts or pages on your site (internal linking) and use anchor text that accurately describes the linked page's content\nKeep your post and page’s URLs simple – include the target keyword when you can\nOff-page SEO\nWhile on-page SEO is about optimizing the content on your website, off-page\nSEO strategy focuses on what happens outside of your site to improve your brand awareness, rankings, and authority.\nBuild quality\nbacklinks(link building) through guest posting, collaborating with other creators in your industry, and identifying broken linkson other websites (and offering your content as a replacement)\nRegularly post engaging high-quality content on social media platforms and link back to relevant posts on your website\nWork on your Local SEO if you have a physical business:\nCreate a\nGoogle Business Profile(formerly known as Google My Business) and keep it updated with accurate information and regular posts\nList your business in relevant local directories\nRespond to all your reviews on platforms like Google, Yelp, Amazon, etc. – both good and bad. This shows search engines you value your customers’ business and feedback.\nTechnical SEO\nTechnical SEO deals with the more technical aspects that impact your site's performance in search engines. This is about ensuring that search engines can easily crawl, understand, and index your site.\n- Make sure your website has logical structured data then this won’t be an issue\n- Use tools like\nGoogle PageSpeed Insightsor GTMetrix to optimize your site’s loading speed. Alternatively, a site speed plugincan assist with this too.\n- Secure your website with\nan SSL certificate. This encrypts data transmitted between your server and visitors' browsers, which is a factor that search engines consider for ranking. Create and submit a sitemapto search engines (Google, Bing Webmaster Tools, etc.) to help them crawl and index your site more effectively.\n- Add schema markup to your site to get rich snippets in Google searches\nOther important tasks include using robots.txt files wisely,\noptimizing your site’s core web vitals , checking for crawl errors, using heatmaps, and conducting regular technical SEO audits.\nIf you’re handling your site’s SEO on your own, this could become very time-consuming in no time. Especially if you aren’t knowledgeable on the ins and outs of SEO.\nTo make your job 100 times easier, we recommend using\na WordPress SEO plugin like All in One SEO, Yoast SEO, or Moz to optimize your website for search engines.\nOur top recommendation is All in One SEO:\nAIOSEO handles all the technical aspects of optimizing your website and provides key tips on\nhow to make your content SEO-friendly.\nThis plugin is easy to install, even easier to use, and will help you get your target audience in front of the right eyes, so you can convert them into leads and customers.\n3. Content Optimization\nNext up is your actual site content.\nThis is more than just filling your website with text. You need to focus on creating high-quality, relevant content that resonates with your audience and makes them want to stay on your website to learn more.\nKeyword Usage\nIntegrate relevant keywords naturally into your content marketing.\nThis includes using them in titles, subheadings, and throughout the body. But remember, it's not just about keyword quantity; relevance and context are key.\nTry use of long-tail keywords (with mid to low search volume) over shorter generic terms to to ensure your content matches your audience’s search intent.\nRegular Content Updates\nKeep your content fresh and up-to-date.\nThis shows search engines that your site is active and provides current information, which is an important ranking factor.\nRegular updates also give visitors a reason to come back and trust that your content is recent and relevant.\nMultimedia Elements\nBreak up text with high-quality images, videos, and infographics.\nMultimedia elements can make your content more engaging and shareable, offering a richer user experience.\nPlus, they can help explain complex topics in a more digestible format.\nIf you’re building your business on a budget, consider creating your own website images with affordable tools.\nAlways resize and\noptimize your images to avoid hampering your site’s load speed.\nReadability and Content Structure\nYour content should be easy to read.\nUse short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings to break up text. Ensure that the font size and style are comfortable for reading on various devices.\nA well-structured article not only keeps readers on the page longer but also makes it easier for search engines to understand your content.\nMake sure your pages and posts have the same design, to maintain design consistency. If you’re using Thrive Theme Builder and Thrive Architect on your site, this won’t be a problem.\nOne of your first steps when setting up your website is to select sitewide templates – e.g. default post and default WordPress page. When you make changes to these templates (e.g. color, font style, or size) these changes will automatically reflect on all existing posts and pages.\n4. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)\nCRO is all about tweaking your website to make it more likely for your visitors to do what you want them to do - be it buying a product, signing up for a newsletter, or filling out a contact form. It's crucial for turning the traffic you already have into real results for your business.\nClear Call-to-Action Buttons\nYour CTA buttons need to pop off the page and make it crystal clear what you want your visitors to do next.\nPhrases like 'Buy Now,' 'Sign Up,' or 'Learn More' should be front and center, begging for a click.\nIf you struggle with CTA section placement, we recommend using a\nlanding page builder with templates.\nThrive Architect features hundreds of landing page templates built with core CRO principles in mind.\nInstead of worrying about where to place what, all you need to do is replace the placeholder texts and images with your page copy, visuals, and links to your product pages, pricing pages, or content.\nUser-Friendly Forms\nThe easier your forms are to fill out, the more likely they'll get completed.\nKeep them simple, ask only for what’s necessary, and make sure each field is clearly labeled.\nIf you've got a multi-step form, showing a progress bar can encourage completion.\nYou can take things a step further by implementing advanced targeting techniques. This means enabling your forms to appear on certain pages, to ensure they appear in front of the right audience.\nTo do this, you’ll need a\nreliable form-building plugin. Thrive Leads, our lead-generation form plugin, features advanced targeting and a library of 400+ templates you can use to create attention-grabbing forms and popups that generate conversions.\nYou can purchase this plugin separately, or with Thrive Theme Builder, Thrive Architect and 7 other premium plugins when you purchase\nThrive Suite, the ultimate WordPress plugin bundle.\nTrust Signals\nBuild trust instantly by displaying testimonials, user reviews, and any certifications right where new visitors can see them.\nThis kind of social proof reassures them that they're making the right choice by choosing you.\nLike CTA sections, sometimes it’s hard to identify where to place testimonials and other social proof.\nBut all our landing page templates in Thrive Architect come with pre-placed testimonial sections, to make the design process much easier for you.\nScarcity Marketing Elements\nUse countdown timers or notes about limited availability to create a sense of urgency. It's about making your visitors feel they need to act now or risk missing out.\nThrive Ultimatum, our scarcity-marketing plugin, helps you create targeted countdown timers to get your audience to convert quickly. You also get access to this plugin when you purchase Thrive Suite.\nA/B Testing for Different Website Elements\nRegularly test different elements of your site, like headlines, CTAs, or images, against each other to see which ones perform better.\nA/B testing gives you hard data on what's working and what's not, allowing you to continuously refine and enhance the user experience and conversion potential.\nIf you’ve purchased Thrive Architect, you also get access to\nThrive Optimize, a user-friendly A/B testing plugin you can get started within minutes.\n5. Security Optimization\nIn a time where online threats have become more sophisticated, ensuring your website's security is non-negotiable.\nYour site’s security focuses on defending sensitive data from malicious attacks and maintaining the integrity of your online presence.\nWhen site visitors feel confident about their safety on your site, trust grows, which is fundamental for customer loyalty and retention.\nIn addition to using\n a security plugin to scan for malware and vulnerabilities, your site will also require the following:\nSSL Certificates\nAn SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate encrypts the data exchanged between your website and its visitors. It's a must for safeguarding personal information.\nYou can spot an SSL-secured website by the 'https' and padlock icon in the browser address bar – a sign that builds instant trust.\nTypically, an SSL certificate should be provided by your hosting provider. If not, then it might be time to consider a new host.\nRegular Software Updates\nWhether it's your website's CMS, theme, plugins, or scripts, keeping them up to date is crucial.\nUpdates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities.\nIn WordPress, you can manually update your theme and plugin or enable automatic updates.\nSecure Password Policies\nEncourage strong password practices for your website’s admin and user accounts.\nYou should also enable multi-factor authentication for an added layer of security.\nRegular Site Backups\nRegular backups of your website are a safety net.\nIn the event of a security breach or data loss, having up-to-date backups means you can restore your site quickly and with minimal damage. You’ll need a backup plugin to make this happen easily.\nDuplicator is your best bet. This plugin makes it easy to duplicate content on your website (pages, posts, etc.), back them up and migrate your website (if necessary).\n6. Analytics and Monitoring\nWeb analytics offer invaluable insights into how users interact with your site.\nFrom which pages they visit to how long they stay and where they drop off, these insights allow you to tailor your website to better meet user needs and achieve your business objectives.\nIn essence, analytics turn guesswork into targeted strategy, enabling continuous improvement of your site’s performance and user experience.\nSetting Up Google Analytics\nAs a starting point, set up Google Analytics on your website. It's a powerful, free tool that provides a wealth of data about your website's traffic, user behavior, and much more\nThe best way\nto set up analytics on your website is to use a WordPress analytics plugin.\nWe recommend using\nMonsterInsights.\nKnown for its outstanding ease of use and powerful feature set, this plugin makes it super simple for WordPress site owners to integrate Google Analytics with their sites – without needing to deal with any code.\nOnce installed, the MonsterInsights plugin offers a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard directly within your WordPress dashboard, allowing you to view complex analytics data in a clear, easily understandable way.\nThis powerful tool also offers a wide range of in-depth tracking features – putting it far ahead of its competitors.\nYou can use this plugin to observe real-time stats, e-commerce tracking, form submissions, and custom dimensions tracking.\nWhether you’re a WordPress beginner or an advanced user, MonsterInsights will help you make the right kind of data-driven decisions without struggling with Google Analytics' native interface.\nBest Practices\nMake it a habit to regularly check your analytics.\nConsistent monitoring helps you spot trends, identify issues, and recognize successful elements of your site.\nKey metrics to focus on include:\nTraffic Sources: Understand where your visitors are coming from – organic search, social media, direct visits, or referral sites.\nUser Engagement: Metrics like average session duration, pages per session, and bounce rate give you an idea of how engaging your content is.\nConversion Rates: Track how well your site achieves its goals, whether it's making sales, generating leads, or encouraging sign-ups.\nPage Performance: Identify which pages are performing well and which aren't.

    "text": "Desde aproximadamente el mediodía de este jueves, 25 de abril, se registraron protestas en Ciudad Bolívar, al sur de Bogotá. Un grupo de manifestantes con rostros cubiertos incendió un bus del SITP en la sede tecnológica de la Universidad Distrital.TransMilenio informó que tanto los pasajeros como el conductor fueron forzados a abandonar el vehículo. Por el momento, no se han reportado heridos. También han expresado su condena a estos actos de vandalismo.Videos del bus quemándoseEn las redes sociales circulan varios videos que muestran a los encapuchados dañando el autobús del SITP.La Secretaría de Movilidad indicó que las protestar se realizaron en ambas sedes de la Universidad Distrital en Bogotá, es decir, en la sede de la Macarena, ubicada en la avenida Circunvalar con calle 26C, dirección sur-norte.Además, en la sede Tecnológica se ha reportado un bloqueo en la intersección de la avenida Gaitán Cortés con avenida Villavicencio. Las autoridades acudieron al lugar para disuadir a los encapuchados y retomar el control en estos puntos.¿Cómo quedó el bus?Se conoció la imagen del bus del SITP que fue incendiado por manifestantes en la sede Tecnológica de la Universidad Distrital en Ciudad Bolívar. En la fotografía se puede observar que solo quedó el \\\"esqueleto\\\" del vehículo, es decir, todo su interior se destruyó por completo.¿Por qué protestan los estudiantes?Los estudiantes de la Universidad Distrital, en la sede ubicada en la localidad de Santa Fe, realizaron un plantón pacífico en donde expusieron su inconformismo por la escasez de recursos de este centro educativo y el deterioro de varias de las aulas de clases y las áreas sociales.Las mayores afectaciones están en la facultad de biología y sus laboratorios.“Son varias problemáticas, principalmente temas de la financiación, nos preocupa la falta de docentes y las salidas de campo, necesitamos eso como estudiantes de biología, es pertinente tener calidad en la docencia”, afirmó Duvan Muñoz, estudiante de Biología.",

    "text": "Santa Anita enjoyed a huge afternoon on Tuesday with an all-sources handle of $18.3 million, but no one had a bigger day than trainer Mark Glatt\nas the Arcadia track opened the gates on its 49-day Classic Meet.\nThe handle was Santa Anita’s best ever among a total of 17 opening dates held on a Tuesday and Glatt tied a personal one-day high with three victories,\nincluding the $200,000 Grade II Mathis Mile with Watsonville.\nGlatt, 50, is in the midst of a career year, winning with 20% of his 377 starters for earnings of $4.7 million, eclipsing his previous high of $4.2 million in 2022. He took out his trainer’s license in 1994 at age 21 and his mounts have earned more than $2 million in nine of the past 10 years.\nHe woke up Tuesday morning expecting a productive afternoon, but he might have surpassed even his own expectations. He had horses in four of the 11 races and won three of them. In horse racing, 75% is Hall of Fame stuff.\n“I thought they all had very good shots and it turned out that way,” Glatt, a Monrovia resident, said during a telephone interview Thursday.\nGlatt’s big day began in the fourth race with Judge Miller, a 3-year-old colt who broke his maiden by three-quarters of a length as the 3-5 favorite while running the 7 furlongs in 1:22.17.\n“He’s a young, inexperienced horse that’s still learning how to run,” Glatt said. “It was a distance that’s probably not all that compatible to him, but given his ability I thought he would overcome any of those things going in and he did. We were extremely confident with him.”\nGlatt said the next logical step for Judge Miller, a son of two-time Horse of the Year Curlin, will be to climb up the condition class ladder later in the meet.\nBeef Winslow gave Glatt a training double in the seventh, a $67,000 allowance race down Santa Anita’s famed downhill turf course. The 5-2 second choice, a 4-year-old gelded son of Honor Code, won going away by 3¼ lengths.\n“Since I claimed the horse (for $32,000 on Aug. 24 at Del Mar) I have teetered with is he a better two-turn horse or one-turn horse,” Glatt said. “He had never run down the hillside course and there are certain horses that you get a good feeling about running down the hill and trying it. I didn’t know if he was quite good enough at that level. He was coming up in the ranks, but I thought his style of running would be very conducive to the hillside course and he really ran well.”\nFlavien Prat was aboard for Glatt’s first two winners. The duo wins at nearly a 30% clip when they team up.\n“He’s an excellent rider, he’s very talented, and he’s a little bit like myself, kinda no-nonsense,” Glatt said. “Just kinda there to do the job. He’s very honest, has a good opinion after a race whether you win or lose. He’s able to help you with things that you might not necessarily be able to see out there with a horse. You’re gonna get 110% every time you have him on.”\nGlatt capped his big day with Watsonville in the Mathis Mile, edging 3-5 favorite Almendares by a nose as the 9-2 third choice. The 3-year-old Jack Milton colt went into the race off a fourth-place finish in the Grade I Hollywood Derby at Del Mar on Dec. 2.\n“I think it was a little easier race than what he had faced the last couple of starts,” Glatt said. “I felt good about, at least for the time being, shortening up in distance a little bit (1-1/8 miles to a mile on the grass). He’s young, a little bit scatterbrained. He’s still learning how to run even after a number of starts over the past six to eight months. I certainly wasn’t surprised (by the victory). I thought the bettors had it correct. I thought on paper maybe he was the third best horse.”\nAntonio Fresu returned to ride Watsonville and has been aboard the colt for all three of his victories. The Glatt-Fresu tandem wins at a 24% clip.\n“He tries hard, he works hard in the morning,” Glatt said of Fresu. “He’s got a pretty good opinion. He particularly rides the turf really well. Horses run for him. We’ve been pretty successful together. He’s done well since coming to the U.S.”\nGlatt will try to add to his stakes success Saturday when he sends out I’m A Gambler in the $200,000 Grade II Joe Hernandez Stakes down the hillside turf course with Frankie Dettori in the saddle. The 4-year-old gelded colt by No Nay Never is 5-1 on Jon White’s morning line.\nFollow Art Wilson on X @Sham73",

    "title": "Plant These 15 Bulbs in October for a Beautiful Spring Garden",
    "text": "Contents\nYou must work in the fall if you want a yard full of tulips and daffodils in spring. Fortunately, the weather in October is cool and comfortable and perfect for spending a day or a weekend outdoors to plant those bulbs in the ground.\nMany of the bulbs that sprout in spring require a cold period to do so. But that’s only one reason to plant them now. If you miss the window, you can cold-stratify indoors, but your bulbs will miss out on valuable root development.\nPlanting in the fall means that your bulbs will already have some root establishment in the spring. This means they can focus energy on the best and biggest blooms they can produce. Here are some gorgeous blooming bulbs that you can plant in October for an enviable springtime garden.\nTulip ‘Artist’ This compact flower showcases bold orange petals with green streaks. botanical name Tulipa ‘Artist’ sun requirements Full sun height 12” hardiness zones 3-8 Tulips are always a winner when it comes to spring-blooming bulbs. ‘Artist’ is literally an award winner, taking home the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society. It’s easy to see why. This classic, single-petal bloom is a Viridiaflora variety.\n‘Artist’ has bold orange petals with green streaks radiating from the heart toward pointed ends. The green in the petals matches the blue-green leaves and ties things together marvelously. This is a compact tulip that makes an excellent border.\nMuscari ‘Fantasy Creation’ This variety features intricate blue-violet double flowers with texture. botanical name Muscari armeniacum ‘Fantasy Creation’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 6”-8” hardiness zones 3-9 ‘Fantasy Creation’ is not what you might expect from a muscari or grape hyacinth. Typically, these plants have small, smooth, rounded flowers in grape-like clusters. This variety has a more textural appearance.\nThis muscari has double flowers, which alters its appearance significantly. Tiny, intricate blue-violet blossoms have a pompom texture. They open from lime green buds and bloom for a long period. They rarely set seed but will naturalize easily.\nDaffodil ‘Pink Charm’ Delicate snow-white petals surround a warm peachy center in this variety. botanical name Narcissus large-cupped ‘Pink Charm’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 1’-2’ hardiness zones 3-8 The American Daffodil Society agrees with me on this wonderful variety. ‘Pink Charm’ earned their Wister Award for being the most innovative daffodil of the year. Slender and delicate, these pretty blooms rise above shorter plants at about 18 inches.\nThe blooms are stunning in their simplicity. Six perfectly shaped snow-white petals surround a peachy-pink cup. A small, prominent cluster of stamens boosts the center’s warm golden glow.\nAllium ‘Ambassador’ This towering cultivar features large globes of star-shaped flowers. botanical name Allium ‘Ambassador’ sun requirements Full sun height Up to 4’ hardiness zones 4-8 While we are on the topic of award winners, this allium is a winner of the RHS Award of Garden Merit. This prestigious recognition is given to only the best and most beautiful plants. Alliums are members of the garlic family and are easy to cultivate and drought-tolerant.\n‘Ambassador’ is a massive cultivar, towering up to four feet tall. Large globes made up of hundreds of star-shaped, purple flowers adorn the top of tall stems. The flower heads are fantastical and long-lasting, blooming into the early summer.\nDutch Iris ‘Blue Diamond’ With a delightful scent, this easy-care flower attracts bees. botanical name Iris x hollandica ‘Blue Diamond’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20”-24” hardiness zones 5-9 Dutch irises appear so delicate and birdlike. In reality, they are low-maintenance and easy-to-grow additions to the spring garden. Just give them properly draining soil and, in warm climates, a bit of shelter from afternoon exposure. This will extend the life of their flowers.\n‘Blue Diamond’ is the most wonderful shade of pale indigo with brilliant yellow accents. Expect to see plenty of native and honey bees visiting these pretty blooms. They have a soft, sweet scent and make incredible cut flowers. Plant in October to get these bulbs established for years to come.\nCrocus ‘Blue Pearl’ This luminous variety naturalizes beautifully, enhancing spring gardens. botanical name Crocus biflorus ‘Blue Pearl’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 3” hardiness zones 3-8 Crocuses are great naturalizers. Once they are in the garden, don’t be surprised to see them popping up here and there in the coming years. They are great little bulbs to sow throughout your lawn as they will pop up and flower before you need to mow.\n‘Blue Pearl’ is a luminous variety with pale blue and white blooms. The shade is nearly opalescent. Before they open, the blue appears as vertical stripes on white buds, slowly lightening as they open. Mix these with a purple or pure white ‘Jeanne d’Arc’ for a simply stunning effect.\nSpring Snowflakes These delicate blooms bring charm and elegance to gardens. botanical name Leucojum vernum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 8”-10” hardiness zones 3-9 Named for their delicate appearance and early blooming habit, spring snowflakes are similar in appearance to snowdrops. Rather than pure white, rounded flowers, this plant’s blooms are also down-turned but bell-shaped, with small green spots at the tips of its petals.\nThe RHS agrees that this is a fine specimen and awarded it the Award of Garden Merit. If you see a pattern here, there is one! I’m only giving you the very best on this list. Mix your snowdrops and snowflakes together for a charmingly subtle shift in appearance.\nHyacinth ‘Apricot Passion’ This captivating variety brings both beauty and fragrance to gardens. botanical name Hyacinthus orientalis ‘Apricot Passion’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 8”-12” hardiness zones 4-8 If the scent of hyacinth isn’t enough to make you plant these bulbs, the beauty of this cultivar certainly will be. ‘Apricot Passion’ is enchanting in the palest shade of apricot blush around. You must add this to your beds if you’re a cutting gardener.\nHyacinths are easy to grow and have some of the strongest-smelling blooms of spring—or any season, for that matter. Add these blushing beauties to any spot. The soft shade goes with everything.\nGlory of the Snow ‘Luciliae’ Early spring brings delightful star-shaped flowers to gardens. botanical name Chionodoxa luciliae sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 3”-6” hardiness zones 3-8 If you plant their bulbs in October, Glory of the Snow pops up alongside crocus and snowdrops as one of the earliest spring bloomers. Adorable star-shaped flowers spring up amongst grassy foliage, which sometimes pops up before the snow entirely disappears.\nThese sweet plants have retreated underground by late spring, waiting for the next year. This species has blue-violet blooms with a white star in the center. It’s named for the wife of Swiss botanist P. Edward Boissier who honored his beloved with this gesture.\nAnemone ‘Blue Shades’ Charming denim blue flowers add beauty to shaded gardens. botanical name Anemone blanda ‘Blue Shades’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 3”-6” hardiness zones 5-8 Sweet, little anemones are commonly overlooked when folks mention spring bulbs. They are a smaller species than those we typically see in floral arrangements. They rarely grow taller than eight inches. Also known as the Grecian windflower, they are charming and subtle members of the spring garden.\n‘Blue Shades’ blooms in denim blue with daisy-like flowers with yellow centers. It is ideal for a woodland border or semi-shade garden spot. It prefers moist soil that is rich in organic material.\nSnowdrop ‘Hippolyta’ This unique variety features ruffled green and white petals. botanical name Galanthus nivalis ‘Hippolyta’ sun requirements Partial to full shade height 5”-8” hardiness zones 3-9 For those shadier spots in the garden, consider planting snowdrop bulbs in October to bring a lovely woodland feel in spring. As sweet as can be, these little lovelies pop up before the snow melts to be one the earliest bloomers of the year.\n‘Hippolyta’ is a marvel. If you love the classic, this might overwhelm you, but if you love an update, this is the one! Between the typical three pure white petals lies a cluster of tiny, green, ruffled petaloids with touches of yellow here and there. This isn’t your average snowdrop.\nEnglish Bluebells Delicate blue blooms create a fragrant springtime delight. botanical name Hyacinthoides non-scripta sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 1’-2’ hardiness zones 5-8 Sweet-smelling English bluebells are a perfumer’s dream. This vigorous grower naturalizes easily to form a beautiful colony of fragrance and beauty. Slender, gently weeping stems support nearly a dozen tiny, bell-shaped blooms above grasslike foliage.\nPlant these bulbs in partial or full shade areas for best results. They pair perfectly with snowdrops. Enjoy the sweet perfume and delicate blue blooms in early spring.\nHimalayan Foxtail Lily Tall spires of white blooms add elegant garden drama. botanical name Eremurus himalaicus sun requirements Full sun height 4’-6’ hardiness zones 5-8 If you’re looking to add some drama to your flower beds, foxtail lilies are just the thing! Tall and slender, these towering beauties know how to attract attention. At heights of up to six feet tall, these look great mixed into the mid-ground of your beds.\nThe Himalayan foxtail lily has tall spires of snowy white blossoms. It coordinates with any color scheme and looks wonderfully classy and chic in any spring garden. Plant these bulbs in October to ensure sufficient root development and cold exposure.\nRanunculus Telecote ‘Salmon’ Multi-tonal blooms create stunning arrangements in warmer gardens. botanical name Ranunculus asiaticus Tecolote ‘Salmon’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 18”-24” hardiness zones 8-10 It’s important to note that ranunculus is not especially cold-tolerant. This one is only for gardeners in Zones 8-10. North of these zones, plant your corms in the spring. In warm climates, put them in the ground as soon as possible for the longest blooming season.\nTecolote ‘Salmon’ is a stunning variety with multi-tonal blooms. Layers upon layers of delicate petals make these an amazing addition to cut arrangements. In cold climates, grow them annually and store bulbs between summer and spring.\nAsiatic Lily ‘Elodie’ This pollen-free lily offers stunning blooms for cutting gardens. botanical name Lilium ‘Elodie’ sun requirements Full sun height 6″-12″ hardiness zones 3-8 This wonderful Asiatic lily isn’t just stunning—it’s pollen-free! Its large, soft pink, double-petaled blooms make it a magnificent plant for the cutting garden. The flowers are a long-lasting florist’s dream.\nAlthough they bloom closer to the end of spring, this bulb is best planted in the fall around October. I can’t think of a single reason not to run out and buy these right now! Happy planting!",

    "title": "Marathon singing, vigils and pre-dawn processions as Filipinos celebrate Holy Week",
    "text": "MANILA: As Christians around the world celebrate Holy Week, Filipinos are observing their unique traditions, which will culminate on Sunday with Easter — the joyous commemoration of Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead.\nIn the largest Christian-majority nation in Asia, where over 85 million people identify as Catholic, folk traditions have blended with more than 300 years of Spanish colonial influences, leading to unique expressions and observances of faith.\nOne of the most enduring yet extreme examples is senakulo, a street drama that depicts Jesus’ passion and death, where men flagellate and, in some cases, nail themselves to the cross as an act of penance.\nBut not all Filipino Catholics adhere to these practices, instead engaging in other traditions.\nThey began the observance of Holy Week with Palm Sunday last week, when churchgoers brought palm branches to be blessed by priests.\nThe palm branch symbolizes victory, peace and eternal life and once they receive blessing, Filipinos put them up at home either as decor or by windows or doorways to ward off bad spirits.\nThey represent the branches that according to the Gospel crowds laid down as Jesus entered Jerusalem a few days before his crucifixion.\n“The Holy Week allows me to impart the importance of this occasion to my children, now that they’re a little bit older,” said Edgie Ruiz for whom the annual holiday is an opportunity to reconnect with loved ones.\n“This is also the time when our relatives who live far away come to spend time with us, which is something I always look forward to.”\nThe bulk of religious traditions begin on Holy Thursday, the day during Holy Week that commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus. It is observed with a custom during which the priest washes the feet of 12 people — imitating the humility of Jesus, who washed the feet of his apostles on the night before his crucifixion.\nRuiz was one of those chosen to take part in the ritual at his local parish in Hermosa, Bataan province.\n“My grandfather used to participate in this tradition as one of the chosen ‘apostles,’” he said. “The priest chooses common, everyday people to take part.”\nAnother tradition on Holy Thursday is the Visita Iglesia — visiting at least seven different churches to pray.\nGerald Gloton, who resides in Pampanga province 83 km north of Manila, has been practicing the Visita Iglesia tradition since childhood.\n“The Visita Iglesia is very important for me because it unites our family. We visit various churches that depict the importance of faith, heritage, and culture,” he said.\nPampanga is known for its strong Catholic traditions, including several historical churches dating back to the Spanish colonial period — another aspect that Gloton looks forward to in this annual ritual.\n“Aside from the spiritual reflection and family bonding, I also look forward to the intricate details and architecture of our churches which are regarded as structural treasures,” he said.\nAnother centuries-old tradition that continues to be practiced is the pabasa — a marathon reading of the passion of Christ, sung by volunteers, usually women, in their parishes. In urban places like Manila, the pabasa can run for more than a day, but in rural areas and places with intact traditions like Pampanga, it can go on for nearly a week.\nWhile some Filipino communities have adopted Western practices such as hunting Easter eggs on Sunday morning, one of the most anticipated rituals is the salubong, or welcoming, a pre-dawn Easter ritual in which a solemn procession of the images of the mourning Virgin Mary and a risen Christ meet from opposite ends in front of a church.\nA chorus of children, sometimes singing from hanging platforms to give the illusion of flying in mid-air, sing to herald the occasion. A child is assigned to lift the black veil off Virgin Mary, signifying the end of her mourning.\nFor Crystal Arcega from Batangas, south of Manila, the ritual’s atmosphere is the most joyous of all.\n“It’s when the baby angels throw confetti and wave their wands, and the choir sings. That’s when the Easter Mass starts, and the church lights are turned on,” she said.\n“It’s a beautiful moment and worth waking up early for.”\nAfter Easter Mass, Filipino families will gather over celebratory meals and delicacies.\nThe rice cakes sold in front of churches, such as the suman and tamales — delicacies wrapped in banana leaves — are a must-have after the mass.\nAt home, they are followed by fried chicken, braised meat dishes in a tangy-sweet sauce, and kare-kare — a rich oxtail peanut stew.\nThe most sacred period in the liturgical year in Christianity, which is filled with mourning, prayers and fasting to culminate in togetherness and feast, is for many a time that strengthens their faith.\nFor Arcega, it is a “way to remind us how much sacrifice Jesus has made, and how despite being in the form of man, is able to show us God’s unconditional love,” she said.\n“It really becomes the time for me to reflect and be thankful.”",

    "title": "Resident at country club calls duck killings 'bloody nightmare'",
    "text": "Some residents at Aberdeen Golf and Country Club near Boynton Beach are upset over how they’ve seen some staff there treating ducks. Janet Pelosi Diamond, who has lived at the club for more than two decades, called WPTV after she said a morning moment of peace overlooking the golf course was quickly stained after she realized a family of ducks she had seen grow up was lying dead on a field. \"I was beside myself at what I was seeing,\" Pelosi Diamond said. \"When I walked over there, there was blood all over the place.\" She said once she saw what was going on at the golf course behind her home, she had to record it. \"I don't think a lot of people know what's going on at the country club,\" Pelosi Diamond said. \"What I saw I thought was just so disgusting, so horrible, for the animals who are struggling to make it and to survive at a beautiful location, and they just turned it into a bloody nightmare.\" She said it's sad to see ducks that she's watched grow into a lovely flock suddenly be killed. \"I watched these ducks grow up,\" Pelosi Diamond said. \"I watched the mom with the little babies. I watched them struggling to survive each day, and they have, until someone decided that they needed to be removed. This isn't removal. This is killing.\" She said this all happened Thursday morning at the club. WPTV contacted the administration at the club who said they've hired a licensed trapper who removes nonnative invasive species. After WPTV showed the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission the video, they said the ducks are muscovies — an invasive species. The FWC said these types of ducks can be shot as long as it's during daylight hours while using non-toxic bullets on private property. Regardless of the legality of this issue, Pelosi Diamond said this is unacceptable. \"It's a lovely place to live, and I want it to stay a lovely way to live,\" Pelosi Diamond said. \"This has just really put a bloody mark on the community.\" She said some neighbors are planning on speaking to the administration to demand the ducks be treated humanely.",
