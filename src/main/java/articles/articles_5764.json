    "text": "Space Setbacks and Freshwater Crisis: Unveiling Today's Science News\nIndia's ISRO delays space docking experiment due to excess drift, while V. Narayanan becomes its new chief. The European Space Agency retains cooperation amid Italy's independent moves. A study reveals the extinction threats to 24% of the world's freshwater species, highlighting environmental challenges.\nIndia's space mission ambitions faced another hurdle as the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) postponed its highly anticipated docking experiment for the second time. The agency reported excessive drift between the satellites as the issue but has yet to announce a new date for the test.\nMeanwhile, the European Space Agency reassured on Thursday that collaborative efforts remain stable, despite Italy's independent strategy on rocket operations and potential satellite agreements with Elon Musk's Starlink. Italy's Avio is set to manage the Vega C rocket, shifting from Europe's primary launcher, Arianespace.\nIn leadership updates, India has appointed rocket scientist V. Narayanan as ISRO's new chief, succeeding S. Somanath. On the environmental front, a study brings to light the threats facing freshwater species, with 24% of assessed species at risk of extinction, prompting urgency for conservation measures.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "Sections Highlight María Arrabal / SUR Marbella Friday, 29 December 2023, 13:32 Compartir Some 2,000 staff at Hospital Costa del Sol in Marbella - plus the associated, smaller public hospital centres in Benalmádena and Estepona and the CARE treatment centre in Las Lagunas, Mijas Costa - will finally have their salaries brought into line with those of the rest of the SAS Andalusian health service from January. Up to now, doctors, nurses, orderlies and administrative staff doing the same jobs in these Costa del Sol centres have had different salaries to other local hospitals. Previously these hospital centres were part of a separate, quasi-independent public body, different to the main health service. This arrangement was ended in late 2021 and the Costa del Sol hospital, which celebrates 30 years today (29 December), was merged with the rest of the service. However it has taken until now to complete all the legal steps to bring all the contracts and terms and conditions in line with other hospital centres in the region. Staff had been protesting about how long it has taken. Hospital Costa del Sol opened on 29 December 1992 and covers municipalities from Manilva to Fuengirola. Since 2022 Benalmádena falls under Malaga's Virgen de la Victoria hospital. Publicidad Publicidad Te puede interesar Publicidad Publicidad Necesitas ser suscriptor para poder votar.

    "text": "VICTORIA — Opposition BC United Leader Kevin Falcon says he wants to prevent people convicted of dangerous criminal offences from legally changing their names. Falcon has tabled a private member's bill in the legislature to amend the British Columbia Name Act after learning convicted child-killer Allan Schoenborn was recently permitted to legally change his name. Schoenborn was found not criminally responsible because of a mental disorder for the 2008 killings of his three children in Merritt, B.C., and has changed his name, but his new identity has not been made public. Falcon says the NDP government has the power under the Name Act to prevent name changes, but did not do that with Schoenborn, who has been held at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Coquitlam, B.C., since 2010. Falcon says the Opposition's Name Amendment Act, if passed, would automatically prevent people designated as a dangerous or long-term offender under the Criminal Code from filing applications to change their name. Premier David Eby said earlier he will look at the current name-change legislation because people should not be able to evade responsibility for criminal offences by changing their names.
