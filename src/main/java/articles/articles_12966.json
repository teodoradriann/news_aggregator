    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

    "title": "Dancing the tango can relieve chemo-induced neuropathy in survivors, study finds | Fox News",
    "text": "Dancing it out can be a great way to recover from chemo. That's according to new research from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, which found that dancing the tango can boost neurological recovery in cancer patients by reducing lingering symptoms of chemotherapy.Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN) is a condition that can occur anywhere throughout the body, but mostly impacts the hands, feet and limbs, according to an OSU press release. EXPERIMENTAL WOMEN'S CANCER DRUG BOOSTS SURVIVAL RATES IN NOTABLE STUDY Eighty percent of breast cancer survivors experience CIN, which can cause pain, falls, difficulty walking and diminished quality of life, experts say. Previous data showed that music and exercise can \"help prevent neurologic degeneration,\" the researchers said. (iStock) The DAANCE study assessed how the adapted Argentine tango can help restore mobility and alleviate symptoms like numbness, burning, tingling and loss of feeling in these problem areas.The study, led by Lise Worthen-Chaudhari, PhD, a scientist in the OSU Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, was funded by the National Institute on Aging. POPULAR COFFEE ALTERNATIVE MAY HELP PREVENT CANCER, SAY EXPERTS Worthen-Chaudhari, a former dancer herself, expressed the need for alternative treatment options for CIN. The researcher and her team designed the study for breast cancer survivors experiencing CIN who had received their last chemotherapy treatment at least three months prior.In the early stages of the study, the researchers found that small doses of social dance improved dual-task function compared to larger doses of at-home exercise .This could be due to the cognitive engagement of dual-task functioning, the researchers concluded. The Argentine tango, a social dance that originated in Argentina, requires cognitive engagement. (iStock) Just 20 minutes of social dance a few times a week could begin to \"rewire the neuropathways that have been impacted by cancer treatment,\" according to Worthen-Chaudhari.Preliminary data also shows that dancing the tango can lead to improvements in balance, cognitive function , motor function and neuropathy symptoms. ‘I’M A CANCER SURVIVOR – HERE'S WHAT I'VE CUT FROM MY KITCHEN' The rhythm of the Argentine tango, at 120 beats per minute, helps activate a \"neural phenomenon\" called \"entrainment,\" where \"two or more oscillating systems (like brainwaves or behaviors) align,\" the researchers noted.Given tango's ideal cadence, Worthen-Chaudhari told Fox News Digital that it \"made sense\" that doing the dance a couple of times per week would deliver positive effects of \"movement, rhythmic entrainment and social connection, all at once, in a way that promoted recovery more than any of those elements in isolation.\"Pilot data shows that this repetitive, slow music and walking dance help re-map nerves damaged by chemotherapy , she added.Other institutions have also reported success in balance and cognition after using adapted tango with Parkinson’s disease patients.This therapy could help individuals with other conditions, such as diabetes, dementia, neurodegenerative diseases and general aging, Worthen-Chaudhari noted. In addition to cancer patients, dancing the tango could also help individuals with other conditions and could relieve general aging effects, the researchers stated. (iStock) An expanded five-year study will continue to look into dual-task performance, with plans to recruit 140 breast cancer survivors at the OSU Cancer Center.The researchers will explore whether the effects of tango therapy can be sustained over time to improve movement and cognitive functions. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"In essence, this work is about helping survivors reclaim their lives and thrive, rather than just survive,\" Worthen-Chaudhari wrote in the release.\"It’s about providing them with a fun, effective way to improve their sensory motor skills and reduce the fear of falling, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being .\"Worthen-Chaudhari, shared that she was \"delighted\" to find that tango with a friend could work just as well as exercise to alleviate these symptoms.\"I wanted to know if tango could do more than prevent decline ... if it could stimulate neuro-recovery among those trying to recover from neuro-trauma,\" she told Fox News Digital. The rhythm of Argentine tango activates \"entrainment\" in the brain, the researchers said. (iStock) \"I'm excited about an option that doesn't require sweating, such that you have to shower before going back to work or out to dinner.\"\"In retrospect, I can see that it makes sense, but I was surprised that the results were clear even in an initial study of the idea,\" the scientist added. She assured, \"There is hope for recovery from the beating that cancer gives your body, brain and nerves.\"Aimee Kain, a breast cancer survivor and participant in the study, shared with Fox News Digital her \"amazing\" experience.\"It not only connected me with other women who are living with some of the same side effects as me, but it was also a fun, lighthearted way to approach treatment,\" she said. \"There are huge benefits to that.\"\"This research and study showed me that something I already enjoy can become a treatment.\"Kain reported that she's currently healthy and doing \"all the things I enjoy with minimal struggles\" while looking forward to the future. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"That's really all you can ask for,\" she said.The survivor encouraged others to give dance a try, even if it's \"a little outside your comfort zone.\"",

    "text": "Eric Kneedler, like any diehard Pittsburgh Steelers fan, spent part a recent weekend watching them battle through the bitter cold wind and heavy rain to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 17-10, securing a spot in the NFL playoffs. The weather in Rwanda’s capital city of Kigali was considerably more pleasant — about 77 degrees and sunny — at 6 a.m. Jan. 7 when Kneedler, the U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Rwanda, hopped on his treadmill and turned on a replay broadcast of the game. Kigali is seven hours ahead of Pittsburgh and Kneedler’s hometown of Lancaster, so getting up early after Steelers game days to work out and watch the replays has become a ritual since September, when Kneedler, 51, and his wife Kristin arrived in Kigali. (The couple’s two children remained in the U.S., where they attend boarding school.) Kneedler, who began his career in the Foreign Service in 1998, was nominated to be the ambassador to Rwanda by President Joe Biden in August 2022. He remained unconfirmed by Congress through 2022, but was renominated by the White House in January 2023 and ultimately confirmed in August. Kneedler said the delay in confirmation wasn’t unique to his nomination or the United States’ relationship with Rwanda. “I’m humbled by the chance to do this job and grateful for the confidence that was placed in me,” Kneedler said during a phone call from the base of Volcanoes National Park — the site of primatologist Dian Fossey’s famous study of mountain gorillas — in northwestern Rwanda. “I’m really enjoying it and feel very, very privileged.” As an ambassador, Kneedler serves at the discretion of the president, but typical assignments last about three years. An ambassador’s responsibilities include representing the country and its interests overseas, identifying economic opportunities and commercial ties, communicating messages between Washington, D.C., and the local government and, most importantly, taking care of American citizens abroad with issues ranging from lost passports or entanglements with local authorities. Kneedler’s lifelong passion for the Steelers is one way he stays connected to life in the U.S., and he’s kept up with his team all across the globe. (In a 1991 Lancaster New Era article about his plans to attend Pomona College in California, Kneedler was quoted saying, “We need more Pittsburgh fans on the West Coast.”) Before his role in Rwanda, he served as the interim ambassador, or Chargé d’Affaires, of Kenya at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi until August 2022. He has also held roles in Hong Kong; Manila, Philippines; Bangkok, Thailand; and Indonesia. Life in Lancaster Kneedler is the son of Richard and Suzette Kneedler. His father was an instructor of French at Franklin and Marshall College from 1968 to 1978 and became the president of the college from 1988 to 2002. His mother was a French teacher at Lancaster Country Day School, where Kneedler starred on the basketball, soccer and baseball teams and participated in student government and Model United Nations. He graduated from Lancaster Country Day School in 1991, earned a bachelor’s degree from Pomona College in Claremont, California, and a master’s from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. “I think (my parents) granted, both myself and my sister, a global perspective,” Kneedler said. “They were always very interested in international affairs. They were both French speakers, and I think that for sure had a role in my eventually becoming interested in living and working overseas.” Kneedler said his upbringing in Lancaster County was idyllic and can connect dots from his childhood to his work as an ambassador. “Lancaster is also a very patriotic place. Lancastrians have a strong desire to serve and to give back,” said Kneedler, who volunteered with community organizations such as the Mayor’s Youth Council and Toys for Tots as a teenager. “I’d like to think some of that rubbed off on me and helped contribute to my desire to find a way to serve. And Lancaster is a place where people work hard. There’s a really strong work ethic. I hope some of that rubbed off on me, as well.” Kneedler’s work ethic was evident in his high school years, according to his former soccer coach Dale Mylin. “Eric always worked hard in athletics. He was not naturally gifted. However, his excellent work ethic was a strong example to his teammates,” Mylin, 62, of Willow Street, wrote in an email. “Another valuable trait that Eric possessed was a sense of humor, not taking himself seriously, but taking his responsibilities seriously. When it came down to business, he was all in and expected his teammates to be, also.” Kneedler’s experience in Lancaster County may have shaped him as a person. And his parents may have provided him the tools for success and helped pique his interest in travel and language, but it was an experience — and not a good one — while studying abroad in Strasbourg, France, that Kneedler credits as being most influential to his career path. “Two very good friends of mine were attacked in a public square,” Kneedler said. “They were assaulted by a couple of guys who, unfortunately, were able to get away.” Kneedler’s friends immediately went to the local police, but the police dismissed their concerns and said they weren’t going to pursue the matter further. “What was really amazing to me about that incident was what (my friends) did next,” Kneedler said. “They went to our American consulate in Strasbourg and talked to the consul general at the time, and she immediately took it upon herself to press their case with the French police, which she did successfully.” The police eventually found the two people, and they were ultimately held accountable by the French judicial system and went to jail. “That was 100% because of this American diplomat who understood that the most important part of her job is taking care of American citizens,” Kneedler said. “And she did that. I was aware that the United States had embassies and there’s a profession called diplomacy, but I didn’t know a ton about it. I think that was probably the thing that sparked my interest in this.” This 1990 clipping from the Lancaster Intelligencer Journal features a story about the Lancaster Country Day boys' basketball team reaching championships and specifically mentions the achievements of Eric Kneedler, who then was a junior.

Eric Kneedler, ambassador to Rwanda, from the archives [photos] This 1990 clipping from the Lancaster Intelligencer Journal features a story about the Lancaster Country Day boys' basketball team reaching championships and specifically mentions the achievements of Eric Kneedler, who then was a junior. He is now the American ambassador to Rwanda. This 1991 clipping from the Lancaster Intelligencer Journal shows the seniors on the Lancaster Country Day boys' basketball championship team, including Eric Kneedler, who is now American ambassador to Rwanda. This 1990 clipping from the Lancaster New Era features a \"Teen of the Week\" story about Eric Kneedler, who attended Lancaster Country Day and is now U.S. ambassador to Rwanda. Sports and soft diplomacy Kneedler, who was one of three team captains on the 1990 boys basketball team that won the now defunct Susquehanna Independent Athletic Conference title, likes to joke that he was pretty close to playing in the NBA. “I think back to my second assignment, which was in Mauritius,” Kneedler said. “I had an opportunity to play some basketball there, and I ended up playing in what they call the MBA — the Mauritius Basketball Association. So, I tell my friends I was one letter away from making it.” For Kneedler, sports are among key components in making connections in foreign countries. In fact, Kneedler has already started playing pickup basketball games with a group of Rwandans and expats on the basketball court of Green Hills Academy in Kigali — whose head of school, Daniel Hollinger, is coincidentally a Lancaster native, as well. “I think what people sometimes refer to as soft diplomacy, whether that’s the arts, sports or sharing a good meal, that’s really where the rubber meets the road in terms of forging strong ties and meaningful relationships,” Kneedler said. “Personally, as somebody who really enjoys basketball, that’s something I’ve found to be very helpful in terms of getting to know a country.” Kneedler’s soft diplomacy skills, like his determination, persuasiveness and his ability to make and maintain meaningful relationships, have been a part of his personality since his days at Lancaster Country Day School. “The first word I think of when I think of Eric is ‘determination,’ ” wrote Bob Porter in an email. Porter is the boys varsity assistant basketball coach at Lancaster Country Day School and a former basketball teammate of Kneedler’s. “If he put his mind to getting something done, it was going to get done. When we were younger, that usually took the form of wrangling guys for pickup hoops somewhere — and often sneaking into F and M’s gym,” Porter said. “If Eric called you to get a game together, it was pretty pointless to refuse. He never took ‘no’ for an answer and was going to badger you until you laced them up and got on the court. At that point, he’d start raining (three-pointers) in your eye.” Jesse Fluck, of Lancaster, has been friends with Kneedler since kindergarten at Thomas Wharton Elementary School in the School District of Lancaster and then at Lancaster Country Day School, which Fluck attended until fifth grade. “I think one reason he’s such a good ambassador is he’s able to develop these friendships and keep them, and he’s trustworthy,” said Fluck, 50, who attended Kneedler’s swearing-in ceremony in Washington, D.C., before Kneedler departed for Rwanda. “What I thought was pretty special was the amount of friends that he’s accumulated over the years that attended the event.” Fluck, along with a small group of friends from Lancaster, went on a trip to climb Mount Kilimanjaro with Kneedler in 2022; he and his family flew to Nairobi to visit Kneedler when he was the interim ambassador there; and, Fluck noted, the person who Kneedler arranged to pick him and his family up from the airport was wearing a Steelers hat. Rwanda’s resilience Since arriving in Kigali, Kneedler has gained a new appreciation for Rwanda and the people who live there. He’s had the chance to learn about the Rwandan and American conservation efforts and explored the Volcanoes National Park. “It’s a really beautiful experience, especially trekking with gorillas,” Kneedler said. Part of an ambassador’s job is to help encourage American economic and philanthropic opportunities. Kneedler also pointed out the number of American universities, such as Carnegie Mellon University, who have established their first campus on the continent in Rwanda. He noted the American philanthropic work being done by comedian Ellen DeGeneres, who helped establish the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. And that the NBA hosts a continent-wide basketball tournament in various African cities, including Kigali. Kneedler said he thinks when most Americans think of Rwanda, they think of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi during the Rwandan Civil War. The United Nations estimates more than 1 million people were killed. “I think the most incredible thing about Rwanda is the resilience of the Rwandan people,” Kneedler said. “When you think back to that unimaginable tragedy and then you look now, 29 years later, you can’t help but be struck by the incredible resilience of the Rwandan people. To rise from the ashes of the genocide and become a destination country in many ways for tourism and for investment, it’s really quite striking.”",

    "text": "Global greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures are rising, causing more extreme and unpredictable weather and inflating costs for everything from food to health care. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry — largely responsible for the greatest crisis facing humanity — continues to rake in record profits.\nOil executives want to keep it that way.\nFor decades, industry has lied, misled and covered up evidence about the consequences of using its products as intended.\nAs far back as 1954, its own scientists accurately assessed the climate impacts of burning coal, oil and gas. Its response was to plough massive resources into campaigns to sow doubt and confusion regarding the clear evidence.\nAs the consequences scientists have predicted for decades become clear to everyone — droughts, floods, heat domes, wildfires, pollution-related health impacts, melting glaciers and polar ice caps, water shortages, species extinctions, growing numbers of desperate people fleeing inhospitable areas and more — Big Oil has had to concoct new strategies to keep the world hooked on its products.\nOne of the more egregious is promoting gas as a “climate solution.” You may have seen the ubiquitous\nads and “sponsored content” from companies such as Fortis touting “clean LNG” and “ renewable natural gas.” For many years, industry has argued that methane gas, which it misleadingly refers to as “natural gas” or “liquefied natural gas,” can be a “bridge” or “transition” fuel to help the world move away from coal and oil, which produce more carbon dioxide emissions when burned.\nThe companies and their front groups omit some important details. Methane, the main constituent of “natural” gas, is a\nfar more potent heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide over the short term. Although it has a relatively short lifespan compared to CO2, it can trap as much as 80 times more heat over a couple of decades. Methane concentrations have more than doubled over the past 200 years and are responsible for an estimated 30 per cent of global heating.\nAlthough some methane comes from natural sources, most is from human activities, including agriculture, fossil fuels and decomposing landfill waste. With fossil fuel operations, methane is emitted into the atmosphere throughout its life cycle, much of it through intentional and unintentional leaks or flaring (burning off excess gas).\nThe\nInternational Energy Agency warns that if fossil fuel companies don’t reduce these emissions, it will be impossible to meet global climate targets. Of course, quickly shifting away from fossil fuels altogether would be the best way to resolve the problem.\nIndustry also fails to note that renewable energy is now a far more cost-effective, much cleaner way to produce energy. Substituting natural gas for coal will only slow the necessary transition to renewables.\nResearch also shows that methane emissions have historically been underestimated, as have their health impacts. Recent studies show that\nliving near flaring and fracking sites is associated with premature births and low birth weight, which “causes higher infant mortality and more chronic illness later in life and is associated with poor lung function,” according to toxicology and public health expert Tim Takaro, professor emeritus in Simon Fraser University’s faculty of health sciences and a member of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.\nIt’s far easier to monopolize and concentrate massive profits from fossil fuels than renewable energy, so many oil companies have been reducing their already limited spending on renewable alternatives.\n“At the end of the day, we’re a molecule company, not an electron company,”\nExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods recently said. In a Fortune interview, Woods also said of the energy transition, “The dirty secret nobody talks about is how much all this is going to cost and who’s willing to pay for it.” Exxon raked in US$36 billion profits in 2023 and Woods himself made over US$35 million.\nIndustry has also been\npaying to co-opt some First Nations leaders in its efforts to create division and expand gas fracking, production and export in Canada and to oppose necessary climate measures.\nAre there no limits to Big Oil’s greedy efforts to keep the money rolling in while everyone suffers from climate change impacts and rising costs of living fuelled by volatile oil and gas markets? For the sake of people and the planet, it has to stop!\nDavid Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster, author and co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation.

    "text": "Neste primeiro fim de semana de novembro, feriado do Dia de Finados, o céu deve ficar encoberto na Região Metropolitana [Curitiba](https://www.bemparana.com.br/noticias/parana/inicio-de-novembro-esta-com-previsao-de-muitas-nuvens/) e há previsão de chuva. Já que muitas pessoas viajam de carro pelas rodovias, é necessário redobrar a atenção. De acordo com o Sistema Meteorológico do Paraná (Simepar), a instabilidade aumenta de forma significativa sobre as regiões do estado, devido à incursão de uma massa de ar úmida no Sul do Brasil. Entre o Noroeste e o Oeste do estado, pode chover em vários momentos deste sábado (2). No Norte e Centro-Sul do Paraná, o tempo deve ficar mais instável à tarde. Há risco de tempestades localizadas e rajadas de ventos. Segurança nas rodovias Viajar com o céu nublado pode apresentar alguns desafios. O principal impacto está na visibilidade, que pode ser reduzida dependendo da intensidade das nuvens e da presença de neblina. O céu encoberto pode ser um indicativo de condições meteorológicas variáveis, como chuvas ou garoas, o que exige mais atenção dos motoristas. Veja dicas para garantir a segurança nas estradas no retorno do Feriado - Ultrapasse outros veículos somente em locais permitidos e com condições adequadas para a manobra: As ultrapassagens em locais proibidos representam um dos maiores riscos de acidentes graves. Respeite as sinalizações e só realize a manobra quando tiver total segurança. - Respeite a sinalização de trânsito: As placas e indicações são fundamentais para orientar os motoristas e garantir um tráfego seguro. Siga as orientações de velocidade, curvas perigosas e áreas de risco. - Descanse antes de iniciar a viagem: A fadiga é um inimigo perigoso na estrada. Certifique-se de estar bem descansado antes de iniciar seu trajeto para manter a atenção plena enquanto dirige. - Não beba antes de dirigir: A combinação de álcool e direção é extremamente perigosa e ilegal. Se for beber, não dirija. A PRF realizará testes de bafômetro durante a operação. - Respeite os limites de velocidade: A velocidade excessiva aumenta a gravidade dos acidentes. Siga os limites estabelecidos para cada trecho da rodovia. - Confira as condições do veículo antes da viagem: Verifique itens como freios, pneus, faróis e níveis de óleo e água. Manter o veículo em boas condições é essencial para evitar imprevistos e acidentes. - Verifique as condições meteorológicas no trajeto: Informar-se sobre o clima pode evitar surpresas como chuvas intensas ou neblina densa. Adapte sua condução às condições do tempo para maior segurança.",
