    "title": "Police urge bike riders to sign up to Bike Register Database to help recover lost or stolen bicycles",
    "text": "Police are calling on all bike riders to make use of a new app that aims to recover their cycles if they are stolen. The force are urging cyclists to sign up to the Bike Register Database, which already contains the details of tens of thousands of bicycles across the UK. The bank of information, used by Police Scotland for the last year, is also condensed into a downloadable app which owners are being urged to use to register their bike if it is lost or stolen. Police say there have been four incidents recently that have resulted in bikes being returned to their owners thanks to the app, with one cyclist in Edinburgh reunited with their bicycle after moving to Woking. A member of the public discovered the bike and with the phone app’s functions, was able to help the owner trace its location as it had been registered as lost. Police in the Wester Hailes area of Edinburgh say in the last two months they stepped in to return two bikes to owners through the app after they had been handed in to a police station with both being registered on the database as stolen. The app allows users to scan a barcode or enter property details to find out the status of the bike, whether it is lost or stolen and details about the owner. The force say with a number of new bikes likely purchased as Christmas gifts, riders should take advantage of the new features to log their details. Inspector Jordan Low from Police Scotland’s Rural and Acquisitive Crime Team, said: “We know that for many in Scotland, bikes are not just an important recreational item, they are a vital mode of transportation or exercise and to have them lost or stolen can be devastating. “I would ask that all bike owners ensure their bicycles’ details are logged on the Bike Register database, as this will aid us during our inquiries whenever we locate any bikes that we believe to be stolen, or that are brought into police stations as lost property. “The recent successful recoveries highlight just how important the database is in order to reunite bikes with their rightful owners and the app available to officers on their mobile device is another useful tool in helping us tackle bike theft across the country.” STV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country [Follow STV News](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaCESJzKgsNvKKNOYO2r) Follow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

    "text": "Ecco quanto guadagna Paolo Bonolis: è uno dei conduttori più amati della televisione italiana e i suoi programmi sono spesso un successo. Uno dei conduttori televisivi più amati dal pubblico è, senza ombra di dubbio, Paolo Bonolis . I suoi programmi, sia quelli sui canali Mediaset che quelli sulla Rai, si sono quasi sempre rivelati dei grandi successi, questo anche per la capacità del conduttore di attirare il pubblico grazie alla propria simpatia. Dopo gli esordi a Bim Bum Bam lo abbiamo visto a Tira & Molla, Striscia la notizia, Affari Tuoi, Domenica In, Ciao Darwin e molti altri. Certo, va detto, il suo stile di conduzione non piace a tutti e negli anni è stato al centro di diverse polemiche, anche per i suoi cachet. Ma quanto guadagna Paolo Bonolis? Vediamolo insieme.\nQuanto guadagna Paolo Bonolis Le ultime notizie certe riguardo gli stipendi percepiti da Paolo Bonolis risalgono al 2019, quando ha rinnovato il contratto con Mediaset : il conduttore guadagna circa 10 milioni di euro all’anno . Ricordiamo che Paolo Bonolis lo possiamo vedere alla guida del quiz show Avanti un altro (che conduce dal 2011).\nPaolo Bonolis Lo stipendio percepito da Paolo Bonolis è certamente aumentando nel corso degli anni, basti pensare che nel 2005, quando tornò sui canali Mediaset dopo gli anni alla Rai, firmò un contratto che prevedeva uno stipendio da 8,5 milioni di euro all’anno. Non che il suo precedente contratto con Mediaset, risalente al 1998, fosse molto diverso: all’epoca il suo compenso era di 18 miliardi di lire , diventati poi 12 miliardi nel 2001.\nCerto Paolo Bonolis è uno dei presentatori più pagati del panorama televisivo italiano ma, allo stesso tempo (come abbiamo detto anche in precedenza) è anche uno dei più apprezzati e i suoi programmi fanno sempre registrare ottimi dati di ascolto, che generano grandi introiti pubblicitari.",
