    "text": "Kolkata: Flight operations to and fro Kazi Nazrul Islam (KNI) airport were temporarily suspended on Friday due to water logging problem in and around the airport premises caused due to incessant rainfall overnight, officials said.\nAround three flights to and fro the airport, including one from New Delhi and another from Bengaluru, had to be cancelled for the day, an official said, adding that this region recorded 192 mm rainfall which caused the problem.\nThe passengers were informed about the problem with ample time in hand to minimize the inconvenience caused to them, the authorities of KNI airport said.\nOn Friday, the first flight was supposed to land at KNI airport at 12.50 pm and therefore the passengers could be informed, they said.\nWater gushed into the airport premises and caused water logging in the operational area. Similarly, several places at the approach road to the airport from the highway got inundated also, officials said.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 02 August 2024, 13:58 IST",
