    "title": "Your SoCal Weather Report For Friday, Aug. 2: Get ready for excessive heat this weekend",
    "text": "By Gillian Morán Pérez ,\n1 hour ago\nStay cool and stay hydrated -- it's going to get really hot this weekend. (Courtesy NWS) We made it to Friday people! In the forecast today — high temps and sunny skies. But this weekend, the heat will ramp up.\nForecasters say there's still a chance of thunderstorms this afternoon for the mountains, especially over the eastern San Gabriel Mountains and eastern Antelope Valley. That's prompted a red flag warning — keep reading to learn why.\nDaytime highs for the beaches will be in the 70s with partly cloudy skies this afternoon and in the upper 80s to low 90s for the inland coast. Expect a high of 91 degrees today in Anaheim.\nInland areas including valleys will see highs between 93 to 102 degrees. In the low desert expect a high of 112 degrees and up to 102 degrees in the high desert.\nAbout those advisories\nExcessive heat\nWe're looking at excessive heat this weekend for most of the Southland. Starting tomorrow, residents in the Inland Empire, deserts and Santa Ana foothills will experience high temperatures in the upper 90s, up to 108 degrees for Riverside and San Bernardino and up to 118 degrees for the low desert. Come Sunday morning, temperatures will rise for the L.A. and Ventura county mountains and valleys where daytime highs will reach up to 103 degrees.\nRed flag warning\nForecasters have issued a red flag warning for the mountains and deserts in L.A. and Ventura counties due to a small threat of thunderstorms, strong winds and chance of lightning. All of those conditions increases the risk of igniting new wildfires or spreading any ongoing fires. The warning is scheduled to end tonight at 8 p.m.\nOdor advisory\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District reports that residents in eastern Coachella Valley will experience a rotten egg like odor for the next few days due to elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide. Officials say the gas smells like rotten eggs but is a natural process out of the Salton Sea. Officials say southeast winds will increase the smell during daytime hours, especially for cities north of the Salton Sea like Mecca and Indio. The odor should die down by Tuesday.\nThis day in history On this day in 1873, inventor Andrew S. Hallidie successfully tested the first cable car for San Francisco.\nThings to do It's Food Friday!:\nMy colleagues Yusra Farzan and Gab Chabran take a tasting tour through Little Arabia in Anaheim. From shawarma to mandi to manoushe — Little Arabia has more than enough to take your tastebuds on a delightful journey. An Evening With John Legend: Could the smooth sounds of piano wizard and writer of everyone’s wedding song. John Legend at the Greek be anything other than…legendary? Snuggle up under the stars for a summertime date night. The OC Fair is underway and if you're looking for another reason to go this weekend (other than deep fried Oreos and funnel cake), my colleague Jill Replogle reports that customers can take a virtual plunge through one of SoCal's offshore oil platform. Check out our full list of things to do this weekend.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Russell Westbrook Made NBA History in Nuggets-Suns Christmas Game\nThe Denver Nuggets fell to the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night by a final score of 110-100. This game wrapped up the NBA’s Christmas Day slate that included several exciting matchups.\nFollowing a classic between the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors that featured big time performances from LeBron James and Steph Curry, this Nuggets-Suns contest also saw NBA legends have big games.\nScoring 27 points in the winning effort, Suns forward Kevin Durant matched his star teammate Bradley Beal for the game-high in scoring. On Denver’s side, it was Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook who helped lead the charge.\nFinishing with 17 points and six rebounds off the bench, Westbrook complemented the 25 points and 15 rebounds Jokic turned in. Climbing up the Christmas Day ranks, Westbrook also made NBA history in this game.\nVia NBA: “Congrats to @KingJames of the @Lakers for becoming the first player ever to 500 PTS on Christmas Day, and to @russwest44 of the @nuggets for moving up to 6th all-time in PTS on Christmas Day!”\nNow 6th all-time in points on Christmas, Westbrook passed his former teammate James Harden on this exclusive list. Building a strong Sixth Man of the Year case, Westbrook is averaging 12.1 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.1 rebounds in just 25.9 minutes per game.\nWestbrook and the Nuggets will play again on Friday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nRelated Articles\n[Nikola Jokic Makes NBA History in Nuggets-Mavericks](https://www.si.com/nba/nuggets/news/nikola-jokic-makes-nba-history-in-nuggets-mavericks-01jccm0898nc)\n[Nikola Jokic Makes Strong Russell Westbrook Statement](https://www.si.com/nba/nuggets/news/nikola-jokic-makes-strong-russell-westbrook-statement-01jc6s226ck7)\n[Latest Update on Denver Nuggets Potentially Signing Ex-Lakers Player](https://www.si.com/nba/nuggets/news/latest-update-on-denver-nuggets-potentially-signing-ex-lakers-player-01jc1jjfn8kc)",

    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — Rev up the Zamboni, the NHL is officially coming to Salt Lake City! The NHL's Board of Governors approved the relocation of the Arizona Coyotes to northern Utah Thursday, with the team set to take the ice next season. The move was the final step in a process that began making headlines last week. [WATCH: Will Utahns love the NHL like they love the Jazz?](https://www.fox13now.com/sports/nhl/would-utahns-love-the-nhl-like-they-love-the-jazz) Team owner Ryan Smith used just 7 words to welcome the NHL to Utah, posting, \"The NHL is here!

While expected, [especially after the league's executive committee approved the move Tuesday](https://www.fox13now.com/sports/nhl-in-slc/nhl-executive-committee-approves-arizona-coyotes-move-to-utah-report-says), the stamp of approval by NHL owners opens a new era for hockey in the Beehive State as Utah welcomes another professional sports franchise. “As everyone knows, Utah is a vibrant and thriving state, and we are thrilled to be a part of it,” said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.

In a post to X, the Jazz welcomed their arena siblings, as did Big Utah League, the organization looking to bring a Major League Baseball to the Power District. The NHL released a hype video below after the Utah announcement: The Smith's will officially welcome Bettman and the league to Utah during a press conference Friday at the arena. As with most Utahns, Gov. Spencer Cox was enthusiastic about the announcement bringing the highest level of pro hockey to the state. “Utah is once again at the center of the sports world as we welcome the NHL to Utah,\" he said in a statement. \"Thanks to Ryan and Ashley Smith, Salt Lake City just keeps getting better and better. The whole state will benefit from this new franchise and we couldn’t be more excited by this announcement.” [WATCH: Golden Eagles dropped puck on Utah's ice hockey passion](https://www.fox13now.com/sports/nhl-in-slc/golden-eagles-dropped-puck-on-utahs-ice-hockey-passion) The governor's excitement was echoed by other local leaders. “This announcement is about more than bringing an NHL team to Salt Lake City — it’s a defining moment in our trajectory, becoming a catalyst for a positive vision that integrates community, connection, and more possibilities for families, residents, and visitors to experience our capital city,\" said Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. The Coyotes brand will remain with now-former Arizona owner Alex Meruelo, with the Utah team set for a complete rebrand encompassing a nickname and franchise colors.",

    "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. — Un niño fue encontrado inconsciente dentro de una bañera el jueves por la tarde en Glendale, según el Departamento de Policía de Glendale.\nLos oficiales respondieron a llamadas de emergencia a una casa cerca de la avenida 59 y Bethany Home Road alrededor de las 2 p.m. y encontraron al menor inconsciente. El niño fue trasladado de inmediato a un hospital y se encontraba en grave donde se encuentra recibiendo tratamiento, informaron las autoridades.\nLa madre les dijo a los oficiales que salió un rato y que encontró al niño en la bañera antes de llamar al 911.\nRELACIONADO: Estadísticas sobre la seguridad en el agua en Arizona\nConsejos para la prevención de ahogamiento: El ahogamiento es la principal causa de muerte en niños de entre 1 y 4 años, además de los defectos de nacimiento, según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades. Tres niños mueren cada día por ahogamiento. Aquí hay algunos consejos de los CDC sobre cómo proteger a los niños cerca del agua:\nAprenda habilidades para salvar vidas\nTodo el mundo debería conocer los conceptos básicos de la natación (flotar, moverse en el agua) y la RCP.\nCerrar áreas\nInstale una cerca de aislamiento de cuatro lados, con puertas de cierre y pestillo automáticos, alrededor de las piscinas del patio trasero. Esto puede ayudar a mantener a los niños alejados del área cuando se supone que no deben nadar. Las cercas de la piscina deben separar completamente la casa y el área de juegos de la piscina.\nLos chalecos salvavidas son importantes\nAsegúrese de que los niños usen chalecos salvavidas dentro y alrededor de cuerpos de agua naturales, como lagos o el océano, incluso si saben nadar. Los chalecos salvavidas también se pueden utilizar dentro y alrededor de las piscinas para los nadadores más débiles.\nMantenga una estrecha vigilancia\nCuando los niños estén dentro o cerca del agua (incluidas las bañeras), supervíselos de cerca en todo momento. Debido a que el ahogamiento ocurre de manera rápida y silenciosa, los adultos que cuidan a niños dentro o cerca del agua deben evitar actividades que los distraigan, como leer libros, hablar por teléfono o consumir alcohol y drogas.\nPara más contenido en español, visite 12News.com/espanol\nSíganos en nuestra página de Facebook 12News en Español\nVisite nuestra sección de 12News en Español en YouTube\nDescargue la aplicación 12 News KPNX para recibir notificaciones en español:\niPhone: http://12ne.ws/iphone\nAndroid: http://12ne.ws/android\nClose Ad",
