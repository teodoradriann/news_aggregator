    "text": "Preview Mode\n[Edit & Post]\nLimited Edition 2025 Ducati Panigale V4 S Tricolore Italia Gallery\nDucati unveiled a new limited edition Panigale V4 Tricolore Italia, featuring a replica of the livery the Ducati Lenovo MotoGP team raced with at Mugello in 2024, with Francesco Bagnaia taking the win and teammate Enea Bastianini finishing second. The Azzurro livery is in tribute of the colors of Italy's national sports teams.\nOnly 163 units will be built, representing first place and Bagnaia's traditional number 63. Each bike comes with a certificate of authenticity, a dedicated motorcycle cover, and a numbered badge. Prospective buyers will also have access to purchase a limited edition riding suit with matching colors.\nDucati hasn't released a price, though that matters little as all 163 bikes have already been reserved.\nPhotos by Ducati.\nBy Dennis Chung",

    "text": "Since May 6th, 2025, there has been an active prescribed burn in Dog Valley.\nWith all the smoke noticeable in the air, the public is asked not to call 911 because of it, as these prescribed burns are being monitored and will be seen throughout the week.\nEven though the smoke may be inconvenient, it has a purpose.\nAccording to the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest U.S. Department of Agriculture, prescribed fire is a critical tool to reduce the threat of high-severity wildfires, prevent insect and disease outbreaks, recycle nutrients that increase soil productivity, and improve wildlife habitat.\nFor this burn, weather permitting, fire crews plan on burning around 657 acres.\nAngela Schilling, one of our meteorologists here at 2 News Nevada, told us more about how the smoke may react in the coming days.\n\"The main thing is at night we don't get a lot of wind, and so during the day usually our winds pick up, and that can kind of mix everything around, but at night when you don't have a lot of wind, basically what happens is all the smoke and everything can settle at the bottom, kind of like if you think about if you have a glass and have something heavier like dirt, then you have water above. Basically during the day if you have wind, you mix it up and everything, but during the night it just sits at the bottom, so that's what's been happening.\"\nShe also mentions, \"During the day, even just with the sun coming up and it heats the surface, what happens with that is it can also break apart inversion as well; it's usually with wind, and an inversion is basically like a cap, so it's a lid, and that smoke and the haze sit there at night, but if you have wind or daytime heating and everything, it can break it apart.\"\nAs for the health of the community and people being affected by the smoke, everyone can be affected, but specifically those who are in sensitive groups, including all children, people with heart and lung disease, and very active adults, can be affected, especially if you're outside.\nBrendan Schnieder, a senior air quality specialist, tells us, \"Especially those that have asthma, heart conditions can be more affected by smoky conditions.\"\nBut he explains that there are things you can do to help stay out of the smoke.\n\"We always ask residents whenever it's smoky outside to be smoke smart, stay indoors if you can reduce activity, and make sure you're paying attention to airnow.gov. We send out air data there every hour of every day.\"\nAirNow also has fire and smoke maps, and if you want to check out the air quality, click here.\nSchnieder also tells us more about prescribed burns: \"Prescribed burns are meant to help make our forests healthier; they are sort of a short-time nuisance—they can cause air quality concerns temporarily, but they're designed to prevent severe wildfires that can impact us throughout the entire summer.\"",

    "title": "Board Game Memories",
    "text": "Board games have always been part of my life, since the time I was a youngster and all through my adult years.\nI am very fond of word games – Scrabble, along with its offshoots like Boggle and Bananagrams, have always been family favorites. My new go-to game is called A Genius Square, a fast-paced puzzle game designed for one or two players. It challenges players to fill a 6×6 grid using various shapes, thus testing one’s spatial skills. What’s great about it is that you can play against yourself or against another person. If you like Tetris, you’ll love this game.\nOccasionally, I will take out an old classic like Mastermind, which still holds up as a great game to play (we need more of those black and white pegs for the game, though, which seem to have disappeared from many years of use).\nWe are big fans of Rummikub, and when we entertain sleepover guests, we’ll often take out the Rummikub set on Friday night and play. (You can’t play this game with only two people; it’s best with four or five players.) Our daughter Tova, of blessed memory, loved playing this game, and she was quite skilled at it. (For the life of me, I cannot figure how comfortable she was understanding the number configurations in this game, considering that n she struggled mightily in school with math. It’s fascinating how the brain works.)\nHowever, I’d like to reminisce about three classic board games in more detail, two from my youth and one from adulthood.\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who remembers playing Monopoly as a child. This popular board game, which was first introduced in 1935 by Parker Brothers, was a staple in our home. We usually played the game as a family on Friday night during the winter, when Shabbat started early and we could spend a couple of hours after dinner competing in the game.\nMy father was usually the banker (my mother was not a game player), and I played with my three siblings. As I recall, my brother always demanded to use the racing car as his game piece; for some strange reason, I always preferred the shoe (don’t ask me why).\nAs for strategy, I always loved the orange spaces—St. James Place, New York Avenue and Tennessee Avenue—and I would do everything I could to obtain these properties. I thought that there would be a greater chance for people to land on these properties because over the course of a game, players often spent time in jail – and the orange properties were six to nine spaces away from the jail, ripe for landing once someone got out of jail.\nI also thought the railroads were a good buy, and I always tried to accumulate as many of the four railroad properties as I could.\nAs I recall, my brother Eric seemed to win the game an inordinate number of the times we played, perhaps a foretelling of his eventual success in the world of finance.\nMy wife and I also played the game with our kids, but for some reason they didn’t take to the game like we did as youngsters. I’m not even sure if we still have the game in our possession anymore.\nOf course, there was also the game of Risk, manufactured by Parker Brothers and first introduced in 1959. Who can forget those long summer Shabbat afternoons, when three- or four-hour Risk games with friends in the neighborhood was not uncommon. The game always took interesting twists and turns and never seemed to end, until someone finally was able to take control and conquer the world.\nI always liked to start accumulating armies in South America, which was relatively easy to defend, and I would expand from there. That was a good strategy sometimes, but others who preferred to load up in Africa or even Australia sometimes were successful, too. I always stacked my troops on choke points, where opponents were likely to attack. And I always tried to expand strategically, never spreading myself too thin and carefully taking calculated risks where appropriate. Timing is everything in the game of Risk, and I would usually wait until the middle or end of the game to make big moves for global domination.\nI clearly remember the unusual geographic map of the world on the Risk board game. Kamchatka was a very important part of the Risk game, but I have never seen an area called by that name on any other map or in any geography class! I also got a kick out of how big Afghanistan was on the Risk map; while Afghanistan is not a small country, it is certainly nowhere near as big as China or India (yet it is shown to be much larger on the Risk map of the world). And Vladimir Putin should only know how big Ukraine is on the Risk map – bigger in area than all of Europe!\nFinally, there is the game of Trivial Pursuit. This game remains one of the best-selling board games of all time, with more than 100 million copies sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. It has become an iconic part of trivia culture, continuing to challenge and entertain generations of new players.\nI clearly remember the beginning days of this game in the early 1980s. My wife and I were newly married, and when the game was first introduced, we bought a set and often invited other couples to come over on Saturday night to play. The idea of a trivia game was something very innovative at the time and the popularity of the game was fueled by the growing popularity of trivia-based entertainment and game shows at the time.\nThe game features six categories of trivia questions: geography, entertainment, history, arts and literature, science and nature, and sports and leisure. Players move around the board, answering questions to earn colored wedges, with the goal of filling their “pie” with all six wedges and answering a final question correctly.\nThere are 6,000 total trivia questions. Each card in the game has one question for each of the six categories, and the game includes a large deck of question cards to ensure plenty of variety during gameplay. At this point, I guess there are some folks who have gone through all the questions and know all the answers, but back in the 1980s when the game first was launched, there were enough questions to make sure that the game was played fairly.\nIt was quite a phenomenon in the early 1980s, but like anything else, some other games eventually struck the fancy of game players and replaced Trivial Pursuit in popularity. However, this game will always have a warm place in my heart.\nWhat are your favorite board games?",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
