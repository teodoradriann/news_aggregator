    "text": "A Tasmanian senator has taken aim at the state's main tourism promotion agency and regional tourism boards, claiming that failure to adequately promote local businesses, events and destinations is contributing to the industry's stress.\\u003cbr\\u003eSenator Tammy Tyrrell made the comments after seeing Tasmanian Hospitality Association statistics that revealed June occupancy rates for North-West Coast hotels at just 38 per cent.\\u003cbr\\u003eTHA chief executive Steve Old said recently June occupancy rates in the state - 56.75 per cent - were the lowest since 2018 when excluding the COVID period, and were approaching the lowest levels seen in a decade.\\u003cbr\\u003eHe blamed the low numbers on the decision to scale back Tasmania's key winter festival, Dark Mofo, as well as ongoing concerns around cost of living.Senator Tyrrell criticised Tourism Tasmania, claiming the agency failed to sufficiently promote events in regional Tasmania.\\u003cbr\\u003eDuring a recent trip to the West Coast, several businesses told her that while Tourism Tasmania representatives met with them, they provided no effective support, Senator Tyrrell said.\\u003cbr\\u003eA spokesperson for Tourism Tasmania said this year was the state's largest investment in a winter marketing campaign.The spokesperson said the agency's Odd Jobs campaign, which promoted unique Tasmanian unpaid jobs such as 'Wombat Walkers' and 'Wine Whisperers', reached a global audience of more than 1.3 billion.Senator Tyrrell said an example from another area was Latrobe's Chocolate Winterfest, which drew 6000 visitors on Sunday, according to event organisers.\\u003cbr\\u003eLatrobe Mayor Peter Freshney agreed more promotion of events like Chocolate Winterfest was needed.West By Northwest did not respond to a request for comment.\\u003cbr\\u003eTourism Tasmania pointed out that Chocolate Winterfest was featured in The Hobart Magazine, as well as in the agency's e-newsletters, as well as on its website and app.Mayor Freshney also said Tourism Tasmania was too focussed on getting interstate visitors to fly to either Hobart or Launceston airports.According to Tourism Tasmania figures, 63 per cent of visitors fly out of Hobart airport, and 22 per cent fly out of Launceston airport.Senator Tyrrell said high airfares were another negative factor.Senator Tyrrell also took a swipe at the representatives of regional tourism boards such as Visit Northern Tasmania and West By Northwest.",

Les syndicats demandent également le \"maintien d'un ministère de plein exercice pour la fonction publique\" dans le futur gouvernement, plutôt qu'un simple ministère délégué ou secrétariat d'Etat. Il s'agit pour eux d'une condition \"indispensable\" mais pas \"suffisante\" à \"un dialogue social de qualité afin de répondre aux enjeux des services publics [du] pays et aux attentes des 5,5 millions d'agents publics\". Nommé Premier ministre le 5 septembre, Michel Barnier s'est engagé à ce que son gouvernement soit formé d'ici à la semaine prochaine.

    "text": "NVIDIA's keynote at CES 2025 introduced the world to the what is now considered to be the most powerful graphics card in the world, the GeForce RTX 5090.\nDuring the presentation NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang detailed the massive performance increase of the RTX 5090 versus its predecessor, and how AI is responsible for big performance jumps in games. The technology Huang was referring to is DLSS, and with the new RTX 50 series cards buyers will get DLSS 4, which is set to offer massive performance increases in compatible games. NVIDIA has begun releasing performance comparisons between games running without DLSS 4, and then with DLSS 4 turned on.\nOne of those titles is the upcoming Dune: Awakening, which NVIDIA showcases running at approximately 60FPS on the RTX 5090 without DLSS 4 turned on. The next section of the video shows Dune: Awakening achieving a staggering 240FPS, with it pushing above 300+FPS in some scenes thanks to DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation.\nWhile the insane jump in frame rate is certainly impressive, it simultaneously highlights either the poor optimization of the current level of development for Dune: Awakening, as the title can only achieve just above 60FPS on the RTX 5090, or the underwhelming performance of the RTX 5090 running games natively.",

    "text": "Sadly, 2023 has been a violent year on the global stage. War broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis, including many children, on both sides. And the bitter war between Russia and Ukraine continued with no end in sight.\nAs a result of the focus on these two conflicts, other countries have fallen off the radar for many people. However, some of these countries are dealing with growing unrest, which could erupt in 2024 and make global headlines.\nSo, where should we look in the coming year? Here are five places where I believe civil conflict or unrest could get worse and potentially lead to violence.\nmyanmar\nMyanmar descended into a state of chaos in 2021 when a military coup overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and triggered widespread civilian protests that eventually turned into armed resistance.\nHome to 135 ethnic groups there has rarely been peace in this country. For years before the coup, there was an ongoing low-grade civil conflict between the military and several minority ethnic groups who had long sought independence from the state and control of natural resources in their areas.\nThe explosion came after the coup as ethnic militia groups opposing the junta joined forces with pro-democracy fighters from the Bamar majority.\nTheir resistance increased with a coordinated northern offensive in late 2023, causing the army's largest losses in many years.\nThe rebels gained control of towns and villages along the northeastern border with China, including control of key trade routes. This led to renewed fighting in western Rakhine state as well as other areas.\nThe tenacity of resistance from these minority groups, combined with the military's refusal to compromise, suggests that the country's civil war could worsen significantly in 2024 and regain international attention.\ngardener\nIn Mali, a country in Africa's restive Sahel region, tensions have been rising throughout 2023 and are now at risk of breaking out into full-scale civil war.\nMali has been struggling with rebel activities for a long time. In 2012, Mali's government fell in a coup and Tuareg rebels, backed by Islamic militants, seized power in the north.\nThe United Nations peacekeeping mission was established in 2013 to bring stability to Mali. Then, in 2015, major rebel groups signed a peace agreement with the government of Mali.\nRead more: Mali crisis: UN peacekeepers leaving after 10 years – what is needed for a smooth transition\nFollowing two more coups in 2020 and 2021, military authorities consolidated their power and said they would restore the state's full territorial control over all of Mali. The regime insisted on withdrawing the UN peacekeeping mission from the country, which it did in June 2023. Subsequently, violence broke out between the army and rebel forces over the future use of UN bases.\nIn November, forces reportedly backed by Russia's Wagner Group took control of the strategic northern town of Kidal, which had been held by Tuareg forces since 2012. This undermines the fragile peace that has been in place since 2015.\nIt is unlikely that the army will regain full control of all rebel-held areas in the north. Also, the morale of the militants is high. With the 2015 peace agreement now almost over, we can expect increased instability in 2024.\nlebanon\nIn 2019, widespread civil protests broke out in Lebanon against leaders who were believed to be not addressing the day-to-day needs of the population.\nThe situation continued to deteriorate with government changes, a growing economic crisis, and a massive port explosion that exposed corrupt practices.\nProtests outside a bank in Lebanon after the lira hit an all-time low against the US dollar in March 2023. Wael Hamzeh/EPA\nThe International Monetary Fund criticized Lebanon in September for a lack of economic reform. The Lebanese government has also failed to agree on the appointment of a president, a position that has been vacant for more than a year.\nThis threatens to undermine the fragile power-sharing arrangement in Lebanon, in which the key political posts of prime minister, speaker and president are allocated to Sunni-Muslims, Shia-Muslims and Christian Maronites respectively.\nRecently, the war between Israel and Hamas has threatened to spread to Lebanon, home to the Hezbollah terrorist group, which claims to have an army of 100,000 fighters. Crucially, this jeopardizes tourism as Lebanon's main hope for economic recovery.\nThese factors could lead to a more serious economic and political collapse in 2024.\nPakistan\nSince Pakistan's independence in 1947, the military has played an interventionist role in politics. Although Pakistani leaders are popularly elected, military authorities have at times removed them from power.\nIn 2022, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan became disillusioned with the militant leaders of Pakistan. He was later ousted from power in a parliamentary vote and later arrested on charges that his supporters claim are politically motivated.\nHis arrest sparked violent demonstrations across the country – a display of anger against the military that was once unimaginable.\nPakistan also faces instability and increasing terrorist attacks in neighboring Afghanistan. These security challenges are further compounded by the struggling economy and the ongoing costs of devastating floods in 2022.\nPakistan is expected to hold parliamentary elections in February 2024, after which the current military caretaker government is expected to transfer power to civilian rule. Many people are keeping a close eye on the army. If this transfer of power does not occur, or is delayed, civil unrest may occur.\nRead more: How Imran Khan's populism has divided Pakistan and left it on a knife's edge\nSri Lanka\nSri Lanka faced a debilitating economic crisis in 2022 leading to severe shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Due to civil protests, then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had to flee the country. He was replaced by current President Ranil Vikram Singh.\nStability returned in 2023 as Sri Lanka began implementing economic reforms as part of a bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. However, widespread dissatisfaction with the political elite and the underlying drivers of the country's economic difficulty have not been addressed.\nSoldiers blocked the road as workers protest against the government's domestic debt restructuring process and new labor laws proposed in July 2023. Chamila Karunaratne/EPA\nElections are also to be held in Sri Lanka by the end of 2024. While incumbent Vikramsingh is likely to run for a second term, his confidence among the public is low. He is seen as very close to the corrupt political elite.\nThis discontent could lead to renewed protests – especially if the economy falters again – a repeat of the same situation that led to Rajapaksa's ouster in 2022.\nSource: theconversation.com",

While introduced as a high-ranking member of the Night Action program, responsible for training and overseeing agents, Catherine fails to leave a lasting impression.\nMany viewers feel that her role lacks depth and intensity, especially compared to the more compelling arcs of other supporting characters from previous seasons. Some fans even argue that her inclusion in the story does little to enhance the overall tension or stakes of the series.\nOne of the major criticisms surrounding Catherine’s character is her unclear motive and seemingly inconsistent behavior. While she appears to be a mentor figure to Peter Sutherland, her interactions with him often suggest an underlying tension, leading to speculation about whether she has a hidden agenda.\nTrending Fans took to Reddit to discuss Catherine's role in The Night Agent season 2:\n\"I believe the season 1 story line is way better than season 2 though they introduced lot of characters in new season but the thriller is missing I didn’t liked the Catherine’s character, Alice was way better overall watch is worth it’s Peter’s character which is keeping the whole storyline alive. commented one Reddit user. (Image Via whokeshav Reddit The reactions were common among all the fans of The Night Agent season 2 and they did not hold back when it came to expressing it on the Reddit post:\n\"omg i HATED catherine she was such a terrible actress, commented one Reddit user.\" \"The actress must have gotten Botox right before shooting because her face didn’t move at all during the season. The one shot where she is crying but her face has zero emotion because it’s just plastered was too funny. commented another Reddit user. \" This looks like it was written by a bunch of 6th graders. Season 1 was good. The acting in 2 is atrocious and the story line predictable. How are those people following her so easily, until his boss shows up? Interesting. commented one more Reddit user. Meanwhile, there were other users too who were in favor of The Night Agent season 2 being good :\n\"Am i the only one who actually liked season 2?\" commented one Reddit user.\" I also enjoyed season 2, watched everything in one sitting. However, i find the main villain lacking. I was full of anticipation as to how Peter would outwit the main villain then my reaction in the end was \"meh, that was it?\". commented another Reddit user. \" It wasn't necessarily the acting for me, it was they are making characters who are supposed to be smart, do stupid things to force the plot to go in a specific direction. If I'm a spy, I don't need my wife showing up on my job to see what I'm doing! commented another Reddit user.",

    "title": "La chorégraphe de la cérémonie d’ouverture des JO 2024, Maud Le Pladec, porte plainte à son tour pour cyberharcèlement",
    "text": "La directrice de la danse des cérémonies des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques (JOP) de Paris Maud Le Pladec a déposé à son tour une plainte pour cyberharcèlement, ont indiqué jeudi la chorégraphe, le parquet de Paris et une source policière. Maud Le Pladec a expliqué à l’AFP avoir “reçu plusieurs dizaines de mails de menace et messages haineux”. À voir aussi sur Konbini La chorégraphe s’est rendue mercredi au commissariat du centre de Paris pour porter plainte après avoir reçu ces messages de haine et de menaces sur sa personne ainsi que sur le déroulement des cérémonies des JOP entre le 2 et le 4 août, a relaté une source policière. Ces messages ont été envoyés sur son adresse mail personnelle et sur son compte Instagram, a précisé cette source, précisant qu’aucun suspect n’avait pour l’instant été identifié. La plainte de Maud Le Pladec a été jointe à l’enquête ouverte après la plainte pour menaces de mort déposée samedi par les organisateurs de la cérémonie d’ouverture, a indiqué le parquet de Paris. Alexandre Billard, directeur général adjoint de l’agence événementielle Ubi Bene, Thomas Jolly, directeur artistique de la cérémonie d’ouverture, et Thierry Reboul, directeur exécutif des cérémonies des JOP ont déposé une plainte après avoir reçu des menaces de mort. La chorégraphe de la cérémonie d’ouverture a été “victime du même cyberharcèlement”, a précisé le parquet. “En tant que directrice et chorégraphe, on a exposé une vision du monde. J’assume l’entière responsabilité artistique […]. Nous n’avons visé personne, nous n’avons pas créé cette polémique”, a estimé Mme Le Pladec. “L’art fait réagir, il peut être clivant. Le propre de l’art est de communiquer, donc à partir du moment où on communique il y a un dialogue mais ça ne justifie pas le cyberharcèlement et les menaces de mort”, a-t-elle ajouté. “Nous étions avant tout au service d’un projet artistique qui a touché des millions de personnes en France et à l’étranger et qui nous manifestent leur soutien”, selon elle. L’enquête, confiée initialement à la Brigade de répression de la délinquance contre la personne (BRDP), est désormais aux mains de l’Office central de lutte contre les crimes contre l’humanité et les crimes de haine (OCLCH), a indiqué le parquet. La cérémonie d’ouverture de l’événement sportif mondial, le 26 juillet le long de la Seine, a été vivement critiquée par des autorités religieuses et des responsables politiques conservateurs à travers le monde. Des enquêtes ont été ouvertes après les plaintes pour menaces de mort et cyberharcèlement du directeur artistique Thomas Jolly et la DJ française Barbara Butch, militante féministe et lesbienne. La drag-queen Nicky Doll a pour sa part porté plainte contre l’ancien acteur britannique reconverti dans la politique Laurence Fox. Il avait comparé, sur son compte Twitter, les artistes drag-queens participant au tableau “Festivité” de la cérémonie à des “baiseurs d’enfants” ou à des “petits pédophiles déviants”. Une enquête a été ouverte vendredi pour injures publiques.",

    "title": "John John Florence Talks Fatherhood, the Olympics and a Shift In His Competitive Approach",
    "text": "During his 12 years on the Championship Tour,\nJohn John Florence has been no stranger to the yellow jersey. But it’s different now. For the first time in the WSL’s winner-take-all Finals format, John John is the frontrunner where the world title will come down to the best two-out-of-three heats as he waits for the lower-seeded surfers to battle it out for the chance to meet him. He won’t be crowned champion because of his remarkable, season-long run.\nJJF is a fantastic performance surfer. And even better in heavy waves. But it’ll be a tall task to win at Trestles, despite being the number-one seed. The other surfers in the draw are younger, and just as skilled in the air (most of them with less injury history as well). Yes, things have changed for Florence.\nWhen I spoke with John John, he opened up about that and the lessons learned from the Olympics, the balance between his passion for competitive surfing and his love for exploration. And of course how fatherhood has reshaped his perspective.\nLet’s begin with the Olympics. How was that experience for you? Obviously, not the best competitive outcome, but what was the event like?\nYeah, the whole experience was really fun for me. I learned a lot about how I approached the event and how I’d approach it differently in the future. I think I underestimated going and being a part of a team like that — like being part of team USA we’re such a big team. So it was just different to how we do our normal tour. And it was actually really fun to be a part of that, so I thought that part was really cool.\nHow would you compare the Olympics to a typical WSL event?\nIt was a lot more structured. Everything was scheduled — practice surf sessions, how you got to your heat, kind of just everything around the event was a lot more structured. Like you only get to surf between 9:30 and 11:30 with these surfers, and that’s your practice session for the day. Things like that. It was just a different experience, a different way of competing.\nDo you think the Olympics helped bring more attention to surfing? I think about how the photo of Gabriel Medina. Do you think that that’s representative of the attention that surfing got? Or do you think that the event opened people up to the sport of surfing, rather than the spectacle?\nYeah, I think on that day of those waves when that photo was shot. For me, I lost on that day, and it hurt, and it was sad, but when I look back on it now, I’m super stoked. Because for surfing as a whole to get the waves like that on a stage like that, in competition, I thought it was amazing, and kind of unexpected, you know? It was kind of exactly what I thought that surfing needed to really blow up and for people to see it like “whoa, that’s crazy looking.”\nDo you think that shows how powerful surfing’s presence was, even being so far removed from the main event?\nYeah, that’s wild. It just goes to show that even though we were in Tahiti, it didn’t matter. The allure of the waves, the place, the energy — it all came through. It was perfect for showcasing what surfing is all about.\nHave you noticed any changes in how the media covers surfing, especially after the Olympics? How has the energy felt around the sport lately?\nYeah, I think I felt a really good energy toward surfing. To be honest, it’s kind of hard to say. There was definitely a lot of buzz after the Olympics. But it’s hard for me to tell just what kind of buzz it is because I’m so in the surf world. I think I’ll have a better perspective once the tour ends and I can step back a little. For now, it’s hard to see how far the Olympics was able to push surfing.\nTalk about your Samsung partnership. I saw a video you did with Lionel Messi and you’re associated with some big names in the larger sports world. How has that relationship brought you a bigger audience?\nYeah, the Samsung relationship has been really cool. Just to be a part of a team like that, specifically for the Olympics… they’re such a big platform. To be a part of something like that in and around the stage of the Olympics was incredible. It does tie you in to these other big names in other sports, and give you different perspectives on it, which gave me a broader perspective on the whole experience.\nHow did you feel connected to the rest of the Olympics, being so far from Paris?\nYeah, I mean connecting with the rest of the Olympics was definitely tough. We were so far away. And I think everyone did it a little bit different, but for Team USA they had the other sports playing, and we had our opening ceremony at the same time as they did in Paris. So that was fun to be a part of when we did our thing, and then just sat down and watched on a big screen. But I think it’s always a bit tough being that far separated from it.\nDo you think it was worthwhile doing it in Tahiti, and not in France?\nI think with technology and with the connection of the world in this day and age, I think it’s super worth it. Because, like you mentioned that photo of Gabriel – I heard it was one of the most viewed photos of the entire Olympics, which is incredible for surfing to be one of the sports to do that. And I think it goes to show that it didn’t matter if it was in Paris or Tahiti, and just being in Tahiti gives it that allure of the waves and the energy of that place.\nWere there any jokes when the photo came out that it was just a claim, and not a shot in the barrel that went viral?\n(Laughs) Yeah, I mean, I think it’s funny, but it’s a cool photo… like when you look at it and you think, “oh that’s a cool photo.” I see how that would get a lot of attention, you know? But when you know the wave that led to that, it was probably the best wave of the whole event.\nThis is your first Final Five appearance. What do you think of it?\nI think it’s super exciting. It’s a fun way to approach it, because I’ve won two world titles under the old format. It brings back all that nervous energy again. Not really nervous energy, but nervous excitement around something new. It feels like winning a world title for the first time again.\nI guess you feed on that energy as a competitor to have everything boiling down down to a certain moment or just one heat.\nExactly. In both my world titles I wasn’t in the water when I won. Obviously I was really stoked, but it felt a bit anticlimactic. Like you win because someone else loses their heat. And one world title was won before the end of the year, so it was even funnier.\nIt reminds me of 2013 when you won the Triple Crown, Kelly Slater won Pipeline, and Mick Fanning took the world title, but you guys were all in the water winning at different times, in the same event.\nYeah, that was fun too. I felt like there was a lot more going on in surfing at that time, you know? I mean the Triple Crown felt like it was so important and it’s not even a thing anymore. Yeah, just different times in surfing, I guess.\nAre you approaching this finals with a different strategy, knowing it’s just one heat?\nNot really a different strategy, just the culmination of everything I’ve worked on this year. Just knowing what my sweet spot is and how I want to feel before a heat. I think what I’ve been focused on is the small steps and getting myself ready for the event as if it was any other event. And then, you know, knowing that this event does have a lot more attention around it and a lot more pressure, and just spending a lot of time visualizing those feelings of being down there from start to end. My goal is to just be able to go surf without being too tense and just being relaxed and just enjoying surfing, because that’s why I’m here and that’s what I love to do.\nI was looking back at your year and a big highlight was your perfect 10 at Margaret River. In that moment where the wave was closing in on you, did you realize how far off the board you were?\nYeah, I remember that I took off on the wave, and was going up and I was going to do a big a carve, and the wave kind of changed a bit from what I thought it was going to do. And so I kind of had to make a last-minute decision and throw my whole body weight and my tail with the lip, because it was a bit steeper than I was anticipating. So I kind of just threw that out there, and the rest was kind of I guess… I don’t know. When you’re in those moments surfing, it’s just kind of like… flow. And you’re just kind of going with it. And then, all of a sudden, I was up and bottom turning, and then I was like, “okay, here we go.” Like I didn’t know if it looked good, or bad, or what it was.\nWhen you get a 10, do you know it before the score comes in?\nThat one I had no idea, to be honest. Maybe more on the reaction from the announcers right after the wave, and the crowd I could hear… So I was like, “oh maybe that’s actually going to be a big score.” But the other 10 I got at El Sal I thought, “I think this is going to be a 10”.\nAnd that claim you threw afterward was pretty wicked!\nYeah, so in that moment, I definitely felt it was a 10.\nHow long do you want to surf competitively? Is there a point where you say, “okay, I’m ready to move on to the next chapter”?\nYeah, I think that point will come. To be honest, I’m not sure when. I haven’t made any decisions on anything. I know that I enjoyed this year a lot. So I’m just taking it year by year just to see what I’m enjoying doing at the moment. And I feel like I’m at a point in my life where I don’t need to be doing things that I don’t want to do. Which I feel I’m very privileged to get to have the opportunity to get to there.\nI saw another interview where you talked about mindset and confidence changing this year. Can you walk us through what’s different from this year to last?\nYeah, I think this year I’m just 100 percent committed to this tour and doing these events and competing. And you know, in past years, I’ve kind of been half in, half out. And when you’re half in, half out, you don’t do as much work behind the scenes, you’re a little more tense, and losing feels a little more scary. And it just kind of adds to breaking down the confidence. Where now I feel like I’m just committed and, win or lose, whatever I’m doing, I’m going to just keep trying to surf my best. And that, for me, gives me a lot of confidence. And it kind of relaxes me, in a sense. And when I’m relaxed, and I’m having fun, I have a lot of confidence.\nWhat motivated you to give it 100 percent?\nLast year, I hit a low point mentally, right around El Salvador. I didn’t really want to be there, and I was in that stage of half in, half out. And after that event I almost didn’t even want to do the rest of the year. And then I was like, “okay, I’m going to go to Brazil and I’m just going to have fun and relax.” And I went there with that mindset and ended up having a good event, and having such a great time, just being relaxed and enjoying it. And I think that for me really turned things around, going like, “okay, that’s how I like to compete.” And that was a good reminder for me and then I thought, “okay, if I’m committed to the year and I can go in relaxed and just enjoy it, I can set myself up for the best.”\nView this post on Instagram\nHow are you adjusting to fatherhood? It must be a big change from the jet-setting life.\nFatherhood has been amazing. It gives you a whole new perspective and a sense of purpose. Competing is still fun, but now, I know it’s not life or death. I’ve been traveling so much, and it’s tough leaving home, but I’m excited to bring my family with me once my son is a bit older. It’ll be a new way to experience everything.\nHow old is your son now?\nHe’s four months old.\nI just had a son too — he’s four and a half months. It’s amazing watching their little personalities come to life.\nYeah, it’s incredible. Right around this time, he’s really starting to smile and become his own little human. I’m excited to bring him along for more of the journey.\nThe sailing trips you take are the opposite of the whole Olympic spectacle. It seems like a huge yin and yang aspect of life that not many people get to experience. It’s really unique that you get to compete on a world stage and then take off on a sailing trip around the South Pacific. How do you embrace that yin and yang?\nI think for me, sailing and surfing, and going to these places and the curiosity of seeing what’s around the corner is deeply ingrained in me. For whatever reason, it’s something that’s equal to the competitive side. For me, the competing has always been about surfing. Surfing is it for me, regardless of whether I’m surfing in a jersey or not. Being in a jersey is just a different way of doing it. I think it’s a fundamental side of the jersey thing to put yourself into these positions, these high pressure situations, and to try and be able to let go and just surf. But on the flip side of it, going sailing and the challenge of going from Hawaii to Fiji like we did last year, and going under your own power. For me, I just really love the idea of that. When I do get to do that, it just fills me up in a whole different way than competing does. I always loved that part of the ocean.\nHow do you grow when you go on these trips?\nI grow a lot on these trips because of the challenge in itself. There’s a difference between a surf trip where you go somewhere and you fly in and have fun waves and everything is about performance or filming or just in having fun. But sailing has a challenge all around it. It’s like, you’re on day 15 of sailing nonstop and something breaks, and you’re 1,000 miles to Fiji or wherever you are in the ocean and you have to be a good problem solver, which I’m finding I really enjoy that side of it.\nAnd I feel like I’m becoming a better problem solver, and working problems backwards and being able to fix things and keep moving forward. And weirdly enough, I think that learning that helps me apply it to the rest of my life, whether I’m competing and thinking about things mentally or physically. There’s a lot of what I learned on these trips because you have no other choice but to figure out what’s going on.\nCan you give us an example?\nWe broke one of our rudders about 2,000 miles from Fiji and had to make an emergency stop in the Phoenix Islands. We fixed it temporarily, but later the main pin holding the rudder snapped. You don’t want to rely on just one rudder that far out, so it was a constant problem-solving process. We had to figure it out, day by day, adjusting as we went. That’s sailing — something always breaks, and you just have to keep moving forward.\nAs someone with multiple world titles and an Olympic appearance, how has your approach to surfing changed now compared to when you first started?\nI’m much more mindful about what I’m doing now. Early in my career, I just went as fast as I could, trying the biggest airs or turns. Now, I enjoy the process more. Winning is great, but it’s the journey that matters. Last year, I struggled mentally on tour, but this year, I’ve committed to enjoying every step — win or lose, I’m just here to keep pushing and learning. It’s all about growth.",

    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY – A local real estate expert anticipates a strong spring season in the residential market due to lower interest rates. A Realtor.com 2024 forecast predicts mortgage rates will turn the corner in 2024. The prediction is based on the assumption that inflation will continue to cool. National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects Midwest markets like Oklahoma City to experience gains from being in the most affordable region of the U.S. “The demand for housing will recover from falling mortgage rates and rising income,” Yun said in a December statement. “In addition, housing inventory is expected to rise by around 30% as more sellers begin to list after delaying selling over the past two years.” OKCMAR Board President Emilykaye Mitchelson expressed confidence Friday that 2024 will outperform 2023. As one of the nation’s most affordable markets, the Oklahoma City metro is seeing steady price appreciation, unlike more expensive markets like San Francisco, where Redfin reports homeowners are selling at a loss. According to MLS data, the average selling price of a home in the Oklahoma City metro area was $286,146 in November 2023, up $2,855 year-over-year. Mitchelson said 2024 will continue the trend of a stabilizing market, as evidenced by less instances of multiple offers on homes. She said winter is usually the slowest season for the housing market, but industry experts expect a busier spring than last year. “We are still seeing multiple offers on some homes that are priced below $300,000, but some of the higher (priced homes) are sitting a little bit longer,” Mitchelson said. Mitchelson said moderating interest rates in 2024 will bring buyers back into the market and incentivize some fence sitters to put their homes on the market. That’s a trend that may have already started. In November 2023, the Oklahoma City market had 5943 listings, up 656 year-over-year. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.6% last week, according to Freddie Mac. From late October to mid-December, the rate fell by more than a percentage point. Buyer expectations have gradually shifted as the days of sub-4% mortgages become further in the past, Mitchelson said. “While they may be able to buy a little bit less house than if the interest rates were, you know, 3.5% or 4%, they are adjusting and then buying what they can afford, because still, homeownership is one of the greatest wealth-building strategies that we have,” Mitchelson said. Another trend carrying into the new year, Mitchelson said, is the philosophy of marrying the house and dating the mortgage. She said builders and lenders are teaming up to offer different types of mortgage products. “A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is not the only animal in town,” Mitchelson said. “If you can find something that fits your needs, and you can afford to buy it, then you can refinance later.” For those looking to purchase a home in 2024, Mitchelson said it might be a good idea to look in rural areas such as Deer Creek where incentives exist for homebuyers that can get them into the market for an attractive rate. She also suggests working with a realtor, because they will be able to help in negotiating the best deal to fit the buyer’s needs as tight supply continues into 2024.",
