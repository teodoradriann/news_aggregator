    "text": "CHENNAI, Dec 28: After a highly productive 2023, with the successful launch of third Lunar Mission Chandrayaan-3 and the first Sun exploratory Aditya-L1, a buoyant Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will usher in 2024 with the launch of PSLV-C58/X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) mission on January one from the spaceport of Sriharikota.\nThe New year day mission will take place from the First Launch Pad at 0910 hrs, ISRO sources said on Thursday.\nThis mission aims to investigate the polarization of cosmic X-rays.\nThis X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) mission comes in the backdrop of the success of Chandrayaan-3 mission, when them spacecraft landed in the Moon’s south polar region and the successful launch of first solar observation mission Aditya L1 this year with the spacecraft all set to reach the L1 point on January six to explore the outer atmosphere of the sun.\nThis Xpost satellite is designed to remain operational for a minimum of five years and will be used to observe pulsars, X-ray binaries involving black holes, active galactic nuclei, and non-thermal supernova remnants.\nISRO said the first X-Ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) is aiming to investigate the polarization of intense X-Ray sources.\nWhile space-based X-Ray astronomy has been established in India, focusing predominantly on imaging, time-domain studies, and spectroscopy, this upcoming mission marks a major value-addition. The astronomy community is particularly enthused about the prospect of a systematic exploration into the polarization of X-Rays emitted by astronomical sources.\nThis research, supplementing traditional time and frequency domain studies, introduces a novel dimension to X-Ray astronomy, generating anticipation and excitement within the scientific community.\nThe XPoSat spacecraft is designated for observation from Low Earth Orbit (non-sun synchronous orbit of 650 km altitude, low inclination of 6 degree), carrying two scientific payloads.\nWith the two payloads, the XPoSat mission is capable of simultaneous studies of temporal, spectral, and polarization features of the bright X-Ray sources. The mission objectives include measurement of X-Ray polarization in the energy band of 8-30 keV emanated from X-Ray sources and long-term spectral and temporal studies of cosmic X-Ray sources in the energy band of 0.8-15 keV.\nThe mission life is expected to be 5 years.\nThe payloads onboard XPoSat will observe the X-Ray sources during its transit through the Earth’s shadow, i.e., during the eclipse period.\nThe primary payload of XPoSat, POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-rays), is designed to measure polarimetry parameters-specifically the degree and angle of polarization-in the medium X-ray energy range of 8-30 keV photons originating from astronomical sources. Complementing this, the XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing) payload will provide spectroscopic information within the energy range of 0.8-15 keV.\nThe POLIX payload is developed by the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, with support from the ISRO centres. The XSPECT payload is developed by the U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), ISRO.\nThe POLIX payload serves as an X-ray Polarimeter designed for astronomical observations within the energy band of 8-30 keV. The instrument comprises a collimator, a scatterer, and four X-ray proportional counter detectors surrounding the scatterer. The scatterer, constructed from low atomic mass material, induces anisotropic Thomson scattering of incoming polarized X-rays. The collimator plays a crucial role in restricting the field of view to 3 degrees by 3 degrees, ensuring that only one bright source is within the field of view for most observations. POLIX’s primary objective is to observe bright astronomical sources across various categories during the planned 5-year lifetime of the XPoSat mission. Notably, POLIX stands out as the first payload in the medium X-ray energy band specifically dedicated to polarimetry measurements.\nXSPECT is an X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing instrument, designed to offer fast timing and excellent spectroscopic resolution in soft X-rays (0.8-15 keV). XSPECT also monitors changes in line flux and profile, offering simultaneous, long-term temporal monitoring of soft X-ray emission. The instrument employs an array of Swept Charge Devices (SCDs) with an effective area exceeding 30 cm? at 6 keV and an impressive energy resolution of less than 200 eV at 6 keV.\nXSPECT employs passive collimators to reduce background by narrowing its field of view. This payload is anticipated to observe a variety of sources, including X-ray pulsars, black hole binaries, low-magnetic field neutron stars (NS), active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and magnetars. (UNI)",

    "text": "By Ashley ,\n3 hours ago A former fuel truck driver pleaded guilty to charges related to a deliberate fuel spill that occurred in Pennsylvania in 2021.\nNew Jersey resident George Smith, 39, pleaded guilty in a Delaware County court to felony prohibition against other pollution and felony causing a catastrophe, according to Patch.com .\nThe charges stem from a gas dumping incident that occurred near an elementary school in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania, in 2021 , killing wildlife and forcing the the school into a long-term closure.\nSmith was accused of dumping 4000 gallons of gas on June 11, 2021, at the Gas N Go in Brookhaven in an attempt to speed up his work day.\nAs his work day began, Smith filled up with 8500 gallons of gas to begin his daily deliveries.\nSmith reportedly deviated from his route and went first to a Gas N Go location that was meant to be his last stop. Because another tanker truck driver had already delivered to that location earlier in the day, Smith was only able to fill up the gas station’s underground tanks with 4500 gallons of gas.\nAuthorities say that Smith would have had to make a partial fill up at his next stop and then go back to the fuel depot, adding time to his day’s deliveries.\nSurveillance video showed Smith at the Gas N Go location placing the fuel hose on the ground next to the guard rail and dumping the remaining 4000 gallons of gas down an embankment.\n“We have determined that the defendant’s deliberate actions caused this fuel discharge. Motivated by a desire to speed up his route, the defendant poured in excess of 4000 gallons of gasoline over an embankment bordering an elementary school – causing damage to a nearby stream, wildlife and vegetation and resulting in the closure of the school. As a fuel delivery driver, the defendant was entrusted with a hazardous product – gasoline – and he owed a duty of care to all of us. He chose self-interest over the safety of the Brookhaven community and the safety of the children at Coebourn Elementary School. One of my first actions as District Attorney was to establish an Environmental Crimes Unit, and this prosecution should send a message that we will pursue and prosecute those who commit crimes against our environment,” said Delaware County District Attorney Stollsteimer when charges were announced in 2021 .\nMore than 100 truck’s worth of contaminated soil were removed from the area.\nThe post Driver accused of dumping 4000 gallons of gas ‘to speed up his route’ pleads guilty appeared first on CDLLife .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "KANASÍN, Yucatán, 28 de diciembre de 2023.- Un crecimiento para todos y no para unos cuantos es posible con los principios de la Cuarta Transformación, afirmó la precandidata única de la coalición “Sigamos Haciendo Historia” a la Presidencia de la República, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, tras sostener un encuentro con militantes y simpatizantes en Kanasín, Yucatán.\nDurante su discurso, la precandidata de Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena), Partido del Trabajo (PT) y Partido Verde Ecologista de México (PVEM) señaló en un comunicado que en Yucatán hay un desarrollo desigual que solo beneficia a unos cuantos, por lo que es necesario abrir paso a la 4T para que la prosperidad sea compartida con los que menos tienen.\n“Somos humanistas, nosotros no queremos desarrollo solo para algunos cuantos, para nosotros no hay prosperidad si la prosperidad no se comparte y eso es importante en Yucatán, donde ha habido un crecimiento tan desigual, sí hay progreso, pero no solo lo queremos para unos, queremos distribuir la riqueza, queremos que los que menos tienen tengan la posibilidad de tener una vida digna”, aseveró.\nEn el encuentro, aprovechó para desmentir la campaña de desprestigio en Yucatán contra la 4T en materia de seguridad, pues recordó que cuando fue Jefa de Gobierno en la Ciudad de México logró reducir a la mitad la incidencia delictiva, en contraste a Guanajuato, que es gobernado por el PAN y que es considerado el estado más inseguro del país.\n“Que no les digan, que no les cuenten, porque ya vi por ahí una propaganda que dice: ‘Si llega Morena va a llegar la inseguridad a Yucatán’, puro cuento. El estado más inseguro del país es Guanajuato y lo gobierna el PAN, así que es falso; cuando fui Jefa de Gobierno disminuí a la mitad la inseguridad”, aseguró.\nAsimismo, destacó los logros en esta primera etapa de la transformación de la mano del Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, entre los que sobresale la inauguración del Tren Maya para traer desarrollo al sureste mexicano y el rescate de empresas que fueron privatizadas por gobiernos neoliberales como fue Mexicana de Aviación.\n“Lo mismo en Mexicana, la privatizaron, la regalaron, la tronaron y después desapareció una línea aérea nacional, pero la Cuarta Transformación no solo sube al tren, también vuela por los cielos, ya inició el vuelo Mexicana de Aviación, una empresa nacional que va a dar desarrollo a nuestro país”, manifestó.\nFinalmente, expuso que la educación es fundamental en el proyecto de nación de la 4T y compartió el sueño de seguir garantizando el acceso gratuito a la educación superior como un derecho fundamental para mexicanas y mexicanos, tal y como lo hizo en la Ciudad de México con la construcción de las Universidades de la Salud y la Rosario Castellanos, donde ahora estudian más de 50 mil jóvenes.\n“La educación transforma la mente, transforma a las personas, la educación humanista transforma a las naciones”, puntualizó.\nPor su parte, el precandidato a la gubernatura de Yucatán, Joaquín “Huacho” Díaz Mena, aclaró que el enemigo a vencer es la desigualdad que hay en el estado, promovida por gobernantes que no entienden las necesidades del pueblo.\n“El enemigo a vencer es la desigualdad que existe en Yucatán, desigualdad causada por autoridades clasistas, elitistas, que atienden solamente a unos cuantos, a sus amigos y se olvidan de las necesidades del pueblo. No nos atienden porque no nos entienden”, concluyó.",

    "text": "[Find out how we test here.](https://www.pcguide.com/how-we-test/)\nThe launch of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D was a massive success for AMD. Known as the new [best CPU for gaming](https://www.pcguide.com/cpu/guide/best-for-gaming/), the 9800X3D sold out within minutes at most retailers – including Amazon. While stock levels were recovering at a certain point and the processor enjoyed a decent amount of time in stock at the popular retailer, it is now (again) unavailable.\nYou can keep an eye on how the gaming chip is doing in our [9800X3D stock tracker](https://www.pcguide.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-stock-tracker-stock-availability-for-the-biggest-retailers/), but for now, it’s tough to order one online. In what looks like an attempt to capitalize on the low availability, listings have started flooding Amazon with a cheap price tag.\n- Cores: 8\n- Threads: 16\n- Boost clock speed: 5.2GHz\n- Base clock speed: 4.7GHz\n- L3 cache: 96MB\n- TDP: 120W\n- Platform: AM5\nMultiple 9800X3D listings with $199 price tag appear on Amazon\nAt surface level, this looks like a classic scam – and it probably is. So, we wouldn’t recommend buying one of these and instead wait for the [official 9800X3D listing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=pcg-news-affiliate-173-20) to come back in stock. With even a tiny bit of investigative work, you’ll find that the sellers seem like spam accounts, and the $199 price tag (far below the CPU’s $479 MSRP) is too good to be true.\nTop 5 Black Friday deals\nThis year's Black Friday has officially kickstarted, offering up huge discounts on some of the market's leading tech products. Below, we'll list the best Black Friday deals we can find - from now until Cyber Monday.\n[Skytech Gaming Azure4070 Gaming PC Desktop - WAS $1,899.99 NOW $1,549.99 Save - $350](https://www.amazon.com/Skytech-Gaming-Azure-PC-Desktop/dp/B0C2C1PQZD?tag=pcg-news-affiliate-173-20)[Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT - WAS $569.99 NOW $499.99 Save - $70](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFX69R1R?tag=pcg-news-affiliate-173-20)[WD_BLACK 8TB SN850X NVMe - WAS $879.99 NOW $549.99 Save - $330](https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0D9WT512W?tag=pcg-news-affiliate-173-20)[ASUS ROG Swift 32” 4K OLED Gaming Monitor - WAS $1,299 NOW $999 Save - $300](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG32UCDM/dp/B0CV26XVMD?tag=pcg-news-affiliate-173-20)[Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth 5.1 Headphones - WAS $349 NOW $199 Save - $150](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=pcg-news-affiliate-173-20)\nPrices correct as of November 22nd, 2024.\nMore interesting details can be found in the supposed specs lists. For example, we don’t think the 9800X3D is compatible with the LGA 1156 socket, nor is it manufactured by IBM. Plus, $199.89 for a “1.2GHz Cortex A8 Processor” doesn’t sound like a good deal to us. In any case, these listings clearly don’t look legitimate, so we hope no one falls victim to this scam.\nWhile Amazon is generally a great place to find new PC hardware, it can serve as a host for these kinds of fake spam products. While you wait for the 9800X3D to be in stock again, have a read of our [AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D review](https://www.pcguide.com/cpu/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/) if you want to learn more about why it is the best gaming CPU on the market.\nSome recent positive news comes from retailers such as Mindfactory in Germany, which [reports sales in the thousands](https://www.pcguide.com/news/one-retailer-reports-its-9800x3d-sales-are-in-the-thousands-as-stock-levels-begin-to-recover/) for the popular processor. We expect it to be hotly contested for a while, especially since Black Friday is a great time to upgrade your PC; not that we expect any deals on the 9800X3D specifically.",
