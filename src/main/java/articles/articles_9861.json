    "text": "As floodwaters swamped East Nagpur and civic officials vanished from view, the residents of Sainagar didn’t wait for help — they became the help.\nWith lanes submerged, homes flooded, and no emergency response in sight, locals pooled ₹7,000 from 12 households and hired a JCB machine themselves. “Children were trapped, and elders couldn’t move. We had no choice,” said Vijay Patil, who contributed ₹500. “We needed action, not promises.”\nSameer Wankhede, a local JCB operator known for responding in crises, arrived within an hour. “It was chaos,” he said. “Water had no place to go. So we created one.” With help from residents, Sameer used the machine’s bucket to unblock choked drains and carve out temporary channels to redirect floodwater into a nearby nullah.\nThe effort lasted over four hours. Residents like Mehnaz Begum and Suresh Joshi stood in knee-deep water, clearing slush and guiding Sameer’s every move. “He didn’t just do his job — he became one of us,” said Joshi.\nWhile the Nag and Pili rivers had overflowed, backflow was worsened by plastic-choked drains and zero official support. Not a single NMC team reached the area until late evening.\nTeacher Sandhya Kale put it bluntly: “If citizens can respond this fast, why can’t the authorities?”\nSainagar may have drained out, but the real flood was of courage, unity — and one JCB operator who showed up when the government didn’t.\n👉 Click here to read the latest Gujarat news on TheLiveAhmedabad.com",

Об этом сообщили в лаборатории солнечной астрономии ИКИ и ИСЗФ.\nПо данным специалистов, мощность бури не превысит 5 баллов. Это равно слабой магнитной бури.\n\"Специалисты напоминают, что даже слабые геоудары могут отразиться на электронике и состоянии метеозависимых людей\", - пишет издание.\nВ такие периоды советуют чаще гулять на свежем воздухе, соблюдать умеренную физическую активность, правильно питаться, спать необходимое количество часов. Также рекомендуют избегать стрессов.\nПрогноз магнитных бурь на месяц\nУченые ожидают, что следующий всплеск геомагнитной активности произойдет уже на следующей неделе, 10-11 июля, сообщает ura.ru.\nТакже сильную магнитную бурю прогнозируют 22-23 июля. 7, 12, 13, 21, 28, 29 числа ожидается повышенная геомагнитная активность, которая не приведет к шторму.\nТем не менее стоит учитывать, что прогнозы на месяц вперед могут оказаться неточными. Несмотря на то, что сейчас на Солнце почти нет вспышек, никто не застрахован от внезапной активности на звезде. Поэтому метеозависимым людям лучше регулярно проверять прогнозы геомагнитной активности на ближайшие несколько дней.\nЧитайте по теме:\nМагнитная буря 29–30 мая 2025 года стала рекордной по длительности – ученые\nПОДПИСЫВАЙТЕСЬ НА НАС В TELEGRAM\nУзнавайте о новостях первыми\nПодписаться",

    "text": "The severe winter weather in Waterloo Region has not only impacted the roads, but blood donations as well. Canadian Blood Services says they have seen hundreds of last-minute cancellations due to the poor weather. Other cities across the province that were hit by the storms, including Guelph and London, are noting donations being cancelled.\nThe drop in donations also means that optimal levels for blood products, such as whole blood and plasma, are down. The most recent update from Canadian Blood Services shows four blood types, including A-, B-, O+ and O- are all below the eight-day supply nationally.\nRelated:\nLarge demand for blood donations this holiday season in Waterloo Region ‘Not a big deal,’ says Laurier employee logging his 70th blood donation With elective surgeries ramping up, blood donations are needed Rachael Henderson, the Community Development Manager at Canadian Blood Services, said donating during the winter is especially important because blood products are more in demand now than they have been in the last 10 years.\n“There has been an increase in surgeries and treatments that require blood products,” said Henderson. “That also goes back to the fact that the population is aging and growing. So you see the number of units of blood increase that are needed.”\nHenderson adds the donation centre in Waterloo at 94 Bridgeport Rd. E. has several open appointments for those looking to donate.\nCanadian Blood Services have been pushing to have 450 new donors every day this winter to help keep up with demand.\nThe national inventory by blood type as of February 20, 2025 (Screenshot from Canadian Blood Services) Submit a Correction Accessibility Feedback Top Stories Trump’s comments heighten tensions as Canada, U.S. meet in 4 Nations final The charged political atmosphere surrounding the 4 Nations Face-Off final between Canada and the United States escalated further before Thursday's puck drop with another inflammatory social media post...\n6h ago\nMother Nature providing a near-perfect 90th for Chicopee Ski Hill It has been a tough few years for the operators of Chicopee Ski Hill in Kitchener.
