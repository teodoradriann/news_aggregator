    "text": "Every day, T. Nixon seeks whatever food he can find in Bend, and not just because he’s hungry. Nixon has lupus, an incurable disease in which the immune system attacks its own tissue. Left untreated, it can be serious, sometimes causing severe kidney damage. Nixon’s medication, which he keeps loose in his pockets, must be taken with food, or risk severe stomach problems. But Nixon, who is homeless, has no place to store food at the shelter where he’s staying on Second Street in Bend, which provides most of his daily meals. He thinks about his favorite soul food back home in North Carolina, but here, his food stamps don’t afford him much, maybe $60 he spends mostly on TV dinners. “I just want a real meal, something that’ll fill me up,” said Nixon, 33. Nixon’s daily struggle highlights what unfolds every day across Central Oregon, according to outreach workers, advocates and people experiencing homelessness. Homelessness makes hunger extra challenging As the region reports a rise in homelessness amid surging housing prices, its hundreds of unhoused residents are facing greater challenges than ever before in finding consistent, nutritious meals. They must make critical decisions around what they can afford, often choosing between paying for basic nutrition and fuel to heat whatever shelter they have. Some struggle to find transportation and show up on time for meals at local shelters or community kitchens, all the more challenging if they’re ill, injured or caught in bad weather. Others do not own kitchen appliances and, if they do, cannot wash them. Many have practically no way to store what food they have and cannot navigate their dietary restrictions, forced to make do with whatever is available. That means they must often depend on nonperishable foods — dried fruit, canned soup, instant ramen — rather than nutritious, warm meals and fresh fruits and vegetables. “It’s hard to get food stamps, and you don’t know where to get nice, warm food,” said Rayling Garcia, who is 50 and homeless. Garcia is a year sober from a methamphetamine addiction that left her bound to her tent, crying, unable to get up and find food. “When you’re using, you don’t want food, you just want more drugs,” said Garcia. Now, she catches the bus every day from her shelter in Redmond to get meals from Shepherd’s House Ministries in Bend. “If you ask, you can get help,” she said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a sandwich or a chicken bone.” Meanwhile, the struggle for ample nutrition can make it harder to attend housing appointments, substance abuse treatment, court appearances and many other things that may lead someone to homelessness. “Food becomes the focus of their entire schedule,” said Gary Hewitt, the executive director for St. Vincent de Paul Bend. Some advocates say things have only gotten worse for some homeless people as authorities have swept encampments again and again over the past year, leaving people scattered across town and sometimes living in areas like China Hat Road and Juniper Ridge, far from local shelters and kitchens serving meals. “It seems that people are finding it much more difficult to have their basic needs met,” said Eric Garrity, of the Bend Equity Project. Garrity travels weekly to provide meals in Juniper Ridge, a 1,500-acre area of publicly-owned land on the northeast outskirts of Bend. He said many people lost their jobs and homes during the pandemic economic downturn and have since found it harder to afford consistent meals. With winter now here, Garrity said he is especially concerned for the people who were swept. “It’s a hard time of year to be further away from town,” he said. Tim Ellis, who works for Shepherd’s House Ministries, also provides weekly outreach services in the Juniper Ridge area, often bringing cold soup, ramen and other canned goods to people who need them. Ellis said some people he helps work full-time jobs but can’t store food well because they don’t have an apartment or house due to high housing costs. “There seems to be an idea that it’s a simple fix, that it’s something that can be dealt with by a person going to work,” said Ellis. “That’s simply not true.” Shelters help, but people need more John Lodise, director of low-barrier service for Shepherd’s House Ministries, said it offers as many as 300 meals a day at its shelters in Bend and Redmond. But ensuring residents have ample food while keeping the shelters full is a challenge. Health rules and concerns over infestation and sanitation mean that shelter employees cannot allow people to bring in their own food. In addition, refrigeration space is limited. This requires staff to tell residents that whatever food they bring into a shelter they must eat in a day. But Lodise said it’s essential that people get consistent access to food for reasons that go beyond health. Food, he said, can be empowering. “That’s a source of connection to the rest of society,” he said. Hewitt said staff members used to provide a handful of sack lunches a day, but now provide 50. Often, they give out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, dried fruits and meats, protein bars and other foods that don’t necessarily require utensils. Hewitt said a potential solution could be providing additional pop-up pantries, where people load trucks with nearly expired foods, drive them out to people and hand them out. He said resources like these are even more essential during the holiday season, when some facilities offering food may close. “It’s not getting better. It’s getting worse. It’s up to the community to solve it,” Hewitt said of food insecurity. He added, “There’s no reason a person should go hungry in this town.” On Thursday, Nixon looked in the refrigerator at the Lighthouse Navigation Center, a shelter, and finally found the food he needed to take his medication. It was a plastic package of sushi, recently donated. He placed his food on a plate, doused it in soy sauce and walked outside to talk to his wife. He ate while standing by the entry to a Walgreens parking lot, smiling and laughing. He set his food down. Moments later, a car entering the parking lot crossed over the sidewalk and drove over his food. It wasn’t clear if it was intentional or an accident, but Nixon looked stunned, angry. “I wanna fight them,” he said, biting his lip, staring.

    "title": "Letters: Attacks on ‘immigrants’ show a lack of historical knowledge",
    "text": "Riot police form a line on the Lower Ormeau Road THE recent attacks on people from different countries have raised challenges to Europe’s ideology and democracy. I do wonder whether the Churches have done enough in this. Apart from the Bishop of Down and Connor who called for calm and prudence, very little has been said. How was the message preached in all our parishes? In such situations the Gospel message should be contextual. The attacks on what we call ‘immigrants’ show a lack of historical knowledge. In a country like Ireland, where there are far more emigrants away from home than the citizens, this is contradictory to reality. We in the West did condemn Robert Mugabe when he repossessed white farmers’ property and rightly so. Do people know that there are European people in Africa with large business empires? In Uganda where I come from, an Irish businessman is flourishing without any hindrance. Besides political and geo-economical influences, our faith is seriously challenged. People are asking whether we are reading the same Bible. ‘I was a stranger, and you welcomed me’ (Matthew 25:35). How do we interpret that message in our time? How can a country that claims to be a source of Christianity turn against strangers and pilgrims? I am just worried how fast we forget history – do we remember the horrendous acts of ancestors during the colonial and slavery periods? King Leopold in Congo, the Germans in West Africa, the British in East and Central Africa up to as late as the 1960s? But even next door, do Irish people remember such inscriptions as ‘No Irish, no dogs and no blacks?’ It was said that a miracle happened when the tricolour flew next to the Union flag for the first time. The question remains, will the tricolour be respected forever from now? Will the two communities march together on the Twelfth? Above all let us go beyond emotions and turn to our Christian identity, imitating Christ, for in Him there is no more Jew or Gentile, white or black. REV CHARLES LWANGA KAWEESI Portglenone Monastery Democracy is less today for loss of voices in local politics LAST week ‘Feeney on Friday’ embarked on his journey providing an analysis of the mainstream parties within our political system. In his first column on this journey, Brian managed to frame Stormont as a toy town assembly, People Before Profit were described with a shorthand title Brian within the same sentence admitted they’d reject as mis-representation, and he summarised the efforts of the TUV and PBP in the Northern Irish political system to less than a row of beans. While there is some truth in the analysis, it’s easy to be overwhelmingly negative about the smaller parties; it’s punching down. This week it will be interesting to see if ‘Feeney on Friday’ can provide a fair analysis of the SDLP. Can he recognise Stormont needs an opposition in order to better politics, and at this time there are articulate voices in opposition such as Matthew O’Toole MLA and Sinead McLaughlin MLA? Will he share the view that constitutional change on this island towards a new Ireland will be more difficult to achieve when left to one single nationalist party and acknowledge that representation at all levels of politics can bring successes, such as ensuring Labour made a commitment to repeal the legacy act and lives up to that commitment? Our democracy is less today for the loss of voices in local politics such as Clare Bailey, Dawn Purvis and David Adams from elected mainstream positions. If we strive to create three blocs, we lose the diversity virtue of minorities. Northern Ireland is now a collection of minorities – agreed, some larger than others – however, it is not just orange and green with yellow in the middle, and to provide such an analysis in an effort to punch down smaller parties would be as big a rejection of the future of Northern Ireland as it would be to bury your head in the sand about constitutional change. GERARD MCDONALD Belfast BT10 ‘You reap what you sow’ has never been so apt ON June 7, long before the tragic events in Southport, I wrote a letter to The Irish News regarding racism in the north of Ireland. Part of that letter – which wasn’t printed – read: “While there have definitely been racist and sectarian incidents emanating in nationalist areas, there appears to be a far greater intolerance to those of a different race or religion from the Protestant/loyalist/unionist community.” I would reiterate that comment, as the geographical locations of continuing racist events clearly shows that to be the case. What is also of importance is that it has been reported that loyalist paramilitaries have been involved in encouraging and orchestrating these attacks, yet elements of the British government, executive, councils etc continue to pander to these organisations by consulting with them and ensuring funding is directed towards them. This is so, even though we are about 30 years after these organisations declared they were on ceasefire and yet they continue to recruit and arm themselves, and everyone knows of involvement in criminality, extortion, drug dealing etc. “You reap what you sow” has never been so apt when it comes to pandering to so-called loyalism, which while having in impact on the whole society probably has a more significant deleterious effect on the community that it claims to protect.

    "text": "WORLD\nSpanish Catholic Church suspends priest accused of selling Viagra\nA Spanish priest has been temporarily suspended by the Roman Catholic Church after he was accused of selling drugs including the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra.\nThe clergyman from Don Benito, a town of around 35,000 residents in the western Extremadura region, was detained Monday on suspicion of \"trafficking narcotic substances\", the diocese of Plasencia, which is responsible for his parish, said in a statement Thursday.\nAfter his arrest, the priest, whose identity has been withheld, was provisionally released by the investigating judge, the diocese said, expressing its \"pain and dismay at the suffering and scandal\" caused by the events.\nWhile it waits for a \"clarification\" of what happened, the diocese said it felt it was \"appropriate, at this time, to temporarily remove him from the public exercise of the ministry and from his office as parish priest\".\nThe clergyman has been offered \"psychological and spiritual accompaniment\", the statement said.\nSpanish media said the priest was involved in the trafficking of Viagra, aphrodisiacs and narcotics along with a second arrested man, whom the reports said was his lover.\nThe two men, who had been under police surveillance for several months, used a home rented by the priest to store the products, according to the online newspaper El Espanol, which said the news caused \"disbelief\" among the parish's faithful.",
