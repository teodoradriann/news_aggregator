    "text": "Les cinémas français ont enregistré une hausse de fréquentation de presque 20% en 2023 par rapport à 2022. La tendance s'applique aussi aux Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Dans les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, il y a ceux qui n'ont pas eu l'occasion de fréquenter les cinémas pour diverses raisons. \"Je n'avais pas les moyens financiers\", explique Sabrina. \"Je préfère la lecture\", avance Yandrick.\nPourtant, la France a enregistré une hausse de fréquentation de 18,9% en 2023 par rapport à 2022. Les cinémas ont compté 180,6 millions d'entrées. Dans les rues de Manosque, Noélie, Héléna et Karine reconnaissent s'être rendues plus souvent au cinéma. Un ressenti qui confirme plutôt la tendance nationale.\nLes petites structures résistent Le département ne compte qu'un seul cinéma de type multiplexe avec 8 salles à Manosque. Pour autant, les petites structures ne sont pas boudées, bien au contraire. \"Cinéma de pays\" travaille en itinérance dans toutes les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et est présent sur une trentaine de communes.\n\"On a eu une dizaine de pourcents d'augmentation de la fréquentation\", explique Lorenzo Ciesco, directeur de l'association. \"La particularité du cinéma français c'est d'être résilient\", s'exclame-t-il. Malgré un tableau global satisfaisant, la fréquentation de 2023 est tout de même à nuancer. Elle reste toujours en baisse par rapport à celle d'avant la crise sanitaire.\nLaurie Charrié, avec Milan Busignies Les plus lus\nTOUT COMPRENDRE - Plaintes contre plaintes, comment la famille d’Alain Delon se déchire",

    "title": "Watch: California coast battered by massive waves",
    "text": "01:18 VENTURA, Calif. – Monster waves from a powerful Pacific storm battered beach towns up and down the California coast Thursday, leaving at least eight people injured and a string of coastal communities cleaning up from seawater intrusions.\nFrom San Diego to Los Angeles and north beyond San Francisco , the National Weather Service issued Coastal Flood Warnings and High Surf Warnings for breaking waves between 28 and 33 feet. Some locations were forecast to see waves as high as 40 feet.\nSTRONG EL NINO WINTER: WHAT KIND OF WEATHER YOU CAN EXPECT\n01:06 The massive waves overtook beaches and coastal roads. Some even crashed against homes and businesses.\nWHAT IS A SNEAKER WAVE?\n00:55 In Southern California&apos;s Ventura County, a massive wave crashed through and over beach barriers , sending a surge of water rushing inland and catching several onlookers by surprise. Video from the chaotic scene showed people scrambling to escape the wave with at least one car carried inland in the floodwaters. Eight people were sent to the hospital with minor injuries, according to the Ventura County Sheriff&apos;s Office.\n8 INJURED AS MASSIVE WAVE SMASHES INTO BEACH SPECTATORS NEAR LOS ANGELES\n00:31 There were multiple incidents that first responders had to attend to along the coastline. However, none of the injuries reported were life-threatening.\nIn addition, Ventura County firefighters were called to the Oxnard Harbor, where a fisherman fell overboard into the cold water Thursday evening. Fortunately, the fisherman was rescued and is expected to recover.\nThe debris from the coastal flooding deposited on streets was so heavy that road crews used plows to clear the scenic State Highway 1, south of San Francisco. Other stretches of the road were too buried to clear.\nnext Image 1 of 5\nprev next Image 2 of 5\nprev next Image 3 of 5\nprev next Image 4 of 5\nprev Image 5 of 5 Officials issued evacuation orders for several northern and central California coastal communities.\nResidents said they were shocked to see the waves so large. Many went to the beaches to get pictures and videos. One video shows shocked photographers screaming and running from a monster wave in Capitola.\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n02:23 \"Before anyone says anything, right after a bigger wave came, everyone was asked to leave and evacuate the Esplanade,\" Yesica Guzman posted on social media . \"The cops were making sure everyone was safe. No one got injured due to the waves, at least no one near us. Shortly after this video, everyone received the evacuation notices and the cops evacuated anyone near.\"\nCALIFORNIA BEACH HOME TO SOME OF LARGEST WAVES IN THE WORLD\n01:25 \"We put evacuation warnings into place around 8 a.m. (Thursday) morning for this area, and, as you can see, these waves are incredibly powerful,\" Ashley Keehn, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&apos;s Office Information Officer, told KTVU FOX 2 . \"They&apos;re washing logs up here. A lot of debris, a lot of driftwood. So we&apos;ve been asking people to avoid the direct coastal area.\"\nNot everyone heeded the advice, however, and ended up soaked.\nACTIVE EL NINO PATTERN DELIVERS WITH SURF AS HIGH AS 50 FEET IN PACIFIC\nThe rescue crews in Ventura County were kept busy dealing with numerous rescue and injury calls due to the high waves that caused damage to houses and swept onlookers off piers and beaches. One wave, estimated to be 20 feet high, smashed onto an ocean pier.\nDangerously high surf, coastal flooding threats return Saturday According to the NWS, high surf will decrease a little on Friday but will increase again on Saturday as powerful Pacific cyclones continue to send massive swells toward the West Coast, renewing coastal flooding threats. A storm offshore Wednesday measured at a peak minimum pressure of 960 millibars was followed close behind Thursday by another storm measuring as low as 970 millibars at its peak strength, according to NOAA surface analysis charts.\nWaves through Saturday are expected to reach as high as 15-20 feet with sets to 25 feet along the central California coast, and 10-15 feet with sets to 20 feet along hard-hit Ventura County.\n\"These are forecast to be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS conditions, as powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures such as piers and jetties,\" The NWS wrote Thursday night. \"Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years.\"\nHOW WEATHER IMPACTS WAVES DURING SURFING COMPETITIONS\nCoastal Flood Warnings and High Surf Warnings remain in effect in Southern California until Saturday night, with the worst of the flooding expected during high tide.\nDue to the High Surf Warnings, all Oxnard public beaches are closed through Sunday.\n\"Use caution at the beach and stay well back from the water&apos;s edge,\" the NWS warned. \"There is a high risk of ocean drowning for surfers and beachgoers.\"\nTags Ocean California Winter Weather Beaches Extreme Weather West",

    "text": "According to multiple reports, Will Wade, a Clemson alum and former Tigers graduate assistant (2005-07), has agreed to become the next head coach at NC State.\nWade has experienced significant success as head coach of McNeese State, capturing two consecutive Southland Conference championships. His career includes previous head coaching roles at Chattanooga, VCU, and LSU. During his time at LSU (2017-22), Wade led the Tigers to three NCAA Tournament appearances but was dismissed due to NCAA violations that resulted in a 10-game suspension carried over to his tenure at McNeese.\nWade confirmed his communication with NC State during a press conference Wednesday morning, acknowledging openly the ongoing speculation about his future. \"Just tell it like it is,\" Wade said. He stressed the importance of transparency with his players, especially with their NCAA Tournament matchup against Clemson approaching on Thursday afternoon.\nHe enters the NC State role with an overall coaching record of 243-104, along with seven NCAA Tournament appearances.\nNC State parted ways with previous coach Kevin Keatts after an inconsistent tenure, highlighted by a Final Four appearance in 2024 but failing to qualify for the ACC Tournament this season. Keatts concluded his Wolfpack tenure with a 151-113 record.\nClemson and McNeese State will face off Thursday afternoon in Providence at 3:15 p.m. ET, airing on TruTV.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
