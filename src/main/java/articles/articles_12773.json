    "title": "Plymouth Argyle: Blackburn Rovers, Ibrahim Cissoko talk will have Greens unsettled",
    "text": "Ibrahim Cissoko’s future as a Plymouth Argyle player has been thrown into jeopardy over recent days, with rumours arising of a move away from Home Park for the Dutchman.\nAccording to transfer fanatic Alan Nixon, fellow Championship side Blackburn Rovers are interested in bringing the Toulouse FC loanee to Ewood Park for the remainder of the campaign, as John Eustace looks to bolster his side’s options in the final third.\nWhile Argyle reportedly have first refusal on Cissoko should an offer come in for him this winter, the most prominent question is whether the Pilgrims will want the forward to remain at Home Park for the next few months, given the change of management in recent weeks.\nWith Wayne Rooney’s emphasis on playing free-flowing football being replaced by the more attritional style of Miron Muslic, it remains unclear how Cissoko will be fitting into those plans going forward, with a parting of ways potentially the best option during the transfer window.\nBlackburn Rovers eye up move for Ibrahim Cissoko\nNixon’s report on Wednesday stated that Rovers are considering a move for Cissoko this winter, with the Netherlands under-21 international struggling to get game time after returning from injury at the start of the month.\nIf Cissoko does move to Lancashire, he would follow in the footsteps of former teammate Adam Forshaw, who made the move back to the north west earlier in the month after having his contract at Home Park cancelled by mutual consent.\nIbrahim Cissoko's 2024/25 campaign at Plymouth Argyle ( |\n|\n---|---|\n(All competitions) |\n|\nAppearances |\n15 |\nGoals |\n3 |\nAssists |\n2 |\n(As of January 30th, 2025) |\nJust like the former Leeds United man, Cissoko has had his supporters and his detractors during his time in green, with his flair and unpredictability on the left-hand side proving too hot to handle on occasion, while also leaving Janners gesticulating at his carelessness in possession.\nWith three goals this season - including a brace against Luton Town back in September - the 21-year-old has proven he can be quite the menace when given the opportunity to thrive in a team that allows him to do so, but with the changing of the guard in PL2, those chances are likely to be fewer and farther between if he remains as a Pilgrim past February 3.\nMiron Muslic appointment may have ended Ibrahim Cissoko's Plymouth Argyle career\nMiron Muslic has not wasted anytime in letting his players, the Green Army, and the football world what he expects since taking over the reins at Home Park earlier this year, with the Austrian demanding aggression, physicality, and a consistently high work-ethic across the board from everyone that crosses the white line in green each week.\nThis new-look Argyle side will be compact and will stick to their task in and out of possession, with grafters like Callum Wright and Mustapha Bundu likely to be preferred to the enigmatic Cissoko; a player that you don’t know which version you are going to get week on week.\nYou can get the star who tore the Hatters apart at Home Park in one game, and then the liability against Sheffield Wednesday, who could barely track back to help out his defensive line in another, and in their predicament right now, that is not a risk that Muslic, and Argyle, seem to be willing to take.\nRelated\n\"Very close\" - Miron Muslic issues Plymouth Argyle transfer update\nMiron Muslic has provided an Argyle transfer update\nNot only that, but in the current formation, it is hard to see where Cissoko would fit in going forward, with a central striker being flanked by two more central attacking midfielders, rather than the single central outlet and two wide men that Rooney utilised in his time at the club.\nAs a result, the wing-backs are the players to provide the width going forward more often than not, leaving Cissoko very much a square peg trying to force through an ever-decreasing round hole, as his place in the squad looks considerably less likely than at the start of the season.\nWhile a lack of fitness after returning from injury will have played a part, ineffective cameos since the start of the year haven’t helped the Dutchman’s cause when it comes to a recall to the starting lineup, while Morgan Whittaker’s departure also points towards a change intact from the Devon outfit going forward.\nWith Muslic hinting at getting more bodies in the door between now and the transfer deadline, there will be more and more question marks surrounding Cissoko’s future at the club, and it is getting harder and harder to make a case for him in the second-half of the campaign.\nIt is easy to be blinded by the bamboozling footwork that can leave a defender for dead on the odd occasion, and forget the lack of cohesion he adds to a team overall, and right now it is the latter that Argyle need. The flair can wait for now, functionality comes first.\nThere is no denying his ability, and he could well make it at the top level in the future, but for Plymouth Argyle he is the right player at the wrong time, with the out of possession work just as important as what they do with the ball, which is where Cissoko just cannot be trusted.\nYou are only as strong as your weakest link, and if one player doesn’t follow the game plan out of possession, the whole pan comes tumbling down. This is very much a case of team over individual, with the decision on Cissoko’s future likely to define Argyle’s season one way or the other.",

    "text": "ZAPOPAN, Jal; 29 de febrero de 2024.- Fueron 248 niñas, niños, personas mayores o con discapacidad quienes resultaron beneficiados con la entrega gratuita de implementos ortopédicos que entregó el Sistema para el Desarrollo Integral de la Familia (DIF) Zapopan.\nCon esto, el Sistema DIF Zapopan contribuye con el apoyo a quienes lo requieren mediante la entrega de accesorios e implementos ortopédicos, como alternativa para facilitar su vida cotidiana y la de los suyos, alcanzando a más zapopanas y zapopanos, informó el municipio.\nLa directora del Sistema DIF Zapopan, Karla Guillermina Segura Juárez, reiteró el gran trabajo que se hace desde área de Trabajo Social, desde la identificación de casos hasta la entrega de recursos a la población que lo requiere, lo que permite maximizar los recursos a través de trabajo de grandes profesionales quienes atienden a las personas con calidad y calidez.\n«Esta es la primera entrega de 2024, pero no es la primera de la administración y queremos sostener este ritmo de trabajo, queremos cerrar con más entregas, con un compromiso que hacemos desde la administración. La verdad es que ha sido un trabajo muy importante, de valorar hacia dónde van los recursos y en esta administración me permito decirles que hemos duplicado el monto de apoyos, hemos duplicado la cantidad de personas que estamos atendiendo y eso se puede decir fácil, pero detrás de ese multiplicar el presupuesto, es multiplicar el trabajo de la gente que busca y define a dónde van los recursos”.\nPor su parte, la presidenta del Patronato del DIF Zapopan, Michelle Greicha Frangie, destacó el trabajo que realizan las madres, familiares y cuidadores de las personas que dependen de ayuda de terceros para vivir en condiciones dignas, resaltó que la ayuda hoy también es para todas ellas y representa un esfuerzo de todo el equipo DIF, así como de la actual administración.\n“Mientras Karla estaba hablando, yo estaba viendo a estas mamás que cuidan a sus hijos, que están al pendiente, que tienen años seguramente en esta lucha de inclusión, que tienen años buscando cómo sí, cómo echarlos para adelante, cómo lograr que estén hoy mejor que ayer y quiero decirles que mi admiración y mi respeto siempre y que nosotros, como Sistema DIF, lo mínimo que podemos hacer es respaldarles y apoyarles desde donde estamos. Normalmente nos dan mucho las gracias, nosotros decimos: ‘Ese es nuestro trabajo, para eso estamos aquí, para eso es el recurso’”, explicó la presidenta.\nEn esta primera entrega de 2024, y la número seis, en lo que va de la administración actual se recibieron:\n– 51 sillas de ruedas.\n– 660 pañales (12 paquetes de 10 piezas cada uno, en beneficio de 55 personas).\n– 46 aparatos auxiliares auditivos.\n– 23 bastones.\n– 22 andaderas con baño portátil.\n– 52 pares de lentes.\nLa inversión para estos implementos de primera necesidad fue de 364 mil pesos y entre las y los beneficiados están niñas, niños y personas mayores, en total, 248 personas.\nEn Zapopan hay un millón y medio de habitantes de los cuales más de 50 mil tienen alguna discapacidad, por lo que en todos los proyectos del municipio se tiene presente a este grupo poblacional considerando la accesibilidad universal y también se incluye a 170 mil personas adultas mayores, a quienes se atiende con programas con el fin de contribuir para que tengan una vida más digna.",

Самые большие зарплаты обещают газорезчику (до 91,3 тысячи рублей), наладчику холодноштамповочного оборудования (до 83,9 тысячи), крановщику (до 75 тысяч), слесарю-инструментальщику (до 74,8 тысячи) и шлифовщику (до 74,5 тысячи), уточняет портал E1.RU.\nНапомним, в июне в Москве арестовали бывшего владельца «ВСМПО-АВИСМА» Михаила Воеводина. Его обвиняют в мошенничестве в особо крупном размере. По версии следствия, корпорации «ВСМПО-Ависма» был причинен ущерб более 43,6 млн рублей. Он руководил корпорацией с 2009 по 2020 годы.\nМежду прочим, сейчас большинство предприятий, наоборот, снижают зарплаты. Так, на Уральском трубном заводе рабочему отказали в увольнении по соглашению сторон, несмотря на отсутствие заказов. Ещё весной появилась информация о массовых сокращениях на этом заводе. По словам нескольких сотрудников, руководство завода решило избавиться более чем от 500 человек, и более сотни уже остались без работы.",

    "text": "Sans pluie pour faire fonctionner ses barrages, le Costa Rica rationne l’électricitérestrictions climatiques•Pour cause de sécheresse, des coupures d’alimentation électrique s’imposent et se feront par alternance entre les clients 20 Minutes avec AFP Le manque de précipitations qui affecte l’approvisionnement des barrages hydroélectriques au [Costa Rica](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/costa_rica) va obliger à rationner l’électricité la semaine prochaine, ont annoncé jeudi les autorités. « Il s’agit d’une sécheresse que nous n’avons pas connue depuis cinquante ans », a déclaré Berny Fallas, expert en hydroclimatologie à l’Institut costaricien de l’électricité (ICE), le principal fournisseur d’énergie du pays, pointant les effets délétères du phénomène climatique [El Niño](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/el_nino). « Cet El Niño est vraiment le plus compliqué de l’histoire du Costa Rica », a renchéri le directeur d’ICE, Roberto Quiros. Courant alternatif Les coupures commenceront en alternance lundi dans tout le Costa Rica, avec un maximum de trois heures par client. La mesure a été prise pour une durée indéterminée et dépendra des précipitations à venir. La saison des pluies s’étend normalement de mai à novembre. Pour les mêmes raisons de déficit hydrique conséquence d’El Niño, [l’Equateur ](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/equateur)a rationné son électricité pendant plus de deux semaines, avec des coupures allant jusqu’à 13 heures par jour. Le retour des précipitations a permis de lever la mesure en début de semaine. Un dérèglement nommé (en partie) El Niño Le phénomène El Niño et le [ dérèglement climatique](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/rechauffement-climatique) causé par l’homme ont provoqué un nombre record de désastres environnementaux en Amérique latine en 2023, a indiqué mercredi l’Organisation météorologique mondiale (OMM), une agence de l’ [ONU](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/onu/). Quelque 99 % de la production électrique au Costa Rica proviennent de sources renouvelables, mais 75 % sont générés par l’énergie hydroélectrique. Le précédent rationnement d’électricité dans le pays d’Amérique centrale remonte à 2007, également induit par le El Niño, phénomène météorologique naturel associé au réchauffement de la surface des océans dans le Pacifique tropical, qui se produit généralement tous les deux à sept ans et dure entre neuf et douze mois.

    "text": "El presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, afirmó este viernes que la creación de un Estado palestino es viable incluso con el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, en el poder.\nAl ser preguntado si la creación de dos Estados para resolver el conflicto palestino-israelí era “imposible” mientras Netanyahu estuviera en el cargo, Biden respondió: “No, no lo es”.\nAdemás, dijo que Netanyahu no rechaza todas las soluciones de dos Estados y consideró que existen varios tipos de Estados posibles, citando por ejemplo países que son miembros de las Naciones Unidas y no cuentan con Fuerzas Armadas.\n“Hay varios tipos de soluciones de dos Estados (...) Así que creo que hay formas en la que esto podría funcionar”, aseveró.\nEl mandatario estadounidense conversó por teléfono este viernes con Netanyahu, un día después de que este último expresara su oposición a la creación de un Estado palestino como parte de un eventual escenario posconflicto en Gaza.\nBiden fue preguntado por los periodistas sobre si estaría abierto a limitar la ayuda militar que EE.UU. envía a Israel por los comentarios que hizo Netanyahu , ante lo que el presidente respondió: “Creo que podremos llegar a un acuerdo”.\nLa de este viernes fue la primera conversación telefónica entre ambos líderes en casi un mes. Su última llamada fue el 23 de diciembre.\nLa Casa Blanca ha asegurado que la llamada no se produjo por los comentarios que hizo Netanyahu acerca de la creación de un Estado palestino, aunque ha dejado claro que Biden sigue creyendo que el establecimiento de dos Estados es la única solución al conflicto.\nAparte de oponerse a la creación de un Estado palestino , Netanyahu se niega a que la Autoridad Nacional Palestina (ANP), que gobierna algunas partes de la Cisjordania ocupada, retome el control de la Franja de Gaza cuando acabe la ofensiva israelí.\nTanto Biden como la Unión Europea (UE) han reiterado en numerosas ocasiones su respaldo a la solución de dos Estados desde el inicio de la guerra en Gaza y, además, han abogado porque la ANP asuma el control de la Franja cuando acabe el conflicto, después de que fuera expulsada del enclave cuando Hamás le arrebató el poder por la fuerza en 2007.\nIsrael y Hamás llevan en guerra desde el 7 de octubre, cuando un ataque del grupo islamista se saldó con 1.200 muertos y más de 240 rehenes. Tras ello, el Ejército israelí lanzó una fuerte ofensiva sobre Gaza que ha dejado 25.000 fallecidos, muchos de ellos mujeres y niños",
