    "text": "LaVar Ball, the outspoken father of NBA stars Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has reportedly undergone a right foot amputation due to a serious medical issue, according to TMZ Sports .\nDespite the significant health setback, Ball is said to be in “great spirits” and recovering well.\nA Once Larger-Than-Life Personality Now Out of the Spotlight Ball first rose to national fame in 2017 when he made bold and often outrageous claims while promoting his three sons, Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo, as the future of basketball. At the time, he dominated sports headlines, making controversial statements about NBA legends, launching his own Big Baller Brand, and even securing a reality show for the Ball family.\nHis predictions about his sons’ careers weren’t entirely off.\nLonzo Ball was a top-two NBA draft pick and became a key contributor in the league before suffering ongoing knee injuries. LaMelo Ball is now a rising star and an NBA All-Star with the Charlotte Hornets. LiAngelo Ball, though unable to secure a lasting spot in the NBA, has shifted focus to a budding music career.

However, BBB fizzled out after financial struggles and quality concerns.\nAs his sons established themselves in their careers, LaVar gradually stepped out of the media spotlight, which may explain why his recent health issues were not widely known until now.\nLaVar Ball got his foot amputated ? pic.twitter.com/3H7Kvnb9s1\n— LakeShowYo (@LakeShowYo) February 19, 2025 A Quiet Battle, But Still in Good Spirits While details surrounding Ball’s medical condition remain unclear, his positive attitude despite undergoing amputation suggests that he is approaching this challenge with the same bravado he once brought to sports media.\nGiven his history of resilience, it wouldn’t be surprising if LaVar Ball makes a comeback in some capacity—whether in sports, business, or entertainment. For now, however, he appears to be focused on his recovery and family.",

    "text": "A boyfriend was arrested after fleeing from the scene of an alleged attack at the West Village Luxury Apartment Homes in Wildwood. Robert Allie Messina, 31, of Winter Park, was driving an older black Hummer at 3:45 p.m. Wednesday when he was pulled over, according to an arrest report from the Wildwood Police Department. Messina indicated he had been involved in an altercation with his on-again off-again girlfriend of four years. During the altercation, the girlfriend had been able to instruct her Siri iPhone assistant to call her mother. The woman’s mother heard the obvious sounds of a physical struggle and called 911. When police went to the apartment to interview the girlfriend, they found she had lumps on her head and a bruise on her arm. She also said she had been choked by Messina. The girlfriend told police that Messina suffers from Bipolar disorder and had not been taking his medication. Messina was arrested on two counts of battery and booked at the Sumter County Detention Center. Bond was set at $6,000.",

Porém, na avaliação do chefe do Executivo, ainda é cedo para tomar uma decisão, pois ainda não houve condenação de todos. \"Sou favorável à anistia, briguei muito para ter anistia no Brasil. Mas, nesse caso, a gente ainda nem puniu todo mundo, a gente nem descobriu todo mundo, estamos procurando gente, financiador\", disse o presidente em entrevista à Rádio Itatiaia, nesta quinta-feira, 27. Lula afirmou que ainda está em discussão o retorno dos brasileiros envolvidos nos atos golpistas que saíram do Brasil \"para dar a eles a lição que merecem\". \"Quem sabe, o tempinho que ficarem preso, aprendem que a democracia é bom.\" \"Não dá para precipitar essa discussão de anistia. O que temos é terminar de apurar as denúncias do 8 de janeiro\", disse. \"Você pode até ver pessoas que estão presas há muito tempo, anistia é para isso.

    "title": "Gmail Privacy Warning For 2.5 Billion Users—New Email Address Alert",
    "text": "The question of who a given Gmail address really belongs to, and where the email sent to it goes, is something of a perennial problem for users of Google’s insanely popular email platform. With around 2.5 billion active accounts, according to Google itself, it should come as no surprise that this privacy issue crops up time and time again in official Gmail support forums. While the issue surrounding receiving emails intended for another Gmail user is concerning, it’s also relatively easy to explain. A new leak, however, appears like it could complicate matters of email addressing further at first glance—but it would be a privacy blessing, not nightmare, if true. Here’s what we know.\nForbes Google’s Gmail And Photos Deletion Warning As 1-Year Timer Expires By Davey Winder No, You Do Not Have The Same Email Address As Another Gmail User At the risk of sounding like a broken record, if that idiom still means anything in the streaming music era, dots do not matter in Gmail email addresses . All the pleas for help that you read in the assorted Gmail support forums claiming that someone else has the same email address as them and they are getting their messages, or worrying that the same is happening but in reverse, can be explained by Google’s Gmail dotted address policy. “If anyone tries to create a Gmail account with a dotted version of your username,” Google said , “they'll get an error saying the username is already taken.” If, however, someone uses a dotted version of your Gmail address when completing an online form, newsletter subscription etc, then you will get the emails sent as a result.\nIf your email is johnsmith@gmail.com then email sent to john.smith@gmail.com, jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com and j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com will all come to you. Things go wrong either by accident, a simple typo, or intent when someone is trying to be clever in keeping tabs on incoming email linked to addresses provided, but failing. “If someone meant to email john.43.smith@gmail.com but typed john.smith@gmail.com, the message went to you because you own johnsmith@gmail.com,” Google said. In other words, if you own smith@gmail.com that doesn’t mean that email sent to john.smith@gmail.com or jenny.smith@gmail.com will also come to you.\nForbes Gmail Explicit Content Warning As X-Rated Email Hits Users By Davey Winder Trump’s Cabinet: Here Are His Picks For Key Roles—RFK Jr, Doug Burgum, Matt Gaetz And More What Time Is Netflix’s Live Jake Paul Vs. Mike Tyson Fight On Friday? NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Friday, November 15th New Email Addressing Leak Suggests An Even More Privacy-Centric Gmail Service Could Be Heading Your Way A newly revealed leak published Nov. 15 by Android Authority , suggests that a new email alias function could be heading to Gmail, which could add a new privacy-centric twist to the whole email addressing debate. As part of a coding teardown, investigative reporters discovered some code that suggests Google is working on an email forwarding system using aliases, similar to Apple’s Hide My Email that provides an automated random email address creator to help keep your personal email address private when subscribing to services.\nThe Google system appears to be called Shielded Email, according to Android Authority, which found an Android settings menu within Google Autofill after closely examining the application package “APK” code for a new Google Play Services release. Heading there does nothing as of yet, but it does show that Google has something up its sleeve that could appeal to privacy-focused Gmail users . The idea of a single-use, disposable, email address for Gmail users is certainly one that will, I am sure, be welcomed. It’s been something of a game-changer in the iPhone world, after all. I use it all the time when I am in Apple-mode.\nI have reached out to Google my Gmail contact there for a statement and will update this article in due course.\nForbes Gmail Users Beware—Link Hovering Attacks On The Up By Davey Winder",

    "text": "MADRID 24 Oct. (EUROPA PRESS) - El expresidente de Estados Unidos Donald Trump ha asegurado este jueves que en caso de ganar las elecciones presidenciales del 5 de noviembre despediría \"ensegundos\" al fiscal especial Jack Smith, quien lidera el caso federal en su contra por intentar revocar el resultado de las elecciones de 2020. Sus declaraciones se han producido en el marco de una entrevista con el locutor de radio conservador Hugh Hewitt, que le ha preguntado si priorizaría perdonarse a sí mismo en los casos judiciales que tiene abiertos en su contra frente a despedir a Smith. \"Esmuyfácil:ledespediríaendossegundos\", ha asegurado Trump, agregando que no habría problemas puesto que cuenta con \"inmunidad\", en alusión a la decisión emitida por el Tribunal Supremo a principios de julio, que determinó que gozaba de privilegios presidenciales relativos durante su tiempo al frente de la Casa Blanca. En respuesta a estas declaraciones, la campaña de la vicepresidenta estadounidense Kamala Harris ha indicado en un comunicado que el magnate piensa que está \"porencimadelaley\". \"EstosúltimoscomentariosestánenlíneaconlasadvertenciashechasporelexjefedegabinetedeTrumpdequequieregobernarcomoundictadorconpodersincontrol\", ha agregado, según The Hill. Smith fue nombrado en noviembre de 2022 por el fiscal general, Merrick Garland, para investigar el manejo de documentos clasificados por parte de Trump, así como sus esfuerzos por subvertir los resultados de las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 en el periodo previo al asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021. En otro punto de la entrevista, el locutor radiofónico Hewitt ha preguntado sobre los \"ataques\" de países europeos a empresas estadounidenses como Apple y Google, a lo que el expresidente ha respondido que la UE \"esunamini-China\". \"Nosonnuestrosamigos.¿Creéisquesonnuestrosamigos?DejadmedecirosquesoncasitanduroscomoChina\", ha subrayado, criticando la relación comercial del bloque europeo con Estados Unidos y asegurando que la UE trata a Washington \"muymal\".",

    "title": "Maritime Corridor To Gaza Could Start This Weekend, Says EU Chief",
    "text": "A sea corridor to take desperately needed aid from Cyprus to besieged Palestinians in Gaza could start this weekend, the European Union said on Friday. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that a temporary port would be built in Gaza to facilitate a flow of aid by sea, initially from Cyprus. \"We are now very close to opening this corridor, hopefully this Saturday-Sunday, and I'm very glad to see an initial pilot operation will be launched today,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the Cypriot port town of Larnaca, alongside Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides. A shipment of food was due to be dispatched by the charity World Central Kitchen from Cyprus on Friday, with support from the United Arab Emirates. The quantities of aid envisaged and the distribution logistics in Gaza were not immediately clear. Gaza has been under an Israeli naval blockade since 2007, when the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas seized control. A joint communique signed off by the EU, the U.S., Britain, the UAE and a number of European countries said: \"The delivery of humanitarian assistance directly to Gaza by sea will be complex, and our nations will continue to assess and adjust our efforts to ensure we deliver aid as effectively as possible. \"This maritime corridor can - and must - be part of a sustained effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid and commercial commodities into Gaza through all possible routes. We will continue to work with Israel to expand deliveries by land, insisting that it facilitate more routes and open additional crossings to get more aid to more people.\" Cyprus is the closest EU member state to Gaza, some 370 km (230 miles) away. It has lobbied for months to launch the corridor, but faced challenges ranging from the lack of port infrastructure in Gaza to security issues. \"The maritime corridor can make a real difference ... but, in parallel, our efforts to provide assistance to Palestinians through all possible routes of course will continue,\" Von der Leyen said. The United Nations has said at least 576,000 people in Gaza - one quarter of its population - are on the brink of famine. EU member states, the UAE, the United States and other partners are working together on the project, Von der Leyen said, singling out Christodoulides and UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for their commitment. \"As the EU member at the heart of the region, Cyprus bears a moral duty to do its utmost ... leveraging its role and excellent relations with all countries in the region,\" Christodoulides said. Under the arrangement, cargo would undergo security inspections on Cyprus, by a team including Israeli officials. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Cyprus tested an on-island screening mechanism in January, when British and Cypriot aid for Gaza was dispatched to Egypt.

    "text": "La comarca de Vigo perderá 4.000 autonómos en dos años por jubilación\nAutoempleo\nLa Unión de Profesionales y Trabajadores Autónomos propone “que convivan los que se retiran con gente joven para transferir el conocimiento\" ante la falta de relevo\nUno de cada cinco autónomos en la comarca de Vigo está a punto de jubilarse. Son unas 4.000 personas que trabajan por cuenta propia las que se retirarán del mercado laboral en dos años en el área viguesa, más de 10.000 en Galicia y 600.000 en toda España, según calcula la Unión de Profesionales y Trabajadores Autónomos (Upta). “Nos enfrentamos a un grave problema en muy poco tiempo. Vigo es punta de lanza de autoempleo, pero también de la próxima destrucción masiva de autónomos\", indica Eduardo Abad, presidente de Upta, que hace un llamamiento a las administraciones para que “remen en la misma dirección\".\nLa patronal presentó ante las diferentes comunidades -también a Galicia- un paquete de medidas entre las que propone un plan de relevo generacional con una tarifa plana invertida; es decir, que haya incentivos económicos no solo para los emprendedores “sino también para los que se jubilan y contraten a jóvenes los dos últimos años como una fórmula para poder transferir el conocimiento”. “No hay tasa de reposición, especialmente en oficios tradicionales”, apunta. Upta también plantea que a través de la FP Dual se permita a los jóvenes realizar prácticas en establecimientos de los pequeños autónomos\".\nLa cara amable la pone la creación de empleo entre los autónomos, especialmente en la comarca de Vigo donde se crearon más de un centenar en el último año, el 70% de la provincia, mientras que Galicia perdió cerca de un millar, según los últimos datos disponibles de la Seguridad Social\nA cierre del mes de febrero, el área viguesa tenía afiliados al RETA un total de 27.290 trabajadores por cuenta propia, de los que 18.300 corresponden a la ciudad viguesa, seguida de Redondela, Nigrán y O Porriño entre los municipios con mayor autoempleo. Por sectores, el grueso de estos negocios son de construcción, comercio, hostelería y transporte y cada vez se integran más profesionales cualificados. “Detectamos una mayor calidad en el empleo autónomo, irrumpen profesionales altamente cualificados”, explica el presidente de Upta España, que valora de manera muy positiva este cambio que se está produciendo en el mercado laboral.\nContenido patrocinado",
