    "text": "This year saw the most cases of pneumonia among children in the past five years. If in other summers a few children with such pathology would come to the hospital, now their number has increased by 30 percent. Doctors are warning that hospitals are full, and this is because many children are returning from holidays after being exposed to various viruses that are dangerous for immunity.\nTen days ago, Viorica Spânu with her daughter Patricia took the bus from Milan to return to the Republic of Moldova. The next day, Patricia had a fever, and as soon as they reached the Râscani area, they went to the doctor. For several days, mother and daughter were admitted to the hospital, as the teenager was diagnosed with pneumonia.\nFor many children, the first day was the most difficult, with a very high fever.\nDoctors say that the little ones are the most vulnerable to pneumonia, especially children from one to eight years old.\nRODICA OVCEARENCO, head, intensive care, Municipal Children’s Hospital number 1: “Even if it is summer and the children are not in groups now, but the children with their parents are resting abroad, they have contact with children from other regions, and this is probably the reason why many viruses and bacteria are known.”\nALIONA ROTARI, director, Municipal Children’s Hospital No. 1: “Pneumonia is a real pathology and when a doctor’s help is needed, I would ask parents not to hesitate to call 112. It is true that in the five years we have not registered a greater number of patients were sent to the emergency department. In the last period we have more serious and severe pneumonia than in previous years.”\nExperts recommend parents to contact the family doctor about the first symptoms of the child’s illness and not to use self-medication. At the same time, doctors are urging parents to vaccinate their children against the flu.\n2024-08-15 17:14:00\n#Children #increasingly #affected #pneumonia",

    "title": "ISU men's and women's basketball teams score wins against Vandals",
    "text": "The beginning wasn’t pretty, and the ending was downright scary, but there was enough good stuff in between to allow the Idaho State men’s basketball team to escape with a 64-59 win over instate rival Idaho at Reed Gym Thursday night.\n“Honestly, I didn’t feel good about our first four minutes and our last four minutes,” said ISU Coach Ryan Looney, “but everything else in between there was pretty good.”\nThe Bengals played poor defense and got in early foul trouble early in the contest, allowing the Vandals to build a 27-20 lead with 4:30 to in the half. ISU had three players, all of whom play the small forward position, in foul trouble with two fouls each n the period, the Vandals were a perfect seven for seven from the foul line, and Looney got hit with a technical foul for protesting too vigorously.\nYet ISU was able to go on an 8-3 run to close the halftime margin to 30-28, and re-establish some footing heading into the second period.\n“We had some big-time foul trouble, especially early in the game,” said Looney, noting that Isaiah Griffin, Trent Johnson and Briggs Ranstrom all had two fouls in the first half. “We just literally had to get through some minutes to get to halftime, so we could get our regular lineup back on the floor.”\nOnce they did, the Bengals went on a 14-0 run in the second half to build as much as a 17-point lead with 5:42 to play in the game. Maleek Arington was dispensing his usual magic at point guard, center Brayden Parker got hot at the free throw line, and Miguel Tomley and Kiree Huie joined the offensive parade.\n“At the end of the day, Maleek Arington is becoming a really good point guard,” said Looney, after the sophomore from Auburn, Wash. finished the night with 14 points, six rebounds, four assists and no turnovers while playing all 40 minutes. “We have nine turnovers in the last 80 minutes of basketball, and a lot of that has to do with him.\n“And I think everyone in our program has confidence that Maleek can guard the other team’s best player every team we play as well,” Looney added. “Those two things are giving us a chance in every game we play now.”\nUnfortunately, the Bengals reverted to sloppy late-game habits that allowed the Vandals to make the game much closer than it needed to be. One play in particular was disconcerting. With 23 seconds left and ISU up 62-54, the Bengals inbounded the ball against pressure, getting the ball in the front court to Trent Johnson. Instead of backing the ball out and waiting to get fouled, however, Johnson tried to make a spectacular dunk. He missed and came crashing down, clutching his knee at the end of the play. He later hobbled off the court at the end of the game, limping but under his own power.\n“That’s one of the mistakes we made at the end of the game,” Looney said. “We executed an inbounds play against pressure perfectly, we just needed to pull it out, get fouled, make some free throws and the\ngame would have been over right there. And then shortly after that, we blew a coverage on defense and gave them a wide-open three-pointer. Those two plays make the game a lot closer than it should have been.”\nBut the Bengals managed to hang on to claim their seventh straight win against the Vandals. Coupled with the ISU’s women’s win in Moscow Thursday night, it guaranteed that the King Spud Trophy, which goes to the school that wins the most men’s and women’s games in the ISU-Idaho rivalry each season, will remain in Pocatello. Since the Bengals won it last year, the worst they can do is split the four-game set this year, meaning the trophy will stay in Pocatello for another year.\nThe Bengals had three players beside Arington score in double figures, led by Parker with 18, including 10 of 13 from the foul line. He added eight rebounds, an assist, a steal, three blocked shots and did not commit a turnover. Huie had 12 points, four rebounds and three blocks, and Tomley had 12 points.\nGuard Quinn Denker led Idaho with 14 points, all in the second half, forward Tyler Linhardt added 13 and Julius Mims 12.\nThe Bengals improved to 2-3 in conference play, 7-11 overall, while Idaho fell to 1-3 in the league, 7-10 overall. ISU hosts defending league champion Eastern Washington, who beat Weber State in Ogden, 80-78 Thursday night, at 6 p.m. Saturday in Reed Gym.\nWomen’s Basketball: Idaho State 61, Idaho 56\nThe Idaho State women won their third Big Sky Conference game in a row, and their first on the road with a rivalry win in Moscow Thursday night.\nThe Bengals put four players in double figure scoring, led by true freshman forward Piper Carlson and guard Maria Dias, who both had 12 points off the bench. Starters Tasia Jordan and Nicka Lokica had 10 points apiece, with Jordan adding seven rebounds and Lokica five rebounds, two blocks and two steals.\n“The game lived up to how a rivalry game should be,” said ISU Coach Seton Sobolewski. “Hard fought on both ends.”\nIdaho State led 19-13 at the end of one quarter, 34-28 at half and 52-44 at the end of three periods. The Vandals outscored ISU 12-9 in the final quarter, as ISU went cold, hitting just two of ten shots in the final quarter, to narrow the final margin.\nCarlson has put together back-to-back solid performances off the bench, having scored 13 points and not missing a shot in ISU’s win over Sacramento State on Saturday. She has totaled 25 points on 11 of 13 shooting and seven steals in the last two games.\n“Piper has made huge strides the last two games,” Sobolewski said. “So fun to watch her develop.”\nThe Bengals played without forward Halle Wright, who fell ill on the trip. She practiced Wednesday night, but then got sick on game day. It’s unknown if she’ll be available for ISU’s game at Eastern Washington Saturday afternoon. Tip-off is 3 p.m. MT.\nThe Bengals hit five of ten three-pointers, one of their better efforts from beyond the arc on the season, including two of four by Lokica, who hit four of six from distance in the win Saturday over Sac State. ISU also had only 13 turnovers on the night, one of their better efforts in that category.\nSarah Brans led Idaho with 16 points, including four three-pointers, and Asha Phillips added 12 points. The Vandals outrebounded ISU, 41-35.\nWith the win, ISU moves to 3-2 in the Big Sky, 7-9 overall. Idaho falls to 2-2 in league, 9-7 overall.",

    "text": "Un reconocida actriz que ha participado en producciones tanto de Televisa, como de TV Azteca y hasta de Netflix dio a conocer a través de sus redes sociales que sufrió un preinfarto, por lo que se internó en el hospital. Cabe destacar que esta estrella de televisión se encuentra desahuciada por el cáncer de columna que padece.\nRenata el Castillo reveló en febrero de 2023 que fue diagnosticada con un tumor en la columna. De esta manera, se realizó una cirugía para eliminar el tumor que costó 250 mil pesos, dinero que consiguió gracias a las donaciones de sus colegas del medio artístico y sus amigos cercanos.\nPUBLICIDAD\nNo obstante, en julio de 2024 confesó que el tratamiento y las radioterapias que estaba recibiendo no funcionaron, por lo que el cáncer se expandió a otras áreas y ya no hay nada qué hacer al respecto. Cabe destacar que la enfermedad de la actriz de ‘Como dice el dicho’ se derivó de un cáncer cervicouterino que no fue diagnosticado a tiempo, ya que no se hizo el papanicolau durante el año que duró la pandemia por Covid-19.\n¿Qué le pasó a Renata del Castillo, actriz de Televisa?\nA través de sus historias de Instagram la actriz de ‘Control Z’ reveló que llegó en al hospital por un intenso dolor: “Estoy en el hospital en urgencias porque traigo un dolor desde ayer súper intenso en los omóplatos y ya se pasó a mi brazo”.\n“La oncóloga me dijo hace rato que me viniera ya por la inmunoterapia, que por fin la recibí el martes, puede ser una trombosis porque se hacen coágulos por todos los medicamentos que me ponen”, agregó.\nDe esta manera, mencionó haber sufrido un preinfarto, por lo que pidió a sus seguidores que oraran por ella: “Tuve un preinfarto, así que me van a hacer todos los análisis pidiéndole a Dios que todo salga bien, oren por mí y aquí estamos, internados en el hospital”.",

    "title": "Fishing communities welcome B.C. intention to reform licensing and quotas | Canada's National Observer: Climate News",
    "text": "Fishing communities, harvesters and advocates are welcoming British Columbia’s intention to work with the federal government to reform the purchase system for fish licences and quotas for B.C.'s commercial fishing industry.\nAs part of the Coastal Marine Strategy unveiled last week, the province says it’s moving toward an owner-operator system for quota and licences. Under the new system, licence and quota holders would also need to be active fish harvesters — something advocacy groups and First Nations have been requesting for years.\nGet daily news from Canada's National Observer Email *\nThe current individual transferable quotas (ITQ) system allows corporations and foreign investors with deep pockets to buy the right to catch fish for the highest price, making it increasingly difficult for individual harvesters, First Nations and generational fishing families to stay in the industry.\nA transition to an owner-operator system would aim to eliminate the ability of a few giants to stake a majority claim on B.C.'s fishing grounds. One company alone, Jim Pattison’s Canfisco, owns double-digit percentages of some fish quotas, worth tens of millions of dollars.\nAn owner-operator system is not a novel concept in the country. Atlantic Canada has had one in place for years, and as a result, has lower costs compared to B.C.\nFishing community welcomes B.C. intention to move toward an owner-operator system\nB.C. Premier David Eby sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in May advocating for a policy change, as the decision to bring B.C. in line with the East Coast is ultimately in the hands of the federal government. However, there is no word yet on when B.C. fishers can expect a decision.\n“The province stepping in and pressuring the federal government for change is incredibly impactful,” wrote James Lawson, president of the United Fisherman & Allied Workers Union in a statement.\n“The province is ultimately responsible for labour and recognize that if policies don’t change they may have to deal with the fallout from a skilled labour shortage very soon.”\nThis issue in the Pacific is akin to the housing crisis, says Sonia Strobel, co-founder and CEO of Skipper Otto , a Vancouver-based, community-supported fishery that works with 45 fishing families to sell wild-caught seafood directly to consumers.\n“Real estate is a really good parallel because we've been well aware for many years that when we don't have things in place… what happens is purchasing homes [or] condos for investment drives up the price of properties,” she says. “And then that really pushes local people out of the market [and] makes it next to impossible for young people to buy their first home.”\nSonia is seeing the same thing happen with fishing families and First Nations being pushed out of the industry.\nIn 2021, the Haida and eight coastal First Nations were able to purchase licences and quotas from willing third-party licence-holders, thanks to an agreement between nations and the federal government in an effort to address the dwindling number of Indigenous community members who were able to make a living fishing in their traditional waters.\n“I've watched the industry kind of disappear from this area,” says Trevor Russ, director of policy and programs for Coastal First Nations . “A lot of the marine resources that are commercially harvested and go to market are still harvested around Haida Gwaii but [there’s] very little commercial fishery participation from our communities here.”\nLicences and quotas can be leased by the owner, but just like housing rentals, as the price of a licence goes up, so does the cost to lease, leaving many fishers in a position where they need to work extraordinarily hard not fall into the red, which has become increasingly common.\n“There's not going to be a next generation unless they can go in on an owner-operator system,” says Shaun Strobel, Sonia’s husband and Skipper Otto’s lead fisher.\n“I know people that have leased quota from a company… and by the time they’ve fixed their boat and got ready to go, the price of the fish had dropped to the point that they had to go and fish at a loss.”\nEmily Orr, executive director for the T Buck Suzuki Foundation , grew up in a fishing family and fished for 12 years under her father’s licence, and skippered the boat when he semi-retired. Despite her years of experience, she wasn't in a position to take on the financial risk of about $700,000 for both the vessel and licence.\nShaun was also unable to buy his father's vessel and licences due to cost constraints. Instead, he transitioned to gillnetting, which is not part of the same ITQ system.\nTasha Sutcliffe, senior fisheries advisor with Ecotrust Canada , says anecdotes like this illustrate how difficult it is to compete in the market under the current system, and that buying a licence and quota in most fisheries is completely out of reach for the average fish harvester.\nEcotrust Canada has been working and advocating for a policy shift to an owner-operator system in B.C. since before Sutcliffe started working there in 2007. Over the years, she says the problem has only gotten worse, and there are risks in switching to an owner-operator system without a lot of input from fishers and their communities.\nA successful owner-operator roll-out would identify fisheries where the system would make the most sense. She would also like to see a “fleet separation” policy that would prevent anyone from owning fish quota if they are not themselves fishing.\nSonia is optimistic the Coastal Marine Strategy recognizes the need for the government to play a role in putting infrastructure in place to encourage thriving fisheries. It represents a move away from a corporate focus, but it needs to be a plan tailored for B.C.\n“You can't simply cut and paste Atlantic province policies in British Columbia and hope that we'll get the same results,” Sonia says.",

Alguns a chamam de Galáxia da Moeda de Prata devido à aparência que tem quando é observada com pequenos telescópios\n; enquanto isso, outros a conhecem como Galáxia do Escultor.\n-\nGaláxia quase invisível desafia modelo mais aceito de matéria escura\n-\nO que é uma galáxia e quais são os tipos que já conhecemos?\nFoi em 1783 que Caroline Herschel, matemática e astrônoma, descobriu a galáxia. Localizada nos limites da constelação do Escultor, NGC 253 fica a cerca de 10 milhões de anos-luz de nós e se estende por quase 70 mil anos-luz. As dimensões são impressionantes, mas há galáxias espirais ainda maiores — é o caso de NGC 6872, que mede incríveis 522 mil anos-luz.\nEla é o maior membro do Grupo de Galáxias do Escultor, o mais próximo do Grupo Local. Trata-se do nosso grupo galáctico, no qual a Via Láctea e Andrômeda são os membros mais massivos e, por isso, dominantes.\n-\nCT no Flipboard\n: você já pode assinar gratuitamente as revistas Canaltech no Flipboard do iOS e Android e acompanhar todas as notícias em seu agregador de notícias favorito.\n-\nNa foto, NGC 253 aparece com sua estrutura espiral repleta de faixas de poeira — algumas, inclusive, parecem sair do seu disco galáctico ocupado por regiões de formação estelar e estrelas jovens. Ainda, NGC 253 é uma forte emissora de raios X e gama, provavelmente vindos de\nburacos negros\nmassivos.\nGaláxias espirais\nComo a foto mostra, NGC 253 é uma galáxia do tipo espiral, categoria que inclui a Via Láctea e a maioria das galáxias conhecidas. A maior parte delas é formada por um bojo central cercado por um disco estelar achatado e em rotação.\nO bojo é o lar e estrelas mais antigas e escuras, que orbitam o buraco negro supermassivo da galáxia. Cerca de 70% daquelas do tipo espiral têm estrelas organizadas em uma espécie de barra partindo do centro galáctico.\nAinda não se sabe exatamente como os braços espirais destas galáxias foram formados, mas uma possibilidade é que tenham nascido do movimento de ondas pelo disco externo delas, ou talvez por\nencontros com outras galáxias\n. Conforme evoluem, a tendência é que as galáxias espirais eventualmente se tornem elípticas.\nLeia a matéria no\nCanaltech\n.\nTrending no Canaltech:\n-\nPor que as montadoras de carros voltaram investir tanto no Brasil?\n-\nOs 45 filmes mais esperados de 2024\n-\nGodzilla e Kong | Novo trailer aposta na galhofa e no absurdo\n-\nTubarão pré-histórico com \"dentes de vampiro\" é achado nos EUA\n-\nMegaestrutura submersa da Idade da Pedra é descoberta na Alemanha\n-\nFalhas mostram que placa tectônica do Pacífico está rachando",

    "title": "La insólita frase de la ministra de Deportes francesa sobre el escándalo en Argentina-Marruecos: “Una travesura”",
    "text": "La polémica por el escándalo ocurrido en el partido entre Argentina y Marruecos por los Juegos Olímpicos sigue escalando. AFA reclamó ante FIFA, que ya inició una investigación. Pero para la ministra de Deportes de Francia, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, el episodio no fue tan dramático. “Hubo una pequeña intrusión que no debería haber ocurrido, pero que fue bastante bondadosa por parte de los seguidores marroquíes. Luego se entrelazó con un largo tiempo de descuento en el que hubo un poco de dilación en cuanto al arbitraje”, sostuvo Oudéa-Castéra, en una entrevista. Además, garantizó que nada similar volverá a ocurrir, y que el duelo entre Ucrania y Marruecos del próximo sábado, en el mismo estadio, se llevará adelante con total tranquilidad. “Se llevó a cabo una reunión entre el Comité Olímpico Internacional y la FIFA, todo volverá a la normalidad. Todo será perfecto en el partido del próximo sábado entre Ucrania y Marruecos. Estoy comprometida con esto”, aseguró. Oudéa-Castéra ya había tenido palabras polémicas en relación a Argentina al hablar de los festejos tras ganar el Mundial de Qatar. “HUbo un contraste muy fuerte entre los (jugadores) franceses, que perdieron con elegancia, y los comportamientos fuera de lugar y a veces muy desagradables de los argentinos”, había dicho en ese momento, tratando de “penosos”, “indignos” y “vulgares”. La FIFA anunció que hará una investigación por lo sucedido entre la Sub-23 y Marruecos, en los Juegos Olímpicos La FIFA anunció este jueves que comenzará una investigación para evaluar posibles violaciones de las normas después de los graves incidentes ocurridos el miércoles durante el partido entre Argentina y Marruecos en el torneo de fútbol de los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024. \"La Comisión Disciplinaria de la FIFA ha decidido, en virtud del artículo 36 del Código Disciplinario de la FIFA, nombrar a un experto en integridad para que preste su ayuda en investigaciones sobre posibles contravenciones de la reglamentación de la FIFA, tras los incidentes acaecidos durante el partido entre las selecciones de Argentina y Marruecos disputado el 24 de julio de 2024 en el Estadio Geoffroy-Guichard de Saint-Etienne (Francia), correspondiente a la fase de grupos del Torneo Olímpico de Fútbol Masculino París 2024. La FIFA publicará más información sobre el resultado de dichas investigaciones a su debido tiempo\", se puede leer en el comunicado de la entidad presidida por Gianni Infantino en su página oficial. La FIFA decidió proceder con la queja presentada por la AFA, (respaldada por el COA), tras la derrota de Argentina contra Marruecos en su debut en los Juegos Olímpicos. Claudio Tapia y su equipo buscan que se les otorgue la victoria debido a los disturbios causados por los hinchas marroquíes. El artículo 36 del Código Disciplinario determina que \"la secretaría podrá nombrar a un experto en integridad para que preste su ayuda en investigaciones sobre posibles contravenciones de la reglamentación de la FIFA cuando sea necesario\". En su inciso 2 indica que \"el experto en integridad podrá solicitar la apertura de procedimientos disciplinarios y proponer la imposición de medidas disciplinarias a federaciones miembro, clubes y particulares\". Además, también aclara: \"El experto en integridad deberá ser imparcial en todo momento y cumplir con los requisitos de independencia definidos en el Reglamento de gobernanza de la FIFA. Los requisitos y condiciones de su nombramiento, así como de su cargo, se fijarán conforme a la circular al respecto\".",
