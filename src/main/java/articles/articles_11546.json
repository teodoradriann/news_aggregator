    "text": "Jay Leno gave an emotional update about his wife, Mavis, and revealed how they get through the days when she is ‘a bit down’ in the midst of her struggle with dementia.\nThe TV personality, 74 – which was recently seen as bruising after his fall of a hill – People In an article published on Thursday, he tries to find ‘the humor’ and ‘fun’ and ‘have fun’ despite her condition.\nLast year in April, the former Tonight Show -Guestheer was granted the conservatory of Mavis after a court revealed that she recognizes ‘sometimes not him’ and does not remember her own date of birth.\nWhile promoting his latest project, Midas Man, Leno expressed the outlet that he still wants to find ‘your moments when you can laugh and have fun. You try to find the humor in this situation. ‘\n‘I took my wife shopping, I can see that she is a bit down, [so I said]”Come on, we’re going to the shopping center.”\nJay remembered: “So we go to Nordstrom’s and I said,” Do you see something that you like? ” “No, no.” So we look at the shoes, and [she says]”Oh, I love these sneakers.” ‘\nJay Leno, 74, gave a moving update about his wife, Mavis, a year after it was revealed that dementia was diagnosed with her; seen earlier this month in West Hollywood\nThe star explained that Mavis saw a few ‘Bright Blue Sneakers’ and he told her that she had to find a second pair of shoes that she also liked.\nShe soon came across red and white -colored sneakers in the mall. “So I see she is happy and I said,” This is great. ” So I got two pairs of sneakers, and [the cashier says] “That’s $ 24. And the other pair, that’s $ 847.” ‘\n“I’m going:” No, I only had two pairs of sneakers. I thought this was $ 24. ‘ [The cashier] says: “Yes, these are $ 24. But the other were [designer sneakers]. “”\nLeno added: “It seemed that the man took a few of the same sneakers and used a Bedazzler on them, and they were $ 800. I look at my wife and said:” Do you like this? ” I am going: “Honey, you look great.” ‘\nJay then said to people: ‘It’s fine, I’m glad I can afford this and it made my wife happy. It just made me laugh. Simply typical. I thought the pair of $ 24 looked better than that, but that’s okay. ‘\n‘It just made me laugh, and I think if you are dealing with things like this, you will find your moments when you can laugh and have fun, and my wife really likes them and felt good about it. ‘\nLeno said jokes: ‘So the fact that it was the same pair of sneakers who was hit with a Bedazzler, I think that’s fine. But it just made me laugh, and that’s almost what it is. ‘\nIn January last year, it was revealed that his wife Mavis was diagnosed with ‘advanced dementia’, although it is not known when she received the health diagnosis.\nLast year in April, the former Tonight Show -Guestheer received a conservatory from Mavis, after a court revealed that she “sometimes doesn’t” recognize him “; Seen in April 2024 in LA\n‘It just made me laugh, and I think if you are dealing with things like this, you will find your moments when you can laugh and have fun, and my wife really likes them and felt good about it, “He said; Seen in 1989 in Westwood\nAnd in April 2024, Leno received the conservatory of his wife – with whom he made the decision in 1980.\nLater that same month, Mavis gave an update about her condition when she accompanied her husband to the premiere of Unfrosted in Los Angeles.\nDuring an interview with Entertainment tonight She said positively: “I feel great, yes!”\nJay added: ‘I thought I would come for something nice for a change. Everything is so controversial. Just to come to a funny, foolish movie – it’s great. I think people will have a great time. ‘\n‘Well, we hang around every day. We have a great time. 44 years! So we’re doing well, “the TV personality has also shared.\nAt the time, Leno had just turned 74, but admitted to the outlet that he was not a ‘big birthday man’.\nMavis also cut in to say while she leaned her head on her husband: ‘We neither of them [are]! We just have each other. ‘\nThe following month Leno became emotional when he became candid about the care of his wife when the couple attended the 16th annual Global Women’s Rights Awards & Gala of the feminist Majority Foundation.\n‘Well, we hang around every day. We have a great time. 44 years! So we are doing well, “the TV personality has also shared; Seen in 2023 in El Segundo\nHe told Fox News “We have been married for 44 years. It becomes easier. It doesn’t get any more difficult. We do everything together. I go home every night, make a dinner and sit around. We enjoy each other’s company. ‘\nThe couple also got on stage during the ceremony and Jay Gutste Lief that marrying Mavis ‘the smartest thing I have ever done’.\n“We have a lot of fun. People say that marriage is difficult. I don’t get it. I enjoy her company. I like to take care of her. We have fun. ‘\n“She is the most independent woman I ever knew. Again, I just couldn’t be more proud of her, “added Leno to the philanthropist. “I am part of her legacy and I am proud of that.”\nAnd in July last year, Jay and Mavis were seen together enjoying a ride by Los Angeles.\nThe couple also stepped on stage during the ceremony and Jay Gutste Lief that marrying Mavis ‘the smartest I have ever done’; Seen in 2023 in LA\nLeno is also recovering\nLeno also recovered after he had suffered a few months earlier in November 2024 on a nasty fall of a hill of 60 ft.\nThe accident resulted in the former talk show host that got a large bruise on the left side of his face, a black eye and also a broken wrist.\nIn January 2023, Jay was involved in a motorcycle accident where he was ‘was covered’ and a number of injuries became, such as a broken collarbone and two broken ribs.\nJust a few months before the crash, Jay suffered a previously devastating accident when a steam engine from a vintage car on which he had worked in his face.",

El argentino fue titular en el clásico ante Sporting Lisboa, de visitante, en el partido de ida por la semifinal de la Copa de Portugal. Fue derrota 2 a 1, pero con el resultado abierto para la revancha. El Sporting ganaba 1 a 0 con gol de Goncalves de cabeza, en una jugada en la que Nico Otamendi no tuvo responsabilidad porque el rival cabeceó lejos de su zona de marcación. En el segundo tiempo, Gyokeres puso el 2 a 0 de los Leones. Entonces, el Fideo empezó a tener mayor protagonismo. Angelito tiró el centro del descuento de Aursnes. El equipo de Schmitd fue con continuidad por el empate y lo festejó con una muy buena definición del argentino tras un pase atrás. Sin embargo, el referí anuló tras consulta con el VAR por una interferencia de Casper Tengstedt al arquero uruguayo Franco Israel. La asistencia de Di María Angel DI María - 29-2-2024 La asistencia de Di María El gol anulado a Di María Angel DI María - 29-2-2024 El gol anulado a Di María por VAR Otra realidad es que, más allá del buen aporte de Di María, el Sporting Lisboa fue un justo vencedor, ya que marcó claras diferencias en el juego, sobre todo durante el primer tiempo y el arranque del segundo. Perder por un gol le deja al Benfica la chance abierta para la revancha, el 3 de abril, ya en el estadio de las Águilas. Para Angelito ya son nueve asistencias en 35 partidos en su segunda etapa en el Benfica. Está enchufado: venía de convertir un gol en el 4 a 0 al Portimonense, por la Liga. Antes de su regreso a Rosario Central, previsto para mitad de año tras la Copa América, tiene un objetivo: el doblete en Portugal, ya que el equipo es líder, con dos unidades de ventaja sobre el Sporting, en el torneo local. En la otra semi, Porto le ganó 2-1 a Santa Clara de visitante. Alan Varela jugó los 90' y Marcos Díaz atajó para el local.",

    "title": "NIST Reveals 98 Ways Your Hardware Can Be Hacked",
    "text": "The chips inside our devices harbor 98 different ways they can be hacked. And unlike software vulnerabilities that can be patched with a quick update, these flaws are literally carved into silicon.\nPeter Mell and Irena Bojanova, researchers at the National Institute for Standards in Technology, or NIST, release a report on Nov. 14 that provides a comprehensive analysis of hardware security vulnerabilities that could affect millions of devices worldwide. \"Hardware is often assumed to be robust from a security perspective,\" the researchers note. However, modern computer chips contain millions of components and embedded software, often called firmware. Unlike software vulnerabilities that can be patched with updates, hardware flaws are physically embedded in silicon—making them extremely difficult and expensive to fix.\nThe Silicon Problem: When Hardware Security Fails Remember Spectre and Meltdown? Those processor vulnerabilities that sent the tech industry into a panic in 2018? According to NIST's findings, that might have been just a preview of what's possible when hardware security fails. NIST has identified seven major categories of hardware vulnerabilities, each representing a different way your devices could be compromised.\nThe most common being access control problems, with 43 different scenarios where unauthorized users could potentially access sensitive information or control systems. \"An HW weakness may start a chain of software weaknesses,\" the researchers warn. In other words, a single hardware flaw could compromise just about every piece of software running on the device. And unlike software bugs that can be fixed with a patch, these vulnerabilities are permanent—they're physically etched into the chips themselves.\nAccess Control Problems: Think of your device's hardware like a secure building. NIST researchers found 43 different ways the \"security guards and locks\" in computer chips can fail. For example, during routine maintenance, someone with physical access to a device could potentially steal sensitive information like encryption keys—essentially getting master keys to all your data. This is the most common type of hardware vulnerability they discovered. Resource Management Issues: Imagine your computer's hardware as a city's infrastructure system. NIST identified 40 ways these resource management systems can fail. When they do, attackers might be able to manipulate how your device uses memory or power, potentially causing crashes or stealing sensitive information left in the device's memory—like finding confidential documents in a public trash bin. Security Mechanism Failures: These are failures in the basic security features built into hardware—like having a safe with a broken lock. The researchers found 15 different ways these fundamental security systems could fail, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized access to systems. What makes these particularly dangerous is that they can't be fixed with a simple software update. Coding Standard Issues: Even hardware needs to be programmed, and NIST found 14 scenarios where poor programming practices during the design phase create permanent vulnerabilities. Unlike software bugs that can be patched, these flaws are physically embedded in the chips. Control Flow Problems: The researchers identified 11 ways attackers could manipulate how hardware processes instructions. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to change how your device operates at its most fundamental level. Error Handling Problems: When unexpected situations occur, hardware needs to handle them safely. NIST found five scenarios where this error handling could fail, potentially allowing attackers to exploit moments of confusion in the system to gain unauthorized access. Comparison Errors: While only one scenario was identified in this category, it's a critical one. It's like having a security guard who can't properly check IDs—when hardware makes mistakes in comparing values, like passwords, it might incorrectly verify who should have access to what. The implications of this report are daunting. A single flaw in a widely used chip could affect millions of devices worldwide. I already mentioned Spectre and Meltdown, which affected virtually every modern processor—from the chips in our smartphones to those powering critical infrastructure.\nWhat Time Is Netflix’s Live Jake Paul Vs. Mike Tyson Fight On Friday? Trump’s Cabinet: Here Are His Picks For Key Roles—RFK Jr, Doug Burgum, Matt Gaetz And More NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Friday, November 15th The report outlines several scenarios that are sobering:\nEncryption Key Extraction During Maintenance: When technicians perform routine maintenance on devices, they often need special access to debug or test the hardware. The NIST report reveals that during these maintenance procedures, attackers could potentially extract sensitive encryption keys that are normally protected. Think of it like a hotel room safe—while it's secure during normal operation, if someone has maintenance access, they might be able to retrieve the master code. This is particularly dangerous because these encryption keys could be used to protect all data on the device. Exposed Manufacturing Data During Debug Operations: During debugging, when technicians try to identify and fix problems, devices often expose detailed information about how they were manufactured and configured. The report warns that this sensitive manufacturing data could help attackers understand exactly how the device works and where its vulnerabilities lie. It's similar to having detailed blueprints of a building's security system—in the wrong hands, this information could be used to plan an attack. Physical Access Security Compromises: \"A malicious human can leverage physical access to obtain restricted information because the physical security features are insufficient,\" the report states. This means that simply having physical access to a device could allow attackers to bypass security measures that are supposed to protect it. Unlike software attacks that happen over networks, these hardware vulnerabilities require physical contact with the device—but once an attacker has this access, they might be able to completely compromise the device's security. Power Management Manipulation: Modern devices have complex power management systems to conserve energy and manage performance. The NIST researchers found that flaws in these systems could be exploited by attackers to manipulate how devices behave. Attackers might force a device into low power modes at critical moments and use those power fluctuations to bypass security features. Hardware Security: Industry Impact The researchers emphasize that hardware security must be considered from the earliest stages of design—not treated as an afterthought. \"Organizations must take proactive steps to address these weaknesses before they become vulnerabilities,\" Mell and Bojanova urge. But here's the catch: fixing these issues isn't just a matter of pushing out a software update. It requires redesigning and replacing physical components—a process that could cost billions.\nThe report serves as a wake-up call for the technology industry: while software security remains important, we must also ensure that the physical foundation of our digital world —the hardware itself —is secure from the ground up. As our world becomes increasingly dependent on digital technology, the security of hardware components becomes ever more crucial. The next major cybersecurity breach might not come from a sophisticated software hack, but from a flaw literally built into the silicon heart of our devices.",
