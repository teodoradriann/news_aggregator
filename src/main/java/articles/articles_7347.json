    "text": "- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, accounting for more than 80% of cases.\n- Immunotherapy is one of the newest treatment options for HCC, but not everyone responds to it.\n- Researchers from Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center found combining immunotherapy with a personalized anti-tumor vaccine increased tumor shrinkage compared to immunotherapy alone.\nLiver cancer is the\nsixth most common cancer in the world. Researchers estimate03022-7/fulltext) 905,700 people were diagnosed with liver cancer in 2020 and that number is expected to hit 1.4 million by 2040. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver cancer, accounting for more than 80% of all cases\nOne of the newest treatment options for HCC is\nimmunotherapy past studies00178-2/fulltext) show only 15–20% of HCC diagnoses respond to immunotherapy and about 30% may be resistant.\nNow, the results of a preliminary clinical trial show that people with HCC treated with immunotherapy and a\npersonalized anti-tumor vaccine\nThe results of the trial were published April 7 in\nNature Medicine\nThis preliminary clinical trial was for\nGNOS-PV02 — a personalized DNA vaccine created by Geneos Therapeutics.\n“Essentially GNOS-PV02 aims to (educate) the immune system to recognize antigens that are present in the cancer so that the immune system can better recognize and attack cancer cells,” explained lead study author\nMark Yarchoan, MD, associate professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n“The vaccine is personalized for each individual patient’s cancer. Just the way that every person has a unique fingerprint, every cancer has its own set of unique antigens that are derived from unique DNA mutations within the cancer,” Yarchoan told Medical News Today.\n“To make a personalized vaccine, first a biopsy is obtained of the cancer, and the cancer DNA is sequenced to identify the potential unique antigens within the cancer. Then a personalized vaccine is manufactured that encodes the unique antigens identified in the analysis of the tumor biopsy.”\n— Mark Yarchoan, MD, lead study author\nGNOS-PV02 was used in conjunction with the immunotherapy drug\npembrolizumab, known under the brand name Keytruda.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted\napproval\n“Despite recent advances in the treatment of HCC, only a minority of patients respond to contemporary systemic treatments and the prognosis for patients with advanced disease is inferior to most other tumor types,” Yarchoan said.\nYarchoan noted that until recently, most cancer vaccines failed in the clinic, citing a number of potential reasons as to why.\n“One reason is that past cancer vaccines usually targeted antigens that weren’t specific enough to the cancer,” he said. “Most cancer antigens are unique to an individual cancer, and the technology to personalize cancer vaccines has only been possible very recently.”\n“But the other reason why cancer vaccines generally failed in the clinic is that they were used against advanced cancers, without any other immunotherapy,” Yarchoan continued.\n“We’ve learned that vaccines can cause immune cells to become exhausted before they can eliminate cancer cells. For this reason, contemporary cancer vaccines are often combined with other immune-activating therapies like pembrolizumab. This prevents the vaccine-induced T cells from becoming exhausted,” he explained.\nResearchers recruited 36 participants for this clinical trial. All participants received the combination of GNOS-PV02 vaccine and pembrolizumab.\nAt the end of the study, researchers found that almost one-third of participants experienced tumor shrinkage, which is about twice as many people seen in studies of immunotherapy alone for HCC.\nAdditionally, about 8% of the study participants had no evidence of a tumor after receiving the combination treatment.\n“The response rate on this study is high enough that I think it’s unlikely that the pembrolizumab alone did this — it supports the idea that the vaccine contributed to the efficacy observed,” Yarchoan said.\n“I think it’s also notable that the response rate was higher than pembrolizumab alone without a major increase in toxicity.”\n“I think the results are highly encouraging, but larger randomized studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of personalized cancer vaccines and to define the optimal treatment sequence for their use. Larger clinical studies are being planned by (Geneos Therapeutics) and I’m hopeful that such studies will confirm that this vaccine is an active agent.”\n— Mark Yarchoan, MD, lead study author\nAfter reviewing the results of this study,\nAnton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and Director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT he was “absolutely astonished” at the results in this early vaccine trial.\n“HCC is one of the most common cancers in the world and it’s typically been very resistant to treatment,” Bilchik explained. “Recently, immunotherapy has been introduced as a possible treatment for patients with advanced HCC, but the response rates for immunotherapy have not been great.”\n“What this study does is take patients’ own tumor and create a personalized vaccine, which doubles the response of the immunotherapy that is currently used for HCC,” he continued. “Not only are the results astonishing, but these are patients that have failed first-line treatment and are not amenable to resection or transplantation.”\nMNT also spoke with\nMartin Gutierrez, MD, director of Phase I research at the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study.\n“(This is) very encouraging news,” Gutierrez commented. “(The next research step should be a) larger Phase II trial in first-line therapy.”\nWhen asked if we will see more personalized cancer vaccines in the future, Bilchik said absolutely.\n“This is the future. And what makes this approach unique is that not only are they using the patient’s own tumor biopsy cells to identify these mutations, but they take it a step further by using these computational algorithms to predict which genes can be recognized by the patient’s own immune system. So this is getting into the field of really advanced technology and then ultimately artificial intelligence.”\n— Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",
