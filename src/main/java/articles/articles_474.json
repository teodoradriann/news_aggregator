    "title": "A November to Remember: Spain's Tourism Hits a High with 5.1 Million Visitors - Focus on Travel News - ftnnews.com",
    "text": "In November 2023, Spain’s tourism industry reached a remarkable milestone, welcoming 5.1 million international tourists, marking an 18.6% increase compared to the same month in 2022. This significant growth not only highlights Spain’s enduring appeal as a top travel destination but also signals a strong recovery and resurgence of the global tourism sector. The increase in tourist numbers is a testament to Spain’s diverse attractions, from its sun-soaked beaches to rich cultural heritage, appealing to a wide range of travelers. The United Kingdom led the surge, contributing over 1.0 million tourists, a 15.2% increase from November 2022. France and Germany followed closely, with 0.6 million arrivals each, showcasing an increase of 9.0% and 18.5%, respectively. This upward trend in tourism was not limited to November alone. The first 11 months of 2023 saw an 18.2% increase in tourist visits, with the total number exceeding 79.8 million. This figure even surpassed the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 by 0.8%, indicating a robust recovery and a positive outlook for Spain’s tourism industry. The type of accommodations chosen by these tourists also varied, with a notable preference for market accommodations. Hotel accommodations grew by 13.8%, while rented dwellings saw a significant increase of 39.5%. Non-market accommodations, including vacation home ownership and staying with family or friends, also saw an increase, highlighting the diverse preferences of international travelers. The length of stay for these tourists varied, with a majority opting for four to seven nights, reflecting the typical vacation duration. The number of tourists traveling without a package tour also increased, indicating a trend towards more independent and personalized travel experiences. Spain’s main tourist destinations during this period included the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and Andalusia. The Canary Islands, known for their beautiful landscapes and pleasant climate, received 12.4% more tourists than in November 2022. Catalonia and Andalusia also saw significant increases in tourist numbers, by 19.7% and 21.5%, respectively. The data, which is provisional and subject to revision, is part of the Tourist Movement on Borders Survey (FRONTUR). This survey aims to estimate the number of non-residents visiting Spain and to understand the main characteristics of their trips. The methodology adheres to international definitions and recommendations, ensuring accurate and reliable data. Spain’s tourism sector’s performance in November 2023 is a clear indicator of the country’s enduring appeal and its ability to adapt and thrive in a changing global landscape. The increase in tourist numbers not only boosts the economy but also reinforces Spain’s position as a leading global tourist destination. As the world continues to navigate the post-pandemic era, Spain’s tourism success story offers hope and inspiration. It demonstrates the resilience of the travel industry and the enduring appeal of cultural and natural attractions. With its diverse offerings and welcoming atmosphere, Spain continues to captivate the hearts of travelers from around the world.",

    "title": "A 'significant objection' to 529 college savings plans will go away on January 1. 'It's a big deal,' experts say - Business News",
    "text": "Until now, 529 savings plans were widely considered the best way to save for college. But according to financial experts and planning investors, there has always been a major hurdle. The funds were to be used for qualified education expenses such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board. Even though restrictions have been relaxed in recent years to include continuing education classes, apprenticeship programs, and even student loan payments, Any limit on this future savings has created “a mental barrier” Vivian Tsai, President of the College Savings Foundation. Starting in 2024 — thanks to “SECURE 2.0,” a number of measures affecting retirement savers — families can roll unused money from 529 plans into Roth individual retirement accounts free of income taxes or tax penalties. “Most people's objection is, 'What if I don't use this money for education.' Now you can use it for retirement,” Tsai said. “This removes an important objection.” “This is a big deal,” he said. Benefits of 529 College Savings Plan These schemes are continuously gaining momentum for several reasons. In some states, you may receive a tax deduction or credit for contributions. Some states also offer additional benefits to their residents, such as scholarships or matching grants, if they invest in their home state's 529 plan. Still, total investments in 529 plans fell to $411 billion in 2022, down about 15% from $480 billion a year earlier, according to data from the College Savings Plans Network, a network of state-administered college savings programs. More than personal finance: Is your year-end bonus check high in taxes? 3 Year-End Tax Tips from Top-Ranked Financial Advisors Annuity sales are on track for a record year “Last year, we saw a pretty significant decline in contribution behavior,” said Chris Lynch, president of tuition financing at TIAA. Regular contributions to a 529 college savings plan were left behind to pay more pressing bills or daily expenses, he said. Additionally, many prospective college students began to rethink their plans altogether. Some people are choosing to drop out altogether or consider a local and less expensive in-state public school or community college. Now, 529s offer more flexibility, even for people who never enroll in college, Lynch said. “One issue of resistance from potential participants is the limitations surrounding what happens if my child gets a scholarship or decides not to go to college,” Lynch said. In such cases, you can transfer the funds to another beneficiary, or withdraw them and pay taxes and penalties on the earnings. If your student wins a scholarship, you can usually withdraw up to the scholarship amount penalty-free. However, the added benefit of being able to convert any leftover funds to a Roth IRA tax-free after 15 years, up to the $35,000 limit, “helps eliminate that point of resistance,” he said. “At this point it becomes a no-brainer,” said Marshall Nelson, a wealth advisor at Crave Advisors in Salt Lake City, Utah. There are still some limitations. A 529 account must be open for 15 years and account holders cannot carry forward contributions made in the previous five years. Rollovers are subject to annual Roth IRA contribution limits, and there is a lifetime limit of $35,000 on 529-to-Roth transfers. Still, “we're going to see an increase in the use of 529,” Nelson predicted. Even if someone put $35,000 into a Roth IRA in their mid-20s and left it alone, that amount could be worth closer to $1 million after 40 years, he said. “It's something I see catching on,” Nelson said. “Now they have the option to use that money to supplement retirement. It's a big win.” Don't miss these stories from CNBC Pro: Source: www.bing.com",

    "text": "Ogilvy México gana en Cannes Lions 2024 sus dos primeros Leones en las categorías de Health & Welleness y Sustainable Development Goals, con su emblemática campaña “Test-icles”.\n“Test-icles” es una idea creativa, innovadora, poderosa que transmite un mensaje basado en los datos y la ciencia. Esta campaña le habló a los hombres de una manera diferente, poco convencional y entretenida, para hacerles un llamado al cuidado de su salud a través de la utilización de una prueba de embarazo femenina para detectar un posible cáncer testicular. Además de invitar a la autoexploración y la visita a un médico especialista, todo esto a través de la creación de dos personajes con características únicas, Tano & Nato.\nAl respecto Verónica Hernández, CEO de Ogilvy México & Miami comentó “Estamos sumamente felices de recibir en casa estos 2 Leones en dos categorías tan representativas como lo son Health & Wellness y Sustainable Development Goals y de haber contado con otros 4 shortlists con nuestra campaña “Test-icles”. Así también, estamos muy orgullosos de los 2 shortlists que recibimos con nuestras campañas “Future Talks” para Casa de la Amistad & “Asientos Vacíos” para Aeroméxico. Cannes Lions es el lugar donde brilla la creatividad y es importante utilizarla para resolver diversas temáticas y ponerla también al servicio de diferentes sectores de la sociedad, ésta en nuestro ADN. Es por eso por lo que, en esta ocasión, llegar a un sector tan relevante como es el de la salud, es un verdadero testimonio del talento excepcional del equipo, de nuestra Red y de nuestro preciado partner Fundación de Alba. Todo este espíritu colaborador en pro del bienestar y la salud de la sociedad es un motor que nos impulsa a seguir adelante, con el objetivo de crear conciencia y tener un impacto transformador en la vida de las personas alrededor del mundo”. Y añadió “solo puedo decir Gracias a todos y cada uno de los gigantes que con su pasión, entrega, dedicación y compromiso llevaron a Ogilvy México a rugir en Cannes Lions 2024”\nRafael Reina, CCO Ogilvy México & Miami “Regresar a México con 2 Leones de bronce y 4 shortlists con nuestra campaña “Test-icles”, y haber sido reconocidos con 2 shortlists para nuestros clientes Casa de la Amistad con “Future Talks” y Aeroméxico con “Asientos Vacíos” nos llena el corazón. Nuestro proyecto “Test-icles” deja un legado para la detección temprana del cáncer testicular, eso es muestra del compromiso del gran equipo de Ogilvy por encontrar soluciones innovadoras para resolver problemas actuales. Se creo a dos personajes “Tano & Nato” para caracterizar los miedos que reflejaban las personas ante la realización de auto examinarse. Además, desarrollamos un sistema de apoyo en colaboración con la Fundación de Alba, nuestro gran partner, para brindar acompañamiento a los casos positivos y tener acompañamiento médico. Este enfoque refleja el verdadero significado de nuestro borderless creativity, que termina impactando positivamente en la vida de las personas”. Y finalizo “infinitas gracias al equipo por la gran pasión y entrega siendo fieles al Divine Discontent y hacer el mejor trabajo de nuestras vidas para nuestros clientes”\nPor su parte, Marcela Estrada, Directora Creativa de Ogilvy México concluyo “Ganar 2 Leones de bronce en Cannes, en dos categorías que premian ideas que mejoran la vida de las personas, ¡es increíble! . En Ogilvy creemos que si podemos cambiar la vida de una persona a través de lo que más nos gusta hacer, la creatividad, habremos dejado un granito de arena en el mundo. “Test-icles” ayuda a concientizar a los hombres sobre la importancia de la salud masculina y muestra que, de una forma fácil y económica se puede realizar una prueba de tamizaje, existente en cualquier farmacia, para la temprana y posible detección de un cáncer testicular. Y añadió “Estamos muy agradecidos por el apoyo de todo el equipo de la Fundación de Alba, Ogilvy México, Ogilvy Health y el equipo de Ogilvy Latam que desde el primer día se entregaron a “Test-icles” con la misma pasión que nosotros”.\nPara más información: https://testicles.mx/ y https://fundaciondealba.org/\nFICHA TÉCNICA:\nGlobal Chief Creative Officer: Liz Taylor\nDeputy Chief Creative Officer Worldwide: Joe Sciarrotta\nCEO Ogilvy LATAM: Horacio Genolet\nCEO Ogilvy México & Miami: Verónica Hernández\nCCO LATAM: Keka Morelle\nCSO LATAM: Thais Frazao\nGlobal CEO, Ogilvy Health: Kim Johnson\nCCO, Ogilvy Health North America: Renata Maia\nCCO México & Miami: Rafael Reina\nRegional Creative Director: Marcela “Mashe” Estrada\nOgilvy LATAM Creative Excellence: Adriana Weinberg\nOgilvy México Creative VP: Diego Rodríguez\nHead Health & Wellness Ogilvy MX y LATAM: Eileen Dávila\nCOO Ogilvy Mexico: Julian Torres\nChief Communication Officer LATAM: Marina Piacentini\nCEO GroupM México: Marina Gunther-\nFundadora y Presidenta Fundación de Alba: Rebecca de Alba\nDirectora General Fundación de Alba: Miryana Pérez\nDirectora de Gestión de Recursos Fundación de Alba: Artemisa Couto\nMédico Oncólogo: Dr. Miguel Ángel Álvarez Avitia\nSr Art Director: Uriel Sánchez Cureño\nSr Copywriter: Francisco “Curi” Miranda\nMotion Graphic Designer: Izamary Ramírez\nH&W Account Business Leader: Rebeca Rios\nAccount Director: David Ontiveros\nHead of Production: Rosa Elena Arizmendi\nProducer: Alejandra Rodríguez\nStrategic Plannning Director: Landy Millán\nHead of Communication México: Paula Santiago\nHead of Influence México: Paulina Villanueva\nHead of Experience: Laurie King\nTech Operations Manager: Karla Magallán\nHead Digital Product: Armando Rosas\nUX/UI Lead: Juan Carlos Betancourt\nFront End: Elena Álvarez\nFront End Sr.: Isaac Pozos\nBack End Sr.: Carlos Martínez\nQA Lead: Verónica Carranza\nQA Sr.: Edgar González\nPricing & Investment Director GroupM: Juan Pablo Organista\nDigital Supervisor GroupM: Jocelin Matias\nInvestment Supervisor GroupM: Karen Castillejos\nInvestment Executive GroupM: Danilo Bucio\nMúsica por: Estudios Machina\nDesarrollo y animación de personajes: Believe.tv, Santiago de Chile.\nLocución por: Olín Garcés, Moises Curiel",
