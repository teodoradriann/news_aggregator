    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "Storm Gerrit Aftermath Continues, Predicted to Cause Travel Chaos\nBritons were cautioned about an impending tumultuous final weekend of 2023 following the havoc caused by Storm Gerrit, with forecasts predicting the return of strong winds and further disruptions across the nation’s road and rail networks.\nTravel Disruptions and Weather Warnings\nRail operators urged people to travel early due to concerns over anticipated disruptions and staff shortages when severe weather conditions, including high winds, rain, and potential snowfall, hit over the upcoming days.\nPresently, Storm Gerrit’s impact lingers, causing continued disruptions in Wales and Scotland and leading to cancellations on various routes.\nMultiple Rail Operators Facing Challenges\nSeveral train operators, including LNER, Avanti West Coast, and London Northwestern Railway, issued advisories to travelers to check for service alterations before their journey.\nStaff shortages, engineering works, and weather-related complications have compounded the challenges for rail services, prompting warnings of limited services and early closures on New Year’s Eve.\nWeather Forecast and Post-Storm Cleanup\nThe Met Office highlighted the approach of another low-pressure system expected to bring unsettled weather, including rain and snow across northern areas.\nAlthough Storm Gerrit’s intensity has lessened, blustery conditions and scattered showers are still forecasted, while snow is anticipated for some elevated regions.\nLooking ahead, a shift to colder and more settled weather conditions is expected in mid-January.\nPost-Storm Cleanup and Ongoing Impact\nIn the storm’s aftermath, thousands of homes were left without power, and the cleanup operations commenced.\nPower companies strived to restore electricity to affected areas, with significant efforts in Scotland and Wales, while disrupted ferry services and cancellations in air travel added to the post-storm disruptions.\nFatalities and Property Damage\nTragically, three individuals lost their lives after their vehicle submerged in a river, attributed to storm-related incidents.\nProperty damages, including missing roofs and vehicle damage, were reported due to the storm, while insurers affirmed that standard policies would cover the storm-related damages.\nContinued Impact on Travel Services\nFerry services and air travel faced delays and cancellations due to storm-related conditions, with DFDS confirming sailings were delayed in the English Channel.\nThough most air services have returned to normal, travel disruptions persist across various modes of transportation due to the lingering impact of Storm Gerrit’s aftermath.\nRead More On The Topic On TDPel Media []https://pelmedic.com",

    "text": "2025年07月17日10:35 | 来源： 人民网－湖南频道 小字号\n“以前灌溉浇地靠抽地下水，费劲又费钱。现在渠道修好了，西干渠渠段的水直接连到田地头 ”家住益阳桃江县浮邱山乡的龚大爷向开展日常监督的纪检监察干部感慨地说道。这项承载乡村振兴使命的工程目前已经圆满竣工，而桃江县纪委监委的全程监督，成为工程廉洁高效推进的坚实保障。\n桃江，全域有“鱼米之乡”之美誉，虽有资水穿境而过，但每逢干旱年份，因库区降水偏少、水库库容缩减，农业用水便成群众心头难题，部分村内农田更因沟渠失修“望河兴叹”。当地群众曾打趣道：“近水解不了近渴。”为解燃眉之急，保障全县农业发展和村民增收，桃江县纪委监委立足再监督职责定位，压实相关部门主体责任，扎实推进病险水闸、险工险段加固改造、信息化建设等项目建设，助推水利工程“健康升级”。\n“工程项目的三大员在不在现场，按计划工程进度现在完成怎么样？目前实际进度怎么样？施工中有哪些困难？”这是去年5月份以来，桃江县纪委监委工作人员持续督导了解桃花江灌区续建配套与现代化改造项目建设情况的缩影。\n以此为契机，桃江县纪委监委聚焦桃花江灌区续建配套与现代化改造项目，针对工程建设中的重点领域、关键环节，做好廉政风险排查。采取“两单一书”的形式对工程项目靠前监督、精准监督。强化对权力运行的制约和监督，并通过加强廉政宣传教育、建立内部监督机制、加强工程监督检查等多种措施推动工程项目建设廉洁高效运行。\n自该改造项目启动，桃江县纪委监委全程跟进，将监督“探头”前移，把改造项目纳入民生领域监督的重点对象，构建全链条监督体系。通过现场勘察、查阅施工资料、听取汇报等方式，详细了解项目的招投标、施工进度、工程质量、资金管理使用等情况，针对各种堵点、难点问题，当场指出存在的问题，建立问题台账，逐一清点、逐一反馈、逐一制定方案，为项目建设扫清障碍。截至目前，桃花江灌区管理局累计提质改造引水渠、干渠、骨干支渠共计106.55公里，完成排水沟清淤工程11.87公里，巡渠道路75.138公里，干支渠附属建筑物732处，增设安全护栏17.50公里，实现了工程进度百分百、支付进度百分百、廉政建设百分百的总目标，今年3月26日灌区改造项目已经实现通水灌溉。灌区灌溉覆盖率稳定在90%以上，清水流进田间，为粮食丰收筑牢“水根基”。\n“我们将始终聚焦群众急难愁盼，持续强化全程监督，办好民生事，做好‘水文章’，护航项目高标准建设、高质量运行，确保发展红利切实惠及人民群众。”桃江县纪委监委相关负责人表示。（郭益丰 彭志成）\n(责编：黄卓、罗帅) 分享让更多人看到",
