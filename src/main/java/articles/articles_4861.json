    "text": "This month, a deeply distressing incident transpired in Busia, Uganda, bringing to the forefront the pervasive problem of religious persecution in the region. Sawuba Naigaga, a 46-year-old woman, regrettably met her demise due to injuries inflicted by her son, highlighting the difficulties encountered by those who adopt Christianity in a society predominantly adhering to the Muslim faith.\nShocking Turn of Events\nAfter completing a four-year work assignment in Saudi Arabia, 25-year-old Ashirafu Basalirwa returned home to a startling discovery. His mother, Sawuba Naigaga, was found engaged in prayer, invoking the name of Jesus. The subsequent events took a distressing turn, escalating from verbal reproach to physical violence. Expressing disapproval for what he perceived as his mother disgracing the family and the tenets of Allah, Basalirwa forcefully pushed Naigaga against a wall before administering a critical blow to her head with a blunt object.\nRead More:\nTwo Christians hospitalised after Christian-Muslim dialogue in Uganda\nConversion Dilemma\nSawuba Naigaga, without the knowledge of her family, adopted Christianity in 2022 following a discreet introduction to the teachings of Jesus by a friend. Despite her regular attendance at church, Naigaga opted to maintain secrecy regarding her newfound faith. The tragic turn of events occurred when her son uncovered her devotion to Christ, revealing the delicate predicament faced by Christians in Uganda, where religious conversion can result in serious repercussions.\nNavigating the Aftermath\nFollowing the brutal assault, Ashirafu Basalirwa opted to go into hiding, expressing apprehension over potential reprisals in the heightened religious tension prevailing in Uganda. His actions highlight the precarious situation faced by individuals who embrace a faith divergent from the prevailing one within their community.\nPersecution in Uganda\nThe heartbreaking demise of Sawuba Naigaga is not an isolated incident but rather the latest chapter in a disconcerting narrative of documented persecutions against Christians in Uganda. Despite constitutional assurances of religious freedom, instances of violence against religious minorities persist, showcasing the challenges endured by those who opt for a different faith.\nStriving for Coexistence\nUganda, with its constitutional commitment to religious freedom, houses a predominantly Christian population. However, the challenges faced by the Muslim minority, constituting about 12 percent of the population, are evident in regions like eastern Uganda, where their presence is concentrated.\nRead More:\nTwo incidents of religious persecution have come to light in Uganda\nThe tragic tale of Sawuba Naigaga highlights the imperative to address religious intolerance in Uganda urgently. The right to practice one’s faith must be upheld, fostering an environment where individuals can peacefully coexist, irrespective of their religious beliefs. As Uganda grapples with this pressing issue, the aspiration is for a future where diversity in faith is embraced, rendering tragedies like the one befalling Sawuba Naigaga relics of the past.",

    "text": "Jaipur: Two teachers of a government school in Rajasthan's Kota have been suspended for their alleged involvement in religious conversions and ties to proscribed terror outfits. Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar said that another teacher is facing probe in the incident. The suspension order was issued on Thursday night against Mirza Mujahid and Firoz Khan, reported ANI.The minister took action after Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, sent a memorandum to him alleging that activities of religious conversion and love jihad have been taking place in the school since 2019. The memo also alleged that three teachers have connections with banned outfits and links to Pakistani groups. Sarva Hindu Samaj also said that no action was taken in the matter despite an FIR.Education Minister Dilawar on Friday released a video statement saying that strict action has been initiated against three teachers in a government senior secondary school at Khajuri Odpur village in Sangod.\"In the Khajoori village of Sangod panchayat samiti in Kota district, the religion of a girl in senior secondary school was mentioned as 'Islam' in the transfer certificate of a girl despite her being a Hindu. A conspiracy of religious conversion and 'love jihad' is happening there, Hindu girls are being forced to offer namaz - this has come to our notice,\" he said, quoted ANI.He said the teachers will be terminated from the job if they are found to be involved in these acts.\"As soon as this was brought to my notice, I decided to take strict action against three teachers. In this context, I suspended two teachers - Firoz Khan and Mirza Mujahideen. Further action is being taken against one Shabana. All three of them have been sent to Bikaner. I will take strict action against them after a detailed investigation. If needed, I will expel them,\" the state minister added.",

    "text": "In short: Khali Peek has a legal cannabis vape for her epilepsy, but if she uses it at her TAFE she will be breaking the law. It is illegal to use cannabis vapes in smoke-free areas, even when they're legitimately prescribed by a doctor. What's next? Khali Peek and her father are advocating for an exemption for medicinal cannabis vapes. When Khali Peek is overcome with a feeling of dread and her heart begins to race, she knows that an epileptic seizure is not far away.\nMs Peek says she can \"almost always\" stop her seizure with a medicinal cannabis vape that her doctor prescribed her, but if she uses it at her TAFE she will be breaking the law.\nIn all states and territories, the use of medicinal cannabis vapes is illegal in all smoke-free areas, such as educational facilities, public buildings, workplaces, bus stops, and hospitals.\nIn Queensland, the non-smoking list also includes national parks, venues that serve food and drink, cars, aged care facilities, and outdoor pedestrian malls.\nThe Brisbane student said she typically did not have time to find a designated smoking area before her seizure struck.\nThe 19-year-old said some seizures came with as little as a minute's warning and sometimes she found herself unable to move or see properly in the lead-up.\nCalls to allow cannabis oil in hospital The father of a dying Brisbane child wants special permission from the Government to use cannabis oil in hospital.\nRead more\nThe visual arts student said she had dislocated her shoulder six times, received numerous cuts, and repeatedly hit her head during her seizures.\nMs Peek said one of her biggest fears was being caught out without her cannabis vape and causing permanent injury from a seizure.\n\"It's a big worry of mine that one day I'll hit my head the wrong way and I'll become paralysed or something,\" Ms Peek said.\n\"Those times when I can't use the cannabis vape really affects me not only physically but mentally as well and my anxiety goes through the roof.\n\"I would like to be able to use it freely when I need it.\"\nNo exemptions A Queensland Health spokesperson told ABC Radio Brisbane that prescribed medicinal vapes were not exempt from the state's smoking laws.\n\"Queensland's Tobacco and Other Smoking Products Act 1998 sets out a wide range of public places as legislated smoke-free areas,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"In most circumstances, the smoking ban applies to both smoked or vaped medicinal cannabis, even though these products are obtained through prescription.\n\"Smoking is a serious health risk, not only for the smoker but also for the people around them.\"\nThe laws are enforced by Queensland Health Environmental Health Officers, which has the power to issue fines.\nThe maximum penalty for vaping in a non-smoking area in Queensland is 20 penalty units, which is currently $3,096.\nSteve Peek says attending TAFE gave his daughter a sense of \"normalcy\", despite her condition. ( ABC Radio Brisbane: Kenji Sato )\nMs Peek's father Steve Peek wants to see medicinal cannabis vapes exempt from non-smoking laws.\nThe medicinal cannabis advocate said he lived with the fear that his daughter might be injured or killed by a seizure.\n\"This law is dangerous to my daughter,\" Mr Peek said.\n\"She needs to use that vape as soon as her myoclonic seizure starts, she doesn't have time to walk out to a designated smoking area or walk into a fire escape.\n\"If she doesn't have it right there she can potentially have a tonic-clonic seizure, and any tonic-clonic seizure can be fatal.\"\nABC Brisbane in your inbox Get local news, stories, community events, recipes and more each fortnight.

Staff members will receive raises and retroactive pay on December 15, 2023,” a district press release from November 2023 stated.\nThe TEA is also investigating the district over a complaint that trustees violated the Texas Open Meetings Act when making employment decisions regarding the district’s former superintendent, Christie Whitbeck.\nWhitbeck abruptly retired and vacated her position as superintendent on December 11, 2023.\nBlue jeans at center of controversy involving Fort Bend ISD at the polls Whitbeck served the district for two years and received a contract extension and raise in July 2023. However, she reportedly offered teachers an opportunity to wear jeans in October if they voted in the November elections.\nWhitbeck admitted to KPRC 2 investigates, “We had some jeans incentives.”\nIn a December interview , Whitbeck said she was blindsided when she had a meeting with the president of the district board of trustees who reportedly gave her an ultimatum -- opt for a voluntary retirement agreement or be terminated.\nFort Bend ISD superintendent says she was given choice by board to either retire or be terminated “Why I would have had the board president meet with me and tell me that she said you can opt for a voluntary retirement agreement or we’re going to pursue termination. And I’m like, ‘Well, termination for what?’ And there really is no cause for termination.” Whitbeck explained in the interview.\nThe district’s current superintendent, Marc Smith , says the district will cooperate with the investigation.\n“The district will fully cooperate with TEA’s investigation,” Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Marc Smith said. “We are dedicated to being transparent and will provide all requested information.”\n“It is a new day in Fort Bend ISD with a new administration,” Fort Bend ISD Board President Kristin Tassin said. “Our board intends to work with Dr. Smith to ensure our district fully cooperates with the TEA and is transparent with our community.”\nStay informed with KPRC 2's Breaking News Alerts",

    "title": "URI plans more student housing. Can that help the housing crunch in South County?",
    "text": "As interest in attending the University of Rhode Island continues to grow, the state’s flagship university said Wednesday it plans to build more student housing.\nURI plans to lease state land on the Kingston campus to a private developer, which would then build and operate student housing on the land, the university said in a press release. URI said it hopes the deal with the Gilbane Development Company will eventually provide more than 1,100 additional student beds.\nA report commissioned by the town of Narragansett and released earlier this year found that URI has not built enough housing for students , which has significantly altered the town’s housing market and contributed to a housing crunch for year-round residents. The university enrolled 17,511 total students in Fall 2021, according to the most recently available enrollment data submitted to the state Board of Education.\nEllen Reynolds, URI’s vice president for student affairs, says that many students choose to live off-campus and closer to the shore. But “if there’s a desire for students to live on campus,” Reynolds said, “we want to meet that need for them.”\nThe university and Gilbane are still studying the feasibility of the project, Reynolds said, but the aim is to deliver some new housing in the fall of 2027 and the remainder in the fall of 2028.\nThe Public’s Radio’s Luis Hernandez spoke with Reynolds about the university’s housing plans and what its neighbors can expect.\nInterview Highlights On the ‘town-gown’ relationship between URI and South Kingstown and Narragansett\nEllen Reynolds, URI vice president for student affairs: I will say that we have a terrific relationship with both… My division meets regularly with the chiefs of police to make sure that we’re aligned in what’s happening in the communities; that we’re working collectively on messaging that’s going out to students around safety, around being good neighbors; making sure that when students have issues in the community that they are shared with us so that we can address them through our community standards process that we have. Because we expect our students to not only follow the student handbook and be good citizens on campus, but also in the community.\nOn what community leaders say about the connection between URI and housing\nReynolds: I think they have indicated that there’s a concern about the affordability of housing for individuals and families …, and much of their concern is how much of the occupancy students take out of that…So I think there’s an ongoing dialogue regularly about what we have available on campus, how we can work to augment on campus, and then where we can work to make sure that the students who are living in the community are good community members and contributing positively to the communities they’re in.\nOn how the surrounding communities expect URI to help the housing crunch\nReynolds: Well, I think they’re expecting a partner, right? Somebody who’s willing to talk about it. Somebody who’s willing to advance, again, our housing portfolio where we can — where we financially can. And that’s something that we’ve always committed to and are doing.\nPersonally, I think it’s having dialogue around how we can do the best that we can to make sure that all community members have housing — safe, affordable housing. [And] again, that those students who choose to live in the community, because there are rentals available for them, are good citizens and contributing positively to the community that they’re living in.\nOn the university’s impact on South County\nI think I hear regularly from community members how much our students contribute; how they are good neighbors; how they are helpful, they enjoy having them around. Occasionally, I’ll hear they’re better than an AirBnB where that changes every week and we have the same students and they’re great…So, I think the majority of our students are good neighbors there [and] the people in the community appreciate them being there.\nThe Public’s Radio’s Jeremy Bernfeld contributed to this story.",

    "text": "MCLENNAN COUNTY, Texas — The Pet Circle Regional Animal Center is over capacity, meaning its 103% full as 2024 comes to a close.\n“I did make a visit here— it was more of the medical end, on the back end, but I was very satisfied, I was happy with what I saw,” Animal welfare board member Sylvia Campos said.\n“Great handling excellent communication skills with the pet owner she spoke with,” Animal welfare board member Carrie Spivey said.\nMembers of the animal welfare board made a couple of visits to the Pet Circle Regional Animal Center in the last few weeks and walked away with a positive response.\nOne member said improvements have been made since the city took over the shelter.\n“The interaction that I saw has stepped up since the last time I was here, before the switchover, but I know a lot was going on in the back,” Campos said.\n In the past year, Pet Circle has adopted out close to 2,000 animals, although this number is lower than in 2023 by about 400 animals.\nLooking at animals euthanized, Pet Circle is currently sitting at its highest euthanasia numbers since 2019. With 343 this year so far. Euthanized animals include injured, sick, aggressive court-ordered, and owner-requested euthanasia. The city said this in a statement,\n“We are showing a little higher this year than in the past few years, though we are still glad to be below our pre-COVID euthanasia numbers. Looking further into the numbers, our euthanasia for behavior category has seen an increase, however- that is a new category that was added part way through the year in 2023, so the 2023 categories wouldn’t have captured the full year compared to the 2024 category. For reference, behavior includes sub-categories of aggression, non-adoptable behaviors or other behaviors that can’t be rehabilitated, bite quarantine/bite history,”\nThe number of volunteers has also increased, with 120 people going through orientation since the program started in October.\nThe City of Waco tells me for the Pet Circle to achieve its no-kill mission, they rely on the community’s support to find homes for the animals in their care.",

    "title": "El socialismo y la violencia. Mentiras o disparates que, pese las pruebas, se siguen manejando - Por: Eligio Damas @elidamas",
    "text": "Hay personajes que van y vienen cuando hablan del sueño o buen deseo del socialismo. Hoy dicen una cosa y mañana otra. Eso sí, cuando escriben se toman el trabajo duro, eso lo reconozco, de jorungar en sus bibliotecas o notas personales, acumuladas con fines ya establecidos, de lo escrito por personajes distinguidos, intelectuales de renombre, que, si bien no avalan lo que ellos tienen como meta, si en cada trabajo, le permitan impactar a determinados lectores. No importa si las citas en nada fundamentan lo que sostienen a lo largo y en veces, hasta solo en parte, de lo que escriben y hasta si vienen o no al caso. Es una vieja argucia que hasta sirve para que esos escritores ganen prestigio y hasta fama de muy fundamentados y dignos referentes. Las citas, pudieran hablar de la cultura, el estudio y hasta acuciosidad del escritor y esto le sirve de \"portal\" y hasta de luces de bengala. Es como un vestirse de gala, según la moda, para llamar la atención, pese quien eso hace nada adicional gana, más si ya tienen su buena reputación. No hay en ellos muestra de mirar con sus propios ojos y juzgar según su cultura o capacidad de raciocinio el acontecer, sino simplemente volver al manualismo con adornos.\nHay además un convencionalismo académico que admite como pertinente y digno aquello que se nutra de citas de autores calificados, pese lo sustantivo carezca de pertinencia. Y, quienes ese ritual cumplen, son bien acogidos en determinados medios \"muy exigentes\" y en el academicismo.\nEn el caso señalado anteriormente, el lector queda impactado por el enorme arsenal de información, los soportes de autores prestigiosos y pertinentes, pese el uso que, de estos y sus ideas o sentencias, no avale lo sustantivo de lo que quien de ellos hace uso, sostenga en su trabajo como idea sustantiva o principal. Es un como ritual o baile armonioso para distraer y confundir al lector, en bien del prestigio de quien esto hace y muy poco para que la gente común entienda, aprenda y en consecuencia se arme de modo competente.\nEs como intentar interpretar lo que delante de mí está, se desenvuelve, no poniendo énfasis en lo que miro, escucho, los golpes o caricias que recibo, sino a partir de los textos acurrucados en mi biblioteca, que pudieran referirse a circunstancias parecidas y que, además, ya he leído y me han dado bases para enjuiciar lo que observo y siento, pero que no es lo mismo que dicen los libros, sino la realidad circundante.\nLa violencia no es sino un catalizador que puede servir para acelerar un proceso social de cambio y hasta para detenerlo. Justamente ella es utilizada, en el sistema capitalista, por las clases y capitales dominantes, para contener cualquier trascendencia de un acto de creación o simples potencialidades de comunidades o iniciativas de menor fortaleza que pudieran inducir al cambio, más si estas se introducen con interés competitivo. La especulación es violencia y lo son el monopolio y la cartelización. Pero la violencia por sí sola no genera un cambio sustantivo, pero tampoco lo derrota y menos entierra. El fuego es un catalizador o acelerador de una enorme violencia que puede hacer que el agua hierva y se evapore, pero otros fenómenos, como el descenso de la temperatura vuelve al mismo estado de antes. Por la violencia se puede lograr que un individuo asuma convencionalmente una conducta distinta a la habitual, pero desaparecida la presión o amenaza pudiera, no es extraño, volver a ser el verdadero o mejor originario.\nPorque es también sustancial determinar qué entendemos como violencia. ¿Qué es un comportamiento violento?\nEs por demás infantil y en consecuencia resabido, que la violencia toma muchas formas. En los años sesenta del siglo pasado, un psiquiatra venezolano, habló de la \"violencia pacífica\". Se refería a la manera de imponer conductas que restaban derechos a individuos y comunidades, por la vía de la \"persuasión, convencimiento\" o mejor alienación. Se trata de imponer a las comunidades, por distintos mecanismos \"pacíficos\", como la educación, la propaganda, halagos y hasta ofertas engañosas, conductas, ideas y hasta planes, que le son ajenas y hasta contrarios a sus intereses. Eso es \"violencia pacífica\", donde las armas, bien sean de fuego o simples hondas como la de David, son ajenas. En este caso, besos y halagos, son tan hirientes y mortales como las armas convencionales.\nEl Estado, el que sea, es un organismo vivo y armado, predispuesto para la violencia, imponer los cambios y mantener \"el orden\", pero no es original fuente del cambio y movimiento; es sólo un instrumento, como lo son las armas y las vanguardias heroicas.\nEn las viejas formas de vida, la familia, en primer término, luego la escuela, los grupos de compañeros, en buena o gran medida determinaban la conducta individual. Hoy, las impensadas formas de comunicación en los viejos tiempos, medios de comunicación o redes sociales, imponen la conducta individual, colectiva y hasta la \"verdad\". Y esto, es una forma muy sutil de violencia, hasta de la llamada pacífica, que se aplica en las estructuras formales y tradicionales del modelo social.\nEs de muy vieja data, desde las viejas culturas europeas y americanas, estas que aquellas \"descubrieron\", el uso de la violencia como forma de dominio e imposición de conductas individuales y colectivas. Los Incas, Aztecas y Mayas, culturas superiores en sus espacios, usaban la violencia para dominar a otras de menor fortaleza o crecimiento.\nPero es dudoso que la violencia, más si ella se pone por delante, de primera, con la intención de imponer las ideas y proyectos de las vanguardias o rebeldes que las conciben o atesoran, sea útil para que el colectivo las asuma como suyas y hasta contribuya a enriquecerlas.\nUn error sustancial que se ha cometido en Venezuela, a nuestro parecer, y en esto he sido persistente, es intentar promover las comunas, poniéndolas bajo el control del Estado y lo que es peor, como una continuación de este en pequeños espacios. Quien revise la Ley de las Comunas y todo lo que en ella se demanda, se le resta la fuerza de cambio y espíritu subversivo que pudiera haber en esa iniciativa de organización social y productiva. Pues el cambio pasa por generar nuevas formas de asociación, relaciones de producción a partir de la iniciativa popular, colectiva. De manera que aquellas que emerjan de esta sean de su creación y propiedad, lo que sería un cambio sustancial y pacífico. Lo otro es violencia, imposición que no será asumida con la debida pertinencia por el colectivo.\nEn el modelo feudal, las nuevas formas de relación social y productiva, como la artesanía, el intercambio y otras, la génesis del cambio, comenzó a darse en las pequeñas poblaciones nacidas alrededor de los feudos, conocidas como villas, que por haber empezado a originar nuevas formas de relacionarse, el trabajo artesanal libre, origen del pequeño patrón con operarios y por sus actos delictuales, así considerados por la nobleza propietaria, todo aquello que fuese en verdad un delito o no, pero sí un desafío al feudo y la nobleza feudal, se les llamó \"villanos\".\nY este engendro, incipiente cambio, pero sustantivo, en función de la subsistencia y la asociación, lo generó la creatividad humana y no la violencia por sí misma. Quizás esta, en distintas formas, como la exclusión, la aplicada por la nobleza contra los hombres libres o fugados en busca de la libertad, quienes se fueron agrupando y formando las villas, en un proceso largo y lento, como demandada la dialéctica, realidad o circunstancias, tuvo injerencia en el cambio, pero no fue lo determinante ni sustantivo. Pues la violencia por sí misma destruye y si algo llegase a crear, terminará en el exterminio y la derrota. Lo sí determinante, es la creatividad humana, colectiva, por subsistir y convivir, donde la participación de todos en forma pacífica y hasta hermanados, es fundamental. Eso de los dioses creativos, con la magia de acordar a todos y ponerlos en sintonía y acuerdo perfecto para la convivencia, se parece más a la violencia y a la idea de obligar y matar la creatividad y la fuerza para el cambio y el desarrollo de productividad humana y colectiva.\nEl Estado fue un parto de la violencia, cuando lo individual quiso imponerse sobre el interés y beneficio colectivo. Nació para darle sentido a un orden que se venía desarrollando dentro de las relaciones humanas y terminó, por su fuerza y acumulación de violencia, imponer los intereses de los más fuertes.\nTodo lo anterior viene a cuento por insistir en la creencia y el sueño que el socialismo está al alcance de la mano, particularmente en nuestras sociedades de eso que llaman el tercer mundo, mientras en el global la disputa transcurre por la multipolaridad dentro del dominio capitalista y donde jugamos un rol poco significativo y más bien expectante. Y, además, ignorando que esos intentos o experiencias habidos de crear un socialismo sólo contando con el catalizador de la violencia y procediendo a crear un Estado autoritario, como en la URSS, China de Mao, etc., un etc., para no generar discrepancias innecesarias, han terminado en la orilla después de tanto esfuerzo por nadar.\nDiógenes dijo, \"el movimiento se demuestra andando\". Y en efecto, si queremos construir el socialismo debemos mirar un poco la experiencia pasada y el carácter y naturaleza de los cambios.\nDecir que el cambio social es atribuible a la sociedad y particularmente a las masas, a la multitud, a esta no se le puede dar o asignar el subalterno rol de simple mirona, votante, adherente, obediente al Estado o a una vanguardia que de este se apodera y empieza a dictar leyes ajenas a su deseo, cultura, disposición o nivel.\nPensar que, en las sociedades de hoy, como en las del pasado, \"las clases subalternas no tienen esperanzas\" ni futuro, es un contrasentido, una falsa visión y hasta contraria a la dialéctica. El futuro está antecedido por el presente y es dentro de este y en él, donde el hombre, \"las clases subalternas\", deben luchar por el cambio, que se traduzca en una participación en correspondencia con su trabajo.\nLo que si no es pertinente plantearse objetivos ajenos a la realidad y sin el suficiente sustento. Lo cierto, es que el movimiento popular en el mundo todo, donde prevalece el dominio capitalista y hasta sociedades anquilosadas, llamadas indebidamente socialistas, en virtud que el Estado se apoderó de todo y la burocracia dominante hace de repartidora de lo \"poco que hay\", dada la improductividad del modelo y la incompetencia para superar las dificultades, se hace indispensable replantearse las formas de lucha, las que no son solo por los contratos colectivos, mejoras salariales, conquistas en distintos sentidos, sino también en la forma de organización de las masas trabajadoras dentro de un espíritu creativo que genere nuevas formas de relación y distribución de los beneficios, como lo hicieron quienes, al margen y en la marginalidad de los feudos, crearon las villas y las nuevas formas de subsistencia y organización.\nNo se trata de alzarse en armas contra el modelo y el orden existente, pues este gesto, por muy heroico que parezca no va a generar esas relaciones, nuevas conductas y cultura.\nLa frase atribuida a Sergio Zeta, un periodista argentino, según la cual \"\"Los pueblos consiguen derechos cuando van por más, no cuando se adaptan a lo posible\", pudiera ser y es valedera, como que si luchamos con denuedo por el salario y todo aquello que el capitalismo niega a los trabajadores podemos alcanzarlo y no esperar que nos sea concedida la gracia. Pero si pensamos, no en pequeñas conquistas sociales, sino en cambios sustantivos en el modelo económico, un capitalismo con mucha vida y bastante robustez todavía y donde los conflictos existentes son por la búsqueda del dominio o por lo menos de un equilibrio en la repartición o forma de relacionarse con los mercados, que llaman multipolaridad y no por la repartición equilibrada de los beneficios, lo pertinente no está en la violencia, sino en el trabajo creativo de las vanguardias que se introduzcan en el pueblo, entre los trabajadores a generar nuevas formas de relacionarse, cultura distributiva, solidaridad y empeño en luchar por cada conquista.\nLo anterior implica revisar la concepción y fines de los partidos que aspiran fungir de vanguardias. Seguir creyendo en vanguardias de acero, líderes destinados de antemano a los panteones y en la violencia de las armas, puños, petardos y simples manifestaciones, es seguir haciendo lo que tanto ha fracasado.",
