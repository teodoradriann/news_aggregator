    "text": "The Anglican Church of Nigeria, Owo Diocese has described the death of the late governor of Ondo state as a great loss to the Church of Nigeria (the Anglican Communion) especially the Diocese of Owo, Ondo State and Nigeria as a whole.\nThe Church in a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, Owo Anglican Diocese, Basorun Banjo Abitogun, on behalf of the Bishop of Owo Anglican Diocese, Dr Stephen Ayodeji Fagbemi, said Akeredolu as a committed member of the Diocese.\nAccording to him, Akeredolu, until his death was the Chancellor of the Diocese, describing him as a devoted Christian and a commited Anglican who was never ashamed to declare his faith in the crucified Lord, as a faithful soldier in obedience to his baptismal vow.\nBishop Fagbemi said “Chancellor Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu impacted the diocese so much and that members of the Diocese will remember him for his legacy of compassion, justice, and progress, which will linger in their hearts for generations to come.\n” The diocese will always celebrate him and thank God for who he was and all that he stood for in the diocese”\nThe Bishop therefore enjoined all, to keep praying for the entire Akeredolu family, the Diocese of Owo (Anglican Communion), and Ondo State in general.\nBishop Fagbemi also prayed God to grant the Diocesan Chancellor’s soul eternal rest, saying “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, for their deeds follow them.”(Rev. 14:13).\nREAD ALSO FROM\nNIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

    "text": "Bitcoin Bitcoin’s $11.8 billion Options to expire soon – Bearish 2025 to come? - Bitcoin Options expiry can be significant, as the expiration of large numbers of contracts can lead to sharp price movements - Call options were dominant at press time, with $7.9 billion in Open Interest indicating a bullish sentiment. [Bitcoin’s [BTC]]https://ambcrypto.com/category/bitcoin-news/ Options market is currently in a state of suspense as the high-stakes expiry on 27 December approaches. With bulls eyeing the $100k target following a surge in capital flow post-election, the Open Interest has skyrocketed – Hitting a new high of $50 billion. However, reaching $100k and maintaining it are two different challenges. While the current bullish sentiment, driven by a mix of micro and macroeconomic factors, suggests a potential new all-time high, the Options market must be closely watched. The $11.8 billion worth of end-of-year call and put orders set to expire could significantly influence Bitcoin’s price action in the coming days. Bitcoin Options show bias with call order dominance Bitcoin, at the time of writing, was trading under $90k, with its market dominance exceeding 60%. Over the last 24 hours, some price correction seemed to be taking shape too. In the Options market, Deribit led with a 74% market share, while CME and Binance each held around 10.3%. This concentration of activity on Deribit highlighted where the majority of betting on Bitcoin’s price movement is happening. According to Coinglass data , calls (bets on the price going up) make up nearly 70% of the orderbook, signaling strong bullish sentiment. In fact, many investors appear to be betting on Bitcoin reaching $100k, expecting further upside. However, if Bitcoin hits the $100k target, a significant amount of Options contracts (worth $11.8 billion) will expire, with the majority of these being Call Options (bets on the price going up). Consequently, traders who hold these Call Options are likely to exercise them or sell to lock in their profits. This can create selling pressure, especially if many traders decide to exit at once. Therefore, maintaining the $100k price level largely depends on how these contracts unfold. A temporary pullback could occur in two scenarios – When Call Option holders exercise their contracts and when Put Options begin to dominate. Can Bitcoin hit $100k amid growing volatility? Though Bitcoin hit a temporary dip after five days of consistent uptrend, mainly due to miner selling, long-term holders continue to maintain their positions. This, even as the market becomes increasingly over-leveraged with derivatives. As more traders enter the Bitcoin Options market, with a high number of stakes set to expire before the end of this quarter, volatility is hitting new highs each day. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin has continued its upward momentum, indicating that long positions are still dominating the market across various indicators . Simply put, the market hasn’t overextended yet. Despite the RSI being in extreme ‘overbought’ territory, miners offloading, and weak hands exiting for short-term gains, the impact on Bitcoin’s price hasn’t been drastic – Something that would typically be expected in such conditions. This means that the bulls are holding strong, and the $100k target is within reach. In fact, if Bitcoin hits this target before the end of the month, it wouldn’t be surprising. Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24 However, a shadow of uncertainty still looms in the Options market where $11.8 billion worth of contracts will ultimately decide whether Bitcoin enters the new year on a bullish or bearish note. The latter seems more likely, given the high stakes associated with the $100k price target and the call orders set to expire as volatility rises in the days ahead.",

    "title": "Liberia Moves to Create War Crimes Court, Decades After Civil Wars Ended",
    "text": "Liberia’s president has signed an executive order establishing a war crimes court, the culmination of a decades-long effort to bring justice to victims of the country’s two civil wars, which killed an estimated 250,000 people from 1989 to 2003.\nLawmakers in Parliament — including some who are expected to face prosecution under the court — passed a resolution calling for the move last month.\n“For peace and harmony to have a chance to prevail, justice and healing must perfect the groundwork,” President Joseph Boakai said as he signed the order on Thursday, to the applause of lawmakers and ministers.\nAlthough some of those behind the violence\nhave faced prosecution abroad, no one has been held legally accountable within the country for the massacres, rape, torture and conscription of child soldiers that left deep scars on generations of people in Liberia, a West African nation founded 200 years ago by freed slaves from the United States.\nIt was unclear on Friday how many cases might come before the court and when they might begin. Many of the perpetrators, and their victims, have since died.\nMr. Boakai’s executive order also paved the way for an economics crimes court, which would cover the companies and individuals who funded the wars’ various factions, but Parliament will first have to pass legislation to establish it.\nAfter decades of impunity, many Liberians had given up any hope of justice.\n“Nobody expected this would come,” said Adama Dempster, a rights campaigner who, as a young student in school in northeastern Liberia, saw his friends being recruited as child soldiers. Like many Liberians, he also witnessed summary executions and other crimes almost daily. Now in his mid-40s, he has long campaigned for the creation of such a court.\nLiberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which Parliament established nearly two decades ago, concluded its work in 2010 with a\ncall for the establishment of a court to try those responsible, and for reparations to be paid to the victims.\nBut neither the government of\nEllen Johnson Sirleaf, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who led Liberia from 2006 to 2018, nor that of her successor, George Weah, the soccer star turned president who was voted out of office late last year, acted on the commission’s recommendations, citing a lack of resources and security.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Boakai said the country needed to establish the truth about the violence and “to justly apportion the blame and rewards wherever they may lie.”\nHis executive order did not mention reparations.\nLiberia’s first civil war started in 1989, when the warlord Charles G. Taylor led a rebellion to overthrow the military regime of President Samuel Doe, who was later mutilated and killed by fighters under another warlord, Prince Johnson. Now a powerful senator known by his initials, P.Y.J., Mr. Johnson\nvideotaped himself drinking beer while ordering his forces to cut Mr. Doe’s ears off.\nIn the second civil war, from 1999 to 2003, two rebel groups tried to unseat Mr. Taylor, who by then had become president.\nThe court has taken so long to establish because key players in the war had government jobs, political power and economic influence, according to Tennen B. Dalieh Tehoungue, a Liberian scholar who focuses on justice, peace-building and reconciliation at Dublin City University in Ireland.\n“They refused to endorse any measure or mechanism that had punitive actions in it,” she said.\nMr. Johnson, now 71, was among those key players. But in the end, he and others involved in the civil wars signed the resolution calling for the court to be established.\nWhy they finally did so remains a mystery, although Ms. Tehoungue said she believed it to be a case of “big-man syndrome” — even as they signed it, “they assumed criminal prosecution would never happen.”\nAfter signing the measure, Mr. Johnson told journalists in Monrovia, the capital, that “we are up for peace, and we do not want any trouble.” He nonetheless justified his own actions in the civil war, saying: “I am a brave soldier. I came to liberate my people.”\nHundreds of thousands of people were killed, raped or lost their homes in the conflicts, which Human Rights Watch described as “a human rights disaster.”\nMr. Taylor, the former warlord turned president who is now 76, once ran under the election slogan “He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him anyway.”\nHe is currently serving a\n50-year sentence for crimes committed in the civil war of neighboring Sierra Leone in the 1990s. But he has never been tried for his actions during the wars in Liberia.\nMany Liberians expressed relief on Thursday that there would be some accountability at last.\n“Many victims and survivors never believed there would be justice in their time,” said Mr. Dempster, the human rights campaigner.\nThe post\n Liberia Moves to Create War Crimes Court, Decades After Civil Wars Ended appeared first on New York Times.",

    "text": "SMMUSD Announces Continued Closures for Malibu Schools, Resources for Families\nAs promised, The Santa Monica-Malibu School District has updated the status of the four Malibu schools that have been closed since Tuesday after the outbreak of the Franklin Fire. Gail Pinsker, Community & Public Relations Officer for SMMUSD shared the email from Superintendent Dr. Antonio Shelton giving parents and students of the Malibu Schools more information on what they can expect in the coming weeks and resources that will be available for families as Malibu recovers.\nAll four Malibu schools will be closed on Friday, December 13. These closures will not affect any of the eleven schools in the Santa Monica school district.\n** Email on behalf of Superintendent Dr. Antonio Shelton **\nMalibu Schools will Remain Closed, Friday, Dec. 13, 2024\nDear Malibu Families and Staff,\nAll four Malibu schools will continue to be closed on Friday, December 13, 2024, due to road closures and the active Franklin fire in the area. Evacuation orders, road closures, and power uncertainties remain in some neighborhoods. We have been unable to access our schools to professionally clean ensuring good indoor air quality for all students and staff upon return and clean outdoor spaces that may have debris from the strong winds, soot, and ash.\nAs we complete our third day out of school for our Malibu families and staff we understand the interest of families to have their children return to school to be with their friends and find support and comfort in their teachers and familiar spaces where they spend many hours each day. We are interested to see this as soon as possible, too, and continue to work toward this goal.\nMalibu Elementary, Malibu Middle, and Malibu High Schools all were spared from any damage; however, thorough cleaning by a professional restoration and cleaning company must be completed before reopening the school. This includes cleaning and changing filters in all heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems. We hope to clean on Friday, December 13, or over the weekend with the expectation to return to school on Monday, Dec. 16. We will notify all families and staff on Sunday, December 15 with this confirmation. This will depend on Pacific Coast Highway reopening and access to our school sites.\nAs we have announced to our Webster Elementary families and staff, electrical damage and some fire damage to the school will require additional repairs before this school reopens. The work will begin as soon as we have access, and we are hopeful to reopen this campus following winter break on January 6, 2025. Webster families have been asked to complete a survey regarding interest in attending in-person classes at Malibu Elementary School with Webster teachers next week as early as Tuesday, December 17, for families interested in returning to school next week. Options are being considered with that community, and decisions will follow.\nWe appreciate our educational partner, the Malibu Boys & Girls Club, who will provide childcare services to Webster families at Malibu Elementary School next week, along with mental health support for any Malibu students in need.\nUpon return to school, we understand that some families will still be dealing with the aftermath of this distressing event, including a few of our families who have lost homes or have damage. During this challenging time, parents may contact their school site to discuss excused absences. We know that evacuations and the concerns of this fire have some families temporarily located out of the area.\nContinue to watch for messaging from your site administrators with information and guidance directly regarding your school.\nWe will continue to be in touch and share your hope that a sense of normalcy returns to Malibu very soon. Please continue to take care of yourselves and each other.\nSincerely,\nDr. Antonio Shelton\nSuperintendent",

    "text": "The Night King: Mathieu van der Poel continues winning streak at Superprestige Diegem\nIserbyt wraps up second series title with one race remaining\nMathieu van der Poel has won on sandy courses, muddy courses and fast courses this season, and on Thursday the world champion triumphed in the Superprestige Diegem’s unique race under lights, carrying his 2023 win streak to eight. He took the Diegem race six times in a row in the latter half of last decade. With third place, Eli Iserbyt wrapped up his second Superprestige title with a race to spare.\nEarlier in the day, Jayden McMullen was the top Canadian in the Junior men’s race at 49th.\nThe Situation Before Thursday\nWout van Aert claimed his second triumph of the season in Wednesday’s sixth Superprestige round in Heusden-Zolder; Cody Scott was top Canadian in 51st. With two rounds to go, Wednesday’s runner-up Eli Iserbyt led third-place Joris Nieuwenhuis by 25 points at the top of the table. Van Aert, last year’s Diegem champ, was not racing under the lights on Wednesday. Ian Ackert and Fabian Merino made up the Canadian contingent.\nKevin Kuhn likes to lead races early, so he claimed the hole shot on Lap 1. Pidcock, who started in the third row, had to move up from 15th. The selection came early in the first circuit, as van der Poel, Pidcock, Iserbyt, Thibau Nys and Michael Vanthourenhout formed the lead group.\nThe artificially-illuminated Pidcock tried to shake van der Poel and company on Lap 2 but to no avail. The quartet was not far ahead of a chase trio containing Nieuwenhuis.\nA few lesser-known riders reinforced the front group on Lap 3. After Lap 4‘s sandpit, van der Poel made his move. Vanthourenhout and Pidcock were the closest chasers. By the midway point of the race, Pidcock, Vanthourenhout and Iserbyt were eight seconds behind.\nVanthourenhout was unhitched on Lap 5. This time van der Poel didn’t have to shove riders to lap them. Pidcock tried to lose Iserbyt. Nys abandoned the race after crashing with two others.\nOn the penultimate lap Eli and Tom fought a spirited battle for second place 38 seconds behind the man in the rainbow jersey. Iserbyt’s acceleration at the start of the bell lap dislodged the 2022 world champion, who toiled to catch up. Pidcock and Iserbyt were reunited, and the Brit won the contest for the second step.\nThe final round isn’t until February 10 in Middelkerke.\n2023-2024 Superprestige Series, Round 7, Diegem\n1) Mathieu van der Poel (The Netherlands/Alpecin-Deceuninck) 55:30\n2) Tom Pidcock (Great Britain/Ineos) +0:45\n3) Eli Iserbyt (Belgium/Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) +0:49",

    "text": "In his magisterial history The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon identified the loss of civic virtue as the “secret poison” that undermined this sprawling global empire and inevitably led to its demise. The Catholic Church is not about to disintegrate in the same fashion as the Roman Empire, but its unity, grounded in the infallible papal magisterium, seems to be unraveling, and its eternal doctrines are no longer safe from radical revision.\nWe can probably isolate several such poisons in the Church that undermine the deposit of faith, but there is one that is particularly insidious. It involves a departure from what liberal theologians regard as a “sexophobic morality,” and it accounts for profane documents such as Fiducia Supplicans. As everyone knows by now, this declaration from the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith sanctions the blessing of same-sex couples and those in other irregular relationships, so long as those blessings are not liturgical and do not convey the impression of marriage.\nFiducia Supplicans directly flows from principles and premises articulated in the apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia. Following the decadent path of moral theology of the 1970s, Amoris Laetitia misconstrues God’s authoritative commands as “rules” that express “ideals” to which we should all aspire. It ignores the fact that some of these commands, such as the divine prohibition against adultery, allow for no exceptions. On the contrary, these rules are subject to exceptions, excuses, and mitigating circumstances.\nOrthodox. Faithful. Free.\nSign up to get Crisis articles delivered to your inbox daily\nGiven our weakness and disposition to noetic and moral frailty, it’s not possible for everyone to follow these rules, especially those that pertain to sexual morality. According to Amoris Laetitia, some Catholics are “not in a position…to fully carry out the objective demands of the law” (295). The pope proceeds to explain that those in irregular situations, such as Catholics divorced and remarried without an annulment, are not necessarily living in a state of mortal sin even if they are not ignorant of the relevant rule. “A subject may know the rule, yet…be in a concrete situation which does not allow him or her to act differently and decide otherwise” (301).\nAmoris Laetitia clearly suggests that the Church’s traditional understanding of indissoluble, monogamous marriage, anchored in the words of Jesus Himself, is one of those lofty ideals. It refers to “the ideal of marriage, marked by a commitment to exclusivity and stability” (34). While this “ideal” cannot be negated, more flexibility is necessary in order to achieve psychological balance for those who cannot live up to its demands. The Church must begin to modify and limit its antiquated ideas about sexuality, even if it does so in ways that are essentially contradictory.\nThus, Amoris Laetitia presents the faithful with a revised attitude about sin (and particularly sexual sin) that softens the urgent need for conversion and repentance. Sin is conceived not so much as an offense against God but as a falling short of aspirations. Some Catholics cannot keep God’s commandments and are faced with the prospect of living at a distance from ideals like indissoluble marriage or chastity. It follows from this new theology that same-sex couples merit the Church’s blessing, since their only fault is failing to live up to moral ideals that are often too burdensome.\nIn\nanswering the dubia of five Cardinals submitted just before the Synod on Synodality, the pope wrote that while the sexual relationship of these same-sex couples may not be morally acceptable from an objective viewpoint, “pastoral charity requires that we do not simply treat as ‘sinners’ other people whose guilt or responsibility may be mitigated by various factors…” (emphasis added).\nMoreover, according to Amoris Laetitia, “a pastor cannot feel that it is enough to apply moral laws to those living in ‘irregular’ situations as if they were stones to throw at people” (305). Instead of throwing those stones like the Pharisees in John’s Gospel, a blessing is imparted, recognizing the positive elements in the relationship—“all that is true, good, and humanly valid in their lives” (Fiducia Supplicans, 31). Those positive elements suggest at least an imperfect living out of the ideal, and a blessing expresses the hope that this couple will strive to grow in full fidelity to the Gospel. However, the only way to truly achieve that fidelity is continence or a dissolution of this gravely sinful relationship. The painful reality that these couples are engaged in immoral activity, in sodomy or adultery, is ignored and obscured by a tangled web of euphemisms.\nWe find this same highly questionable reasoning in answers to the recent dubia submitted by\nCardinal Duka concerning reception of Confession and the Eucharist for those divorced Catholics who have entered into a second, civil union. Those dubia sought to clarify the ambiguity of Amoris Laetitia on this issue. This statement claims that after a period of discernment, divorced Catholics can receive sacramental absolution and the Holy Eucharist even if they do not live chastely in the second relationship.\nFor Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, these sacraments were only possible for those couples living out a chaste life. But according to the dubia, composed by Cardinal Fernández, “Francis maintains the proposal of full continence for the divorced and remarried in a new union, but admits that there may be difficulties in practicing it and therefore allows in certain cases, after proper discernment, the administration of the sacrament of Reconciliation [and the Holy Eucharist] even when one fails in being faithful to the continence proposed by the Church.” Thus, Catholic couples in a second marriage do not have to cease sexual relations if they conclude that such an action is not possible.\nOf course, there are many serious deficiencies in the theological reasoning of Amoris Laetitia. The supposition that keeping God’s commandments is impossible for some is completely incongruous with Scripture and Tradition. Jesus tells us that “whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received, and it will be yours” (Mark 11:24). We can also take comfort in Jesus’ instruction to St. Paul: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).\nThe heterodox doctrine of Amoris Laetitia also contradicts the clear teaching of Trent: “God does not command the impossible; but in commanding he cautions you both to do what you can and to pray for what you cannot, and He helps you so that you can do it.” God’s grace, therefore, allows every Christian to avoid grave sin. Also overlooked in Amoris Laetitia is the Church’s long and unyielding tradition absolutely forbidding sins of the flesh, including adultery, fornication, and homosexual activity, that has been witnessed to by many martyrs from saints like Agatha and Agnes to St. Maria Goretti.\nPope St. John Paul II was no stranger to the arguments resurrected by Pope Francis and addressed them quite explicitly in Veritatis Splendor:\nIt would be a very serious error to conclude that the Church’s teaching is essentially only an “ideal” which must then be adapted, proportioned, graduated to the so-called concrete possibilities of man…. But of which man are we speaking? Of man dominated by lust or of man redeemed by Christ? This is what is at stake: the reality of Christ’s redemption. Christ has redeemed us. This means that he has given us the possibility of realizing the entire truth of our being; he has set our freedom free from the domination of concupiscence. (103)\nUnlike Pope Francis, Pope John Paul II believed, as the Church has always believed, that the redeemed person, despite his weakness, is quite capable of living out the demands of the Gospel and achieving the “entire truth of his being.” That truth means that sexual relations ordered to procreation are the exclusive privilege of a married man and woman who are “no longer two but one” (Matthew 19:5).\nThe pope’s allies like Archbishop Paglia have referred to Amoris Laetitia as a paradigm shift, and this exuberant claim is not just hyperbole. As such, it not only opens the door for sacrileges like the blessing of same-sex relationships. In the words of Italian philosopher Augusto Del Noce, it also ushers in a transition from “ascetic Christianity” to a more “secularized” Christianity. The latter will slowly lead to a complete reversal of Catholic teaching on sexuality that is affirmed so clearly in the Gospel. As Del Noce points out, this new permissive attitude wipes away from the horizon the “passive and mortifying virtues” such as chastity and purity. These private virtues are now considered “repressive” even if Church authorities dare not explicitly admit this.\nGiven the impaired theology proposed by Pope Francis in Amoris Laetitia, it is no surprise that he does not meet with groups like Courage, which call active homosexuals to live a life of chastity. He prefers, instead, to support the work of Dignity and New Ways Ministry, which make no such demands on their followers. The pope has also spoken several times about our excessive preoccupation with “sins below the waist.” In an\ninterview with the Portuguese Jesuits during World Youth Day, the pope lamented that the Church still looks at the so-called “sins of the flesh” with a “magnifying glass,” while other evils—such as exploitation of workers, lying, and cheating—are minimized. The implication is that political virtues should take priority over the private ones.\nBut is the pope right about his apparent rejection of ascetic Christianity and the ostracizing of virtues like chastity and purity? And was the Church’s magisterium so wrong until Pope Francis in preserving and promoting those virtues as integral to the Faith and to our salvation?",

    "text": "Fuente: Latina Noticias Los fieles católicos peruanos respondieron a la convocatoria del arzobispo de Lima, Carlos Castillo , y se unieron a una cadena de oración nacional para pedir por la recuperación del papa Francisco, quien recibe tratamiento por una neumonía bilateral. La iniciativa, lanzada este martes, ha movilizado a cientos de devotos en diversas iglesias del país, especialmente en la Iglesia Las Nazarenas, lugar que acogió al pontífice durante su última visita a Perú.\nUno de los asistentes a la cadena de oración se declaró en incertidumbre por el estado de salud del papa: “Estamos preocupados por él”, dijo en diálogo con Latina Noticias . Otra feligresa, proveniente de Arequipa , agregó: “He llegado recién y me voy a sumar a esta cadena de oración”.\nManuel Orrillo Peña , exmayordomo general de la Hermandad del Señor de los Milagros de Nazarenas, compartió con cariño una anécdota de su encuentro con el papa Francisco durante su visita al país entre el 18 y el 21 de enero de 2018, un viaje apostólico incluyó las ciudades de Lima y Puerto Maldonado.\nFue la tercera vez que un pontífice visitó Perú, luego de las visitas de Juan Pablo II en 1985 y 1988. El viaje fue precedido por una visita a Chile, donde el papa recorrió Santiago, Temuco e Iquique.\nFuente: Latina Noticias “Estaba con la réplica del Señor de los Milagros en plata. Él me miró y me dijo: ‘Ya está bendecido’. Y me preguntó si era para mí. Y me dijo: ‘Bello, bello’. En otro momento me preguntó: ‘¿Vos sabés por qué los peruanos tomamos tanto?‘”, recordó Orrillo, quien también mostró imágenes del papa bendiciendo un solideo que llevó como recuerdo, junto con un solapero que le obsequió.\nFrancisco llegó a la Iglesia Las Nazarenas en su último día en Lima y pidió a las religiosas que lo acompañaron que rezaran por los más necesitados y por la unidad de la Iglesia peruana, la cual, según él, está “tentada de desunión”. En ese encuentro, también encomió la unidad de la Iglesia y sus agentes pastorales.\n“El demonio es mentiroso y, además, es chismoso, busca dividir, quiere que en la comunidad unas hablen mal de las otras”, dijo. Luego pidió: “Recen por la Iglesia, por los pastores, por los consagrados, por las familias, por los que sufren, por los que hacen daño, por los que explotan a sus hermanos. Y no se olviden, por favor, de rezar por mí”.\nA través de un mensaje difundido en plataformas sociales, el monseñor Castillo invitó a todos los párrocos, superiores mayores, rectores de iglesias, religiosos, miembros de institutos de vida consagrada, hermandades, movimientos eclesiales, directores de colegios y fieles de la Arquidiócesis de Lima a unirse a la cadena de oración. También hizo un llamado a los movimientos laicales, hermandades, cofradías, comisiones pastorales, catequistas y jóvenes para que participen con sus iniciativas y el rezo del Santo Rosario.\nFOTO DE ARCHIVO: El Papa Francisco habla durante un encuentro con la dirección, el personal y los pacientes del Hospital Infantil Bambino Gesu con motivo del centenario de la donación del hospital a la Santa Sede, en el Aula Pablo VI del Vaticano.

A sus 88 años, la enfermedad ha causado preocupación, pero continúa desempeñando sus funciones, consciente de las opciones que tiene.\nEn sus doce años de papado, que cumplirá el 13 de marzo, Jorge Bergoglio ha sido sometido a una operación para extirpar parte de su colon y a una intervención por una hernia abdominal. De igual modo, fue tratado por bronquitis en el hospital Gemelli durante los inviernos.\nSegún el Vaticano, la pasada noche ha sido “tranquila”. Por la mañana desayuna y lee algunos periódicos, pero pese a que debe guardar “reposo absoluto”, también recibe a sus secretarios para seguir revisando documentos.",
