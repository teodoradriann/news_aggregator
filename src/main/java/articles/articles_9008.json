    "text": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump urged Christians on Thursday to support him in the 2024 presidential election, a contest he depicted in religious terms and likened to the great battles of World War Two.\nSpeaking at a forum for Christian broadcasters in Nashville, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination compared the stakes for the election to D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge and said God's involvement was needed to rescue the country.\n\"Today we are in another struggle for survival of our nation,\" Trump told the event organized by the National Religious Broadcasters association. \"This time the greatest threat is not from the outside of our country, I really believe this: it's from within.\"\n\"I am here today because I know that to achieve victory in this fight, just like in the battles of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord, and the grace of Almighty God.\"\nSince launching his campaign in late 2022, Trump has regularly painted the state of the country in apocalyptic terms, seeking to undermine President Joe Biden's support ahead of a likely rematch for the White House.\nAPPEALING TO CHRISTIAN BASE\nTrump has at times sought to portray the choice facing Americans in November as one of good versus evil, couching his rhetoric in language that appeals to the conservative Christian voters who form a core of his support base.\nConservative Christian voters credit Trump for a series of policy victories including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion.\nThe thrice-married Trump has retained that support even as faces a criminal trial next month in New York that stems from alleged hush money paid to a porn star. It is one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump, who has derided them all as politically motivated.\n\"I'm a very proud Christian, actually,\" Trump said. \"I've been very busy fighting and, you know, taking the bullets, taking the arrows. I'm taking them for you and I'm so honored to take them, you have no idea.\"\nCalling the prosecutors \"bad people,\" Trump attempted to create common cause with his audience by raising fears that the Biden administration was planning to go after Christians and their organizations - despite a lack of evidence to support such an assertion.\n\"Christians, they can't afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight,\" Trump said. \"The radical left is coming after all of us because they know that our allegiance is not to them. Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator.\"\nThe former president's appearance in the Tennessee capital is no coincidence. The state is one of many holding primaries and caucuses on \"Super Tuesday\" on March 5, the biggest day of nominating contests.\nTrump is far ahead of Nikki Haley, his sole challenger in the Republican race. He is favored by 30 percentage points in South Carolina's first-in-the-South primary on Saturday, according to the polling average maintained by website FiveThirtyEight.\nIn his speech, Trump referred to people imprisoned for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as \"hostages,\" repeating language he has used several times as a way to embrace his supporters involved in the riot.\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Charleston, South Carolina, and Tim Reid in Washington; Editing by William Mallard)\nBy Nathan Layne and Tim Reid\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Bitcoin Price Today: BTC Price up 40% this month and 120% year-to-date, sparking optimism with some analysts predicting a rise to $180K by 2025. Bitcoin Price Dropping Today: Despite the bullish trend, Bitcoin faces risks, with the market showing signs of extreme greed, potentially signaling a correction and short-term drops of 6-10%. Bitcoin’s price has been on a tear, surging over 40% this month alone, cementing a remarkable 120% year-to-date gain. From its 2022 cycle lows, it has skyrocketed nearly 500%, fueling excitement across the crypto community. With the upcoming U.S. election and institutional interest heating up, including BlackRock’s engagement, the market appears euphoric, sparking questions on whether the rally will be sustained. Let’s dive into the video analysis by Altcoin Daily on BTC’s current market status and what the experts think. Bitcoin’s Bullish Case: $180K in Sight? According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s current rally may just be heating up, with no significant technical resistance ahead. Some analysts, including VanEck’s head of digital asset research, predict repeated all-time highs over the next two quarters. They argue that with strong government support, increasing institutional interest, and Bitcoin potentially being adopted as a reserve asset, the cryptocurrency could reach as high as $180,000 by 2025. This would represent a massive 1,000% return from the cycle’s bottom—a smaller percentage than previous cycles but still significant. Moreover, key indicators such as increased governmental support, favorable regulatory shifts, and large institutions considering crypto investments continue to drive optimism. With Gary Gensler potentially stepping down from the SEC and pro-crypto sentiment rising among U.S. leadership, more capital could flow into Bitcoin, potentially pushing its value higher. Crypto Crash Concerns: Should You Sell? Despite the bullish sentiment, there are concerns about a potential pullback. The market is showing signs of euphoria, which historically precedes corrections. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently shows a reading of 88, signaling ‘Extreme Greed’ in the market. Historically, when greed reaches these levels, the market tends to correct sharply. In April, for instance, a similar spike in greed led to an 18% drop in Bitcoin’s price within three weeks. On this note, Bitcoin’s rally has been strong, but experts caution that volatility will remain a factor, with short-term corrections of 6-10% likely along the way. Some skeptics believe the current rally may have already reached its peak. Indicators like Google searches for Bitcoin and Coinbase app rankings remain far below 2017 levels, suggesting retail participation is not as intense as during previous cycles. Plus, with a frothy market and speculative trading activity increasing, the possibility of a temporary crash cannot be ruled out. What do you think, a crash or rally on cards? Tell us.",

    "text": "World News in Brief: Dozens killed in Mali ‘summary executions’, Ukraine update, civilian protection in DR Congo, Haiti human rights UN human rights chief Volker Türk [expressed his shock on Thursday ](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2024/02/un-human-rights-chief-appalled-alleged-summary-executions-mali)at credible reports alleging that Malian armed forces and foreign military personnel executed at least 25 people last week. The alleged massacre happened in Welingara village in the Nara region of central Mali on 26 January. Some 30 civilians were also reportedly killed by unidentified gunmen in the Bandiagara region at the weekend. In his call for impartial investigations into the allegations, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights emphasized the need for justice in accordance with international standards. ‘Agents and allies’ Mr. Türk also urged the Malian authorities to ensure that their troops – “as well as their agents or allies” – adhered to human rights law and international humanitarian law, particularly regarding the protection of civilians. A fact-finding report from the UN human rights office, [OHCHR](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx), released last May in relation to allegations of a massacre of over 500 people in the village of Moura in March 2022, documented witnesses who described “armed white men” fighting alongside Malian soldiers. This report followed allegations made a year ago by independent UN rights experts that the Russia-based Wagner mercenary group had been involved, describing a “climate of terror and impunity” surrounding the military contractors’ activities in Mali. OHCHR has previously verified two other incidents involving the alleged killings of at least 31 civilians by Malian armed forces and “allied foreign military personnel” last September and October. In the September killings, 14 herders were allegedly executed in Ndoupa in the Segou region while on 5 October, 17 civilians were reportedly executed in Ersane village in the Gao region. No official investigations into these incidents have been reported, OHCHR noted. Deaths, injuries and destruction continues in Ukraine-Russia war New attacks in eastern Ukraine on Thursday have led to injuries and damage to civilian infrastructure, the UN Spokesperson told reporters in New York on Thursday. A hospital in Kharkiv was damaged in an attack on Wednesday, with several injured and many evacuated, according to Ukraine’s national rescue service, he said. A health facility also sustained damages in Toretsk, in the Donetsk region, as reported by the regional administration. “In frontline areas, our humanitarian colleagues note that the continued hostilities in the Donetsk and Kherson regions of Ukraine are continuing to kill and injure civilians. Homes, education facilities, public transport, water, electricity and [heating] facilities have also been damaged,” he continued, citing local authorities. A humanitarian hub run by a local non-governmental organization (NGO) in Kherson was also hit on Thursday. “Despite the challenges of operating in frontline areas, aid organizations continue to provide assistance,” the UN Spokesperson said. “In recent days, we, along with our humanitarian partners, have provided emergency repair materials as well as [psychological] and legal support in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions.” Peacekeepers provide new humanitarian corridor in DR Congo Peacekeepers are “continuing to do their utmost to protect civilians” in the North Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) amid ongoing clashes between the M23 rebel group and Congolese armed forces. That’s [according to](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/ossg/noon-briefing-highlight) UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, who reminded correspondents at the regular Noon Briefing that the UN Stabilization Mission, [MONUSCO](https://monusco.unmissions.org/en), has established a temporary presence in Mweso following clashes in the area of North Kivu. “Peacekeepers have also created a humanitarian corridor, which has allowed more than 1,000 displaced men, women and children to move to safer ground”, he said. The UN Mission is continuing to protect and provide medical assistance to displaced communities taking refuge near its base in Kitchanga, which is about 15 kilometres from Mweso, Mr. Dujarric said. The mission said it had helped evacuate eight Congolese soldiers to Goma who had been wounded in the fighting with the M23. The UN will monitor the situation closely, he added. MONUSCO is due to withdraw completely from DRC at the request of the government by the end of 2024, but while ‘blue helmets” may be withdrawing, the UN has repeatedly said that it will continue providing support to the Congolese people in the long-term. Haiti: UN human rights report shows spike in violence The last quarter of 2023 [saw another rise in violence](https://binuh.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/quarterly_report_on_the_human_rights_situation_in_haiti_oct_-_dec_2023.pdf) across Haiti, with reports of 2,327 victims of murder, wounding and kidnapping, marking an eight per cent increase compared to the previous three months. That’s according to the latest quarterly update from the UN integrated office in the crisis-wracked Caribbean island nation, [BINUH](https://binuh.unmissions.org/en). The total number of recorded victims for the year was more than 8,400. Much of the rise is due to violence at the hands of organized crime gangs, particularly in the Artibonite and the southern outskirts of the capital, with an upsurge in sexual violence recorded in several areas. UN Special Representative and Head of BINUH, Maria Isabel Salvador, stressed that this violence is fuelling chronic insecurity and undermining social stability. The report also reveals the serious impact on children, with at least 53 child victims of violence or other crimes. It also highlights the threat to humanitarian aid on the roads due to gang control of highways. The judicial system has also been impacted although there are some signs of improvement, including a reduction in pre-trial detention. During the quarter, 400 cases were processed resulting in the release of more than 258 people. However, there has been a rise in police casualties, highlighting persistent insecurity, BINUH said. The report calls on the international community to keep Haiti high on its agenda and support the implementation of the planned Multinational Security Support Mission for Haiti. © UN News UN News](https://news.un.org/feed/view/en/story/2024/02/1146147)",
