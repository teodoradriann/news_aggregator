    "text": "“What could be so bad that you won’t even let me see it?” asks Simone Zimmerman, the protagonist of Israelism, an acclaimed new documentary examining changing Jewish attitudes toward Israel. This rhetorical question is posed at Israelism’s climax. As Zimmerman shares the personal journey that led to challenging her pro-Israel upbringing and co-founding IfNotNow, she laments the refusal of Jewish leaders to engage with what was, literally, on the other side of the wall. Israelism has made waves worldwide in recent months, with screenings across many major cities and college campuses. IfNotNow’s Toronto chapter hosted a sold-out screening in December, and, by popular demand, is co-hosting two more this month along with Independent Jewish Voices (IJV). But some people don’t want you to see this film. Earlier this week, my phone flooded with screenshots of a Jewish Toronto Facebook group. Our event information had been posted, and angry members were calling the venue demanding our screening be cancelled. As Plan B, they conspired to buy-out tickets in order to “prevent impressionable young people” from seeing it. This reaction was predictable; Israelism screenings have been publicly cancelled and un-cancelled at least [four times](https://forward.com/culture/film-tv/573796/israelism-israel-palestine-documentary-campus-antisemtism/) since October 7th. Although efforts to suppress nuanced discussion of Israel-Palestine are not new, there is an eerie irony to this particular backlash: the film itself is a cautionary tale about the effect of one-sided Israel education on young Jews. — At its core, Judaism has always been about questioning authority. The Talmud, one of our most sacred texts, is itself a series of debates and disagreements on theology, political life, and moral code. In this light, showing Israelism is not radical, nor is it a departure from historical Jewish teachings; it falls firmly within our tradition of critical thought. Rather than telling a sanitized story about the state of Israel that all but erases Palestinians, the film asks that we open our minds to weighing multiple truths and paths forward, just as our Talmudic sages did. Of course, the pushback against Israelism is not rooted in biblical sanctity, but is being justified in the name of “Jewish safety”. Each screening cancellation and subsequent media frenzy has relied on this erroneous narrative, despite a widespread understanding [that our safety is intertwined with that of our Palestinian cousins and with other marginalized groups.](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/violence-against-palestinians-will-never-make-jewish-people-safe/article_fbe130d5-05ce-529c-b804-89ac70403d24.html) When these agitators cite [safety concerns](https://rabble.ca/human-rights/we-cannot-police-our-way-out-of-antisemitism/), they are not only referring to actual antisemitism, but rather to anything that threatens the positioning of Israel as central to Jewish life. They fear that showing this film to “impressionable young people” will ignite a generational disenchantment with Israel – but this unravelling is already happening. — In recent years, synagogues in Toronto have struggled to [retain young people](https://thecjn.ca/news/beth-tzedec-membership/). Beyond rising secularism and pandemic hiatuses, dissent around Israel is a major driver of generational disaffiliation from mainstream Judaism. A group of my friends even revoked their lifelong memberships at Toronto’s oldest synagogue due to its refusal to discuss the Occupation. Increasingly alienated from established Jewish institutions, Toronto Jews have been building flourishing community spaces rooted in ritual, drawing on our ancient teachings like teshuvah (repentance) and tzedek (justice) [specifically to reject Zionism as a litmus test for Jewishness.](https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/the-new-jewish-left) Engagement in these progressive spaces has soared in recent months – IfNotNow Toronto’s membership has tripled since October, while IJV’s has doubled. There is an undeniable hunger for Jewish community that is not bound to cultural tribalism or Zionist fairytales, but that holds complexity, advocates pluralism, and encourages critical thought. — So, in a way, those agitators are right: the more information people get, the more a reorganization of Jewish institutional life becomes inevitable. But evading these discussions is no longer possible whether or not IfNotNow and IJV’s Israelism screening is cancelled. Young Jews are searching for better answers.

    "text": "By Tatiana Krisztina & Victoria Johns ,\n2 hours ago Amid the ongoing drama with Justin Baldoni , pop sensation Taylor Swift appears to be distancing herself from Blake Lively, according to sources\nBlake, 37, and Justin, 40, both stars of It Ends With Us, have been caught up in a heated legal dispute since the Gossip Girl star accused her co-star of sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment on the set of the popular Colleen Hoover adaptation. In a recent development, Justin, who also directed the film, has launched a counter-lawsuit against Blake, making a series of shocking allegations .\nIn his $400 million lawsuit filed earlier this month, Justin claims an unnamed A-list celebrity, believed to be Swift due to her mention in related text messages, pressured him to \"comply with Blake's direction for the script\" during a meeting at Blake's house. This follows an incident where Blake reportedly complained to Justin.\nREAD MORE: Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's It Ends With Us lawsuits set for March 2026 trial date\nREAD MORE: Justin Baldoni admits he's a 'flawed man' as he releases bombshell voicemail amid Blake Lively feud\nAccording to the lawsuit, Justin reportedly texted Blake praising her revisions to a scene as \"so much more fun and interesting,\" but cheekily noted he \"would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor,\" followed by a playful emoji. In response, Blake allegedly likened herself to the iconic Game of Thrones character Khaleesi, referring to Reynolds and Swift as her two \"dragons.\"\nHer purported message read: \"I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually for better,\" and continued, \"Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. [Smiley-face emoji] you will too, I can promise you,\" reports the Mirror .\nTaylor and Blake have had a close relationship over the years, with Taylor interweaving Blake's children Betty, Inez, and James into her songs. The songstress also took Blake with her to the Super Bowl last year as they cheered on Taylor's beau Travis Kelce, who was competing in the championship.\nBut it seems like Blake might not be joining Taylor at this Super Bowl, as sources claim that Taylor is trying to distance herself from the ongoing drama. An insider told the Daily Mail : \"For the time being she is taking a step back from Blake because she doesn’t want to get tangled in this more than she already has – which is far more than she ever needed to be.\"\nThe controversy, which erupted in 2023, is believed to have originated from Blake's alterations to the rooftop scene in their romantic drama, It Ends With Us. Despite receiving support from her husband Ryan and close friend Taylor, not everyone was on board with the changes, as evidenced by text messages from April 2023 included in the $400 million lawsuit against Blake.\nThe aftermath reportedly extended for several days, prompting Justin to feel \"obliged\" to text his co-star in an attempt at reconciliation. The complaint revealed Blake's comprehensive text response, where she allegedly conveyed: \"They [Reynolds and Swift] also know I'm not always good at making sure I'm seen and utilized for fear of threatening egos, or fear of affecting the ease of the process.\"\n\"They don't give a s*** about that. And because of that, everyone listens to them with immense respect and enthusiasm. So I guess I have to stop worrying about people liking me.\"\n4",

Dominique Meyer et Bernard Arnault accèdent quant à eux au cercle prestigieux des grand'croix, plus haute dignité de la Légion d'honneur. Onze personnes intervenues lors de l'attentat d'Arras (Pas-de-Calais) le 13 octobre, six policiers et cinq personnels du lycée Gambetta, sont faites chevaliers dans la promotion de la Légion d'honneur du 1er janvier, publiée dimanche au Journal officiel. Le professeur [Dominique Bernard](/p/dominique-bernard), [poignardé à mort devant son collège-lycée d'Arras](/faits-divers-justice/2023/12/21/attentat-d-arras-l-assaillant-son-frere-et-son-cousin-interroges-par-un-juge) par un ancien élève radicalisé, avait lui été élevé à titre posthume au grade de chevalier par la présidence de la République, aussitôt après cette attaque. Au total, la nouvelle promotion civile de la Légion d'honneur, la plus élevée des distinctions nationales françaises, récompense « à parité » 352 personnes œuvrant « au service de l'intérêt général », précise la Grande chancellerie dans un communiqué. Illustres ou inconnues du grand public, ces personnes sont réparties en différents grades (chevaliers, officiers, commandeurs...). [Bernard Arnault](/p/bernard-arnault) distingué Deux rejoignent le cercle prestigieux des grand'croix, plus haute dignité de la Légion d'honneur détenue par seulement 68 autres personnes: l'hématologue Dominique Meyer, membre de l'Académie des sciences, et le PDG du numéro un mondial du luxe LVMH, Bernard Arnault. Toujours dans les sciences, deux lauréats du prix Nobel de physique 2023, le Français Pierre Agostini et la Franco-Suédoise Anne L'Huillier, sont promus commandeurs, tout comme le spationaute Jean-François Clervoy et le pédopsychiatre Marcel Rufo. Dans le monde économique, sont récompensés Jean-Michel Darrois, avocat d'affaires, Colette Lewiner, administratrice d'EDF et du groupe parapétrolier CGG, ainsi que David de Rothschild, président d'honneur de la banque R&CO, tous trois promus grand officier. Les ministres et parlementaires en exercice ne peuvent être nommés, mais l'ancien ministre centriste Jean-Louis Borloo est promu officier, et l'ancienne ministre du gouvernement Castex Elisabeth Moreno, présidente de Femmes@Numérique, devient chevalier. Des personnalités sportives à l'honneur L'ambassadeur de France en Iran Nicolas Roche, ancien directeur de cabinet de [Jean-Yves Le Drian](/p/jean-yves-le-drian) lorsqu'il était ministre des Affaires étrangères, est fait aussi chevalier. Dans le domaine sportif, Michel Vion, secrétaire général de la Fédération internationale de ski, est fait officier, tandis que David Lappartient, président du Comité national olympique et sportif français (CNOSF), [Marion Bartoli](/p/marion-bartoli), consultante sportive, Patrick Haddad, président du Red Star Football Club et producteur audiovisuel, [Marc Keller](/p/marc-keller), président du Racing Club de Strasbourg, ainsi que Frédéric Michalak, entraîneur au Racing 92 en rugby, rejoignent les chevaliers. Pour les arts, le compositeur Vladimir Cosma est notamment promu officier. La promotion dite du 1er janvier et celle du 14 juillet sont les deux promotions civiles annuelles de la Légion d'honneur, qui compte désormais quelque 79 000 membres. Deux promotions militaires sont également publiées, l'une en juin-juillet pour l'armée d'active, l'autre en octobre-novembre pour les militaires de réserve et les anciens combattants. En 2023, 1 858 personnes ont ainsi été distinguées.",

    "title": "Faulty power cable may have caused Greece’s worst wildfire this year, sources say",
    "text": "By Renee Maltezou and Yannis Souliotis\nATHENS (Reuters) – Investigators suspect a faulty power cable may have caused Greece’s worst wildfire this year, said sources close to a probe over the blaze that killed one woman and torched 10,000 hectares near Athens, covering a total area about the size of Paris.\nThe blaze, which began on Aug. 11, broke out from a forest off Varnavas town, 35 km (22 miles) from the capital and into Athens’ northern suburbs, some of which had never seen a wildfire before, within a day.\nAuthorities have questioned Varnavas residents as part of their investigation into what caused the blaze. A 76-year old man said a wooden electricity pillar outside his home, which had a loose cable fastened to it with a hanger, could have triggered it, officials said.\nThat scenario was the leading one in the probe, which should be concluded over the coming months, an official with knowledge of the investigation said. Arson was also being considered.\nA fire brigade official who declined to be named said an area close to the electricity pole had been determined as the starting point of the blaze.\nWildfires have been a common feature of Greek summers for years, with many attributed to voluntary or involuntary arson, short-circuits or occasionally, to natural causes. The country registered more than 8,000 forest fires in 2023.\nIn recent years, the risk of such fires has been raised by climate change, which has brought hotter weather and less rain.\nA prosecutor has deployed engineers to look into the latest wildfire’s cause.\nGreece’s power network operator HEDNO, said it had found no evidence of a malfunction.\n“We have no indication that anything wrong such as a short-circuit happened,” an official at HEDNO told Reuters adding that only the relevant authorities were responsible for determining the fire’s cause.\nLocal media cited residents who had heard explosions before the fire broke out. Others said there were initially two fires.\nMilder winds have calmed the blaze which covered a distance of 40 kilometres (24.85 miles) before reaching the Athens’ suburbs of Penteli and Vrilissia, where one woman was killed.\nStill, flare-ups were possible, officials have warned, as winds are expected to pick up again.\nSunday’s fast moving fire broke out amid a week-long high fire risk alert due to high temperatures and gale force winds.\nGreece had its warmest winter on record this year and was on track for its hottest summer with scant rain in many areas, a recipe for fire disasters, according to firefighters.\n“The fire started very far from here, probably from a power line and in no time it burned everything,” 78-year old Varnavas resident Giannis Tsiminis told Reuters on Wednesday.\n(This story has been refiled to change the attribution to ‘sources,’ not ‘investigators,’ in the headline)\n(Reporting by Yannis Souliotis and Renee Maltezou; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

    "text": "Valentina Raffio\nBarcelona 01 NOV 2024 12:48 El Servei Meteorològic de Cataluña ha activado decenas de avisos amarillos y naranja ante el riesgo de que la DANA que esta semana ha azotado España siga dejando lluvias torrenciales en el territorio durante los próximos días. Los pronósticos apuntan a que el temporal se seguirá extendiendo hasta como mínimo el domingo , por lo que se han activado varios avisos ante la posibilidad de que las lluvias dejen más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado en algunos puntos del litoral catalán. Por el momento, las zonas con más riesgo se concentran en el extremo sur, incluyendo el Tarragonès, el Baix Camp, el Priorat, Ribera d'Ebre, Terra Alta, Baix Ebre y Montsià. En Barcelona, se ha activado un aviso amarillo para viernes, sábado y domingo .\nEste viernes hay siete comarcas catalanas en alerta naranja por el paso de esta DANA . En el Montsià, Baix Ebre y Terra Alta, hay activo un aviso naranja por acumulación de lluvias en tanto que podrían superarse los 100 litros por metro cuadrado a lo largo de la jornada. También destaca otra alerta naranja por intensidad de las lluvias en toda la zona (desde el Tarragonès hasta el Baix Camp, el Priorat, Ribera d'Ebre), dado que entre este mediodía y la tarde podrían producirse descargas de hasta 40 litros en tan solo 30 minutos. En todas estas zonas, las autoridades piden a los residentes extremar las precauciones durante la jornada de este viernes.\nEn Barcelona se ha activado un aviso amarillo para viernes, sábado y domingo Este viernes también hay 14 comarcas más en alerta amarilla : el Barcelonès, Baix Llobregat, Vallès Occidental, Garraf, Alt Penedès, Anoia, Alt Camp, Baix Penedès, Conca de Barberà, Segarra, Urgell, Garrigues, Pla d'Urgell y Segrià. El aviso se extiende para toda la jornada del viernes y, en varios casos, también de cara al sábado. En estos puntos se esperan precipitaciones abundantes que en algunos casos podrían adquirir un carácter torrencial. Según datos de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, en el litoral y prelitoral de Barcelona se podrían registrar acumulaciones de hasta 20 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora.\nCinco comunidades en alerta En el conjunto de España, este viernes hay cinco comunidades autónomas en alerta por el paso de la DANA y al menos un aviso rojo activado en el litoral de Huelva , donde se podrían dar acumulaciones de más de 140 litros por metro cuadrado en tan solo unas horas. En localidades como Cartaya ya se han acumulado más de 117 litros por metro cuadrado en menos de tres horas, de los cuales 70 en un hora. También se están registrando importantes trombas marinas asociadas a este evento.\nEl domingo hay avisos amarillos activados para todo el litoral y prelitoral catalán Los pronósticos sobre la evolución de esta DANA aún son inciertos pero, según los modelos más actualizados, todo apunta a que el temporal seguirá abriéndose paso durante el fin de semana . El domingo, de hecho, el Servei Meteorològic de Cataluña ha activado un aviso amarillo en todo el litoral y prelitoral catalán , desde el Alt Empordà hasta les Terres de l'Ebre, por intensidad de lluvias. Para entonces hay casi una veintena de comarcas en aviso amarillo y tres más, situadas en el extremo sur, en aviso naranja.\nTEMAS",
