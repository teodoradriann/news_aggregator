    "title": "Nifty Struggles Below 25,000: SEBI RAs Signal Range-bound Moves Until A Clear Breakout",
    "text": "The Nifty continues to show fatigue at higher levels. Analysts caution traders to adopt a level-based strategy amid expiry volatility on Thursday.\nThe Nifty remained subdued for another session on Wednesday, ending below the 24,900 level.\nSEBI-registered analyst Mayank Singh Chandel observed that the index ended the day forming a small-bodied candle with a long upper shadow, which is a sign of selling pressure at higher levels.\nFrom a technical standpoint, he noted that the index now shows signs of a lower top formation around 24,982. This pattern, especially after multiple failed attempts near the 25,000–25,200 resistance zone, suggests short-term weakness or a potential consolidation phase.\nChandel adds that the 24,700–24,750 zone is a crucial intraday support area. A decisive close below 24,700 could expose the index to a deeper correction toward the 24,500–24,450 range.\nOn the upside, fresh momentum will only emerge if Nifty manages a strong move and closes above 25,000, which could open the door to a rally towards 25,200 and possibly 25,500.\nThe stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the edge of a breakout but has yet to confirm upside traction, while the MACD histogram continues to weaken, suggesting a lack of bullish momentum.\nOn the derivatives front, he highlighted that Call writers dominate at 25,000 and 24,800, establishing immediate resistance. Put writers hold ground at 24,750 and 24,500, making these levels key support zones.\nAdding that the maximum Open Interest on the Put side is still at 24,000: a broader safety net for bulls. Chandel flags key resistance levels at 24,900,25,000, and 25,200, with support at 24,750, 24,700, and 24,500.\nHe cautions that until a decisive breakout or breakdown occurs, expect continued range-bound price action between 24,500 and 25,200. Chandel advises intraday traders to maintain a level-based approach, while positional traders can wait for confirmation above 25,000 or below 24,700 for directional plays.\nBharat Sharma of Stockace Financial Services noted that the index settled with its daily candle forming a green hammer, indicating mixed signals for Thursday’s trading session.\nSharma maintains his stance that the market will continue to trade in a defined range of 25,100-24,500 for a few more days before any decisive breakout in either direction. Given the consolidation over the last month, he sees a probability of a positive breakout, provided there are no negative developments.\nFor the intraday session, he warns traders to be cautious given the weekly expiry on Thursday. On the 15-minute chart, he noted a Descending Flag Formation over the last four days, which, if activated by breaching 24,900, could lead to a 100-200 point upside.\nOn the flip side, a lack of momentum from the 24,800-24,760 level will likely lead to an intensive fall. Sharma pegs the next immediate support at 24,700-24,650-24,580-24,500.\nHe sees immediate resistance between 24,850-24,880, with a sustained move above 24,900 possibly setting the stage for the Nifty index to retest 25,000 and above.\nOn the options data, he cautions that slightly elevated At-the-money (ATM) straddle premiums indicate the possibility of significant moves, if premiums do not erode in the first hour of trading.\nMeanwhile, Front Wave Research maintains its neutral stance on the indices. They continue to track 24,985 on the Nifty as the key level for an upgrade and believe that a break above this with confirmation will mark the next phase for fresh longs.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<",

    "text": "Latto has dealt with her fair share of hate since breaking through as a mainstream superstar in 2022. Though many women in rap experience similar hate and it isn't QUITE as bad as someone like [Sexyy Red](/profile/sexyy-red), she still gets a lot of flak. So it's no surprise that every once in a while she had to remind her fans who exactly she is and why she has her platform. Overnight she dropped the tweet \"Who do y’all hoes be thinking y’all is lol\" which has since racked up over 8k likes. But it was a response to that original tweet that didn't sit right with Latto. A fan quote tweeted her original post and responded \"The same b*tch you think you is lol.\" The rapper quote tweeted that song directly with a pretty lethal response saying \"Well ima multi millionaire so.\" That wasn't even the final tweet she made on the matter either. Shortly afterward she hit the fan again with another tweet that said \"Y’all monkey see monkey do ass hoes so corny I’m still put up still pretty still having my way and what u got? A hit tweet?\" Check out a recap of the full interaction below.

[She teamed up with Luh Tyler](/745566-luh-tyler-latto-the-grinch-freestyle-single) for a hip hop flip of a Christmas classic. The two released the hilarious \"The Grinch\" freestyle last month. That collaboration came just a few weeks after she may have had some shots aimed at her by another rapper. That rapper is [Nicki Minaj](/profile/nickiminaj), who tried to start beef with multiple female rap contemporaries on her new album Pink Friday 2. That included [Megan Thee Stallion](/profile/megan-thee-stallion), Izzy Azalea, [and potentially even Latto too](/742719-nicki-minaj-diss-megan-thee-stallion-latto). Their issues are likely inherited from beef she had with [Ice Spice](/profile/ice-spice) earlier this year. What do you think of Latto's response to a fan trying to hate on her online?

    "title": "Harvey Weinstein's New York Conviction Was Overturned, But His Ass Will Remain In Prison",
    "text": "He's still serving a 16-year sentence for crimes committed in California. Some pretty unappealing news — on Thursday, in a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of Appeals overturned Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 New York conviction for rape and sexual assault. The reason has nothing to do with any particular question of his guilt, but rather with the fact that women whose accusations he was not charged with or convicted of testified at his trial. The women had been allowed to testify in order to establish a pattern of prior bad acts, but Weinstein’s attorneys argued that he was convicted based on these prior bad acts and not the evidence in the specific cases for which he was tried. Under our system of justice, the accused has a right to be held to account only for the crime charged and, thus, allegations of prior bad acts may not be admitted against them for the sole purpose of establishing their propensity for criminality (see People v Molineux). Nor may the prosecution use “prior convictions or proof of the prior commission of specific, criminal, vicious or immoral acts” other than to impeach the accused's credibility (People v Sandoval). It is our solemn duty to diligently guard these rights regardless of the crime charged, the reputation of the accused, or the pressure to convict (see Boyd v United States). It’s not easy to prosecute cases like this, where we are talking about things that happen behind closed doors and very purposely not in public, and where there is often not much evidence beyond personal testimonies — and when shame keeps people from coming forward before the statute of limitations is up. That is why prosecutors in this case relied on the other victims to demonstrate a pattern of behavior. Exciting! If we get 146 more paid subscribers, YOU get a week without faces like the horrible one above! One of the more disappointing aspects of this whole situation is that the 2015 case against Weinstein for the sexual assault of model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez was far more solid and included a recorded confession from Weinstein but his lawyers had been able to get the DA to dismiss it. Gutierrez was able to testify at Weinstein’s trial that he had groped her breasts and put his hand up his skirt, but he was not charged with any crimes against her. “If the D.A. had taken my case seriously in 2015, we wouldn’t be here,” Gutierrez said in a statement. “This is an ongoing failure of the justice system — and the courts — to take survivors seriously and to protect our interests.” It is very difficult, I think, to process this without “It’s Harvey Weinstein and he’s obviously a monster! We all know what he did!” in one’s head. It’s still important that even the obviously guilty get very, very fair trials and to get appeals when a trial was not fair, because we need that to be the case when the person is actually innocent. On the bright side, this is largely moot. Harvey Weinstein is in terrible health and currently serving a 16-year prison sentence for crimes he was convicted of in California in 2022. There is very little chance that he will not die in prison. He is not ever going to be a threat to anyone (outside of prison) ever again. Prosecutors say they have every intention of retrying the case against him. It is understandable that a lot of people are deeply disappointed and hurt by this — his victims in particular, but also victims of other, similar crimes. A lot of people are taking this as “a blow to the #MeToo movement” and to survivors in general. But absolutely no one is required to see this as “a blow to the #MeToo movement,” which was a great deal larger than Harvey Weinstein and which I certainly hope had a greater effect on society as a whole than on just one man being convicted of specific crimes and going to prison. It’s not a house of cards and removing this one thing doesn’t mean it is going to tumble to the ground. We now live in a society where women are less afraid to speak up and less likely to be judged for doing so, in which men like Harvey Weinstein have absolutely no reason to believe that their victims will keep their mouths shut and will therefore be less likely to even try it. That is a big, big deal. Especially because the biggest deterrent to crime is not harsh punishment but the certainty that one will be caught.",

    "text": "ST. GEORGE, Utah (KUTV) — Officials in the Washington County School District said that no child is left hungry, even if they don’t have money to pay for school lunch.\n“It is district policy that if kids get in line, we feed them,” said Stefenee Hymas, the district’s meal benefits secretary. “We are not allowed to discuss an account balance with the kids — we feed them if they get in line.\nThis approach comes as some families in the school district find themselves caught in a financial gray area. Federal guidelines for free and reduced-price lunches are based on strict income thresholds, leaving some families just over the limit but still struggling to make ends meet.\nFor a family of four, annual income must be below about $41,000 to qualify for free lunches and below $58,000 for reduced-price meals. With housing and utility costs continuing to climb in Washington County, many families earning above these limits still face financial strain.\nYuridia Pech, a mother of five whose children attend Washington County schools, said her family missed the cut off for reduced-price meals by just $19.\nShe said the district’s policy regarding feeding every child has been crucial during tough times.\n“It’s a relief knowing my kids can eat no matter what,” she said. “There are days where we are choosing between paying a bill or buying groceries. Knowing that they will get a meal at school is a relief.”\nFor families who do qualify for reduced-price meals, the district has gone beyond federal requirements by waving the remaining costs.\nNormally, families on the reduced-price plan pay $0.40 per lunch and $0.30 per breakfast. But, the district absorbs fees and instead gives this subsection of the population the entirely free meal plan.\nMORE on SCHOOL LUNCH DEBT IN UTAH: Gov. Cox redirects $1.2 million to program reimbursing school lunch debt Utah dad, lawmaker call for permanent solution to rising student lunch debt New push to reduce Utah's multi-million-dollar lunch debt Utah Board of Education to discuss budget priorities, considers school meal program bill Hymas said this cost the district’s child nutrition program roughly $100,000 last year. She said this decision was made to ease the burden on struggling families and reduce administrative costs.\n“We figured we’d make it up elsewhere,” she said. “It helps those who fall into that gap where they qualify for reduced meals but are still having a hard time.”\nDespite these efforts, not all families qualify for assistance, like Pech and her family.\nWhile the school will not turn a child away, they will start to accrue debt for each meal.\n“I have been scared before, wondering if this will be the day that they don’t get a meal,” Pech said. “Luckily, they’ve never been denied. But, the bill just kept racking up.\"\nFor those with unpaid balances, the district makes sure that is only known to the parents. Parents are notified directly about overdue payments, sometimes through repeated phone calls or emails.\n“I would just ask for leniency when it comes to school lunch debt. It’s already stressful and then to get texts, emails, and calls multiple times a week,\" Pech said. \"I’m already trying to pay my past due bills. Now, I’m worried about lunch too.\"\nSchool district officials said they have some programs and community donations to help offset the burden. Pech said she’s also received support from other moms in the community.\nPech would like to see all kids, regardless of income, receive hot meals at school.\n“Inmates get school, housing and free meals — why shouldn’t school children?” Pech asked.\nThe district said that this would likely be cost prohibitive, but they are open to it.\n___",

    "text": "By Jason Burgos ,\n1 hour ago Kadarius Toney already seemed like one of the worst trades the Kansas City Chiefs have made in years. He added to that narrative at the team’s practice on Wednesday.\nWhen the Chiefs made a trade deadline move for former Giants first-round pick Kadarius Toney in 2022, the deal was viewed as a steal. They gave up a third-round compensatory and sixth-round selection in 2023 for a player with a great deal of potential. But there were red flags as well.\nRelated: Kansas City Chiefs 2024 schedule, latest depth chart, stats and injury report\nThe Giants gave up on him after just a season and a half and the former Seminoles star also had issues staying healthy. The Chiefs have also found out that he can be inconsistent on the field and a bit of a problem off.\nHe made headlines in 2023 when superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes got publicly frustrated with Toney’s butter fingers during an important game in December that led to a turnover against the Patriots. Then a random tangent on social media about the team in January led to him being a surprising scratch in their AFC Title Game matchup with the Baltimore Ravens.\nEven during a season where the Kansas City Chiefs desperately needed a secondary receiving option, besides Travis Kelce, he could not elevate his game and was given just two starts in 2023. Toney is on a path to being a major draft bust from the 2021 NFL Draft.\nKadarius Toney stats (2024): 13 games, 27 catches, 169 yards, 1 touchdown\nHe only added to the narrative that he is a disappointment and one of the worst trades the team has made on Wednesday at their first practice of training camp. After taking a pass from Mahomes, Toney took a solid shot from defensive star George Karlaftis that knocked him to the ground.\nInstead of taking the moment in stride and realizing he is on thin ice after three underwhelming seasons in the league, Toney got up and violently threw the ball at Karlaftis. The receiver walked off the field while some players from the offense and defense jaw-jacked after the play.\nKadarius Toney could turn into a big part of a Kansas City Chiefs three-peat in 2024. However, it seems like he is still the player he has always been, and that is not a good sign for KC.\nRelated: Kansas City Chiefs turned down chance to sign 2x Pro Bowl receiver last season\nMore must-reads:\nHow To Watch the NFL Preseason in 2024 Dallas Cowboys provide update on CeeDee Lamb contract demands amid holdout Denver Broncos avoid holdout with Courtland Sutton, give star receiver a raise Expand All Read in NewsBreak",
