Image: SNS Group\nRoss County boss Derek Adams is confident a second successive call-off won’t affect his players as they seek to defeat Hearts at Tynecastle this weekend.\nLast Saturday’s home Premiership match against Hibs was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.\nThen, on Wednesday, with County stuck on the snowbound A9, the SPFL, aided by Police Scotland’s advice, opted to postpone their match against Rangers at Ibrox.\nIt means the Staggies have not played since their last-gasp 1-0 home defeat to Dundee on December 16.\nNow they prepare to face in-form Hearts at Tynecastle, fresh from the Jambos’ dramatic 1-0 derby win at Hibs, thanks to a winner from Lawrence Shankland.\nThe impact of Storm Gerrit on Wednesday caused major travel trouble throughout part of Scotland, with Aberdeen v Motherwell also called off.\nThe A9 was shut both ways due to heavy snowfall at the Drumochter and Dalwhinnie sections, with flooding soon after affecting the Ballinluig and Dunkeld areas.\nSteven Ferguson says A9 closure made it impossible for Ross County to continue journey for Rangers match\nAlthough Rangers and County wanted the game on, there was an agreement that safety came first for fans of both sides travelling as well as the visitors who were facing a losing battle to reach Glasgow.\nExtra training time was real positive Adams looked at the positive side of the situation as he gained extra training time on Thursday.\nHe said: “It was the correct decision (to postpone the match).\n“The league had to make that decision on Wednesday afternoon, because as we all know the A9 was closed for much of the day and it was going to be impossible not just for us to get to the game, but for supporters from both sides to get to the game.\n“It was the correct decision. We’re all disappointed the game was off, but there was no other decision the league could have made.\n“It’s just something that you have to deal with – it’s not too big of a problem.\n“We’ve been able to train in Dingwall, but from our point of view we’ve missed two games against Hibernian and Rangers.\n“What it has done is allow us some training time.”\nPlayers will be ready for hectic run With just 17 league matches played, only Aberdeen with 16, have played fewer fixtures than County, with games stacking up for after the winter break which follows this Tuesday’s clash between the north rivals in Dingwall.\nAdams says his players will relish rather than dread the packed schedule following their Scottish Cup tie against Partick Thistle on January 20.\nHe said: “We’re obviously going to go back into a period at the end of January and February where we’re playing on Saturdays and Tuesdays for a bit.\n“That will be nice, because the players probably enjoy that more than training.\n“We’ll get a period of rest from games for two and a half weeks, but we’ll be training hard in that period too.”\n🎟️ Tickets for Saturday's trip to face Heart of Midlothian are still available.\nPurchase here 👉 https://t.co/WWcxaUX49E pic.twitter.com/6VxKEafZNf\n— Ross County FC (@RossCounty) December 28, 2023\nCounty are keen to test hosts Hearts Shankland is hogging the headlines due to his goal exploits, but Hearts also have three clean sheets in a row as they sit third in the top-flight.\nAdams, however, backs County to ask questions of Steven Naismith’s side in the capital.\nHe said: “We have to go there and create opportunities, take the ball and get into that final third.\n“We obviously have to deal with the threat of not only Lawrence Shankland, but the other players who have done well for them this season.\n“They are third in the league for a reason, and they have done well in the league, and in Europe, over a number of seasons.”\nSeven-point haul so far for Adams Since Adams replaced Malky Mackay as the manager of County for his third spell in charge, they have taken seven points out of 15.\nA 0-0 draw against Kilmarnock preceded 1-0 and 3-0 wins over St Mirren and Motherwell .\nSt Mirren’s 2-0 win against County in Paisley was Adams’ first defeat since the start of his third spell in charge then the sore 1-0 loss to Dundee kept the Dingwall team on 17 points.",

    "title": "HISD Analyses the Teachers it Has Left",
    "text": "By Margaret Downing ,\n3 hours ago\nIf half of the 2,600 teachers who left Houston ISD in June and July were rated in the bottom two proficiency categories by the district is this a sign that they were bad teachers or that they just couldn’t get with Superintendent Mike Miles’ programs?\nShould parents breathe a sigh of relief or in some cases continue to question the policies of the new administration?\nAnd as to why the more highly rated teachers, including those judged to have turned in “exemplary” performances, quit their jobs with HISD, it’s not known. As explained by Jessica Neyman, HISD’s Chief Human Resources Officer at Thursday night’s school board meeting, the Miles administration is continuing the previous practice of leaving it up to the departing employees to ask for an exit interview.\nFor his part, Miles pointed to his data showing 83 percent of the higher rated teachers staying with the district as evidence that HISD is building a more proficient teacher force. \"The higher the instructional proficiency of the teachers, the higher the retention rate.\"\nThe departures were higher than historic numbers, 2,696 compared to 2,000, but he added that 1,400 of those teachers had been told they were being brought in for \"file review\" in the spring meaning they knew their continued job prospects weren't stellar. \"Most of those teachers decided to resign,\" Miles said, before going through that process.\nIn a power-packed evening there was a bond protest as well. It was another sometimes raucous and always lengthy board meeting complete with one group protesting the upcoming $4.4 billion bond election and another calling for answers in the aftermath of the August death of 14-year-old Landon Payton at Marshall Middle School while in gym class. Landon's father Alexis Payton, was joined by state Rep. Christina Morales and FIEL Executive Director Cesar Espinosa among others who stood during the meeting while holding a picture of Landon.\nPayton's family has still not been told of his cause of death, only that he suffered “a medical emergency.” The AED equipment was reportedly not working in his location which has led to an HISD review of AEDs throughout the district and discovering 170 inoperable units that it has said will be repaired. The family still doesn't know if a working defibrillator would have saved Landon. HISD has said that only medical officials can establish the cause of death.\nLater in the public speaking section of the evening, parent Anna Luzutiaga asked everyone to stand to remember the teenager in a moment of silence. While audience members rose, the board members and superintendent did not – which caused an immediate outcry.\nChanting Landon's name, while continuing to stand, the audience could not be interrupted. One audience member cursed which sparked a reprimand from Board President Audrey Momanaee who said children were watching the meeting from home. When the chanting continued, the board and Miles retreated to a back room right before 6 p.m. before returning at 6:07.\n\"This board supports the Payton family,\" Momanaee said upon their return. She then explained the need for order in school board meetings and repeated that the use of swear words could not be allowed.\nAn interesting note was struck when Miles discussed the district’s assessment of performance comparing non-certified teachers to certified ones. Data showed that a lower percentage of the non-certified – 42 percent — scored at the proficient and above level, while 66 percent of certified teachers were judged proficient or higher.\nIn the past, Miles has maintained that teachers should be judged on the job they too, rather than whether they are certified or not. At board meetings there have been continuous complaints from parents, students and educators about the district’s increasing use of non-certified teachers, contending that many of them are ill-equipped to handle a classroom.\nThursday, Miles acknowledged the important factors of experience and training in how effective teachers can be.\nHe touted an expansion of HISD’s own in-house certification program which allows the uncertified to work toward certification while teaching. He also referred to a Texas Tribune story which reported that districts all over the state are using more uncertified teachers, trying to fill their teacher ranks, calling it the new reality.\n\"This is a problem statewide and nationally,\" Miles said. For the forseeable future if we want to fill all of our positions, we will be hiring teachers who need a certification.\"\nAccording to the Texas Education Agency, 40 percent of new hires across the state in 2023-24 were uncertified. At charter schools it was 60 percent. At the same time, Miles reported that there were 8,000 applicants at the district’s job fairs for about 1,000 openings.\nAn analysis of the HISD retention patterns Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Super Eagles winger Moses Simon says the team is condemned to beat Benin in Saturday’s 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.\nRecall that Nigeria will be going for revenge after losing 2-1 to Benin in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier.\nSpeaking with NFFTV, the Nantes star stated that the Super Eagles will be desperate to overcome the Cheetah at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo, in a bid to put a smile on the faces of Nigerians.\n“I missed my Super Eagles teammates, and I am happy to be back to my roots. The mood was a little bit up because coach Eguavoen knows a lot of the players and the role they have to play.\nRead Also: AFCON 2025Q: Super Eagles Determined To Make Great Start — Eguavoen\n“He gave confidence to the players. He’s the coach, and we don’t know his tactics or how they will work. You can find the best players sitting on the bench. So I believe the coach knows better than we do. He has not been out of the team despite the fact that he’s not the coach. But he’s within the team because he’s working for the federation.\n“This is our job, and we know what is at stake. Of course, we lost against Benin 2-1, and I believe we don’t want another loss or a draw against them again. I know we always beat them, and this one won’t be an exemption. The guys know what they have to do to win. We are not going there for a draw or fighting a war.\n“We will approach the game with the sole aim of winning and put a smile on the faces of Nigerians. As a Nigerian, we always feel sad each time the team doesn’t win. Even though the players gave their best, their best may not be enough.”",

    "text": "\"Mufasa: O Rei Leão\" lidera bilheterias de Natal nos EUA\nAnimação da Disney reage e supera \"Sonic 3 - O Filme\" após desempenho fraco no fim de semana de estreia\nVirada nas bilheterias durante o Natal\n\"Mufasa: O Rei Leão\" conseguiu liderar as bilheterias de Natal nos Estados Unidos, arrecadando US$ 15 milhões na quarta-feira (25/12). O desempenho marca uma virada para o filme da Disney, que havia estreado com números fracos no fim de semana anterior, arrecadando quase metade do que \"Sonic 3 - O Filme\" conquistou no mesmo período.\nA animação agora projeta um total de US$ 50 milhões para o feriado prolongado, igualando a meta de \"Sonic 3 - O Filme\", mas a vantagem ainda é vista como incerta, de acordo com analistas, porque a adaptação de videogame da Paramount continua performando bem, em 2º lugar.\n\"Nosferatu\" supera expectativas\nEntre os destaques do feriado, o terror \"Nosferatu\", dirigido por Robert Eggers e estrelado por Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult e Bill Skarsgård, impressionou com US$ 11,6 milhões arrecadados na quarta-feira (25/12). A expectativa é que o filme alcance US$ 40 milhões até o domingo, bem acima das projeções iniciais, que apontavam US$ 20 milhões como meta.\nOutros lançamentos de destaque\nA cinebiografia de Bob Dylan, \"Um Completo Desconhecido\", com Timothée Chalamet, atraiu o público mais velho e arrecadou US$ 7,2 milhões. O drama de época deve encerrar o feriado com US$ 22 milhões, consolidando um forte início.\nOutro destaque é \"Babygirl\", estrelado por Nicole Kidman, que arrecadou US$ 1,7 milhão no mesmo dia e projeta um total de US$ 7 milhões para os cinco dias. Já \"O Brutalista\", outro candidato ao Oscar, optou por um lançamento limitado, estreando em apenas seis salas neste fim de semana.\nRecuperação nas bilheterias de fim de ano\nA temporada de fim de ano trouxe alívio para o mercado cinematográfico, reduzindo o déficit anual de 11% em novembro para 4% atualmente. O desempenho foi impulsionado por sucessos como \"Moana 2\", \"Wicked\" e \"Gladiador II\", e agora reforçado pelo bom desempenho das estreias no Natal.",
