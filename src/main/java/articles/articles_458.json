    "text": "洛馬軍團IRST莢艙F-18版發展不利 故障頻率竟達每14小時一次\n圖為F-18版的軍團IRST莢艙（機腹前）。（圖取自洛馬官網）\n羅添斌／核稿編輯\n〔記者吳哲宇／綜合報導〕國軍F-16的「紅外線搜索追蹤莢艙（IRST）」由洛馬研製，對獲匿蹤戰機具有偵獲能力，不過洛馬的軍團IRST莢艙，裝備在F-18時卻問題滿滿，美國聯邦審計署近日報告揭露，F-18的IRST莢艙在作戰測試期間存在重大可靠性問題，甚至出現過修復故障後14小時又再度故障，引發關注。\n軍聞網站「The Warzone」報導，美國聯邦審計署（GAO）指出，儘管IRST莢艙在2024年11月按計劃實現初期作戰能力，並交付第一批低速初始生產的莢艙，但全速生產的決定仍被推遲；該工程一度計劃於2025年1月全速生產，但因「飛行測試期間出現延誤」而未能實現，三年內兩次超出原訂計劃。\n且IRST負責人曾向審計署表示，由於軟體缺陷導致IRST莢艙錯誤報告過熱，操作測試被推遲兩個月。由於操作測試的延遲，指導全速生產決策的DOT&E報告發布也接連推遲2個月到2025年3月。\n審計署指出，美國國防部運輸與評估局（DOT&E）官員告訴審計署，這些莢艙「極度不可靠」，儘管改進專案透過軟體更新提高莢艙可靠性，但其平均兩次運行任務失敗間隔時間僅為14小時，低於規定的40小時。\nDOT&E報告指出，在測試期間，IRST Block II都存在硬體和軟體缺陷，導致機組人員多次重啟吊艙，故障排除和維修工作常常超出海軍維護人員的能力，需要洛馬公司的協助。\n報導指出，這些對於海軍來說並不是好消息，相關生產決策將在本月作出決定。\nF/A-18E/F的IRST莢艙型號為ASG-34A（V）1，掛載於機腹正下方，內部有熱成像感測器，能提供針對更長距離的威脅進行搜索、偵測、追蹤並且打擊之能力，且由於IRST Block II屬被動式感測系統，在不會發出訊號的情形下，大幅降低被偵知或是干擾的可能性，在電子訊號複雜、或是反雷達探測的環境中，具有高作戰效率。\n為整合新式IRST系統，美國海軍也對F/A-18戰機外掛油箱進行改良，已讓出空間掛載IRST莢艙，雖然因此減少了戰機滯空時間，但在早期預警、長程打擊能力強化之下，作戰效率仍有顯著提升。\nASG-34A（V）1內部有熱成像感測器。（圖取自洛馬官網）",

    "title": "New Orleans Saints Captains Carr, Davis Unite to Bring A Night Of Worship To The City",
    "text": "Saints Captains Carr, Davis Unite to Bring A Night Of Worship To The City It's no secret that Saints players Demario Davis and Derek Carr are men of faith. Davis has used his platform multiple times following games to educate and preach and Carr recently made a special appearance at a local New Orleans church to preach a message, something that he does quite often back in Las Vegas. Together, they're teaming up to bring A Night of Worship to the city of New Orleans at the Mahalia Jackson Theater. There will be worship led by Cece Winans and Tauren Wells. In a recent press conference, Davis expounded on why this is happening. He said, \"I think it's something that has been on my family's heart to do in the city for a while, but when you're talking about doing something like this and doing the first one of its kind, you got to make sure you do it right. It works well, mainly because of Derek (Carr) and who he is, an unbelievable person. I think everybody sees him as a player and the longevity he's had in his career and how a steady force as he's been as a player. But off the field, he's a phenomenal speaker and sharing the gospel, sharing his faith and living that out.\" Carr approached Davis to get everything going, and they didn't want to miss the opportunity. Carr will also share a word and Davis will close out the evening. Davis called the event itself 'groundbreaking' and that it will show people unity. \"I think when you're a part of sports that's so unified it brings fans together of all different types of backgrounds. It brings players in the locker of all different types of backgrounds that you can be kind of immune to racial tensions, but racial tensions is a real thing that exists in our country, whether you're operating in spaces where it doesn't affect you so much, it's always happening around us, and I think when you have an African American as myself and a Caucasian as Derek kind of coming together and people being able to see our unity and our brotherhood, but what bonds us is our faith and how it's a natural solution to issues that are happening in the world. And I think that people are trying to find the answers to those things and we just have a chance to live that out.\" It's a free event that will be held on Tuesday, June 11 from 7-9 p.m. Tickets were made available on Friday morning, and they're also [almost gone](https://www.mahaliajacksontheater.com/events/a-night-of-worship/).",

The clean-up drive is part of efforts to join the International Beach Clean-Up Day on September 21. K. Meera, Fort Kochi sub-collector, presided at the inaugural, said a press release here. The drive is organised by the Heritage Conservation Society, voluntary organisation Plan@earth and Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council.\nThe organisers said that large quantities of plastic, water hyacinth, glass and thermocol accumulated along the Fort Kochi beach would be removed during the drive. The accumulated debris had caused serious problems for tourists reaching Fort Kochi. The waste materials also affected the environment, said the communication.\nVolunteers will join the clean-up drive daily during the 30-day period. Sooraj Abraham, secretary of Planatearth, tourism joint secretary Rajeev G.L. and DTPC secretary Satheesh Meeran and Heritage Zone Conservation Society officer Boney Thomas were among those present at the inauguration of the drive, the press release added.\nPublished - September 20, 2024 01:19 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 1: The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terror group has been receiving significant support from Al Qaeda and other militant factions for executing attacks in Pakistan in addition to support from the Afghan Taliban, a media report on Thursday quoted a UN report as saying.\nDawn News reported that this information was disclosed in the 33rd report submitted to the United Nations Security Council Committee by ISIL (aka Daesh) and Al Qaeda/Taliban Monitoring Team.\nThe collaboration includes not just the provision of arms and equipment but also active on-ground support for the banned TTP’s operations against Pakistan.\nIslamabad has repeatedly expressed its frustration over the Afghan Taliban’s inaction against the outlawed TTP, which has been responsible for major terrorist attacks within Pakistan.\nAfghan Taliban’s failure to curb TTP’s activities has led to strained relations between the two countries. Pakistan views Kabul’s reluctance to tackle the TTP as a direct threat to its national security.\nThe report noted that despite the Afghan Taliban’s official stance discouraging the TTP’s activities outside Afghanistan, many TTP fighters have engaged in cross-border attacks in Pakistan without facing any substantial repercussions.\nCiting reports, it said that some Taliban members, driven by a perceived religious duty, have joined TTP’s ranks, bolstering their operations.\nMoreover, TTP members and their families are said to receive regular aid packages from the Afghan Taliban, signifying a deeper level of support.\nThe Afghan Taliban’s temporary imprisonment of between 70 and 200 TTP members and their strategy of moving personnel northward, away from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions, is perceived as an effort to alleviate Pakistani pressure to tackle the banned TTP activities.\nIn mid-2023, it recalled that the banned TTP established a new base in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where a large number of individuals were trained as suicide bombers. Additionally, Al Qaeda core and Al Qaeda in the subcontinent have been instrumental in providing training, ideological guidance, and support to the outlawed TTP, illustrating the intertwined nature of these militant networks.\nReported orders from Al Qaeda to allocate resources to the banned TTP indicated a deep-rooted collaboration aimed at destabilising the region, the report said.\nAlso, the formation of TJP (Tehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan) as a front to provide the outlawed TTP with plausible deniability, and the involvement of other groups like ETIM/TIP (East Turkestan Islamic Movement/Turkestan Islamic Party) and Majeed Brigade in joint operations with TTP, underscore the multifaceted and transnational threat posed by these militant alliances, according to the Dawn report.

    "text": "BELLEVUE, WAS / ACCESSWIRE / April 4, 2024 / Overlake Medical Center & Clinics has begun using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to take notes and summarize patient visits, allowing providers to spend less time on paperwork and more time providing care.\nOverlake Implements AI Tool to Enhance Patient-Provider Interaction, Improve Productivity\nChristy Chan, MD, Overlake Clinics primary care provider, uses AI technology to take clinical notes. Overlake has deployed Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX™) Copilot, a Microsoft product that combines conversational, ambient, and generative AI to automatically and securely draft clinical notes for immediate review and completion after each patient visit.\nDAX™ Copilot goes to work during patient-provider verbal interactions. The software drafts notes in real time that immediately translate into Epic, Overlake's electronic health record system. This process alleviates countless after-clinic hours of administrative burden-commonly referred to as \"pajama time\"-and allows providers to focus on the needs of their patients face to face.\nBeyond increasing operational efficiency, the technology improves the patient experience, as well as increases provider satisfaction and retention by reducing burnout.\n\"The psychological benefits have been the best part of this application,\" says Christy Chan, MD, Overlake Clinics family medicine physician. \"The burden of having to remember all the details and urgency of closing notes is significantly removed.\"\nAccording to a nationwide survey conducted among 1,000 clinicians who utilized DAX technology, respondents reported saving 7 minutes in notetaking per patient encounter, 79% reported experiencing a better work-life balance , and 70% said this software helped alleviate feelings of burnout and fatigue .\nDAX Copilot utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model and is amplified by the capabilities of the Microsoft Azure cloud, which is certified by the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®) and supports federal law restricting the release of medical information. This advanced software also increases accuracy by lowering the potential for human error in the charting process.\n\"Our patients' safety and privacy are our highest priorities and are factors in every decision we make about technological advancements,\" says Scott Waters, Overlake's chief information and technology officer. \"It is a sacred honor to be trusted with our patients' care, and we are pleased to offer this exciting, new tool that will elevate their experience.\"\nOverlake plans to have DAX Copilot technology implemented in at least five clinics across the organization by mid-May.\nAbout Overlake Medical Center & Clinics\nOverlake Medical Center & Clinics is a nonprofit regional healthcare system based in Bellevue, Wash., serving the Eastside community since 1960. The health system includes a 349-bed hospital and a growing network of primary, urgent and specialty care clinics located throughout the region.
