    "text": "Wintersköl returns with old traditions and new offerings If you are missing the fun and activity of the holidays there is no need to fret, Aspen’s 73rd annual Wintersköl returns on Thursday through Sunday with four days of events and celebrations. Created by the late Aspen Hall of Famer Jack dePagter in 1951, Wintersköl was born out of residents’ desire to fill the post-holiday lull with excitement and celebration while showcasing their unique Aspen lifestyle. In the past 73 years, it has evolved into an annual winter tradition. This year’s slogan is “Uniting Ski Bums and Bunnies,” and brings back popular events alongside new additions. “Winterskol is a beloved tradition that celebrates our unique Nordic lifestyle. The slogan is a nod to the ski slopes being one of the great unifiers in this town. Everyone loves a powder day,” said Julie Hardman, ACRA Senior Director of Events. “In its 73rd year, Winterskol continues to be a locally serving but destination-worthy event. This year we are excited to add the beer festival in addition to Soupsköl and we are pleased to sponsor the Buttermilk Uphill and the Drag Bingo Brunch.” Festivities unofficially kick off on Wednesday with the Apple Strudel Downhill at Aspen Highlands. The tradition originated soon after local legend and former proprietor of Gretl’s Tourtellotte Restaurant (now Bonnie’s) Gretl Uhl began making apple strudel at the Merry Go Round restaurant in 1988. To participate, follow the signs from the top of Exhibition Lift, past the Merry Go Round Restaurant to the top of Apple Strudel Run to enter the race. Run the course, then partake in strudel and hot chocolate at the finish line. No pre-registration is necessary. On Thursday, the Aspen Chamber Resort Association (ACRA) hosts the Helen K. Klanderud Wintersköl Awards and luncheon at the St. Regis. Klanderlud was elected to the Pitkin County Board of County Commissioners in 1980, making her the first woman to serve as a county commissioner. Subsequently, she served as the Mayor of Aspen from 2001-2007. Thursday also features live ice and snow sculpture carving by local Colorado artist Thomas Barlow in Wagner Park, and a preview of DanceAspen’s “Cloudline,” a creation of choreographer Robyn Mineko Williams, at the Rooftop Café on the top floor of the Aspen Art Museum. Both are free and open to the public. On Friday morning the Uphill Breakfast Club leads the way atop Buttermilk Mountain. The weekly tradition brings together uphill skiers and hikers for a hearty breakfast at The Cliffhouse. ValleyOrtho and ACRA will be offering free breakfast for all participants along with prize giveaways to celebrate Wintersköl. Other Friday events include the World Pro Ski Tour qualifications on Aspen Mountain, live music by local music collective 432One at Wagner Park, and the Aspen Valley Ski & Snowboard Club (AVSC) Rail Jam for skiers and snowboarders. This event is for all ages and will include music and prizes. Saturday kicks off with the World Pro Ski Tour Dual Super Slalom #1, Men’s Round 32, Men’s Round 16 to the finals, and Women’s Round 16 to the finals featuring Olympians, World Cup, and NCAA racers on Aspen Mountain. The afternoon brings the new Wintersköl Beer Festival at Wagner Park. The “Toast of Winter” Beer Festival will bring a selection of Colorado breweries, wineries, and distilleries for tastings, live music, food, and retail to Wagner Park and is in conjunction with the popular Soupsköl. Soupsköl was founded by local chef Reggie Barbour from Boogie’s Diner in 2004. He died in 2008, but the tradition carried on in various forms on and off until the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 the beloved event returned to downtown Aspen. The tradition sees restaurants from across the Roaring Fork Valley come together to compete for the best soup and the first place “copper kettle.” Locals and visitors enjoy two hours of free soup tastings and then vote for their favorites. Last year, The Gant’s Pepperjack’s Cafe took the prize with a creamy tomato soup and mini grilled cheese, while Hominy in El Jebel earned second place with a Bayou Gumbo and Big Hoss Grill of Snowmass came in third with a clam chowder. The day ends with a family-friendly bonfire in Wagner Park and the Torchlight Parade and fireworks display on Aspen Mountain. The event will have a first come, first serve sign-up at the base of Nell Chair starting at 6:30 p.m. with the lift uploading from 7:30-7:45 p.m. Adults will be given flares to carry for the ski down, and kids have glowstick options. The parade, led by an Aspen Snowmass Ski Pro, will begin at 8 p.m. The fireworks display will immediately follow once skiers are off the hill. Event organizers suggest that participants wear clothing that they don’t mind getting burn marks from flares. Sunday Wintersköl overlaps with the kick-off of Aspen Gay Ski Week at Drag Bingo Brunch in the Grand Salon of The Little Nell. The Aspen Gay Ski Week (AGSW) and Wintersköl crossover brunch with Drag Queen Bingo, hosted by Ms. Mariam T. Brunch, will include morning eats and options of prosecco, mimosas, and Bloody Marys. This is a ticketed fundraising event presented by AGSW, The Little Nell, and ACRA to benefit the non-profit AspenOUT. [Aspen Gay Ski Week](https://gayskiweek.com/event/bingo-brunch-at-the-little-nell/). Sunday includes the World Pro Ski Tour Dual Super Slalom #2, Men’s Round 32, Men’s Round 16 to the finals, Women’s Round 16 to the finals, and a partnership free screening with Aspen Film of the animated film “Abominable” at the ISIS Theatre.

    "title": "US State Dept. slams Smotrich’s transfer of $134 million from PA’s frozen funds to terror victims",
    "text": "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich attends a Finance committee meeting at the Knesset, on June 10, 2024 NEW YORK – In a Thursday afternoon post on X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that he signed an order transferring about $134 million from the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) frozen funds to victims of terrorism. Smotrich described the order, which he signed on Sunday, as an act of “historical justice,” saying that the PA “encourages and favors terrorism by paying the families of terrorists, prisoners, and released prisoners.” “By the judgments that awarded compensation to the victims of terrorism, we offset the same amounts from the PA’s funds and transfer the awarded money to the families of the victims of terrorism,” Smotrich added. On Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller described Smotrich’s order as “not appropriate” and “an extraordinarily wrongheaded decision by the minister.” US State Department criticizes move by Smotrich “We have made quite clear to the government of Israel that these funds belong to the Palestinian people. They should be transferred to the Palestinian Authority immediately,” Miller stressed. “They should not have been held. They should not be delayed.

Blinken ordered the State Department to start examining the possibility of US and international recognition of a state of Palestine the day after the Gaza war ends.

Blinken ordered the State Department to start examining the possibility of US and international recognition of a state of Palestine the day after the Gaza war ends. (credit: REUTERS) “The money belongs to the Palestinian people, and it’s important that [they] have the ability to fund their government to pursue activities as they deem fit,” Miller further stated. “But also, the case that we have made to Israel is that this kind of decision is extraordinarily self-defeating,” Miller added. “It doesn’t just hurt the Palestinian people; it hurts Israel as well.” According to Miller, the PA has worked incredibly hard to maintain calm and stability in the West Bank over the years, especially since October 7. “And this kind of action by the Israeli government risks destabilizing the West Bank and further harming Israel’s security,” he said. The Jerusalem Post reached out to a spokesperson for Smotrich for comment.",

    "text": "“Ela era a protetora silenciosa das nossas florestas”: Vatsala, considerada a elefanta mais velha da Ásia, morre com mais de 100 anos Por Filipe Pimentel Rações 6:02 - 17 Julho 2025 Vatsala, considerada a elefanta mais velha da Ásia, morreu no passado dia 8 de julho, na Índia, com mais de 100 anos. Foto: Panna National Park.\nPartilhar No passado dia 8 de julho, Vatsala, considerada a elefanta-asiática ( Elephas maximus ) mais velha do mundo, morreu com mais de 100 anos no Parque Nacional de Panna, no estado indiano de Madhya Pradesh.\nDe acordo com as informações divulgadas por esse parque, Vatsala, também conhecida como “Dadi Maa” e “Dai Maa”, alcunhas que refletem o papel do grande mamífero como matriarca e cuidadora, nasceu por volta de 1917 nas florestas de Nilambur, em Kerala, na Índia.\nComeçou a sua vida como um animal de carga, usada para transportar madeira cortada. Por volta de 1970, quando o país adotou legislação para proteger os elefantes, Vatsala foi resgatada da vida de trabalho e levada para a cidade de Hoshangabad, em Madhya Pradesh. Em 1993, foi finalmente transferida para o Parque Nacional de Panna, onde passou o resto da sua longa vida.\nVatsala servia como mãe adotiva de jovens elefantes órfãos e era a matriarca da sua manada. Foto: Panna National Park. Enquanto no parque, Vatsala ajudou as equipas a detetarem tigres para integrar no seu programa de conservação do felídeo selvagem. Depois de 2003, altura em que se “reformou” dessa função, atuou como mãe adotiva de jovens elefantes órfãos resgatados que chegavam ao parque e líder da sua manada.\nO parque recorda-a como tendo “uma natura gentil e uma presença icónica” e como sendo uma grande atração para os visitantes.\nNos últimos dias da sua vida, Vatsala lutava contra vários problemas de saúde, como a perda de visão. Apesar dos esforços do pessoal veterinário, que ajudaram a que alcançasse uma idade tão avançada para a sua espécie (estima-se que os elefantes-asiáticos vivam, em média, 70 anos na Natureza e mais de 80 em cativeiro), a matriarca acabou por falecer devido à falência de múltiplos órgãos, atribuída à sua idade.\nMohan Yadav, líder do governo do estado de Madhya Pradesh, escreveu na rede social X (antigo Twitter) que Vatsala “não era apenas uma elefanta, ela era a protetora silenciosa das nossas florestas, uma amiga de gerações e um símbolo das emoções de Madhya Pradesh”.\n‘वत्सला’ का सौ वर्षों का साथ आज विराम पर पहुंचा। पन्ना टाइगर रिज़र्व में आज दोपहर ‘वत्सला’ ने अंतिम सांस ली।\nवह मात्र हथिनी नहीं थी, हमारे जंगलों की मूक संरक्षक, पीढ़ियों की सखी और मप्र की संवेदनाओं की प्रतीक थीं।\nटाइगर रिज़र्व की यह प्रिय सदस्य अपनी आंखों में अनुभवों का सागर… pic.twitter.com/u8a6ZBAKEj\n— Dr Mohan Yadav (@DrMohanYadav51) July 8, 2025\n“Ela já não está entre nós, mas a sua memória continuará para sempre viva no nosso solo e na nossa mente”, salienta o responsável.\nEm nota, o Parque Nacional de Panna refere, em jeito de homenagem, que “a vida de Vatsala serve como um poderoso lembrete da importância da proteção dos elefantes e da profunda ligação entre os humanos e os animais selvagens”.\nE assegura que “o seu legado continuará a inspirar entusiastas da vida selvagem e a impulsionar futuras iniciativas de conservação na Índia”.\nOs elefantes-asiáticos são considerados uma espécie “Em Perigo” de extinção, de acordo com a Lista Vermelha de Espécies Ameaçadas da União Internacional para a Conservação da Natureza. As suas populações, outrora presentes por toda a Ásia e agora confinadas a pequenos núcleos fragmentados no sudeste asiático, continuam em declínio, especialmente devido à degradação e perda de habitat, à caça-furtiva, ao tráfico do seu marfim e aos conflitos com humanos.\nEmbora não se saiba ao certo quantos elefantes-asiático restam no mundo, estimativas apontam para menos de 50 mil indivíduos.\nO corpo de Vatsala foi cremado no Parque Nacional de Panna, durante cerimónias fúnebres para honrar o legado deixado pela matriarca.\nPartilhar",

What is your intention? I can also go back to 1962 as well,\" he said.</p>.<p>The ties between the two countries nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades.</p>.<p>India has been maintaining that its ties with China cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border areas.</p>.<p>The two sides held the last round of high-level military talks in February with an aim to resolve the row.</p>.<p>Though there was no indication of a breakthrough at the 21st round of talks, both sides agreed to maintain 'peace and tranquillity' on the ground and continue the communication on the way ahead.</p>.China moved military forces in disregard of agreements: Jaishankar on eastern Ladakh border row.<p>The next round of military talks is expected to be held soon.</p>.<p>In January, Army Chief Gen Manoj Pande said the situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh is 'stable' but 'sensitive' and asserted that the Indian troops are maintaining a 'very high state' of operational preparedness to effectively deal with any eventualities.</p>.<p>Gen Pande also said that both India and China continue to hold talks at military and diplomatic levels with an aim to return to the 'status quo ante' that existed in the middle of 2020.</p>.<p>The eastern Ladakh border standoff erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area.</p>.<p>As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in several friction points, including on the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.</p>.<div><p><strong>Deccan Herald is on WhatsApp Channels</strong>| <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/specials/deccan-herald-is-now-on-whatsapp-heres-how-you-can-join-2698271\">Join now for Breaking News & Editor's Picks</a></p></div>",

Ahora estamos en actividad máxima. Aparte de eso las auroras son provocadas por una eyección de masa coronal, pero estas eyecciones (llamadas CME) han de ir dirigidas a la tierra para que aparezcan las auroras, y muchas veces no vienen en nuestra dirección o nos dan de refilón.... y hay otros datos como la polaridad de la CME que tambien influye. En resumen: aparecen por una combinación de actividad solar y suerte que haga que vengan en nuestra dirección. Las dos de este año visibles desde españa no son algo excepcional, aunque si poco frecuente.\n[#19](c19#c-19) Es excepcional que se vean, porque cada once años hay unas pocas y tiene que coincidir que no haya nubes.\nLas de ayer, en Galicia:\n[#45](c45#c-45) Seguro que hay muchos más. P. ej. https://www.gciencia.com/medioambiental/o-ceo-galego-tinguese-de-rosa-asi-foi-a-nova-e-espectacular-aurora-boreal/\n[#40](c40#c-40) ayer a la 1:30 de la mañana iba por la A6 a la altura de Becerreá y se vieron increíbles.\n[#12](c12#c-12) y yo que pensaba que \"sin precendentes\" era sinónimo de excepcional...\n[#12](c12#c-12) desde mi humilde ignorancia, yo no recuerdo que en otros máximos solares haya habido auroras boreales tan al Sur.... hay registros de la última vez que ocurrió en España...?\n[#1](c1#c-1) o a Perro Sanxe, a Irene Montero, a rayos laser judios del espacio…\n[#1](c1#c-1) tranquilo ya lo achacan a la geoingieneria\n[#1](c1#c-1) ¿A qué se puede deber?. Realmente me choca que haya auroras boreales en estas latitudes, pero desconozco si es un hecho que ya se ha registrado en el pasado (en el pasado reciente, con registros rigurosos, no en escritos medievales y tal...). Si las auroras son provocadas por el sol, como tengo entendido, ¿qué ha cambiado en ciclo solar que las pueda estar provocando?.\nCuriosidad desde el desconocimiento.\n[#6](c6#c-6) No tiene porque ser solo el sol, el campo magnético de la tierra también cambia y fluctúa.\n[#1](c1#c-1) He visto suficientes películas de desastres como para saber que despues se viene el apocalipsis.\n[#1](c1#c-1) a mi lo que me escama es que el Friker Jiménez que ha dedicado en el pasado programas al \"peligro\" de las tormentas solares haya pasado de puntillas sobre este tema de las auroras boreales tan tan al Sur (cuando ocurrieron por primera vez hace unas semanas y supongo que ahora igual), cuando debería dedicarle un programa entero con ejjjjpertos y teorías a cascoporro... lo que me lleva a pensar que si ni siquiera los \"magufos oficiales\" le prestan atención, es que algo \"gordo\" viene y está aún más tapado que de costumbre....\n[#1](c1#c-1) Aquí lo tienes\n.\n[#7](c7#c-7) [#9](c9#c-9) [#24](c24#c-24) [#26](c26#c-26) \"Si es bien cierto que las auroras boreales en España en realidad no son improbables, lo que sí es una circunstancia que parece única es que en un mismo año hayamos disfrutado de dos espectáculos similares. \"\nParece que a lo que se refiere es que no hay precedentes de que hayan ocurrido dos veces en un mismo año... pero vete tú a saber...\n[#35](c35#c-35) Perdón, no entré a ver los tuits de la noticia. Hablaba por tuits que vi por la mañana al despertar. Con fotos y comentarios que hablaban de las 04:00... Pero bueno, era broma. Si sé a ciencia cierta que va a haber semejante espectáculo estoy despierto yo y hasta despierto a mi hija de cinco años para que lo vea.\n[#39](c39#c-39) Los cometas si no se ven muy bien a simple vista no me llaman tanto la atención. Recuerdo de joven, allá por el ¿96?, el Hale-Bopp que se veía a enorme a simple vista. Aquello si que era un espectáculo...\nY hará 10 años hice mis pinitos de astrofotografía con un telescopio Dobson y la reflex... cómo mola fotografiar tus propias galaxias\nIgual el problema es que ya no tengo telescopio y los últimos cometas los he visto con prismáticos. Sacar fotos del cometa con un telescopio+reflex igual si que era interesante... pero esa afición ya pasó. Ya no hay tiempo para ir de noche a pasar frío jejeje\n[#17](c17#c-17) mmm... no.\n[#17](c17#c-17) No.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Antes comamos unos gambones al vapor.\n[#9](c9#c-9) a esto venía\nEn España lo tenemos todo para el turista. A partir del 2024 incluimos auroras boreales en el catálogo.\nEsto el Ministerio de Igualdad lo iguala rápido.",

    "text": "Officials in India discovered 72 parrots in poor conditions in the home of a smuggler who captured them for illegal bird trading. The forest department in Kanpur, India, conducted a raid on a notorious wildlife smuggler and rescued dozens of exotic birds from his house, according to a report by the Times of India. Among them were Alexandrine parakeets and rose-ringed parakeets, which are both protected species, making it illegal to have and trade them. The birds were kept in cramped cages and clearly in distress. Thankfully, the department transferred them all to a wildlife rehabilitation center where they will hopefully regain their health. Any type of animal smuggling or trafficking is terrible for wildlife and the environment. The most smuggled animals are usually the rarest and most protected species, which can hurt their chances of survival. Bringing them outside of their native habitats can also make them an invasive species . This can destroy ecological balance and is a major threat to the natural environment, further setting us back from a cleaner and safer future for all. Invasive species can be predators to native species and compete for resources with them. This can lead to native population declines and a deterioration of the ecosystem. They can also spread pests and diseases that harm humans, animals, and farm crops. Unfortunately, the area where the birds were kept is a known hotspot for illegal bird trade. Officials have recently taken more action to crack down on these smugglers, the Times of India said. In addition to more patrolling, they are also running programs to encourage citizens to be aware of the problem and report any known or suspected wildlife trafficking. Donating money to relevant causes can also help prevent animal trafficking. Do you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?
