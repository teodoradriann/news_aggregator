    "title": "How Heat Pumps Could Save Most Americans on Energy Bills",
    "text": "New research shows the mass adoption of air-source heat pumps could save most Americans money on their energy bills while slashing carbon emissions. welcomia/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nMost Americans would save money by switching their heating and cooling systems to a heat pump, according to new research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\nIt’s the latest report demonstrating the energy-saving value of heat pumps, the all-electric, highly efficient appliances that can replace both fossil-fuel burning furnaces and less-efficient air conditioners.\nThe NREL study, published in the journal Joule, focused on air-source heat pumps, which are less expensive but also less efficient than their geothermal cousins. Air-source heat pumps cycle a refrigerant between your in-home unit and the air outside, capturing thermal energy from outside (even when it’s cold) and using it to heat your home in the winter and doing the opposite in the summer to cool your home off. Geothermal heat pumps do the same, but run the refrigerant underground to tap into the warmth below the surface.\nHeating is the biggest use of home energy, and carbon emissions from energy production are a principal driver of climate change. Nationally, heat pumps would reduce home energy use by 31% to 47% on average and residential greenhouse gas emissions by 36% to 64%, the study found.\n“There are millions of people who would benefit from putting in heat pumps, and there are incentives made available through the Inflation Reduction Act, both tax credits and rebates, that millions of households can benefit from,” Eric Wilson, the study’s lead author and a senior research engineer in the Buildings Technologies and Science Center at NREL, said in a statement. “But what this paper shows is that there are still millions more households for whom the technology is still pretty expensive, and we need work to bring down the cost of installing heat pumps.”\nHow heat pumps reduce home energy costs Air-source heat pumps are seen as a vital component of the global shift away from fossil fuels, which cause climate change, because they can replace other heating appliances, like furnaces, that tend to run on fuels like natural gas, which is mostly the fossil fuel methane.\nThe NREL research used simulations of 550,000 statistically representative households, looking at factors like the performance of different heat pump types and whether other energy efficiency steps like insulation upgrades were done. Depending on the efficiency of the heat pumps, 62 to 95% of households would see their energy bills drop, with that range improving to 85 to 97% if other energy efficiency upgrades are done.\nOne hurdle? The high cost of installing a heat pump. The study noted that some installers might charge more to put in a heat pump because they’re unfamiliar with the equipment and how to size it properly.\nHomes that are heated by propane, fuel oil or with an existing electric furnace would see savings at a higher rate than those that have a gas furnace, the authors found.\nThe technology of heat pumps The report noted that the biggest savings were found in colder climates where heating demands are higher.\nThe problem with heat pumps in the cold is that they can run into problems at extremely low temperatures — besides there being less heat in the outside air to bring indoors, ice can form around the outdoor coils, further reducing efficiency. Heat pumps can defrost on their own, but that requires energy, making them less efficient overall.\nManufacturers are developing and improving the technology for heat pumps that can operate at lower temps. The increased availability of highly efficient, electric heating technology that works at lower temperatures could make a heat pump viable as the sole heating and cooling appliance for more homes in the northern United States. Right now, many homeowners in colder climates who have heat pumps also maintain a fuel-burning furnace as a backup when the temperature drops.",

    "title": "Alienware m16 R2 Review: A Multi-Purpose Sleeper Gaming Laptop | HotHardware",
    "text": "Alienware's m16 R2 Brings Balance And Poise With The Latest Gaming Laptop Platform Tech\nAlienware m16 R2 Gaming Laptop: Starts at $1,499, as tested $1,849\nDell has reimagined its new mid-sized Alienware m16 R2 gaming laptop, and the result is a more efficient yet still potent, Intel Meteor Lake-powered beauty.\nClean Understated Design Solid, Balanced Performance Quality Keyboard Competitive Pricing Strong Battery Life No Webcam Privacy Cover Cooling Solution Can Get Loud Under Load\nAt CES 2024, we previewed Alienware’s redesigned m16 R2 laptop , and considered it impressive alien tech with improved cooling, a more optimized footprint, with strong projected performance in a more refined, almost subdued package, at least for an Alienware machine. However, the Alienware team also took a more balanced approach to this new 16-inch gaming laptop, powering our test system with an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor and a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU. The Alienware m16 R2 is a slight departure from Alienware’s past, perhaps, wherein the gaming products division of Dell appears to be targeting a professional-by-day and gamer-by-night audience with this machine, and from that perspective its specs and design certainly fit the bill.\nWith that in mind, let's dive deeper into Alienware's new 16-inch gaming machine and see how the sum of its parts comes together for gaming, content creation and productivity... Alienware m16 R2 Specifications\nFind The Alienware M16 R2 @ Dell.Com\nDell sent us an Alienware m16 R2 configuration with a 16-core Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, which features six P-Cores that top out at 4.8 GHz, eight E-Cores at 3.8 GHz, and two low-power island E-Cores at 2.5GHz. If you want to configure this machine to the max, however, you can opt for an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, which has six higher clocked P-Cores at 5.1 GHz. Regardless, these processor options are based on Intel's Meteor Lake family featuring a tiled architecture, including a neural processing unit (NPU), which we took a look at late last year when Meteor Lake first debuted. Our configuration also came with 16GB (2x8GB) DDR5 RAM at 5600 MT/s, but that can be increased up to 64 GB in a 2x32GB setup if you so chose.\nFor graphics horsepower, our laptop has the top end GPU available for the m16 R2, which is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 with a max TGP of 140W, a base clock of 2,070 MHz and a boost clock of 2,175 MHz. If you want to save a few bucks, GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4050 options are also available. Regarding storage, our test system came with a 1TB m.2 NVMe SSD, but option are available for up to an absolutely wild 8TB RAID0 setup with two 4TB m.2 PCIE NVMe SSDs on board. All this cutting-edge hardware is powered by a 90Whr, 6-cell lithium-ion battery, which is fairly stout for a machine this size, though when gaming you'll likely want to be near a power outlet. Toned Down - Alienware m16 R2 Design & Build Quality\nInspecting the industrial design of the m16 R2, everything is enclosed in an anodized aluminum chassis coated with Alienware’s Dark Metallic Moon finish. This is nicely accented by the embossed “16” on the lid as well as the RGB alien head logo in the middle, which is typical of Alienware’s design signature. All around, this laptop feels nice and seems robustly built, with minimal flex. Of note is the loss of the rear shelf, or what some might remember as a big bump-out off the back of older generation Alienware laptops. Removing this feature not only changes the laptop's form factor and appearance, with the loss of some RGB accents, but also Alienware's on-board cooling system\nDespite keeping ports on the back, the Alienware m16 R2 was redesigned to have a 15% smaller footprint than the previous generation, thanks to the loss of that shelf. As such, the Alienware team had to devise a cooling setup with more efficient airflow, 43% more than the m16 R1 to be exact, to keep things running smoothly. This is aided by the hexagonal vents which can be found on the bottom of the chassis as well as on the sides, back, and above the keyboard of this machine. With this change, though, came the introduction of two fans, which have 94 “ultra-thin” blades that exhaust air out the right, left, and rear vents. While the solution is very effective, these fans can spin up fairly high and make some noise, which we will touch on later.\nUpon lifting the lid, you’ll find this machine sports a 16-inch QHD+ (2560x1600) high refresh rate display made for gaming, especially competitive shooter style games. It features 100% sRGB coverage, 3ms response time, and a 240Hz, refresh rate alongside NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync. On the downside, the panel's max brightness is only 300-nits, but the display performed just fine in our indoor testing. Besides the specifications of the screen, opening this laptop up is satisfying, with a strong hinge mechanism. That hinge also supports 180-degrees of swing as well for optimal viewing angles.\nYou're also greeted up top with the Alienware FHD 1080p integrated webcam with dual-array microphones and Windows Hello IR support. We are a little disappointed that this does not have an integrated privacy shutter as many other laptops do, but that can be added on after the fact with ease, so it is not the end of the world. Below the display, you are met with the Alienware M Series AlienFX keyboard that has 1.8mm key travel and N-key rollover, all of which combine to make for a solid typing experience. Below that is the multi-touch gesture touchpad with integrated scrolling and 1-zone AlienFX RGB border, which pairs nicely with the per-key AlienFX RGB keyboard our configuration had. The onboard dual speaker system does its job fairly well, but it's not the pinnacle of fidelity. The system can definitely push high volume, but just temper your expectations for the usual laptop quality sound, and pop on a set of Alienware headphones for better immersion.\nAlong the sides of this m16 R2, you'll find a plethora of ports for basically everything you could ever need. On the left, you'll find an all too rare slim RJ-45 port next to an almost equally rare headphone jack. The RJ-45 ethernet port supports up to 2.5Gbps as well, offering a nice boost if your home network supports it. Speaking of connectivity, Alienware also employed Intel's BE202 combo Bluetooth 5.4 and WiFi-7 module, enabling gamers to be ready for next generation wireless speeds and better range via its 6GHz band and a 2x2 antenna configuration.\nOn the right are two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one of which has PowerShare technology indicated by a little battery icon above the USB icon. You will also find a handy microSD card slot for external flash storage access for cameras and the like.\nAround the back is where the real magic is, however, as Alienware has kept the most important ports back there. From left to right, we first have a USB-C port boasting Thunderbolt 4, USB 4 Gen 2, 15W power delivery and DisplayPort 1.4 to the iGPU. The second USB-C port is USB 3.2 Gen 2 with DisplayPort 1.4 to the dGPU. Then, there is an HDMI 2.1 port that also goes to the dGPU which is flanked by the barrel-connector style power port.\nNow, with this new alien space craft spread out in all its glory, it’s time to see what Alienware has cooking when you boot this puppy up. Alienware m16 R2 Software Experience\nThe m16 R2 can come with either Windows 11 Home or Pro . At the end of the day, the m16 R2 offers a fairly standard out-of-box experience with a few minor additions, the first of which is the “My Alienware” app, which gives users some information about the device, such as specs and warranty information. Further, you can use this app to get details and manuals for your device, interact with the Alienware community, find accessories, and get support if needed.\nThe other piece of software loaded by default is the Alienware Command Center, which allows you to control system performance, power and thermals, and AlienFX RGB lighting, all of which can be customized to your game library if you like as well. Overall, it is easy to navigate, and just by clicking the relevant icons (pictured above), you will be taken to the corresponding menu.\nWith respect to performance, you can easily switch between modes in the System Performance menu and see how your alien battleship is doing in terms of utilization or thermals. However, the laptop does this automatically when you launch into a game, when you will notice a switch over to the display being connected to the discrete GPU, along with a notification about a switch into high-performance mode. A little performance notification will also sit on the screen, which you can hover over and quickly see how your system is doing while in an intensive task like a game. Again you can tweak all this and how your RGB lighting looks per-game through the Alienware Command Center.\nAnd with all of our Alienware exploration out of the way, let’s run some benchmarks and see how the m16 R2 fares where the rubber meets the road…",

La doctora Miriam Teresita Llanes, jefa del Centro de Pronósticos del Instituto de Meteorología (Insmet), precisó a Granma que el anunciado deterioro de las condiciones del tiempo obedece al avance, sobre el archipiélago cubano, de una activa onda tropical, en cuyo seno debe formarse un centro de bajas presiones cerca o sobre el territorio nacional. Resaltó la especialista que en las áreas de precipitaciones y de tormentas eléctricas pueden registrarse rachas de vientos fuertes e incluso tormentas eléctricas severas. Debe prestarse mucha atención a las inundaciones que podrían generarse en zonas bajas y de mal drenaje, subrayó. Según indicó, las imágenes satelitales mostraban que la onda tropical cubría la República Dominicana, Haití y la porción norte del mar Caribe oriental. Dada su trayectoria y las condiciones oceánicas y atmosféricas favorables al desarrollo ciclónico tropical, el Centro de Pronósticos del Insmet mantendrá una estrecha vigilancia sobre la evolución del sistema.",

    "text": "Doctors don’t do better at diagnosing health problems with AI assistance Diagnoses were about as accurate as they would be without AI AI outperformed doctors when it diagnosed on its own, but it would fare less well in real-life scenarios, researchers said FRIDAY, Nov. 15, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- AI can’t yet help doctors improve their ability to diagnose complex conditions, a sobering new study has found. Doctors had about the same diagnostic accuracy whether or not they were using ChatGPT Plus, according to results published recently in the journal [JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825395). However, the AI outperformed doctors when allowed to diagnose on its own, the researchers noted. “Our study shows that AI alone can be an effective and powerful tool for diagnosis,” said researcher [Dr. Andrew Parsons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-parsons-md-mph-b527b551/), who oversees the teaching of clinical skills to medical students at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “We were surprised to find that adding a human physician to the mix actually reduced diagnostic accuracy though improved efficiency,” Parsons said. “These results likely mean that we need formal training in how best to use AI.” For the study, researchers provided 50 doctors with case studies based on real-life patients. These cases included details about medical history, physical exams and lab test results. The doctors were randomly assigned to two groups -- one that diagnosed the patients’ conditions based solely on the info available and standard reference materials, and another that used ChatGPT Plus to help inform their diagnosis. Doctors using ChatGPT returned an accurate diagnosis about 76% of the time, compared with about 74% for those not aided by AI, results show. The ChatGPT group did come to their diagnoses slightly faster -- about 8.6 minutes compared to 9.4 minutes for those without AI help, researchers found. When ChatGPT Plus was given the case studies on its own, it achieved an accuracy of more than 92%. However, researchers caution that the AI would likely fare less well in real life, when diagnosing patients on the fly versus evaluating case studies. More study is needed to assess the ability of AI to diagnose medical problems, particularly in terms of the downstream effects of diagnoses and the treatment decisions that result from them, researchers said. “As AI becomes more embedded in healthcare, it's essential to understand how we can leverage these tools to improve patient care and the physician experience,” Parsons said. “This study suggests there is much work to be done in terms of optimizing our partnership with AI in the clinical environment.” More information The Cleveland Clinic has more about [AI in health care](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/ai-in-healthcare).

    "text": "Se reúne con el Magisterio nacional La educación pública es la mejor gracias a los maestros y maestras de México: Claudia Sheinbaum Claudia Sheinbaum destaca la excelencia de la educación pública en México durante un encuentro con maestros, resaltando logros de la Cuarta Transformación y el compromiso con la equidad educativa En México la educación pública es la mejor de las educaciones gracias a la gran labor de los maestros y maestras del Magisterio, así lo destacó Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, precandidata única a la Presidencia de México por Morena, el Partido del Trabajo (PT) y el Partido Verde Ecologista de México (PVEM) durante un encuentro nacional con profesores y profesoras en el que aseguró que la Cuarta Transformación defiende como ningún otro modelo a la educación pública, contrario a lo que sucedía en el periodo neoliberal. “Minimizaron al Magisterio Nacional, se acabó ese periodo del neoliberalismo en donde todo lo público parecía que lo querían desaparecer, valoraron la educación particular como si fuera mejor que la educación pública, es falso, la educación pública es la mejor de todas las educaciones en nuestro país gracias a los maestros y maestras de México”, aseveró. Por lo anterior, destacó que con la 4T quedó demostrado que los estudiantes, los profesores y profesoras de México son una prioridad, esto con programas como la beca para jóvenes que estudian en preparatoria y particularmente con la basificación de más de un millón de maestros y maestras. “El Presidente de la República recuperó algo fundamental que es el reconocimiento a los maestros de nuestro país, ese reconocimiento que fue echar para atrás la reforma educativa y recuperar el valor del Magisterio Nacional en toda su magnitud”, añadió. Por lo anterior, hizo hincapié en que junto a los maestros y maestras de México es vital trabajar en unidad no sólo para atender las necesidades que aún quedan pendientes en el sector educativo, sino que también para garantizar la continuidad de la Cuarta Transformación cuya meta siempre será apoyar a la educación pública. “El mejor legado que le podemos dejar a nuestros hijos y nuestras hijas es decir: Formamos parte del segundo piso de la Cuarta Transformación de la vida Pública de México”, concluyó. En el encuentro nacional con maestros y maestras, la coordinadora política nacional del Magisterio, Sonia Rincón Chanona, reconoció en Claudia Sheinbaum a una mujer honesta que va a garantizar que la educación sea parte clave para continuar con la tarea humanista que significa la Cuarta Transformación, la cual busca cerrar la brecha que ha excluido durante muchos años a miles de mexicanos y mexicanas, tal y como lo hizo en la Ciudad de México como Jefa de Gobierno, donde todos los niños y niñas desde preescolar hasta secundaria tienen un apoyo mensual para continuar estudiando con el programa “Bienestar Para Niñas y Niños. Mi Beca Para Empezar”. “Las maestras y los maestros tenemos importantes coincidencias con el proyecto social y humanista de esta Cuarta Transformación para que construyamos juntos un país más justo, equitativo e igualitario (...) Para alcanzar el México que anhelamos Claudia Sheinbaum es la indicada (...) Claudia Sheinbaum es una mujer honesta, no es una corrupta, sabemos que con ella vamos a tener buena respuesta”, aseveró. En el evento, el coordinador político del Valle de Toluca, Eliud Terrazas Ceballos, reiteró el apoyo de los maestros y maestras de México a Claudia Sheinbaum, pues destacó que juntos son aliados para garantizar que los jóvenes y niños puedan acceder al derecho de la educación. “Cuenta con nosotros en este camino y cuenta con nosotros para ocupar la primera magistratura de nuestro país, los maestros y maestras están con usted (...) Somos un aliado confiable del estado y de la sociedad mexicana, porque nos unen los propósitos de garantizar a los niños y jóvenes mexicanos el ejercicio pleno de su derecho humano a la educación”, destacó. Por su parte, el coordinador político del Valle de México, Rigoberto Vargas Cervantes, reiteró que Claudia Sheinbaum siempre ha sido una gran aliada de los maestros y maestras de México. “Nuestra querida doctora sabe de todo lo que hacen las maestras y los maestros para hacer gestión y que sus escuelas estén en buenas condiciones por eso nos ha platicado y comentado que estará siempre pendiente y que la educación y la escuela pública será una de sus grandes prioridades”, puntualizó. Al encuentro nacional en el que asistieron miles de maestros y maestras de todo México, también estuvieron presentes, el presidente nacional de Morena, Mario Delgado Carillo; la dirigente estatal de Morena, Martha Guerrero Sanchez, el coordinador de Enlace con Organizaciones Sociales, Gerardo Fernández Noroña; los precandidatos a Senadores de la República, Mariela Gutiérrez Escalante y Higinio Martínez Miranda; así como Alfonso Ramírez Cuéllar y Raúl Morón Orozco, coordinador de la Dra. Claudia Sheinbaum en el Estado de México.

    "title": "Arsenal didn't look like title contenders in West Ham loss - ESPN",
    "text": "LONDON -- The debate over whether [Arsenal](/football/team?id=359) can handle a [Premier League](/football/league/_/name/ENG.1) title run-in just grew louder. After falling short last season despite holding an eight-point lead at the beginning of April, the principal challenge this time around for manager Mikel Arteta was evolving the Gunners into a more robust proposition to last the pace. There had been clear signs of progress in that regard this season, but the manner of [Thursday's 2-0 defeat](/football/match/_/gameId/671218) to [West Ham](/football/team/_/id/371/west-ham-united) will spark familiar questions about whether Arsenal can triumph in what is threatening to be a multiway fight to be champions. - Stream on ESPN+: [LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)](/espnplus/schedule/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS) - Read on ESPN+: [Ranking the faves in all of Europe's competitions](/football/insider/story/_/id/39145448/ranking-champions-league-europa-league-conference-league-favorites) A row will continue over the opening goal given the ball may have drifted out of play as [Jarrod Bowen](/soccer/player/_/id/201089/jarrod-bowen) pulled it back for [Tomás Soucek](/soccer/player/_/id/230666/tomas-soucek) to score after 13 minutes. VAR official Craig Pawson took a long look but no camera angle could conclusively overturn the on-field decision and a goal was awarded. Regardless, Arsenal lacked the composure associated with serial title-winners. Their defending -- which led to [Gabriel Magalhaes](/soccer/player/_/id/236322/gabriel) hitting the ball against [Oleksandr Zinchenko](/soccer/player/_/id/217482/oleksandr-zinchenko) to give Bowen a chance to pounce -- was calamitous on the first goal. Their response in possession was even more troubling. Wasting chances at one end and conceding another soft goal at the other was a recipe for disaster. The pre-match talk of a summer signing coming back to haunt his former club came to pass but not in the manner anyone expected. This ended up being a night to forget for [Declan Rice](/soccer/player/_/id/238262/declan-rice) as ex-Arsenal defender [Konstantinos Mavropanos](/soccer/player/_/id/242705/konstantinos-mavropanos) scored his first Premier League goal with an excellent 55th-minute header. After excelling for his new club time and again this season, Rice endured the taunts of West Ham fans for the final 20 minutes or so here as a result of his £105 million summer move to Emirates Stadium. Rice's form has been a big factor in Arsenal's apparent evolution but, in a moment that perfectly encapsulated their regression here, he gave away a penalty in stoppage time, bringing arguably the biggest cheer of the night from the away end. Few seemed to care that [David Raya](/soccer/player/_/id/196176/david-raya) saved substitute [Saïd Benrahma](/soccer/player/_/id/194543/said-benrahma)'s spot kick as the final whistle came seconds later. Arteta has rightly praised the home atmosphere in recent times, given the transformation from the toxic disconnect that provided the soundtrack to the end of Arsene Wenger's time in charge -- but there was a tension in the air against the Hammers that did not dissipate all evening. There wasn't the maturity in Arsenal's play that we have come to expect, perhaps most obviously evidenced by their play in the final third. [Gabriel Jesus](/soccer/player/_/id/217289/gabriel-jesus) headed the ball over on 66 minutes and Martin Odegaard forced [Alphonse Areola](/soccer/player/_/id/148987/alphonse-areola) into a fine save at the end, but there was little else of note despite registering 77 touches in West Ham's box -- the most on record since 2008-09 in a single Premier League match for a team who failed to score. [Bukayo Saka](/soccer/player/_/id/280555/bukayo-saka) (who hit the post in the first half), [Emile Smith Rowe](/soccer/player/_/id/266697/emile-smith-rowe) and [Eddie Nketiah](/soccer/player/_/id/259486/eddie-nketiah) all registered shots on target in the final 12 minutes but none of them required anything other than a simple stop by Areola. Arteta, however, believed they created enough to win the game. \"When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing,\" Arteta said. \"But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30, I don't know how many touches in the box, how many situations, how many opportunities to score and we haven't done it. In football you have to do that better if you want to win. \"It's what it is. We have to try to generate. If we don't score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That's the only thing. I can't imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn't enough to win the game.\" Their failure in front of goal will also only strengthen the argument a new striker is needed in January. \"All we have is the players we have, the players I love the most,\" said Arteta. \"What we have to do is try to get better situations, more training, raise the confidence and that's it. They've done it [before].\" West Ham and manager David Moyes continue to defy expectations. After winning last season's Europa Conference League and selling Rice for a club-record fee, they now find themselves in sixth place on 33 points, the highest figure they have ever collected at this stage of a Premier League season. No wonder Moyes suggested the club is \"getting ready to talk\" about a new contract with his existing deal expiring at the end of the season. Thursday was West Ham's first win in this fixture since 2015 and, more remarkably, Moyes' first league away win at Arsenal, [Chelsea](/football/team?id=363), [Liverpool](/football/team?id=364) or [Manchester United](/football/team?id=360) in 73 attempts. \"Football is played in many ways and tonight we did the part that maybe isn't talked about as much,\" said Moyes. \"Brilliant defending. We did a good job on Arsenal tonight. They had lots of the ball, too much for my liking, but we did a great job.\" Asked about his team's aspirations for 2024, Moyes added: \"We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team.\" Arsenal, meanwhile, are in a different place. They believe they can be the top team. But this defeat showed there is more work to do.",

    "text": "A new type of dietary fat that doesn’t require animals or large areas of land to produce could soon be on sale in the US as researchers and entrepreneurs race to develop the first “synthetic” foodstuffs. US start-up Savor has created a “butter” product made from carbon, in a thermochemical system closer to fossil fuel processing than food production. “There is no biology involved in our specific process,” says [Kathleen Alexander](https://archive.ph/o/L35cY/https://www.savor.it/) from the firm. … Synthetic fats could revolutionise the food system by providing calories while freeing up land for conservation and carbon storage, says Alexander. Products made this way could also provide a food source in the event of environmental disaster. “If we had an emergency, this could feed the whole planet for a really long time,” she says. If the process of synthetic fat production is powered with renewable energy and made using captured carbon as a feedstock, it could be “dramatically better than anything we are doing in agriculture today”, says [Steven Davis](https://archive.ph/o/L35cY/https://sustainablesolutions.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, the lead author of the study. He thinks synthetic foods could offer climate benefits. “I don’t think we will get to the point where we are making all our food synthetically, but if we could make a dent in it by synthesising things like these otherwise quite-greenhouse-gas-intensive oil crops such as palm oil and soybeans, we could really reduce the amount of land that we need for our food supply,” he says.",
