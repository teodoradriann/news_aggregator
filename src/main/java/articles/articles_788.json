    "text": "Using AI for Social Good Most people use artificial intelligence for things like online searching and shopping, chatbots, navigation, image generation, and more. LMU senior Gavin Butts ’25 wants to use AI for social good.\nA statistics & data science and computer science double major, who’s also minoring in math, Butts’ interest in research was first sparked by a project with LMU Seaver College Prof. Junyuan Lin . The project, which focused on the women’s soccer team, explored the impact of various factors on athlete training, competition readiness, and performance. Their research was not only part of LMU’s Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) , but it was also presented in Tokyo, Japan, and it won best poster at the Southern California Conference of Applied Math (SOCAMS). For Butts, the experience also highlighted the intersection of social justice and his studies, inspiring him to pursue research as a career.\n“This was my first chance to ever incorporate both social justice initiatives with what I’m studying, and I think getting that experience first hand – like, this is something I can do, and this is something I could live doing – that’s not something I ever considered, and that’s just something I’d love to explore further,” Butts said.\nLearn More About LMU Undergraduate Programs Outside of the classroom, Butts, who also serves as the Vice President for Service with LMU’s Ignatians Service Organization , credits his involvement with the group and its focus on social reform, abolition initiatives, and working with disadvantaged communities, for further igniting his passion for social justice.\nButts hopes to one day use what he’s learned inside the classroom with statistics, data science, and computer science to explore AI ethics and research other social justice causes, including how AI can be used for prison reform.\n“I think it would be really interesting to be able to explore how AI can help these people, and instead of using AI to put people in the system… how can we use AI to help rehabilitate people?”",

    "text": "Americans Optimistic About Future Social Security Benefits Gallup poll that shows that Americans are feeling more upbeat about future social security benefits, relative to recent years More Americans expect to receive Social Security when they retire, according to a recent Gallup [survey](https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx). Yet, 43% of retirees currently expect that their benefits will eventually be cut. The new poll also found that expectations for receiving Social Security benefits vary by age among nonretirees, with 66% of those 50 and older expecting to get benefits. Only 37% of nonretirees between 30 and 49 believe they will get Social Security benefits, while 61% do not. Of the youngest adults, aged 18 to 29, 50% think they will get benefits (up from 34% in 2015), and 48% do not. That’s the most optimistic this age group has been at any point since 2000. Gallup noted that preserving Social Security largely called on raising payroll taxes of current workers, curbing benefits for current and/or future recipients and possibly raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits (currently 67 years old). And while U.S. adults have typically favored raising Social Security taxes rather than curbing benefits to sustain the system long-term, they are more likely to favor tax increases now than in the past.

Uncertainty About Maximizing Social Security Benefits The survey showed that only 8% of respondents understood [how to maximize their Social Security benefits](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security). For example, only 13% of respondents correctly guessed their full retirement age based on their birth year. On average, they said it was 60 years of age. Generation Z and millennials thought the retirement age was 54 and 55, respectively. Also, nearly half (49%) of adults also incorrectly believed that if they filed for Social Security early, their benefits would automatically increase once they reached their full retirement age. Changes for 2024 According to [Kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/social-security-changes-in-new-year), on January 1, several 2024 Social Security changes are going into effect, which will impact outline how to maximize benefits and what beneficiaries will receive and how they will qualify. - The Cost of Living Adjustment [(](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/COLA-increase-2024) [COLA](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/COLA-increase-2024) [)](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/social-security/COLA-increase-2024)for 2024 is 3.2%. That means recipients will see their monthly payments rise by that amount for the new year. On average, that equals more than $50 per month, per the SSA. - Wealthy taxpayers may see higher taxes in the new year, as the [Social Security tax wage base](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/social-security-tax-wage-base-jumps)in 2024 rises by 5.2%. - In 2024, you can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. However, you are entitled to full benefits when you reach your full retirement age (FRA). - If you are below the FRA and still earning an income from working while collecting Social Security, the SSA will withhold $1 for every $2 above a set amount, which is [$22,320](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/rtea.html)in 2024.

    "text": "Illegal Marijuana Sales Still Big, Even in States Where Pot Is Legal\nBy Dan Nosowitzon June 22, 2021\nMany assumed that legalization would kneecap the illegal marijuana industry. It hasn’t yet.\nWith recreational marijuana now legal in more than a dozen states (and Washington, D.C.), legal dispensaries are common across the country.\nOne of the assumptions about the legalization of recreational marijuana held that once legal dispensaries were common, the illicit trade would be unable to compete. After all, why would anyone want to purchase something illegally, and theoretically without safety regulations, when it could be found just as easily legally?\nThis has not turned out to be true. In\nCalifornia, Illinois, Massachusetts and other states with legal recreational dispensaries, black market marijuana sales not only continue, but often outpace legal sales. Huge busts of illegal operations regularly make the news and in response, California recently approved a $100 million plan to aid the state’s legal marijuana industry—an industry that was supposed to be an untapped goldmine.\nOne of the biggest issues for legal marijuana businesses appears to be a copious helping of red tape. California has a complex, expensive, multi-step and mandatory environmental review process for marijuana growers, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, about 82 percent of the state’s cannabis licensees only have a provisional license, which lasts for one year and cannot be renewed. California governor Gavin Newsom has, separately from this $100 million plan, proposed an extension to allow those licensees to transition—again, at significant expense and difficulty—to a full license.\nBut marijuana farms, far from the ideal of hippie virtue,\nhave long been associated with significant environmental damage: water theft, endemic animal deaths, destruction of habitat and pesticide drenching. Much of that was due to the fact that marijuana wasn’t legal to grow for so long; if you were growing marijuana, it didn’t matter much if you also killed a bunch of native weasels. But the fact remains that these operations absolutely need significant environmental regulation; it’s just taking forever to get it. The Los Angeles Times reports that some licensees wait multiple years for approval, thanks to under-staffing and limited resources.\nThere are other problems, too. Marijuana was hailed as a tax wonder for states: a valuable and popular product that could finally be taxed, providing revenue for the government. But those taxes, in addition to the standard cost of regular businesses (labor, rent, that kind of thing), mean that legal marijuana is\ntypically significantly more expensive than illegal. And unlike with many disrupted industries, the illegal marijuana industry was already generally pretty convenient, operated through texting and delivery. Plus, marijuana retailers in many states, including California, are allowed on a city-by-city basis. Illegal retailers aren’t allowed anywhere, but exist everywhere.\nThis stuff is, hopefully, all temporary: eventually the kinks in the legal industry will get smoothed out and made more efficient. But for now, that $100 million could go a long way, provided it actually can assist the CEQA to be quicker.\nI don’t want to be in the black market Cannabis business, I want to be in the Grey market Cannabis business, Keeps you out of jail 😤",

Kennedy Jr. apuntado por Trump. Tiene 70 años, es sobrino del presidente asesinado John F. Kennedy, y no tiene formación científica. Es conocido por propagar teorías de la conspiración, especialmente sobre las vacunas contra el COVID-19.",
