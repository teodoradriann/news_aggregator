    "text": "For those who would like to make a difference to the health of the Uncompahgre River and its watershed, the next couple of weeks offer a few opportunities. The settings for both events are stunning and wildly different. The first takes place this Saturday (Oct. 5) at Ridgway State Park. The one Oct. 12 will be held at Ouray Ice Park. Both are hosted by the Uncompahgre Watershed Partnership (UWP), the Ridgway nonprofit whose mission is to help protect the river and its habitat. This Saturday, the UWP will be partnering with Colorado Parks and Wildlife at Ridgway State Park for a cleanup event at Ridgway Reservoir from 9 a.m.-12 p.m. Meet inside the Dutch Charlie Entrance at the marina boat ramp if you would like to come along, after registering at [uncompaghrewatershed.org](http://uncompaghrewatershed.org). All ages are welcome. Heather Patterson, co-owner of Ridgway’s RIGS Fly Shop & Guide Service, is passionate about this place — and this cleanup. “We have a personal attachment to Ridgway State Park, given that we were the first outfitter permitted here,” she said. “It is an amazing resource that the whole community uses,” and the challenge is that it is getting ever busier. “Now that the state has made it so much easier to access with a cheap pass” — which costs just $29, compared to $80 annually when you register a vehicle through the Division of Motor Vehicles — “more people are taking advantage, rafting or kayaking into the reservoir, fishing at Pa-Co-Chu-Puk, or paddleboarding on the Dallas Creek reservoir section of the park. Whether you’re in favor of dams or not, it’s an amazing resource that people use all the time. From my paddleboard, I’ve witnessed a dragonfly migration cross down from Log Hill and head across the water; I’ve seen a black bear swimming in Dallas Creek. The high country can feel inaccessible to some. What’s amazing and unique about this place is that it is so accessible to so many.” Yet along with “the human imprint,” as Patterson put it, “comes human trash. Last year, we collected everything from monofilament fishing lines to baby diapers, cans and bottles and other assorted trash to an abandoned tire,” Patterson said. “The more people get a sense of what’s being left behind and what the human impact is — it makes a difference” when it comes to our continued motivation to protect these special places. “We had about 30 volunteers come help last year, and we hope for more this Saturday,” Patterson said. Adding to the allure are the swag and free refreshments (the day’s top trash collector will receive a free Black Hole duffel by Patagonia). What’s more, many participants are likely to enjoy a free pontoon ride “to a place where only watercraft can get to,” Patterson said. “You’ll get to see a side of the park that you maybe have never experienced. Last year we had volunteers at Paco, Dutch Charlie, and Dallas Creek. Everybody was everywhere.” All ages are welcome. Next Saturday brings cleanup event number two. Titled “Love Your Gorge,” the annual get-together in and around Ouray Ice Park will be held from 9 a.m.-1:30 p.m. This will be a more-strenuous gathering than the one in Ridgway, held at a higher elevation — Ouray Ice Park goes to 8500’, compared to the waters surrounding Ridgway State Park, which are around 7000’ — and may require different gear. While volunteers at both events should bring sunglasses, hats, proper hiking boots and work gloves, for example, “those working in the gorge will be required to wear helmets,” the UWP’s website notes. “In 2024, we will be removing litter from inside the gorge and along the roads and trails, spreading wood chips on trails, installing weed-information kiosks and planting a couple of trees. Volunteers will also learn about, and give input on, the South Ouray Erosion Control Project.” The three-hour event concludes “with lunch, giveaways and a tour of the park.” Register to attend at [uncompahgrewatershedpartnership.org](http://uncompahgrewatershedpartnership.org).",

    "text": "USATSI ARLINGTON, Texas -- With a 1:41 to go Saturday at AT&T Stadium, the Dallas Cowboys led the NFC North champion Detroit Lions 20-13 while the Lions were out of timeouts.\nThat's a situation anyone who is a part of Cowboys nation would take in a heartbeat since they would assume 99 times out of 100 with their NFL-best pass rush (45.1% quarterback pressure rate, best in the NFL) powered by Micah Parsons (102 quarterback pressures, most in the NFL) that they would be a shoo-in to fluster an opposing offense that needed to pass to keep the game going. Well, the Cowboys did hang on for a 20-19 victory , but they came oh so close to losing the game.\nThe Lions offense marched 75 yards in nine plays across a minute and 18 seconds, and the scoring strike was from quarterback Jared Goff to wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for 11 yards.\nAMON-RA! The @Lions are within 1 with :27 to go 👀\n📺: #DETvsDAL on ESPN/ABC\n📱: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/urKeZaIvCL pic.twitter.com/s8WHAhqk8J\n— NFL (@NFL) December 31, 2023 Then, madness ensued. Detroit went for two and the win, and they appeared to have it after Goff completed a pass to offensive tackle Taylor Decker, number 68. However, Detroit reported tackle Dan Skipper, number 70. as eligible prior to the play, according to referee Brad Allen. Despite that not being how the Lions interpreted that moment playing out , that was the call on the field.\nTherefore, the Lions were called for an illegal touching penalty. The Cowboys were in turn called for an infraction with Micah Parsons being called for being offsides on the second try, a play in which Dallas intercepted Goff. Finally, the sequence concluded with Dallas forcing an incomplete pass to hang on for the win.\n\"I haven't been a part of one like that,\" Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said postgame Saturday night. \"I can only die three times. I don't know if I can die four, but a great game. Hats off to Detroit. They fight you all the way as they did tonight, but I love the way our guys followed through, finished as Coach [McCarthy] says. Was really proud of our guys and they made it tough on us right out until the last play, obviously.\"\nJones, despite being the billionaire owner of the world's most valuable sports franchise, turned into a regular fan at the moment, needing to look away during the series of events.\n\"I just lost it twice,\" Jones said. \"Lost it the first time and really had just almost shut my mind and eyes to it. But when we got a second time, it seemed like too much. And then of course our guys played well and fought hard enough....That was a tough team, big ball game. We won't play a tougher team in the playoffs in my mind. Not a tougher [one].\"\nDallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy observed the sequence to be similar to something he would run his team through in August during training camp out in Oxnard, California.\n\"That was a two-point extravaganza,\" McCarthy said postgame Saturday night. \"It looked like training camp. Go at it for three or four plays.\"\nHad the Lions converted, Dallas would have gotten the football back down a point with 23 seconds remaining and one timeout, a scenario Dak Prescott would have welcomed after watching the balance of the game seesaw back and forth.\n\"At that point, I was like 'just give me the ball with 20 seconds and a timeout',\" Prescott said postgame Saturday night. \"I was just itching really at that point. Obviously thinking the first one they scored. The second one we got the interception, but I saw the jump [offsides] as well. To us getting the stop on the last one, it was just a roller coaster, a roller coaster of thoughts and that sense of 'let me get the ball.' From earlier with the punt conversion they got to one of the early fourth downs, I said 'this guy is crazy.' Respect with the craziness talking about Coach [Dan] Campbell. I love it. I really do. You're playing to win a game and not lose a game. That's what he did tonight. Credit that mindset. That's a helluva team. I wouldn't be surprised if we see them again [in the playoffs].\"\nGiven rookie kicker Brandon Aubrey has drained all 35 of his field goal attempts, the Cowboys' single-season franchise record, his teammates had all the confidence in the world in his ability to drain a game winner if they were able to get him in range.\n\"We have a hell of a kicker,\" Prescott said. \"But yeah, a lot of emotions. Want to finish with the ball in your hand, [we] don't do that. They get the ball back, and they're on the drive. Then, the three players with a two-point conversion. At that point I just wanted to know if they were in or were they not, just let me know if we need to go back out there. Like I said, we had time on the clock. Had a hell of a kicker with a timeout that I felt confident and comfortable on our plan and the things that we practice that we would have been able to get in position for him to take an attempt at a game winner. But hell of a job with the defense. Some things played into that, and they finished it the right way.\"\nDallas defense frustrated to be in two-point conversion battle at the end of the game In the end, the Cowboys defense was able to exhale after getting the game's final stop to preserve the 20-19 win. However, Dallas felt they shouldn't have even been in a situation to need to defend against a potential game-winning two-point conversion by the Lions. The drive prior, safety Donovan Wilson made a diving interception to give the Cowboys offense the ball back inside the Detroit 30.\nWILSON! A pick for the @dallascowboys with just over 2 min to go\n📺: #DETvsDAL on ESPN/ABC\n📱: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/urKeZaIvCL pic.twitter.com/sNsGL4eEx0\n— NFL (@NFL) December 31, 2023 After being derailed by a tripping penalty, the team settled for a field goal to go up seven. Not creating a similar type of turnover or stop on the final drive left the Cowboys' fifth-ranked scoring defense (19.1 points per game allowed) furious.\n\"You know it's definitely mind boggling, but you know it's just more frustrating to be in the position to win the game like that,\" Dallas Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons said postgame on Saturday. \"That's where that frustration comes from, and I don't even feel like we should have been in that position. Just how much we put into two-minute, how we pride ourselves on getting stops in the game, so there's definitely some things I feel like we got to fix.\"\nSome of that anger stems from a similar situation unfolding just last week in a 22-20 last-second loss at the Miami Dolphins in Week 16. Prescott threw a go-ahead touchdown to Brandin Cooks on Dallas' final offensive drive of that game, but Miami ended up with a game-winning 29-yard field goal as time expired after getting the ball back with 3:27 on the clock.\n\"That's something that we got to look at, for me it's frustrating,\" Parsons said of the team's two-minute defense. \"I don't know what's going on, I know everybody sees what I'm facing and dealing with, but we got to look at it and get better from it because to be a championship team we have to get those type of stops.\"\nThat annoyance boiled over into the locker room postgame, causing defensive coordinator Dan Quinn to step in and cool Parsons off, reminding him of the fortunate situation the team is in: being able to correct things after emerging victorious.\n\"Obviously, I was frustrated,\" Parsons said when talking about the aftermath following how the Lions' final drive unfolded. \"I came in here [the locker room] like 'damn, how we give this up?' Dan [Quinn] is like 'man, don't worry about it. He's like 'it's better to get to fix things coming off of a win versus last week where we were trying to fix things off of a loss.' I said 'you're right.'... When it comes down to that end of the game, we have to be better there.\"\nOur Latest NFL Stories Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb rewrites record books Garrett Podell • 7 min read CBS Sports' top 23 headline-making moments of 2023 CBS Sports Staff • 16 min read Saints' Allen, Carr expected back, OC change possible Jonathan Jones • 2 min read Struggling Chiefs to change some players' roles Jonathan Jones • 2 min read Taylor says he told refs before Lions' two-point play Bryan DeArdo • 1 min read NFL playoff picture, standings in Week 17 Jeff Kerr • 7 min read Watch Now: Cowboys survive to hang on at home Garrett Podell 6 min read Week 17 best bets from all our experts Jordan Dajani 15 min read New Year's resolutions for all 32 teams in '24 Cody Benjamin 9 min read Prisco's picks: Ravens edge Dolphins Pete Prisco 6 min read Bold predictions: Rudolph stays hot Garrett Podell 6 min read Lions react to controversial 2-point conversion penalty Bryan DeArdo 1 min read Saints' Allen, Carr expected back, OC change possible Jonathan Jones 2 min read Struggling Chiefs to change some players' roles Jonathan Jones 2 min read These six teams can clinch a playoff spot in Week 17 John Breech 3 min read Russ: Broncos said change contract or face benching Tyler Sullivan 2 min read",

    "text": "Vancouver resident Robert Ford was heading to a yoga class Sunday morning when he smelled an odour he likened to \"semi-burnt fuel.\" As a member of council at his Kitsilano apartment building, he said he decided to check the boiler room, but it smelled fine. \"I was expecting something in there, so that was strange. I scratched my head and I went to the front door, which is right across from the beach, and it was 10 times more powerful outside,\" he said. He immediately began searching online for an explanation but didn't find any answers until almost four hours later. \"I'm just kind of perplexed at how we can have such a nasty event with no public information hardly,\" he said. It was one of two acrid odours that spread over parts of Metro Vancouver in less than a week, raising questions about corporate responsibility to inform the public when such events cause widespread concern and confusion but fall short of health and safety breaches. The smell Ford referred to was revealed to be \"an unplanned issue\" with a Parkland fuel refinery processing unit in neighbouring Burnaby. The heavy stench, which Ford compared to jet fuel, blanketed parts of Metro Vancouver and caused more than 100 complaints from local residents. It came just days after a \"controlled release of gas\" from a FortisBC interconnect station in nearby Delta, B.C., prompted criticisms from Mayor George Harvie and numerous residents that the utility didn't notify the public for more than four hours. Harvie said the heavy odour caused stress and panic in the community, and a flood of calls to local police and fire departments hampered Delta's emergency response services. A statement from Fortis said it was investigating after an elevated level of the odorant added to natural gas was unknowingly sent out in a controlled release of gas. Carol Liao, a University of B.C. Sauder fellow at the Dhillon centre for business ethics, said these incidents are not necessarily matters for legislation, but rather about accountability and ethics. \"Businesses obviously need to obey bylaws, but they also need to understand that beyond that, there is a need to act responsibly to maintain public trust,\" she said. \"If a business is the cause of a terrible odour that's impacting the surrounding community and beyond, it should act as a good corporate citizen and own up to the problem right away, alert public officials, alert those possibly impacted and in harm's way, mitigate the damage and be accountable.\" Harvie said he was involved in both incidents as Delta's mayor and as chair of Metro Vancouver's regional district. \"The difference between the two was (in) Metro Vancouver, air quality inspectors were on scene at the refinery, so we had more accurate information being fed back to us,\" he said. Metro Vancouver monitors emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide from the Parkland refinery, and the district has said air quality objectives for the contaminants weren't exceeded Sunday. But, Harvie said the Fortis incident was different. \"The one from Fortis was very disturbing to me and it does speak a lot about corporate values (and) corporate responsibilities. They kept the information away from us,\" he said. \"This was just unacceptable.\" Harvie took to the social media site X after the smell covered an area stretching from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to more than 30 kilometres away in Vancouver. The mayor said he had contacted FortisBC requesting an urgent followup meeting. The Fortis statement released on Wednesday said work was being performed on new equipment, which was not connected to the gas system, and while a controlled release of gas was planned, the release of odour was not. \"Further review is underway to determine why there was an elevated level of odorant in the equipment,\" it said. \"Although the controlled release of gas at the interconnect station on Jan. 16 contained an elevated level of this odorant, it is not harmful and there are no immediate or long-term health effects.\" Fortis said it had been in contact with local First Nations, municipal and emergency officials, including Harvie, as well as government regulators, to provide information on its response. \"We have also started a review of the incident and are working with relevant stakeholders during this process.\" Kevin Farrow, technical director of Parkland, said in an interview that the refinery had paused processing operations earlier this month due to extreme cold weather. \"It was during that restart of the refinery, that one of the processing units had a plugged line, which ultimately led to the plume and odour that many experienced on Sunday,\" he said. \"We've launched a review to better understand the root cause of what happened and how we got into this situation.\" Parkland had issued an advisory on its website two days before the plume, alerting people who live nearby that they may notice noise and \"higher than usual flare\" from the facility. In a timeline created by the refinery and sent to The Canadian Press, the company said the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. Sunday. It said Metro Vancouver had been notified by 8:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m., the Burnaby Fire Department and the RCMP had created a perimeter around the facility as a safety precaution. The RCMP was called off at 11:26 a.m., while the fire department remained in place until 3:15 p.m., the timeline said. The refinery's first public statement Sunday was issued at 11 a.m., notifying the public of an incident that cause elevated smoke, odours and particulate matter. That was followed up at 12:30 p.m. with a media advisory, announcing the shut down of operations. While some, including Ford in Kitsilano, believe communication needs to come sooner to alleviate panic, Farrow said the \"priority\" of the refinery is to \"communicate accurate and confirmed information to the public.\" \"We have that information now,\" he said. \"We understand more, and we've begun to reach out to our community partners and to our neighbours, (and) you can expect a lot more information from the refinery in the coming days and weeks.\" Farrow noted the refinery remains shut down but the company announced it would be conducting a \"controlled and necessary operational procedure\" on Thursday. \"We do not expect any impacts of the community. We're just making them aware, just in case anything were to occur,\" Farrow said. Metro Vancouver also issued an updated air quality bulletin Wednesday night, saying it \"will be closely monitoring\" as the refinery conducts the operation \"that may result in odour, smoke and flaring.\" While some residents expressed concern about the announcement online, Liao applauded the move, saying an advanced public statement can be \"immensely helpful in ensuring transparency and accountability to the surrounding communities.\" \"It helps avoid any public confusion and the tying up of resources such as 911 calls, while also mitigating risk,\" she said.

    "text": "EE.UU. reduce personal en embajada de Irak, Bagdad, ante creciente tensión con Irán\nWashington retira personal diplomático en Irak como medida preventiva ante posible escalada de conflicto.\nWASHINGTON.- El gobierno estadounidense confirmó este miércoles una reducción significativa de personal en su embajada en Bagdad, dejando solo un destacamento esencial, como medida preventiva ante el incremento de tensiones con Irán. La decisión refleja la creciente preocupación por posibles represalias mientras continúan las negociaciones nucleares entre ambos países, actualmente en un punto crítico.\nEl Departamento de Estado justificó la medida como parte del compromiso del presidente Donald Trump con la seguridad de los ciudadanos estadounidenses en el extranjero.\nAdemás, se autorizó al personal no esencial en las embajadas de Manama (Baréin) y Kuwait a abandonar sus puestos si lo consideran necesario, señalando un escalamiento en la región.\nAmenazas cruzadas: ¿Hacia un conflicto abierto?\nLa decisión de EE.UU. llega horas después de que el ministro de Defensa iraní, Aziz Nasirzadeh, advirtiera que su país atacará “todas las bases estadounidenses en Medio Oriente” si las negociaciones nucleares fracasan y Washington lanza una ofensiva.\nEsta declaración responde a las reiteradas amenazas de Trump, quien ha insistido en que no descarta una acción militar si Irán no cede en sus demandas.\nEl Consejo Supremo de Seguridad Nacional iraní también amenazó con atacar instalaciones nucleares “ocultas” de Israel si Teherán es atacado primero. Estas declaraciones reflejan un juego de tensiones peligrosas, donde cualquier error de cálculo podría desencadenar un conflicto regional.\nNegociaciones nucleares: Un camino lleno de obstáculos\nLas conversaciones entre EE.UU. e Irán, que comenzaron el 12 de abril, enfrentan grandes desacuerdos. La sexta ronda de negociaciones estaba prevista para esta semana, pero ni siquiera hay consenso sobre la fecha exacta, lo que demuestra las profundas diferencias.\nIsrael, por su parte, ha presionado para que Occidente adopte una postura más dura, llegando a sugerir un ataque preventivo contra las instalaciones nucleares iraníes. Esta postura agresiva añade más presión a un escenario ya de por sí volátil.\nTe puede interesar: Juez anula intento de Trump por deportar a activista Mahmoud Khalil de la Universidad de Columbia detenido por protestas propalestinas\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.
