    "title": "BTA :: Disorder in Plenary Hall as MPs Try to Debate on Changes Concerning Coal-fired Plants’ Future, Sitting Fails",
    "text": "site.btaDisorder in Plenary Hall as MPs Try to Debate on Changes Concerning Coal-fired Plants’ Future, Sitting Fails On Thursday, the National Assembly’s agenda included a debate on the updated roadmap for climate neutrality and revisions to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) in its Low-carbon Economy component and REPowerEU chapter. Also on the agenda were changes in the Bar Act vetoed by the President on September 20. However, lack of quorum resulted in the parliamentary sitting being postponed several times. When a quorum was eventually reached in 9 pm, MPs of Vazrazhdane and There is Such a People (TISP) blocked the rostrum to prevent the debate. After nearly an hour of disorder in the plenary hall, National Assembly Chair Raya Nazaryan called a break and a meeting of Parliament’s presiding body. Afterwards, the sitting was terminated due to lack of quorum. The lack of quorum throughout the day was caused by the Vazrazhdane, BSP, and There Is Such a People (TISP) groups, after at the start of Thursday’s sitting they failed to get the amendments concerning the future of the Maritsa East Mines complex removed from Parliament’s agenda. From the overtaken rostrum, Iskra Mihaylova MP of Vazrazhdane explained that the roadmap is a key energy document determining how Bulgaria’s coal-fired plants will be closed down in time and be replaced with renewable energy sources. During the plenary sitting, miners gathered outside the National Assembly's building to protest against the draft amendments. Earlier in the day, parliamentary Energy Committee Chairman Delyan Dobrev (GERB-UDF) told a news briefing that the revisions are for BGN 500 million to be allocated under the NRRP to the recultivation of Maritsa East Mines' terrains, which will be given to a State-owned company to be set up for this purpose alone. The company will fund the mines themselves, the concessionaires so that they can restore and recultivate the terrains. Once that happens, the ownership will be transferred to the company, which will manage the EU resources for restoration and recultivation. The process is expected to be completed within this year and have the financial resource allocated under the NRRP. The new company will be entirely State-owned and represented by the Energy Minister. In the name of transparency in the resources' spending, the management bodies of the company will include trade union representatives. Once the recultivation is completed, the company's future will be up to the National Assembly alone. What will happen with the terrains themselves once the company becomes their owner, will be considered at a later stage. Thursday's sitting was supposed to be the last for the 50th National Assembly, as the election campaign for the October 27 snap general elections begins on Friday. /DS/ Additional news.modal.image.header news.modal.image.text news.modal.download.header news.modal.download.text news.modal.header news.modal.text",

    "text": "Due uomini hanno parlato con Euronews, in forma di anonimato, del motivo per cui sono fuggiti dalla leva obbligatoria in Ucraina Dall&#039;inizio dell&#039;invasione russa in Ucraina sono centinaia di migliaia i soldati russi e ucraini, tra cui anche ungheresi e rom, morti in guerra. Due uomini ungheresi-ucraini della Transcarpazia nascosti nell&#039;Ucraina occidentale, hanno raccontato a Euronews, in forma di anonimato, di come sono riusciti a eludere la leva militare e combattere al fronte. Nei primi giorni di guerra nel febbraio 2022 numerosi uomini di etnia ungherese della Transcarpazia, regione ucraina confinante con Slovacchia, Ungheria e Romania, sono fuggiti in Ungheria per sottrarsi all&#039;obbligo di combattere. Alcuni di loro hanno deciso di rimanere per non lasciarsi la vita alle spalle. A Uzhhorod, in Transcarpazia, ad aumentare con l&#039;invasione russa in Ucraina sono state le tangenti per non andare a combattere e le salme sepolte accanto al cimitero del Calvario della città. La storia di chi è riuscito a eludere la leva militare in Ucraina Chi è riuscito a eludere la leva militare è costretto costantemente a prendere delle precauzioni per ogni singolo spostamento incluso quello per andare a lavoro. Se preso in flagrante l&#039;uomo sa già che verrà trasferito a centinaia di chilometri di distanza in un ufficio di reclutamento lo stesso giorno. In oltre due anni si è però creata una rete di persone pronte a collaborare tra di loro e comunicare la presenza di posti di blocco. Chi viene fermato ha due possibilità: andare a combattere o pagare.",

    "title": "Conservatives to Host Event Warning of Dangers of Ranked Choice Voting",
    "text": "Conservatives are hosting an event in Wisconsin on Saturday to warn of the dangers of ranked choice voting, Breitbart News has learned. Ranked choice voting is also known as “instant runoff voting” and involves allowing voters to rank candidates as their first, second, and third choice candidates (and so on) in the order they prefer them. However, conservatives are holding a “Dangers of Ranked Choice Voting grassroots seminar” at WhirlyBall Brookfield in Brookfield, Wisconsin, to warn of what has been described to Breitbart News as “the background, mechanics, and modern day disenfranchisement of thousands of voters in states as a result of the use of ranked choice voting.” Describing it as an “eye-opening discussion on the potential pitfalls of ranked choice voting,” the event’s summary urges attendees to “learn about the complexities and consequences of this voting system from our expert speakers.” Such speakers include state Sen. Duey Stroebel, Joe Giganti of The Regular Joe Show, Waukesha County Clerk Meg Wartman, Voter References’ Gina Swoboda, the Honest Elections Project Action’s Jason Snead, American Constitutional Rights Union Action’s Lori Roman, America First Policy Institute’s Jordan Kittleson, Turning Point Action’s Brett Galaszewski, Save Our States’ Trent England, and the MacIver Institute for Public Policy’s Annette Olson. According to a description of the event previewed to Breitbart News, the discussions will also focus on the “dark money push” from “out-of-state multi millionaires like Katherine Gehl to influence legislators into adopting this system statewide” in states such as Wisconsin. In the last legislative session in Wisconsin, Senate Bill 528 to legalize Final Five/Ranked Choice Voting was heard in the Senate Elections Committee. According to analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau: Under current law, electors voting in a partisan primary may select the party whose candidates they wish to vote for and may cast votes for candidates only within that political party. The single candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for each office within each party is nominated to appear on the general election ballot. Independent candidates and candidates of minor parties that do not qualify for a separate party ballot, column, or row do not appear on the partisan primary ballot. This bill provides that electors may vote in the primary for U.S. senator and representative in Congress for any candidate regardless of party affiliation, and the five persons who receive the greatest numbers of votes for each such office are nominated to appear on the general election ballot. Under the bill, independent candidates for such offices and candidates of minor parties appear on the top-five primary ballot, and electors may vote for these candidates in the same manner as other candidates. noted , “Opponents say ranked-choice voting results in ballots being thrown out, leaving some voters without a say in an election if they don’t rank all the candidates and the ones they do rank are eliminated.”",

    "title": "Utah Ski Resorts Bounce Back With 80+ Inch Storm",
    "text": "Utah residents: this won't be news to you. You're living it. To everyone else: ski resorts in Utah just benefitted from an impressive storm cycle that deposited 70 to 80 inches of snow over the past few days. Remember when we were all concerned about the lack of snow in December? You can kiss those fears goodbye for now (if you live in or near Salt Lake City, Utah, that is). Here are a few of the storm totals reported by Utah ski resorts today: Alta Ski Area: 84 inches ( \"holiday weekend\" ) Brighton Resort: 73 inches (last seven days) Deer Valley: 27 inches (last three days) Park City Mountain: 73 inches (last seven days) Powder Mountain: 70 inches (last seven days) Snowbasin: 49 inches ( \"storm\" ) Snowbird: 60 inches (last seven days) Solitude Mountain Resort: 34 inches (last three days) The storm totals, some offered in three-day rather than seven-day formats, vary slightly, with Alta claiming the highest storm cycle snowfall amount. Presumably, the resorts that only report in three-day increments received somewhere in the 70 to 80-inch range over the past week. The snow was primarily concentrated in and around the Cottonwood Canyons, with ski resorts outside the Salt Lake City bubble receiving less snowfall. Brian Head Resort in southern Utah saw eight inches of snow in the past 72 hours. The heavy snowfall wasn't all hassle-free powder skiing for the Cottonwood Canyon and Cottonwood Canyon-adjacent resorts. Alta Ski Area faced a 34-hour interlodge (a safety precaution where everyone must remain inside because of avalanche risk) over the long weekend. Powder Mountain temporarily closed late last week due to frigid temperatures. I imagine the locals considered these delays minor compared to the thrill of skiing feet upon feet of fresh snow, though. And the best part? Another storm is blowing into the Salt Lake City area tonight that could deposit up to a foot of snow on Wednesday at multiple ski resorts. Don't miss another headline from POWDER!

    "text": "Amid tough competition from some of Colorado’s best wrestlers, Fort Morgan’s grapplers still found ways to pick up a few wins at the Gary Daum Classic at Niwot High School on Saturday.\nThe packed gym, which housed 259 competitors, saw Pueblo County run away with the team victory.\n175-pounder Noah Aguirre led the way for the Mustangs, as he barreled his way through his weight class — thanks to two pins and a 5-0 decision — before finishing runner-up to Berthoud’s KalebCooper, who pinned him in the second period.\nCarson Roth (190), who earned a bye in the first round of his bracket, battled all the way to the end of his first match with Berthoud’s Ben Schroeder before losing in a 5-2 decision. He won his next three matches to secure himself a spot in the third-place match, where Schroeder once again took him down, this time with a 7-3 decision.\nConner Derry, at 106 pounds, pinned his first two opponents from Resurrection Christian and Berthoud, then lost a few more matches to guys from Thornton, Pueblo county and Horizon. He placed sixth in his weight class.\nCristofer Juan, at 113s, won his first match with a first-round pin of Frederick’s Giavanni Anher, but couldn’t handle what Pueblo County’s Brogan Bartholomew threw at him in his quarterfinals match. As he worked his way through the consolation bracket, he picked up three more victories in four matches, which helped him secure fifth place.\nBenjamin Fritzler added his name to the list of Fort Morgan placers as he brushed off tough losses to wrestlers from Horizon and Pueblo County to win four more, including his fifth-place contest with Holy Family’s Fisher Reenan, who he defeated 5-2.\nNate Dahl, all the way up in 215, rounded out the Mustangs’s podium finishes with his own sixth-place nod. Mountain View’s Connor Mann proved too much for him to handle in his opening match, but he rebounded nicely with a win over Thompson Valley’s CJ James before hitting brick walls named Trevor Moore (Berthoud) and Carter Harmon (Roosevelt).",

    "text": "There may be as many as 15 million Arabic-speaking Christians living in the Middle East, and they, along with their indigenous Jewish brothers and sisters, had prospered there in relative peace for centuries. Discrimination and violence against these two “religions of the book” did not increase significantly until the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the 19th century.\nAbout 63% of American Arabs practice Christianity of one creed or the other. In the 19th century, their ancestors immigrated to the U.S. from Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Counted among these Christian Arabs are Roman Catholic (35%), Eastern Orthodox (18%) and Protestant (10%), many of whom converted after arriving in the U.S.\nAs a Rotary Fellow in Denmark in 1966, one of the first persons I met was a Palestinian Christian. I mistakenly thought that all Palestinians were Muslim, but I was even more amazed when he said, sadly, that he was stateless. It was inconceivable to me that any person would not have a country to call his or her own.",

    "text": "[United Kingdom](../) ‘Escalation serves no one’: Sir Keir Starmer calls on Israel and Hezbollah to agree ceasefire in address to UN Sir Keir Starmer has called for Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a ceasefire, saying “escalation serves no one”. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the prime minister implored the two sides to “step back from the brink”. It comes after [Israeli](//news.sky.com/topic/israel-5981) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation’s troops would keep “fighting at full force” and that news of a potential ceasefire deal was “not true”. Addressing the nations of the world in New York, Sir Keir said: “I call on Israel and [Hezbollah](//news.sky.com/topic/hezbollah-8356): Stop the violence, step back from the brink.” Israel-Hezbollah latest: [Follow live updates here](//news.sky.com/story/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-latest-sky-news-live-12978800) The [UK prime minister](//news.sky.com/topic/keir-starmer-6820) added: “We need to see an immediate ceasefire to provide space for a diplomatic settlement, and we are working with all partners to that end. “Because further escalation serves no one.” In his speech, Sir Keir said the UN needs to “work together for peace, progress and equality” – including “preventing a regional war in the Middle East”. More criticism of Russia Earlier in his trip to the UN, Sir Keir [criticised Russia for invading Ukraine](//news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-attacks-russia-for-treating-citizens-as-bits-of-meat-to-fling-into-grinder-13221737) in a meeting of the security council. Both the UK and Russia are permanent members of the UN Security Council. Addressing the general assembly, Sir Keir hinted at wanting to take further action against Russia for its invasion. He said: “We must put new energy and creativity, into conflict resolution and conflict prevention, reverse the trend towards ever-greater violence, make the institutions of peace fit for purpose, and hold members to their commitments under the UN Charter.” Addressing the security council previously, Sir Keir said: “The greatest violation of the charter in a generation has been committed by one of this council’s permanent members.” Pension to be invested in climate change During his speech, the prime minister repeated many of his previous pledges on UK domestic policy. However, he did appear to make one new announcement. Sir Keir pledged to put “billions” from pension and insurance funds into “fighting climate change” and “boosting development”. The Labour government has repeatedly said it wants to use more private investment to build growth. Sir Keir added that the plans for pensions and insurance funds would be managed through a new facility at British International Investment – part of the Foreign Office – working alongside the City of London. The prime minister said “innovating”, “thinking differently” and “moving faster” were the sort of approaches needed to deliver benefits into the future. 👉 [Click to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts](//podfollow.com/skynewsdaily) 👈 Just before Sir Keir began speaking, it was confirmed he would [later be meeting Donald Trump](//news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-to-meet-with-donald-trump-to-establish-a-relationship-13222644) ahead of the US election in November.
