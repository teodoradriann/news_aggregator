    "title": "OnePlus Open deal is $200 off in Best Buy's Year-End sale | Digital Trends",
    "text": "Tushar Mehta / Digital Trends Folding phones are the new trend, with a bevy of manufacturers now offering them, including Samsung, Google, and OnePlus. But no folding phone is created equal. You’ll notice that right away by peeking at some of the best folding phones on the market. They differ in regard to features, price, and form. The OnePlus Open is a stand-out with its sleek, attractive design, powerful internals, and triple camera system. We’ll dig into more of the details below, but right now, you should know Best Buy is offering an incredible deal — you can save $200. Normally $1,700, the OnePlus Open 512 GB storage model, with 16 GB of RAM, is available for just $1,500 unlocked. That’s an incredible deal, but you can save even more if you have an eligible trade-in.\nWhy you should buy the OnePlus Open foldable phone With a similar design to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, the OnePlus Open can be closed and used like a traditional candy bar-style phone, or opened up to use as a phablet. In Digital Trends’ review of the OnePlus Open , Christine Romero-Chan, our resident mobile expert, praised many of its features. She loved the compact and lightweight size, the powerful cameras, the beautiful screens, the anti-glare support, and the fast charging. She also highly praised its multitasking capabilities, especially when open. Some minor concerns she had were the hinge and the large camera bump on the back. But even so, it’s clear the OnePlus Open is a best-in-class device in the foldable range.\nWhen unfolded, and with OnePlus’ Open Canvas, you can run up to three apps at a time with ease. The premium 2K-quality displays make it stunning to look at. From the 6.3-inch front display to the 7.8-inch dual 2K displays unfolded, running at 120Hz, there’s a lot to love here.\nRelated Snag a Google Pixel Tablet with charging dock while it’s $100 off Best after-Christmas smartwatch deals: Apple Watch, Garmin, and more The best Android phones in 2023: the 16 best ones you can buy This particular model comes unlocked for use with any carrier or service. It is compatible with GSM SIM kits through Cricket, Tracfone, Metro PCS, Google Fi, Net10, H20, AT&T, and Simple Mobile. It won’t work on CDMA networks like Verizon, Sprint, Boost, Virgin, or others. No SIM card is included, so you’ll have to find a carrier when you’re ready.\nNormally $1,700, the OnePlus Open 16 GB RAM and 512 GB storage model, unlocked, is $1,500, saving you $200 right away. Again, you can save even more with an eligible trade-in at the time of purchase. If you do want to connect the phone to a carrier, with Best Buy’s help, that option is available, too, and it’s $300 off, saving you an extra $100. Either way, these deals aren’t going to last forever, so get in there while you can and ring in the new year the right way.\nEditors' Recommendations Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is 49% off in Amazon’s year-end sale Best After-Christmas Apple Deals: iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook & more The best folding phones in 2023: the 6 best you can buy Apple, Fitbit, Samsung, Garmin smartwatches on sale for Christmas Apple sale: iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook deals for Christmas",

    "text": "God prefers to make people cry than to make us laugh.\nNobody spoils a man’s life like Jesus. Jesus is a killer of all worldly joy. God’s attitude to the world is often lost on many. God hates the world’s system. The world hated Jesus and killed him. Therefore, anyone who is a lover of pleasure; anyone who likes this world, becomes an enemy of God.\nAccordingly, James asks:\n“You adulterers! Don’t you realise that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.” (James 4:4).\n|\n---|\nPaul agrees:\n“She who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.” (1 Timothy 5:6).\nGod is so implacably opposed to the world; He has doomed it to destruction. Isaiah says:\n“I have heard from the Lord God of hosts, a destruction determined even upon the whole earth.” (Isaiah 28:22).\nIn the meantime, God plans “to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.” (Isaiah 23:9).\nGod allows wickedness to prevail on earth, the better to commend to us the superiority of the kingdom of heaven. Job notes that:\n“The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked.” (Job 9:24).\nThis is because God allows it to be so. Thus, God allows the worst kinds of people to be heads of state and governments:\n“The High God rules human kingdoms. He arranges kingdom affairs however He wishes and makes leaders out of losers.” (Daniel 4:17).\nWonder-less World\nThanks to Jesus, we are brought to the realisation that what we deem to be life is death. Under the tutelage of the Holy Spirit, believers are made foreigners and strangers here on decrepit earth; having become citizens of a spiritual heavenly kingdom.\nOut of this new reality is then fashioned a completely different psychology. The atonement kills everything before it makes them come back to life.\nChrist makes every pain irrelevant, and He diminishes every joy outside of Himself. Therefore, be contemptuous of every advantage. Overlook every disadvantage. Jesus is a leveller. The kingdom of God cancels deficits and erases credits. Before the glory of God is revealed:\n“Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill brought low.” (Isaiah 40:4).\nGod is at pains to make us see that what we call wonderful is “wonderless.” He tells us that the man who is blessed is not he who won the lottery, but he who receives the forgiveness of sin:\n“Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him.” (Psalm 32:1-2).\nJesus maintains the joy to be cherished is the joy of salvation:\n“Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you. But don’t rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in heaven.” (Luke 10:19-20).\nMan of Sorrows\nGod prefers to make people cry than to make them laugh. Jesus was a man of sorrows; acquainted with grief. (Isaiah 53:3).The Bible says of Him:\n“It was the Lord’s good plan to crush Him and cause Him grief.” (Isaiah 53:10).\nThere is very little to laugh about here on earth. What is there to laugh about in a world riddled with sin, where souls are perishing every day; and where the thief comes daily to steal, kill, and destroy? (John 10:10). What is there to laugh about in a grief-stricken world?\nTherefore, Jesus pronounces woe on those given to laughter. He says:\n“Woe to you who are full, for you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep” (Luke 6:25).\nAmos also says:\n“Woe to those lounging in luxury at Jerusalem and Samaria.” (Amos 6:1).\nJames goes even further to prescribe a strange tonic for the soul:\n“Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.” (James 4:9).\nBut we thought Jesus came to give us beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness? (Isaiah 61:3).\nYes indeed! But Jesus’ ministry is only for those who are sorrowful and mournful. Moreover, the consolations of Christ come not through the reform of this world, but by invitation to another kingdom, a kingdom not of this world.\nDivine Prescription\nThe nature of this ungodly world is such that, according to the wisdom of God, even in laughter the heart should sorrow, since the end of mirth may be grief. (Proverbs 14:13). Solomon says:\n“Sorrow is better than laughter, for by a sad countenance the heart is made better.” (Ecclesiastes 7:3).\nBy laughter and merriment, the heart is made worse, vainer, more carnal, and sensual. It is made more in love with the world and more estranged from God and godliness.\nIf sorrow is indeed better than laughter, then the man whom God makes sad is more blessed than the happy man. When a man decides to be good to another man, he tries to make him happy. He ministers to his body. He makes him comfortable.\nNot so the goodness of God. When God is good to someone, He is more likely to make him sad. God’s goodness works more on the heart than on the flesh:\n“The goodness of God leads you to repentance.” (Romans 2:4).\nIts main objective is to lead us along the path of life and make us heirs of salvation.\nTherefore, God is not good in the way that is normally considered to be good. If we do not understand the peculiarity of God’s goodness, we are likely to be sad when we should be glad, and to be glad when we should be sad.\nIn the kingdom of God, the way up is down.\nFake Ambassadors\nAn ambassador is sometimes required to tell lies for his country. But is an ambassador for Christ, required to do likewise for the Lord?\nCertainly not!\nHowever, you might be mistaken if you listen to many of the falsehoods propagated in the churches about the gospel of the kingdom of God.\nJesus is the Truth. The gospel is the gospel of truth. Nevertheless, many people feel an effective way to promote the gospel is by telling lies.\nThey make promises on God’s behalf that He never made. They say without Christ there is crisis, implying falsely that the Christian life is crisis-free. They make financial wealth an object of the gospel. They insist God is out to make all Christians billionaires, provided they first give their hard-earned monies as tithes to the churches.\nBut the worst lies of all are those told about God. These lies are told by Christians who reject the knowledge of God and who create God in their image. God says:\n“I have kept quiet while you did these things, so you thought I was just like you.” (Psalm 50:21).\nHowever, it is important never to forget that:\n“God is not a man.” (Numbers 23:19).\nDeceived Psalmist\nA popular refrain in the churches says: “God is good all the time, and all the time, God is good.” But is this true? Does God Himself claim to be good all the time? God is not good in the way that men define goodness.\nBecause we insist foolishly that God is good all the time:\n“We call the proud blessed, for those who do wickedness are raised up; they even tempt God and go free.” (Malachi 3:15).\nThe psalmist says:\n“As for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped. For I was envious of the boastful when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. For there are no pangs in their death, but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other men, nor are they plagued like other men. (Psalm 73:2-5).\nOffensive God\nIn many respects, many of the actions of God in the Old Testament do not conform to human standards of goodness. God Himself warns us, saying:\n“My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:8-9).\nIf God were to be good all the time according to man, the righteous would not die in an accident. Evil men will not prosper. Jesus would not be despised and hated by men. He would not be: “a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel,” and “a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 8:14).\nFor example, in the Old Testament, no case was made against incest. The daughters of Lot had sex with their father and had children with him. (Genesis 19:33-36). Their action and pregnancy could only have happened by the determinate counsel of God.

    "text": "For as long as I can remember I’ve been trying to curb my anxiety and eat better. And a year ago I wasn’t feeling good. I was eating processed food like frozen pizza — anything quick and easy that you could throw in the microwave. I weighed 158 pounds, a lot for me, and I wanted to lose weight. I’m 44 and divorced with a 15-year-old daughter, Cassandra, but I wasn’t spending quality time with her because I was always stressed. I was only sleeping a few hours a night because I was so anxious. I was in a constant state of go, go, go, worrying about everything — a lot of it was about money. I downloaded the Thrive app and started making some changes. I only have one soda a day and I drink more water. I’m cooking proper meals. For dinner, we might have baked chicken or salmon with mixed vegetables and potatoes. For lunch, I’ll have a salad. I decided to eat dinner at an earlier hour and cut out dessert most days. My daughter and I started going for relaxing hikes in the state parks close to us. We live in “God’s country.” It’s very beautiful. We pause to take photos and look at the local wildlife and plants. And we like to go at night to observe the moon and constellations. I walk a lot at work. Getting up and moving has decreased my joint pain, increased my flexibility, and has motivated me to accomplish more throughout each day. My biggest stress by far is money. So with Microsteps, I created a feasible budget to help me live within my means. I cut out unnecessary expenses like snacks and sodas. I find that fresh food is cheaper than processed food. Every month 70 dollars goes automatically into a savings account, and I never even notice it. I don’t do as much online shopping. This year we didn’t take a vacation, and I got rid of my satellite TV subscription. Overall, I’m saving 150 dollars more a month. Tech timeouts are helping me lower my anxiety. I used to spend hours and hours on my phone. But it tracks my usage and now I can see I’m on my phone for three hours less a week than a year ago! Microsteps help me stick to a bedtime routine. My phone goes on the charger and is set to sleep mode from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. This helps me unwind. I’ve cut out most late night snacks and I do deep breathing to stay calm. Instead of being on my phone, I’ll read a book. And I find I’m usually getting seven hours of sleep a night. I’m managing to keep my anxiety under control. I’m decluttering my house which helps me feel more organized. I make a list of small tasks I want to complete each day and do them one by one. But I’ve learned it’s okay if I don’t complete all my tasks, because resting and recharging is just as important. I no longer watch the news every day and that helps me lower my stress levels. My five cats calm me down. I don’t know how they know, but they can always tell when I’m overdoing it. They get in the way and pull at me so I have to put down my phone and spend 15 minutes playing with them, which always makes me relaxed. I’ve also gone back to doing hobbies I enjoy like gardening and painting. I’m focusing on trying to stay in the present, spending time doing things I enjoy. I remind myself that family and fun are just as important as work and making money. By learning how to lower my anxiety I’ve improved all of my relationships. I’ve lost 13 pounds in the past year. When I saw the number on the scale, I felt so happy I almost cried. I had never been successful at losing weight in the past. I have more balance in my life, and less anxiety — I feel happier. — Lori Sassaman, Walmart Supercenter #2024, Tunkhannock, PA; $5K Winner",

    "title": "Netflix's Delicious Course Correction Is Making Studio Trigger's Delicious in Dungeon One of 2024's Early Anime Hits",
    "text": "Netflix recently released a new anime called Delicious in Dungeon that's generated a lot of buzz among the weeb portion of the internet. While it would be easy to lose this show in the sea of seasonal anime releasing this Winter, Delicious in Dungeon stands ahead of its contemporaries for its refreshing exploration of the fantasy anime genre and, more importantly, how Netflix is uniquely handling its release.\nWhat is Delicious in Dungeon and why is it so special? Delicious in Dungeon by Trigger, the animation studio behind Crunchyroll's 2023 anime of the year Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and Kill La Kill , is a fantasy anime. The show follows a group of adventurers named Laios, Marcille, and Chilchuck as they attempt a second dungeon run. However, unlike their first failed endeavor, the stakes are at an all-time high because the party must reach the bottom level of the dungeon in time to save their spellcaster (Laios' sister) before a fearsome red dragon completely digests her.\nLuckily, it takes a dragon of that genus quite a while to fully digest a meal, thus giving our party of heroes ample time to recruit new allies to slay monsters they encounter into gourmet meals to keep their strength up. Delicious in Dungeon isn't just another fantasy adventure anime, it's a foodie anime with impeccable comedic chops to boot.\nPHOTO SOURCE: Netflix Lately, anime has started to take an earnest step toward exploring the fantasy genre by creating isekai (stories where modern characters are whisked away into a fantasy world). Over the years the genre has become oversaturated with increasingly random and forgettable Mad-Libs-esque premises. However, Delicious in Dungeon wisely recaptures the whimsical nature of fantasy anime while adapting the comedy and drama from isekai's fish-out-of-water approach to storytelling by making a show with a simple-yet-effective premise: What if your Dungeons and Dragons party could only eat whatever they kill on their perilous quest?\nDelicious in Dungeon's premiere episode answers in kind with hilarious kitchen disasters where slime monsters and carnivorous plants nearly devour poor Marcille — who's already an early lock for anime fail girl of the year.\nNetflix's binge-watch model is a touchy subject for anime fans Another thing of note with Delicious In Dungeon that bares importance is how the show is being released on the streaming giant. Unlike Netflix's standard bing-watch release model where an entire season of a show is released all at once, new episodes of Delicious in Dungeon release every Thursday. This is particularly significant for scorned JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fans who were in an uproar over Netflix's poor handling of its latest season, Stone Ocean .\nBack in the day, JoJo's fans had \"JoJo Fridays\" a phenomena popularized during its previous season where fans shared fan art, memes, and engaged in online discussions coinciding with the release of new episodes. Basically, JoJo Fridays, like \"Gundam Sundays\" and \"Chainsaw Man Mondays,\" was water cooler talk for weebs that kept the show's hype alive on a weekly basis.\nUnfortunately, under Netflix's binge-watching model — coupled with a lack of online promotion of the show — had even the most die-hard fans forget new chunks of the show had been released or that the show had ended. Neflix's handling of Stone Ocean even had fans debatinig whether or not the streamer's staggered binge-release model robbed the show of the ferver its weekly release shedule once generated while provoking anxiety among fans over whether or not other exclusive anime would suffer the same fate .\nPHOTO SOURCE: Netflix Thankfully, Netflix appears to be course correcting from its fumbling of Stone Ocean by giving folks ample time to savor in Delicious in Dungeon's comfy seinen cooking vibes with its weeklly release schedule instead of having fans gorge themselves on the show's 24 episodes in one sitting. Seeing as how Delicious in Dungeon's manga ended last September, the only hurdle viewers will have to overcome now is resisting the urge to read ahead before a new episode drops!",

    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n记者从中国科学院物理研究所获悉，该所科研团队近期成功研制出厚度仅为头发丝直径的二十万分之一的单原子层金属，这是国际上首次实现大面积二维金属材料的制备，开创了二维金属研究新领域。这种材料未来可以为超微型低功耗晶体管、透明显示等领域带来技术革新。该科研成果于北京时间3月13日在国际学术期刊《自然》发表。\n在我们日常生活中，人们见到的材料都是三维的，也就是具有一定长度、宽度、高度，但如果把一个维度抹平，那就是二维材料。例如一本书就具有长宽高，而二维材料就像是从这本书上单独撕下来的一页纸，看上去只有长和宽，厚度在我们肉眼看来几乎为零。在科学界，真实的二维材料就是厚度为单个原子或者少数几个原子的材料，一般厚度仅仅是一张A4纸的百万分之一。\n如何把金属材料也能做得这么薄呢？这在科学界极具挑战性。中国科学院物理研究所张广宇研究员带领团队发展了原子级制造的范德华挤压技术。这种技术采用的压砧是原子级平整、表面无悬挂键的材料。科研团队通过将金属熔化并利用团队前期制备的高质量单层二硫化钼范德华压砧挤压，实现了原子极限厚度下铋、锡、铅等二维金属的普适制备。二维金属的实现超越了当前二维范德华层状材料体系，补充了二维材料家族的一大块拼图。\n据了解，通过范德华挤压技术制备的二维金属上下均被单层二硫化钼所封装，具有非常好的环境稳定性。这项研究成果有望开创二维金属研究的新领域，为超微型低功耗晶体管、高频器件、透明显示、超灵敏传感探测、极致高效催化等众多领域带来技术革新。\n（总台央视记者 帅俊全 褚尔嘉）\n（责任编辑：单晓冰）",

    "text": "Here's how some Kansas Citians celebrate their leap day birthdays on Feb. 29\nLeap day babies, also known as leaplings, celebrate their true birthdays once every four years. A panel of leaplings joined Up To Date to discuss how they commemorate their special days.\nBecky Janzen was born in 1952. But this year she’s celebrating her 18th leap birthday with a retro senior prom theme complete with two ‘50s classics: maraschino cherry cake and doo-wop.\nMax Sheffield is the parent of a leap baby born in 2020. While they and their co-parent typically celebrate their son’s birthday on separate days, leap day requires an adjustment.\n“I co-parent my son, so it was kind of up in the air,” Sheffield said. “In our parenting plan, I had to explain to the attorneys, ‘We need special rules on leap years.’”\nAlthough leaplings get plenty of attention on Feb. 29, which only appears on the calendar every four years, so do leaping animals, such as frogs and toads.\nKansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney used the day to spotlight amphibian conservation. Two out of every five amphibian species is threatened with extinction, but the zoo is promoting awareness and helping to revive an endangered species.\nThe\nWyoming Toad population nearly went extinct in the 1990s due to habitat decline and toxic pesticides. Now, the Kansas City Zoo is a part of an effort to breed and reintroduce the species to its native habitat.\n- Dr. Daniel McIntosh, Professor of Physics and Astronomy in the\nUMKC School of Science and Engineering\n- Becky Janzen, leapling\n- Kurt Marquart, leapling\n- Sydney Siemens, leapling\n- Max Sheffield, parent of leapling\n- Rachel Sandoval, registered dietician nutritionist and program manager for\nLifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer’s Prevention\n- Sean Putney, CEO of the Kansas City Zoo\n- Lori Ventura, Owner & Tour Operator of\nKansas City Fountain Tours",

    "text": "Citi Double Cash Card Limited Time Offer\nTable of Contents\nCiti Double Cash Card Limited Time signup bonus\nFor a limited time only you’ll earn $200 cash back in the form of 20,000 ThankYou points for spending $1,500 in 6 months on a new\n Citi Double Cash Card.\nThis card rarely offers any signup bonus, making this a great offer for an incredible card! It’s also the highest signup bonus for this card to date.\nCiti Double Cash Card annual fee\n$0.\nCiti Double Cash Card signup bonus rules\nPoints are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi Double Cash account in the past 48 months.\nCiti allows applications for 1 card every 8 days and 2 cards every 2 months. You can check application status at 866-252-0118 and you can call reconsideration if you’re denied at 800-695-5171.\nCiti Double Cash Card earnings\nThis card earns 2% cash back everywhere, in the form of 2 ThankYou points per dollar spent.\nThat is an excellent earn rate for a flexible currency that lets you have the best of both worlds, cash or points on demand as you want it.\nYou can redeem those points for 2% cash back with no minimum required to cash out, or you can transfer them into miles if you have a\n Citi Premier card.\nCiti also often offers discounted gift cards with ThankYou points, which can offer even more value.\nIf you also have a\nCiti Rewards+ you’ll get also a 10% rebate, up to 10,000 points rebated per year, when you redeem points!\nYou can also earn 5% cash back in the form of 5 ThankYou points per dollar on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on the Citi Travel portal through 12/31/24.\nCiti Double Cash Card zero APR on balance transfers\n- Get 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months from date of the first transfer.\n- Balance transfers need to be completed in the first 4 months of account opening.\n- There is a balance transfer fee of $5 or 3% of the amount of the transfer, whichever is greater.\nCiti Double Cash Card Non-expiring points\nYour Citi ThankYou points will not expire for as long as you remain a cardholder.

You will also get 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months.\nThe\nCiti Rewards+ Card automatically rounds up rewards earned on every purchase to the nearest 10 points, meaning you will earn 10 points on a $0.50 Amazon balance reload, which is equal to earning 20 points per dollar spent! You will also get 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months.\nHaving a\nCiti Rewards+ Card also gets you a 10% points rebate when you redeem points, up to a 10K points rebate per year. While the Rewards+ card doesn’t transfer points into most airline miles, if you have a Citi Premier card and a Rewards+ card you’ll even get a 10% rebate on mileage transfers!\nThe\nCiti Premier Card allows you to transfer all of your ThankYou points into miles with many valuable programs. It earns 3 points per dollar on airfare, hotels, travel agents, groceries, gas, and dining.\nA Citi Bifecta would consist of a household that has the\nCiti Premier and the Citi Double Cash or https://www.dansdeals.com/go/RewardsPlusQS1/.
