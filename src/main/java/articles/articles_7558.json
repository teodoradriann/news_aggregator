    "text": "Paul McCartney Said The Beatles Could Be ‘Very Chauvinist’: ‘Women at That Time Got Sidelined’\nIn the early years of\nThe Beatles, Paul McCartney said the band was incredibly tight-knit. They lived, toured, and wrote music together. While each of them had serious long-term relationships in the early years of the band, McCartney said their band relationships were more important to them. He admitted that this made them chauvinistic.\nPaul McCartney said The Beatles were so tight-knit they could be ‘chauvinist’\nIn 1963, McCartney met Jane Asher, an actor. The couple dated for five years and McCartney lived with her at her parents’ home for a portion of this time. While he said it was a “good relationship,” she was not his primary focus. His bandmates were.\n“To tell the truth, the women at that time got sidelined,” he said in The Beatles Anthology. “Now it would be seen as very chauvinist of us. Then it was like: ‘We are four miners who go down the pit. You don’t need women down the pit, do you? We won’t have women down the pit.’”\nMcCartney admitted that the band dynamic could not have been easy on their romantic partners.\n“A lot of what we, The Beatles, did was very much in an enclosed scene,” he said. “Other people found it difficult — even John’s wife, Cynthia, found it very difficult — to penetrate the screen that we had around us. As a kind of safety barrier we had a lot of ‘in’ jokes, little signs, references to music; we had a common bond in that and it was very difficult for any ‘outsider’ to penetrate. That possibly wasn’t good for relationships back then.”\nJohn Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr relied on each other in The Beatles\nRingo Starr agreed with McCartney’s assessment of The Beatles. He admitted that they grew apart as years passed. Still, he believed that they were\ncloser than most bands.\n“I don’t know of any other band who got that close,” Starr told Club Sandwich in 1997 (via\nThe Paul McCartney Project). “And we got that close because we loved each other and the pressure that only the Beatles had. No other band has had that much pressure. So all of those factors come into play when we meet each other. We know what went on. Nobody else knows. Everybody thinks they know, and they have ideas, and they write books about it, but actually only the Beatles know how heavy that was.”\nJohn Lennon said it was embarrassing to have a wife and child\nTo further prove McCartney’s point, John Lennon said he found it\nembarrassing to be married with a child. He wanted his first wife, Cynthia, to keep their relationship quiet and he saw her very little once the band began touring.\n“I did feel embarrassed, walking around married,” he said, per the book John Lennon: The Life by Philip Norman. “It felt like walking round with odd socks on or your flies open.”\nHe, like McCartney, preferred the company of his bandmates at the time.",

    "text": "Trio arrested for home invasion robbery coordinated through escort service website Three people were arrested after a scheme through an escort service website led to a man being tied up in a Port Charlotte home invasion robbery. According to the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office, the man made arrangements online with a 27-year-old Lee County woman identified as Amber Nicole Brown. The two met on August 2. Approximately 15 minutes after Brown arrived, two men knocked on the victim's front door. The men, later identified as Christopher Clark and Pete Bertolotti, said they lost their dog but then forced their way into the home. The duo had a hammer and crowbar and pushed the homeowner to the ground. Clark and Bertolotti then moved the man to the bedroom where they duct-taped his hands and feet, CCSO said. They commanded the victim to tell them where the money he promised Brown was. According to the report, they also forced him to unlock his phone and transferred the payment to Brown. After leaving the victim tied up, they shut the door and rummaged through his phone before leaving. The man was able to chew through the duct tape around his hands and hop to the kitchen. He was able to cut his feet free with scissors but noticed several sets of keys to his vehicles were missing. A vehicle was also missing from his driveway, along with his cellphone, and he ran to his neighbor's home to call 911. Not long after, a Lee County K9 deputy noticed a vehicle speeding down McGregor Boulevard. They discovered it was the stolen vehicle that belonged to the victim. According to the report, the driver ignored the deputy's attempts to stop them and began cutting through parking lots. The driver then hit a curb, causing a tire to go flat. The suspects then ran away. The Lee County deputy and his K9 were able to track down Brown, Clark and Bertolotti to an apartment complex where they were arrested. Clark and Bertolotti are being held in Lee County Jail on unrelated charges. However, CCSO said they will also face charges for this incident in Charlotte County. Brown is being held in Charlotte County Jail on a $100,000 bond and facing the following charges: - Home invasion robbery with a weapon - False imprisonment of a person against their will - Battery on a person 65 years or older DOWNLOAD the free [NBC2 News app](https://www.flowcode.com/page/nbc2-news-app) for the latest alerts on this story",
