    "text": "Cyclone Chido : Mayotte placé en alerte rouge cyclonique à partir de 22 heures, heure locale, annonce le préfet\n\"Restez confinés et ne sortez sous aucun prétexte\", mettent en garde nos confrères de [Mayotte La 1ère](https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/mayotte/direct-cyclone-chido-suivez-l-evolution-de-la-situation-a-mayotte-en-temps-reel-1544938.html). Alors que le cyclone tropical Chido s'apprête à toucher le département français de l'océan Indien, le préfet de Mayotte a annoncé que l'archipel serait placé en vigilance rouge dès 22 heures, vendredi 13 décembre, soit 20 heures dans l'Hexagone. La veille, ce dernier avait annoncé le placement de Mayotte en vigilance orange.\n\"C'est un événement inédit, d'une extrême violence, les vents pourront dépasser 180 km/h\", a expliqué François-Xavier Bieuville lors d'une conférence de presse. Le préfet a appelé les personnes logées dans des habitations précaires, très nombreuses dans le département le plus pauvre de France, à se confiner dans les centres d'hébergement ouverts par les autorités.\nDans son dernier bulletin concernant la progression du cyclone dans l'océan Indien, Météo-France a annoncé \"une dégradation des conditions météorologiques\" attendue \"à partir de la fin de nuit de vendredi à samedi avec des vents destructeurs voire dévastateurs, des pluies très intenses et des submersions marines possibles. Une amélioration est attendue à partir de samedi en fin de journée\". En début d'après-midi, le cyclone Chido est classé en catégorie 4.\nCommentaires\nConnectez-vous à votre compte franceinfo pour participer à la conversation.",

    "text": "Recommended Stories\nI-T raid on industrialist Ghanshyam Dalmia in Odisha enters 3rd day; Rs 250 cr cash, 3kg gold seized\nIndian Army officer, Major Prabhanjan Padhi (30) from PPL in Paradip received the ‘Sena Medal’ for his exceptional display of bravery and valour.\nAn officer of Rashtriya Rifles, Padhi was awarded the Sena Medal on Army Day (January 15) by President Droupadi Murmu.\nPadhi led a counter-terrorism operation in South Kashmir as a company commander and successfully completed the operation which saw terrorists throwing grenades and mortars apart from indiscriminate firing of bullets.\nHis family expressed happiness over the recognition of their son and felt proud of the exceptional valour of their son.\n“He (Prabhanjan) got an information about Pakistani terrorists hiding in a village in south Kashmir. He led a quick-action team to the spot. Seeing the Army approaching, the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately from their automatic rifles. While the terrorists do not care for civilians, the Army has to carefully conduct the operation so that there are no civilian casualties. He neutralised two terrorists in that operation evacuating the civilians safely,” said his father Basant Padhi.\nThe Sena Medal is awarded to members of the Indian Army, of all ranks \"for such individual acts of exceptional devotion to duty or courage as have special significance for the Army.\" Awards may be made posthumously and a bar is authorized for subsequent awards of the Sena Medal.",

    "text": "Sauna and Cold Plunge Benefits + My Must Have Sauna Accessories\nEvery time I post anything about hot/cold therapy on my IG, you guys wanna know all the info. I feel like saunas and cold plunging are kind of all the rage right now? Guess everyone is really experiencing the health benefits. Michael, Westin and I do too. We’ll go over the benefits of saunas in a minute, but like, the high that I personally get from it is EUPHORIC.\nYears ago, it all started with some cold showers. And before that I was such a fan of ice facials, cryotherapy, and duh, ice rolling. Big ice lover over here.\nBefore we get into all the specifics about the brands, and what I like about my sauna and cold plunge routine, the benefits, (& accessories I love, LOL) here is the exact protocol that I’ve been doing.\nMY HOT/COLD THERAPY PROTOCOL:\n+ 2 mins ice bath\n+ 15 mins sauna\n+ 2.5 mins ice bath\n+ 20 min sauna\n+ 3 mins ice bath\nAnd I do this 3-4 times a week. It’s addicting. The feeling in your body after a cold plunge is insane. There’s no other feeling like it. It improves physical and mental health and is a huge stress reliever! The key is not to overdo it or it’s not as effective. Around 11 minutes per week is all that’s needed.\nDr. Huberman says that you should try to finish on COLD. And like, DUH, you’re gonna to want to end with the sauna, we all do. But if you end with cold it allows your body to heat up naturally which will stimulate your metabolism. And you want to keep that freezing fucking cold, shivering feeling for as long as possible so I wait like 30 minutes to shower. You want to keep that shiver effect so that it gets to your brown fat.\nThe postpartum experience with Townes was so different from Zaza’s, in so many ways, but one of the main things is that I feel like this layer of fat has dissolved from my body – & it’s from hot & cold therapy. I swear.\nSidenote:\nIf you have yet to meet Dr. Huberman, he is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function, and neuroplasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behavior skills and cognitive functioning.\nHe has a phenomenal podcast called Huberman Lab that me and Michael are both regular listeners of. Highly recommended because he does the best job presenting information that’s science-backed, digestible, applicable to literally everyone. He has been on The Skinny Confidential HIM & HER show, part 1 & part 2, and like I took so many notes. Seriously listen with pen & paper.\nOk, so let’s get into the exact types of saunas & ice baths Michael and I have in our home.\nBARREL SAUNA\nIn our backyard we have such a beautiful, classic barrel sauna. It’s so relaxing, but energizing at the same time when used with the ice bath. This one makes you sweat. It’s hot, it gets touch, but the benefits are beyond.\nIf you’re interested in the sauna that we have, use this link or email hilary@theskinnyconfidential.com and she’ll send you some info.\nSUN HOME INFRARED SAUNA\nIn my office, I have a Sun Home infrared sauna. I LOVE IT. For me, I go in this for more of a chill time. It’s not as hot as the barrel, it’s more of like a slow burn. Michael likes to read in it, I go in the morning after I drink too much, or do legs up the wall and meditate. It’s just not as intense as the barrel but you still get insane benfits. You can use this link for $300 off a sauna or cold plunge with Sun Home.\nHOT TIP: it’s the perfect place to get away from your kids.\nAll The Sauna Benefits:\n+ detoxification\n+ heart health\n+ muscle recovery\n+ anti-aging\n+ relaxation\n+ immunity\n+ sleep\n+ weight loss\n+ lowers blood pressure\n+ increasing blood flow\nIf you decide to go with one of these, be sure to use the code SKINNY on this pricing form, and mention it to your sales rep.\nAlso, if you’re wanting to try an infrared sauna sessions but don’t want to spend all that money installing one in your home or don’t have one at a spa near you, give Higher Dose a try. It enhances relaxation, promotes glowing skin and is perfect for people who don’t have space for a full blown sauna. And you can use code SKINNY15 for 15% off your purchase.\nTHE COLD PLUNGE\nLOVE the cold plunge. It’s so chic & looks good in any home, no matter your style. It’s not an ugly eyesore, ya know? Actually, the founder was on the blog not too long ago and you can check out his interview here. We have ours outside, but this is perfect if you want an ice bath inside your house.\nIf you’re going to purchase from The Cold Plunge use code SKINNY150 for $150 off.\nBLUE CUBE ICE BATH\nThis is the one that we use outside. The weather has been incredible in Austin lately, so we tend to use this one the most. Also, our barrel sauna is really close to it which makes the whole contrast therapy seamless. You can get all different sizes of ice bath from Blue Cube and I highly recommend it. Plus, you can use code SKINNY for $500 off.\nIt’s so nice & grounding and beautifully designed. It kinda like, just blends in with nature. It fits so well with our backyard environment, and Joe Rogan has this one. Fun fact, they were just custom building his when they dropped of mine.\nThe reason we have two, Blue Cube and The Cold Plunge, is because we love to try out all things wellness. Both are great choices and you can’t go wrong with either.\nICE BARREL\nThe Ice Barrel is a really good option if you’re low on space. It’s fairly lightweight and you could put it anywhere. Just to be clear, we do not own this one, but I really like it as an option for people who are maybe renting/planning to move soon, or who are just getting into hot/cold therapy. Again, you can use code SKINNY for $125 off. Arctic Fox is a new portable way to cold plunge that I highly recommend too.\nAll The Ice Bath Health Benefits:\n+ Speeds up muscle & injury recovery\n+ Reduces inflammation\n+ improves fat burning\n+ improves skin conditions\n+ builds mental toughness\n+ Supports a healthy immune system\n+ Enhances immune function\n+ Improves lymphatic circulation\n+ Increases red blood cell count & growth hormone levels\n+ Improves levels of endurance & recovery\n+ Increases cardiovascular health\n+ Increases white blood cells which stimulates the immune system\n+ Improves sleep & reducing stress\n+ Improves circulation\n+ Constricting blood vessels promotes better circulation\nAnd now for the best part. Let’s get into the fashion of it all. LOL. No but really, these are all my must haves:\nMUST HAVE SAUNA ACCESSORIES:\nDuh, to keep it steamy.\nThey regulate the temperature of your head, ears, and even prevent damage to your hair. In a nutshell, your head heats up the fastest and the hats keep your head relatively ‘cool.’ You soak the hat in water first and wear it wet, and as the water evaporates in the sauna, it keeps you cool (ish). Apparently it’s thought to reduce hair loss too.\nI like to fill mine with Beauty Water. It’ll replenish your electrolytes and give you other health and beauty benefits with colostrum and pearl powder too. Learn more [here](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/beauty-water-an-efficient-solution-to-your-morning-supplements/).\nBecause you still want to be comfortable while getting uncomfortable.\n[Brooke from The Road](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-is-facial-acupuncture/) told me to be careful with my face overheating and that ice rolling while in the sauna will help with hyperpigmentation.\nWe love sipping these in the sauna. Use code SKINNY for 25% off and listen to the founder on the podcast [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000551748559).\nMUST HAVE COLD PLUNGE ACCESSORIES:\nAlways be protecting your skin from the sun, even in a freezing cold bath.\nLove these pool towels, highly recommend.\n+ [bamboo bathmat](https://amzn.to/3QRCZi0) (more [here](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-wooden-bathmat-of-your-dreams-say-goodbye-to-crusty-rugs/))\nVery grounding & just ties everything together, don’t you think?\nThere you have it. Truly loving all hot/cold therapy things. I love the intenseness of it all and I’ve always been like that with all things. I like super hot, ice fucking cold, insane spice, rough dry brushing – you get it. If you have extra space in your home, you might as well look into getting an indoor sauna.\nOverall, doing alternating between hot and cold temperatures, contrast therapy, made me feel more clarity, more energized and more relaxed, it’s enhanced my quality of sleep & mood and I feel like it’s been really good for my skin like it aids in muscle recovery. Noticed a huge difference in my hormones postpartum too. I felt more even-keeled.\nIf you’re just getting started the move is to ease into it. It’s like you need to have this perfect balance of being uncomfortable but safe. Start slow, with short intervals and work your way up. If you ever feel dizzy or lightheaded in the sauna, get out, stay hydrated and decrease your time.\nYou can literally learn everything else you want to now in Dr. Huberman’s podcast episodes ([part 1](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000559313117) & [part 2](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000559682914)) and you can [check out this post](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/dr-andrew-hubermans-ice-bath-tips-tricks/) where we broke down his ice bath tips & tricks & how to utilize ice baths.\nLet me know what benefits you’ve seen from hot and [cold therapy](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/ice-bath-benefits-you-need-to-know-about/) below. So curious. And if you’re new to all this, just start with a 3 minute ice cold shower & the [ice roller](https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/hot-mess-ice-roller). You’ll be addicted in no time.\nx, Lauryn\n+ [BEAUTY WATER](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/beauty-water-an-efficient-solution-to-your-morning-supplements/): How I start every single day.\n++ My [immune-support toolkit](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-immune-system-toolkit/).",

    "text": "SANTA FE\nMichael Welch moved out of Texas City to Santa Fe a little over a dozen years ago to escape urban sprawl, but now he’s worried urban sprawl is coming to him.\nThe sprawl Welch is talking about is a planned 1,000-acre development that, at build out, could double Santa Fe’s population, which U.S. Census estimates put at 12,980 in 2023.\nThe city council in December 2023 approved a development agreement with Tres Rios Laguna Azure LCC for a project that envisions more than 2,800 single-family home lots and 1,200 multifamily units for the tract south of Dickinson Bayou. The development, which also includes plans for commercial buildings for hospitality, entertainment and recreation businesses constructed around a 2-acre manmade lake, could double Santa Fe’s population, which U.S. Census estimates put at 12,980 in 2023.\nWelch is among residents raising concern about a developer’s plan to discharge treated wastewater into a canal system that supplies drinking water. However, such processes are being employed nationwide as population growth and climate change put pressure on the domestic water supply.\nA permit application from Dallas-based Megatel Homes for the Tres Rios Laguna development seeks authorization to “discharge of treated wastewater at a volume not to exceed an annual average flow of 1,330,000 gallons per day.”\nThe proposed water treatment plant would be built right across from Welch’s house on Cowan Road, according to a notification letter he received about the permit application, he said.\nHe’s worried too many people improperly toss everything from prescription drugs to cleaning supplies down their toilets and those chemicals could make their way into locals’ drinking water.\nThe treated wastewater would be discharged into water that’s use is “high aquatic life use for Gulf Coast Water Authority Canal G,” according to the application.\nWelch is worried about big storms such as Tropical Storm Claudette and Hurricane Harvey deluging the area and swamping the planned wastewater treatment plant.\nTropical Storm Claudette dumped 42 inches of rain, a U.S. record, in a 24-hour time frame in July 1979, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hurricane Harvey, in 2017, brought more than a year’s worth of rain near Clear Creek and flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.\nA review of the permit application has “preliminarily determined that existing water quality uses will not be impaired by this permit action,” according to the revised application filed with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\nThe Texas Department of Commerce’s Water Reclamation Snapshot from 2022 notes that clean water is a prerequisite for economic growth but because it is a finite resource, some Texas cities “are turning to reusable sources such as highly cleaned effluent and recaptured wastewater.”\nReclaimed water is discharged to an environmental buffer watercourse such as a lake, river or aquifer to be used again, according to the Water Reclamation Snapshot.\nThe Texas Water Development Board notes on its website that Texas was home to the nation’s first direct potable reuse facility, the Raw Water Production Facility in Big Spring, which opened 2013. Two more direct potable reuse projects are in the works in El Paso and Liberty Hill, according to the website.\n“The regional water planning groups in Texas estimated that existing supply from water reuse is projected to produce about 714,000 acre-feet of water per year by 2070, constituting a 15 percent increase,” according to the Water Development Board website. “The increase in reuse existing supply is primarily due to an increase in wastewater flows associated with an increasing population and the capacity of existing reuse facilities.”\nPublic comment on the Tres Rios permit application is being accepted on the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality website by searching TCEQ Permit No.: WQ0016390001. A public hearing will be held at a to-be-announced date.",

    "title": "Sluggball, baseball's version of Topgolf, is a game for those with a passion for hitting",
    "text": "Sluggball, baseball's version of Topgolf, is a game for those with a passion for hitting\nKenny Lofton, who has watched plenty of his peers get inducted into the Hall of Fame since his 2007 retirement, believes he simply came along at the wrong time or he’d be appreciated, sitting right alongside them in Cooperstown.\nLofton, a six-time All-Star, four-time Gold Glove center fielder who hit .299 with 2,428 hits and 622 stolen bases in his 18-year career, had just one flaw in his game.\nHe didn’t hit home runs, producing just 130 homers while playing all but four years of his career during the steroid era.\n“I was one of those guys that got overlooked because I played in the era of home runs and steroid guys,’’ Lofton told USA TODAY Sports. “That was a big part of the game, but it was like my part of the game meant nothing. I did my job hitting atop of the order. I was getting on base, just trying to help my team.\n“Now, everything is about launch and home runs. Now, its about launch angles and home runs. In my era, I was doing my job.\n“It’s sad to see how the game has turned out.’’\nThis is one of the reasons why Lofton joined forces with former Philadelphia Phillies GM Ruben Amaro and his brother, David Amaro, who co-founded Sluggball. It’s a baseball version of Topgolf, utilizing a four-by-four situational hitting format that will be officially launched May 10 in Trenton, New Jersey, at the Trenton Thunder Ballpark in the first of at least six events.\nThe concept will be for teams of six players to join tournaments to determine the best situational hitters, having players utilize their skills from pulling the ball to hitting to the opposite field to spraying the ball around the infield.\nSluggball is hoping to attract former players, particularly from high school and college, who want to keep playing baseball in a competitive style, but only by swinging the bat, just like popular Topgolf on the driving range.\n“In this day and age,’’ Amaro said, “there are so many alternative sports like pickleball, 3-on-3 basketball, Topgolf and things like that. There’s no such thing in baseball. There’s really no other thing for former high school players and college players who truly love the most fun thing in baseball, and that’s hitting. We just felt like there was a demographic that was being ignored. We think there’s three-million plus people in this sort of 24-to-35-year age demographic who played high school baseball.\n“So many people don’t have anything else to do, so they’re going to play softball, which is not the same thing.’’\nWho knows, perhaps the advent of Sluggball will bring popularity back to small-ball, with Ichiro Suzuki representing the value of being able to control his bat with his Hall of Fame election on Tuesday.\nLofton, 57, can only hope.\n“Can you imagine if Dave Kingman were playing now, he’d be all-world,’’ Lofton said. “Adam Dunn would have been a $50 million a year player. It’s just such a different game now. Situational hitting in the game is terrible. People get excited more about home runs and strikeouts.\n“So once this was introduced to me, and the concept of it all, it interested me. I’m hoping this will get people excited about situational hitting and talked about more in today’s game. It’s not all about home runs. It’s about knowing how to hit.\n“Hopefully, this Sluggball gets into people’s heads and let them know what’s important. It’s part of the game that’s exciting, but has gone away. Now, just like with Ichiro, hopefully this can wake people up.’’\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale",

    "title": "Xi Jinping afirma, en discurso de Año Nuevo, que China estará \"seguramente reunificada\"",
    "text": "China \"seguramente se reunificará\", declaró este domingo el presidente Xi Jinping durante su discurso de Año Nuevo , informaron medios estatales. \"Todos los chinos de ambas costas del estrecho de Taiwán deberían estar unidos por un objetivo común y compartir la gloria del rejuvenecimiento de la nación china\", dijo Xi, según la reseña del discurso difundido por la cadena oficial CCTV.\nDurante una reunión a mediados de noviembre con el presidente estadounidense Joe Biden, Xi Jinping ya juzgó \"inevitable\" la reunificación de Taiwán.\nChina considera a Taiwán como una provincia que todavía no ha conseguido unir al resto de su territorio desde que terminó la guerra civil, en 1949.\nLee también Tras llamar \"dictador\" a Xi Jinping, China debe esperar franqueza de Biden, dice Blinken\nBeijing , que no ha renunciado a conquistar la isla por la fuerza, ejerce una fuerte presión militar y económica sobre Taiwán desde 2016, cuando llegó al poder Tsai Ing-wen, del Partido Democrático Progresista (PDP) que, según Pekín, se empeña en defender la independencia.\nPara Taipéi, Beijing aumentó la presión militar en los últimos meses en torno a la isla, antes de las elecciones presidenciales de enero.\nPor otro lado, en el plano económico, Xi consideró que la economía china es \"más resistente y más dinámica\" de lo que era.\nLastrada por una gestión muy cara de la crisis del Covid-19, la segunda economía mundial apenas logró repuntar en 2023.\nIncluso así, según Xi Jinping , la economía del gigante asiático logró dominar la tormenta en el año que está por concluir.\nSin embargo, la tasa de paro entre los jóvenes, que bate récords, la falta de confianza de los consumidores y una crisis de la deuda persistente en el sector inmobiliario, clave, también socavaron el crecimiento.\nLa actividad manufacturera continuó contrayéndose en diciembre, según datos oficiales publicados el domingo.\nY, pese a algunas señales alentadoras, como el crecimiento del 4,9% del PIB en el tercer trimestre (mejor de lo previsto), Beijing podría tenerlo complicado para lograr su objetivo de crecimiento anual de en torno al 5%, el más modesto en años.\nLee también FOTOS: \"Taxi volador\" completa con éxito su demostración de vuelo comercial en China\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.",

(WAFF) - Wednesday was a beautiful day across the Tennessee Valley, and the Huntsville Green Team is encouraging people to get out and enjoy it.\nBikers, hikers, and explorers from across the valley took to the Hayes Nature Preserve for a special outdoor event.\nThe Green team gathered up local businesses and brought them out for a free outdoor event to encourage the community to come out and enjoy our local nature.\nA Scavenger hunt was even held to keep the little ones active outside.\nOrganizers said while it was a fun event, it can also help keep you healthy.\n“We always want to encourage people to be outdoors,” said Nikole Sothers, the Huntsville Green Team Manager. “We think that having a connection to the environment also has a connection to keeping our city clean.”\nSothers went on to say it can also help improve mental and physical health as people get out and be social while enjoying their hobbies.\nClick Here to Subscribe on YouTube: Watch the latest WAFF 48 news, sports & weather videos on our YouTube channel!\nCopyright 2025 WAFF.
