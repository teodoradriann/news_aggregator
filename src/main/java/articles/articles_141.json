Lionel Ventura, auteur du livre \"Ma trousse de secours\" chez Flammarion, propose un guide pratique pour apprendre à réagir efficacement face à des situations de détresse vitale. Grâce à une combinaison de techniques d'acupression et de gestes de premiers secours, il offre une approche pour aider à régir rapidement en cas d'urgence. Cette méthode ancienne mais toujours efficace, l'acupression, peut soulager divers maux courants comme : le nez bouché, la sinusite ou encore les douleurs abdominales. En France, la sensibilisation aux gestes de premiers secours, avec l’Attestation de Premiers Secours (APS), reste insuffisante. Lionel Ventura souligne la nécessité d'une mise à jour annuelle des compétences pour toutes et tous dès l'école primaire.

    "title": "I built a successful business and I hate it. What should I do? - Indie Hackers",
    "text": "I’m a few years into running a business I built from the ground up, but here’s the kicker—I hate it. When I started this journey, I was all in. I left a stable corporate job to pursue what I thought was my passion, poured everything I had into making this business successful, and for a while, it worked. I was proud of what I created, and it felt like I was doing something meaningful. But now, every day feels like a grind, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m trapped in a cage of my own making. It’s not just the long hours or the stress of running a business—though those are definitely part of it. It’s the fact that I’ve lost all connection to why I started this in the first place. The industry has changed, and so have I. The things that used to excite me now feel like chores, and the thought of continuing down this path for another year, let alone another decade, makes me want to scream. My family and friends see me as this successful entrepreneur, living the dream, and they don’t understand why I’m so unhappy. My employees rely on me, and I feel a huge sense of responsibility toward them. The business is profitable, and I’m making more money than I ever did in my old job, but what’s the point if I’m miserable every single day? I’ve thought about selling the business, but the idea of walking away feels like admitting defeat. What if I never find something I’m passionate about again? What if I regret giving up everything I’ve built? On the flip side, the thought of sticking it out and pretending to care for the sake of everyone else feels like I’m signing up for a slow death by boredom and burnout. So, what should I do? Should I sell the business, shut it down, or suck it up and keep going? Am I just going through a rough patch, or is it time to admit that I’ve fallen out of love with my own creation? —Shaun B. Let me start by saying this: You’re not alone. There’s a dirty little secret that successful entrepreneurs rarely admit out loud—it’s entirely possible to hate the business you built. You’ve likely heard that if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. But what happens when what you love becomes a golden cage, locking you in with your own success? I've been in your shoes. I built an agency from the ground up, and after several detours, I found myself running a business I no longer enjoyed. Like you said, it was successful—I was building for the market, solving a need, and getting rewarded for it. But solving for the market and what customers want isn’t always what you want. I spent years grinding it out, only to watch things worsen over time. If you keep trying to \"suck it up and push through,\" as you mentioned, you'll eventually run the business into the ground. Burnout will set in, and even the simplest tasks will start to feel like massive chores. You'll procrastinate and avoid doing what you know is essential to keep the business moving forward. And when that happens, decline is inevitable. A business is either growing or dying—there's no in-between. It might be a slow death, but it will happen if you keep pushing forward at this rate. That's exactly how I ran my business into the ground. I couldn't force myself to keep doing the work it required because, like you, the thought of continuing down that path for another year—let alone a decade—made me want to scream. The hard truth You owe nothing to the business you built. It doesn’t care about you; it’s an entity, a machine that runs on your time, energy, and passion. If that fuel is running low, it’s time to reassess. If a job were making you miserable, you'd quit, right? Yet, when it comes to our business, we trick ourselves into thinking we need to stay out of some misplaced sense of duty. But the reality is that staying in a business you hate is no different than staying in a toxic relationship. Sell it, hand it off, or burn it down Here’s the controversial part. It might be time to burn it all down. Sell the business, hand it off to someone who still has the passion, or even shut it down if that’s what it takes to reclaim your life. Or, pivot the business into something that excites you—something that energizes you and aligns with your values, contributing to a cause you find meaningful. That's exactly what I did. After sabotaging my own business and being stuck with the pieces, I decided to pivot. I began rebuilding slowly, offering different services and running things in a fun and exciting way again. The world won't end if you walk away. It might be the best decision you'll ever make. Imagine waking up tomorrow with a clean slate—a chance to start something new, something that excites you. That's not failure; that's evolution. Your business is supposed to serve your life, not the other way around. If it’s not serving you, it’s time to move on. You know how to build a successful business—you’ve proven it. Now, take those skills and start again. Create something new that excites you, something you’ll look forward to in the next chapter of your career. How to move forward Now, I’m not saying go full scorched earth without a plan. Get your finances in order, talk to a business broker, and if you have employees, give them a soft landing. But don’t let guilt or societal expectations trap you in a life you’ve outgrown. Once you have an exit strategy, focus on what you want to do next. Not sure where to start or what to do next? That's okay. Start by exploring and figuring out what really lights you up. Think about what you love spending time on in this new season of your life. Give yourself the space to dream a little. Ask yourself the big questions: What would your perfect workday look like now? What changes can you make to get closer to making that a reality? Which personal strengths would you like to use daily to run your business? Is there an intersection between what you love and what the world needs? If you were just given one million dollars to start your next business, what would that business be? What would your business offer to the world? What kind of people would your business serve? What kind of people would you hire? Start there and see where your answers lead. Moving forward is about reclaiming your passion and aligning your work with what truly matters to you. It’s not about having all the answers right away—it's about giving yourself permission to explore, dream, and redefine what success looks like for you. Start small, ask the big questions, and let those answers guide you toward your next chapter. Already have an account? [Sign in](/sign-in).",

    "text": "Craque português marcou um gol fundamental em sua carreira e alcançou um feito inédito no futebol. Um dos maiores jogadores da história do futebol quebrou mais um recorde nesta quinta-feira (5). Cristiano Ronaldo marcou o segundo gol de Portugal na partida contra a Croácia, válida pela abertura da Liga das Nações, e alcançou um feito marcante. O craque português se tornou o único atleta a chegar na marca de 900 gols oficiais na carreira. Na contagem da FIFA,o ranking ainda tem Lionel Messi com 838 gols, Josef Bican anotando 805 gols, Romário alcançado 772 gols e Pelé fechando a lista de líderes com 767 gols marcados. Nesta lista, amistosos entre clubes e seleções e outros jogos não são contabilizados. CR7 disputou 1238 jogos até marcar 900 gols. Dentro deste incrível número, o gajo fez 575 gols com o pé direito, 172 com o pé esquerdo, 151 tentos de cabeça e outros 2 gols com outras partes do corpo. Separando os gols pelo espaço do campo em que foram marcados, Cristiano Ronaldo impressiona ainda mais. 604 dentro da área, 164 em cobranças de pênalti, 68 gols de fora da área e 64 tentos marcados em cobranças de falta. Olhando para os clubes, Ronaldo marcou 5 gols pelo Sporting, 145 gols pelo Manchester United, 450 tentos pelo Real Madrid, 101 pela Juventus e ainda 68 gols pelo Al Nassr. Por Portugal, Cristiano tem 131 gols marcados.",

    "title": "WNBA star Angel Reese makes cover of Sports Illustrated and Reese’s Puffs boxes nationwide",
    "text": "WNBA All-Star and Randallstown native Angel Reese is making headlines in magazines and on cereal boxes.\nReese landed on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s Power List, which highlights the 50 most influential figures in all of sports. The second annual list published Wednesday spotlights athletes, icons and leaders, executives and influencers. The athletes category features a few from the WNBA, including Reese, fellow rookie Caitlin Clark and league Most Valuable Player A’ja Wilson.\nThe WNBA’s golden age is just beginning. @Reese10Angel graces the cover of SI’s Power List issue, highlighting the 50 most influential figures in sports 🤩\n📷: Taylor Ballantyne https://t.co/nYM68qzar3 pic.twitter.com/D5XIghMs0g\n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) September 18, 2024\nThe Chicago Sky rookie is also gearing up for a collaboration with Reese’s Puffs as the new face of limited-edition “Angel X Reese’s Puffs” cereal boxes, available by the end of October. The partnership includes four back-of-box designs, followed by an “exciting collaboration later this year that continues to blend her creativity and passions for basketball and fashion,” General Mills said in a news release.\n“I’m so excited to partner with such an iconic brand. Not only does this fulfill my childhood dream of being on a cereal box, but there couldn’t be a better fit for me to join forces with than REESE’S PUFFS cereal,” Reese said in a news release. “This collaboration is such an honor, and I can’t wait for fans to get their hands on the cereal box and see what’s next in this partnership.”\nReese, 22, reportedly has endorsement deals worth several million, making more in endorsements than most WNBA players, according to Sarah Zipp, director of sports management at Mount St. Mary’s University.\nReese, along with other members of the WNBA’s rookie class, has helped bring the WNBA to new heights while landing bigger endorsement deals.\n“We are seeing a trend of bigger endorsement deals for WNBA players and increased viewership for WNBA games,” Zipp said. “Those go hand in hand because greater visibility for players makes them more marketable for brands.”\nSeveral factors contribute to the growth of the increased deals for WNBA players. Mainly, players like Reese and Clark were able to build their brand strategies before going professional because of the NCAA allowing name, image and likeness deals in college.\nReese was one of the biggest stars during her college years at LSU and she benefitted from NIL deals to the tune of nearly $2 million, Zipp said. Her success continued into the WNBA.\nClark is perhaps the most popular player in the WNBA, building on her record-shattering college career, according to Zipp. She has a $28 million deal with Nike and has contracts with other major brands like Gatorade, Wilson and State Farm, Zipp said.\n“Of course, they are both extraordinarily successful athletes, and their personas have further increased their fame and marketability,” Zipp said. “Many of these deals are rooted in her NIL days from college and she is breaking new ground for endorsements in the WNBA.”\nThere has been a feedback loop between sponsorship, viewership and media coverage, Zipp said. The longstanding argument has been that there isn’t a big fan base for women’s basketball, but according to Zipp, a lack of media coverage, funding and resources has been holding the sport back.\n“If you can increase viewership, you can increase sponsorship funding. But if there is little media coverage, it’s difficult to build up viewership,” Zipp said. “NIL deals helped break that loop open so that players could go around media gatekeepers to build their fan base via social media and other marketing outlets. The popularity of players like Reese and Clark on the court and in the sport marketplace shows that there is a strong and loyal fan base.”\nBased on this trend in women’s basketball and other examples such as Simone Biles, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Katie Ledecky, opportunities might continue to grow for women in sports in the U.S. and around the globe, Zipp said.",

    "text": "La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) explica que las fechas en las que caen este año los días festivos son muy inestables y que las probabilidades de que caigan precipitaciones son elevadas, sobre todo en determinadas zonas.\nArchivado en:\n[Semana Santa](/etiqueta/semana-santa/.), [tiempo](/etiqueta/tiempo/.), [turismo](/etiqueta/turismo/.), [meteorología](/etiqueta/meteorologia/.)\nLa última semana de marzo es habitualmente inestable\nGENTE\n22/3/2024 - 00:41\nHay pocas fechas en las que los españoles miren más el pronóstico meteorológico que antes de la Semana Santa, uno de los periodos más impredecibles de todo el año. Esa cuestión se agrava este año al caer las jornadas festivas en el mes de marzo y no en abril, sobre todo en lo que tiene que ver con el fenómeno más temido por los que tienen unos días libres: la lluvia. Así lo asegura al menos la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, que apunta a que entre el 24 de marzo y el 1 de abril existe históricamente una gran \"gran variabilidad climática\", aunque eso no debe tomarse como una predicción para los próximos días.\nLa Aemet apunta a que en esta última semana de marzo las precipitaciones son \"frecuentes\". En la Península, las provincias de Almería y Murcia suelen registrar entre 1 y 2 días de precipitación. Le siguen el sur de Badajoz, Andalucía, interior de Murcia, Comunidad Valenciana, Albacete y zonas de Cataluña y Aragón con entre 2 y 3 días. Gran parte del interior peninsular, como la Comunidad de Madrid, y Cataluña tienen entre 3 y 4 días de lluvia, mientras que norte de Castilla y León, La Rioja, Navarra y sur de Cantabria se llevan entre 4 y 5. La zona con más precipitaciones es la de Galicia, Asturias, norte de Cantabria y País Vasco, con entre 5 y 6 días de precipitaciones. En Baleares hay valores entre 2 y 4 días y en Canarias entre 1 y 2.\nUn ejemplo de la variabilidad climática de estas fechas se refleja en la precipitación acumulada en el Observatorio de Retiro en estos días. En ocho de los últimos 43 años no ha habido lluvia y en cuatro más ha sido igual o inferior a 1 l/m2; mientras que en 16 se han superado los 10, siendo los de mayor precipitación 2004 con 49,6, 2003 con 39,3 y 2020 con 28,9.\nBAJAS PRESIONES\nLos que sí se han atrevido a lanzar una primera predicción para la Semana Santa han sido los responsables de la página web eltiempo.es. Uno de sus expertos, Samuel Biener, apunta que los \"días grandes\" estarán marcados por \"una situación de bajas presiones rondando la Península\" que producirá \"un ambiente variable e inestable\".\nAunque los \"centros van a estar bastante móviles por las ondulaciones del Chorro Polar\", Biener señala que el escenario más probable por el momento es que las precipitaciones se concentren sobre todo en la vertiente cantábrica. El portal ha avanzado que las temperaturas en Semana Santa serán más altas de lo habitual, sobre todo en la mitad este peninsular, sudeste, gran parte de Andalucía y ambos archipiélagos.\n----------\n|\n|\nEl invierno más cálido en Madrid:\nLa Comunidad de Madrid ha sufrido el invierno más cálido desde que en 1961 empezaron a registrarse las temperaturas. Así lo aseguró el delegado de la Aemet en Madrid, Miguel Ángel Pelacho, que indicó que la media en este periodo ha sido de 7,4 grados, una anomalía de 1,9 grados superior a la serie histórica.\n-----",
