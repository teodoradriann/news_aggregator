    "text": "Santo Domingo.- The bishop of the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, Monsignor José Amable Duran Tineo, expressed hope and prayer that the upcoming tax reform will benefit the poorest citizens.\n“The necessary fiscal reform should not favor those who already have the most, the influential and powerful groups, but rather the poorest,” said the religious leader to hundreds of parishioners during the Corpus Christi Day Eucharistic mass held at the Faro a Colón.\nDuran Tineo emphasized that he hopes the reform will lead to a fairer distribution of wealth, including significant improvements in salaries, the social security system, and healthcare.\nHe stated, “Although social assistance is necessary, we do not aspire to perpetuate a state of dependency. We advocate for a homeland where social justice prevails, as it is the only guarantee of peace and well-being for all.”\nThe bishop highlighted the disparity in the thriving economy, noting that only 10% of the population benefits from the prosperity. “This results in the luxurious lifestyles of a few and the poverty of the majority, leaving many families in misery,” he said.\nTo address this imbalance, Duran Tineo suggested heeding Pope Francis’ advice to foster a world of fraternal charity, moving away from a society driven by self-interest and utilitarian partnerships.",

    "text": "<p>Bengaluru: Naushad Khan’s cookie-cutter approach to coaching has resulted in his two sons batting in identical, if not aesthetically ideal, fashion. </p>.<p>Both Sarfaraz Khan and Musheer Khan are ungainly, and not meant for those in the business of cricket technique, but their effectiveness cannot be denied. Moreover, they don’t mind looking bad to come good.</p>.<p>On Thursday, though, a lethargic Sarfaraz got run out. Musheer, however, remained loyal to his peculiar technique and earned brownie points for his efficacy.</p>.<p>On the opening day of India A’s four-day Duleep Trophy game against India B, Musheer put on a not-so-handsome 105 not out from 227 balls to guide Abhimanyu Easwaran’s men to 202 for 7 in 79 overs.</p>.<p>At this stage, it’s important to note that this pitch is one of the liveliest ones the M Chinnaswamy stadium has produced in a while. This naturally meant the likes of Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Khaleel Ahmed and even Shivam Dube would have enough to exploit, and they did.</p>.Duleep Trophy: Who will shine in squads filled with stars?.<p>The top three pacers - Khaleel, Akash and Avesh - shared six wickets between them, and justified India A skipper Shubman Gill’s decision to bat first by reducing India B to 89 for 6.</p>.<p>Save for Musheer, who came in at No.3, few top-order batters had resistance to offer. So, India B needed the team’s youngest member at 19-years-old to bail them out. Musheer has done this for a while for Mumbai so his ability to save face for his side was never in doubt, but what strategy would he adopt this time?</p>.<p>The ball was moving off the seam, in the air, and the bowling quality was impressive.</p>.<p>Musheer, for thirteen overs, saw his side's openers Yashavi Jaiswal (30) and Easwaran struggle to find bat on ball. Of course, they had to leave a fair bit since the bowlers kept to the chase-me-if-you-dare channel, but when they did bowl it closer to the body, both were in all sorts of discomfort.</p>.<p>Once the opening pair was split, Musheer started dancing down the track to mitigate the effects of swing. He did it with such frequency that Dhruv Jurel, the wicketkeeper, started standing up to the stumps when Dube was bowling.</p>.<p>Naturally, Jurel couldn’t do that to the other, significantly quicker pacers, so Musheer walked down every chance he got.</p>.<p>In the process, as the pacemen started dragging this length to counter this walk, he picked the right deliveries to stay in his crease and punch runs off the backfoot.</p>.<p>When spin was introduced for the first time, in the 39th over, Musheer dealt Kuldeep Yadav with ease and gave Tanush Kotian the stick each time the off-spinner looped the ball.</p>.<p>Gill was running out of options because he wanted to save his pacers. As these tactical issues reared for the opposition skipper, Musheer grew in confidence and strength. In his presence, Navdeep Saini (29 n.o.) too understood his role and batted with a nice mix of defence and aggression to contribute to the 108-run eighth-wicket alliance.</p>.<p>If only Rishabh Pant had done the same. Alas.</p>.<p>SCOREBOARD </p><p><strong>INDIA B:</strong> Yashasvi Jaiswal c (sub) b Khaleel 30 (59b 6x4) Abhimanyu Easwaran c Jurel b Avesh 13 (42b 1x4) Musheer Khan (batting) 105 (227b 10x4 2x6) Sarfaraz Khan lbw Avesh 9 (35b 1x4) Rishabh Pant c Gill b Akash 7 (10b 1x4) Nitish Kumar Reddy b Akash 0 (1) Washington Sundar (run out) ) 0 (13b) Sai Kishore c Rahul b Khaleel 1 (15b) Navdeep Saini (batting) 29 (74b 4x4 1x6).

    "title": "Ucraina, bombe Usa per attacco a Kursk. Putin: regione libera entro 1 ottobre",
    "text": "(Adnkronos) – L'Ucraina prosegue l'attacco nella regione russa di Kursk e usa bombe americane. Intanto, Vladimir Putin delinea la road map per riconquistare il territorio invaso da Kiev e fissa anche una scadenza. L'offensiva delle forze armate ucraine rimane sotto i riflettori nella guerra iniziata da oltre 900 giorni. L'operazione ha l'obiettivo di mettere fine alla guerra \"alle condizioni di un'Ucraina indipendente\", dice il presidente ucraino, Volodymyr Zelensky, sottolineando che per mettere fine alla guerra è necessario creare quanti più problemi possibili allo Stato russo sul suo territorio. \"Tutti dobbiamo capire che per espellere l'occupante dalla nostra terra, dobbiamo creare quanti più problemi possibili allo Stato russo sul suo territorio. Questo è il lavoro eroico dei nostri soldati. E questo lavoro eroico più è accurato, più è a lungo raggio e più è efficace\", aggiunge. L'aeronautica militare ucraina riferisce intanto di aver usato bombe americane ad alta precisione, del modello GBU-39, per colpire obiettivi militari russi nella regione di Kursk. \"Gli Stati Uniti potrebbero fermare le azioni dell'Ucraina schioccando le dita\", dice nelle stesse ore Anatoly Antonov, ambiasciatore russo a Washington. Prende la parola anche Putin, che denuncia il tentativo ucraino di \"colpire una centrale nucleare. L'Agenzia internazionale per l'energia atomica ne è stata informata e ha promesso di inviare degli specialisti per valutare la situazione. Spero che alla fine questo verrà fatto da parte loro\", dice il presidente russo, citato dall'agenzia Tass. La condotta di Putin è sotto i riflettori dall'inizio dell'offensiva ucraina. Gli analisti dell'Institute for the study of war (Isw), think tank americano che monitora il conflitto, fa riferimento ad una campagna di comunicazione avviata dal Cremlino: l'obiettivo sarebbe quello di rendere 'accettabile' per l'opinione pubblica la limitata presenza di soldati ucraini nel territorio russo. Si tratterebbe, come hanno confermato fonti governative russe all'outlet indipendente Meduza, di una sorta di 'imprevisto' che non deve oscurare la priorità: la campagna russa nel Donetsk, caratterizzata da progressi delle forze di Mosca negli ultimi giorni e destinata a concludersi con la sconfitta 'inevitabile' di Kiev. Putin non ha intenzione di formalizzare l'emergenza nella regione di Kursk e per questo le elezioni per il nuovo governatore, in programma a settembre, rimangono in calendario. Le informazioni raccolte da Meduza delineano un quadro attendista dalle parti di Mosca: tutte le fonti russe interpellate si aspettano che le ostilità nel Kursk durino mesi, con l'elevata probabilità che il Cremlino continui a privilegiare le operazioni nel Donetsk e non disponga la redistribuzione di truppe sul proprio territorio. Diverso il panorama tratteggiato dalla testata ucraina RBC: Putin ha chiesto di liberare Kursk entro il primo ottobre e l'obiettivo va centrato senza l'ausilio di reparti attualmente schierati nelle aree di Pokrovsk e Toretsk, nell'Ucraina orientale. Le forze armate di Kiev sono entrate in Russia il 6 agosto. Se anche la scadenza fissata da Putin venisse rispettata, il Cremlino dovrebbe giustificare la presenza degli invasori sul suolo nazionale per circa 2 mesi. Il presidente avrebbe preso in considerazione una nuova mobilitazione per contrastare l'avanzata nemica, ma l'ipotesi sarebbe stata accantonata per le ricadute che un simile provvedimento avrebbe sull'economia. Rimane sullo sfondo la possibilità di continuare ad utilizzare coscritti, soldati di leva, nella regione di Kursk. Putin, all'inizio della guerra, ha annunciato che i coscritti non sarebbero stati impiegati in prima linea. Proprio giovanissimi militari di leva, però, circa 2 settimane fa si sono trovati a contrastare – con risultati pessimi – l'incursione ucraina.",

    "text": "On-air employees at Erie's WJET-TV/WFXP-TV vote overwhelmingly to join a union News anchors, reporters, meteorologists and other on-air employees at WJET-TV/WFXP-TV voted overwhelmingly Thursday to unionize with the Screen Actors Guild — American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, AFL-CIO. The vote was 11 to 4, according to a news release the employees and SAG-AFTRA released. \"We believe our union will strengthen WJET-TV as a station and make it a better source of news and information for viewers in the Erie community. Some of the most pressing issues we wanted to address by forming this union were staffing, wages, and the fair and uniform enforcement of company policies,\" the unit said in the release. Employees declined a request for interviews. A message seeking comment from Nexstar Media Group, which owns and operates the Erie television stations, was not immediately returned. On-air employees at WJET/WFXP began working with SAG-AFTRA in October and asked Nexstar management to recognize the union voluntarily in January. When that didn't happen, the employees worked with the union to schedule Thursday's vote. With Thursday's vote, Erie's three largest newsrooms are all unionized. WICU-TV/WSEE-TV on-air employees have belonged to SAG-AFTRA for decades, while reporters, assignment editors and photographers at the Erie Times-News formed the Erie Newspaper Guild (now Erie News Guild) in 1969. Other nonmanagement employees at WJET/WFXP and WICU/WSEE — including news photographers, engineers, news producers and editors — are already members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians — Communications Workers of America. The next step for the newly organized WJET/WFXP employees is to form a representative bargaining committee and negotiate their first contract with Nexstar. \"WJET employees who provide news and information to the community should be partners in the decision-making process that goes into carrying out that mission,\" SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement. \"Unionizing gives them the tools they need to make that happen, and we are delighted to welcome them into the ever-growing family of media station employees who have chosen to join SAG-AFTRA.\" Contact David Bruce at [dbruce@timesnews.com](mailto:dbruce@timesnews.com).
