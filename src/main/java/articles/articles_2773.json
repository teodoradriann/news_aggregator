    "text": "El Salvador's San Sebastian river has no fish. The runoff from a gold mine upstream, already shuttered two decades ago, has long killed them all.\nNow, residents fear the same fate for other rivers -- and the creatures and people depending on them -- after Congress, at President Nayib Bukele's request, reversed a ban on metal mining.\nBukele billed the move as a way of invigorating the Central American country's stagnant economy, but environmentalists and river-side communities fear the potential harms far outweigh any benefits.\nIn the community of Santa Rosa de Lima, a two-hour drive from the capital San Salvador, wastewater still flows directly into the San Sebastian river from a nearby hill where a gold mine operated for 100 years until 2006.\nThe site is still being illegally exploited by artisanal gold miners.\nOn a recent expedition to survey the river with a group of environmentalists, community leader Graciela Funes took a sample of the water and shook her head as she examined its unnatural copper color.\n\"We cannot allow this situation... We are human and we all need this vital liquid,\" the 67-year-old told AFP.\nIn 2016, a report by El Salvador's human rights ombudsman found that runoff from Santa Rosa de Lima's shuttered mine had \"severely impacted the quality and availability\" of water in the region.\nPeople who relied directly on the river had no option but to buy bottled water for drinking and cooking, it said.\nThe report contributed to El Salvador becoming the first country in the world, in 2017, to outlaw metal mining due to the harmful effects of chemicals such as cyanide and mercury used in the extraction process.\n- 'Pollution, poverty' - Last December, the mining ban was overturned after Bukele claimed El Salvador, a country of 6.6 million people, had \"potentially\" the largest gold deposits per square kilometer in the world.\nThe president mentioned a study -- written by unknown authors and which he did not share -- which found that mining a mere four percent of the country's gold deposits would bring in $131 billion.\nThis was equivalent to 380 percent of GDP, the president argued, and would \"change the economy of El Salvador overnight.\"\nBut activists point to the San Sebastian gold mine -- one of the most productive in Central America for much of the 20th century -- as a cautionary tale.\nThe mine was shuttered after US firm Commerce Group had its environmental license revoked over river pollution.\n\"The beneficiaries of mining here will be small groups of companies, whether national or transnational, powerful groups that will take the minerals and resources from our soil and leave behind... misfortune, pollution, poverty,\" said anti-mining activist Vidalina Morales, who joined Funes and others for the San Sebastian river analysis.\nEnvironmental defenders fear a return to metal extraction also threatens the Lempa river, which runs through several areas with mining potential and supplies water to 70 percent of the capital's inhabitants.\nWhile mining does have its supporters, including from Salvadorans who see it as a source of much-needed employment, others worry it could be a dangerous environmental gamble with paltry gains.\nFor economist Julia Martinez, it is hard to weigh the risks as \"we do not see a study that explains if that gold really exists.\"\nAnd Ricardo Navarro of the Salvadoran Center for Appropriate Technology, an environmental NGO, said gold in the country was found in small concentrations of one gram per ton of rock: \"much damage for little gold.\"\nmr-ob/fj/mar/mlr/mlm\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Partners/afp Recommended for you Transgender Policy\nDiscussion\nSubmit Topics and Questions Here Currently in Bangor\n42° Cloudy 42° / 32° 10 PM 43° 11 PM 43° 12 AM 44° 1 AM 45° 2 AM 46° Storm Cancellations\nSubmit Cancellations Here Trending Videos What's on Tonight?

    "text": "Colombo, Sri Lanka December 5, 2024 – This year, the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka proudly marks the 20th anniversary of the English Access Scholarship Programme (Access), a free, transformative initiative that has empowered over 1,300 Sri Lankan youth with English language skills, leadership development and cross-cultural connections since its inception.\nLaunched globally in 2004 by the U.S. Department of State, the Access Programme provides economically disadvantaged students aged 13 to 15 with a robust foundation in English language skills. Through its free, two-year 360-hour curriculum, Sri Lankan youth gain leadership training, professional development opportunities, and exposure to U.S. culture and democratic values.\nThese Access experiences open doors to better educational and career opportunities and prepare students to compete for future exchanges and study programmes in the United States.\n“Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the English Access Scholarship Programme in Sri Lanka is a testament to our enduring commitment to empowering youth through education,” said U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung. “This programme not only provides essential English language skills but also fosters leadership, professional development, and cross-cultural understanding. By bridging communities and creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged students, we are investing in a brighter, more inclusive future for all.”\nThe Access Programme doesn’t just transform students’ lives—it also strengthens English teaching in Sri Lanka and connects students to the global Access network and peers from all corners of the island. Access teachers get top-notch training and join a global Community of Practice, along with opportunities to attend national and regional conferences. Earlier this year, 34 Sri Lankan educators, coordinators, and alumni joined the 20th Anniversary Regional Summit in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n“The English Access Scholarship Programme has been a key part of how we’re expanding educational opportunities and building stronger ties between the United States and Sri Lanka,” said U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer Heidi Hattenbach. “In a country rebuilding after conflict, Access has done so much more than teach English—it brings students and teachers together from diverse backgrounds, connects them to a global network, and gives them the skills and confidence to chase their dreams while fostering understanding and collaboration across communities.”\nAccess providers have emphasized connecting students from diverse backgrounds, using English as a bridge language. These bonds often transcend ethnic and religious differences, creating lifelong connections. As Mathangi, an Access alumna from Jaffna, shared, “Access transformed the way I connect with others, giving me the confidence to engage with people from diverse backgrounds and the skills to speak and present with clarity and self-assurance.”\nTo mark this 20th anniversary milestone, a four-day camp in Kandy will bring together 150 current Access students and teachers from Jaffna, Galle, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, and Nuwara Eliya. The event will feature interactive sessions led by Georgetown University-sponsored English Language Fellows, a community service project, and a “Culture Night” showcasing students’ unique experiences. Ambassador Julie Chung will join as a special guest, alongside other speakers.\nStarting with just 56 students from Sri Lanka’s Western Province, Access now boasts alumni from over 50 locations nationwide, including Kandy, home to the programme’s largest alumni cohort of 185. For the upcoming 2025-2027 cycle, the programme will enrol 150 new students from schools in Jaffna, Nuwara Eliya, Batticaloa, Ampara, Puttalam, and Ratnapura.\nThe U.S. Embassy and its local Access partners are proud to offer this free programme, continuing the legacy of enhancing English language and leadership skills and while cross-cultural connections in Sri Lanka and beyond.\nFor more information about U.S. initiatives in Sri Lanka, visit https://lk.usembassy.gov/ and follow @USEmbassySL on social media.",

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
