    "text": "MOUNT CLEMENS, Michigan ( WXYZ ) — A life-saving scene played out on a busy stretch of Gratiot Avenue last week with a heroic act by a Macomb County sheriff’s deputy.    \nDeputies Nicole Miron and Anthony Gross were notified on Sept. 12 around 2:15 p.m. that a silver GMC Sierra pickup truck was driving erratically in Mount Clemens on southbound Gratiot Avenue near Church Street.\n“I pretty much hung out the window as much as I possibly could and the vehicle was pretty close so didn’t make it too tough,” Miron said.\nThey found the driver on Gratiot Avenue near Remick Drive and turned on their lights and siren, but the 63-year-old driver failed to stop and continued on at about 5 mph.\n“So once I get in, I realized the park’s right at the steering wheel. I put it into park immediately… checked on him, he was in a daze, he wasn’t sure what was going on,” Miron added.\nGross was driving and Miron rolled down her window and tried to get the driver to stop, but he appeared to be in a daze. The driver managed to briefly hit his brakes and that’s when Miron climbed from her passenger seat into the moving truck. The deputy was able to stop the truck.\n“Once she started hanging out the window, I was just trying to keep us aligned with him,” Gross said.\n“Luckily, I am very small. When I went through the window, it was a big-size front kind of window, I was able to slide right through. I don’t think any of my gun or gear touched him, so I slid through, my small stature helped and the fact that we were a two-man car helped,” Miron told us on Wednesday.\nThe Clinton Township Fire Department was called in to treat the driver and he was taken to the hospital. His family was alerted.\nIt appears the driver had experienced a medical episode.\n“I commend Deputy Miron for putting herself in harm’s way to help a citizen in need and protect other drivers on the roadway,” Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham said in a statement. “Due to her quick thinking and selfless actions, she safely ended what could have been a tragic situation.”",

    "text": "BBB25: Sem atitude? Maike lamenta situação com sister: 'Olhantes até quando?'\nDurante festa do BBB25, Maike lamenta situação com colega de confinamento após troca de olhares; confira!\nMaike conversou com Gabriel durante o after do Show de Quarta na madrugada desta quinta-feira (30) no BBB25. O assunto girou em torno de seu interesse por uma das participantes do reality. Em meio a um momento de descontração, o brother fez uma revelação sobre um papo recente com a sister.\n\"E aí, a gente vai ser 'olhantes' até quando?\", questionou ele, ao que ela respondeu: \"Até você se decidir\". Gabriel, por sua vez, comentou sobre a situação de forma crítica: \"Você se coloca em cada situação...\". Isso sugere que a indecisão de Maike pode não apenas afetar suas relações pessoais, mas também sua estratégia dentro da competição.\nIndecisão entre Giovanna e Renata\nAo longo das últimas semanas, Maike tem mostrado interesse por duas pessoas, Giovanna e Renata. Ele frequentemente elogia Giovanna, irmã de Gracyanne Barbosa, e até fez piadas envolvendo o ex-marido da musa fitness, o cantor Belo. No entanto, Giovanna expressou preocupação quanto à indecisão de Maike, insinuando que essa hesitação está afetando sua imagem no jogo.\nDurante as festas do programa, Maike já teve momentos de dança íntima com as duas. Na última festa, ele chegou a confessar para Giovanna: \"Não sei se é a melhor hora no jogo, mas eu quero muito\".\nMAIKE QUESTIONA VILMA SOBRE BEIJO DE DIOGO E ALINE\nO beijo de Diogo e Aline agitou a madrugada desta quinta-feira (30) no BBB25. Mas o que será que achou a mãe do ator ao ver o filho trocando carícias com a policial? Questionada por Maike sobre a situação, dona Vilma foi direta na resposta.\nNo ambiente descontraído do jardim da casa, o representante comercial levantou uma questão que despertou curiosidade: \"A senhora faz muito gosto da sua nora? Ela é linda, né?\". Vilma, respondendo de forma entusiasmada, comentou: \"Faço! Não conheço ainda, mas aparentemente é gente boa. Eu bato palma para todas as noras que apareceram na minha vida. O relacionamento acaba, mas somos amigas. A gente mantém uma relação\". Clique e leia na íntegra!",

    "text": "TLDR - Network activity on Mina Protocol (MINA) has risen significantly due to the current market bullishness. - MINA had soared in November due to increased trading activity for cryptocurrencies. - NuggetRush (NUGX) could become one of the top crypto investments in 2024 after recording stellar numbers in its presale. Mina Protocol’s bullish momentum has doubled amid growing calls for spot crypto ETFs. Now, analysts say Mina Protocol could rally throughout Q1 2024. Yet, [NuggetRush’s (NUGX](https://nuggetrush.io?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=fbd&utm_content=55)) gaming adventures have set a new tone in the market after selling over 130 million tokens in its presale. Investors are now rapidly joining its ecosystem. Yet, can it become one of the top DeFi projects? Mina Protocol Capitalizes on Demand for Spot Crypto ETFs In early November 2023, the crypto market recorded increased bullishness due to growing demand for spot crypto ETFs. Mina Protocol (MINA) soared impressively alongside several cryptocurrencies. Data from CoinMarketCap also showed a $1 billion increase in Mina Protocol’s market capitalization since mid-October. MINA’s value as of October 31 stood at $0.5903. Four weeks later, MINA jumped by 20.9% to $0.7141 by November 30. As the market bullishness increased, MINA leaped by 102.7% to $1.4477 by December 2023. Mina Protocol (MINA) underwent significant network upgrades in 2023, significantly boosting its network activity. Analysts say this positions Mina Protocol to capitalize on the current bull run. Already, the market is abuzz with rumors that the SEC might approve the first spot crypto ETFs in January 2024. If this happens, the trading activity Mina Protocol could rise further, thus pushing MINA’s value up by 27.6% to $1.8487. Analysts say Mina Protocol (MINA) could become one of the top crypto coins if it remains bullish. NuggetRush: Innovative Meme Coin Unveils Mining Paradise with NFT Rewards [NuggetRush (NUGX](https://nuggetrush.io?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=fbd&utm_content=55)) is a meme coin ecosystem with an innovative concept and immense growth potential. It combines P2E, GameFi, and meme coin culture. At the center of NuggetRush lies a mining experience with exciting challenges and NFT rewards. On NuggetRush (NUGX), players become miners looking for mineral-rich lands to cultivate. The gameplay includes recruiting a workforce and collecting appropriate mining equipment. This part requires critical decision-making and resource management skills. After excavating natural resources, players will sell them on NuggetRush’s (NUGX) marketplace. Selling of mineral resources leaves players with revenue they can invest into expanding their mining activities. The more mines you can set up, the more resources you can sell. Another factor that affects reward eligibility is the efficiency of your mining operations. However, all players will receive NuggetRush (NUGX) rewards despite their particular location in the mining game. NuggetRush’s (NUGX) blockchain ICO continues to shatter expectations after selling over 130 million tokens. Revenue from NUGX sales has now crossed $1.45 million. Yet, the project is only in round four of its presale. NUGX’s current price is $0.015. It has already grown by 50% from its initial value. By round five of its presale, NUGX will jump by another 20% to $0.018. [Visit NuggetRush Presale Website](https://nuggetrush.io?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=fbd&utm_content=55)",

    "text": "The villagers of Ramanathapuram city, Tamil Nadu named a road after the Union Finance Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman. This recognition comes after the Minister advocated for the construction of a flyover in Landhai village located near Ramanathapuram. The villagers had been protesting for over 14 years demanding the closure of a railway tunnel and construction of a flyover in Landhai village to significantly benefit the affected communities. In response, Sitharaman took a proactive approach by requesting funds for the flyover project. Through a video conference, Sitharaman stated that the flyover construction is expected to be completed within four months. A bridge will also be built soon to protect the agriculture and livelihoods of 2,000 people. She urged full public cooperation to ensure timely completion. Earlier, during a flood relief visit, the Bharatiya Janata Party President of Ramanathapuram District had informed the State President and Sitharaman directly about the villagers’ demand. Subsequently, Sitharaman visited Landhai village and received a petition regarding the demand from the public. On the first day of receiving the petition, Rs. 17 crore and 32 lakhs were allocated for Lantai village. The people of Lanthai village and five nearby villages started celebrating upon learning about fund allocation for the flyover project. A special resolution was passed during a village meeting thanking the District BJP President. The road board was unveiled naming the road after Sitharaman in recognition of her facilitating the fund allocation for the flyover construction. Several leaders from the local BJP unit, including the District President, Agriculture Team State Secretary and District General Secretary were present on the occasion.",

    "text": "Former Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs has been found guilty in an Alabama court of animal cruelty charges, Tuscaloosa County court records show. Buggs was arrested in May and charged with two counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty. He was sentenced on July 19 to “365 days of hard labor for Tuscaloosa County” and ordered to serve 60 days with credit from July 16, 2024, court documents show. “It is hereby ordered and adjudged that the execution of the remaining 300 days be suspended for 2 years, pending the behavior of the defendant,” the judge’s order states. Buggs cannot possess or be around firearms and shall not own dogs or cats, it adds. He has appealed the sentencing. “There was no guilty plea in the dog abuse case. Per District Court rules, he pled not guilty but stipulated to the underlying facts so the judge could find him guilty and he could appeal for the right to have a jury trial. He was released from jail on bond. The trial will be set in the future,” Buggs’ attorney Greg Gambril told CNN. Buggs’ agent Trey Robinson said he had no comment at this time. Buggs also has a pending domestic violence case in the county stemming from an arrest in June. At the time of that arrest, his agent told the NFL Network that Buggs “vehemently denies” the animal cruelty allegations, adding that the dogs didn’t belong to him. Robinson also said his client was being targeted as part of an ongoing “subversive campaign” to force the closure of a hookah lounge he owns in Tuscaloosa. The domestic violence case is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in August. Buggs was drafted in the sixth round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was also a member of the Las Vegas Raiders and Detroit Lions before signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, where he was on the practice squad. He received a ring after the team won Super Bowl LVIII earlier in 2024. He was later released and is currently a free agent.",

    "title": "Matildas humbled 3-0 in Olympics opener by Germany - Network Ten",
    "text": "Captain Steph Catley admits the Matildas have been given a noisy wake-up alarm at the start of their Olympics quest after being outclassed 3-0 by powerhouse Germany on a stifling, dispiriting night in the south of France. The World Cup semi-finalists, seeking their first ever Olympic medal, were simply not allowed to find their stride against the accomplished former champions in Marseille on Thursday, on the eve of the Games start in Paris 750km away. Germany, inspired by their brilliant winger Jule Brand, could easily have won by six or seven and the bruising setback in group B leaves Tony Gustavsson's side immediately on the back foot in a tough group also featuring the powerful US side. It means the Matildas, who were fourth both in the Tokyo Games and last year's World Cup, must win their next match in Nice on Sunday against Zambia - beaten 3-0 by the US later on Thursday - or their hopes of making the quarter-finals could be quickly over. \"It's definitely a wake-up call,\" Catley, who overcame injury fears to lead the team, conceded to Channel 9 afterwards, admitting the performance had not been up to their normal standard on a sweltering evening on the Cote d'Azur. \"That's tournament football. We've got two more games and we've got to turn it around quickly. \"We've got a lot to learn from here. I think at times we were on top and we let two set-pieces affect the game in a very negative way.\" To suggest her side had been on top for spells felt like stretching credulity as they barely created a worthwhile chance, with their best approach work invariably being scuppered by one poor pass or cross. The Germans were decisive winners with two headed goals for Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller from corners, before Brand fittingly wrapped up the most comprehensive of victories after a fine team move. Yet the victory could have been much heavier if not for a touch of profligacy in front of goal from Germany's forwards. The Australians, who'd suffered a blow beforehand with injury forcing Tameka Yallop out of the squad, were run ragged by Wolfsburg's 21-year-old star Brand, who showed why she's on Barcelona's wanted list as she constantly carved through the green-and-gold rearguard. She had already missed one golden chance and Germany could have been two up before they broke through with Giulia Gwinn's 24th-minute pinpoint corner to the back post being met by a superbly timed downward header by Hegering, who had bullied her way through Ellie Carpenter and over Alanna Kennedy. Mary Fowler, who had an ineffective night up front, nearly responded immediately afterwards, but was dispossessed when she turned to fire in the box, and the Tillies did have a couple of speculative efforts through Caitlin Foord. Australia's defence was again broken down at the start of the second half when Clare Hunt got caught in possession by Brand. She freed Alex Popp, whose shot was brilliantly blocked by Kennedy. But the Australians were undone again from another Gwinn corner in the 64th minute when Schueller was left unmarked to head home from six metres out. Brand was then rewarded for her brilliance by tapping home four minutes later after a fine team move, starting from goalkeeper Berger, shredded the green-and-gold defence. The Germans had a fourth scrambled goal disallowed soon after for offside and threatened to inflict even more damage with the Tillies, who pushed in vain for a consolation after bringing on Michelle Heyman, surviving an even worse fate.
