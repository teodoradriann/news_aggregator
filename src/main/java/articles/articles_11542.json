Fans were none too happy with how the fierce showdown had a shocking turn towards the end. While Luka Doncic had another splendid night with 39 points, it wasn’t enough to pull the Mavs to safety. America’s Favorite Video Today Tonight, as Dallas is getting ready to face off against the Western Conference top-seeded Timberwolves, the Mavs PR has released a concerning injury update. Doncic will be absent from the game due to left quad soreness. And it doesn’t stop there. Kyrie Irving and Maxi Kleber are also still sidelined from right heel contusion and right small toe dislocation, respectively. Luka Dončić (left quad soreness), Kyrie Irving (right heel contusion) and Maxi Kleber (right small toe dislocation) will be OUT tonight against the Timberwolves. — Mavs PR (@MavsPR) [December 28, 2023] (This story is still developing) Providing feedback will help us make your experience better.

    "text": "TOPLINE:\nIvosidenib combined with azacitidine extended median overall survival to 29.3 months compared with 7.9 months for placebo plus azacitidine in newly diagnosed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The combination therapy also improved hematologic recovery and increased transfusion independence rate to 53.8% vs 17.1% with placebo.\nMETHODOLOGY:\n- A total of 148 patients with newly diagnosed IDH1-mutated AML who were unfit for intensive chemotherapy were randomized to receive either ivosidenib-azacitidine (n = 73) or placebo-azacitidine (n = 75).\n- Treatment consisted of 500 mg ivosidenib or placebo administered orally once daily, combined with subcutaneous or intravenous 75 mg/m² azacitidine for 7 days in 28-day cycles, with randomization stratified by geographic region and disease status.\n- Analysis included a median follow-up period of 28.6 months, with overall survival as the key outcome measure, along with hematologic recovery, transfusion independence, and molecular measurable residual disease response.\nTAKEAWAY:\n- Median overall survival was significantly longer with ivosidenib-azacitidine at 29.3 months (95% CI, 13.2-not reached) compared to 7.9 months (95% CI, 4.1-11.3) with placebo-azacitidine (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27-0.65; P < .0001).\n- Among patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline, conversion to transfusion independence was achieved in 53.8% (21/39) of ivosidenib-azacitidine patients vs 17.1% (7/41) of placebo-azacitidine patients (P = .0004).\n- Of 33 ivosidenib-treated patients evaluable for molecular measurable residual disease, 10 (30.3%) achieved MRD negativity by day 1 of cycle 14, all of whom had complete remission.\n- The safety profile remained consistent with previous reports, with lower rates of febrile neutropenia and infections in the ivosidenib-azacitidine arm, though neutropenia and bleeding events were more common than with placebo.\nIN PRACTICE:\n“These long-term efficacy and safety results confirm the benefit of ivosidenib-azacitidine in this challenging-to-treat population and support its use as a standard of care with the longest reported survival benefit for intensive chemotherapy-ineligible patients with IDH1-mutated AML,” the authors of the study wrote.\nSOURCE:\nThe study was led by Pau Montesinos, Hospital Universitari i Politécnic La Fe in Valencia, Spain, and Hartmut Döhner, Ulm University Hospital in Ulm, Germany. It was published online in Blood Advances.\nLIMITATIONS:\nAccording to the authors, molecular response analysis was limited by the small number of measurable residual disease-evaluable patients and samples, as well as the discontinuation of sample collection after study unblinding in March 2021. The limited number of variants that could be tracked with sufficient sensitivity in panel-based next-generation sequencing measurable residual disease assessment also constrained the molecular analyses.\nDISCLOSURES:\nMontesinos disclosed having relationships with AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Daiichi Sankyo, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Servier, and Teva Pharmaceuticals. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.\nThis article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

    "text": "Amid the recent favorable price action within the market, several stocks are nearing or breaking 52-week highs, including Shopify ( SHOP Quick Quote SHOP - Free Report ) , The Gap ( GPS Quick Quote GPS - Free Report ) , and StoneCo ( STNE Quick Quote STNE - Free Report ) .\nAnd in addition to recent momentum, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward earnings estimate revisions among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each for those who like to tap into relative strength.\nShopify\nShopify shares have been monster performers in 2023, up more than 100% amid a broader rebound for growth stocks overall.\nThe company has seen positive earnings estimate revisions across multiple timeframes, landing it into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShopify’s growth expectations are impossible to ignore, with consensus expectations for its current year (FY23) suggesting 1650% earnings growth on 25% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY24, consensus estimates allude to a further 50% earnings growth paired with a 20% sales bump.\nThe Gap\nWith more than 3,800 stores worldwide, The Gap is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories, and personal care products. Like SHOP, analysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board in a big way.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestors also stand to reap an income stream from GPS shares, currently yielding a solid 2.8% annually. Still, it’s worth noting that the company’s payout hasn’t increased for some time, perhaps steering away those with an income-focused approach.\nThe company has consistently blown away quarterly expectations as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 140% across its last four releases. Just in its latest print, GPS posted a 190% EPS beat and reported revenue 4% ahead of the consensus.\nShares saw a considerable boost post-earnings, as we can see illustrated below by the green arrow.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStoneCo\nStoneCo, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), offers an end-to-end cloud-based technology platform to conduct electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across all timeframes.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLike SHOP, it’s hard to ignore the company’s growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 170% in its current year on 10% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY24, consensus expectations suggest an additional 35% of earnings growth paired with a 13% revenue increase.\nShares aren’t overly expensive given the forecasted growth, with the current 21.1X forward earnings multiple well beneath the 42.5X five-year median and highs of 140.2X in 2020. The stock sports a Style Score of “C” for Value.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nRelative strength investing is all about riding the trend. And when you add in rising earnings estimate revisions, these stocks have the fuel needed to continue climbing.\nFor those seeking stocks with strong momentum and a brightened earnings outlook, all three above – Shopify ( SHOP Quick Quote SHOP - Free Report ) , The Gap ( GPS Quick Quote GPS - Free Report ) , and StoneCo ( STNE Quick Quote STNE - Free Report ) – fit the criteria nicely.",

    "text": "Dense fog warning issued in Delhi, 4 other north Indian states till December 31\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast dense to very dense fog to continue across north Indian states till December 30. Cold day conditions have also been predicted to remain in parts of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, according to the IMD bulletin.\nThe Met Department stated that fog conditions would begin improving from December 31 morning onwards.\nAmid icy cold conditions, schools remain closed in Gautam Buddh Nagar – consisting of Noida and Greater Noida. The district administration ordered closure of schools for students for December 29 and 30. However, teachers and other staffers would work.\nThe IMD, meanwhile, predicted the minimum temperature to hover around seven to eight degrees Celsius over the next five days. On Thursday, the national capital’s minimum temperature settled at 8.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above the season’s average, while the maximum temperature was recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius, also one notch above normal.\nVisuals on social media showed people sleeping inside shelter homes in Delhi. A video shared by news agency ANI showed visibility almost completely reduced at Thursday midnight in areas around the Indira Gandhi International Airport.\nThese dense fog conditions have heavily impacted transport services, hitting flights and train operations that have been marred by multiple cancellations and delays.\nMeanwhile, at least six people were killed, and 12 others were injured in two separate road accidents in Uttar Pradesh due to reduced visibility on Thursday, police told news agency PTI.\nIn an advisory for dense fog, the Met department has asked drivers to use fog lights and travellers to stay updated on schedules of airlines, railways and state transport. “Exercise caution while driving or using any mode of transportation,” the IMD said.\nWatch Live TV in English\nWatch Live TV in Hindi",

    "text": "Mexico grapples with an energy crisis as scorching heat waves drive electricity consumption to unprecedented levels.\nRolling blackouts now disrupt life in both bustling cities and tranquil rural areas nationwide.\nRegions like Tamaulipas saw temperatures soar above 48°C, while Gallinas reported an astonishing 49.6°C, nearly unthinkable until now.\nMeanwhile, the heat wave affects not only the northeast but also various other regions, indicating a broader climate challenge.\nIn April, Mexico City shattered its 1998 heat record, reaching 34.2°C. This escalation signals not just a statistical anomaly but a growing climate volatility.\nMexico Faces Energy Crisis Amid Scorching Heat Wave. (Photo Internet reproduction) President Andrés Manuel López Obrador acknowledges the crisis, confirming electricity demand surpasses supply.\nHis administration pledges continued monitoring and response efforts.\nFrequent power cuts, strategically deployed to stabilize the grid, reveal the delicate balance between energy supply and demand.\nThis problem extends beyond Mexico. Costa Rica , Ecuador, and Colombia also face energy rationing due to water shortages that affect hydroelectric power generation.\nSuch scenarios underline the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions and climate resilience strategies.\nDeclining reservoir levels threaten not only agriculture but also many other critical industries.\nThis scenario raises urgent questions about future water and energy security amid a warming world.\nTherefore, innovative approaches to energy management and climate adaptation require immediate prioritization.",
