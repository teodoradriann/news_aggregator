    "text": "Taking to Instagram, the couple posted a video that showed a man attempting to forcefully kiss the woman after talking to her.\nIn the video, the guy said a man in his 50s sexually assaulted him and he had to push him away.\n\"We had a wonderful time at Thrissur Pooram, but there were also some questionable moments,\" the couple mentioned at the beginning of the video.\nIn the video, the duo also alleged that the people 'were a bit frisky.'\nThe Kerala police said they had not received any complaint from the couple in connection with the incident. \"We have not received any complaints in this regard until now,\" police said, adding that an accused man in the video has been identified.\nThere have been multiple incidents in the past when foreign tourists have alleged sexual harassment. Earlier this year, another tourist couple had alleged sexual harassment in Jharkhand. The tourist couple later released a 59-minute-long video documenting the events leading up to and following the traumatic incident.\nNarrating the incident the couple said in their video posted on YouTube. \"The truth is that we didn't know if we were going to put it. A lot has been said, some things were true, others were lies, we want to reflect in our own hands what really happened. After this long chapter, we will put an end to this unpleasant stage and return to the previous chapters…\"\nThe Jharkhand Police had apprehended eight individuals in connection with the case earlier. In addition, the police also provided a compensation of ₹10 lakh to the the victim's husband.\n(With inputs from Press Trust of India)\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "text": "Mikel Arteta admitted his side came up short in both boxes as Arsenal slumped to defeat to West Ham to miss out on regaining top spot in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners remain behind Liverpool as they lost 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium on what Arteta conceded was one of the most frustrating nights of his four-year tenure as Arsenal boss.\nTomas Soucek’s opener – awarded after the VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build up – and a second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos earned the visitors a deserved win.\nA defence masterclass from David Moyes’ side\n[#FestiveFixtures] [pic.twitter.com/yN2hZVa5SN]\n— Premier League (@premierleague)\n[December 28, 2023]\nThings could have been even better had Said Benrahma not had a stoppage-time penalty saved by David Raya on a night where Arteta applauded the performances of the opposition.\n“I congratulate West Ham and praise my players. That’s what I can tell you,” he said.\n“This is football. When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing. But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30.\n“If we don’t score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That’s the only thing. I can’t imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn’t enough to win the game.”\nAsked if it was among the most frustrating nights of his managerial career, Arteta replied: “It is. But it’s football. Normally when the team generates so much it’s going to win games.\n“That’s the way we’ve done it. Against Brighton, we generated so much and against Liverpool as well, but we score goals in different ways.\n“We have to make another step in that area to win games more comfortably, that’s for sure, because today the team deserves to win the game. There’s no question about that.”\nArteta successfully fought a Football Association charge after he criticised the officiating and VAR in defeat at Newcastle last month and was less vocal this time.\nHe did, however, suggest technology needs to be further advanced to make close calls, adding: “They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have, that it’s not that clear so that we can say whether it’s out or in. It’s done. It’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it now.\n“If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game. With the number of situations we generated in the game, that should have been more than enough.”\nFor West Ham and manager David Moyes, this was a rare taste of victory at the Emirates Stadium – Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United.\nWest Ham were 17th at the turn of the year but went on to win the Europa Conference League and now sit just four points off the top four after this hard-fought and deserved win.\nMoyes is out of contract in the summer but, on the four-year anniversary of his reappointment as West Ham boss, feels a new deal will soon be ironed out.\n“We’re getting ready to talk,” he told Amazon Prime.\n“I don’t think any of us are jumping to get it done too quickly, I think we are just happy to make sure we get it done. We will do, I don’t see any problems with that at all.\n“We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe is a great period.”\nSoccer News Like\n- Be the first of your friends!",

    "text": "Pope Francis remained in critical condition on Sunday and blood tests show early kidney failure but he remains alert, the Vatican said, as the 88-year-old pontiff battles pneumonia and a complex lung infection.\nIn a late update, the Vatican said Francis had not had any more respiratory crises since Saturday night but was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen.\nSome blood tests showed “initial, mild, kidney failure”, but doctors said it was under control.\nThe decreased platelet count, necessary for clotting, that was first detected on Saturday was stable.\nPrayers for him poured in from around the world, from his native Argentina to the seat of Sunni Islam in Cairo to schoolchildren in Rome.\nFrancis was supposed to have celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in St Peter’s Basilica and ordained deacons as part of the Vatican’s year-long Holy Year commemoration.\nThe organiser of the Holy Year, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, celebrated the Mass in his place and offered a special prayer for Francis from the altar before delivering the homily the pope had prepared.\nA pre-written message that had been prepared for Francis to read Sunday but did not deliver said he was “confidently continuing my hospitalisation at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment; and rest is also part of the therapy!”\nThe message asked for prayers for him — as he always asks — and noted the upcoming anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity”.\nMeanwhile in Francis’ native Argentina, Catholics prayed for the pope at the Buenos Aires cathedral and the city’s iconic obelisk was lit up “Francis, the city prays for you.”\nIn Cairo, the grand imam of Al-Azhar, the seat of Sunni learning who forged a close bond with Francis, wished him well.\nAnd school children from around Rome deluged the Gemelli hospital with get-well cards, while Italian bishops led rosary prayers and celebrated special Masses across Italy.",

    "text": "El primer representante permanente adjunto de Rusia ante la Organización de Naciones Unidas (ONU), Dmitri Polianski, remarcó este jueves que su país ha propuesto al Consejo de Seguridad que se adopte una nueva resolución para alcanzar una tregua en la Franja de Gaza al incumplirse el protocolo. LEA TAMBIÉN: Ascienden a 40.265 los palestinos asesinados por Israel en Gaza “Si la resolución 2735 no se respeta, adoptemos un nuevo documento que envíe un mensaje claro a los saboteadores de que sus acciones no se quedarán sin consecuencias, y proporcionemos a nuestra resolución instrumentos que ayuden a detener la violencia, independientemente de los caprichos de una u otra parte del conflicto”, manifestó el diplomático ruso. Al referir que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU adoptó la resolución 2735 basada en el plan del presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden, Dmitri Polianski recalcó que “es precisamente el deseo maníaco de Estados Unidos de ‘monopolizar’ el proceso de paz en Oriente Medio y de remodelarlo según ‘modelos’ adecuados a Israel lo que ha llevado a las dramáticas consecuencias que estamos presenciando hoy”. Asimismo, el representante ruso manifestó que esta situación socava la credibilidad del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, mientras puntualizó que este organismo no ha sido eficiente para una solución justa de la cuestión palestina. “Desde octubre pasado no ha sido capaz de adoptar ninguna decisión efectiva, necesaria no sólo para una solución justa de la cuestión palestina de conformidad con nuestras resoluciones pertinentes, sino también para prevenir una guerra regional en Oriente Medio”, remarcó Dmitri Polianski. “¿Cuánto tiempo más vamos a permanecer de brazos cruzados, mientras los aspirantes a mediadores estadounidenses siguen dando espectáculo y alimentándonos con promesas vacías de que sus esfuerzos diplomáticos «sobre el terreno» traerán resultados rápidos?”, reflexionó Polianski.
