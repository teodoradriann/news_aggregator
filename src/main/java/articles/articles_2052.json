Passengers who arrived at the airport but were not aware of the delays were seen sitting on the floors and waiting for an update from the airline.\nALSO READ Low visibility hits many parts of Delhi amid dense fog, trains delayed A forecast by the Met Department suggested that visibility may reduce to 0050 metres in very dense fog and it may improve to 0400 metres in moderate fog today at the IGI airport. Passengers complained of difficulties and inconvenience caused due to delays in flights and trains.\nA passenger, Mohd Shahrukh complained that his flight was delayed by three hours. \"My flight is delayed by almost 3 hours. We had to attend an important event but due to this delay, we will not be able to attend it. A lot of people are facing difficulties due to the delay of flights,\" he said.\n\"I have been waiting for 12 hours at T-3 in the cold to catch a flight to Sharjah. The airline made no arrangements for passengers in case of delay in such weather,\" said Fakrool, a native of Rampur in U.P. According to airport sources, visibility on December 29 fell to 150 metres, which is considered moderate for flight operations.\nALSO READ Cold wave tightens grip on north India, Delhi shivers in dense fog with 'Very Poor' air quality \"No diversions have been reported till 8 a.m. on Dec. 29.

    "text": "Política\nLectura 4:00 min\nEn abril el INEA alfabetiza a 456 mil 163 jóvenes y adultos en todo el país: Mario Delgado\n- Se fortalece la Estrategia Nacional para la Alfabetización, impulsada por el Gobierno de la Presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo.\n- Esta semana el director general del INEA, Armando Contreras Castillo, firmó acuerdos con los gobiernos de Morelos y Zacatecas en beneficio de 50 mil personas que aún no saben leer ni escribir.\nLa Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP) alfabetiza, durante el mes de abril, a 456 mil 163 jóvenes y adultos de todo el país mediante los servicios educativos gratuitos que ofrece el Instituto Nacional para la Educación de los Adultos (INEA), informó el titular de la dependencia, Mario Delgado Carrillo.\nResaltó que la oferta educativa del INEA está dirigida a personas de 15 años en adelante que no tuvieron la oportunidad de cursar o concluir su Educación Básica en el sistema escolarizado, ofreciéndoles servicios de alfabetización en español y lenguas indígenas, con un enfoque bilingüe para comunidades originarias, así como educación primaria y secundaria con certificación oficial de la SEP.\nDestacó que estas acciones forman parte de la Estrategia Nacional para la Alfabetización, impulsada por el Gobierno de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, a través de la cual el INEA ofrece alternativas de estudio y horarios flexibles que permiten cursar la primaria y la secundaria en línea, desde un dispositivo electrónico, así como acreditar los niveles de Educación Básica mediante exámenes y con el acompañamiento de guías de estudio.\nDelgado Carrillo afirmó que la alfabetización es la base de la educación, de la identidad y de la diversidad cultural, ya que permite comprender mejor al otro, entender lo que nos hace diferentes, y sentir empatía, compasión y solidaridad.\nPor su parte el director general del INEA, Armado Contreras Castillo, recordó que, en sus 43 años de existencia, el Instituto ha brindado servicios a más de 31 millones de mujeres y hombres, a través de su programa de educación especializada para personas adultas, con el objetivo de que puedan concluir sus estudios y ejercer su derecho a una educación libre y gratuita.\nMencionó que el modelo educativo del INEA opera bajo los principios de la Nueva Escuela Mexicana (NEM) y del humanismo mexicano, brindando un acompañamiento educativo de calidad que sitúa a las personas educandas en el centro del proceso formativo, y promueve valores de igualdad, amor y conciencia para fomentar una cultura de paz.\nAñadió que, de acuerdo con la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura (UNESCO), para construir una cultura de paz son necesarias actividades educativas, culturales, sociales y cívicas de carácter general, que ofrezcan la oportunidad de aprender, dar y compartir.\nFinalmente, señaló que la atención educativa que brinda el INEA constituye una labor de conciencia social, en la que desempeña un papel fundamental el apoyo de personas voluntarias, quienes colaboran en distintas tareas de asesoramiento y acompañamiento durante el proceso educativo de quienes así lo requieren.\nINEA continua con la firma de acuerdos de la Estrategia Nacional para la Alfabetización\nCon el Gobierno del estado de Morelos se consolidó una alianza orientada a combatir el rezago educativo en la entidad, donde se estima que alrededor de 30 mil personas aún no saben leer ni escribir. El director general del INEA, Armando Contreras Castillo, y la gobernadora de la entidad, Margarita González Saravia, coincidieron en que la colaboración entre instituciones es clave para cumplir con la meta nacional de erradicar el analfabetismo en 2026.\nEn Zacatecas, el director general del INEA, Armando Contreras Castillo signó el convenio de colaboración “México Libre de Analfabetismo”, con el propósito de ampliar el acceso a la educación y avanzar hacia un estado con mayores oportunidades para todas y todos. Este acuerdo brindará atención educativa a cerca de 20 mil personas que aún no saben leer ni escribir.",

    "title": "Why New Homes Are the Smartest Real Estate Investment Today",
    "text": "In many ways, the housing market has always reflected broader societal and economic trends. For instance, there’s been an undeniable shift from home merely being a roof over your head to becoming more of a lifestyle decision – a choice about the type of life you want to lead, the aspirations you have, and the comfort your residence can offer. It’s against this backdrop that new homes have sprung up recently to take center stage. But are they a smart investment? Yes, they boast sleek designs, modern features, and excellent curb appeal, but are you better investing in a fixer-upper or investing in a brand-new, untouched home? The answer is a resounding “yes” to the former over the latter. So, let’s look at why that’s the case and how new homes might just present the smartest real estate investment out there today. Avoid the Headaches and Heartaches of Repairs and Renovations Perhaps the best place to start is with the most obvious benefit. When you receive the keys to your brand-new home, you set foot inside without needing to touch anything. All there is to do is unpack your belongings and start living your life. The same can’t be said for older homes. Old electrics, outdated plumbing, and hidden problems contained within the foundation slab may all serve to keep you up at night. And that’s the point. It’s not just the financial burden of putting these things right. It’s the emotional toll they can take. You can be happy in your home one minute, then deal with a burst pipe flooding your home the next. Of course, that’s not to say that all older homes have these issues. But they are far more likely to crop up, and you’re on the hook for them. With problems such as [slab leaks costing an average of $3,100 to fix](https://forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/slab-leak-repair-cost/), that’s a significant chunk of extra change you will have to find. By contrast, in the unlikely event you suffer a similar fate with a new home, you’re covered by warranties and guarantees. New Homes Offer Greater Longevity The other significant advantage these homes hold over older homes from existing housing stock is that they take advantage of the latest advances in materials and construction techniques to better stand the test of time. Modern insulation, higher-quality roofing, and even the entire design of homes have changed considerably in just the last decade. Building codes and standards are not set in stone. They are iterated every year (as they should be). For you as a buyer, that means you benefit from each and every improvement and enjoy a home built to the latest standards. You won’t have to think about replacing major systems or structural elements for at least over a decade, or maybe even at all, if you plan to move again in the longer term. Compare that with a home built in the early 2000s, when building codes weren’t as stringent, and materials weren’t the same quality. The best-case scenario will see you paying higher running costs and the occasional repair here and there. In the worst-case scenario, you’ll have to budget for significant remedial work. New Homes Often Come with Numerous Financial Incentives When buying a standard property, there are minimal financial incentives thrown your way. In fact, the only way to secure perks is by negotiating with the seller on aspects such as the sale price and fixtures and fittings. By contrast, new homes have all kinds of incentives to help sweeten the deal. For example, when you look at new home building companies such as [LGI Homes](https://www.lgihomes.com/), they offer all kinds of incentives – from interest rate buydowns on mortgages to builder-paid closing costs. They even, as part of their signature CompleteHome™ package, equip their houses with everything you could need, including top-tier Whirlpool® appliances. Those additions alone are worth thousands and save you from having to shop, finance, and install these crucial home features. However, there are even more financial incentives to be found if you scratch beneath the surface. Look at running costs, for example. With energy-efficient lighting, appliances, and Low-E windows, your utility bills may well be a fraction of the cost of an old and drafty home. Likewise, homeowners insurance premiums will be lower with better safety features and fewer risks. In short, not only do you save on costs upfront, but you also save money down the road. New Homes Retain Resale Value The appeal of buying an older home with work to do is that, once complete, those investments in renovations and decorations should make a healthy return. That is undoubtedly true in many cases, but that’s not to say that new homes also can’t offer solid resale value potential. Firstly, all their modern designs and features will appeal to future buyers and deliver a competitive edge in any resale market. But their surrounding communities also play a role. New homes are often built in master-planned communities, complete with community-only amenities such as swimming pools, parks, hiking and biking trails, fitness centers, and children’s play areas. Pair that with proximity to good schools and infrastructure like highways to major employment centers, and you’ve got a recipe for a desirable home come resale time. Lastly, these new home communities are often deliberately constructed in up-and-coming suburban areas that offer a much higher ceiling for growth than already established locations. So yes, you can opt to invest in an older home, make improvements, and reap the rewards. But you can enjoy similar returns without investing anywhere near as much time and money by buying new ones. New Homes: The Intelligent Play for Homeowners Looking for Good Investments Buying any home is a huge financial decision. So it’s only right that you want to get it right. But contrary to popular advice, buying brand new real estate might be the best way to not only protect your investment but enjoy the highest standard of living, too. From securing homes in move-in-ready condition to enjoying a whole host of financial incentives both before and after signing on the dotted line, there are very few valid reasons not to consider buying a new construction home. So, if you’re on the hunt for your next (or first) property, remember to bear these factors in mind rather than limiting yourself to existing housing stock within your chosen area.",

    "text": "This 34-inch Lenovo Legion Mini LED gaming monitor gets a lot (of ports) right By Esat Dedezade Published 6 hours ago It's bright and packed full of connectivity options. Oh, and it's currently 50% off.\nLenovo Readers like you help support Pocket-lint. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Read More. There's no shortage of ultrawide gaming monitors out there. From OLED offerings that dazzle the senses to super-bright Mini LED affairs that remain vibrant even in bright rooms, there's something out there to suit practically all needs.\nThe Lenovo Legion Y34wz-30 (to give it its full, rather clunky name) falls in the latter category. A 34-inch Mini LED ultrawide gaming monitor with a super-speedy 240Hz refresh rate and plenty of connectivity options, it's looking to woo you over with its relatively sensible aesthetics and performance. At typically $1,200/£900, though, it isn't cheap and falls pretty close to premium OLED monitor territory, which is, for many, the holy grail for gaming monitors. Until Micro LED becomes more mainstream, at least. Having said all that, you can currently find it 50% off at Lenovo US after the holidays.\nIs the Y34wz-30 worth it? Let's find out.\nLenovo Legion Y34wz-30 $600 $1200 Save $600 The Legion Y34wz-30 is fast, bright, and performs well. The ultrawide aspect ratio provides an immersive element to gaming while improving multitasking. While it’s too expensive compared to the competition, it's now half off at Lenovo. If you’re after flexible connectivity options, it’s hard to beat.\nPros Attractive pared-back design Large, immersive curved screen Strong HDR performance Cons Typically too expensive considering the competition Design won't suit all tastes $600 at Lenovo Design Curved screen with RGB flair\nPocket-lint Dimensions: 807.2 x 451.3 x 320.1mm Weight: 10.5kg Regarding gaming monitors, the Legion Y34wz-30 certainly isn't the most in-your-face offering when it comes to brash gamer aesthetics, which is no bad thing in my book. An all-black plastic affair (minus a grey bracing strip on the base), it should fit in rather nicely with more sensible desk aesthetics. The base, in fact, is probably the most striking thing about it and will probably divide opinions.\nAs a fan of architecture, I rather like the cross-braced, bridge-girder vibe it gives off, but it certainly won't appeal to everyone. Both feet of the stand are also more or less at a 90-degree angle while sticking out a fair amount. I found myself with plenty of room on my average-sized desk, mind, but it's something to bear in mind if space is tight and you tend to leave a lot of things on your desktop.\nWeighing a perfectly manageable 10.5kg, it's an absolute breeze to set up. I clipped on the arm and screwed in the stand (all toolless), carried it over to the desk without fuss, and was up and running within a minute of opening the box. Having struggled with fiddly monitor setups in the past, both my sanity and back were very grateful for the Y34wz-30's slick, manageable setup process. It's also very easy to adjust both the height and tilt, with plenty of wiggle room for both, making for a very comfortable, ergonomic setup.\nBeneath the screen, you'll find another clue to its gaming DNA in the form of a centralised RGB light strip , which diligently beams colourful lights down onto your desk. It's very subtle in well-lit conditions and adds a rather pleasant effect in low light. Naturally, you can turn it off, and given the hidden under-bezel location of the RGB strip itself, it's completely hidden from view. The built-in menu states that you can download Lenovo's Artery software for additional controls of the RGB functionality, but having installed it, I couldn't see anything related to it. Either way, I left it turned off for the most part and was perfectly happy with its scrolling RGB effect for those periods when I fancied a little extra ambience round the back.\nRelated Best gaming monitors: Top 4K, ultrawide and ultra fast monitors to buy A great monitor can be a huge upgrade for your PC, whether for gaming or work - these are our favourites. Features, connectivity, and sound Excellent connectivity and solid speakers Close Flip the Legion Y34wz-30, and you'll be met with a rather sensible black panel, with a central portion jutting out that houses all the ports . And what a generous selection there is. You'll find two HDMI 2.1 ports, DisplayPort 1.4, a USB-C port DP Alt Mode for video and data transfer, a second USB-C port for data, and four USB-A ports thrown in for good measure. Oh, and let's not forget the Ethernet port and headphone/audio out jack. Phew.\nThat's a pretty impressive selection by any standard, and it gets even better when you throw in the built-in KVM switch, which lets you control multiple connected PCs with the same keyboard and mouse. I only had one PC on hand during my testing, but if you regularly switch between two devices, the usefulness of this feature cannot be overstated.\n...\"What a generous selection there is. You'll find two HDMI 2.1 ports, DisplayPort 1.4, a USB-C port DP Alt Mode for video and data transfer, a second USB-C port for data, and four USB-A ports\".\nThe physical controls for turning the monitor on and off and navigating the menu can be found beneath the right-hand side of the screen, and it's one of the more accessible and more intuitive setups I've used. The large power button is all but impossible to miss, and clicking in the joystick to bring up the menu, navigate through the options, and select your settings is something that feels natural, with no frustrating guesswork required.\nAs for the sound, the Legion Y34wz-30 houses two 5W speakers. Naturally, they won't hold a candle to dedicated headphones, soundbars, or desktop speakers, but they'll get the job done as far as built-in monitor speakers go. Reaching surprisingly impressive volumes, you won't be left wanting for more, especially as things can get a little tinny and harsh when cranked to the max, with little bass to balance it out. You're more than likely planning to use a dedicated external sound output with whatever gaming monitor you choose to grace your desk, but it's at least reassuring to know that this one can hold its own without assistance, should the need arise.\nRelated Best monitor: Top displays for office use, gaming, and creatives The best monitors from Apple, Dell, HP, and more for every use, display size, and budget. Screen and performance Super-bright Mini LED panel and impressive contrast in HDR mode Close The Legion Y34wz-3's 34-inch 3,440 x 1,440 VA panel has a very gentle 1500R curvature, which I'd say is the perfect amount for a screen this size. It slightly envelops your view, but not to such an extent that it's distracting or desk-dominating. The panel itself uses a Mini LED backlight, though this only kicks in if HDR is turned on.\nWhen HDR is off, the experience isn't all that impressive, but you'll want to wear sunglasses once it's on. As a self-confessed OLED monitor lover, I even have to bow down to the power of Mini LED when it comes to brightness. The Y34wz-3 is eye-searing at max brightness, which is actually a good thing, as you can comfortably rest in the knowledge that you'll never be left wishing there was just a tad more in the tank.\nBlack levels are also far, far better in HDR mode. When turned off, blacks look more like a dark grey. Turned on, though, and they become a deliciously deep, rich black. And that's despite the rather low level of local dimming zones (just 384), which is a figure that a fair few competitors overtake. Without an OLED display in the same room to compare with, you'll be very content with the contrast and black levels on offer here.\nOverall, the black levels and HDR performance make for a very enjoyable gaming experience, particularly in titles like Baldur's Gate 3 , which have no shortage of dim, gloomy caves and dungeons to explore. With HDR mode on, the Legion Y34wz-30 is able to let me spy on hidden doors and enemies in darker environments, which my dark elf character found useful on more than once occasion. It has to be said that the wide 21:9 aspect ratio, combined with the slight curve of the screen, also makes for a more immersive gaming experience, letting me see more of my on-screen environment than traditional 16:9 displays.\nAs for the refresh rate, its 165Hz performance is more than enough for my middle-aged gaming reflexes. Its buttery-smooth performance is particularly notable in fast-paced games like Rocket League , and there's even an Overdrive mode which cranks things up to 180Hz. Now, there's no way my eyes can tell the difference between 165 and 180Hz, so this is more of a way to grab a bit of extra spec street cred in my eyes - especially the overclock in Overdrive mode automatically turns off after 30 minutes. Supporting AMD Freesync Premium Pro to reduce screen tearing is a nice feature for AMD GPU users, but I can also confirm that the Nvidia RTX 4090 used in my testing produced no screen tearing issues, as you'd expect with such a beefy card.\nRelated Best monitor stands: Gain space and better viewing angles with these tried and tested risers Working from home doesn't have to mean doing so with discomfort. Check out our picks for the top monitor risers. Verdict Solid monitor that gets plenty right\nLenovo Overall, the Lenovo Legion Y34wz-30 is a solid monitor that gets plenty right. From an unassuming, pared-back design to a beautifully bright, fast screen, intuitive controls, decent sound, and a plethora of connectivity options, there's a lot to like here.\n\"From an unassuming, pared-back design to a beautifully bright, fast screen, intuitive controls, decent sound, and a plethora of connectivity options, there's a lot to like here.\"\nIt is greatly let down by its steep $1,200/£900 price tag - especially as it only has 384 dimming zones to play with. However, it's currently on sale at Lenovo for $600 in the US. That's half off. For context, you can pick up the Alienware AW3423DWF for $799/£929 (though it's recently been as low as £740 on offer). It is widely regarded as one of the best gaming monitors ever made. It's an OLED affair, which, while dimmer, provides an incredibly punchy viewing experience thanks to its true, untouchable black levels and contrast.\nIn short, the Lenovo Legion Y34wz-30 dutifully fills a niche for those who desire a 34-inch ultrawide monitor with solid performance and - crucially - the plethora of connectivity options it offers, which sets it apart from the competition. If you're scared of OLED burn-in and need a super-bright gaming monitor with built-in functionality for multiple connectivity, then this should be on your consideration list.",
