    "text": "Sam Thompson has gushed over his \"special day\" with his two year old nephew as he admits to \"really becoming a part\" of his life.\nThe former\nMade in Chelsea star and King of the Jungle, 31, took to Instagram to share a heartwarming post after spending time with his nephew, the son of his sister Louise Thompson.\nSharing a video from the family day out, Sam gushed in the caption: \"Making memories that I’ll never forget. What a special day. Feel like I’m really becoming a part of my nephews life and it makes me so happy.\"\nIn the video, Sam could be seen enjoying breakfast out with his sister's partner\n Ryan Libbey and his nephew Leo, while his girlfriend Zara McDermott also joined for the festive outing. While they sat around the table, Sam asked Leo to sing the nursery rhyme Twinkle Twinkle Little Star which the tiny tot began with his small red guitar on his lap.\nThe adults sang along with Leo before he let out a loud noise in enjoyment while being surrounded by his family.\nIn another clip from Sam's post, he could be seen walking along the pavement sweetly holding Leo's hand before turning back and giving a huge smile at the camera.\nIt's no surprise that Sam is close with his nephew as he lives right next door to him and his sister in a sprawling Chelsea pad. Louise was quick to comment on the post of her brother and son writing the caption: \"Well this makes me want to cry\".\nZara commented \"same\" alongside a crying emoji over the sweet tribute. Louise also reposted the sweet video on her Instagram and added the caption: \"My blessings. So glad that finally everything is exactly as it should be\", along with three smiley emojis.\nIt comes after\nLouise admitted that she \"doesn't relish\" Christmas as she opened up about her feelings in a candid post. The former star, 33, has been open and honest about her mental health since Leo's traumatic birth in 2021. She's also been open about the health issues she's suffered since, often documenting her progress and thoughts on Instagram.\nOn Boxing Day, Louise took to Instagram to post some sweet snaps during a walk with Leo, as she shared that she struggles during the winter. She wrote: \"I’m not very good during the Winter months. Nor am I good on special occasions.\n\"So unlike most people I know I don’t relish the idea of\nChristmas. That’s my truth. I’ve gone and said it. Sorry to anyone I’ve offended. Including my beautiful family.\n\"Things might look gravy. And for the most part they are.\" The star continued: \"But somewhere inside me there still remains a few deep rooted niggles that are well and truly trapped within my psyche. I can try to blame my issues on chemical imbalances, hormonal insufficiencies or physical health problems…\"\nShe went on to share some of her battles and how she copes with these, including slowing down. The post continued in the comments section, where many people offered their support and praised her for her honesty.",

    "title": "Pope renews prayers for peace in Sudan as millions risk famine - Vatican News",
    "text": "Pope renews prayers for peace in Sudan as millions risk famine By Devin Watkins & Nathan Morley “I invite everyone to pray for Sudan, where the war that has lasted over a year has yet to find a peaceful solution. May weapons be silenced.” Pope Francis made that appeal on Sunday as he prayed the Angelus in St. Peter’s Square. The Pope urged international leaders and Sudanese authorities to help Sudan and its many displaced people. “May Sudanese refugees find welcome and protection in neighboring countries,” he added. Pope Francis also prayed for peace in “martyred Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and Myanmar.” “I appeal to the wisdom of leaders, so that escalation may cease and every effort may be spent in dialogue and negotiations,” he said. Millions at risk of famine in Sudan As the Pope appealed for peace, time seems to be running out for millions of people in Sudan, who are at imminent risk of famine. The country is embroiled in a second year of conflict between rival military factions and is home to the largest number of internally displaced people in the world. Now, as the war drags on, humanitarian organisations have sent a stark warning, saying the warring parties are preventing aid from reaching the population. This latest alarm comes after 19 international humanitarian groups, including 12 United Nations agencies, urged the warring parties to stop blocking food aid from reaching millions suffering from hunger. In the latest indication of the scope of the problem, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said Sudan’s 18 million hungry people will die if the aid does not start to flow. Children appear to be the prime victims, with 3.6 million youngsters going hungry. “If they continue to be prevented from providing aid in Sudan rapidly and at scale, a famine will likely take hold in large parts of the country,” said Mr. Laerke. “More people will flee to neighboring countries. Children will succumb to disease and malnutrition, and women and girls will face even greater suffering and dangers.” Over a year of war Sudan is in a desperate situation. According to calculations made by the United Nations, almost 10 million people who have been displaced from their homes are refugees inside the country. To make matters worse, a further two million people have fled for safety neighboring countries. Sudan has been witnessing brutal armed clashes between the Sudanese army and the RSF since April 15, 2023, with the two sides accusing each other of initiating the conflict. The United Nations has previously said the worsening situation is having a negative impact on neighboring countries, many of which are coping with their own crises. Thank you for reading our article.

    "text": "“Il lavoro sarà la nostra ossessione perché solo col lavoro si costruisce la dignità. L’anno appena passato è stato difficile. La nostra regione ha vissuto un’alluvione drammatica che ha colpito duramente famiglie e imprese. Noi restiamo concentrati provando con passione, dedizione e impegno a mettere in campo tutte le risorse disponibili per far ripartire l’economia e la vita. Lo stiamo facendo provando a seguire l’esempio di una grande toscano: Don Milani a cui abbiamo dedicato l’\nultima edizione della Festa della Toscana, che ci ha insegnato a sostenere chi soffre e chi è in difficoltà, a metterci a disposizione degli altri senza voltarsi dall’altra parte”.\nIl videomessaggio del presidente del Consiglio regionale Antonio Mazzeo, a nome di tutta l’Assemblea legislativa e pubblicato sui canali social istituzionali e sul sito\nwww.inconsiglio.it, è un “augurio a tutte le toscane e a tutti i toscani per un 2024 sereno, proiettato verso un futuro di occasioni e di opportunità”. “Abbiamo un obiettivo: offrire ad ogni cittadina e cittadino della nostra regione le stesse opportunità, indipendentemente dal luogo di nascita e residenza” dichiara il presidente che ricorda quanto fatto. “Il 2023 è stato l’anno in cui siamo riusciti a portare tante piccole e giovani imprese nella Silicon Valley, tante hanno avuto l’opportunità di conoscere nuovi mercati” afferma ricordando il progetto Casa Toscana.\n“La Toscana – prosegue il presidente – è una terra che non si volta mai dall’altra parte e il mio augurio per il 2024 è di non essere mai indifferenti, costruire nuove occasioni di crescita e sviluppo. Sono giorni di festa in cui tante donne e uomini ci permettono di offrire servizi sanitari evoluti, abbiamo un sistema di accoglienza e sicurezza tra i migliori in Italia, siamo una regione che non si ferma mai anche per i tanti volontari che ogni giorno lavorano sul nostro territorio”.\n“La Toscana – conclude Mazzeo - è terra di arte, cultura e bellezza ma anche terra di ingegno che pensa in grande perché solo anticipando il progresso e il cambiamento è possibile costruire un futuro migliore”.\nTutte le notizie di Toscana [<< Indietro](#)",

We will be flying into Athens, then taking a direct flight to Paros, then ferry to Antiparos for 4 nights. Ferry to Naxos for 5 nights, then ferry to Santorini for 3 nights and Athens for the last 2 night before flying back to Canada.\nThe crowds and cruise ships passenger overload has got me wondering if we should skip Santorini all together? We are staying at the Sunset Hotel which came highly recommended by this group with a beautiful view. But..if we have to fight crowds when we step out of our hotel to walk around the town I would not be enjoying this. Would someone recommend either staying away from the city centre instead, or skipping Santorini all together? IF so, where to stay for 3 nights instead?\nThanks for all of your help in my travel planning\nSantorini crowds too much and not worth it?\nWe are stopping in Santorini for 3 nights before we head to Athens as the last stop on our vacation.

Desde el 2005 en el Estadio Arthur Ashe , no teníamos a dos estadounidenses compitiendo frente a frente en una semifinal del US Open . Esta última vez se enfrentaron Andre Agassi contra Robby Ginepri en un partido que se llevó el 8 veces campeón de Grand Slams tras un encuentro bastante cerrado donde el marcador fue 6 -4, 5-7, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Más tarde, en la final de este torneo, Agassi terminó perdiendo el duelo final contra un Roger Federer que llegaba a defender su título y que inclusive pudo hacer 3 años seguidos más.\nTe puede interesar: ¿Quiénes son las nuevas promesas del Tenis y qué huecos tienen que llenar?\nRegresa la NFL con la Temporada 2024 ¿Quién es favorito? | Ritual El Podcast\n¿Cómo llegan los semifinalistas al encuentro? El californiano Taylor Fritz llega con una estadística brutal y es que solamente ha perdido 2 sets en todo el torneo, estos fueron en partidos diferentes por lo que en ninguno se ha encontrado cerca de estar fuera.\nPor otro lado, el nacido en Hyattsville, Maryland, Frances Tiafoe, ha perdido 5 sets a través de la competencia, pero se respalda con el hecho de que ha vencido a dos jugadores mejores posicionados que el en el Ranking ATP como lo fueron Ben Shelton con el puesto 13 en tercera ronda, y Grigor Dimitrov que se encuentra en el top 9 en cuartos de final.\nDe igual manera, hay que tomar en cuenta que Tiafoe ya conoce lo que es jugar unas semifinales del US Open mientras que su rival no cuenta con ese historial, sin embargo, hablando de enfrentamientos pasados entre los dos, Fritz cuenta con 6 victorias contra 1 de Frances .\nTe puede interesar: La FIFA anuncia cuál será el logo y la canción oficial para el Mundial\nEntrevista exclusiva con Guillermo Martínez | Selección Azteca\nUS Open ¡Noticias deportivas de hoy, sigue a TV Azteca Deportes en Google News!",
