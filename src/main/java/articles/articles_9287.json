    "text": "“Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?” (Luke 14:27-28 ESV)\nWhen I said, “I do,” to Jesus, I didn’t understand just how much it was going to cost. Salvation was a free gift, they said. And it was true. Jesus came and set my sorry soul free then made a new creation out of me—by grace alone—but there was a cost. In fact, it turned out to be more than I was willing to pay.\nYou see, I thought I could have salvation and be comfortable, too. I thought I could tell God He was in charge but then still hold onto veto power in certain situations. I never once would have told you these things, but I believed them far down in the depths of my deceitful heart.\nThe truth was, I came to faith with a misunderstanding of the covenant—a permanent, irrevocable agreement—I was making with God through Christ. What He had was going to be mine, and what I had was going to be His, and as surely as I could call on Him for every need, He could call on me to let go of anything and everything.\nSo it began, the long road of loss on the way to the greatest imaginable gain. I had to learn to count like Paul, as he said, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. (Philippians 3:8) Jesus began to call me away from my idols, the things that I counted as far more significant in actual practice than the one I claimed to love most.\nI remember having to “put to death” the things that I once most enjoyed, cutting them out of my life. That sounds harsh, but when something stands in the way of you and life itself—which is what Jesus is for us—the only right thing is to remove that thing from its improper place. Some of those things were inherently sinful, so they were easy enough to spot, but others were more subtle and have taken time to recognize and still today to defeat—like personal ambition.\nThe Word helped me on the journey—the Gospel of Matthew in particular. When Jesus was fulfilling His earthly ministry, various people thought to follow Him: And a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” And Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.” (Matthew 8:19-22)\nYou can see that the scribe thought he was going to continue to be comfortable following Jesus, but we’re called to go wherever our Lord goes, and comfort isn’t part of the decision process. Then a disciple thought they were going to be able to follow Jesus when it was convenient , but when Jesus calls, only absolute obedience is appropriate. This is the King of kings, and He deserves our immediate and unquestioned submission.\nSo God guided me, helping me take steps out of my comfort zone onto the restless waves—and urging me to do hard things at inconvenient times—because He is out there in the unknown and the difficulty. He gently disciplines and purifies me now, day by day, transforming me from one degree of glory to another. I just have to be willing, open, and surrendered to the process of having my desires reshaped.\nI exist for Him now. Do you? Will you?\n~\nScripture is quoted from the ESV® Bible (The Holy Bible, English Standard Version®). ESV® Text Edition: 2016.

    "text": "Is anyone having issues with specific bank cards? We have 3 stores, all set up with a Worldpay gateway and all with a processing account through first data. They are setup to go to different bank accounts and are all on their own EIN's. Two accounts have no issues, one account has 3 banks that constantly decline out of nowhere. This account was open for 2 years until a random time in May and this issue came about.\nTo hopefully rectify the issue, I set up new accounts through Worldpay and First Data. Once active, those accounts still decline the same cards.\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Worldpay and First Data have not been helpful. The most I've gotten is from Worldpay saying the AVS was declined which is address verification system. We enter credit card numbers, expiration, and cvv2. Online is the same but also requires billing zip. The cards declined whether they are swiped/keyed/entered online.\nI've been at it since May on this and I'm ready lose it\nThank you in advance\nTo hopefully rectify the issue, I set up new accounts through Worldpay and First Data.

    "text": "Audio relacionado En entrevista para MVS Noticias con Juan Manuel Jiménez, en ausencia de Manuel López San Martín, Sebastián Ramírez, presidente de Morena en la Ciudad de México, habló sobre el panorama electoral y político para 2024, así como de la candidata a la capital del país, Clara Brugada. \"Un 2023 con muchos éxitos para nuestro movimiento, esperamos que el 2024 sea mucho mejor. Vaticinamos la derrota de la corrupción, del partido del cártel inmobiliario, el conservadurismo le va a ir muy mal en la ciudad y creo que vamos a darle continuidad a la transformación, al cambio, tenemos una precandidata honesta a la Jefatura de Gobierno\", expresó. En la conversación el presidente de Morena en la CDMX destacó la labor que ha hecho el partido en los últimos meses de la mano de Mario Delgado, algo que se ve reflejado en las encuestas de preferencia. Te podría interesar \"Nos pusimos a trabajar, lanzamos una campaña de credencialización muy intensa, más de 230 mil personas sacaron su credencial de Morena, abrimos casas del movimiento, hicimos dos giras, conformamos comités, sacamos adelante el proceso interno. Fue un año muy movido, nos hemos mantenido en la unidad, nos hemos mantenido en la calle, algo que ayuda a que el movimiento esté posicionado\", detalló. Respecto a Santiago Taboada, el contrincante de Clara Brugada a la Jefatura de Gobierno de la Ciudad de México, no tuvo reparo en comentar lo siguiente: Te podría interesar \"Es muy difícil es una persona que está muy cuestionada, tiene muchos temas en cuanto a su patrimonio que aclarar, viene de un grupo muy corrupto. Nosotros no nos podemos confiar, son un grupo muy cuestionado, rodeado de mucha corrupción\". Para terminar, Sebastián Ramírez habló de las coaliciones que se forman en la CDMX en apoyo a Clara Brugada, quien se mantiene en las encuestas 20 puntos arriba de sus contrincantes. \"Se termina de consolidar la coalición \"Juntos seguiremos haciendo historia\" en la Ciudad de México y lo más importante es seguir sumando a la ciudadanía, con organizaciones sociales, con ciudadanos de a pie para un contundente triunfo de Clara Brugada\" , concluyó.",

    "text": "School strikers on the picket line in Hackney, east London\nA fight over work conditions is unfolding at All Saints Catholic High School in Hackney, east London.\nNEU union members struck on Thursday and are set to strike on Friday because bosses are demanding they cover for other teachers.\nUnder national terms and conditions, this should only happen in “unforeseeable circumstances”. “But now management is getting teachers to cover in circumstances that were totally foreseeable,” NEU joint branch secretary Dave Davies told Socialist Worker.\n“And management has been asking teaching assistants and support workers to cover teachers instead.”\nHe added that “management has refused to make any substantial changes”. It made an offer on cover, but workers rejected it as it simply shifted the burden on support workers.\nOne NEU member told Socialist Worker management has been “unfair” and workers feel that they are “not being listened to”. She said that negotiations haven’t gone anywhere and management has spoken rudely to the strikers.\nManagement has treated the NEU rep “with a lack of respect,” she added. “Before that it was just a workplace disagreement, but after that I am angry.”\nElizabeth, who works at the school, argued that management is making these decisions as cost-saving measures after “government underfunding for years”. “And it isn’t a secret that we have a falling number of student enrolments .”\nWith the current funding formula, central government money is allocated to schools according to the number of students they have. But the housing crisis is pushing working class people out of inner London boroughs.\nElizabeth argued that Labour “need to fund schools properly so we don’t have to end up doing double role”. “We have been bled dry for so many years,” she said.\nWe are working harder but our pay doesn’t reflect that. While bankers get huge bonuses, we don’t get any extra payments.\nElizabeth is a single mum of two girls and has been forced to use bank loans to pay her bills. She argued that the cost of living crisis has added to the difficulties schools are having at retaining teachers.\n“We are working harder but our pay doesn’t reflect that. While bankers get huge bonuses, we don’t get any extra payments.\n“All of the Saturday work I do, I don’t get paid for that. If the money doesn’t allow us to meet our basic needs, then it is no surprise that teachers are leaving the profession.\n“When is that going to change? It is about time the government puts schools first.”\nAnother striker said that they were on the picket line to support their co-workers. “It was a majority decision and I abide by that as a union member,” he said.\nHe thought that the way the headteacher has implemented policies “is completely wrong”. “He has used a sledge hammer instead of a silk glove,” the striker said. “No management can run anywhere without the good will of its workers. All goodwill is gone.”\nYou have young teachers who can’t afford to stay in teaching.\nOne NEU member said the higher workload would harm “the welfare of students and workers” and said they were “disappointed and frustrated with management.”\nOn the picket line, strikers discussed the NEU’s national indicative ballot for industrial action over Labour’s 2.8 pay insult.\nOne person said Britain is “broken” and there being no money left to give to anyone anyway, while another argued the money is there but in the wrong hands.\nAnother striker said, “There’s a disparity of pay structures, for example headteachers being paid £100,000 or £150,000 plus.\n“You have young teachers who can’t afford to stay in teaching.” The strikers pointed out that some “headteachers get paid more than prime ministers”.\nThe strike in Hackney is part of a wave of school walkouts that began last month. They have shown how action builds workers’ confidence to fight—and can build momentum for national action too.",
