The only thing you can expect to dig into this time of year is the snow blanketing your driveway. But if you’re searching for a yearlong resolution to stick to in 2024, tilling the earth as part of a community garden would be a holistic option, according to new science from [Jill Litt](https://www.colorado.edu/envs/jill-litt), a professor of environmental health at the University of Colorado Boulder. Published in the [Lancet Planetary Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00303-5/fulltext) last year, Litt’s research looked at beginner gardeners who tended one of the nonprofit [Denver Urban Gardens](https://dug.org/)’ (DUG) plots for a year. She found that they ate more fiber and were more active than study participants who did not take up gardening—results that you might expect. But those who gardened also experienced a greater decline in perceived stress and anxiety, differences Litt and DUG executive director Linda Appel Lipsius chalk up to time spent outdoors, added physical activity, and, in particular, the community in community gardening. That could mean socializing with fellow gardeners, participating in a group workday, or simply committing to a cause. “[Community gardening] is a way to come together on a continued basis where people are depending on you,” Appel Lipsius says. “A basic human need is to be needed.” And there is no shortage of gardens in Denver that need tending. This spring, DUG will open its 200th site, in Northwest Denver on land abutting I-70. In addition to plots, the garden will feature trees and bushes planted around the perimeter to provide a sound barrier between nearby houses and I-70 traffic while also producing nuts and fruit for the neighborhood, including sour cherries that the area’s Ukrainian and Russian residents specifically asked for. Says Appel Lipsius: “It’s just a nice way to add further connection.”",

    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, Dec 29, 2023 / 16:10 pm Christmas is a time of reconciliation. God himself chose to become a man, coming into the world to save fallen humanity and reconcile it with himself. Christmas represents a dramatic break with conventional patterns and changes paradigms. Such is also the case of Zubair Simonson, a former Muslim who converted to Catholicism and shared his story recently with the [National Catholic Register](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/simonson-gaza-and-israel-and-peace), CNA’s sister news partner. “Hatred consumes. The loathing of a perceived enemy can be so consuming that one would rather see that enemy harmed than see a so-called ‘friend’ be saved,” Simonson noted, recalling his childhood, deeply affected by an upbringing that taught him to viscerally hate the Jews. Simonson grew up in the United States, a long way from the Holy Land. However, from a very young age he was introduced to a narrative of “oppressors” and “oppressed,” of a people who were entirely to blame and a people who never did anything reprehensible. “I’d heard it reinforced, time and again, at the mosque. I’d heard it reinforced, time and again, in the homes of family and friends,” he recalled.",

    "text": "Uncomfortable weather is showing no sign of letting up for a Sydney to Hobart fleet already battered by squally conditions that have damaged yachts and broken ribs.\nMore than 70 boats remained at sea late on Friday afternoon, with the day's first finisher not arriving until 1pm (AEDT) - some 29 hours after LawConnect claimed line honours victory.\nTasmanian yacht Alive, which finished on Thursday, is primed to take out overall honours for a second occasion with a time that appears unbeatable.\nOfficial confirmation is likely to occur on Saturday.\nNo Limit and 12-year-old luxury cruiser Whisper were among a handful of yachts to make it to the safety of Hobart's Constitution Dock on Friday afternoon.\n\"Tough ... wet, lumpy, plenty of wind. But the team did an amazing job,\" No Limit skipper David Gotze said after his seventh-place finish across the line.\n\"We did the best with what we could do in the circumstances.\"\nThe retirement tally stands at 16 from 103 starters following a stormy Boxing Day night at sea.\nA strong wind warning is in place for waters off Tasmania's east coast, where a chunk of the fleet is tracking south.\nCruising Yacht Club of Australia commodore Arthur Lane said winds of 35 knots and 4.5-metre seas were expected on Friday afternoon and night.\n\"It is certainly slower than the last few years and that is because of the wind. It is an uphill race,\" he told AAP.\n\"It's going to be a very uncomfortable night.\"\nNSW entrant Salt Lines, veteran of 22 Sydney to Hobart races, and 52-footer Gunshot pulled the pin on Thursday night because of damage to their sails.\nRobbie Fisher, skipper of 66-footer Helsal 3, reported a broken mainsail rope, torn sail and \"other little things\".\n\"We have a minor injury to a crew ... our navigator was on deck, slipped, and cracked a couple of ribs,\" he said.\n\"We copped a beating across (Bass) Strait. We had over 30 knots and it was pretty bad. We have persevered though.\"\nHong Kong entrant Antipodes, crewed by Lindsay May in his 50th race, was slated to finish at some point on Friday.\n\"We've had some down time ... with breeze holes that our competitors didn't get,\" crew member Brad Kellett said.\n\"We've got a tear in the new mainsail to repair. We blew out our J2 headsail.\"\nThe Darren Hine-skippered Alive, overall winner in 2018, finished as clubhouse leader on handicap time.\nThe overall winner, which is awarded the Tattersall Cup, is judged on handicap which takes into account factors including the size of the boat.\nLawConnect won line honours on Thursday morning, coming from behind to beat fellow 100-footer and 2022 winner Andoo Comanche by just 51 seconds in the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history.\n ",

While rookie safety Jordan Howden (illness) returned to practice after resting on Wednesday, starting right tackle Ryan Ramczyk (knee) and veteran safety Lonnie Johnson (knee) were still missing. It isn’t looking good for either of them as we approach Sunday’s matchup with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who could be without top defenders Carlton Davis (concussion) and Shaquil Barrett (groin).\nIf there’s a silver lining, it’s that several young draft picks are practicing on a limited basis for the Saints after having missed some time with injuries. Rookies Isaiah Foskey (quadricep) and Kendre Miller (ankle) have both been active this week, and defensive end Payton Turner (toe) is progressing well in his return from injured reserve. Win or lose, it would be great to see something positive from the three of them down the stretch.\nHere’s a quick look at Thursday’s injury report from both teams:\nArticles Ryan Ramczyk weighing options with career-threatening injury NFL Week 17 best bets: One wager to make for every team Will your local TV station carry Week 17's Saints-Buccaneers game?

The pope returned the gesture by giving the center a painting of the Virgin and Child.\nIn addition, Francisco was able to meet the only child who lives in the center, named Jairo, whom he caressed and gave an Easter egg.\nThe Rebibbia women’s prison, on the Roman outskirts, is the largest of the four exclusively women’s prisons in Italy and currently houses 360 inmates and one child, of various nationalities and many arriving from marginalized contexts.\nFrancisco arrived at this institution around 4:00 p.m. local time (3:00 p.m. GMT) in a wheelchair and was welcomed by dozens of women, prisoners, social workers, nuns and police officers, who applauded him and They kissed his hands as they passed.\nIn this way, the pope, despite his recent health problems, continues a tradition that began with his pontificate in 2013, that of not celebrating Holy Thursday in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome but in the places of suffering of modern society.\nIn his eleven years of teaching he has celebrated the ‘In Coena Domini’ mass generally in prisons, although he has also done it in shelters for refugees, in juvenile correctional facilities or in residences, with the sick.\nThis morning The Argentine pontiff opened the rites of the Easter Triduum of Holy Week in St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican with the Chrism Mass, which commemorates the institution of the sacrament of priestly orders.\nFrancis has begun the Easter rites with complete normality despite the concern caused by his refusal to read in public and this Good Friday he is expected to celebrate the passion of the Lord and go, as is tradition, to the Roman Colosseum for a Stations of the Cross that, for the first time, will feature meditations written by him himself.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina from 1901-2000 was 41.7. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Mecklenburg County, North Carolina experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina history.",

Police had taped off the street for two blocks near the courthouse, the parking lot and First National Bank during the investigation at the scene. Market Street remained open.\nThursday marked the first day of an attempted homicide trial at the courthouse. District Attorney Michael O'Donnell said the trial, which was linked to a 2022 fatal shooting in the city, has been postponed.\nO'Donnell said the attempted homicide trial of Anthony Moultrie and Franky Riche that began Thursday has been ruled a mistrial as a result of Thursday's shooting. Both are accused of attempted homicide stemming from an incident that took place in May 2022 related to a homicide that occurred a month earlier.\nThursday's shooting happened moments after the trial broke for lunch. The courthouse is on lockdown and will be closed for the remainder of the day according to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.\nA crowd at the scene before the ambulance left for the hospital, gathered in prayer as police and EMTs responded to the scene.\nThis is a developing story. More details will be published when they become available.\nTags Legal Action Criminal Law Law Enforcement Crime Gun Violence Emergency Services Criminal Justice Mass Shootings Law Enforcement Controversies Filmed Deaths Violence Homicide Crimes Murder National Security Of The United States Killings Death National Security Public Services Of The United States Lockdown Law-related Events Misconduct Trial Attacks In Trending Video Featured Local Savings COUPON DEALS NEWSPAPER ADS Trending Recipes",
