    "text": "CATALDO, Idaho — A North Idaho woman who has been missing for the past few days has been found, according to the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office (KCSO). KCSO said a man found Linda Kent on his ranch on South Tamarack Ridge Road in Cataldo Thursday night. According to KCSO, the ranch is several miles away from her last known location, which was a boat launch near Cataldo. KCSO also said the ranch is in the general Cataldo area. KCSO said Kent was taken to the hospital to be treated for dehydration and was reunited with her family. The sheriff's office called off the search for Kent on Tuesday, saying the search ended after search and rescue \"exhausted all resources.\" Lieutenant Zachary Sifford told KREM 2 News earlier this week marine units, canines, and a helicopter were used without picking up a sign of Kent. \"Thank you to all of the citizens who called in with information regarding this case,\" KCSO said in a press release Thursday evening.

    "text": "Rick Slayman, the world’s [first living recipient of a genetically edited pig kidney transplant](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/pig-kidney-transplant-living-person/index.html), was discharged from the hospital Wednesday, two weeks after his operation, Massachusetts General Hospital said in a statement. “He is recovering well and will continue to recuperate at home with his family,” the hospital [said](https://twitter.com/MassGeneralNews/status/1775621590182457769) on X, formerly Twitter. In a [statement](https://www.massgeneral.org/news/rick-slayman-discharge-statement) issued by the hospital, Slayman said, “This moment — leaving the hospital today with one of the cleanest bills of health I’ve had in a long time — is one I wished would come for many years. Now, it’s a reality and one of the happiest moments of my life.” Slayman, a 62-year-old manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, had previously said his doctors suggested that he try a pig kidney when he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. People are also reading… His doctors said last month that they thought Slayman’s new kidney could last years but also acknowledged that there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. His surgery is the third such xenotransplant of a pig organ into a living human. The first two transplants were hearts transplanted into living patients that had run out of other transplant options. The organs were transplanted under special rules that permit compassionate use of experimental therapies for patients in especially dire situations. Both patients died weeks after receiving their organs. Slayman said he was grateful for the response to his surgery, especially from other patients who are waiting for a kidney transplant. The need for organs far outstrips the number that are available. Every day 17 people die in the U.S. waiting for an organ. Kidneys are the organ in shortest supply. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waitlist for those organs. ”Today marks a new beginning not just for me, but for them, as well,” Slayman said in the statement. ___ More than 100,000 people are on the organ donor wait list—here's who has the longest and shortest wait times More than 100,000 people are on the organ donor wait list—here's who has the longest and shortest wait times Heart transplant Heart and lung transplant Intestine transplant Kidney and pancreas transplant Liver transplant",

In a viral video clip, Bhagyashree is heard opining that women who adhere to feminism have got it totally wrong. \"When you say that patriarchy has been going on for a long time and we want to rebel. So there have been these whole bra-burning women that go around and they say we will wear what we like, we’ll talk how we want. But how is that equality? How is it equality that you abuse, or wear less clothes, or misbehave or get drunk,\" she said. Bhagyashree also suggested that true femininity lies in being a nurturing, caregiving person. Bhagyashree was seen in Prabhas' Radhe Shyam in 2022. Her son Abhimanyu and daughter Avantika Dassani have also been working in movies.",
