( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nIn an Instagram post this morning, Surfing SA said Khai was \"very involved in our surfing community\", and had a \"passion for surfing stemming from a family with deep surfing roots in SA\".\n\"He was a happy, kind and respectful kid, very much loved by his surfing peers and he will be greatly missed out in our community and on the water,\" the post stated.\nA GoFundMe page set up by the boy's aunty to raise funeral costs states that the young surfer \"was suddenly taken from us by a white pointer while surfing\".\nYoung surfer Khai Cowley was fatally attacked by a shark off the South Australian coast. ( Facebook )\nTributes to the teenager have also been posted more widely on social media.\n\"Fly high … some of my most memorable surfs were with you,\" one post read.\nA junior surf club to which Khai Cowley belonged shared a tribute to the young victim.\n\"It is with immense sadness that Microgroms Junior Surf Club remember Khai after his devastating passing,\" it said.\n\"Khai was a member since 2016 and will be remembered as a good friend and talented surfer who was well respected and admired by all that knew him.\"\nA fatal shark attack took place near Ethel Beach on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula on Thursday afternoon. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nMarty Goody, a surfer and resident of Stansbury on Yorke Peninsula, said he understood the teenager was surfing with family at the time of the attack.\n\"It's a very small surfing community on the Yorke Peninsula and everyone knows each other, so I was just checking to see if it was anyone I knew,\" he said.\n\"That's when I found out it was that 15-year-old lad and his dad, so it would have been terrible.\"\nSA Police responded to reports a person had been \"seriously injured\" around 1:30pm, later confirming the body of a teenage boy was recovered from the water.\nAuthorities said Yorke Mid North Police, detectives and crime scene investigators attended the scene and a report is now being prepared for the coroner.\nEthel Beach is located at Dhilba Guuranda-Innes National Park, a location popular with tourists, fishers and surfers.\nMarion Bay Ocean Safari owner Ryan Valente told ABC Radio Adelaide the town was in shock.\n\"It's the stuff nightmares are made of,\" he said.\n\"I've got some friends in the area who've been here since day dot, and talking to them, not even in their memory can they remember anything close to an event like this.\"\nNearby resident and surfer Luke Sykora said the incident was \"tragic\".\n\"I have seen a fair few sharks here over 22 years, but that is the first fatal attack that we've had down here,\" he said.\n\"I wouldn't wish it upon anyone … to even be at the same beach at the same time.\"\nThe attack is the latest of several in South Australia this year.\nA 15-year-old boy killed in a shark attack in South Australia is being remembered as a \"talented and dearly loved\" member of the surfing community. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nDeputy Premier Susan Close described Mr Cowley's death as a \"tragedy\".\nShe said the State Government was not considering introducing shark deterrents, despite the state recording three shark attack fatalities this year.\n\"There are policy interventions that are used interstate, such as attempts to deflect sharks from particular areas whether through nets or through noises,\" she said.\n\"That tends to work if you've got a very intense population area and that's not the case for South Australia.\n\"We've got this long coastline and these attacks have occurred at pretty far-flung places.\"\nThe shark attack at Ethel Beach follows several others in South Australian waters over recent months. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nIn May, 46-year-old surfer Simon Baccanello was fatally attacked at Walkers Rock Beach near Elliston on Eyre Peninsula.\nIn November another surfer, Tod Gendle, was killed further up the west coast near Streaky Bay.\nThe 55-year-old was knocked off his board by a shark while he was paddling into the water near Granites Beach .\nEnvironmental science honours student Bridgette O'Shannessy suffered serious injuries when she was bitten on the head near the jetty at Port Noarlunga.\nIn October, south-east woman Pam Cook was left with leg injuries when she was attacked by a shark while swimming near the jetty at Beachport.\nRodney Fox Shark Museum researcher Andrew Fox said the spate of attacks was \"quite a difference\" to previous years.\n\"These little clusters [of attacks] are more often seen in Western Australia and in the eastern states,\" he said.\nPosted 4h ago 4 hours ago Thu 28 Dec 2023 at 9:43pm , updated 56m ago 56 minutes ago Fri 29 Dec 2023 at 12:50am\nRelated Stories Teen killed in shark attack off coast of Yorke Peninsula in SA 'I fell straight into its mouth': Wing foiler bitten on leg by shark north of Perth relives encounter Me, the sea and the 'Jaws effect'.

    "text": "Israel ha dado aprobación preliminar a Chipre para el establecimiento de un corredor marítimo humanitario para el envío y entrega de ayuda humanitaria a Gaza, bajo rígido cerco israelí tras el inicio de la guerra con Hamás en octubre. Hace poco más de una semana, Israel anunció la pronta apertura del corredor, que deberá estar sujeto a inspección de seguridad y \"supervisión israelí\" en Chipre, antes de que se lleve a Gaza, dijo a EFE Lior Hayat, portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores de Israel. Según concretó, aún no hay una fecha clara para abrir esta vía, que implicaría la entrega de más ayuda humanitaria al enclave, inmerso en una dura crisis humanitaria por falta de agua, comida, recursos médicos o combustible debido al asedio israelí casi total tras el ataque de Hamás que hizo estallar la guerra el 7 de octubre. \"Hay una autorización básica para usar esta ruta, pero aún quedan algunos problemas logísticos que deben ser resueltos\", matizó Hayat. El Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU aprobó la semana pasada una resolución que pedía el envío de más ayuda humanitaria a la Franja y la designación de un coordinador para acelerar el proceso. Chipre, a unas de 210 millas náuticas de Gaza, se propuso como punto de partida del corredor humanitario para focalizar la entrega de ayuda humanitaria a Gaza desde la isla, y entre cuestiones que estarían por resolver está la seguridad de los barcos que vayan a Gaza, como también quién sería receptor de las ayudas. La semana pasada, en una visita oficial a Chipre, el ministro de Exteriores israelí, Eli Cohen, mostró su apoyo al corredor, que consideró como \"un paso importante\" para que Israel se desvincule de la situación económica de Gaza. \"La creación de un corredor marítimo a Gaza ayudará a la retirada económica de Israel de la Franja. No permitiremos un retorno a la realidad que precedió al asesino ataque terrorista\" de Hamás, dijo Cohen. Desde que comenzó la guerra, la ayuda humanitaria para el enclave ha entrado a cuentagotas, principalmente por el cruce de Rafah con Egipto, pero este diciembre Israel también permitió que algunos camiones entraran por Kerem Shalom, paso de mercancías entre Gaza y territorio israelí.
