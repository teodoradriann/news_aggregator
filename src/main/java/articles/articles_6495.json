    "text": "This might come as a surprise, but Subway is the largest restaurant chain in the world. Many people assume that places that sling burgers and fries are on top, but Subway occupies the most restaurant real estate globally. While the sandwich shop seems to dominate the market, it may be losing star power. According to Restaurant Busines s, Subway closed 600 locations in 2024. This is the first time in two decades that the chain has dipped under 20,000 locations in the United States. Per the FDD via Restaurant Business, Subway peaked in 2015 with 27,100 restaurants in the /us alone. Since 2015, Subway has closed 7,600 restaurants.\nSubway Closed Fewer Restaurants In 2024 Than Years Prior From 2015 to 2023, Subway closed about 950 locations a year. So, the news from 2024 isn’t all bad for the sandwich shop. Even with thousands of locations across the U.S., Starbucks is set to eclipse Subway as the most prolific chain in the country. As food prices rise and people continue to be more selective about how they spend their money, every business has to do its best to attract new customers. Subway is no different.\nThey frequently introduce new menu items to attract business. The newest addition is the Doritos Footlong Nachos.\n“we had to go with @Doritos Footlong Nachos cause triangle subs wouldn’t fit in the sandwich sleeve. limited time at participating restaurants,” Subway shared on Instagram .\nThis person loved them, “I could eat the Doritos footlong nachos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.”\n“You understood the assignment, and now we get to eat it,” this fan agreed.\nAfter hearing that many Subway locations are closed, this person thinks they know why. “I hear you guys are closing a bunch of stores, ngl, I stopped going when you guys made your new menu and got rid of the sourdough bread here in the Bay Area. Get it together.”\nThis story’s featured image is by Olga Nayashkova via Shutterstock.",

    "text": "Get ready for a ⁢trip to the depths of⁤ Hell and beyond! “Doom: The Dark Ages” is shaping ⁤up to be more than just a game for fans ⁢of the iconic franchise – itS ‍a pilgrimage into the raw⁣ origins⁢ of the slayer. This expansive prequel, ⁢set before the events of the 2016 reboot and​ its sequel, promises ‌a richer,⁢ more immersive experience for both veterans and newcomers alike.\n“It will be a celebration​ not only for Doom fans, but also for fans of shooting games in ​general,” shares an insider. “And since it will be a prequel to the last two installments of the ⁣series, it will also attract new players, becuase knowledge of the history is not necesary.”\nPrepare to ⁣traverse a vast, meticulously crafted world. From crumbling ​Gothic ruins whispering forgotten tales of the slayer’s ‍past, to the ⁣shadowy depths of ancient dungeons and the ‍infernal hellscapes, the game aims ⁣to transport players to the heart of the ⁣demonic conflict.This expansive,open world design encourages exploration,rewarding you with hidden ‌secrets,valuable​ resources,and the possibility to hone your ‍skills across a diverse range of‍ weapons‍ and abilities.\nGone are ⁤the days of linear level progression.‌ “Rather of immediately⁣ completing the mission objectives,we⁢ can focus on exploring the world and looking into nearby caves and dungeons filled with hordes of demons and simple field puzzles,” expresses the developer.\nThe story itself promises to be‍ a thrilling blockbuster,⁤ delving into the origins of the⁤ Slayer’s war against Hell. “Slayer will be imprisoned and⁢ the balance between good and evil will ⁤be‌ disturbed,” hinting⁢ at a dramatic narrative arc. This time, the developers have⁢ opted for a more cinematic approach, replacing static codex entries with‍ fully realized film inserts that bring the storyline ‌to life.\nA New Arsenal for the Slayer But the greatest surprise waits in the gameplay ⁣itself. A brand​ new weapon, ⁣the ⁤saw blade, promises a⁢ visceral and brutal combat experience.\n”It effectively works exactly as it sounds,” teases ⁤the ‍developer. “It looks a bit like a combination of‍ a disc and a chainsaw operated by a rope.⁢\nAnother intriguing addition is the shield, a versatile tool ​that goes beyond simple defense. “The shield has⁣ several functions – we can‍ block enemy attacks, throw it‍ to deal ​damage, activate various mechanisms, jump over cliffs ‍with it,​ but also, like in Souls, parry and ⁢deflect.\nDoom: The Dark Ages – Back to Brutality‍ Doom: The Dark Ages promises to be a return‌ to​ the series’ brutal roots, ditching the​ frenetic, aerial combat of its predecessor, Doom ​Eternal, for a more grounded, tank-like experience. The developers envision players as hulking Abrams tanks‍ in a world of demonic chaos. This change is reflected in the gameplay, where⁤ maps prioritize horizontal traversal ‍over verticality, and combat focuses on concentrated firepower rather than acrobatic maneuvers.​\n‌ “If you were an F22 fighter in Doom Eternal, this⁢ time we wanted you to feel like an Abrams tank,” say ⁤the game’s creators. ​ “it looks great in the wash and,interestingly,we​ can perform all these actions with the same button,as everything depends on ⁢the context⁢ and what is happening on ‍the battlefield,” ‍\nThe combat ‍system revolves around two key elements: a shield in the player’s left hand and a devastating weapon in the right. The ⁤combination is visually striking, with indicators on screen (blue and green) ⁣showcasing a⁤ dynamic interplay of defense and⁤ offense. ⁤\nHand-to-hand‍ combat is another crucial ​aspect, ‍allowing for the use of a variety⁤ of brutal implements like an iron fist, an electrifying glove, ⁣or a spiked ‍club. the team promises deep customization options and upgrades for ​these ⁢tools,ensuring a personalized and devastating melee ​experience.\nof course, no ⁣Doom game would be complete without the iconic glory kills.Players can once again rip and tear through their demonic foes with gruesome ⁢finishing moves. “There’s blood ​flowing⁢ here and guts flying nicely,” say ⁤the developers, ⁣promising a satisfyingly visceral ⁤experience for those familiar with the series’ penchant ‍for over-the-top violence.\nBeyond the close-quarters combat, the game ‍teases an extravagant arsenal of weapons, promising designs that blend the power of‍ modern weaponry with the grim aesthetic of ancient torture ⁣devices. ⁢ The developers are⁣ aiming for ‌a new level of demonic terror, boasting that they’ve created the ⁤largest and most⁤ terrifying enemies in the Doom franchise’s history.\nMusic aficionados ‍will also appreciate the contribution of the band “Finishing‍ Move,”‍ who are ⁣providing the soundtrack⁣ for‌ this symphony of destruction. the experience​ will ⁣be​ one⁢ of⁤ adrenaline-pumping rock rhythms overlaid on a backdrop of relentless demon slaying, culminating in a truly unforgettable experience.\nDoom: The Dark​ Ages – Prepare​ for a Brutal Return to the‌ Slayer’s ​Origins Get ready for⁢ a face-melting dose of chaotic carnage as “Doom: The Dark ‍Ages” descends upon us‍ on‍ May ‌15th. This upcoming installment in the iconic ‘Doom’ franchise promises a gritty, ⁤visceral experience that harkens back to the series’ roots, ‍emphasizing the raw power and brutality of the Doom ⁣Slayer. ​\nInstead of the high-octane, jet-like agility of “Doom Eternal,” “Doom: The Dark Ages” places‍ greater focus on the Slayer’s sheer, unrelenting‍ might, ⁤allowing players to feel like “an iron tank, ready to​ stand‌ and fight,”⁣ as described ⁣by ⁤the advancement team. ⁢expect devastating melee attacks and a return to ‌classic strafing mechanics, adding a layer of strategic⁢ depth to the frenetic combat.\nthe developers understand the⁣ importance of customization and player agency, offering a ​ wealth of options to tailor the difficulty to each individual player’s skill level. “Along with the standard options, we⁤ also have a lot of modifiers that determine the aggression and speed of enemies, the ⁢dynamics of the game, the damage dealt by us and ‌the ‍enemies, and even ​details such as the‍ length⁣ of the parry window or the ‌frequency of resources appearing on maps,”\nBut⁢ that’s not all. “doom: The Dark Ages”‍ promises a symphony ‌of bombastic set pieces, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the ‘Doom’ universe. Prepare to pilot a‍ colossal 100-meter-tall mech called Atlas, battling giant titans and pulverizing buildings with your bare fists. Imagine the epic spectacle of a kaiju fight,but with shotguns ⁢and cybernetic weaponry. and hold on tight for the mind-blowing sequences where you’ll ride atop a ‍fire-breathing dragon,​ unleashing havoc with a‌ futuristic ‌rifle.\n“Doom:⁢ The Dark ​Ages” ⁢might not reinvent the wheel, ⁣but it’s​ guaranteed to deliver a frenzied, ⁣unforgettable experience for fans of the series and newcomers alike. ‌Dive into a world of dark fantasy, demon guts, and headbanging metal as the Slayer returns to⁢ claim his rightful place as the⁢ ultimate champion of hell.",

    "text": "﻿\nWhile he may have been born a day too late to receive a visit from Santa Claus, baby Nathan Ameer Ramnath was greeted by another jolly grey-haired man, Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh, at the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH).\nBorn shortly after 1 am on December 26 to first-time mother Zenefir Deodial, 22, Ramnath was also the first baby to be born in the country on Boxing Day. It’s why he received a visit, and gift, from the minister as he upheld a long-standing tradition. The Health Minister traditionally pays a visit to newborns on Christmas, Boxing and New Year’s Day at their respective hospitals.\nDeodial said she was expecting to deliver at the end of the month, but her waters broke on Christmas morning.\n“Everybody thought he was coming yesterday but he said nah, he would keep up until today.”\nShe said her experience at the hospital was good, but the pain of labour was “not so good.”\nHowever, a day after lamenting the country’s declining fertility rate, Deyalsingh appeared to make a jesting effort to combat that by telling Deodial: “They say it gets easier after the second and third one and then the fourth one and then the fifth one. So by five, it’s no pain.”\nTo the minister’s joke, she quipped: “Mommy said the same thing, but I said, ‘Like long time they didn’t have TV.'”\nSophia Sinanan was the second baby born on Christmas Day at the San Fernando General Hospital, to Beverly Beharry. They, too, received a visit from Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh. – Photo by Grevic Alvarado Deyalsingh also visited baby Sophia Sinanan and her mother Beverly Beharry, 23, along with baby Elisha Huggins and his mother Kerdisha Duntin. Both babies were born on Christmas Day at SFGH. He was unable to visit them on Wednesday, as he was visiting babies at the Port of Spain General Hospital and the Mt Hope Women’s Hospital.\nHere he said the country’s fertility rate continued to decline, going from 1.2 in 2023 to 0.9 in 2024. He said the replacement rate to keep the population steady is 2.1.\nDeyalsingh was unable to say how many babies were born across the country for Christmas and Boxing Day.",

    "title": "The Love Boat gave Bernie Kopell an unexpected romantic image",
    "text": "The Love Boat gave Bernie Kopell an unexpected romantic image He was the underdog of romance until he became the type everyone wanted. There are many ways to succeed in Hollywood. Sometimes it helps to know someone in the industry; other times, it takes a whole lot of luck and a bunch of persistence. The usual route to becoming a Hollywood star in the '70s went like this: Get lucky and get a part as the leading man or woman in a TV series, then transition to character work as you get older. Not The Love Boat's Bernie Kopell, though. His story was a bit different. Kopell started his career as a character actor in the '50s, where he would remain a character actor until The Love Boat came along and made Kopell into a leading man. Those series of events are typically reversed, but there Kopell was, sex appeal at 47. While referring to his Hollywood glow-up and newfound romantic image, Kopell said: \"I've never known an evolution like this.\" Kopell played the role of Doctor Adam Bricker, who was the doctor on the ABC series. Since the series premiere in 1977, Kopell would have many romantic encounters aboard the ship – something he was not used to before. \"I attribute my casting, on the one hand, to taking care of myself,\" Kopell said in a 1979 interview with The Ottawa Citizen. \"But on the other level, which is probably more interesting in the universal sense of show business, the standards have dropped for leading men.\" Kopell said a new type of leading man had started getting air-time. For Kopell, these men included: Richard Dreyfuss, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Gene Wilder. \"I think the world of our business has become more realistic,\" Kopell said. \"We don't just do fantasy trips about beautiful people, like Tyrone Power or Clark Gable. There's a realization that everyone, no matter what he looks like, is capable of romance.\" Romance, of course, is what made The Love Boat float. There was romance everywhere; Under the stars, in the water, among the crew and guests. The Pacific Princess would be a terrible place to be right after a breakup. Kopell said part of The Love Boat's appeal was that the series provided an escape for people who needed a break from the pollution in cities, breakups, inflation and politics. The other part of the appeal? Average-looking people who are caught up in multiple romances. \"People who enjoy the show the most are those who've never been on a cruise and never will go on a cruise,\" Kopell said. \"This ship takes you away from your problems.\" Kopell not only acted out the romance onscreen, but he and Fred Grandy (Gopher) had also written a few segments for the series. He said he and his character had a few parallels, and he attributes his success to his professionalism. \"The age of the rugged individual is over,\" Kopell said. \"Show business is now a computer business and time is money... The point that I am making is that they don't put up with any nonsense. This is an age of professionalism.\" [Watch The Love Boat on MeTV!](/shows/the-love-boat) Sundays at 4 PM*available in most MeTV markets [Love Boat - Shake 'Em Up ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-shame-em-up?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatshameemup) [Love Boat - Wave of Romance ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-wave-of-romance-1?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatwaveofromance1) [Love Boat - Dig the Uniform ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-dig-the-uniform?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatdigtheuniform) [Love Boat - Exciting and New ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-exciting-and-new?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatexcitingandnew) [Love Boat - Doctor Love ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-doctor-love?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatdoctorlove) [Love Boat - Here to Serve ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-here-to-serve?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatheretoserve) [Love Boat - Isaac ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-isaac?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatisaac) [Love Boat - The Doctor is In ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-the-doctor-is-in?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatthedoctorisin) [Love Boat - Romance Ahoy ](https://metvmall.com/products/love-boat-romance-ahoy?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=loveboatromanceahoy) 15 Comments [Newest](#!)| [Oldest](#!)| [Top Comments](#!)",

    "title": "Warriors great Larry Smith, Dub Nation’s first crush, was quiet laborer – NBC Sports Bay Area & California",
    "text": "Warriors Feature Warriors great Larry Smith, Dub Nation's first crush, was quiet laborer By Monte Poole • Published 43 mins ago • Updated 42 mins ago Share NBC Universal, Inc. He was drafted by the Warriors, signed his first NBA contract with the franchise, came to Oakland and became one of the most beloved players in the history of Bay Area professional sports.\nThe Warriors always have had a passionate fan base, but it’s exponentially larger in 2024 than it was in 1980. Though today it’s rare to walk a block without seeing a glut of team gear, there was a time when the franchise was the neglected stepchild of local sports.\nBut Larry Smith forged a connection without trying. Arriving in California from the deep south, he was allergic to fawning adulation, diligently avoided spotlights and made no attempt to kiss babies. He was the Kevon Looney of Warriors teams that were, at best, mediocre.\nStay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter. Smith’s physique told you he had a job to do and his baleful face – which belied his mild demeanor – suggested he was staying until finished. The 6-foot-8, 215-pound power forward would stroll onto the floor with a double mission. He would chase rebounds as if they were babies falling from the sky and play defense as if paid per stop.\nThis, for sports fans in 1980s Oakland, was love language.\n“The whole time after I got there, I felt welcome,” Smith says now. “Coming from a small town to a major city, I was embraced. They embraced me with open arms. That’s a feeling I’ll always, always cherish. They made me feel wanted.\n“Maybe they liked my quietness. But I know I loved those fans. One thing I always tried to do was make time for the kids. For the fans. No matter what else was going down, I tried to always make time for them. I mean, they were the people who were going to support me and the team.”\nGolden State Warriors\nDraymond Green 20 hours ago How Draymond's return could impact Kuminga, Warriors' rotations Breaking News 24 hours ago Draymond reinstated by NBA following 12-game suspension Smith, 65, is scheduled to be introduced at Chase Center on Sunday, the latest retired ex-Warrior to appear courtesy of the team’s “Alumni Nights” program. Not all of Dub Nation is familiar with him, but longtime fans revered him for his grit and toughness.\nSmith might be the first Warrior to enter the Oakland Coliseum Arena, which later became Oracle Arena, and know there would be a section of fans filling several rows in the upper reaches simply to rejoice in his labor.\nThey wore white hard hats because that was befitting of Smith, and they would respond to his hustle plays by dancing to The Champs’ classic “Tequila.”\nSmith spent his first nine NBA seasons with the Warriors and took only a few jump shots; they loved him anyway. He rarely dunked; they didn’t care. His relentless work ethic led to production, and that’s what they came to see.\n“I knew that in order to be a good player, I had to work hard and compete,” Smith says. “We had scorers. How can I make a difference? How can I get on the floor? I had to do what was necessary to get playing time. I had to get on the boards, play defense and do the little things that might not show on the scoreboard.”\nSmith was teammates with such big personalities as World B. Free and Micheal Ray Richardson. He toiled alongside such scorers as Chris Mullin and Bernard King and Purvis Short and Sleepy Floyd. Smith, the 24th overall pick in 1980, played next to center Joe Barry Carroll, who Golden State selected No. 1 overall in the same draft.\nOnly Mullin among them played more games with the franchise than Smith’s 617.\n“We had all these scorers, so I had to find my niche,” Smith says. “And my niche was trying to get on the glass and play defense. That’s what kept me on the floor and in the league.”\nWhile Mullin’s scoring opened the door to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Smith never got close. While Floyd’s 29-point fourth quarter in a playoff win over the Lakers in 1987 rightfully raised his profile and remains a postseason record, Smith’s performance in that series is overlooked.\nSmith averaged 13.8 points (54.5-percent shooting from the field) and 15.6 rebounds per game – numbers appreciably superior to Los Angeles power forward A.C. Green.\nYet it was George Karl, upon becoming head coach in 1986, who wanted to phase out the low-scoring Smith despite his excellence in areas where his teammates struggled. The Warriors drafted a talented Chris Washburn No. 3 overall to be their next power forward. Troubled by substance abuse, he played a total of 43 games with Golden State.\nSmith as a Warrior averaged 6.7 points and 10.4 rebounds. He was named All-Rookie first team in 1980-81 and five times finished among the league’s top-10 rebounders. His offensive rebounding percentage, 15.8, ranks fourth on the career list – behind Moses Malone, Andre Drummond and Rodman.\nMalone and Rodman are in the Hall of Fame. Drummond is a four-time rebounding champion. They all have keepsakes that honor their work.\nSmith has a keepsake, too. It sits on the mantle in his home. A hard hat adorned with “about 25” signatures from the folks.\n“I look at it every single day,” Smith says. “Sometimes, I get teary-eyed when I look at it. Those were some of the greatest days in my NBA career, my time in Oakland.”\nDownload and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast\nThis article tagged under: Warriors Feature Share MOST POPULAR Sponsored Reacting to Rich Paul's comments on Steph, LeBron and the 2020 NBA championship Promoted By Giants-Dubs Talk Sam Darnold Darnold could earn big contract incentive with 49ers' win vs. Rams Trent Williams 49ers-Rams inactives: Williams, Brendel questionable with illness Jonathan Kuminga Report: Warriors ‘loathe' idea of Kuminga trade amid Siakam rumors Keegan Murray Report: Kings won't trade Keegan, reluctant to pay Siakam max contract Latest Podcasts Analyzing Kuminga’s evolution, GP2’s injury and Klay’s mentality moving forward Warriors’ trade possibilities, championship potential with Marc Stein SEE MORE",
