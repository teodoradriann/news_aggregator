    "text": "The northern lights put on a show across Nova Scotia Thursday evening, as vibrant reds, greens and purples danced across the night sky.\nDartmouth resident Shauna Selig decided to drive to Martinique Beach, N.S., for her shot at seeing the lights — a bucket-list item she never thought she'd be able to cross off at home.\nAs she stood on the province's longest sandy beach, nestled on the picturesque Eastern Shore, she said one word came to mind — \"spectacular.\"\n\"My friend told me to turn around at one point as it was really lighting up and I was in awe,\" said the 47-year-old woman.\n\"You see photos from all over the world but seeing them yourself is a totally different experience.\"\nWATCH | What causes vibrant reds, greens and purples to dance across the sky?\nWhat causes vibrant reds, greens and purples to dance across the sky?\n1 hour ago Duration 2:17 The northern lights put on a show across the province on Thursday overnight into Friday. CBC meteorologist Ryan Snoddon explains how the auroras form. The U.S.-based NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center was forecasting a KP index between 7.3 and 8.3 Thursday evening into Friday morning, according to CBC meteorologist Ryan Snoddon.\nThe KP index ranges from zero to nine and describes the disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field caused by the solar wind. Simply put: the faster the wind blows, the greater the turbulence — and the greater the chance for the aurora borealis to be viewable, he said.\nThe northern lights as seen from White Point Beach Resort in Hunts Point, N.S. (Jennifer Sutherland) If you missed Thursday's event, there's a small chance for Round 2 on Friday evening.\nAccording to the space weather prediction organization, with the latest solar storm now easing, the solar activity won't be as strong or as visible in our skies on Friday night, said Snoddon.\nThat said, the organization is forecasting an index in the mid-range Friday evening and overnight, which means there is still a low chance the auroras may be visible here, he said.\nThe Space Weather Prediction Center is forecasting a KP Index near 5 Friday evening and overnight. (Ryan Snoddon/CBC) If viewable, the lights would be most likely to appear lower in the northern sky near the horizon, said Snoddon.\nHe said the weather forecast looks favourable, with mostly clear to partly cloudy skies across most of the mainland, with more dominant clouds across the Northumberland Shore and Cape Breton.\nWhile many of the photos on social media feeds are indeed dazzling, it's important to note that the northern lights appear more clearly on smartphones than they do to the naked eye.\nExperts have said that's because your phone is collecting light for a longer period of time than your eyes do .\nThe northern lights as seen from Hammonds Plains, N.S.
