    "text": "今年以来，小金属市场迎来显著上涨行情，锑、铋、钴等品种价格涨幅尤为突出，其中锑价近日连创历史新高。小金属的涨价潮也带动了相关股票的大涨，华钰矿业、宜安科技今年以来均涨逾80%，走势远超大盘。\n在供需偏紧的情况下，锑价、钴价中枢仍有望进一步上移，小金属价格弹性可期，战略小金属有望迎来价值重估。长江有色金属网数据显示，以3月12日最新报价计算，今年以来，锑价累计上涨约90%，近日连创历史新高；铋价累计上涨超80%至七年高位；钴价累计上涨超60%。镍、锶等小金属也频频涨价。\n不断上涨的小金属价格离不开消息面因素的影响。商务部和海关总署决定对部分锑、超硬材料相关物项实施出口管制，自2024年9月15日起正式实施。此外，商务部原则上不予许可镓、锗、锑、超硬材料相关两用物项对美国出口。工信部发布《稀土开采和稀土冶炼分离总量调控管理办法》与《稀土产品信息追溯管理办法》的征求意见稿。刚果（金）战略矿产市场监管局决定对地区内所有采矿活动产出的钴实施为时四个月的临时出口禁令。\n中金公司有色金属行业首席分析师齐丁表示，极地黄金2025年锑供应或将大幅收缩，进一步加剧供应紧张态势。平安期货指出，近期有色金属价格整体呈现震荡上行的走势，除小金属自身的供需因素外，宏观层面的利好也为行业发展提供了强劲支撑。从国际环境来看，美国2月ADP就业人数变动远低于市场预期，非农数据同样走弱，美联储降息预期升温，美元指数下滑至近4个月低点。\n小金属价格的大涨也带动了相应股票的上涨。Wind数据显示，截至3月12日，Wind小金属指数今年以来累计涨逾20%，3月12日的高点创近两年新高。今年以来，小金属板块内华钰矿业、宜安科技均累计涨逾80%，三祥新材、湖南黄金均累计涨逾50%，东方锆业累计涨逾40%，红星发展、罗平锌电、道氏技术、翔鹭钨业均累计涨逾30%，华友钴业、寒锐钴业均累计涨逾20%。",

    "text": "With energy production, [pollinator](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/how-to-make-your-yard-a-friendlier-place-for-pollinators/) protection, and crop growth promotion, [agrivoltaics](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/), an innovative approach to [solar power](https://www.thecooldown.com/solar-panels/), has the potential to provide a reasonable answer to growing rural backlash against solar power, support insect populations, and maximize benefits for both agriculture and [alternative energy](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/clean-energy-get-money-back-on-bill-solar-wind-power/) industries, per recent reporting in [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/). Burning coal, oil, and gas [for power](https://www.clarity.io/blog/a-deep-dive-economic-impacts-of-air-pollution) releases [toxic pollution](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/short-term-air-pollution-cancer-cardiovascular-disease-study/) into our atmosphere that can cause serious problems for our [health](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/air-pollution-effects-on-digestive-system-liver-pancreas/), [finances](https://www.clarity.io/blog/a-deep-dive-economic-impacts-of-air-pollution), extreme [weather](https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/how-air-pollution-amplifies-heatwave-extremes/), and more. [Solar power](https://www.thecooldown.com/solar-panels/) is a less expensive energy source that turns sunlight into energy without the accompanying [harmful pollution](https://energy.sc.gov/). As the [South Carolina Energy Office](https://energy.sc.gov/) wrote [on its website](https://solar.sc.gov/learn-about-solar/how-solar-works), \"[Solar] energy is free, immune to rising energy prices, and can be used to provide heat, lighting, mechanical power, and electricity.\" But responses aren't always so bright. Successful Farming [reported](https://www.agriculture.com/solar-and-wind-farms-generate-controversy-but-occupy-a-sliver-of-rural-land-8654435) significant setbacks to solar initiatives in rural regions — including adverse reactions from area residents and intense local government restrictions. The revolutionary technique of agrivoltaics, engineered to keep underlying farmland available for use, could change all that. Instead of placing [solar panels](https://www.thecooldown.com/solar-panels/) on [rooftops](https://cleantechnica.com/?s=tina+casey+agrivoltaic), agrivoltaics are strategically situated [on fields](https://cleantechnica.com/?s=tina+casey+agrivoltaic) to create [partial shade](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/), retain [soil water](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2024/soil-water-plant-interaction-basics), and increase crop production. This method means the same land can be used for farming and clean energy generation. Per [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/08/agrivoltaic-solar-arrays-will-win-the-rural-solar-war-with-insects/): \"Agrivoltaic solar arrays will win the rural solar war.\" Combining the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [Conservation Reserve Program](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-program/index) with incentives to pursue agrivoltaics would enable farmers to make money, preserve farmland, [protect flora and fauna](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/how-to-make-your-yard-a-friendlier-place-for-pollinators/), and prevent pollution, the CleanTechnica report noted. \"Evidence is also accumulating in support of the beneficial impacts on [pollinator](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/how-to-make-your-yard-a-friendlier-place-for-pollinators/) habitats and native flora,\" stated CleanTechnica — a high-value proposition considering [worrisome reductions](https://entomology.ucr.edu/news/2023/07/13/researchers-study-global-decline-insect-populations) in the global insect population. Those big wins have agrivoltaics gaining buzz. In June, the [New York State Energy Research and Development Authority](https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/) announced a $5 million program supporting agrivoltaic solar development, as reported by CleanTechnica. \"This initiative seeks to strike a balance between achieving renewable energy targets and supporting the agricultural sector,\" said [New York Ag Connection](https://newyorkagconnection.com/news/new-york-launches-5m-agrivoltaic-program-for-clean-energy), and sets a precedent for other states to potentially follow.

    "text": "The weather was cold outside, with freezing rain falling from the sky all day in Eugene. There were warnings coming from the county, encouraging people to stay home and off of the roads unless it was necessary to go out.\nIt appeared that the Oregon Ducks’ offense was heading that call early in this game, largely threatening to keep them out of this game in the first half thanks to poor shooting, and a lack of ball movement. However, they turned things around with a 16-2 run right before the half and found a way to pick up an impressive win at home over the California Golden Bears.\nIt marked Oregon’s 13th win of the season, and kept them a perfect 5-0 in conference play.\nHere’s everything you need to know about the game:\nFinal Score: Oregon 80, California 73\nThe Ducks overcame an 18-point first-half deficit to eventually down the California Golden Bears 80-73 at home, winning their sixth-straight game.\nKeys to the Game\nIt was a cold start to the game for Oregon as far as offense goes, with a 1-for-5 start from deep. The Ducks weren’t playing terribly on defense, but they lacked aggressiveness on the offensive side of the ball, settling for a lot of mid-range and deep shots that weren’t falling. While the Ducks struggled to get their shots, Cal couldn’t miss. A 7-0 run midway through the first half allowed the Golden Bears to ultimately build an 18-point lead, where they were shooting over 60% from the floor and 57% from deep. Oregon woke up late in the half, and went on a 16-2 run to close out the half and make it a 4-point Cal lead, which felt much closer than it should have been. Coming out of the half, both teams traded buckets for a while, with the Ducks ultimately taking the lead on a three-pointer from Jackson Shelstad. As the second half went on, Oregon built a small lead and held it for quite a while. They were up 73-67 by the final media timeout. Surprisingly, Cal chose not to play the foul game, allowing Oregon’s offense to hold strong in the final minutes as they went on to win the game, 80-73. Players of the Game\nJermaine Couisnard: 18 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assists Bam Tracey: 14 points, 4 rebounds Jackson Shelstad: 12 points, 6 rebounds Keeshawn Barthelemy: 12 points, 5 assists Key Stats to Know\nJackson Shelstad tied Tyler Dorsey for the most consecutive games scoring 10 points or more as a freshman since 2000. Shelstad finished the game with 12 points. After starting the game hitting just 1 of their first 5 three-pointers, Oregon settled in a little bit, hitting 9 of their next 23 from beyond the arc. N’Faly Dante made his return to the floor for the first time since the season opener, playing 17 minutes. He looked solid, putting up 8 points and 2 rebounds. The Ducks got a ton of production from their bench in this game, scoring 39 bench points on the night. Play of the Night ON. HIS. HEAD. 🔥\nKario finishes with authority! #GoDucks\n📺 @Pac12Network pic.twitter.com/P4iC5j3NUJ\n— Oregon Men's Basketball (@OregonMBB) January 14, 2024\nWhat's Next?\nThe Ducks set off for the infamous mountain road trip this week, playing against the Colorado Buffaloes on Thursday night, and then turning around and playing the Utah Utes on Saturday evening. Both the Buffs and Utes have been among the more impressive teams in the conference thus far, though injuries have been a factor as of late.",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — Data from Environment Canada has confirmed what winter sport enthusiasts have known for a while — December was warm in British Columbia.\nFive communities in the province set or equalled temperature records for the month while the warm weather, combined with a lack of rain or snow, has done little to ease ongoing drought concerns.\nMeteorologist Brian Proctor said the mean temperature at Vancouver International Airport last month was 7 C, tying with 1939 as the city's warmest December on record since data started being collected in 1896.\nThe mean temperature was 3.4 degrees higher than what is considered normal for the month.\nProctor said Tuesday that warm weather records for December were also either set or tied in Victoria, Comox, Campbell River and Abbotsford.\nThe month was also very dry, meaning there wasn't enough rain or snow to ease drought concerns in the province, he said.\nIn the northeastern municipality of Chetwynd, for example, less than a millimetre of precipitation was recorded in December. The community usually sees about 19 millimetres.\n\"In general terms, it hasn't been enough to alleviate the long-standing drought,\" Proctor said.\n\"It's helped to sort of pull it back a little bit, but what we really do need, more than anything else, is we need snowpack. And we're not getting snowpack out of these kinds of systems at this point in time.\"\nThe province's final drought update of the year, posted at the end of November, lists eight of B.C.'s 34 basins at the two highest levels of risk for adverse drought impacts.\nThe northeast corner of B.C., which includes the Fort Nelson and Peace regions, remains at the highest level of drought where adverse impacts are almost certain.\nProctor says the first full week of January is expected to get cooler with some snow possible at higher elevations\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said December wasn't warm enough to break records in British Columbia. In fact, Environment Canada now says multiple communities either broke or tied heat records.",

Neben Anwendungen im Gesundheitsbereich könnte es sich auch zur Umweltüberwachung nutzen lassen.\nFür den Schnelltest bläst man in ein Röhrchen, das mit diesem Filter ausgestattet wurde. Dabei landen winzige Tröpfchen der ausgeatmeten Luft, die bei einer Infektion Viren, Bakterien oder Sporen enthält, auf der Oberfläche des Filters. Diese können durch die optische Methode „Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy“ nachgewiesen werden. Hierzu bringt ein Laser die Proteinstrukturen in den Tröpfchen zum Schwingen: der sogenannte Raman-Effekt.\nDer Nachweis alleine reicht aber nicht aus, um eine genaue Diagnose zu stellen. „Es ist eine Herausforderung, die spezifischen Fingerabdrücke von Viren, Bakterien und anderen Mikroorganismen zu identifizieren, vor allem, wenn in den Atemtröpfchen eine Vielzahl unterschiedlicher Strukturen drinnen ist“, schildert Kostoglou die Komplexität der Aufgabenstellung.\nÖsterreich Neuesten Nachrichten, Österreich Schlagzeilen\nSimilar News:Sie können auch ähnliche Nachrichten wie diese lesen, die wir aus anderen Nachrichtenquellen gesammelt haben.\nFlorian Krammer warnt: 'Viele Viren haben das Potenzial zur Pandemie'Wie es um Covid, Vogelgrippe und Impflücken steht und welche Pandemie sein Schreckensszenario ist, erzählt der Virus-Experte im Interview.\nWeiterlesen »\nFleischfressende Bakterien töten vier MenschenBereits vier Todesfälle gehen im US-Bundesstaat im Jahr 2025 auf das Konto des Bakteriums Vibrio vulnificus.

By upgrading your graphics card, you can unlock the full potential of your gaming experience.\nA newer graphics card with advanced features and higher memory capacity allows for smoother gameplay, faster rendering times, and improved frame rates. Whether you’re exploring vast open-world environments or engaging in fast-paced multiplayer battles, an upgraded graphics card ensures that you never miss a moment of action.\nCrisp and Vibrant Visuals\nBeyond gaming, upgrading your graphics card can also greatly benefit creative professionals who work with graphic-intensive applications such as video editing software or 3D modeling programs. These applications require significant processing power to render complex visuals accurately.\nWith an upgraded graphics card, you can expect improved color accuracy, better shading effects, and smoother rendering times. This means that every detail in your artwork or project will come to life with greater clarity and vibrancy. From editing high-resolution videos to creating intricate 3D models, an upgraded graphics card ensures that your work looks its best.\nFuture-Proofing Your System\nTechnology advances at a rapid pace, especially in the world of computer hardware. What may be considered cutting-edge today could become outdated within a few years. By upgrading your graphics card, you are future-proofing your system and ensuring that it can handle the demands of tomorrow’s software and games.\nNewer graphics cards often come with the latest features, improved performance, and better compatibility with upcoming technologies. Upgrading now means you won’t have to worry about compatibility issues or being left behind as new software and games are released.\nIncreased Productivity\nGraphics-intensive tasks go beyond gaming and creative work. Many modern applications, including web browsers and streaming services, rely on hardware acceleration to deliver a smooth user experience. An upgraded graphics card can significantly improve the performance of these applications, resulting in faster load times, smoother video playback, and overall increased productivity.\nAdditionally, if you use your computer for tasks such as data visualization or complex simulations, a more powerful graphics card can greatly reduce processing times. This means that you can complete tasks more efficiently and spend less time waiting for results.\nIn conclusion, upgrading your graphics card is a worthwhile investment for gamers and creative professionals alike. The benefits of enhanced gaming performance, crisp visuals, future-proofing your system, and increased productivity make it an essential upgrade for those seeking to maximize their visual experience. So why wait? Take your computing experience to new heights by upgrading your graphics card today.\nThis text was generated using a large language model, and select text has been reviewed and moderated for purposes such as readability.",
