    "text": "FRIENDSWOOD, Texas — A Texas teenager accused of shooting two people at his home, one fatally, allegedly told police that he wanted to \"commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to newly released court documents. The suspect -- 17-year-old Connor Hilton -- was showing the two victims a revolver at his Friendswood home Saturday night when he allegedly shot them both in the head, according to a complaint charging the teen with murder. A third person who was at the house that night called 911 while hiding in the bathroom and reported hearing two gunshots, according to the complaint. Responding officers found Hilton outside the home appearing \"visibly distraught,\" the complaint stated. When asked by police if anyone was hurt, Hilton nodded yes then held up two fingers, motioned toward the house and said there were two teenagers inside he believed to be dead, according to the complaint. Once inside, an officer found two male victims -- identified as Ethan Riley, 18, and Benjamin Bliek, 19 -- lying on the floor with gunshot wounds as well as a revolver on a table, according to the complaint. A second officer located the 911 caller, who \"reported hearing Hilton walk by the bathroom door crying and stating, 'What have I done,'\" the complaint stated. The shooting victims were transported to local hospitals in critical condition. Riley succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, while Bliek remains in critical condition, police said. Hilton was brought in for questioning following the shooting and was initially charged by the Galveston County District Attorney's Office with two counts of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. He was released after posting $1 million bond before being arrested again at his home on Monday for murder, police said. He is currently being held at the Galveston County Jail on no bond. While being interviewed by police following the shooting, Hilton allegedly confessed to pulling the trigger and said there was no disturbance or disagreement that night, according to the complaint. He allegedly told police \"he had thought about, and wanted, to commit a homicide for a long time,\" according to the complaint. He allegedly said he had talked his mother into buying him a handgun, which he wanted \"with the intent of shooting someone and/or himself,\" according to the complaint. \"Hilton stated that he fully understands what he had done and that he should be held accountable,\" the complaint stated. Hilton's attorney, Jennifer Carpenter, told ABC News that his mother did not purchase a gun for him. \"The parents of Connor Hilton cannot express enough their deepest condolences to the victims' families who have been heavily on the Hiltons' hearts and minds as they try to navigate this devastating situation,\" Hilton's family said in a statement released through the attorney on Thursday. \"The Hilton family wants to thank everyone who has reached out in love and support, including all who sent positive comments about Connor's character and good nature in general,\" the statement continued. \"The family asks for continued prayers for everyone affected, especially the victims' families.\" His attorney has filed a motion seeking to conduct a hearing to determine whether his statements to police can be admissible in court, claiming they were not made and preserved in compliance with state law. Hilton is scheduled to appear in court for a status conference on Feb. 2, online court records show. Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "In view of the prevailing war situation in Manipur, the church bodies in the Northeast state have called for subdued Christmas celebrations. The development unfolds after observing that a lot of Christians in the war-torn state had no resources to go to church. Thousands of people have been displaced, and many people lost their families after the ethnic clashes broke out on May 3. While several churches have decided to skip the pre-festive cheers, some churches in Manipur have decided to organize the prayer services on Christmas morning only. Moreover, people have also desisted decorating churches and homes. Following the protest by hill-majority Kuki tribes against the valley majority Meitei tribes over their demand for the Scheduled Tribes (ST) policy, both have witnessed their worship places demolished by the mob violence. The Directorate of Information and Public Relations (DIPR) said in a press note that the ambience around Christmas is mostly subdued in the hill districts and some Christian pockets of Imphal valley this year. Besides, the churches have also requested people not to indulge in lavish spending and grand fasting. Instead, they have been advised to use their resources to help others in need.",

China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and military exercises near the island. Notably, Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949. However, China considers Taiwan part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary. So far this month, Taiwan has tracked over 300 PLA aircraft and around 200 Chinese ships. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of grey zone tactics by incrementally increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read Taiwan defence spend to outpace expected GDP growth as China threat rises Taiwan launches live-fire missile drills as China ramps up military threats Taiwan boosts efforts to stop Chinese boats from operating across borders Taiwan detects 13 Chinese aircrafts, 7 vessels near its territory Taiwan detects 11 PLA military aircraft crossing median line in its ADIZ Topics : Taiwan China Chinese air force Chinese navy Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "title": "With Funding Uncertain, All of Us Program Eyes Revisions, New Income Sources",
    "text": "With Funding Uncertain, All of Us Program Eyes Revisions, New Income Sources\nAn uncertain funding future has the NIH All of Us Research Program reconsidering priorities and considering additional sources of sustainability. In September a working group issued a [report](https://allofus.nih.gov/sites/default/files/AoU-Pioneering_Precision.pdf) with several suggestions for other possible funding sources.\nLaunched in 2018, the All of Us Research Program is a major initiative by the NIH to gather health data from one million or more people living in the United States. The program is building one of the most diverse health databases in history to accelerate precision medicine research and improve health by considering individual differences in lifestyle, environment and biology.\nIn fiscal year 2024, Cures Act funding for the program dropped by $184 million, while its base appropriation remained the same at the FY23 level, amounting to a 34% decrease in its budget. That necessitated funding cuts, decreasing enrollment capabilities, slowing new data collection, and delaying the ability to build a robust pediatric cohort.\nIn fiscal year 2025, which began October 1, 2024, Cures Act funding decreased again, by $199 million. The program’s base appropriations level has remained flat under a continuing resolution (CR), while Congress continues efforts to pass final FY25 appropriations bills. If funding is sustained at the current level of $158 million, this will represent a 71% reduction compared to FY23’s funding level and necessitate further reductions for our national network and greater impacts to activities program-wide.\nIn a recent blog post, Josh Denny, M.D., the program’s CEO, said the program is facing potential revisions to some of its plans and priorities that may affect the following activities:\n• Engaging communities historically underrepresented in biomedical research, including those living in rural America.\n• Maintaining the national network of enrollment hubs that has enabled us to enroll from across all 50 states and most U.S. territories.\n• Enrolling children to facilitate breakthroughs in child health, including rare diseases, and advance research across the lifespan.\n• Conducting longitudinal reassessment critical for understanding preventable and chronic health conditions.\n• Releasing new data for research and discovery.\nDespite the funding challenges, Denny highlighted some of the program’s achievements: New publications derived from All of Us data are coming out every day, offering new insights to improve prevention, screening, and health outcomes, he wrote.\nFor example, researchers using All of Us data have discovered more than 275 million previously unreported genetic variants, providing researchers new pathways to better understand the genetic influences on health and disease. All of Us researchers have improved precision medicine for certain cancer treatments, optimized genetic tests to more accurately predict disease risk for 10 health conditions, and identified different health problems linked to subtypes of type 2 diabetes.\nBeyond enabling advances in genetics, All of Us data is helping researchers speed up the search for promising medicines for Alzheimer’s disease, better predict hospital readmission for patients with sepsis, and improve prediction of glaucoma progression, enabling more precise approaches to care.\nDenny also noted that more than 14,000 researchers have registered for access so far, from over 1,000 institutions. With our innovative data access model, the median time from initial registration to data access is just 29 hours, compared to the months it typically takes researchers to gain data access through other programs.\nA Strategic Insights working group led by chair Stanford University’s Russ Altman, M.D., Ph.D., issued a report in September with several suggestions for other possible funding sources.\nAlthough the working group acknowledged that basic “core” funding must be provided from the federal budget, these core capabilities can be supplemented with additional endeavors to fully benefit from the value contained in the participant data and biospecimens.\nOne source could be ancillary and collaborative studies where the primary funding\ncomes from outside sources: private companies, foundations (including disease-specific ones), other government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. The working group said that the UK Biobank provides an example of managing the added value of ancillary/collaborative studies to enrich the resource at relatively low cost.\nAnother source of income could be from researchers via charges for using the data via its\ncompute infrastructure. The working group recognizes this as a potential funding stream, but\nworries that it would reduce enthusiasm for and use of the All of Us platform by researchers— particularly those with limited resources.\nThe working group also suggested that the program should consider management efficiencies to reduce core costs. It can continue to identify services that are critical for it to build and maintain in house, versus those that can be purchased and “re-competed” regularly to keep costs down. All of Us can investigate ways to streamline the processes of enrollment and retention, including the methods by which participants are informed of and recruited to ancillary/collaborative studies, the report said.",

    "text": "SEE IT: UK Tests Laser Weapon Called DragonFire That Can Shoot Down Missiles for Just $12 a Shot The technology 'has the potential to revolutionize the battlespace,' the UK Defense Secretary said [Dan Gooding](/author/dan-gooding) A laser powerful enough to [shoot down targets](https://themessenger.com/news/us-military-launches-another-barrage-of-missiles-against-houthi-sites-in-yemen) for the cost of running a heater for an hour was successfully tested by the British military, with sights now set on finally bringing the advanced tech into service. The DragonFire laser's successful test by the UK Ministry of Defense follows years of investigations and testing around the world, including [during President Reagan's term](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/rd/104253.htm), when the technology was first floated as part of a way to replace nuclear weapons. While the range of the [laser](https://themessenger.com/news/israel-to-have-laser-defense-system-in-place-next-year-defense-contractor) is being kept secret, the ministry said it could hit a £1 coin - about the size of a U.S. quarter - from around 0.6 miles away. Firing the intense beam of energy, which can cut through metal, typically costs less than £10 ($12) a shot. \"This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionize the battlespace by reducing the reliance on expensive ammunition, while also lowering the risk of collateral damage,\" Defense Secretary Grant Shapp said in a press release. \"Investments with industry partners in advanced technologies like DragonFire are crucial in a highly contested world, helping us maintain the battle-winning edge and keep the nation safe.\" The MoD said that the successful test, completed in Scotland, was a major step forward in bringing the technology into service after it was used to track moving air and sea targets previously.
