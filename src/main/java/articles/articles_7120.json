    "text": "Kharge warns democracy will be finished if BJP, RSS not stopped Mumbai: Sounding the bugle for the 2024 general election, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said that the coming polls will be a “battle of two ideologies” as “slavery” works in the BJP. He also promised a nationwide caste census if the Congress was voted to power at the Centre. Addressing a “Hai Taiyyar Hum” rally in Nagpur that kickstarted the Congress’ campaign for next year’s Lok Sabha polls, Mr Gandhi lashed out at the ruling BJP, saying the saffron party is run on an authoritarian ideology like that of erstwhile kings. “There is a fight of ideologies going on in the country. Their (BJP) ideology is the ideology of kings. They don’t listen to anyone, orders just come from above. Whereas in the Congress, the voices come from below, our small workers can point out the big leaders. I listen to our workers and also respect their voice (concerns),” Mr Gandhi said. The freedom struggle was not fought by the kings or rulers of that time, it was fought by the people of the country. Kings and rulers had a partnership with the British. The Congress fought against that partnership for the people of the country, he added. “Vice-chancellors are appointed not on the basis of merit but because they belong to a particular organisation. Unemployment is highest now in the last 40 years,” Mr Gandhi stated. The Congress leader also announced that his party will undertake a caste census if voted to power at the Centre. “We will undertake a caste census after coming to power at Centre, he said. After the Congress made a demand for a caste census, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s language changed and he started saying poverty was the only caste in the country. The Congress will carry out the caste census and give employment to youths, who are deprived of jobs, Mr Gandhi added. The Congress leader also said the BJP wants to take the country back to slavery, alleging that “ghulami” (slavery) works in the saffron party. “A few days ago, I secretly met a BJP MP in the Lok Sabha, who was previously in the Congress. He spoke out of fear, and tension was visible on his face. He said: “BJP mein ghulami chalti hai” (slavery works in the BJP), said the Congress leader. “The BJP leader said that whatever directions are received from the authorities above have to be followed without thinking twice. No one listens to us, orders come from above. It is just like how kings used to give orders earlier and everyone had to follow it. There is no choice whether you like it or not,” Mr Gandhi said. Addressing the rally, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the RSS and BJP have ruined the country in the last 10 years and if they are not stopped now, then democracy will be finished. The BJP made a mockery of democracy by suspending 146 Opposition MPs for asking questions and passing the bills in Parliament. The people should teach a lesson to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP for not respecting democracy, he added. While Congress’ former president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did not attend the rally, Telangana CM Revanth Reddy, Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhvinder Sukhu, Karnataka deputy CM D.K. Shivakumar, and former Maharashtra CMs Prithviraj Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde and Ashok Chavan were present on the occasion.",

    "title": "Ranking the Top 3 Best Bee Pollen Supplement Brands to Try (2024)",
    "text": "Sponsored Content Bee pollen has been all over social media in the last year, with people claiming the benefits range from combatting menstrual and hormonal issues to increasing the size of “the girls.” While there’s something to many bee pollen’s benefits, the quality ranges wildly between products. Like many supplements that go through a boom period, there are a lot of poor-quality imitations on the market with next to no brand credibility or testing for purity, but that does have an excellent website. Fortunately, if you’re wondering if bee pollen is for you, we have a list of the few companies that can be trusted to deliver the goods. Thus, you can get the health benefits of bee pollen without wasting your money on honey-colored sawdust. It’s also important to note that the compounds in bee pollen vary depending on the plant source and the season it was collected. For example, bee pollen collected from pine plants has approximately 7% protein, while pollen collected from date palm packs closer to 35% protein. The minerals and vitamins vary depending on the bee pollen as well. And, of course, people with a pollen allergy should avoid bee pollen. Different Forms of Bee Pollen There are essentially four different forms of bee pollen available: dried bee pollen, pollen in pill form, and then fresh and freeze-dried bee pollen, sometimes called bee pearl or bee bread, which are the ones you want. Freeze drying retains all nutrients, amino acids, and phytoestrogens and is much more easily stored; it’s also often what people mean when talking about fresh bee pollen. Dried bee pollen (unless it’s freeze-dried) is collected in its fresh form but undergoes a drying process that significantly reduces its nutrient values. Pollen in pill form is also dried and often contains more fillers than pollen, providing fewer health benefits. It’s also worth noting that royal jelly provides many benefits of bee pollen, so the best bee products contain a good amount. The Best Bee Pollen Supplements Below are our picks for [the best bee pollen supplements](https://becomingtrendy.com/best-bee-pollen-brand): - Kittie - Greenbow - Serenol Kittie – The Best Bee Pollen Supplement Overall Technically, [Kittie](https://becomingtrendy.com/kittie-formula) has two products that contain Spanish bee pollen: their greens powder, which is an exciting product for women in general, but that’s not what we’re focusing on, as this list is purely bee products. Kittie Bee Pearl contains the original royal jelly and beeswax, which are responsible for many benefits of bee pollen, especially for the immune system. Kittie does standardize for the flavonoids (the compounds that have any impact on health) such as quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin, as well as the phenolic acids like ferulic acid and coumaric acid. This is the good stuff that makes bee pollen work. The other good thing about Kittie Bee Pearl is that it’s dosed correctly, which aligns with the few studies on bee pollen. Maximize all potential health benefits with 2500mg of bee pollen and 500mg of royal jelly. This, in theory, covers everything from seasonal allergies and menstrual issues to antioxidants, heart and liver health, and even wound healing. - Pros - Reputable brand - Good dosage - Includes royal jelly, too Cons - Only available from their [website](https://becomingtrendy.com/kittie-formula) Greenbow – Best Certified Organic Been Pollen While it is technically quite challenging to guarantee a bee pollen product is 100% organic (because bees collect pollen from all over the place, and they don’t know if the flowers have been sprayed or not), Greenbow is as good as you’re going to get on that front. Their price point is pretty good at $20, and the quality is solid; it doesn’t have the royal jelly, but if you’re looking for something decent from Amazon, Greenbow is the way to go. There are more than enough reviews to support Greenbow as a product—it is good, straightforward bee pollen. Pros - Good price - Organic - Lots of reviews Cons - Could have royal jelly Serenol Serenol is a bee pollen-based PMS supplement that offers a natural solution to ease the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Utilizing bee pollen’s properties, it aims to alleviate common issues associated with the menstrual cycle. Although its marketing is a bit overhyped, it works for some people. Although there’s more evidence that bee pollen can help menopause than PMS, it still suggests some hormonal benefits. Focusing on simplicity and effectiveness, Serenol addresses mood swings and emotional distress that often accompany PMS. Its formula taps into the natural benefits of bee pollen to provide relief without the need for artificial additives. Serenol’s approach reflects a commitment to natural healing, providing a straightforward option for those seeking relief from hormonal fluctuations. Harnessing the power of bee pollen offers a pragmatic solution to the challenges of womanhood. If you’re looking for a PMS supplement, we recommend Kittie. They offer a combined supplement of bee pollen and other ingredients for the same price. We know we’re gushing about them, but we struggled to find three good brands for this list. Pros - Reputable brand Cons - Overpriced for what it is Choosing the Best Bee Pollen Supplement When selecting a bee pollen supplement, several factors should be considered to ensure you get a high-quality product that meets your needs. Here are the top considerations: Freshness and Source Freshness is crucial when it comes to bee pollen. Look for a reputable brand that keeps their bee pollen refrigerated or frozen during storage and transportation. Generally, Spanish bee pollen is considered the gold standard, although that’s not essential. Fresh bee pollen should dissolve into a powder when touched, while dried pollen will remain in its granular form with a rugged exterior shell. The freeze-dried powder is usually fine, but it must be frozen. Additionally, consider the source of the bee pollen. Opt for bee pollen sourced from reputable beekeepers prioritizing sustainable and ethical practices. Quality Control and Testing Choose a bee pollen supplement that undergoes rigorous quality control and testing processes. The manufacturer should test the pollen for purity, ensuring it is free from contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metals, and microbial pathogens. Look for supplements that have third-party certifications or adhere to industry standards to ensure the highest quality and safety. Storage and Packaging Proper storage and packaging are essential to maintain bee pollen’s freshness and potency. Ensure the supplement is stored in a well-sealed container to prevent exposure to moisture and air. Some brands may also offer individually sealed packets for added convenience and freshness. Recommended Dosage Follow the manufacturer’s recommended dosage instructions. Start with a small amount and gradually increase the dosage to assess your tolerance and response. It’s important not to exceed the recommended dosage to avoid potential adverse effects. Additional Ingredients Some bee pollen supplements may contain additional ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, or other herbal extracts. Consider your specific health needs and preferences when choosing a supplement with extra ingredients. Read the product label carefully to ensure you know all the ingredients included. Bee Pollen FAQs Here are some common questions about bee pollen and their answers: Q: Can Bee Pollen Be Used as a Weight Loss Aid? A: Bee pollen has not been proven effective as a weight loss aid. While nutrient-dense and may support overall health, it should not be relied upon as a solution. A balanced diet and regular exercise are essential for sustainable weight management. Q: Is Bee Pollen Safe for Children? A: Bee pollen is not recommended for children under two due to the risk of allergic reactions. For older children, it is advisable to consult with a pediatrician before introducing bee pollen into their diet. Q: Can I Take Bee Pollen if I Am Pregnant or Breastfeeding? A: If pregnant or breastfeeding, consult a healthcare professional before taking bee pollen. While bee pollen is generally safe, individual circumstances may warrant caution. Q: Can I Take Bee Pollen if I Have Asthma or Allergies? A: Individuals with asthma or allergies to pollen or bee products should exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional before consuming bee pollen. Bee pollen can potentially trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Q: How Should Bee Pollen Be Stored? A: Fresh bee pollen should be stored in a well-sealed container in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain its freshness and nutrient content. Dried bee pollen should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Q: Does Bee Pollen Help With Allergy Relief? Bee pollen is often considered a potential natural remedy for alleviating allergy symptoms. It is purported to desensitize the body to allergens.

    "title": "NFL news: Russell Wilson ‘likes’ tweets after being benched by Broncos",
    "text": "The Denver Broncos benched quarterback Russell Wilson on Wednesday, a move that will protect the team from having to pay the quarterback future salary that’s guaranteed for injury.\nHad Wilson suffered a serious injury in one of the team’s final two games of the 2023 season, $37 million of his 2025 salary would become locked in. Broncos coach Sean Payton insisted Wednesday that he made the decision in an effort to win , but multiple outlets have reported that the benching was financially motivated.\nWilson has not publicly spoken to the media since his benching, but he “liked” a series of tweets on Twitter/X that suggest Denver benched him for financial reasons, not his performance.\nIn today’s age of social media, “liking” the tweets is just as revealing of a statement as a literal statement from the quarterback. Wilson clearly seems to be endorsing/confirming the story that the Broncos threatened to bench him if he did not adjust his contract.\nWilson “liked” the following tweets on Wednesday:\nRussell wilson has the seven ties passer rating in the nfl, 26 passing TDs which ties him with Tua and Mahomes (with fewer INTS than either), and leads the NFL in 4th quarter comebacks and game winning drives.\nThere's no marrative from me bud. Just facts. https://t.co/eFQJXOuKx6\n— Benjamin Allbright (@AllbrightNFL) December 27, 2023\n𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄: The #Broncos threatened to bench Russell Wilson weeks ago if he didn’t remove his injury guarantees, per @Schultz_Report\nRussell Wilson’s benching by the Broncos today is solely financially related and has been in the works for weeks.\nThe Broncos approached… https://t.co/ez4iBwOiZY pic.twitter.com/WkM6hILc04\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) December 27, 2023\nRussell Wilson is now getting BENCHED despite outplaying some of the leagues biggest “stars”\nWilson 2023:\nPassing TDs: 26\nINTs: 8\nYards/Attempt: 6.9\nRushing TDs: 3\nMahomes 2023:\nPassing TDs: 26\nINTs: 14\nYards/Attempt: 6.9\nRushing TDs: 0\nMake it make sense… pic.twitter.com/UPxfJEjK4G\n— Fantasy Fanatics (@FFB_Fanatics) December 27, 2023\n. @Schultz_Report joins us to give us exclusive insight on what led to the benching of Russell Wilson. pic.twitter.com/6tIN46z7Bv\n— Speak (@SpeakOnFS1) December 27, 2023\nIf the Broncos would've beat the Patriots last week, would Russ still be benched today? 👀 @Schultz_Report weighs in pic.twitter.com/FByoY9f8e1\n— Speak (@SpeakOnFS1) December 27, 2023\nRussell Wilson might be getting cut this offseason but this was still one of the best throws of the season\npic.twitter.com/9QPngJWLVK\n— Kevin (@Daboys_22) December 28, 2023\nWilson also wrote a message on his Twitter/X page: “God’s got me. Looking forward to what’s next.”\nGod’s got me.\nLooking forward to what’s next.\n— Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) December 28, 2023\nWilson then ‘liked’ Robert Griffin III’s response to the QB’s tweet.\nMad respect for how you have handled this entire situation @DangeRussWilson\nWhen you were disrespected, you still showed respect. When you were threatened, you led your team to wins. When you were torn down, you kept building up your guys and never wavered. God’s got your back. https://t.co/XnpDd00MvG pic.twitter.com/lnl3ooTiWi\n— Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) December 28, 2023\nFormer teammate Geno Smith, who ended up replacing Wilson in Seattle, also tweeted a message of support for the quarterback:\nFREE 3\n— Geno (@GenoSmith3) December 27, 2023\nWilson, 35, seems unlikely to play again for the Broncos after being benched this week. Denver will have until March 17 to make a decision — after that deadline, Wilson will have $37 million become guaranteed for the 2025 season.",

    "text": "Photo: GC Images\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit star Mariska Hargitay was mistaken for a real cop while filming an episode of the show in New York City on April 10. Hargitay has been playing Detective Olivia Benson on the show for the past 25 years, the longest run of any character on a prime-time drama series.\nDuring a break in filming, a young girl wandered onto the set at Anne Loftus Playground in Fort Tryon Park and walked right up to Hargitay , ignoring the film crew and her scene partner Ice-T .\nThe girl believed that Hargitay was an actual police officer and asked her for help finding her mother.\nAccording to TMZ , Hargitay didn't miss a beat and immediately began to help the girl . Filming was held up for about 20 minutes as the cast and crew searched the park for the girl's mother, who was relieved when the two were reunited.\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit was recently green-lit for a 26th season, extending its reign as the longest-running prime-time drama series of all time.\nPhoto: GC Images",

    "text": "据环球时报8月13日消息，最近，国家网信办就美国英伟达算力芯片漏洞后门安全风险约谈该公司问题受到关注。与此同时，越来越多美国给芯片安“后门”的内幕也被曝光。\n　　8月13日，路透社又刊发独家报道爆料，美国秘密在人工智能相关芯片中设置追踪器，以发现“芯片被转运至中国的情况”。\n路透社报道截图\n　　报道称，据两位知情人士透露，美国政府已秘密在他们认为有可能被转运至中国的先进芯片目标货物中植入位置追踪装置。知情人士称，这些措施“仅适用于部分受调查的货件”。追踪器可为美方搜集个人或机构违反出口管制的信息。\n　　位置追踪器是美国执法机构数十年来一直使用的一种调查工具，用于追踪受出口限制的产品，例如飞机零部件。\n　　另外五名人工智能服务器供应链相关人士表示，他们知道戴尔和超微 (Super Micro）的服务器货物中使用了这些追踪器，这些服务器中包含英伟达和AMD公司的芯片。这些人表示，追踪器通常隐藏在服务器的产品包装中。\n　　两名参与服务器供应链的人士描述，2024年的一个案例中，一批搭载英伟达芯片的戴尔服务器不仅运输箱上装有大型追踪器，还在包装内甚至服务器内部隐藏了更小、更隐蔽的追踪装置。\n　　消息人士称，负责监督出口管制和执法的美国商务部工业与安全局通常参与这类行动中，另外联邦调查局（FBI）等部门也可能参与其中。\n　　对于美国限制对华出口先进人工智能芯片相关问题，中国外交部发言人林剑11日表示，中方反对将科技和经贸问题政治化、工具化、武器化，反对对中国进行恶意封锁和打压的立场是一贯、明确的。这种做法扰乱全球产供链稳定，不符合任何一方利益。\n标签：",
