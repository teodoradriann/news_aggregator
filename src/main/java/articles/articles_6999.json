    "text": "Mark Kistler, aka Commander Mark, stars in a new documentary, The Secret Cities of Mark Kistler, that tells the story of Kistler’s legacy and how it all happened. Corgan Pictures hide caption\ntoggle caption Corgan Pictures\nCommander Mark had big bright eyes and a wide mustachioed smile big enough to match his magnetic persona. He wore bright red military coveralls with a bandoleer filled with — not bullets, but magic markers.\nHis catchphrase was “Dream it. Draw it. Do it.” Back in the 1980s and early ’90s, millions of children tuned in to PBS to watch Commander Mark create magical worlds with his pen, teaching them how to draw along the way.\nAnd 40 years later, a new documentary — The Secret Cities of Mark Kistler — tells the story of Mark Kistler, the artist behind the shows The Secret City, Draw Squad and Imagination Station.\nCorgan Pictures YouTube\nBorn in Ohio, Mark Kistler grew up in Southern California, the youngest of five kids with a single mother who worked as a nurse. He says his mom encouraged him to follow his passion for art early on, buying him art supplies and letting him turn his bedroom closet into a tiny art studio.\nHe loved Disney animations and dreamed of becoming an animator. Then, as a teenager, he began teaching drawing workshops for kids, through his local parks and rec programming. There, he fell in love with teaching art and came up with a goal to teach a million kids to draw.\nIt didn’t seem a crazy idea, he says, because he really believed anyone could draw. Forty years later, he told me he still believes it. “If you can write your name, you can draw,” he says.\nBut how would he reach that goal? After all, he says, he was just a broke kid with a dream.\nOne day he was in an art store and noticed a rack of VHS tapes with titles like “How to Paint” and “How to Sculpt.” He didn’t see one that said “How to Draw.” He went to his local public television station to see if they’d give him a shot at hosting such a program. No way, they said.\nHe didn’t give up. In New York, he met with PBS producers, who also said no. They wanted a show about painting for kids, to ride the coattails of Bob Ross. Kistler pushed back on that idea, pointing out that paint was not as accessible to kids as a pencil and paper. Eventually, they let him try out his idea.\nKistler’s shows and subsequent how-to books, like You Can Draw in 30 Days, teach drawing fundamentals using a step-by-step approach based on copying and tracing. It differs from more traditional art classes that teach drawing from observation, or “realistic” art, but these methods are based on principles of drawing developed by the Renaissance masters.\nIn his approach, kids learn about composition, shading, foreshortening and other techniques in a fun environment that emphasizes practice over perfection.\nAll of this is done with a generous dose of showmanship and lessons about attitude.\nIn fact, watching Mark Kistler is kind of like listening to a self-improvement audiobook: “You can do this!” He believes drawing is the way to visualize and achieve your life goals.\nIf you’re a fan of the Memphis Group design movement, this TV set will make you giddy.\nPBS YouTube\nKistler’s style is certainly fun and encouraging, but is it just a gimmick or does it really teach kids how to draw? Is drawing really a skill, not a talent, like Commander Mark espoused?\nI asked Seymour Simmons, a retired professor of art and art education at Winthrop University in South Carolina, who wrote a textbook about the history of drawing.\nSimmons says drawing is an intuitive process that captures momentary brain processes and records them. He, too, believes it is a skill, not a talent, that humans have used to communicate for thousands of years, since they began making marks on cave walls long before formal written language.\nAnd if it is a skill, he believes it is something that should be taught. But there are many ways to teach drawing:\n“Drawing is observation, drawing is invention, drawing is self-expression, drawing is problem-solving,” he explains. “Drawing is a visual language.”\nSimmons says Mark Kistler has a great approach to drawing as ideation and invention. As Simmons puts it, “It’s a discipline, but it should be fun.”\nFor his part, Kistler believes that it helps to have a positive attitude when learning a new skill. Or as Commander Mark would put it: “Wave bye-bye to the stress bus.”\nThat’s the reason he created his character, and the cosmic world around him, so many years ago. He wanted to create a safe place for kids to try something new, mess up and not be afraid to try again. All so they could put to paper what was in their minds.\nAnd thanks to that young 18-year-old who wanted to teach the world to draw, many children across the globe — kids like me — got his message and fell in love with drawing, too. We followed along with Commander Mark at home, drawing goofy toucans, birthday cakes and castles.\nHis hope from the start was that his lessons might lay the groundwork for future engineers or scientists to design solutions to something big.\nThe whole point of education, Kistler believes, is to teach students to become problem-solvers. And he’s worried that arts education is sometimes forgotten, especially in times of budget cuts. “Science, technology, engineering and math are all very noble pursuits,” he says, “but you’ve got to have that creativity.”",

    "text": "Apoderado quiso evitar plan de educación sexual en colegio de Talca y Suprema le dijo no\nUn colegio implementó un nuevo Plan de Afectividad, Sexualidad y Género este año, con el objetivo de educar a los estudiantes sobre temas como la prevención del embarazo adolescente, las enfermedades de transmisión sexual, y cómo manejar la violencia sexual.\nEste plan también toca temas sobre la diversidad sexual y la idea de que el género puede ser visto como una construcción social, es decir, algo que la sociedad y la cultura definen y no solo la biología.\nEn el fallo judicial se puede apreciar que un padre del colegio no estuvo de acuerdo con este plan y presentó un recurso de protección, una acción legal para intentar detenerlo.\nArgumentó que el colegio estaba yendo más allá de lo que permite la ley, introduciendo temas de sexualidad y afectividad que, según él, podrían confundir o afectar negativamente a los niños.\nEl colegio respondió que todo se había hecho siguiendo las reglas. Señaló que habían informado a los padres sobre el plan y pedido su permiso para que los niños participaran, cumpliendo con la Ley Nº20.418, que es la que regula estos temas en la educación.\nLa Corte de Talca primero, y luego la\nCorte Suprema, decidieron que el colegio tenía razón.\nEn su fallo, la Corte Suprema explicó que el recurso de protección no es una herramienta para cuestionar las decisiones educativas que están bien fundamentadas y siguen la ley.\nTambién aseguraron que el plan no viola los derechos fundamentales de los niños, como el derecho a estar seguros y protegidos, ya que los padres tienen la opción de no permitir que sus hijos participen si no están de acuerdo con el contenido.",

    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported. The once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported. Here’s what we know about the date. Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated. FYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches. A palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. Numerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated. Here are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac : Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today 30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",
