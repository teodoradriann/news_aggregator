The Ghanaian government is currently undertaking an economic reform with a bailout package of 3 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund, hoping to rebound its economy.\nMENAFN28122023000153011029ID1107666108\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "El Hospital General “Rubén Leñero” ofrecerá reconstrucción mamaria gratuita para las mujeres sobrevivientes de cáncer con la condición de haber concluido su tratamiento en cualquier unidad de oncología de la Ciudad de México. [ÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6evSkGk1Ftej78ks0B) [SÍGUENOS EN EL SHOWCASE DE GOOGLE NEWS](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMKffiQswz_qbAw?hl=es-419&gl=MX&ceid=MX%3Aes-419) Te podría interesar Incluso si la mujer no cuenta con Seguridad Social o no es población abierta puede acceder al servicio, dijo la doctora Lya Vázquez Morales, jefa del servicio de Cirugía Plástica y Reconstructiva del hospital. Las interesadas en el servicio deben acudir al Centro de Salud IMSS-BIENESTAR más cercano a su domicilio y solicitar que se les dé un pase al “Rubén Leñero” donde los médicos realizarán una evaluación de su estado de salud para decidir si son o no candidatas. Te podría interesar Nadine Gassman, secretaria de Salud de la Ciudad de México, informó que este hospital tiene capacidad para hacer hasta 180 reconstrucciones mamarias al año y añadió que en lo que va del 2024 han ayudado a 110 mujeres. Resaltó la importancia de la reconstrucción mamaria, ya que para las mujeres el recuperar sus senos logran mejorar su autoestima, confianza y eventualmente recobrar su sexualidad. “La reconstrucción mamaria cambia la vida de las mujeres, les ayuda a recuperar el cuerpo, la autoestima y la sexualidad. Desde el gobierno de la Ciudad de México seguiremos trabajando con la red de servicios públicos para garantizar una atención integral” dijo Gassman. Lo que necesitas saber de este programa de cirugía reconstructiva Una vez que la mujer haya solicitado una referencia al hospital “Rubén Leñero”, el personal de salud hará una valoración del caso ya que el procedimiento y qué tan exitoso puede ser dependen del tipo de cáncer y la posible presencia de alguna otra enfermedad como diabetes, hipertensión u obesidad. En caso de que la mujer sea candidata los médicos le presentarán el material protésico que usarán para reconstruir su seno, los detalles sobre el relleno de los mismo (salino o de gel) se verán directamente en consulta. Luego los médicos dejarán pasar 35 días para iniciar con el procedimiento de reconstrucción con tejidos autólogos (tomados de la misma paciente) que pueden ser de la espalda, abdomen, glúteos, ingles o muslos para usarse durante la cirugía. Entre los grandes males En 2023 se registraron 8 mil 34 muertes de mujeres a causa de cáncer de mama, según el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI). Si el tumor se atiende cuando va comenzando la tasa de supervivencia es de 90%; si el mal se encuentra hasta que ya hizo metástasis sólo sobrevive 30% de las pacientes, de acuerdo con información de la Sociedad Americana de Cáncer. La autoexploración constante desde los 20 años y practicarse mamografías anualmente a partir de los 40 son de gran importancia para prevenir el cáncer de mama, que es la tercera causa de muerte para la mujer y el cáncer que causa más muertes en ellas, de acuerdo con información de la Secretaría de Salud de la Ciudad de México.
